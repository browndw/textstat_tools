EXT. TWA PLANE IN FLIGHT OVER LOS ANGELES - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With the myriad lights of the city beneath it. As the plane lands:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HUGE HANGAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Troop carriers filled with ARMED SOLDIERS are lined up before the hangar; several official cars filled with SECRET SERVICE MEN, four MOTORCYCLE POLICEMEN, and a caravan of three limousines complete the waiting entourage. The CHIEF of the SECRET SERVICE looks toward the airfield as the plane is heard taxiing in. He turns and gets into one of the limousines, followed by the others.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LONG SHOT - VEHICLES ON AIRFIELD

Coming toward camera. The plane looms in the f.g. A motorized stairway is on the way toward the door of the plane. The vehicles come to a halt before the camera.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIGH ANGLE SHOT - PLANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Armed Soldiers leap out of the troop carriers and form a cordon around the plane. The Secret Service Men get out within the circle of guards, wait for the door to open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JET DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It opens. GRANT steps out: in middle thirties, with the air of a man who takes nothing seriously -- his coverup for involvement. He turns to help JAN BENES out of the plane. Benes is Mittel European in dress and manner. Physically, he is Schweitzer at forty: the leonine head, the shock of hair. He carries a battered suitcase. In response to Grant's gesture, he precedes him down the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE FIELD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Benes reaches the last step, he is greeted by the Chief of the Secret Service, who shakes his hand, introduces him to several of his subordinates, and leads him to a limousine. Their words are lost in the din of jets. About to get into the car, Benes turns and moves back quickly to Grant, who is near the bottom of the stairs. Benes extends his hand. They shake warmly. Benes moves back toward the limousine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRANT - ON PLATFORM STAIRS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He watches as Benes gets into the limousine and the caravan takes off with the Motorcycle Escort. The Soldiers are climbing back into the troop carriers. Grant starts down the stairs, is lost to view in the general activity.

EXT. PICO BOULEVARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Down which the cavalcade speeds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT OF STUDIO (BACK LOT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cavalcade races through an area of dark warehouses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DESERTED STREET (BACK LOT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A rundown area. The cavalcade starts down the street. In the second floor of an otherwise dark house, a light is turned on and off, an evident signal. PAN DOWN to a heavy car, waiting in a narrow alley which opens into the street. Its headlights are off, the sound of its engine completely drowned by the concerted roar of the oncoming cars and motorcycles. As the cavalcade nears the entrance to the alley, one of the motorcyles comes speeding up from the rear of the escort. The car in the alleyway starts toward the entrance to the alley.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALLEYWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car starts hurtling forward at full speed. The front of the limousine is now visible. A broadside impact seems inevitable.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALLEY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The motorcycle from the rear reaches the limousine as the kamikaze car comes hurtling out like a motorized projectile. It hits the motorcycle -- a totally unexpected obstruction -- and sends the Policeman flying out of scene. It is sufficient to deflect the kamikaze car from its deadly aim. The car hits the rear of the limousine, sends it spinning out of control. The suicide car, also out of control, careens toward the opposite side of the street. The limousine smashes into a telephone pole, which brings it to a jolting stop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIMOUSINE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The impact throws Benes to the side. His head hits the door handle with stunning force, almost knocking him out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The kamikaze car slams directly into a brick wall. It instantly bursts into fire, engulfing the Driver. The fitful flames illuminate the otherwise dark street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LIMOUSINE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Chief of the Secret Service jumps out of the limousine, waves to a sedan to pull up, his shouts lost in the general turmoil. Other Secret Service Men are helping the dazed Benes out, shielding him. A sedan pulls up beside the limousine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SEDAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Chief of the Secret Service instantly hustles Benes into the rear. As he climbs in beside him, and the other Secret Service Men rush to the other side to get in, there is the sharp crack of a rifle shot. It shatters the rear window of the sedan, narrowly missing Benes. The Chief thrusts him onto the floor, sprawls on top of Benes to cover him, while shouting to the Driver to get going, his words indistinguishable in the confusion of more rifle shots, which sends glass and bullets ricocheting through the interior of the sedan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the eerie light of the burning car, the sedan can be seen speeding off, flanked and spearheaded by Motorcycle Police. The Secret Service Men and those in the sedans are left behind, firing toward the top floor of a nearby bullding from which the rifle fire came.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SERIES OF IMPRESSIONISTIC CUTS THROUGH CREDITS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Without divulging the nature of the hospital, the unconscious Jan Benes is seen undergoing a fast and thorough medical probe by TECHNICIANS and SPECIALISTS, using the latest equipment. Huge X-ray machines, Centrifuges whirling blood samples, EKGs, Encephalographs, and a variety of instruments used in cerebral examinations are featured. After the LAST CREDIT:

INT. CAR

Seated in the rear, Grant looks as if he has just been aroused from sleep and hustled into the car in a hurry. He is getting into his shirt, helped by a MAN beside him. There is a smudge of lipstick on his cheek.

They close their respective doors, leaving Grant alone in the car, looking out mystified into the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARKING AREA
</DIRECTION>

The two men move off together, until they reach what they obviously know is a proscribed distance from the car. Then they stop and look at it. For a moment nothing happens, then the ground seemingly starts to sink with the car.

Grant is startled to see the earth sliding up past the car.

LONG SHOT - ELEVATOR SHAFT

It now becomes apparent that the car has been resting on what is really the top of an elevator shaft. The sides of the shaft now become visible: it is seemingly bottomless.

Grant responds as the elevator finally comes to a halt.

The car is on the earthen platform. Two big doors open. A scooter bearing the distinctive insignia of the appears, driven by an M.P. wearing the same emblem. Grant gets out of the car, is waved by the M.P. into the scooter. He gets in, is driven away.

MALE and FEMALE OFFICERS, all in the uniform of the , are moving about busily. As the M.P. and Grant drive across the foyer, Grant eyes the Female CMDFs appreciatively. Their uniforms emphasize non-military points. The scooter reaches:

The OFFICER behind the desk looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your I.D. card, please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
Grant takes out a card with only an embossed number. The Officer places it into an IDENTIFIER. We see its screen is blank. After a moment, Grant's picture flashes on in color, in full view and profile. The Officer looks up at Grant, sees it is an exact likeness. He then extracts the card. The screen goes blank. He hands Grant the I.D. card. The scooter takes off, speeding down a long neon-lit corridor, marked off for scooter traffic: four lanes, two in each direction. Numerous doors leading to offices open on both sides of the walkways. Traffic is heavy. Grant is the only one in mufti. The scooter approaches doors over which lights flash:

They move to window overlooking the OPERATING ROOM, see the unconscious Benes being wheeled in for Surgery. His head is uncovered. The full shock of hair stands out against the white pillow. His body is draped in the usual manner. A battery of SPECIALISTS and MEDICAL ATTENDANTS, MALE and FEMALE, are moving about under the glare of beams focused on the Operating Table.

He flicks a switch. On the TV screen appears the INTERIOR OF DUVAL'S OFFICE. We see DUVAL, a brain surgeon in the middle forties. He has the manner of one totally dedicated to his work. At the moment, he is testing a ruby laser, narrowing the beam down to pencil-like thinness. Assisting him is CORA PETERSON. In the middle twenties, her attractiveness is matched by her efficiency, which is considerable. They work together smoothly, the result of long association. It is evident neither know they are being observed during:

	Grant's uniquely qualified for this mission. He's a Communications Expert and was a Frogman during the War. Besides, he brought Benes into this country, and the fewer people who know about him, the better. At any rate, you'll find Grant invaluable, should anything go wrong once you're under way.

<REID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's the overall Target Area...
	</DIALOGUE>
</REID>
<DIRECTION>
Reid presses a switch. A large anatomical map of a Brain flashes on a central screen. The ganglia and dendrites form a network, much like intersecting roads, in a detailed war map. The clot is a solid obstruction in the center. Grid lines cross the map vertically and horizontally as points of reference. The entire projection has a three-dimensional effect, since it is drawn in perspective.
</DIRECTION>
<DUVAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Benes' brain...near as we can map it stereotaxically...

He switches on a flashlight arrow, points to the clot.
</DIRECTION>
<DUVAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The clot's right here...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUVAL>
<DIRECTION>
He switches off the arrow and quickly flashes it on again, this time on the edges of the map. The arrow now probes and with draws from the base, center and top of the brain, like the animated technique of showing an attack which is repulsed at the perimeter.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- without damage to the intervening tissue...which would prove fatal to Benes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUVAL>
<DIRECTION>
He presses another switch. A startling OVERLAY OF THE BLOOD VESSELS OF THE HEAD AND NECK appears over the anatomical drawing of the brain, encasing it. The red-colored arteries and blue-colored veins form such an intricate maze, that finding one's way through it seems virtually impossible.
</DIRECTION>
<DUVAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The only way to reach it is via the Arterial System.

</DUVAL>
<DIRECTION>
Grant looks at Cora. She is busy making notes from the projected map. Owens is showing no undue reaction, apparently having been apprised.

<OWENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How small would that be?

</OWENS>
<REID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	About the size of a microbe.

	Reduced proportionately, you won't find it too strange --

<GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All in a day's work, sure. But I was thinking of the speed of the Circulatory System.

<MICHAELS>

	About forty miles an hour.

<REID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You won't be going anywhere near that fast. We're putting Benes in deep Hypothermia -- that is, freezing him low as compatible with human life. It'll slow down his heartbeat, Circulation, and all other physical processes.

<DIRECTION>
Owens begins polishing his glasses, indicating his inner qualms.
</DIRECTION>
<OWENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Even so, because of our size -- I mean lack of it -- we'll still be cruising mighty fast. We'll be smashed to bits if there's any turbulence --

INT. CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The five appear and stop before a cylindrical door with handles similar to those in a vault, to give the effect of a sealed chamber within. Over the door flashes:

<DIRECTION>
INT. CONTROL TOWER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A huge plastic bubble in the form of a truncated semicircle, with glass panels overlooking areas not visible in the angle of the shot. TECNICIANS in the uniform of the are seated at a desk-level bank of monitors, on a slightly raised platform. They are checking the numerous TV screens for focus. A cacophony of B-Beeps from the screens underscores the sense of last-minute preparations. A COMMUNICATIONS AIDE wearing headphones and throat microphone moves about. Carter crosses to the Miniaturization Control Panel. Reid goes to the window overlooking the OPERATING ROOM. Below, he can see Benes on the operating table, a towel over his head. Surgical Aides are making a last-minute check of the Thermal Blanket which encases him in three sections. Reid presses a button on the wall beside the window.
</DIRECTION>
<REID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Make the final preparations...
	</DIALOGUE>
</REID>
<DIRECTION>
They begin to remove the towel from Benes' head. Reid turns away from the window and crosses to the window overlooking the MAIN OPS ROOM. With him we see a huge room, bisected by a floor-to-ceiling detailed map of the entire ARTERIAL and VENOUS SYSTEM from rib-cage to skull, to simulate the body of Benes in a prone position. Grid lines mark off areas in relation to true North and South. TECHNICIANS are bustling about with charts and reports which are coming in through headphones, telephones, teletypes, batteries of Computers, Oscillographs, etc. Encircling the entire floor are glass-fronted booths which enclose the SPECIALISTS' POSTS. Reid turns to a Technician at the Master Control Section.

</REID>
<DIRECTION>
The Technician flips on a switch. On a TV screen appears the INTERIOR OF THE HEART POST, one of the glass-enclosed booths looking out onto the MAIN OPS ROOM. Like all the Specialists Posts, it is concerned with its particular area and nothing else: Blowups of the Heart in great detail, X-rays of Benes' heart, its beat being recorded electronically on a huge EKG chart which fills one wall and is in constant operation via remote control. The HEART SPECIALIST is standing before the EKG chart, while a TECHNICIAN twirls dials at a panel. Reid can be seen in the closed TV circuit in the Heart Post. (As in all subsequent TV communications.)

The Technician flips on another switch. On a TV screen appears the INTERIOR OF THE RESPIRATION POST. Here everything relates only to the lungs. In addition to cut-away sections where each small area assumes the proportions of a detailed war map, there are banks of Benes' X-rays, lit up in panels, plus immense calibrated charts labeled INHALATION and EXHALATION, on which the rate is being electronically recorded.

On a TV screen appears the INTERIOR OF THE HYPOTHERMIA POST, its walls festooned with dials recording bodily temperature, before which TECHNICIANS sit watching and making minute adjustments. The HYPOTHERMIA SPECIALIST moves along, keeping a sharp eye on the various zones labeled: CIRCULATORY, RESPIRATORY, CARDIAC, RENAL, etc.

INT. STERILIZATION CORRIDOR

Bathed in eerie ultra-violet light. The five are passing down the corridor, in single file. All are dressed in khaki uniforms. Grant moves ahead of Cora. As they reach a vestibule at the end, the door swings open automatically. Grant starts to help Cora over the threshold.

Grant grins. They move into:

<DIRECTION>
INT. MINIATURIZATION ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A huge parquet area, composed of white octagonal modules. In the center is the Zero Module, in red. Standing over it is a fifty-foot craft. The angle and the distance renders its details indeterminate. WHITE-CLAD TECHNICIANS wearing rubber gloves are seen working about it. As the five come into the room:

THE PROTEUS - OVER THE ZERO MODULE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With Grant and the others, we now get the full impact of the experimental sub at close range: sleek lines from the intake in the nose sweep over a transparent plastic bubble atop the structure, and then down to taper off at the stern under which are double vents. The sub is supported by cradles, allowing it to stand free of the module. Plastic windows in the bow afford the occupants a full view. A white- Clad Technician hands Owens a small lead box.

Carefully holding the lead box, Owens starts up the ladder, followed by Duval, then Michaels. Grant waves Cora to precede him. They reach the monk's steps above the ladder, climb upward, then one by one disappear through the hatch. Grant is the last one in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PROTEUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With Grant we see the interior. There are plastic windows in the bow. In the center is the Navigation and Communications kiosk, which contains charts, reports, and a wireless set. Four swivel chairs are spaced about the kiosk. Behind it, a ladder leads to the Conning Bubble above. Set in the rear of the kiosk is a watertight door leading into the escape hatch. Behind the kiosk is a Lab and Storage Section, not visible at the moment. No power of any kind is on -- lights or air-conditioning. The interior is illuminated by the light coming in through the plastic windows. Duval, Michaels and Cora instantly move to the kiosk and busy themselves examining the charts and reports in the numerous pigeonholes. Owens hands the lead box to Grant.
</DIRECTION>
<OWENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold this...

Grant takes the lead box. Owens removes a crank from the tool box, inserts it into a hole in a circular trap door which reads:

Owens turns the crank. The lid of the trap door opens. A hollow cradle comes up. Owens then opens the lead box by undoing two butterfly screws. He removes the Seed Cage from within the box.

He puts the Seed Cage on the cradle and lowers it back beneath the floor, by reversing the crank. During the above:
</DIRECTION>
<GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If it's no military secret, how can a sub run on a microscopic particle?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<OWENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They can't reduce nuclear fuel. But once the Reactor's Miniaturized -- along with the submarine -- a microscopic particle should emit enough energy to activate it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OWENS>
<GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's cutting it mighty close -- for a perfect fit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<OWENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It should work -- theoretically. If it doesn't, the mission's off. The craft's nuclear-powered. Except for your wireless.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OWENS>
<DIRECTION>
The lid of the trap door is now level with the floor. Owens removes the crank, and taking the lead box from Grant, he puts both back into the tool box during:

Grant is at the wireless, logging the incoming message. In the meantime, Owens finishes battening down the entrance hatch. Duval is studying medical reports, Michaels is spreading out the first of the Navigation Charts, a very detailed map of the Vascular System of the Neck and Head. As Owens crosses on the way to the ladder leading to the Bubble:

INT. CONNING BUBBLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An ultra-sophisticated set of controls, consisting of a push-button panel and an airplane-like steering wheel. The plastic affords a 360 degree view of the Miniaturization Room. There is room for only one person. Owens remains on the ladder, so that only his head is within the Bubble. Owens points to the identical Repeater on the Panel.

Originally designed for marine research, it still shows some of its pre-adaptation structure: there is a series of glass-fronted compartments, now labeled ANTIBIOTICS, ANTI-COAGULANTS, COAGULANTS, MED OXY, etc. A wide counter runs the length of the compartment on one side, suitable for working on specimens. A Ruby Laser sits on the counter at the end, its plastic cover removed and to the side. At the other is a piece of metal on a metal base. As Grant enters, he sees Cora working with a set of very small tools, making minute adjustments on the laser.

She turns abruptly, gets into one of the seats and starts putting on her harness. In the meantime, Michaels appears from the aft compartment, checking off a few items on the bottom of his list as he moves quickly to the kiosk. He places the list into a pigeonhole, sits down, quickly straps on his harness.

Everything battened down, he now checks Cora's harness, then does the same with Duvalls and Michaels'. All are now sweating. Finished with Grant's harness, Owens moves quickly up the kiosk ladder leading to:

Owens drops into the seat, and with the speed of much practise, slips into his harness.

What appeared to be a solid wall at the end now slowly starts to slide apart, gradually revealing:

A huge, honeycombed disc, suspended from a rail running along the ceiling, begins to roll silently toward the sub.
</DIRECTION>

As Grant gets his first sight at what is going to shrink him, he reacts quite convinced. He glances at Duval, Michaels and Cora. They, too, are looking at the oncoming Miniaturizer, but with none of his response. They apparently have seen it before.

The lack of ventilation and the tension is causing Grant and the others to sweat profusely.

From his vantage point, Owens can see the light of the Miniaturizer reach the peak of intensity.
</DIRECTION>

A light flashes on the panel. With Carter we see a grid on the Technician's Control Panel as it becomes activated. Two blips from the co-ordinates marked and flash on. Reid remains at the monitors, eyes on the charts which keep flashing on, sending Benes' temperature, heartbeat, etc.

<DIRECTION>
The light is bathing the entire sub in an iridescent glow. There is a dull hum.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PROTEUS

<DIRECTION>
With Grant we get the first realization that the sub is shrinking: the proportions of what he can see in the Miniaturization Room are changing. He looks about him in a moment of wonder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DUVAL AND MICHAELS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From their vantage points at the kiosk tower, they can see a little more of the outside than Grant. They respond like scientists: with intense absorption in the process.

She responds enthralled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OWENS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Up in the Bubble, he gets the unlimited view -- and he is transfiXed. For now the Miniaturizer stretches far, far up, and the honeycombed light from the Miniaturizer disc seems as distant as stars. The walls of the room are barely discernible in the distance.
</DIRECTION>

The final subjective reaction as with him we see:

INT. MINIATURIZATION ROOM - P.O.V. CONTROL TOWER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now with Carter we get the first view of the shrinking Proteus as they watch it shrink down, down, down in the center of the Zero Module, which we see is laced with intersecting lines. When the sub reaches the size of a capsule about the length of a centimeter, Carter looks down at the grid on the Technician's Control Panel. He sees the blips on the co-ordinates approach closer and closer until they finally merge into one. He looks back at:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MINIATURIZATION ROOM - P.O.V. CONTROL TOWER

The lights at the bottom of the Miniaturizer's disc go off. The hum stops. At this distance, the sub looks like a speck on the floor.

Grant and the others respond as the vast parquet floor with its maze of hexagonal lines seemingly stretching into infinity suddenly begins dropping beneath them. The effect is that of becoming air-borne.
</DIRECTION>

With Owens we get the unobstructed view: everything is falling far, far below. The bottom of the Miniaturizer seems an infinite distance above.

INT. MINIATURIZATION ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A panel slides open and a precision handling device is rolled in by several WHITE-CLAD TECHNICIANS. A NURSE follows, in uniform. The machine is fourteen feet high, consists of pulleys on a tripod, which control a vertical arm angling down from a horizontal extensor. Two sets of mechanical fingers are on the vertical arm, about a foot apart. Together they act as clamps. All adjustments are controlled by various worm-gears. As the tall tripod rolls by, on the side of the base we see stamped: MIN PRECISION HANDLING, under the insignia of the .
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PROTEUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grant and the others react to the first sight of the oncoming in relation to their own reduced size: a button is immense, a shoe -- although far down from their position on the Zero Module -- is long as a city street, the heads gargantuan atop skyscraper-tall bodies. The precision handling machine itself is beyond recognition, owing to its vast proportions.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MINIATURIZATION ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tripod is eased to a stop so that its vertical arm is directly over the Proteus on the Module. A TECHNICIAN at the gear box starts turning a worm-gear control, which lowers the vertical arm toward the capsule-sub.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PROTEUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grant reacts as huge steel fingers at the bottom of the arm slowly slide into view. He glances at Cora and the others. They apparently know what to expect, but watch with the interest of scientists. The mechanical fingers slowly disappear beneath the sub.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MINIATURIZATION ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Technician maneuvers the mechanical fingers carefully so that they slip under the cradle of the sub, in effect becoming its holding fork. Once the steel fingers are in place, the Zero Module sinks below the floor from view, while the tripod holding the Proteus is eased back.

A Technician presses a switch.

CYLINDRICAL AMPULE - MINIATURIZATION ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A glass ampule about as tall and round as a small silo starts coming up out of the floor on the Zero Module. The transparent container is filled with a clear liquid, two-thirds to the top. It rests on an encircling cork base. The lettering at the base reads: SALINE SOLUTION.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CYLINDRICAL AMPULE - P.0.V. PROTEUS

Grant and the others react to what appears to be something big as an illuminating gas storage tank -- albeit filled with liquid.

With Carter we see the tripod with the Proteus brought to a stop close to the saline solution.

The Technician at the tripod moves it so that the claw holding the Proteus is directly over the water in the ampule.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PROTEUS

<DIRECTION>
Grant and the others react as they see themselves suspended over what appears to be a huge lake far below, bounded by cylindrical glass walls in the distance. Reflected light bounces off the top of the water, with iridescent effect. Suddenly they begin to descend. Grant and the others react as they seem to be dropping at suicidal speed toward the water which is rushing up to meet them as if they were in a dive-bomber. Then as the surface nears:

Within the high walls of the ampule, the capsule-sub is deposited into the water. Despite the delicate handling:

It 'hits' the water, jarring all within, as at a launching from drydock.

INT. MINIATURIZATION ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We now see the sub for the first time beneath the surface of the saline solution: a small capsule submerged at an even keel, about one- fourth of the way down in the huge transparent container. The Modules on which the ampule rests now return to floor level.

Again we first get the view of the shrinking process: Grant and the others see everything rushing away into an immensity of distance. And all the time the reflected light which has illuminated the interior of the sub is diminishing. We see the reason:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MINIATURIZATION ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The view: the ampule has shrunk way below the Miniaturizer. Its far smaller size reflects only a spark of light. The sub is now only a particle, shrinking with the ampule. The Technicians and Nurse look on, grouped at the tripod which is beyond the range of the Miniaturizer.

The Technicians move the tripod so that the vertical arm is brought directly over the ampule and lowered, until the two sets of mechanical fingers clamp the cylinder firmly. Then the ampule is raised a few inches from its position on the module. The reduced cork base still encases the bottom. The Nurse and a Technician move to the ampule. He holds a small instrument case.

When they reach the clamped ampule, the Technician opens the case. The Nurse takes out a plunger. Very carefully, she begins to insert it into the top of the ampule without disturbing the liquid. She then gently pulls away the cork remaining at the base of the ampule, revealing a small opening in the center. But owing to the pressure above, the liquid does not run out. She takes a needle out of the case and carefully fits it into the nipple. We now see the ampule is actually a hypodermic syringe.

Benes is lying under a thermal blanket, covered up to the collarbone. Thin rubber pipes lead out from the blanket to the Central Thermal Unit under the operating table, out of the way of everyone. A TEAM OF GAUZE-MASKED SURGEONS AND ASSISTANTS stand grouped around the unconscious patient.

CLOSE SHOT - BLIP ON TV SCREEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Duplicating the blip seen in the Tracking Post. We see the blip is heading down, at an angle identical with that of the hypo. CAMERA MOVES IN on the blip, and keeps moving until it fills our entire screen and becomes:

Diving at a terrific speed, steeply angled like the hypo, through the clear saline solution.

All hold on as if riding a roller coaster at its steepest plunge. Suddenly all goes pitch-dark.

<DIRECTION>
INT. BUBBLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Only the buttons are glowing, and the Minute Recorder, which now reads
<57>. Owens throws a switch. Through the plastic windows the headlights of the sub are seen coming on. They pierce the darkness sufficiently to catch the side of the steel wall of the needle, which is rushing past at a tremendous speed, giving the effect of an enclosed channel. The beams gradually reveal:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HOLE OF NEEDLE - P.O.V. BUBBLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small aperture in the distance, barely visible.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HOLE OF NEEDLE - P.O.V. PRINCIPALS IN KIOSK

Grant and the others see the opening at the end of the needle becoming bigger and bigger, apparently rushing toward them with great speed.

It fills the screen, an immense aperture in relation to the tiny sub which suddenly comes shooting out of it.

MAIN OPS ROOM - P.O.V. CONTROL TOWER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reid and Carter observe the Grid Officer, wearing headphones and throat mike, move up to the Arterial Map with a tiny replica of the Proteus. He places it in the center or the huge channel in the neck, which depicts the Carotid Artery. The little sub is held magnetically on the grid. The Minute Recorder now reads
<56>. Reid turns from the window, moves to the Map Case, which contains the same assortment of charts as in the sub's kiosk. Reid takes out an OVERLAY MAP OF THE HEAD AND NECK. He places it on a Radarscope. The blip shows it is traveling up the Carotid Artery.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LONG SHOT - ESTABLISHING - PROTEUS IN ARTERY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The headbeams of the speeding sub reveal a world of dazzling color and beauty: the Arterial Stream. The walls of the vast amber-colored chamber are lost in the distance. Now the screen is filled with a floating wonderland: huge red corpuscles, whirling globules, platelets, particles, minuscule fragments drift with the stream, reflecting the entire spectrum of color.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUBBLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Owens is slowing down the sub. He gazes in awe at:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ARTERIAL ELEMENTS - THROUGH BUBBLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the Proteus moves through the swirling conglomerations, the elements are parted, flow over the sub, bounce about it, forming new fluid galaxies in a universe of amber. And each grouping and regrouping, every mass and disc, though loosely linked, has a . Thus the Corpuscular drift, the bouncing particles, the parting and the merging achieve a majestic choreography lyrical in quality, a fugue of motion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PROTEUS

Grant and Cora, strapped in their seats, look on enthralled at the sheer beauty of the dancing wonder-world visible through the windows. Duval appears equally moved. Michaels observes with more clinical detachment.

Approaching camera, with the three people looking out of the bow windows in speechless wonder at what they behold.

INT. PROTEUS - SHOOTING OVER THEIR BACKS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment the three gaze in silent awe at the dancing drift directly outside: nuclei are clearly visible in the cells; variegated tiny organisms sweep like cosmic dust through the orbits of the spinning globules. Their first sight of the interior world, with its beauty and rhythmic splendor has affected them deeply. Finally breaking the silence:

Owens reacts, tries to slow down the sub and steer it back into the middle of the channel. But the speed increases, and the sub continues being swept toward the Wall.

INT. BUBBLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Owens is trying to gain control of the sub. It begins to vibrate. Startled, Owens peers out, trying to determine the cause, but the beams reveal nothing ahead but an iridescent swirl of Arterial elements which bounce back the light. The buffeting increases rapidly. The Arterial Wall is clearly visible to the side, getting closer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PROTEUS - IN BOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grant and Cora exchange startled looks as the membranes of the Arterial Wall suddenly become visible in the spill of light from the headbeams: its connective strands arch Gothic-like, lost in the darkness of the vaulted enclosure. The vibrations have now increased so that all must hold onto stanchions for support.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DUVAL AND MICHAELS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gripping the console for support. Through the plastic windows to the side they can see the Arterial Wall looming with menacing closeness. They look at each other, unable to fathom the cause of the now-greater vibrations.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUBBLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Owens is desperately trying to avoid a head-on collision with the Wall, but the sub won't respond to any of his manipulations. The Wall looms closer, the buffeting is worse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PROTEUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smashing into the Wall directly ahead seems inevitable. Now the connective strands almost fill the windows. Cora closes her eyes, in anticipation of the fatal impact. And just when a collision appears inevitable, the sub veers, narrowly missing the cable-like strands, thick enough to support a bridge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUBBLE - PARALLEL TO ARTERIAL WALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With Owens we see the sub swept close alongside the Wall. It is evident the craft is out of his control, and that whatever averted the collision has nothing to do with his attempt to steer it. The swirling mass of particles up ahead begins to part. The vibrations [LINE OF DESCRIPTION CUT OFF]

He grabs Cora, and against the buffeting, moves quickly to help her toward her seat. Duval and Michaels instantly take their seats at the console, begin getting into their harnesses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LONG SHOT - THE WHIRLPOOL - P.O.V. BUBBLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Owens is appalled as in the distance, in the center of the channel, he sees what appears to be an immense liquid centrifuge rotating at great speed, the Arterial elements within it whipped about like the contents of a mixmaster. Now the buffeting is reaching its climax. The sub is inexorably approaching the rim of the whirlpool, with Owens desperately trying to steer away from it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PROTEUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Duval and Michaels are in their harnesses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRANT AND CORA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowed up by the intense buffeting, Grant is now helping Cora into her seat. But before he can assist her into the harness, the sub is caught in the whirlpool. The instant effect is that of a Carnival Whip. The centrifugal force flings Cora out of her seat against the bulkhead. Grant is spun around and slammed against the opposite part of the bulkhead, and then onto the floor, with stunning impact.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DUVAL AND MICHAELS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pinned back in their seats, unable to get out and help as they see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRANT AND CORA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Helpless in the whiplike rotation, Cora is thrust from the bulkhead onto the floor. Grant manages to grab a stanchion, hold on. With his free hand he reaches out for Cora, now prone on the floor. She extends her hand, but a foot separates them. They desperately reach out to each other as the centrifugal force pulls them farther and farther apart... Grant takes the only possible chance or reaching her: he lets go of the stanchion which sends him slamming against the base of the seat. He grips the leg of the seat with one hand and grabs Cora's waist with the other, just in time to prevent her from again being flung against the bulkhead. She holds onto him with all her strength. Grant strains to maintain his grip on the leg of the seat with his free hand, which in effect holds them both against the centrifugal whipping.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUBBLE - TO INCLUDE WHIRLPOOL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Owens, too, is thrust back in his seat, powerless to move. The sub is completely at the mercy of the whirlpool. A gauge on the panel is registering in circles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PROTEUS IN WHIRLPOOL - LONG SHOT

<DIRECTION>
EXT. PROTEUS - NEARING VORTEX
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is whipped around and down in the final circle -- and disappears through the rapidly rotating center...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PROTEUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The steeply angled dive causes greater strain on Grant as he keeps his grip on Cora. Duval and Michaels are now thrust forward as if they were in a gondola of a shoot-the-shoots making its steepest descent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUBBLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a similarly forward-tilted position, with Owens we see the stream whipping by in a seemingly endless drop. And then ahead there suddenly appears:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LONG SHOT - FISSURE IN ARTERIAL WALL - P.O.V. BUBBLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An immense crack through which some red corpuscles are streaming in an eddy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PROTEUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From their prone positions on the floor, Grant and Cora react to the huge fissure looming through the windows. Duval and Michaels exchange looks, suddenly realizing what it signifies. Now the immense crack is directly ahead.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. PROTEUS - FISSURE FROM WITHIN VEIN

<DIRECTION>
As the tiny sub is swept out into the stream, where the blue corpuscles are. Through the crack, a stream of red corpuscles are whipping by on the other side. The angle of the dive now becomes less oblique.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUBBLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sub is caught in a less turbulent current, which results in its gradually losing its angle and speed, permitting Owens to steer it away from the center toward a more placid area.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PROTEUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sub is now level, moving much slower. Exhausted from the ordeal, Grant sees it is safe to let go of Cora. He helps her rise. She stares dazed at the bluish stream. Duval and Michaels, equally spent, begin to get out of their harnesses.

	You are heading in the opposite direction of the Target Area, as a result of crossing over into the Jugular Vein. Since you are in a closed system, you will have to go through the Heart and proceed on your mission by taking an alternate route. We will stop Benes' Heart for exactly sixty seconds. Maintaining maximum speed, you will get through in fifty- seven seconds. That will give us three seconds to spare in which to revive him. Stand by for exact instructions --

He steps into the cabin in time to hear:

	All we have to do is hook up the snorkel to that air chamber you were talk1ng about, and when Benes inhales, there should be plenty of pressure to force the oxygen into the tank.

As Owens considers the possibility:

Grant moves to the aft compartment, opens the door, goes into:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LAB AND STORAGE SECTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he moves to compartment containing the Underwater Gear, he is jolted by something he sees o.s.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LASER OVER WORKING COUNTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is swinging loose on one hook, its plastic cover off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
Grant takes a step toward it, stops.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cora!

After a moment, she appears. She follows his look toward the laser, reacts aghast.

<GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looks like you didn't batten it down too well.

</GRANT>
<CORA>

Duval and Michaels appear in the doorway in time to hear:
</DIRECTION>
<GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then how come it worked loose?

</GRANT>
<CORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have no idea.

As he takes out the Underwater Gear and passes it to the three:
</DIRECTION>
<CORA>
<DIRECTION>
(righting laser)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't imagine how it possibly could have come loose. I distinctly recall fastening it with all four bolts --
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORA>
<MICHAELS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It must have been jarred loose during the whirlpool.
	</DIALOGUE>

Grant and Michaels exchange looks, as if neither are satisfied with the explanation.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
(of gear)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, let's get into these as quickly as possible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
He leads the way out. Michaels and Duval follow. Left alone, Cora starts to unzip her jumper, revealing she is wearing her swim suit beneath. Her eyes remain on the laser, now her prime source of anxiety...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MAIN OPS ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Starting on the grid map, we see the sub in the channel of the Pulmonary Artery. CAMERA then TILTS DOWN to the Radarscope, where the blip is blinking on and off in one place, without moving.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONTROL TOWER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the monitor at the Map Table, we see the INTERIOR OF THE TRACKING POST, where the same blip is in the identical stationary position on the Radarscreen. PULL BACK to include Reid staring at the blip on the monitor. Carter is pacing on the other side of the table.

(glancing at Monitors; none are on)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It must be some kind of mechanical difficulty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REID>

The tapping stops. As they wait for an answer, Carter pours a stream of sugar into his coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<REID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you to cut down on the sugar.

INT. PROTEUS - AT DOOR OF ESCAPE HATCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All have stepped out of their jumpers and are now revealed in their swim suits except Owens, who remains in the Bubble. The suits are form-fitting, antiseptic-looking, with a Breather Pack strapped to the back. Duval is tightening Cora's pack. Grant is checking Michaels' pack. The latter looks in rear at the small hatch, visible through the open door. The wireless starts tapping again.
</DIRECTION>
<CORA>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not now. We need air, not greetings!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
He motions Michaels to precede him into the hatch. Face reflecting his irrational fear, Michaels puts his swim mask over his fear. But he freezes at the door, unable to step into the small hatch. Grant and Duval exchange looks.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go, Doctor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
Michaels forces himself into the Escape Hatch. Grant follows, closing the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ESCAPE HATCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is only space for the two. Michaels cowers against the wall, palms pressed against the metal, fighting against another seizure of his phobia. Grant opens a valve. Liquid starts pouring into the hatch from several ports. When it is up to their chins, Grant bends down to unlock the ventral hatch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PROTEUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grant drops out of the hatch. Michaels follows. Grant then closes the hatch. With Grant in the lead, they swim toward:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TOP OF PROTEUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grant reaches the snorkel, looks toward Bubble.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUBBLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Where Owens has now swiveled so that he faces the stern. Owens sees Grant signal to proceed. Owens presses button on SNORKEL RELEASE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PROTEUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The snorkel starts rising. When the tube is a few feet above the sub, Grant takes the bobbing end, holds it under one arm, and starts swimming with his free arm toward the Capillary Wall on the left.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SIDE OF PROTEUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Grant swims by with the end of the unreeling tube, Michaels joins him. Then Duval and Cora, who are now coming out of the ventral hatch. All swim to the nearby Capillary Wall. (NOTE: During the following, their action is complicated by the big Corpuscles flowing by in a steady stream, taking on oxygen and bumping into them.) They reach:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALVEOLAR CREVICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It shimmers with the liquid that seems to cover it like a door of reflecting glass. The opening is just large enough for all to look within. They see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ALVEOLUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A vast conical volcano, the upper part lost to view. Numerous outcroppings of immense crags are visible on all sides.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's full of rocks!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
(NOTE: During all Swimming Sequences, we will hear the Speaker's Voice via the AUDIO PICKUP within the swimming mask of the one who responds vocally.)
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAELS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In a way -- yes. Those are impurities imbedded in the Lung after a lifetime of 'Civilization.' Carbon from smoke and smog -- specks of dust --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAELS>
<GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, we better get on with it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
He starts shoving the front of the snorkel through the vertical liquid entrance. To his startled surprise, it immediately comes flying out with great force. Michaels and Duval grab it in time to prevent the snorkel from snaking off down the stream.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAELS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Careful! There is a tremendous air pressure in there -- in relation to our size!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAELS>
<DIRECTION>
Grant grabs hold or the front part again.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll try to hold it from the other side of the wall, while you push from out here. Maybe that'll do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<CORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't --it's too dangerous --
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORA>
<MICHAELS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes -- with all that pressure, and suction within --

	<DIALOGUE>
	There's no other way. Tie my safety line to the sub.

</GRANT>
<DUVAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here, let me have it.

<DIRECTION>
Grant takes out his safety line, hooks it onto his suit. Duval starts swimming with the other end back to the Proteus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUBBLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Owens is eyeing the pressure gauges anxiously. He reacts as he sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PROTEUS - P.O.V. BUBBLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With Owens we see Duval is nearing the sub, the safety line strung out behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PROTEUS - AT VENTRAL HATCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Duval hooks Grant's safety line onto a ring for the purpose, signals:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALVEOLUS CREVICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grant acknowledges signal. The Alveolar Wall can be seen dilating slightly.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right now -- push the snorkel through as soon as I get inside.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<MICHAELS>
<DIRECTION>
(eyes on Wall)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Walt for the lull -- between the time he inhales and exhales.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAELS>
<DIRECTION>
As the dilating stops:
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAELS>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAELS>
<DIRECTION>
Grant pushes quickly through the shimmering entrance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ALVEOLUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He has literally transposed himself into another element: air. There is no turbulence, no sound. Instantly he props his feet against both sides of the entrance. The snorkel is shoved through. As he grabs it and holds, a breath is heard starting. Only Grant can hear the ensuing sound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAPILLARY SIDE OF ALVEOLUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Duval now joins Michaels and Cora. They hold against the increasing pressure from within. Grant can be seen straining on the other side against the enormous wind pressure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUBBLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Owens' finger is on the button of the MASTER PRESSURE GAUGE, waiting. Tha indicator is quickly swinging toward FULL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ALVEOLUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wind is rising to gale force. Grant is holding on with all his strength to the end of the snorkel. The others can be seen pushing from their side, to keep the tube from flying out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MASTER PRESSURE GAUGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the indicator hits the FULL position:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AIR TANK CONTROL BUTTON

<DIRECTION>
Owens' finger presses down while:
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Full!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OWENS_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ALVEOLUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In response, Grant lets go of the snorkel, which is instantly whipped out. Buffeted by the howling wind, he now tries to get out. But the hurricane causes Grant to lose his balance. He falls, slammed against the outcroppings by the force of the wind. Finally the lull comes. Instantly, Grant starts climbing back, hand over hand, using the rope as one would in scaling a mountain. The crevice is still far up ahead when suddenly a new breath starts in the upward direction. Grant is caught in the tremendous suction of the exhalation and is pulled toward the interior of the Lung.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAFETY CLASP ON SUB RING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Safety Clasp breaks off at the end of the nylon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALVEOLUS CREVICE

<DIRECTION>
Michaels, Duval and Cora react as the line snakes past them through the crevice.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's gone!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORA>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ALVEOLUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The suction sends Grant flying upward, past the crevice, with the safety line trailing after him. The wind whips him toward a fantastic height. Finally he hits:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLUMNAR CILIA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Long stalks, with a waving motion that makes it resemble a vast field of wheat. Grant is seen flying through it, until he is lost from view. Then as the wind subsides:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALVEOLUS CREVICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The three are waiting, tense.
</DIRECTION>
<DUVAL>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DUVAL>
<MICHAELS>

	Nothing -- against all that force.

<CORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But we just can't leave him in there! What'll happen to him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORA>
<MICHAELS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll know -- in the next breath...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAELS>
<DIRECTION>
They react as they see the Alveolar Wall starting to dilate again, signaling the advent of another breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ALVEOLUS - SHOOTING UP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wind starts howling. And then Grant is seen at a vast height, plummeting down. Part of the way he hits a spongy area, bounces, is caught up again by the blasting wind, hits another spongy section, with a big outcropping of "rock."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OUTCROPPING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fighting the gale, he manages to snake his safety line around the big rock. As he hangs on, he sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
P.O.V. - PRINCIPALS AND SUB - THROUGH CREVICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Not too far above, with rocks between.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRANT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He waits it out until the howling tornado subsides. Then in the lull, he releases himself quickly and clambers toward the opening. He thrusts himself through the crevice, just as another breath begins.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALVEOLUS CREVICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The others grab him, pull him through all the way before he can be sucked back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CAPILLARY WALL - P.O.V. BUBBLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Owens is relieved to see the four start swimming back to the sub.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONTROL TOWER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carter is pacing in the heavy silence. Reid is watching the monitors. Carter glances at the Minute Recorder. It flashes to

Owens glances at the Repeater. The co-ordinates show the sub is traveling toward the apex of the Pleura, to the north, which is bounded by an undefined area simply marked "Lymphatic." A sense of absolute serenity seems to pervade. Abruptly:

She puts the transistor and wire down on the workbench and moves to open a medical kit. Duval takes the wire and places it between two small clamps on the workbench. Cora extracts a scalpel, gives it to him. Duval swings a magnifying glass over the strand as Cora trains a light on the wire. Duval bends over. Peering through the magnifying glass, he slowly begins to scrape the strand with the scalpel.

</DIRECTION>

As it courses easily through the sunny stream, to suddenly emerge into:

<DIRECTION>
EXT. LYMPHATIC NODE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A startlingly different world. The headbeams reveal what appears to be an underwater marshland: a tangle of reticular fibers which wave with the gentle cross currents seeping through the mesh. Weird bacterial forms drift by, moving in groups like raiding parties. The yellowish light of the Lymphatic Stream still filters through.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUBBLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Owens is forced to slow down as he carefully begins to thread his way through the tangle, trying not to brush against the tendrils. But for all of Owens' care, the nose of the sub breaks some fibers as it nudges through the increasingly narrow spaces of the brambly mesh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Grant reacts as he sees the broken fibers drift against the bow windows, and then become momentarily entangled around them. When the tendrils clear the windows, he looks back to the stern.

He breaks off as a big clump of fibers is torn loose, for all his skillful steering.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. UNDERSIDE OF SUB

The mass of tendrils drifts down the length of the underside. Part of the clump adheres to the ventral hatch, another section twines around the exhaust: In so doing, it snags on the brambles beneath.

Scalpel poised over the wire, Duval reacts as the Proteus momentarily jars while it pulls loose. He exchanges looks with Cora, who is holding the lamp.

EXT. LYMPHATIC NODE - BEGINNING OF BATTLE BETWEEN BACTERIA AND ANTIBODIES - P.O.V. PRINCIPALS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flashing reflected light from the headbeams, elongated crystalline structures with rod-like projections which make linkage possible, are whipping against the bow windows where they have trapped a mass of ferocious-looking large Bacteria. The smaller crystalline Anti-bodies are rapidly coupling with others that speed in to join the fray. The Bacteria fight back with their flagella, in a death struggle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIEW OF BATTLE FROM INT. BUBBLE
</DIRECTION>

Owens ducks involuntarily as the linking Antibodies and the Bacteria slam against the Bubble in such numbers and sizes as to make the way ahead virtually invisible. As a result, the sub tears through a clump of fibers like a scythe.

Duval appears in the doorway.

He breaks off as he sees the Antibodies and Bacteria whipping against the windows. Cora appears behind him, gasps at the sight of the monsters locked in battle.

</MICHAELS>
<DIRECTION>
BIG CLOSEUP - ONE ANTIBODY AND BACTERIUM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As both slam and hold against the bow windows in a life-and-death struggle. An amazing phenomenon is taking form: Antibodies are hooking up at the rods to completely encase the Bacterium -- and the geometric forms fit the antagonist .

Now the crystalline geometric links start pressing together with inexorable force. The Bacterium fights back with its flagella. Then suddenly it goes limp. As the destroyed Bacterium drifts off, another mass of virulent monsters smashes into the windows and are instantly embattled with a swarm of Antibodies that come linking up. Now the SOUND of the battle can be heard along the entire length of the sub. Meanwhile, the sub is jarred hard, as it breaks through another clump of entangling fibers. The sound and sight of the mortal battle increases in intensity, as does the forced passage during:

WITH CORA - DOWN THE CHASM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is thrust over the curved edge, starts falling head down. She narrowly misses the first connective conduit. Then her Breather Pack snags on one of the strands of the next conduit, which flings her partially to one side so that her legs are caught between the other strands. As she hangs head down, the weight of her body causing the strands -- and herself -- to be whipped back and forth, she is further terrifled to see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LONG SHOT - CHASM - CORA'S P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All the quadruple strands are vibratlng in the seemingly bottomless abyss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO CORA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she tries to extricate herself, which causes her to be "vibrated" with even greater intensity:
</DIRECTION>
<CORA>

(screaming)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORA>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COCHLEAR DUCT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the distance, the Proteus is being brought under control. Michaels and Grant are in view, swimming against the force set off by the diminishing vibrations in this part of the Ear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRANT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He hears:
</DIRECTION>
<CORA_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(barely audible: over audio)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</CORA_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Grant looks about. There is no sign of her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CORA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Struggling head down, in terror, she hears:
</DIRECTION>
<GRANT_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cora! Where are you?

Michaels swims up to Grant.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANT>

</GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
As Michaels points, Grant hears:
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAELS_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(over audio)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right down there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAELS_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
They both swim off in the indicated direction, reach:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. EDGE OF CHASM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Both look down. At first they don't see her. Then Grant spots Cora. He points for Michaels' benefit. They see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CORA IN CHASM - THEIR P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Far below, still trying to struggle loose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CORA IN CHASM

<DIRECTION>
As she hears:

<DIRECTION>
(on audio)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay! I can see you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
She stops struggling. But unseen by her, the vibrating strands in which she is entangled have called forth, in apparent response:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FEW ANTIBODIES - IN CHASM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Appearing from the far side, and below Cora. They start moving toward her. More Antibodies instantly appear from the same area.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. EDGE OF CHASM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grant and Michaels are swimming over the curved mosaic cells.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE CHASM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grant and Michaels swim down toward Cora on the strands. Now the Antibodies become visible, gathering in increasing numbers as they stream up toward Cora. They are as yet unlinked, but she is unmistakably their target.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAELS>
<DIRECTION>
(startled)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Antibodies!... Coming at Cora! She's triggered them off!

From her head-down position, she sees:

Michaels starts swimming fast as he can toward the Proteus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CHASM - GRANT, CORA AND ANTIBODIES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is racing to reach Cora before they do.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE AUDITORY STRANDS - IN CHASM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From her head-down position, Cora sees vast numbers of: Antibodies, now nearer. Frantic with fear, she tries to free herself, causing the strands to start vibrating again, which calls forth more Antibodies to stream out of the far side. Grant reaches her, starts working desperately to get her loose. She tries to help as he yanks at her Breather Pack, trying to work it off the wires.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PROTEUS - COCHLEAR DUCT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Near the edge of the chasm. Duval is seen at the bow windows, looking out anxiously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PROTEUS

<DIRECTION>
Duval turns as the door of the Escape Hatch opens from within and Michaels steps out. He closes the door quickly. The light over it instantly flashes red.
</DIRECTION>
<DUVAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are they?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUVAL>
<DIRECTION>
As Michaels pulls off his swimming mask, breathing hard:
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAELS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Below the Cells of Hensen. If those Antibodies reach her, they'll attack as if she were bacteria...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAELS>

He is still trying to get her Breather Pack loose.

<CORA>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hurry! Oh please, please!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORA>
<DIRECTION>
He manages to get her pack loose, now starts pulling the strands apart at her ankles so that she can extricate herself. As she finally does, they execute a half-somersault in the stream to start swimming upward. Both get a fleeting look at:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LONG SHOT - ANTIBODIES - P.O.V. GRANT AND CORA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The links have now formed chains the of Cora.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grant grabs her at the torso and starts to propel her upward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LONG SHOT - CHASM - ANTIBODIES AND PRINCIPALS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The long links, in vast numbers, now race after the frantically swimming Cora and Grant.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. EDGE OF CHASM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grant and Cora appear, swim over the slippery edge of the mosaic cells. She is too exhausted to keep up the pace. Grant holds her with one arm as he keeps swimming toward:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PROTEUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Duval and Michaels can be seen at the bow windows, looking out. Owens is visible within the Bubble, peering out anxiously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. VENTRAL HATCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two reach it, Grant still helping Cora. They are at the point of exhaustion. Grant reacts as he sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LIGHT OVER VENTRAL HATCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flashing red.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. VENTRAL HATCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grant waits, hand at the wheel. Cora looks back toward the edge of the chasm for signs of the Antibodies.
</DIRECTION>
<CORA>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Open it! Open it before they get here!

</CORA>
<GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't till the hatch is flooded!

</GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
At her look of fright, he turns and sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANTIBODIES - EDGE OF CHASM - P.O.V. CORA AND GRANT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The long links catapult over the edge of the chasm like Polaris missiles in flight, then begin to execute a turn for a massed attack in the direction of:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. VENTRAL HATCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The light flashes green. Grant begins turning the wheel quickly as he can.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERCUT ANTIBODIES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hurtling down toward Cora, and the wheel turning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. VENTRAL HATCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just as the door drops down, the vanguard of the Anti-bodies reaches Cora. Two coils whip transversely around her shoulders. There is no time to tear them off. Grant thrusts Cora through the door, then follows, with the massed attackers streaming in after them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ESCAPE HATCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cora is clawing at the Antibodies which are coiling around her from every direction. For the moment, Grant can't help her as he struggles to close the door against:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANTIBODIES AT VENTRAL DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crystalline links are forcing their way in, against the pressure of the closing door. Grant struggles with all his strength against the coiling mass. Finally he manages to get the door closed and locked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ESCAPE HATCH - GRANT, CORA AND ANTIBODIES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The water level starts falling, accompanied by the hissing of air pressure. Grant and Cora try to claw at the crystalline structures. But in the extremely narrow confines of the chamber, there is little either can do. Suddenly Cora's expression changes to one of horror and pain.
</DIRECTION>
<CORA>
<DIRECTION>
(gasping)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're tightening...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORA>
<DIRECTION>
Desperately, Grant tries to get at least one coil loose, but to no avail. The crystalline structures are now constricting around her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PROTEUS

Duval and Michaels stand before the Escape Hatch, waiting for the red light to change to green.

He starts to twist the wheel, to open the Hatch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ESCAPE HATCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The water is now down to their knees. Grant is still pulling at one of the many links around Cora, but without any effect.
</DIRECTION>
<CORA>
<DIRECTION>
(barely audible)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please -- I -- can't -- can't breathe...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORA>
<DIRECTION>
And she is cut off as all the Antibodies lock into place. Her mouth remains open, in the manner of someone being choked to death. The crystalline coils about her body give her the appearance of a female Laocoon... Suddenly the entrance door is thrust open behind them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PROTEUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Water pours out from the Escape hatch as Grant drags Cora out. She falls on the floor. Duval and Michaels instantly start pulling at the Antibodies. Cora is almost unconscious. Grant joins in the frantic effort to free her. And then Owens, who comes bounding down from the Bubble. All four men pull at the structures with all their strength. And suddenly they begin to break off, shattering into crystalline fragments. With some coils broken, the others soon lose their lethal adhesion. Finally Cora is free. As soon as she finds her breath, she begins to cry hysterically. Duval bends over, calming her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OPERATING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All are still immoblle, sweating out the long wait. The Female Surgical Aide who caused the scissors to drop stands holding the towel. The scissors is still on the floor at her feet. In the silence, she carefully reaches out and dabs at the rivulets of sweat running down the Head Surgeon's face. Now all are concentrating on the:
</DIRECTION>

Moving silently back and forth across Benes' head, the only contact with what is transpiring within.

Reid is looking down into the OPERATING ROOM, Carter is pouring two fresh cups of coffee. At the SOUND of a warning buzz, both look at the TV monitor. They see the INTERIOR OF THE TRACKING POST. The blip is moving on the radar screen.

Michaels is spreading out a chart of the Brain, with the help of Duval. As the complexity comes into view, Grant reacts. With glance at the Minute Recorder:

Suddenly, light pours in. Astonished, Grant sees:

Semi-transparent. The immense pillars which form the Stapes of the Inner Ear are illuminated by the light behind it.

	Oh, no. Plenty of cause. He won't follow the herd, or change his convictions -- even when they're not popular. And he believes in an absolutely free interchange of information between scientists of different countries -- and these days, there's nothing more suspicious than that.

They turn toward bow, see:

<DIRECTION>
EXT. FOREST OF DENDRITES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As it comes into view with the sub turning the corner of the chasm: a huge semi-circular area of branchlike nerves, through which the cerebral lights flash. In the center is the site of the injury. The lights stop at its perimeter, as if short-circuited, causing a dark area.
</DIRECTION>
<DUVAL>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There it is. That's the site of the injury -- the dark spot. We'd better get prepared.

They move into the Lab Section, where they put on their Breather Packs quickly during:

Startled, they follow his look, see the Minute Recorder now reads

He begins to spread out a map of the Removal Area.

<DUVAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Removal Point? What're you talking about!

Grant moves quickly to the Manual Panel and throws some key switches into the OFF position.

INT. BUBBLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Owens is startled to see the lights over the buttons go off, rendering the controls inoperative. The sub comes to a stop at some distance from the Forest of Dendrites and the dark area up ahead.

With manner of taking over:
</DIRECTION>
<GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get the laser, Dr. Duval.

</GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
As Duval and Cora move quickly into the Lab Section:
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAELS>
<DIRECTION>
(furiously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm in charge of this mission! You were instructed to take orders from me, not give them!

</MICHAELS>
<GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, but the situation has changed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<MICHAELS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing has changed as far as authority goes! He is going to operate! Not in the little time we have left! There's no chance of success! It's sheer suicide for all of us!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAELS>
<DIRECTION>
He breaks off as Duval and Cora come out of the Lab Section carrying the laser and power unit. As they move to the Escape Hatch door, which Grant opens:
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAELS>
<DIRECTION>
(furiously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Duval, you are not going through with this! I absolutely forbid it! I'm responsible for the lives of everyone here! I will not allow you or anyone else to leave this ship!

<DUVAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to do what I can to save Benes.

He steps into the Escape Hatch with Cora. Grant closes the door.

<MICHAELS>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You fool! Don't you see what you've done? You've given him a perfect opportunity to kill Benes!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAELS>
<DIRECTION>
The lights start flashing red, indicating the Escape Hatch is being flooded. Grant puts on his Breather Pack during:
</DIRECTION>
<GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't believe that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<MICHAELS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not? Because of his gibberish about GOd and the Soul? Camouflage -- that's all it is -- to blind the gullible like you! And to hide his real identity -- a fanatic whose only purpose is to kill Benes! And you made it possible!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAELS>
<DIRECTION>
The light over the Escape Hatch turns green. As Grant opens the door:
</DIRECTION>
<GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've come up against fanatics before, and Duval just doesn't fit the pattern.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(up at Bubble)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going out there, Skipper. Maybe I can be of some help...

</GRANT>
<OWENS>

As Grant starts closing the door, he glances at:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MINUTE RECORDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It now reads

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PROTEUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grant closes the door. The light over it flashes red. Michaels moves to the bow window to observe:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SITE OF INJURY - P.O.V. MICHAELS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Duval and Cora are swimming toward the dark spot with the laser and the power unit. They reach:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SITE OF INJURY - CLOSER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Duval presses the laser control, not knowing if it will work. To his relief, a beam of light shoots out. Instantly a small portion of the clot begins to light up. This gradual encroachment of flashing lights in place of the dark area marks the progress of the operation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. VENTRAL HATCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grant drops out and starts toward Duval and Cora.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SECTION OF THROMBUS IN BRAIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The laser beam is slowly dissolving away a small portion of the vast darkness. Grant swims up. He glances at his wrist watch.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How does it look, Doctor?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<DUVAL>
<DIRECTION>
(as he works)

	If I can relieve the pressure on a few key vessels...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUVAL>
<DIRECTION>
More of the dark area lights up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PROTEUS - AT BOW WINDOWS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watching, Michaels responds grimly to the increasing number of flashing lights in the injured area. He turns with grim resolution from the bow.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Skipper...

INT. BUBBLE

Owens is startled to hear:
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAELS_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(from below)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There seems to be something wrong with the Escape Hatch...

</OWENS>
<MICHAELS_VOICE>

(from below; imperatively)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fluid is seeping through. Better come down and have a look!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAELS_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Quickly, Owens starts slipping out of his harness, starts down the ladder leading into:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PROTEUS - AT ESCAPE HATCH DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michaels is not visible in the angle of the shot as Owens moves to the Escape Hatch, looking for the seepage. Seeing nothing wrong:
</DIRECTION>
<OWENS>
<DIRECTION>
(turning; puzzled)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't see any sign of --

</OWENS>
<DIRECTION>
He breaks off, his expression reflecting horrified surprise as a hand wielding the heavy crank of the winch smashes down on his head before he has a chance to dodge it. Owens slumps to the floor at the feet of:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAELS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He drops the heavy tool, goes quickly to the Manual Panel, throws the switches back into the ON position, restoring all the controls to where they were before Grant changed them. Then he climbs up into:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUBBLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lights over the buttons are all on again, indicating the controls are in working order. As Michaels sits down hastily and begins to slip into the harness, with him we see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SITE OF INJURY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Duval is aiming the laser in short bursts at a dark area around the large Central Nerve. Grant glances at his wrist watch.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doctor, we've just about had it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<DUVAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It I can clear this Central Nerve, that be enough...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUVAL>
<DIRECTION>
Unseen by them:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LONG SHOT - PROTEUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the distance it is swinging around in a wide arc them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUBBLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Michaels maneuvers into position, he responds grimly to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SITE OF INJURY - P.O.V. INT. BUBBLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Light begins to play along sections of the Central Nerve.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUBBLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bow is now lined up straight with the Central Nerve. Face set, Michaels presses the FULL SPEED button.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JETS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The churning indicates full power is on. The Proteus spurts ahead, speeding toward:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SITE OF INJURY - CENTRAL NERVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
More and more of the Central Nerve lights up as the intervening darkness is dissolved by precise bursts of the laser beam. Unaware of the oncoming sub, Duval and Cora keep working. As Grant glances at his wrist watch, electrical impulses begin racing in a continuous flow through the Central Nerve, which is now incandescent along its entire height.
</DIRECTION>
<DUVAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That should be enough...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUVAL>
<DIRECTION>
He looks critically at the results, as he normally would.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We better get back to the sub. Every second counts now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<CORA>
<DIRECTION>
(suddenly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look! They follow the direction of her glance, are startled to see:
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORA>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PROTEUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Speeding directly toward the Central Nerve high above them. The person in the Bubble is indeterminate at the distance and angle.
</DIRECTION>
<CORA_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(o.s.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's heading right for the Nerve!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORA_S_VOICE>
<DUVAL_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(o.s., confused)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't understand...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUVAL_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SITE OF INJURY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they watch helplessly:
</DIRECTION>
<GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
(getting idea)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The laser! Let me have the laser!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
Grant grabs the laser from Duval. With Cora trailing, holding the power unit, Grant leads the way upward at an angle to intercept:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PROTEUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is speeding toward the Central Nerve like a projectile homing in on a target.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUBBLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The incandescent Central Nerve looms closer and closer. Michaels holds the controls in place with the fixed look of a pilot on a suicide course.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRANT, CORA AND PROTEUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stops swimming. She remains near him. The sub is now over their heads, at an angle which makes the rudder visible.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give me your widest beam! Full power!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
Cora turns a dial on the power unit. Grant takes careful aim. A wide beam shoots out from the laser, across the intervening distance and hits:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RUDDER AND REAR HULL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The concentrated light disintegrates the rudder and burns open a large section of the hull.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LAB SECTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fluid pours through the hole into:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PROTEUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The intact section with its trapped air holds off total inundation. The unconscious Owens stirs, face up, the liquid just short of covering him. The sub begins to keel, owing to the inflow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BVBBLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michaels wrestles with the controls, trying to keep on course, as the Central Nerve ahead looms closer and closer. For a moment it appears he will be able to ram it. But the increasing tilt suddenly causes:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PROTEUS - CENTRAL NERVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
To dive at a sharp angle, just barely missing the Central Nerve.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUBBLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michaels wrestles with the controls, but to no avail. Through the Bubble, he is startled to see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FOREST OF DENDRITES - P.O.V. BUBBLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It looms closer and closer as the Proteus dives inexorably toward:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FOREST OF DENDRITES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Treelike branching nerves form an intricate mesh as if in a dense forest. The Proteus careens into it, tearing loose a section of nerve fibers. The sub keels over on one side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUBBLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now at a sharp tilt. The impact causes one of the arms of the swivel chair to spring out of place, pinning Michaels to the seat. Lying at an angle, he struggles to break loose, without avail. Suddenly his startled eyes fix on:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE MINUTE RECORDER ON CONTROL PANEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It flashes
<0>. The lights begin to dim.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONTROL TOWER - MINUTE RECORDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flashing
<0>. The SOUND of a warning siren is on loud. It continues during the scene, adding urgency to the reactions of all. Reid and Carter exchange grim looks.

<REID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Time's up... We'll have to take them out immediately.
	</DIALOGUE>

<CARTER>

<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn it to hell!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<DIRECTION>
He turns away. Reid goes to the window overlooking the OPERATING R00M.
</DIRECTION>
<REID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Remove the Proteus...

</REID>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OPERATING ROOM

For a moment only the undulating wail of the warning siren is heard. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<CHIEF_SURGEON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Prepare for trepanation...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHIEF_SURGEON>
<DIRECTION>
One of the Surgical Technicians begins swabbing Benes' head with alcohol.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUBBLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lights are almost out. It is now lit only by the eerie glow of the pulsing flashes in the Forest of Dendrites. Michaels is vainly trying to pry the steel arm loose, but it holds him in a vise-like grip in the chair. He looks fearfully toward the bow window, as if knowing what to expect next.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. EDGE OF FOREST OF DENDRITES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grant, Duval and Cora are swimming through the maze of nerves toward the sub lying at a sharp keel.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The ship's good as finished. We'll have to get out on our own! Is there a quick way out?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<DUVAL>

EXT. PROTEUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Growing visibly before their eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUBBLE

Michaels reacts as he sees the dendrites outside growing , which indicates the sub and he are growing larger.

<DUVAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've got to get them out.

As he starts toward the sub, Grant stops him.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
They follow his look, see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHITE CORPUSCLES - IN FOREST OF DENDRITES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Huge monster-like blobs are starting to ooze through the nerves toward the Proteus, which is now about a quarter as large as when last seen, and growing rapidly.
</DIRECTION>
<CORA_S_VOICE>

<GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay here, both of you. Hold them off, if you can.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
He hands the laser to Duval and starts swimming toward:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PROTEUS - IN FOREST OF DENDRITES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The White Corpuscles are slithering through the interlaced dendrites. They are still some distance from the disabled sub.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAELS - IN BUBBLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is horrified to see the White Corpuscles slide into his view, though still removed from the sub. He renews his frantic effort to break loose from the steel grip of the sprung arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DAMAGED HULL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grant swims the hole through into:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LAB AND STORAGE SECTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quickly he makes his way through the narrow flooded area, picking up two Breather Packs en route.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PROTEUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grant emerges into the air-filled portion, pushes up his swim mask. He takes in the prone Owens and Michaels pinned in the Bubble as:
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAELS>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grant! Help!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAELS>

For a moment Grant stands between the unconscious man and the one trapped in the Bubble. Then he hurriedly unzips Owens' jumper, revealing the swim suit beneath. Owens regains consciousness. During the above:

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grant!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAELS_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUBBLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A monster-like cell is slithering toward the Bubble. Michaels is tearing at the steel arm that holds him to the chair.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAELS>
<DIRECTION>
(with growing terror)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Macrophages!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAELS>
<DIRECTION>
Moving against the extreme tilt, Grant appears. Responding to the oncoming White Corpuscle, Grant pulls at the steel arm with all his strength.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAELS>
<DIRECTION>
(during above)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get me out of here. Get me out!!

For all his effort, Grant is unable to free Michaels.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHITE CORPUSCLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gradually oozes over the entire Bubble, covering it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUBBLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grant makes a last desperate effort to free Michaels as he sees the Bubble begin to dissolve beneath the body of the adhering White Corpuscle. As the fluid body begins flowing over Michaels:

<MICHAELS>
<DIRECTION>
(in terror)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No...no...

His scream is cut off by the White Corpuscle engulfing him. Grant jumps back into:

Both pull down their swim masks. Owens moves off, followed by Grant.

INT. LAB SECTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Owens is swimming through the hole. Grant follows through the cramped area.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PROTEUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Owens appears, swims off toward Duval and Cora. The two are working the laser and power unit. Duval is hitting the White Corpuscles and dissolving them in an attempt to keep them off the sub, but without avail. The monster cells are swarming in greater numbers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DAMAGED RUDDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A monster White Corpuscle is flowing along it, down toward the hole. As Grant now emerges, the White Corpuscle grasps him in its tentacles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRANT AND WHITE CORPUSCLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He struggles, unable to break out of the fluid mass which engulfs him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. EDGE OF FOREST OF DENDRITES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Duval and Cora swim up. Duval aims the laser, presses the trigger. The beam shoots out with surgical precision, making a direct hit on:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VACUOLE OF WHITE CORPUSCLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The nucleus of the monster cell disintegrates, releasing Grant. He swims quickly toward:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FOREST OF DENDRITES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The three see another White Corpuscle moving after Grant. Duval dissolves it just as the laser goes dead. As Grant reaches them:

</DUVAL>
<GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>

Duval drops the laser, turns and starts to swim off. Cora drops the power unit. With Duval in the lead, they swim as fast as they can through:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FOREST OF DENDRITES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dendrites are now in relat1on to the four as they keep on through the Cranial Region of flashing lights.

White Corpuscles are now festooned all over the sub and flowing in through the Bubble and damaged portion of the hull.

It is crumbling like the Hindenburg Zeppelin. The White Corpuscles are swarming over the remains, ingesting every particle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE GROUP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reacting to the destructive power of these internal defenders. They swim off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OPERATING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Chief Surgeon's gloves are on. Now all start to take their places around the Operating Table. The operating beams are switched on. The Chief Surgeon holds out one hand. A Surgical Nurse slaps a scalpel into it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONTROL TOWER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standing at the window overlooking the OPERATING ROOM, Carter and Reid can see the Chief Surgeon bending down over Benes' head, about to make an incision. Carter suddenly gets an idea, presses button.
</DIRECTION>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold it, Doctor!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<DIRECTION>
BENES' HEAD AND SCALPEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cutting edge is a fraction of an inch from the shaved head. It stops just in time. The Chief Surgeon and the Surgical Team around the table look up toward the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONTROL TOWER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reid looks tensely at Carter.
</DIRECTION>
<REID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REID>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That blip we're picking up might only be the radio-active particle. The Proteus may already be destroyed...

</CARTER>
<REID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What're you getting at?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REID>
<CARTER>
<DIRECTION>
(thoughtfully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I were in their place and I'd run out of time, I'd abandon the ship before I grew to dangerous size... and use the few extra minutes to get out the quickest way possible, on my own...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<REID>
<DIRECTION>
(with quick realization)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Along the Optic Nerve to the Eye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REID>
<DIRECTION>
Swiftly, Reid crosses to the window overlooking the OPERATING ROOM. He presses button.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OPERATING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Chief Surgeon and the others exchange tense looks as they hear:
</DIRECTION>
<REID_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(o.s.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait thirty seconds...
	</DIALOGUE>
</REID_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
He rushes through the door leading down to the Operating Room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ARACHNOID CORRIDOR - RIGHT OPTIC NERVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Composed of a cobweb of fibers. Sausage-like links, pinched in the center, compose the walls of the winding passage. These are the Nodes of Ranvier. Intermittent flashes leap across the Nodes, of varying intensity and duration.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE GROUP - IN RIGHT OPTIC NERVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he keeps swimming, Duval turns his head to the others.
</DIRECTION>
<DUVAL>
<DIRECTION>
(encouragingly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Light impulses -- on the way to the Brain! We're nearing the Eye!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUVAL>
<DIRECTION>
They swim on with renewed effort. They are now larger in relation to what they pass. Cora starts to fall behind, unable to maintain the pace, for all her valiant effort. Grant puts one arm around her waist and thus manages to keep after Duval and Owens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. APEX OF CORNEA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The four climb up on what appears to be the top of a huge transparent mound. The fluid is rapidly seeping upward from the channel below. A low-domed ceiling -- the inside of the Eyelid -- which is bisected by a crack, necessitates their crawling over the mound toward a crevice which affords more height. They force themselves along exhausted, and reach:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CREVICE BETWEEN EYELIDS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The four reach the grotto-like niche, where they can stand erect at their increased size. As they rise from their crawling position and lean panting in exhaustion against the wall:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OPERATING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reid wheels over a magnifying glass mounted on a stand. He bends down and pries open Benes' right Eyelid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CREVICE BETWEEN RIGHT EYELIDS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The four, their breath now regained, react in response to the unexpected:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PARTING OF RIGHT EYELIDS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bisected dome above them parts like the walls of the Red Sea. Simultaneously the beam of the operating lights blaze in with blinding intensity, causing the four to shield their eyes and look down into the retina.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KALEIDOSCOPIC EFFECT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A symphony of colors is reflecting from the cones far beneath, through the VITREOUS BODY and the manifold furrows of the IRIS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REID
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is bringing the magnifying glass into focal position. As he squints through it, he reacts on seeing:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FOUR - THROUGH MAGNIFYING GLASS - ON SURFACE OF EYEBALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now magnified, we see the four figures being swept inexorably toward the far corner of the Eye by a flood of water.
</DIRECTION>
<REID>
<DIRECTION>
(o.s.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A glass slide! Quick!
	</DIALOGUE>
</REID>
<DIRECTION>
Through the magnifying glass, we see their frantic attempts to fight the sweep of the cascade. Just as the four near the fall-off point, where the corner of the lids Join, the magnified end of a glass slide comes into view and catches the teardrop -- with the four in it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OPERATING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reid carefully straightens up, holding the glass slide. He can barely see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GLASS SLIDE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tiny specks are visible in the teardrop, moving about in the fluid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OPERATING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All respond to Reid's imperative:
</DIRECTION>
<REID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Open those doors!
	</DIALOGUE>
</REID>
<DIRECTION>
Holding the slide so the teardrop doesn't spill, Reid moves quickly through the sliding doors into the Miniaturization Room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONTROL TOWER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carter rushes to the window overlooking the MINIATURIZATION ROOM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MINIATURIZATION ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All group around in silence, holding their breath as Reid very slowly and carefully bends down and places the glass slide on the platform. Above, at the window, Carter can be seen looking down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GLASS SLIDE - ON FLOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tiny spots are growing visibly before our eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONTROL TOWER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carter, looking down into the MINIATURIZATION ROOM, reacts as the four dots below on the glass slide continue to grow and grow to the point where they can be discerned on the platform, and a bedraggled quartet it is. They look like survivors of a shipwreck: dripping wet, exhausted, all the fight knocked out of them. Owens is seated, head between his drawn-up knees; Cora is leaning against Grant for support; Duval is fighting for breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MINIATURIZATION ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now fully grown, the four look about, amazed at where they are. And the Surgical Team and Reid encircling them are staring with equal confoundment...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CORRIDOR - HOSPITAL SECTION - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grant and Owens are driving a scooter. Both are rested, freshly groomed. The scooter goes through door marked:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The scooter stops in:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MEDICAL FOYER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They alight and go through door leading into:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Grant and Owens enter, they see Benes is propped up on his bed, with Carter, Duval, Cora and Reid grouped around him. Grant moves immediately to Benes.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
(warmly; extending hand)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Mr. Benes... How's the prize patient?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
Benes smiles as they shake hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DUVAL>

(beaming)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's making a fine recovery.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUVAL>
<CORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He certainly is. He should be up and about in no time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORA>
<OWENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's great.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OWENS>
<DIRECTION>
Grant and Owens look toward Carter, who is pacing, visibly upset.
</DIRECTION>
<CARTER>
<DIRECTION>
(answering their look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yes, great. The only problem is, he can't remember what he came to tell us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't remember?... What do you mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's blanked out on that one particular point.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<REID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, he can remember everything -- except how to control De- Miniaturization...
	</DIALOGUE>
</REID>
<GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, no.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<OWENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	After all that.

</OWENS>
<DUVAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A specific area of memory may have been destroyed by the laser beam when Dr. Michaels interfered.

</DUVAL>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As long as it isn't a certainty, we've got to try everything possible to make him remember!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<OWENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, if you have no further need for me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</OWENS>
<GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, we'd like to get moving.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<CARTER>
<DIRECTION>
(mind only on Benes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you go on. We'll meet you at the Clearance Desk in a few minutes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<DIRECTION>
He paces, looking at Benes while:
</DIRECTION>
<GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good-bye, Mr. Benes. I must say it's been quite an experience knowing you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
Benes smiles weakly at the double-entendre. As Grant starts out with Owens:
</DIRECTION>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now how soon can we try Sodium Pentathol?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<REID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd hold that off awhile.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REID>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, how about hypnosis? That can't hurt him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<DIRECTION>
Benes closes his eyes wearily.
</DIRECTION>
<DUVAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I suggest the first thing we try is letting the patient get some rest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUVAL>
<DIRECTION>
As he starts herding them out and they reach the door, they are startled by a loud CRASH o.s. They rush out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO SCOOTERS - AT INTERSECTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another scooter has run into the one containing Grant and Owens with such impact that the two have been tossed out. The M.P. is blowing his whistle, stopping all traffic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE GROUP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carter, Reid, Duval and Cora are running toward:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE INTERSECTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grant is rising, holding the side of his head. Owens, dazed but uninjured, is also getting up. As the others reach them:
</DIRECTION>
<DUVAL>
<DIRECTION>
(of Grant)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He may have a head injury!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Reid)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get him to the hospital!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUVAL>
<DIRECTION>
Instantly, Grant grabs Owens and hustles him to their scooter.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who, me? Oh, no! Don't bother about me! We're not hurt! Isn't that right, Skipper?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<OWENS>
<DIRECTION>
(dazed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh -- what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OWENS>
<GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
(getting him into scooter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We feel great, don't we? Just ?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<OWENS>
<DIRECTION>
(catching on)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh -- sure, sure! Never better!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OWENS>
<GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
(taking off)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing wrong with us! Not a thing! We're fine -- just fine!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
In his haste, he almost runs into another scooter but averts a crash by a matter of inches. He keeps going at top speed, by-passing the stopped traffic by traveling in the wrong lane.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LONG SHOT - SCOOTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As it is lost to view down the long corridor...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
