	Mrs. Otto, there is no such thing as an accident. The word doesn't mean anything to me. As far as I'm concerned, somebody somewhere made a decision to cut a corner. Some corrupt agency or corporation accounted the cost variance between a ten-cent bolt and a million dollar out-of-court settlement. They decided to sacrifice a few lives for the difference.

I said I didn't think I could do it. 'If her throat closes up and stops her breathing, you'll have to, Mr. Stephens. You'll have a minute and a half, two minutes maybe, and she'll probably be unconscious when you do it. But if you can keep her calm and relaxed, if you don't let her little heart beat too fast and spread the poison around, then you might just make it over here first.

	Abbott said that the true jury of a person's peers is the people of her town. Only they, the people who have known her all her life, and not twelve strangers, can decide her guilt or innocence. And if I have committed a crime, then it's a crime against them, so they are the ones who must decide my punishment.

	Well, Nicole, I've been wanting to meet you for a long time now. Not just because I've heard so many good things about you, but because, as you know, I'm the guy representing you and your mom and dad and some other folks here in town. We're trying to generate some compensation, however meager, for what you have suffered, and at the same time see that an accident like this never happens again. You're central to the case I'm trying to build, Nicole. But you'd probably just as soon let the whole thing lie. Just get on with your life as quickly and smoothly as possible.

	Now on that morning, did there come a time, Nicole, when you left your parents' house?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHWARTZ>
<NICOLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICOLE>
<SCHWARTZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What time in the morning was this?

</SCHWARTZ>
<NICOLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	About eight-thirty in the morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICOLE>
<SCHWARTZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was anyone waiting for the bus with you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHWARTZ>
<NICOLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I was alone. My sister Jenny was sick and stayed home that day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICOLE>
<SCHWARTZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was there anything unusual about the driver, Dolores Driscoll, or the bus that particular morning?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHWARTZ>
<NICOLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like what? I mean, I don't remember a lot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICOLE>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON MITCHELL
</DIRECTION>
<MITCHELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I object to the form of that question. Note that.

<SCHWARTZ>

	Was the bus on time?

</SCHWARTZ>
<NICOLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICOLE>
<SCHWARTZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And where did you sit that morning?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHWARTZ>
<NICOLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My usual place. On the right side. The first seat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICOLE>
<SCHWARTZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And according to your recollection, there was nothing unusual about the drive that morning?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHWARTZ>
<NICOLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Until the accident? No.

Worried about this new information.
</DIRECTION>
<NICOLE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was when Sean Walker got on. He was crying and didn't want to leave his mother. Mason Ansel was sitting beside me. I asked him to move, so I could quiet Sean down. When the bus started up, a car came around
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICOLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	the corner and almost hit Sean's mother. She was okay, but it really scared Sean, because he watched it out the window.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SCHWARTZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And was this incident caused in any way by anything the driver of the bus did?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHWARTZ>
<DIRECTION>
Pause. MITCHELL is nervous.
</DIRECTION>
<NICOLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, she hadn't even started to move the bus. It was the car's fault.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICOLE>
<DIRECTION>
MITCHELL is relieved.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHWARTZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There was nothing reckless in Mrs. Driscoll's behavior?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHWARTZ>
<MITCHELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I object to that form of question. Note that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MITCHELL>
<NICOLE>
<DIRECTION>
(answering the question)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICOLE>
<SCHWARTZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did there come a time when all the children had been picked up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHWARTZ>
<NICOLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICOLE>
<SCHWARTZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You remember that much?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHWARTZ>
<NICOLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As I'm talking, I'm remembering more about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICOLE>
<DIRECTION>
MITCHELL is worried.
</DIRECTION>
<MITCHELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Note my objection. She said, 'As I'm talking.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</MITCHELL>
<SCHWARTZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did there come a time when the bus turned off Staples Mill Road onto
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHWARTZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	the Marlowe Road at what's called Wilmot Springs?
	</DIALOGUE>
<NICOLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICOLE>
<NICOLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There was a brown dog that ran across the road up there, right by the dump, and Dolores slowed down not to hit him, and he ran into the woods. And then Dolores drove on and turned onto the Marlowe road, as usual. I remember that. I'm remembering it pretty clearly.

	And what was the weather like at this time?

</SCHWARTZ>
<NICOLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was snowing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICOLE>
<MITCHELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Unless the report from the National Weather Bureau for the district on January 23 goes into the record, I will object to that question.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MITCHELL>
<SCHWARTZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will offer that report. Well, then, now that your memory seems to be clearing, can you tell us what else you observed at that time?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHWARTZ>
<NICOLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Before the actual accident?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICOLE>
<SCHWARTZ>

NICOLE stares at her father as she responds.

<SCHWARTZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why were you scared?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHWARTZ>
<SCHWARTZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is before the accident, Nicole. Do you understand what I'm asking?

</SCHWARTZ>
<NICOLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I understand.

Silence. MITCHELL is watching his entire case crumble.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHWARTZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mrs. Driscoll was driving too fast? What made you think that, Nicole?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHWARTZ>
<NICOLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The speedometer. And it was downhill there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICOLE>
<SCHWARTZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You could see the speedometer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHWARTZ>
<NICOLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. I looked. I remember clearly now. It seemed we were going too fast down the hill. I was scared.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICOLE>
<DIRECTION>
NICOLE looks at MITCHELL, who stares back.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHWARTZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How fast would you say Mrs. Driscoll was going? To the best of your recollection?

</SCHWARTZ>
<NICOLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seventy-two miles an hour.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICOLE>
<SCHWARTZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seventy-two miles an hour? You're sure of this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHWARTZ>
<NICOLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Positive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICOLE>
<SCHWARTZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You believe that the bus driven by Mrs. Driscoll was going at seventy- two miles an hour at this time?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHWARTZ>
<NICOLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you I was positive. The speedometer was large and easy to see from where I was.
	</DIALOGUE>

The speedometer from NICOLE'S P.O.V. It reads fifty-one miles an hour.

<SCHWARTZ>

<SCHWARTZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There wasn't time?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHWARTZ>
<NICOLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Because the bus went off the road. And crashed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICOLE>
<SCHWARTZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You remember this?

<SCHWARTZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you remember about the accident?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHWARTZ>
<NICOLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I remember the bus swerved, it just suddenly swerved to the right, and it hit the guardrail and the snowbank on the side of the road, and then it went over the embankment there, and everyone was screaming and everything. And that's all. I guess I was unconscious after that. That's all. Then I was in the hospital.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICOLE>
<DIRECTION>
SCHWARTZ smiles and makes some notes in his pad. He talks to MITCHELL without looking up.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHWARTZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you have any questions, Mr. Stephens?

MITCHELL stares silently at NICOLE for a long time.

	Daddy was leaning forward in his chair, his mouth half open, as if he wanted to say something. Like what, Daddy? Like 'What about my money?'

NICOLE and SAM stare at each other.

EXT. COMMUNITY CENTRE -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICOLE is in the car in front of the community centre. She stares at SAM as he argues with MITCHELL on the steps.
</DIRECTION>
<NICOLE>
<DIRECTION>
(voice over)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Daddy took a long time. I guess he wanted to have a few words with you. He must have tried to tell you that I was lying. Then you would tell Daddy that it didn't matter if I was lying or not, the lawsuit is dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICOLE>
<DIRECTION>
As NICOLE'S words are heard, her point of view of SAM and MITCHELL arguing is seen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The movement of their lips is in sync with NICOLE'S voice over.
</DIRECTION>
<NICOLE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (voice over)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everyone's lawsuit is dead. Forget it. Tell the others to forget it. It's over. Right now, Sam, the thing you've got to worry about is why she lied. A kid who'd do that to her own father is not normal, Sam.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICOLE>
<DIRECTION>
SAM comes down the stairs and enters the car, sitting down at the driver's seat. NICOLE stares at him as he starts the car.
</DIRECTION>
<NICOLE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (voice over)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But Daddy knows who lied. He knows who the liar is. He knows who's normal.

SAM stares ahead, not knowing what to do next.
