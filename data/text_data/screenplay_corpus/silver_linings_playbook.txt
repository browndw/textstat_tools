	<DIALOGUE>
	You seemed to have trouble last night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_PATEL>
<PAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me just set the record straight about last night. Hurting my mother was a mistake and I hate myself for it, and I hate my illness and I want to control it. My father, on the other hand, had no trouble slapping the shit out of me last night, which I did not return `cause I could've killed him and I didn't. He's sixty-five years old. You don't think I could've beat the shit out of him? I mean....
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAT>
<DR_PATEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was scared for your mother and you hurt him as well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_PATEL>
<PAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, last night was a mess. Okay? And I think he probably just tried to do his best.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAT>
<DR_PATEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pat, you have to have a strategy. I told you earlier. You need to recognize these feelings coming to you, otherwise you will be sent back to Baltimore. So when you get these feelings, you need to get to a quieter place, and be at peace with yourself, however you can.
	</DIALOGUE>

	Yeah, but that's easier said than done.

	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_PATEL>
<PAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I don't know, because I'm married and I haven't seen my wife in eight and a half months?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAT>
<DR_PATEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe you think that Nikki's not around and Tiffany's an attractive girl and if you get drawn towards Tiffany, you will spoil your chances of getting Nikki back to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_PATEL>
<PAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not bad, Doctor Jones. But I don't think I'm gonna blow it with Nikki because Tiffany's a slut.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAT>
<DR_PATEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why is she a slut?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_PATEL>
<PAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	After the dinner at Ronnie's, she said, quote, "We can go to the back house and you can fuck me as long as we turn the lights out." Unquote. And she still wears her wedding ring. So she's a loyal, married-to-a-dead-guy slut.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAT>
<DR_PATEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe she just needs a friend and she thought if she offers you sex, it will be easier for you to become friends with her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_PATEL>
<PAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She said she's not a whore anymore, but she likes that part of herself along with all the other parts of herself and can I say the same?

</PAT>
<DR_PATEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you?
	</DIALOGUE>

<PAT>

	With all my crazy sad shit? What, are you fucking nuts?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAT>
<DR_PATEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pat, the silver lining thing is yours. I'm just giving back your words to you. This "crazy sad shit," as you call it, made you a happier, calmer person with a beautiful positive philosophy of going outdoors, working out, and reading books.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_PATEL>
<PAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, not the books.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAT>
<DR_PATEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You said Nikki's friends with Ronnie, Veronica and Tiffany. So if you become friends with Tiffany, Nikki will think that you're a kind, generous, large-hearted person, who helps people in need, who is basically thriving. So if you help Tiffany, it will be good for you.

	We were married for three years and five days, and I loved him. But for the last couple months, I just wasn't into sex at all. It just felt like we were so different and I was depressed. Some of that is just me, some of it was he wanted me to have kids and I have a hard enough time taking care of myself. I don't think that makes me a criminal. Anyway one night after dinner, he drove to Victoria's Secret at King of Prussia Mall and got some lingerie to get something going. And on the way back, he stopped on 76 to help a guy with a flat tire and he got hit by a car and killed. And the Victoria's Secret box was still in the front seat.

	"Dear Pat, It was very emotional for me to get your letter, as I'm sure you can imagine, but I'm glad you took the risk of discreetly getting it to me through Tiffany. This gives us a chance to communicate while I keep the restraining order until I feel safe. I must admit you sound terrific and I'm happy that you are feeling so positive and becoming a more loving and caring man, which I always knew you were. I was moved to read about `Excelsior' and your belief in happy endings. I am also moved by your act of love to read the books I have taught at the high school. I'm sorry you find them so negative, but I disagree. I think they are great works of art that reflect how hard life can be and they can also help kids prepare themselves for the hardness of life. In spite of all these positive developments, Pat, I have to say if it's me reading the signs, I need to see something to prove you are ready to resume our marriage. Otherwise I find myself thinking that we might both be better off moving on with our lives separately. Please don't react quickly to this, but take time to think about it. I'm glad you're doing so well. Love, Nikki."

	Let me tell you, I know you don't wanna listen to your father, I didn't listen to mine but I'm telling you, you gotta pay attention to the signs. When life reaches out with a moment like this, it's a sin if you don't reach back. I'm telling you, it's a sin if you don't reach back, and it'll haunt you for the rest of your days like a curse. You're facing a big challenge in your life right now, at this very moment, right here. That girl loves you, she really loves you. And I don't know if Nikki ever did, but she sure as hell doesn't love you right now. I'm telling you, don't fuck this up.
