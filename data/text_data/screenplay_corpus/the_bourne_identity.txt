EXT. OCEAN -- NIGHT

The darkness is actually water. A SEARCHLIGHT arcs across heavy ocean swells. Half-a-dozen flashlights -- weaker beams -- racing along what we can see is the deck of an aging FISHING TRAWLER.

FISHERMEN struggling with a gaff -- something in the water --

Transformed into a makeshift operating room. A light swings overhead. THE MAN layed out across the table. Sounds -- groans -- words -- snatches of them -- all in different languages.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GIANCARLO playing doctor in a greasy kitchen apron. Cutting away the clothes. Turning THE MAN on his side. Two bullet wounds in the back. Probing them, judging them.

Now -- GIANCARLO with a flashlight in his teeth -- TINK -- TINK -- TINK -- bullet fragments falling into a washed-out olive jar.

Now -- something catching GIANCARLO'S EYE -- A SCAR ON THE MAN'S HIP -- another fragment -- exacto knife cutting in -- tweezers extracting A SMALL PLASTIC TUBE, not a bullet at all, and as it comes free --

INT. FISHING BOAT BUNK ROOM -- DAY

GIANCARLO is hunched over a desk -- tweezers and flashlight -- busy working at that strange plastic tube that came out of THE MAN's hip.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE MAN is bandaged. He's sitting up, and it must hurt like hell, but physical pain is not the thing troubling him right now. He's staring around the room -- at his body -- at the walls -- haunted --

GIANCARLO staring at him now. Different suddenly. Suspicious.

THE MAN stands at the rail, staring out to sea. So lost. He turns to head inside -- there, a surfcasting rod propped against a locker.

THE MAN picks up the rod -- flips the bail -- traps the line -- now he's casting far out into the darkness. And for the first time, he smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FISHING BOAT GALLEY -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A ratty old espresso machine. THE MAN standing there, staring at the thing like it's a test. Then his hands begin to move -- trying to pack a grind -- trying to fit it in -- turning on the steam and --

<DIRECTION>
The whole thing explodes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FISHING BOAT DECK -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE MAN alone doing chin-ups on the deck rail. He's still bandaged and the wounds must hurt like hell, but he's pushing himself. Using the pain -- bathing in it -- maybe even hoping that it will hold some answer for him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FISHING BOAT GALLEY -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A chess board. Wooden pieces jumbled in a box. THE MAN hesitates -- takes a black knight from the box -- lingers for a moment -- and then places it on the board. He's off and running. He knows this. Placing pieces faster and faster -- still setting it up, as we --

INT. FISHING BOAT HEAD -- NIGHT

One of the ugliest bathrooms on the planet. THE MAN standing before a pitted, tarnished, cataract of a mirror. Staring at himself.

	I don't know who I am. Do you know who I am? Do have any idea who I am?

And then he stops. Blinks. Wipes away the perspiration just beading on his forehead.

	Tell me who I am. If you know who I am, please stop fucking around and tell me.

SAILORS hauling in the nets. THE MAN -- still bandaged, but healing -- working beside them. Earning his keep. Getting healthy.

<DIRECTION>
...THE MAN. People all around him -- families -- businessmen -- normal people going about their lives. THE MAN turns back to the window, but he's not watching the scenery -- he's looking at his reflection. So lost. His face suddenly plunged into darkness as the train bombs into a tunnel...

A VIDEO MONITOR -- FULL FRAME -- meet WOMBOSI. He's an African ex-dictator, think Idi Amin crossed with Mobutu. He's in some sort of throne room. And he's angry. Bodyguards and a translator hovering nervously around him. What this is, is NEWS FOOTAGE -- an interview conducted by a German TV station.

	...no, no, no -- the time is not right, my enemies are too strong. I'm telling you to wait for this, you understand? I'm telling you this, and I'm making a warning to all those peoples out there that think that my powers have become so weak that they can play with me as they wish. You will see -- I will tell you when the evidence is clear. Then you will have a story. My old friends will hear about themselves.

TWELVE CIA MANDARINS sitting around the table like kids in detention. We will tour the faces as MARSHALL continues, but the guy we're interested in is named WARD ABBOTT. Picture a sawier, slicker John Poindexter.

(the tape --)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wombosi likes to send us messages through the European media. This is an interview we pulled down from a local German television station in Dresden. We've been getting these little broadsides every couple of months. He knows this -- he knows that -- he's writing a book about the Agency's history in Africa -- he's going to name names. It's basically a shakedown...

ABBOTT'S FACE says this is news to him. HIS HANDS suggest otherwise.
</DIRECTION>
<MARSHALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This interview -- and I'll make the tape available for anyone who wants it -- he goes on to claim that he has just survived an assassination attempt. He says it's us. He says he's got proof.

INT. BANK SECURITY CHECKPOINT -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BIO-METRIC SCANNER. A piece of ultra-tech amidst the Baroque. TWO SERIOUS BANK GUARDS manning the equipment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE MAN standing there, staring down at this machine. Something ominously decisive about this. What if it's him? What if it's not?
</DIRECTION>
<BANK_GUARD_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They've been waiting your hand, sir...

</BANK_GUARD_1>

THE MAN focuses. Here we go -- BANK GUARD #2 guiding his open palm onto the mirrored scanning surface.

THE MAN catching his reflection for a moment before a wave of white light passes beneath his hand and now --

INT. BANK SAFETY DEPOSIT VIEWING ROOM -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sterile and kind of odd. But total privacy. THE MAN sitting there, as A DEPOSIT GUARD places a large SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX before him. THE GUARD leaves the room. Closing the door behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE MAN is alone. And there it is, right in front of him. This is it. Here are the answers. He lifts the lid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BOX. There's a shallow tray on top. In this tray: a beat- up passport in the name of Jason Bourne. A French driver's license with a Parisian address. Credit cards for Jason Bourne.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE MAN. Holding these objects close -- as if by holding them he might absorb their essence. Forcing himself to believe. This is him. His picture. There it is. He's Jason Bourne.
</DIRECTION>
<BOURNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My name is Jason Bourne.

	Hi, I'm Jason. Jason Bourne. Jason Bourne, nice to meet you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOURNE>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO -- THE BOX -- the shallow tray on top. There's Kleenex. Several sets of contact lenses. A knife. A comb. Three sticks of gum. A ring. A pair of sunglasses. A Rolex.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOURNE setting these things aside. Lifting the top tray. Staring into THE DEEP BOTTOM TRAY and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
First of all...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MONEY. Lots of it. Ten thousand dollar stacks of hundreds. Lots of them. Close to a million dollars. There's A GUN. A very good gun. Several clips of ammo. And...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FIVE MORE PASSPORTS. All clean. Crisp. Brand new. All with his photo inside. Five different names. Three different Countries. Each one of these pristine passports clipped to a piece of card stock that says:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NAME: NATIONALITY: PLACE OF ISSUE: SIGNATURE SAMPLE:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And a bar code. Two Dutch passports. A French. A South African. A Belgian.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's one piece of card stock still with the paper clip in place. And no passport. This card reads:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NAME: John Michael Kane NATIONALITY: U.S.A. PLACE OF ISSUE: Paris, France There's a signature sample. And a bar code. But no passport. This one is missing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOURNE sitting there. Trying to push his confusion away.

<BOURNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bourne. My name is Jason Bourne. I live at 121, Rue de la Jardin, Paris.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOURNE>

But there's something hollow about this. He came looking for one identity and now he's faced with six. The money... The gun...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, it's all fucked up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOURNE into gear. Looking around the room -- there -- there's a pile of red canvas burn bags in the corner. BOURNE grabbing one -- stuffing everything into it -- everything except...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The gun. He doesn't want the gun. No guns.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOURNE exits the bank. The red bag full to its limit. He's walking briskly now. Looking for a taxi. Nothing in sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOURNE crossing the street. Shit, there's A COP on the corner -- turn -- change pace -- make it look natural --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOURNE around a corner. And it's looking good for a moment -- but only a moment -- TWO MORE COPS walking a beat -- walking this way -- turn -- cut -- cross the street --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOURNE heading down a boulevard. Trying to look small. Pulse starting to race. Fighting the paranoia. Where the hell is a cab? Turning back fast as A SIREN starts bleeding in from behind him --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's just an ambulance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOURNE turning back. Forcing himself to focus. And fuck -- there's A METER MAID, and she's stopped writing up a ticket -- she's staring at him and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOURNE trying not to panic -- don't run -- smile -- stay small -- get to the corner -- scan the options -- but --

THE METER MAID -- she's watching him go and she's pulling her radio and --

EXT. U.S. EMBASSY COMPOUND -- DAY

Big gates. Speed barricades. SEVERAL U.S. MARINES standing guard near a gate house. An American flag. Lots of people coming and going. BOURNE playing it as normal as possible as he heads for the entrance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. U.S. CONSULATE ZURICH -- VISA ROOM -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The passport and visa office. Big room. No windows. Unpleasant on purpose. Two lines: A short one for U.S. Citizens, a marathon for everyone else. CONSULATE CLERKS stationed in open cubicles along the back wall. And it's a zoo. American tourists who've lost their passports. Foreigners looking for visas. Asylum seekers. Everyone here has a problem.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOURNE on the U.S. line. Standing there trying to think. What's he gonna say? What can he say? With the cops outside, and the incident in the park, then the bank...

EXT. ZURICH AIRPORT HOTEL -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A drone barn. Practically on the runway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ZURICH AIRPORT HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of those rooms. Just a plain functional box. MANHEIM laying on the bed. Fully dressed. Suit and tie. Just laying there, staring at the ceiling. Who knows how long he's been like this.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just waiting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE NIGHTSTAND -- A gun. A knife. His e-phone pager. His fresh credentials. And a photo of Jason Bourne.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WOMBOSI'S PARIS COMPOUND -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quick orientation: Picture a heavily-walled palace just off the Bois Du Boulogne. But once inside you could be back in Brazzaville. It's just a buffet of oddness. Home to fifty children and nine wives. The decor blends money and nouveau riche materialism with a hard, back-home tribal esthetic. It's a visual treat. Not condescending or stupid, but flat- out strange and menacing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's late. And the palace is dark and sleepy now, but carry all that through this next series of quick shots --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WOMBOSI HOUSE SECURITY STATION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just inside the door. BODYGUARD #1 slouched before a bank of SECURITY MONITORS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WOMBOSI MAIN HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Littered with toys. Children's crap everywhere. BODYGUARD #3. Snoozing on a Louis Quatorze chair draped with African cloth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WOMBOSI THRONE ROOM DOORS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DEAUVAGE -- head bodyguard -- posted outside this imposing set of doors. He's trying to stay awake. Reading a spy thriller.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FINALLY TO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WOMBOSI'S THRONE ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And there he is -- the emperor himself -- WOMBOSI on his throne. Except the room is dark and empty. And he's sitting there by himself. A king without a country.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sitting there. With a gun in his lap. Drinking hard from a bottle of Jack Daniels.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stewing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FRENCH ROADSIDE -- DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beautiful morning. The red car parked along the road. BOURNE alone in the passenger seat. Deep asleep. Nestled there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then, he wakes suddenly. Starts. Freaked for a moment. Instantly feeling for the red bag. There it is in his lap. He looks around and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARIE sitting away from the car. She's got a loaf of bread. A soda. Smoking a butt. Same clothes, but her make-up's been washed away. Clean. Simple. Gorgeous.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOURNE steps out. Morning legs.

</DIRECTION>
<ABBOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who is she?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABBOTT>
<ZORN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marie Helene Kreutz. She's twenty- six. Born outside Munich. Father was a welder. He died in '91. We don't have the mother. There might be a step-sister, we're trying to track that down.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(apologetic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's tough. She's a wanderer. She pops up on the grid here and there but... I mean, the last time she paid an electric bill in Europe was '94. No taxes. No steady employer. She's got three arrests. Two shoplifting cases, one in Spain, one in Germany. And she actually did three months in an Italian detention center for credit card fraud.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZORN>
<ABBOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No political affiliations?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABBOTT>

</CONKLIN>
<ABBOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm assuming we're exploring that possibility.

	<DIALOGUE>
	We're exploring every possibility.

(tighter by the moment)

	<DIALOGUE>
	We are in pursuit. How much more do you want me to tell you?

</CONKLIN>
<ABBOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pursuit would indicate that you know exactly where he is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABBOTT>
<CONKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Pursuit ends when we know exactly where he is.
	</DIALOGUE>

<ABBOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, well, I think we need some fresh eyes on this problem. I'm bringing in some people from upstairs.

</ABBOTT>
<DIRECTION>
CONKLIN hesitates. Inside he's screaming.
</DIRECTION>
<CONKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've been down here for two weeks banging our heads against the wall. We've been sleeping down here. We just got our first lead fourteen hours ago, and now? -- now that we finally have something to work with -- you want to bring planning personnel down here?

(real steam)
</DIRECTION>

MARIE pulling up -- turning a corner -- watching him as she does. But he's pre-occupied -- eyes scanning -- taking it all in --
</DIRECTION>
<MARIE>

<BOURNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Pull in here. Park it.

</MARIE>
<BOURNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess.

Dead pause. She's waiting. He's still scanning the street.

	I should go.

He turns back. She's staring at him.
</DIRECTION>
<BOURNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry. The money, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOURNE>
<DIRECTION>
Before she can say anything, he's digging in the backpack. He pulls out another stack of hundreds. Hands it over. She takes it. It's not what she wanted, but she's used to being disappointed. Fighting it.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, so...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIE>
<BOURNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks for the ride.

<MARIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got me pretty fucking curious.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Nah...

INT. PARIS APARTMENT BUILDING FOYER -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOURNE and MARIE standing at the directory. Five apartments. One per floor. Five names. A buzzer. An intercom. There it is.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
J. Bourne.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOURNE presses the buzzer. After a moment, he presses again. Nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess you're not home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIE>
<DIRECTION>
BOURNE checking the door. How to pop it open? Just about to get into it, when --

	<DIALOGUE>
	Monsieur Bourne...I'm coming...

	Here I am.

THE CONCIERGE looking at BOURNE like maybe she's never seen him look like this before. And she's looking at MARIE like here's the reason her tenant looks like such shit.
</DIRECTION>
<BOURNE>
<DIRECTION>
(he tries a smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I seem to have lost my key.

THE CONCIERGE nods. Instant chilly disapproval.
</DIRECTION>
<CONCIERGE>

INT. PARIS APARTMENT FIFTH FLOOR LANDING -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOURNE and MARIE at the apartment threshold. He has a key now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Turning it. And the door opens...

<DIRECTION>
Nothing...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No bombs. No wife and kids. No one.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PARIS APARTMENT -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A huge, rambling flat. Large entry hallway. Large rooms beyond that. It's obviously expensive. But cold. Completely impersonal. No photographs. No mementoes. No human history.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE'RE MOVING NOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE LIVING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOURNE and MARIE exploring.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's big.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIE>
<DIRECTION>
BOURNE silent. Struggling to get a feel for the place.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is like a real apartment.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she likes it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is really yours?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIE>
<BOURNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOURNE>
<DIRECTION>
MARIE taking it in fast. BOURNE seems paralyzed. Trying to soak it all in. Willing himself home. Touching things as he passes. As if a texture, a smell -- something will become familiar. He's deep into this as we go to --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARIE in the doorway. Checking it out. It's so clean and simple. But it's not the decor she's most interested in...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARIE opening an armoire...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing but men's clothes. No competition. She's feeling better by the moment as we go to --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE KITCHEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Like a stage set. Lots of props and no sign of food. BOURNE picking up a frying pan.
</DIRECTION>
<BOURNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is my frying pan.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(and then --)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is my spoon.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm Jason Bourne and this is my kitchen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOURNE>
<DIRECTION>
THE MASTER BATHROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARIE still on the prowl. Mirror city. Big tub. One toothbrush.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AN OFFICE STUDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a desk. Chair. Phone. Basic. BOURNE with a folder in his hand. Staring at the bookshelves. Binders, reference materials and hardbound volumes -- all of it about maritime law. Ship schedules. Registry catalogs. All about boats.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is your office?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(from the doorway)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God, you live like a monk...

</MARIE>
<BOURNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All this stuff -- it's all about boats.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I'm in the shipping business.

</BOURNE>
<MARIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See. It's starting to come back, yeah?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mind if I take a bath?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIE>
<BOURNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go ahead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOURNE>
<DIRECTION>
MARIE backs out. BOURNE alone again. Standing there for a moment. Dealing with it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then he sits down in a chair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOURNE sitting there. Staring. The room, the desk -- it's all so devoid of personality. And then, something catches his eye and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT -- THE DESK TOP -- a faint silhouette through the dust and grime. Outlines of where a computer used to sit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOURNE reaching suddenly under the desk. Bingo. Pulling out a retractable computer keyboard tray. But it's empty. No keyboard. Now he's really confused and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT -- A PHONE/ANSWERING MACHINE -- BOURNE pressing the playback button and --
</DIRECTION>
<PHONE_MACHINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"You have no messages."
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHONE_MACHINE>
<DIRECTION>
BOURNE leaving that for a moment -- about to anyway -- and then he turns back -- new idea -- pressing for the speaker phone -- and then hitting redial and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE PHONE stars dialing...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RINGING and...
</DIRECTION>
<OPERATOR_PHONE>
	<DIALOGUE>

BOURNE grabbing the backpack -- tearing through it -- where is it? -- where is it? -- shit and money falling out and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There it is -- from the safe-deposit box -- that piece of card stock -- the one with no passport attached to it --

BOURNE waiting. And then there's muzak -- holding music and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE MASTER BATHROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Water running in the tub. MARIE pulling off her boots. Checking the temperature.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE OFFICE STUDY

Bourne still on hold. And then --

Silence. BOURNE is rocked. But the Manager, it's natural, he interprets the silence as grief...

	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I'm sorry. It was very sudden. He was here very briefly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MANAGER_PHONE>
<DIRECTION>
BOURNE just hands up the phone. Just like that. Not even goodbye. Standing there frozen. Stunned. John Michael Kane is dead. And he had the passport.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, everything's changed. They shouldn't be here. This is bad. Danger.

<DIRECTION>
THE MASTER BATHROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARIE playing with her hair in the mirror. Checking the water --

THE OFFICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOURNE frozen there. On alert. He forces a smile. Decoy mood.

	Hang on. I'll check the kitchen...

</BOURNE>
<DIRECTION>
THE KITCHEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOURNE moving to the sink. He's smiling. Upbeat. But it's an act. His eyes are everywhere. Turning on the water. But ignoring it. What he's really doing is searching out a weapon. Pulling A KNIFE very quietly from behind the stove. Holding it. Feels pretty comfortable. Hiding it down by his side. On the move again, now --
</DIRECTION>
<BOURNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, it's cold in here, too...

<DIRECTION>

	Let's give it another minute.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOURNE>
<DIRECTION>
BOURNE like we've ever seen him. Like an animal. Every sound -- every breeze -- everything carries information.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standing still. Taking it all in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Real quick layout -- there's big windows along one wall that face out to the street below. The hallway to the bedroom and bath feeds into the living room from one side. There is a large frosted airshaft window along that hallway wall. Simple furniture.

THE GUN CLATTERING FREE across the floor and --

BOURNE -- his knee -- like a piston -- hard into CASTEL'S GUT -- and then down -- his foot -- down into CASTEL'S KNEE, shattering it and --

INT. CIA HALLWAY UPSTAIRS HALLWAY -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ABBOTT and CONKLIN walk and talk. They want to get loud, but they can't. Too many people passing by --
</DIRECTION>
<CONKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was two hours -- two hours to get a second opinion -- and nothing changes. He's loose. He's out of control. It's very clear what needs to happen.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I have work to do.

	</DIALOGUE>
</ABBOTT>
<CONKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Turn? To who? Where does he turn? What does he have to offer? He's got nothing. He's a killer. He's a piece of equipment for crissake. Where's he gonna turn?

<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOTEL DE LA PRIX -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Funky. Out of the way. Cash and carry. No-questions-asked kind of flop. Our establishing shot somehow includes THE PROPRIETOR and HIS DOG.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE HOTEL ROOM BATHROOM -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HAIR DYE washing down a rusted drain. It's MARIE alone in this crappy little bathroom. Jeans and bra. All of it soaking wet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A new hair color.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MIRROR. There she is. Her turn to stare at herself and wonder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then she smells something. Smoke...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a shitty little room. BOURNE sitting on the bed. And the smoke is coming from...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS PASSPORT -- the Jason Bourne passport -- on fire. BOURNE holding it as it burns away. Bourne's face -- melting -- bubbling -- finally disappearing, -- BOURNE letting go just before it burns his fingers and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOURNE sits back. And there's MARIE standing there. And she's holding out her passport --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at her. Big moment.
</DIRECTION>
<BOURNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he won't do it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know who you are. You know what that's worth? That's everything.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't live like this. I can't do anything until I know who I am. Believe me, you don't want what I have.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOURNE>
<DIRECTION>
He looks away. Silence. And then, she touches him. His shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOURNE almost recoils. Almost. He doesn't know what to do. Doesn't know how to react.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARIE in front of him now -- she's taking his hand -- and he hesitates -- looking at her -- is this happening? -- she's taking his hand -- moving it down her body -- staring at him -- both of them silent -- his hand -- her skin -- his mind racing -- he wants this -- wants it in every way -- but it's overwhelming -- when was the last time something like this happened? -- he can't remember -- he doesn't care -- he's pulling her toward him -- and they're kissing -- and you know the rest...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CDG AIRPORT -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE PROFESSOR arriving in Paris. Coming through the terminal as his pager goes off -- never even stopping as he reads and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HOTEL SEQUENCE -- SKETCHED ONLY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HOTEL MARBOEUF PARIS. This is the place that answered the phone when Bourne hit redial in his apartment. This is the place that John Michael Kane was staying when he "died."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And so begins, the investigation...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now, since the presence of danger -- ie Wombosi's guys and/or Treadstone -- is still up in the air, and since this scene could either play very quickly or very long, and since we're not exactly sure where we stand with page count -- this scene is not finished.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rules of the scene, however, seem to be thus: Bourne would have to be very nervous about being recognized. If he was Kane and Kane stayed here, he's not the guy to do whatever "social engineering" needs doing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Long version? Bourne sets the table and Marie gets the goods. Somehow there's a threat from Treadstone or Wombosi.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fast version? It's all results -- we see them execute a plan rather than work it up. MARIE is already in the hotel. In a hotel uniform? Posing as a guest? In any case, she looks very much different than we've ever seen her before.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She gets close to the office. Hides. Waits. BOURNE calls the desk from a pay phone. Asks for something. We see that some sort of improvised booby-trap has been set inside the hotel to start a fire. In the confusion -- MARIE -- very bravely -- gets into the office. We do a quick cut outside to Bourne waiting and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET OUTSIDE THE HOTEL MARBOEUF -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walk and talk. BOURNE and MARIE leaving the hotel fast. He's on alert -- always on alert now -- making sure they're not being watched. And she's excited and pumped -- she did it! -- she's got the hotel record in hand --
</DIRECTION>
<MARIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You stayed there five times in the past six months. But I didn't have time -- I could only get the bill from the last stay -- you were there for two days. Some room service -- there's half a dozen phone calls here so that's someth--

INT. AN EMPTY OFFICE SUITE -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vacancy wasteland. Dead phone lines hanging. Carpet pulled up. Completely stripped out. BOURNE and MARIE standing there staring.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This can't be it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIE>
<DIRECTION>
She turns around -- and what's he doing? -- BOURNE with a piece of paper and pencil -- or something/anything resourceful and handy -- maybe it's carpet lint -- maybe it's breaking the glass on the door and holding it up to the light -- or a rubbing -- anyway, he's doing something ingenious with the glass door --
</DIRECTION>

And as he's doing this, we're hearing --

INT./EXT. SHITBAG PARISIAN PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT

BOURNE on the pay phone. MARIE behind him at the bar. He's got a pad and paper. This is all business.

<RAWLINS>

A long awkward beat. Neither of them sure where to go.
</DIRECTION>
<RAWLINS>
<DIRECTION>
(finally)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, our bid -- it was competitive -- but definitely at the high end of competitive -- when we didn't hear back from you, we did some re-analysis of the numbers, and honestly, we'd really like a chance to do a bit better.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pitching now)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm assuming you're still in the market. It's the same vessel?

<BOURNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOURNE>
<RAWLINS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We just picked up a job quite like the one we were bidding for you. Gorgeous boat, hundred-and-seventy- five-foot pleasure cruiser. I think we learned a few things that might allow us to make our proposal for your job, as I said, a bit more competitive.

	Okay.

Another beat. Rawlins holding back until now...

<BOURNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me?

BOURNE entering. And there's MARIE in the back working a payphone -- waving for him to sit -- she's onto something.
</DIRECTION>

BOURNE sits. Pulls out the Alliance Security Brochures and literature. Flipping through it. Boats. Water. He's getting closer. Pictures of yachts and various security blurbs and a list of references for huge yachts -- jobs they've done in the past...

THIS SCENE HAS NOT BEEN WRITTEN

It's a shootout.

The Professor is infinitely more talented at this than the bodyguards.

Bourne needs to get out of there -- without looking wimpy --

<DIRECTION>
No children are harmed.

As the Professor rallies -- he will shoot Wombosi -- he will find Bourne's jacket left on the floor (in which later he will find a clue leading him to Belleville) and last but hardly least, he will take a parting shot at the bomb still sitting there on the throne.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There will be a huge, trailer-worthy explosion.

This might not want to be very long. There is an extensive action sequence just around the corner.

Now the PROFESSOR is moving -- not running -- just a swift walk and now he's past the truck -- and --

A MOTORCYCLIST comes flying down the street -- oblivious -- going way too fast for these streets and -- the PROFESSOR swings his gun stock like a bat -- takes him out -- clean and smooth -- bike crashing to the ground and --

CRACK! The PROFESSOR hits the front of a car sideways on his bike -- he is THROWN clear through the intersection, right into the windshield of an oncoming car and --

CAR CHASE THROUGH NARROW STREETS

Racing against traffic up the Seine. Past the Louvre. COPS pursuing on the other side of the river. BOURNE and the PROFESSOR leaving behind a trail of carnage. And now --

The PROFESSOR is pulling up along side them -- one lane over. Both swerving to avoid oncoming cars and --
</DIRECTION>

MARIE FIRES -- TWICE -- TAKES out a few windshields. The PROFESSOR fires at the same time -- MARIE'S CAR DOOR -- GONE -- she's totally exposed but --

<DIRECTION>
No problem -- he's unwrapping a piece of duct tape from the barrel of his gun -- two seconds and the hole is patched and -- BOURNE AND MARIE -- the side of the car is completely gone -- the PROFESSOR is gaining -- across the river dozens of police cars are racing alongside. Many more can be seen on their side -- a road block ahead -- running out of options and -- BOURNE turns hard -- crashes over the sidewalk and flies down a side street. A POLICE CAR pulls out behind them -- the PROFESSOR can't stop -- skidding hard, turning the bike sideways, skidding out -- sliding across the ground and BAMMM!!! SMASHING into a GLASS PHONE BOOTH which shatters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And he's up -- lifting up his bike and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOURNE AND MARIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SIX POLICE CARS on their tail -- more joining. Every street they look down has POLICE CARS racing in parallel. Running out of options and in the background --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE PROFESSOR is back in the game -- passing the police cars and up ahead --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE ROAD IS BLOCKED. POLICE ROAD BLOCK -- cops with guns. Gotta act quick and -- BOURNE turns hard left -- there's a metro staircase -- only way out and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THEY BOUNCE down the stairs. CRASH through the doors down below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FIRST POLICE CAR -- no way he's following. SLAMMING on his brakes. SKIDDING to a halt -- SKIDDING sideways -- gonna stop in time -- just at the edge of the steps and then --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SECOND POLICE CAR isn't braking -- T-BONES the first car -- BAM!!! -- sends it rolling sideways down the steps until it crashes to a halt at the bottom -- upside down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE PROFESSOR -- he's turning -- heading for a different set of stairs. BOURNE AND MARIE -- crashing through the turnstiles -- people diving out of their way and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE STAIRCASE -- THE WINDOW of the POLICE CAR is kicked out and -- TWO VERY ANGRY COPS emerge -- pull their guns out -- head into the station. BOURNE and MARIE's world just got a lot more dangerous and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE PROFESSOR is racing down the other staircase -- an up escalator -- people diving out of the way as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOURNE and MARIE slalom through the station -- suddenly -- there's the PROFESSOR -- parallel corridor -- metal barricades keep them separated. PROFESSOR FIRING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UP AHEAD -- a horizon line -- BOURNE guns it -- a steep staircase and -- THEY FLY down the steps -- landing on --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE METRO PLATFORM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The PROFESSOR lands on the other side -- both racing down the platform -- PROFESSOR tearing up the wall behind them and -- HERE COMES A TRAIN -- on BOURNE and MARIE's side -- travelling the opposite way -- temporary refuge. Not for long -- there's no way out on this end of the platform. They skid to a halt -- just as --THE TRAIN DOORS OPEN -- STARTLED STRAPHANGERS stare at BOURNE and MARIE as they stop onto the platform -- take off running.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE PROFESSOR has to turn his bike around. He's quick -- but it gives BOURNE and MARIE a two second head start.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOURNE AND MARIE almost at the other end of the platform -- gunfire ripping up the windows behind them. Gonna go for the steps -- but here come --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE ANGRY COPS -- remember them? -- the ones who took the ride down the steps -- they're firing now and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOURNE AND MARIE turn back -- the PROFESSOR is firing and there is only one option --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. METRO CAR -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOURNE and MARIE into the conductor booth. People diving off the train as BOURNE hits the YELLOW BUTTON and -- the TRAIN STARTS ROLLING -- doors still open -- they disappear into the protection of the tunnel walls -- then BOURNE hits the button to close the doors and -- THE PROFESSOR -- watching the trains accelerate out of the station -- and now he's racing his bike down the platform -- opposite the motion of the train and -- here comes the end of the train and --THE PROFESSOR throws his bike into a skidding 180 and skids off the platform all in one move -- landing hard on the tracks but facing the right direction and now he's accelerating towards the train -- just as an oncoming train is racing into the station and -- HE LEAPS onto the back of the train in the nick of time. His GUN CLATTERS to the tracks.

The window is shattered and the PROFESSOR lets himself in -- wind whipping through his hair from the shattered windows. And --

CRASH! The PROFESSOR grabs BOURNE through the glass, ramming his head into the metal as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOURNE grabs the knob, swings the door open and CRUSHES the PROFESSOR -- CRUSHES him again and now he is free and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOURNE turns, pulls up the shotgun and -- the PROFESSOR kicks it out of his hands -- it clatters to the ground and now we have a beat -- THE TRAIN CAR races across the Bir Hakeim bridge -- all of Paris laid out behind them. BOURNE and the PROFESSOR squaring off -- both looking at the gun -- realizing there's no chance for either one of them to get it and --
</DIRECTION>

A BRUTAL RUTHLESS FIGHT breaks out. BOURNE's motivated -- the PROFESSOR's crazy -- makes it a pretty even match. Looks like it could go on for a little while when suddenly --
