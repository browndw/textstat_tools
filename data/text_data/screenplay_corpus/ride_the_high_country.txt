EXT. HIGH SIERRA TRAIL - CLOSE ON BIRD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as it flutters helplessly about on the trail. A string, tying the bird's leg to a root, NOT VISIBLE FROM THIS ANGLE. Beyond the bird A MINER rides into view. The miner's only weapon is a rifle, in the saddle boot. A sizeable pouch of gold dust hangs from the saddle horn. Seeing the bird, he halts and reacts sympathetically. Dismounts, walks cautiously toward the bird, trying not to frighten it. Two SHOTS ARE HEARD. Both bullets hit the miner, who falls face down on the trail, and lies still.

EXT. HORNITOS STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As STEVE JUDD rides into the town of Hornitos. Judd is a tall, imposing figure of a man. In his mid-fifties, he holds his age remarkably well. Still, little things are seen that reveal his years. Thinning hair, gray at the temples, and a slight limp, memento of a gun fight years before.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Judd dresses with dignity, yet in his clothes is reflected evidence, however slight, of the adversity that has dogged him since the era of the 'town tamers' died a natural death. The cuffs of his shirt are frayed, there is a patch on the sleeve of his coat, and the boots are run over at the heels.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HORNITOS - ON JUDD - RIDING INTO TOWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A scattering of TOWNSMEN, MINERS and FARMERS line the board walks, all looking down the street in the direction Judd rides. They are waving and smiling. Judd reacts, looks around. Finally he is convinced that he is the focus of attention.

HIS POV - CAMEL-HORSE RACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Racing at full speed down the street are a CAMEL and three HORSES. With their RIDERS urging the animals on to even greater speed. The spectators CHEER ON their favorites. The horses, foam-flecked and slightly in the lead, are being overtaken by the camel.
</DIRECTION>

A SERIES OF ANGLES COVERING THE RACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CARNIVAL AREA AND FINISH LINE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a vacant lot off the main street. Consisting of four booths, three of them advertising, by posters, 'THE WILD MAN FROM BORNEO', 'HERCULES, STRONGEST MAN IN THE WORLD', and 'LITTLE SHEBA, BELLY DANCER'. Some TOWNSMEN, MINERS, FARMERS wander in and out of the booths. Most are grouped around the finish line. We HEAR HURDY-GURDY MUSIC FROM LITTLE SHEBA'S BOOTH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fourth booth is an open air affair, consisting of a counter, a rack of six-guns, and a home-made apparatus, similar to a modern skeet arm, which hurls objects into the air. Its posters, on a rack at the rear, depict a gentleman with long hair flowing from under his hat. He wears a Van- Dyke beard. In appearance and dress this could easily be 'Buffalo Bill' Cody at the height of his Wild West Show fame. But the legends on the posters read:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE OREGON KID in PERSON! Match Your Gun Skill With The Frontier Lawman WHO TAMED Dodge City & Wichita and who SINGLE-HANDEDLY Sent the Infamous OMAHA GANG to their GRAVES!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OVER the street is a banner marking the start and finish line of the camel horses contests. The legend reads:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE PHANTOM of THE DESERT!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Takes on All Comers Match Your Prize Racing Stock Against the Pride of Araby No Wagers Less Than One Dollar!

The camel overtakes the sweat-lathered horses and wins going away. HECK LONGTREE, the camel rider, dismounts, as do the riders of the horses. Heck is a handsome young man of twenty- three, rugged, brash, cocky. Two of the losers pay up and move away. The third, HANK, stands looking at the camel.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He puts it back in his vest pocket, prepares for a fight. Heck turns away as if to pick up the reins. Hank gives a snort of contempt. Heck whirls, swings a fist, knocking him flat. Hank lies on the ground, dazed. Heck takes the dollar out of his vest pocket, leads the camel away. Judd is about to leave when the Oregon Kid begins his spiel. Judd listens for a moment then grins and dismounts.

THE OREGON KID keeps up an almost constant spiel to WES, a cowboy, as he gets a tin can from a pile on the ground, places it on the pan of the hurling arm.

Outside the window, LOOKING THROUGH AT JUDD, are Heck and The Oregon Kid, minus his disguise of wig and Van-Dyke. This is GIL WESTRUM, a 'kid' no longer, but a big, jovial, graying man in his fifties. Gil possesses a happy-go-lucky quality, a friendly warmth instantly sensed by others and reflected by the twinkle in his eyes and the half smile almost constantly on his lips.

But now Heck is assaulted from two sides as Hank's friends join the attack. Heck is strong, agile and totally unafraid. But sadly outnumbered. He knocks a man down, but another one sends him sprawling onto Judd's table which shatters. Heck is groggy. Gil, without leaving his chair, hoists him back to his feet.

We catch glimpses of his daughter, ELSA, as she scatters hay about the loft with a pitchfork. Elsa is lovely as the wild flowers that would dot the surrounding hills if this were spring. And as untamed. She wears jeans, soiled shirt, heavy working shoes, and her hair hangs to her shoulders in twin braids. Glancing out the door opening, she sees the Judd party approaching. Wide-eyed, she watches.

Alarmed, she doesn't. Heck pretends to see something in the vicinity of her ear. Moves a hand slowly that way. Which brings his face close to hers. She follows his hand with her eyes, is suddenly kissed. For a few seconds Elsa doesn't resist. Then she fights, bites his lip. Heck yells in pain. Elsa rises, runs off. Heck touches his lip with his fingers, sees blood. Angry, he grabs her. She struggles, not too hard, to get free as Heck tries to kiss her. JUDD'S ARM ENTERS FRAME, grabs Heck, jerks him away from Elsa.

EXT. HAMMOND CLAIM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Three tents are pitched in the rocks. Water from a distant and unseen stream flows down a wood flume to spill into a sluice box, where gravel, transported to the box by wheel- barrow, is 'panned' in the swiftly flowing water. Beside the sluice box is a wash stand, soap, razor, towels, and mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Occupied with various chores are the HAMMOND BROTHERS. Clannish Southerners, they share a sardonic attitude toward life in general, and a latent appetite for violence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELDER HAMMOND, thirty-five, the bearded 'head' of the family, also the largest. Powerful physique, impassive countenance, his decisions are accepted by his brothers without question.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SYLVUS, next in age, sports a big moustache, lean, wiry, smiles often, but only with his lips, not the eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HENRY, mid-twenties, the 'dirty' one of the group, badly in need of a haircut, wears filthy clothes, chews tobacco, parts his thin beard with thumb and forefinger of a hand when spitting, called 'Henery' by the others. At present he is not in evidence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY, twenty-five, dark and handsome in a wild, flamboyant way. A smiling, devil-may-care personality. More colorfully dressed than his brothers, in a manner calculated to draw attention to him. While not the oldest, the unofficial leader of the group.

<DIRECTION>
JIMMY, nineteen, gangling and fuzzy-cheeked. What he lacks in brains, he makes up for in petty meanness.
</DIRECTION>

Billy is behind a tent, chopping wood. Sylvus stirs a pot on an outside cook stove. Elder works beside the sluice box. Jimmy wheels a barrow load of gravel to the box, dumps it on the ground.

Garishly furnished, with shabby rococo chairs and divans, a plank bar, and a Mexican guitar player -- El Quite. TINKLING JAPANESE LANTERNS hang from the ceiling. Seated at a table and now well into his cups is JUDGE TOLLIVER, a traveling, self-appointed dispenser of justice. The Judge wears "formal", if seedy, garb. From a corridor at the rear emerges KATE and the four GIRLS, BELLE, ROSE, CANDY and SAM. The Girls lined up facing the door have pale faces, dead eyes. All have been drinking and are more than a little sentimental. They are dressed in the manner of dance-hall girls fancied up for a wedding of that period. The room is full of miners, and a few squaws all dressed in their finest.

VIEWED THROUGH TREES, and down the hill. The JUDD PARTY rides INTO SHOT. At a signal from Judd, they halt.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait here while I look around.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDD>
<DIRECTION>
Hands the pack horses' lead rope to Elsa, rides off, keeping to the shelter of the forest. Heck looks at his gun on the pack horse, dismounts, crosses to the animal.

There is a pause.

<HECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never figured it'd work out this way...

(then, after a moment)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you still want to find a job in town, I think Mr. Judd would help.

</HECK>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was hoping he might.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<HECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chances are, I'll be locked up for awhile... I've got no call to bring it up... But... I think -- when I get out...

<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be there.

JUDD

Concealed by trees, he is looking down at the farm.

JUDD'S P.O.V. - MOVING SHOT ON THE FARMHOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing stirring at the house, except smoke coming from the chimney. CAMERA PANS to the grave, behind the house. Joshua Knudsen kneels behind the grave marker, his head bent in prayer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO JUDD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
sees Joshua. Satisfied all is well, returns to the others.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO HECK AND ELSA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
in rapt contemplation of one another. JUDD RIDES INTO SCENE.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDD>
<DIRECTION>
(to Elsa)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everything's all right. I saw your father.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(at her worried expression)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll talk to him.

Takes the lead rope, rides out of the trees, followed by Heck and Elsa.

LONG SHOT - JUDD PARTY - RIDING DOWN HILLSIDE, VIEWED THROUGH TREES

CAMERA PANS, HOLDS ON GIL. Seated on Sylvus' horse, watching Judd's Party.

impassively watching. Draws six-gun, checks it, replaces it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JUDD'S PARTY - RIDE TO THE CORRAL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
put the horses inside, walk toward house. At no time has the grave been visible to Elsa. Now, it comes into her sight. Joshua still leans against the head-stone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOSHUA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
his head at eye-brow level, rests on the wooden cross. Blood drops from his forehead across the face of the marker onto the dying wild-flowers scattered over the grave. In the B.G. the Judd Party walks toward the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVING SHOT - JUDD, HECK, ELSA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elsa, looking anxiously up the hill at her father, is puzzled.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's strange.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<JUDD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDD>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He goes to her grave every day. But always in the morning. Never in the afternoon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<DIRECTION>
Judd doesn't interrupt the pace of their walk, nor does he turn his head. As they approach a small ditch which offers partial protection from the house and barn, he motions to Heck.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In the ditch!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDD>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs Elsa, flings her into the ditch, dives after her, as does Heck. A BULLET ZINGS PAST where Judd had been a split second before. Judd, prone, draws his gun, rolls away from Heck and Elsa as ANOTHER BULLET digs into the ground beside him. SHOOTING FROM THE HOUSE AND BARN BECOMES GENERAL.

GIL - ON HILLTOP

Henry lies on the hay, shooting out the opening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KNUDSEN HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Billy Hammond FIRES through a broken window. A return SHOT shatters glass near his face. He jumps back, crouches, returns, rests his gun on the sill, and FIRES RAPIDLY SEVERAL TIMES until he runs out of ammunition. Moves away from the window, starts to reload. In the B.G. Elder, using a rifle spaces his shots more deliberately.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO JUDD PARTY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
huddled in the ditch, kept low by Billy's gunfire of a moment before. Heck, who is unarmed, looks with longing at the guns on the pack horses in the corral.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS P.O.V.

<DIRECTION>
The rifle and six-guns on the horse.

	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDD>
<DIRECTION>
But Heck is out of the ditch and running. Judd snaps off a SHOT at the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HECK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
manages to take three steps before he is hit. He goes down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JUDD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
goes after him, grabs him. And is scurrying back to the ditch when Heck is hit again, this time in the leg. As they reach the ditch, Judd is hit -- much more seriously, in his side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GIL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
puts spurs to his horse and at a flat out run, rides toward the house, gun in hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JUDD PARTY - IN DITCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elsa bends over Heck. He is hurt (leg and shoulder) bad enough to keep him out of the fight, but not bad enough to cause any future worry. Judd lies a short distance away, his face white with pain.
</DIRECTION>
<HECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fool stunt. I should have known better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HECK>
<JUDD>

He straightens and FIRES at the house.

Billy laughs, then falls silent, as GIL APPEARS IN THE FAR B.G., riding toward them. He YELLS a shrill, piercing Comanche war-cry.

<DIRECTION>
JUDD PARTY - IN DITCH

As Gil suddenly makes a crouching run to the ditch. Just as quick, Judd FIRES two shots at the house.

BILLY AND ELDER - IN PARLOR

Caught flat-footed, they duck as Judd's SHOTS whistle between them.

(looking at Heck's wounds)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This boy left Hammonds scattered all over the mountains.

</GIL>
<DIRECTION>
Satisfied the boy is not hurt too badly, he turns to Judd, only to duck as a BULLET whistles by.
</DIRECTION>
<GIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did you manage to end up in this enviable position?

</GIL>
<JUDD>

Henry reacts and begins to FIRE.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. DITCH - JUDD PARTY
</DIRECTION>

They duck the shots, then Gil YELLS.
</DIRECTION>
<GIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just two old men against all three of you boys...

</GIL>
<JUDD>

THEIR P.O.V.

The Hammond brothers, Billy and Elder come out of the house and stop. They are joined almost immediately by Henry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DITCH - JUDD PARTY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are silent for a moment, looking at each other. Then Gil and Judd rise and start for the Hammonds -- their guns are in their hands hanging easy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SERIES OF ANGLES - COVERING THE GUN FIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two groups are too far apart for effective six-gun work. Judd and Gil walk forward, the brothers waiting for them. Elder carries his rifle across his body. Slowly he begins to raise it.
</DIRECTION>
<BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll tell you when.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<DIRECTION>
Billy's gun is in its holster. Henry fiddles with his, checking the loads, as Gil and Judd walk forward, doing what they've done a hundred times before, but will never do again.
</DIRECTION>
<BILLY>
<DIRECTION>
(drawing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Start the ball, Old Man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<DIRECTION>
He begins to FIRE, his shots kicking up dust around Gil and Judd, who maintain their pace for a few more steps. Then, the distance to their liking, make a quarter turn and raise their guns. All the Hammond brothers are now FIRING and Judd is hit a second after he shoots Henry. He goes down to one knee and continues to fire, wounding Billy, but takes another slug from Elder as he does. Elder levels another shell into the chamber, swings the rifle to Gil, who SHOOTS him between the eyes. Gil is then nicked high in the shoulder by Billy, who has reached his feet and started FIRING again. Gil SHOOTS almost simultaneously with Judd -- both slugs catching Billy high in the chest, slamming him against the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment no one moves, then Henry lifts his gun for the last time -- and Gil kills him. The fight is over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GIL AND JUDD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gil kneels beside his friend, who still supports himself on one knee.

In the B.G. Heck leaning on Elsa approaches Judd.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want them to see this. I want to go it alone.

</JUDD>

Gil gestures and they stop.
</DIRECTION>
<GIL>
<DIRECTION>
(to Judd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry about -- about anything. I'll take care of it just like you would have.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIL>
<JUDD>
<DIRECTION>
(grins a little)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hell, I know that. I always did... You just forgot it for awhile, that's all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDD>
<DIRECTION>
He nods and looks away.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDD>
<DIRECTION>
(after a moment)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So long -- partner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDD>
<DIRECTION>
Gil stands looking at him, then turns.
</DIRECTION>
<GIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See you later...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIL>
<DIRECTION>
He moves away, Judd looks out over the foothills.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JUDD'S P.O.V.

<DIRECTION>
It is sunset. A rooster quail WHISTLES, gets an answer. Scolds his covey into the brush.

</ELSA>
<GIL>
<DIRECTION>
(having trouble with it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah -- he's goin' to be fine...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then to Heck)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on. Let's get you in the house.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIL>
<DIRECTION>
They move away, CAMERA PANNING to HOLD on Steve Judd for a long moment, then PULL BACK as he sinks to the ground. CAMERA CONTINUES TO MOVE, PANNING to the sunset.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
