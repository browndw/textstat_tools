SWOOOSH! A lethal, razor-sharp DISC BUZZES up over the horizon, swoops TOWARD the CAMERA and OUT OF FRAME!

The CAMERA SPINS AROUND to see the disc flying away, chasing a man, THADDEUS MORTON, wearing a strange metallic collar -- exhausted, horrified, about to die.

Morton zig-zags through a grove of trees, a desperate attempt to avoid the horrible serrated disc. But the ruse is futile. The disc goes straight through the trees, slicing a path straight as the crow flies.

NEW ANGLE - OLD WAGON

dilapidated, broken down, weathering away in the field. Morton runs around the wagon -- but the DISC BUZZES straight through the sideboards! Wood shavings spit everywhere! There's no stopping this thing.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOILED DOVE'S POV - GEN. McGRATH AND HUDSON

<DIRECTION>
HUDSON is a fearsome-looking Indian in a well-tailored suit. Long black braids descend incongruously from under a homburg hat. As for his companion...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
McGRATH is a mountain of drunken pus. Six foot, sweating like a Devonshire hog with his tattered, undersized Confederate dress jacket buttoned all the way to the top. His ear has been hacked off and replaced by what looks to be a miniature leather Victrola horn. McGrath smiles at our Soiled Dove and makes a little kissing gesture.
</DIRECTION>

ANGLE ON SOILED DOVE

Eyes widened in revulsion. What evil abides in this Godforsaken place? Now a drunkenly EYE-CROSSED REB licks Dora's ear, then whispers something in it. Something unspeakably vile, by Dora's expression.

As the other Reb comes at him, he spins, still holding the hat in front of him... and whap! Down that one goes. West looks up at the none-too-bright water tank woman.

As the carriage passes under the gas lamp, we can make out the top-hatted silhouette of McGrath's "employer," DR. ARLISS LOVELESS. Clustered around him inside the cab are three more beautiful women. As he strokes the cheek of the ORIENTAL one with the back of his hand like a cat...

Whooa, hoss... the Soiled Dove is a man! He's ARTEMUS GORDON and his true profession will be revealed to us shortly. But now, as he/she stashes the unconscious Reb behind the bar, straightens bosom and wig...

As he pulls on one leg of his pants, a guard lunges at him with a knife. West hops up on one leg, smacks the guy with a mule kick.

Now he puts his arm through his shirt sleeve. When the hand emerges out of the cuff, it's balled in a fist -- which coldcocks the other guard.

	Could I have a little privacy here?

He calmly looks up in time to catch the falling, naked, screaming Saloon Girl in his arms.

... the WINDOW EXPLODES. Jim West comes tumbling into the room, kicks the knife out of McGrath's hand in one smooth move. West rolls to his feet, fixes a gallant smile on Gordon/Dora.
</DIRECTION>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't mean to startle you, ma'am. Looked like you could use some help.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<DIRECTION>
It takes Gordon a moment to recover. He stares at this black Samaritan, obviously having no clue who he is.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDON>
<DIRECTION>
(clears throat to recover falsetto)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looks can be deceivin'... dark stranger. I am perfectly fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDON>
<DIRECTION>
West quickly pats McGrath down, removes a revolver and his bag of gold coins.
</DIRECTION>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can see that, darlin'. Woman of your caliber probably gets top dollar, too. So here you go.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(flips her McGrath's coin bag)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can run along. I'll take care of McGrath.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<DIRECTION>
As West sticks the barrel of his gun in McGrath's gramophone ear, Gordon's eyes pop.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDON_DORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! I need him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDON_DORA>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, lady. You got the money. Have a little dignity.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<DIRECTION>
Gordon jerks West's gun hand away from McGrath's head just as the dog-soldier comes around. McGrath suddenly lunges at him.
</DIRECTION>
<McGRATH>
<DIRECTION>
(bellows ferociously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	West...!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</McGRATH>
<DIRECTION>
He drives his full weight into Jim's back, pushing him out into...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FAT-CAN'S - UPSTAIRS HALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
McGrath's rebel yell brings help from all directions. DOORS BANG open all along the hallway. Not just McGrath's men, but Hudson and his crew. A melee will ensue.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
West pushes the monster off of him, rolls as a BULLET SPLINTERS the WOOD where he just was. The SHOT STARTS...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - STAMPEDE OF SEMI-CLAD WHORES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
all screaming hysterically and heading for the exits. The beautiful young singer, who'd been coming up the stairs alone, is now swept back down them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordon, still in character, pushes his way upstream to the room where the scientist is held.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FAT-CAN'S - ADJACENT ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hudson, his back turned, barking orders at his henchmen.
</DIRECTION>
<HUDSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get Escobar out of here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HUDSON>
<DIRECTION>
The henchmen heft the wriggling sack, when:
</DIRECTION>
<GORDON>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leave him right there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDON>
<DIRECTION>
Hudson whirls to see the gruff-talking Gordon/Dora holding the perfume bottle on him like it's a Colt 45. Now Gordon shakes one of the heavy bracelets off his wrist, CLICKS a LOCK, snapping it open. He's accessorized with custom handcuffs.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go, Hudson... hands!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDON>
<DIRECTION>
Hudson gives a sick little smile, reaches for his gun when... WSSSSHT!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordon sprays him in the eyes with the second bulb of the atomizer. (The first Mace!) Hudson howls in pain, drops the gun, rubs his eyes madly with both hands.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank... you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDON>
<DIRECTION>
Gordon starts to snap the cuffs on the perfectly presented wrists when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FAT-CAN'S - UPSTAIRS HALL - WEST - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
brawling a dozen attackers. West spots McGrath trying to escape down the stairs. He uncorks a lethal kick, sending a thug flying through the doorway and into the back of Gordon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordon staggers, drops the perfume/mace BOTTLE which SHATTERS. Hudson recovers his vision enough to send a fist into Gordon's mascaraed face, pile-driving him back into the hall. While Hudson and his men make their escape down the back stairs with the scientist sack...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE - WEST AND GORDON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
West is blocked from chasing McGrath, Gordon from going after Hudson. West tries to push her aside.
</DIRECTION>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	U.S. Army... Now get outta my way, lady!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<GORDON>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm no lady! I'm a U.S. Marshal! You get out of my way!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDON>
<DIRECTION>
Gordon whip off his wig, reaches inside it for something. West blinks at the weirdness, reflexively draws his Colt. As Gordon withdraws not a gun, but a badge, from his wig...

</DIRECTION>
<LIPPENREIDER>

(in a monotone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get out of my way... get out of my way... U.S. Army... U.S. Marshal.

</LIPPENREIDER>
<LOVELESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, dear...

</LOVELESS>
<DIRECTION>
The lip-reading is interrupted by the arrival of...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
who come racing up with the scientist-in-the-sack.
</DIRECTION>
<HUDSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Federal agents inside, sir!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HUDSON>
<LOVELESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So Miss Lippenreider informs me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(sighs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Still, I believe good manners dictate we should send out...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOVELESS>
<DIRECTION>
His cane telescopes out and Loveless pokes the lynch pin out of the harness on the nitro wagon. Then he gives the wagon the slightest push.
</DIRECTION>
<LOVELESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... the welcome wagon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOVELESS>
<DIRECTION>
Once started, the wagon rolls downhill, toward the back door of Fat-Can Candy's, picking up speed...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, as his female coterie pulls the burlap sack into the carriage, Loveless steps in behind. And they're off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FAT CAN'S - UPSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT

West and Gordon, oblivious to the impending disaster...
</DIRECTION>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So now what...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<DIRECTION>
The answer is provided as the NITRO WAGON hits downstairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABOOOOOOM!!! THEME MUSIC UP... as we roll...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MAIN TITLES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The titles are the familiar animated freeze frames from the TV show. In the two corners are our heroes -- Upper left shows West with his gun levelled toward... upper right -- Gordon with his wig in one hand and his badge in the other, pointed across toward West.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cowboy/agent in the middle square fights and defeats the various bad guys. Then as he exits, QUICK ZOOM ON main title: "THE WILD WILD WEST."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAN DOWN TO a sketch of a train caboose as TITLES END...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WASHINGTON, D.C. - DAY (1869)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
West rides his magnificent black stallion down Pennsylvania Avenue.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Besides horse-drawn carriages, West shares the dusty road with people on bicycles -- the latest craze. He finally pulls his steed up at his destination...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WHITE HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
West dismounts, ties his horse to a hitching post and winces as he puts his weight on a sore leg.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WHITE HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
West limps past black floor scrubbers. They stop working to marvel at this handsome black man dressed in custom cowboy duds walking in there like he owns the place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But not everybody's so impressed. As West heads toward the Oval Office, four self-important house detectives block his way.
</DIRECTION>
<HOUSE_DETECTIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa there, 'pardner.'
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as West stops)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Winning the war may have got you forty acres and a mule, but you can't just traipse into the President's office. Now gimme that gun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOUSE_DETECTIVE>
<DIRECTION>
He nods at the six gun on West's hip. West coolly flexes his hand above it, like he's about to draw...
</DIRECTION>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This gun?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<DIRECTION>
Then like lightning, with his other hand, he whips out a sawed-off shotgun hidden by his jacket. He pokes the 12-gauge barrels up against Pinkerton's surprised crotch.
</DIRECTION>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or this one?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<DIRECTION>
A voice stops the situation from escalating further.
</DIRECTION>
<PRESIDENT_GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gentlemen!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRESIDENT_GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
The detective's head swivels around to see...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - OVAL OFFICE DOOR - PRESIDENT GRANT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stands in the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<PRESIDENT_GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't make Captain West any later for his appointment than he already is!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRESIDENT_GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
The detectives back away from the hair-trigger cowboy as fast as they can. West reholsters the gun and continues...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
President Grant goes over to his desk, lights a cigar. Backlit in the haze, the portly bearded figure lives up to the myth.
</DIRECTION>
<PRESIDENT_GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Been a lot of death threats lately ... Cabinet made me hire some damn detectives.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(by way of apology)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drink, cigar?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRESIDENT_GRANT>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<DIRECTION>
West limps across the room to the bar, pours himself a glass of whiskey, takes a cigar out of the humidor.
</DIRECTION>
<PRESIDENT_GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hear you let General McGrath get away?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRESIDENT_GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
Now West's blood is up.
</DIRECTION>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, I had him right in my hands when some half-a-sissy wearin' a dress ruined...

<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You... know him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<PRESIDENT_GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course I know him, he's the best marshal I've got! He's a genius.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off West's incredulous look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gordon has proven himself time and again as a very cunning operator with a rapacious intellect. Nothing will stop him from completing a mission for his President... except the impulsive actions of a headstrong cowboy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRESIDENT_GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
West just looks at him soberly. Draws his gun and places it against the President's head. Grant's eyes widen.
</DIRECTION>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<PRESIDENT_GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am the President of the United States!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRESIDENT_GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
West points the GUN to the ceiling and pulls the trigger. BLAM!!! As Grant jumps a foot and plaster rains down...
</DIRECTION>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wrong answer. Who are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<PRESIDENT_GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am the President of...

(as West cocks gun)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... I'm Artemus Gordon.

West lowers his gun, nods at Gordon's class ring.
</DIRECTION>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The President went to West Point ... not Harvard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<PRESIDENT_GRANT>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Will somebody tell me what the hell this stunt is all about!?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRESIDENT_GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - SIDE DOORWAY - PRESIDENT GRANT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(the real one) stands in the doorway, hands on hips, surrounded by his house detectives -- their guns drawn. West nudges the fake Grant in the fake belly with his gun barrel -- go ahead. Sheepishly, Gordon starts peeling off his primitive, but effective, facial prosthetics.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, in perilous times like these, I was simply illustrating how someone impersonating you could actually walk right into the very bowels of the White House...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDON>
<DIRECTION>
Just as Gordon makes his intestinal allusion, West takes a ceremonial bayonet off Grant's desk and pokes a hole in the inflated bladder that was his fake paunch. The AIR HISSES out, finishes deflating with a flatulent R-R-RIP. (Hey, the first whoopee cushion?)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordon scowls at him.
</DIRECTION>
<PRESIDENT_GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're clever, Gordon. One day it'll get you killed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRESIDENT_GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
West smirks as Grant looks up at the bullet hole in the ceiling, then fixes West with a disapproving eye.
</DIRECTION>
<PRESIDENT_GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... And you, West -- not every situation calls for your patented approach of shoot first, shoot later, shoot again -- then when they're all dead, try to ask a question or two.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(shakes his head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Working together will be good for both of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRESIDENT_GRANT>
<WEST_AND_GORDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But, sir, I work...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST_AND_GORDON>
<PRESIDENT_GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You work the way your Commander In Chief tells you to work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRESIDENT_GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
Grant turns and EXITS FRAME.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WHITE HOUSE - WAR ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The place is a buzzing intelligence operations center -- state-of-the-art for the 1860's. Maps of the U.S. and the world are on the wall. Various staff and military people work CLACKING TELEGRAPHS, PRINTING MACHINES that GRIND out reports, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grant stops at a display of daguerreotype photos, all depicting distinguished bewhiskered men.
</DIRECTION>
<PRESIDENT_GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ten of our country's best scientists... all kidnapped in the last year. By General McGrath, it now seems.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turns to them)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The fact is, gentlemen, you've both been working on the same case all along. Why did it take you so long to realize it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRESIDENT_GRANT>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, sir, one of us was still trying to figure out if he was a man or a woman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<DIRECTION>
The detectives snicker over that one. Grant's had enough.
</DIRECTION>
<PRESIDENT_GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't have time for this bickering! One week, if we're to believe this...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRESIDENT_GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
Grant holds out a letter to Gordon and West. Gordon snatches it, reads:
</DIRECTION>
<PRESIDENT_GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
(reading)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'General Grant, the scientists that you seek are in my employ -- -- Creating a weapons system beyond the pale of contemporary imagination. History and justice are on my side. I suggest you put your affairs in order. You have one week before you will surrender the U.S. Government.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRESIDENT_GRANT>
<PRESIDENT_GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This letter was delivered inside this.

An aide presents a glass case. Inside is a cake in the shape of the White House.

(grabs his hand)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRESIDENT_GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly dozens of deadly-looking spiders swarm out from inside the cake. Gordon jerks his hand back.
</DIRECTION>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's McGrath, sir. The South is rising again. I'm gonna stop it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<GORDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, West's obsession aside, McGrath may be a vicious killer, but a mastermind he is not. So whom do we seek? After consulting with Intelligence...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDON>
<WEST>
<DIRECTION>
(cuts him off)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	McGrath's headed for New Orleans. The longer we stand here talkin', the farther away he gets. I don't need 'Intelligence' to tell me that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<GORDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, so that would mean you rely on ... Stupidity?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDON>
<DIRECTION>
Grant's had enough.
</DIRECTION>
<PRESIDENT_GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gentlemen! I'm leaving today for Utah where the transcontinental railroads will be joined at Promontory Point.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRESIDENT_GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
Grant points to a map of the United States. The railroad lines have been drawn in... still a gap between them.
</DIRECTION>
<PRESIDENT_GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For the first time the United States will truly be united.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turns, holds up letter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Someone wants us divided. Now look, you two are the best I've got. Put aside your differences and stop this madman... whoever he is. If you fail, well... we may never know how great this country could've been.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(snaps off a salute)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have a week. Dismissed!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRESIDENT_GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
They both return Grant's salute as the President stomps off. His AIDE now approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<AIDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The President has put a private train at your disposal. Engine number five, track six.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(holds out a wrapped box)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Gordon, the item you requested.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AIDE>
<DIRECTION>
Gordon takes the box, hurries to catch up with West.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WHITE HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
West and Gordon, walking toward the hitching post. West is so beside himself he can barely untie his high-voltage stud. He glowers at Gordon who goes over to where...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - STRANGE-LOOKING BICYCLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Is parked on the other side of a bush. It has the customary big wheel in the front, little wheel in the back. (Hidden from sight is a motor on the front tire. Dual manifolds that sling under the rider's legs.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
West shakes his head in disgust.
</DIRECTION>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Figures.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<GORDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I call it the Bi-axle Nitro- Combust...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDON>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Save it. I've gotta train to catch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<DIRECTION>
West swings into the saddle. He looks at the SNORTING wild HORSE under him, then down at Gordon attaching the box onto the seat of his Nitro-whatever.
</DIRECTION>
<WEST>
<DIRECTION>
(snaps off a smug salute)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yee-haaa!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<DIRECTION>
West spurs his horse and leaves Gordon in the proverbial cloud of dust.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Although West's intentions are clear, for some reason, Gordon's in no particular hurry. He sighs, climbs on the bike, takes out a hankie and cleans a pair of goggles. Then, finally ready...
</DIRECTION>
<GORDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Avant!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDON>
<DIRECTION>
VROOOM! An ENGINE KICKS IN and Gordon rockets forward. (Yep, Artemus has invented the first motorcycle!) Fiery exhaust blasts out of the manifolds as the bike propels him down the street at about 60 mph right past...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON WEST AND HIS STALLION
</DIRECTION>

who both look over in wide-eyed shock. The horse rears as Gordon SCREAMS by -- leaving them in a cloud of internal combustion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. C STREET TRAIN STATION - TRAIN ENGINE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From in front, as it CHUGS TOWARDS us. Sitting up in the spanking new steam engine (No. 5) is a white-haired Coleman. The Wanderer is his pride and joy. Coleman pushes the throttle forward and the ENGINE ROARS PAST us... followed by a tender, and two gleaming passenger cars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then comes West THUNDERING past in a desperate effort to catch up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - WITH WEST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
riding like hell. Getting the last ounce of speed out of his well-lathered steed, he finally pulls alongside the rear passenger car. He looks up... In the window, we see Gordon engrossed in what he's doing... which appears to be sewing.
</DIRECTION>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop this train!! You hear me!?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<DIRECTION>
If Gordon hears him, he pretends not to. He just casually makes the next stitch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
West's horse has had it. They're losing ground to the train. At the last second, West leans over at full gallop and grabs a handle on the side of the train. He swings out of the saddle, hanging on for dear life, blowing in the breeze like laundry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, his boot finds a small metal plate to put its weight on. Just as West stands safely on it... whoosh! He flies up in the air and drops through a sliding partition in the roof.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WANDERER - PARLOR CAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car is like a classy Victorian men's club. Bar stocked with crystal decanters, a pool table, decorative pistols on the wall, books, etc. Gordon, seated in a club chair, looks over as West falls from the ceiling into a seat. He's hot, dusty and very pissed off. He glowers at Gordon murderously.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDON>
<DIRECTION>
(calmly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks for dropping in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDON>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forget the bikes, the beards, the fake boobies. Put down the needlepoint and let's settle this like men!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<DIRECTION>
He takes off jacket, starts rolling up his sleeves. Gordon remains remarkably cool, continues sewing.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As a matter of clarification, this isn't needlepoint. This is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDON>
<DIRECTION>
He shows him some real needlepoint.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right now, I'm putting the final touches on a new invention of my creation. I call it... The Impermeable. It's a vest that, when worn under the clothing, can stop any modern bullet fired even at close range.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDON>
<DIRECTION>
West draws his gun, aims it at Gordon's stomach and cocks the trigger.
</DIRECTION>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<DIRECTION>
Gordon quickly pulls the vest away from his stomach.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But it hasn't been really tested empirically yet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDON>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<DIRECTION>
West takes off his guns and puts them on the table.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDON>
<DIRECTION>
(yawn, yawn)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guns. I find them so primitive and unnecessary... if one has done one's proper planning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDON>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah? How do you feel about a fist?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<DIRECTION>
Gordon puts down The Impermeable, stands with a weary sigh.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I must tell you, Mr. West, I've always felt that allowing a situation to degenerate into physical violence is a failure on my part.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDON>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well then, 'Mr.' Gordon, you failed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<DIRECTION>
Whap! West unleashes a lightning punch that drives Gordon across the train car. He dabs at his bloody lip.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, Mr. West, you brought this on yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>

Then to West's utter amazement, Gordon puts his hands together as if praying while at the same time, crooking his right leg stork-like. Is this some kind of martial art? Then, he bends at the waist, and like a ballet dancer, extends his leg out to the wall and flips a switch.

It immediately triggers a leather hammer to swing down from the ceiling. It whacks West on the side of the head, and sends him spinning back onto the pool table.

	Mr. West, how nice of you to join us tonight... and add color to these monochromatic proceedings.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOVELESS>
<DIRECTION>
West keeps a lid on his temper. Two can play at this game.
</DIRECTION>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, when a man comes back from the dead, it's an occasion to stand and be counted.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<DIRECTION>
Loveless smiles slightly.
</DIRECTION>
<LOVELESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miss East informs me that you were expecting to meet General McGrath here. I knew him years ago... but haven't seen him in a coon's age.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOVELESS>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I bet a man like yourself would find it difficult to keep in touch with even half the people you know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<DIRECTION>
Danger flickers in Loveless's eyes. He looks to Miss East.
</DIRECTION>
<LOVELESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps the lovely Miss East will keep you from being a slave to your disappointment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOVELESS>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you know beautiful women... they encourage you one second, cut the legs out from under you the next.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<DIRECTION>
Loveless's face drops. He is no longer amused. Miss East winks at West, then accompanies Loveless in the direction of the study where...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOVELESS MANSION - OUTSIDE STUDY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
General McGrath waits impatiently. He takes two champagnes off a passing tray, guzzles them, then wipes his mouth on Dolly Madison's bustle. As his eyes sweep the room...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - WEST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He ducks behind a mountain man carrying the French tricolor. When Loveless and General McGrath disappear into the study and close the door, West eases after them. He pauses as he passes the "Soiled Dove," leans into her big bouffant. He regards a stained-glass window patterned with a spider over her shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, honey... I see a big ole spider up on the wall. Hope it doesn't drop down your pretty dress.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<DIRECTION>
As the Soiled Dove jumps a little, West continues over to the study door. Now the Soiled Dove turns, and we see the scared/confused expression. Maybe it's because she is not Artemus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - GORDON - ACROSS ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's the mountain man in the fringe jacket. And right now he's shaking his head as he watches West resort to a decidedly low-tech surveillance method of Loveless's study.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
McGrath paces in front of Loveless's desk.
</DIRECTION>
<McGRATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Loveless, my men are ready to go to war with no weapons to fight. Ever since the nitro and the guns were destroyed at Fat- Can's, lice and demoralization have set in!
	</DIALOGUE>
</McGRATH>
<LOVELESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your men will have their weapons tonight. And my promise that they will be part of the greatest military victory of this century!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOVELESS>
<DIRECTION>
McGrath's face relaxes into a pyorrheic grin.
</DIRECTION>
<McGRATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, you're a pip, sir! I'd follow you into the maw of Cerberus himself!
	</DIALOGUE>
</McGRATH>
<DIRECTION>
Loveless takes pencil in hand and draws a map on the desk.
</DIRECTION>
<LOVELESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And so you shall.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(makes an X)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have your men here at... 10 o'clock tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Loveless wheels his chair toward the door with McGrath behind him folding up the map...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOVELESS MANSION - OUTSIDE STUDY - WEST - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ducks out of the way as Loveless and McGrath emerge from the study. As they disappear into the throng of well- wishers, West takes a thin lock-pick out of his hat band. It takes him a moment or two, but the LOCK finally CLICKS. Then West slips inside, apparently undetected -- except by an unimpressed Gordon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
moves quickly to the desk past walls filled with oil portraits of various Loveless relatives. The one behind the desk is in the style of Gainsborough. A Loveless uncle is standing on a windswept grouse moor, two English setters by his side, a Holland and Holland double held in the crook of his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
West turns his attention to the desk blotter. There's a faint imprint where Loveless drew the map. West takes his penknife and a pencil -- grates some graphite into the depressions. He's just about to do a rubbing on a piece of paper when... someone swipes it out of his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON MISS EAST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hands on hips, she gives him a "naughty, naughty" look.
</DIRECTION>
<MISS_EAST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said to meet me in the foyer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MISS_EAST>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, the foy-aay. Sorry, I've never been much good at French.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<DIRECTION>
But instead of scolding him further, Miss East plants an over-heated kiss on him. Tongues are involved. As they break, she gives a little nod of approval.
</DIRECTION>
<MISS_EAST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Au contraire...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MISS_EAST>
<DIRECTION>
She pushes him down into Dr. Loveless's chair.
</DIRECTION>
<MISS_EAST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So let's see, Mr. West... are you a dangerous spy of some sort? Or just a handsome cowboy who likes to... poke around.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MISS_EAST>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Um... that second one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<DIRECTION>
She starts to undo the buttons of his trousers. But West has a job to do. Well, maybe he can do two jobs at once...

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Munitia and Lippenreider come out of an upstairs bedroom, lock it behind them. Hmmm. What's in there? As he starts upstairs, Amazonia appears, blocking his way.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Howdy there... big sturdy gal. Yer dance card full?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDON>
<DIRECTION>
Amazonia stares at him, then spiels off a couple lines in a foreign language that makes Gordon's eyes widen. He understands what she said and it's not flattering. Gordon moves off in a shock.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE - WEST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Damn. He lets Miss East concentrate on what she's doing, which from the SOUNDS O.S., doesn't appear to be a demonstration of the correct way to butter corn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
West spies a mirror on the other side of the room and raises her ass up into position so he can see the corrected reflection.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON MIRROR - MAP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COMES INTO VIEW. It clearly shows the meeting place to be Malheureux Point, northeast of New Orleans. But the mirror reflects something else of interest...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOVELESS MANSION - STUDY - PAINTING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The painting behind him has come to life. The Loveless in the painting swings a real shotgun around and is pointing it at the back of West's head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE - WEST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
suddenly contorts his upper torso just as an EXPLOSION rips the back of the chair where his head would have been.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He draws and SHOOTS the would-be assassin, who falls out of the painting, dead. West turns to see...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON MISS EAST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A surprised look on her face. A hole in her forehead. He lowers her head gently to the ground, regards her map-imprinted rear end.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I found that our host, Dr. Loveless...

</WEST>
<DIRECTION>
West looks over to where Loveless is leading a contingent of foreigners out a side exit.
</DIRECTION>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... is meeting McGrath and his troops at Malheureux Point in an hour.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(bends her back)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you enjoy the party. I'm gonna go save the Republic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<DIRECTION>
The Soiled Dove look-alike is speechless. Before he goes, West leans in, smirks.
</DIRECTION>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I will say, good work on your bladders tonight... they're damn perky.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<DIRECTION>
And just to dig the grave deeper, West lays hands on them and gives them a little squeeze. This immediately elicits a scream and a slap in the face that shocks the bejesus out of the black cowboy. And he's not the only one.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON CROWD

	Hang him!

</GORDON_MOUNTAIN_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
And with that, Gordon opens his deerskin jacket to reveal his own rope, which he throws to the mob. West looks back at the character in amazement. That's Gordon?! Before West can say or do anything, guns are at his temple, and he's swept out of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordon calmly straightens his coonskin cap, seemingly uninterested in West's imminent hanging. In the hubbub of everyone rushing out for the hanging, Gordon heads up the unguarded stairs to the locked room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he pulls out his high tech auto-wind lock-pick and quickly gains entrance to the door...

Hand-held torches illuminate. The rope is tossed over a lamp post. PAN DOWN TO where one of the mob, dressed as GEORGE WASHINGTON, is binding West's hands behind his back.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE_WASHINGTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looks like we're gonna have to teach y'all a little lesson on how to behave in polite society.

<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't grab a white lady's boobies at the big redneck dance. Is that the lesson? Well, I learned it. Don't scratch your head with the shrimp fork. I got that one too. So whaddaya say we call this off?

To Rita's amazement, Gordon opens his jacket and unbuttons his vest to reveal... a complete miniature tool shop. Quickly he pulls out a thin cable and attaches it to a tiny wheel on the spur of one of his boots.
</DIRECTION>
<RITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm Rita. I was hired here as an entertainer. Not that I'm complaining, but what are you doin' in here?

Gordon unsnaps the sole of his shoe. It becomes a pedal that operates the wheels' rotation. Now he removes a bit and handle from his vest and attaches the cable. Starts to pump his foot. It's a foot-powered drill.

	Get me out of here and I'll take you down there.

	Too late. The 'dungeon' is cleaned out. It was the first place I checked, right after I sampled the gumbo. Bit heavy on the okra.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
But Rita isn't listening to the food review. Her mind's racing. Finally, the LOCK CLICKS and the cage door swings open. Gordon takes the distressed damsel in his arms, lifts her out.

West is lifted onto the back of a wagon. With the noose dangling in front of his nose, West addresses the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I have everyone's attention please. I think we've had a series of major misunderstandings and I'd like to take a moment to clear them up. First, the whole drumming on the boobies thing. In my native land, Africa, my ancestors used drums to communicate between villages. I'm sure y'all can see that this young girl here can communicate all the way down to Baton Rouge. Hell, on a clear day, we might even get Galveston. All I was saying was, 'How're you doing,' 'My name's Jim,' 'How's your mama?' Second misunderstanding. That redneck comment. I'm getting the sense that some of you took that negatively. You know, some of my best friends are whiskey-guzzling, pot-bellied rednecks just like y'all here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That slavery thing, I don't see what the big deal was. Hell, who wouldn't want somebody to run around for them doing chores. Are you going to get your big, fat, lazy ass out of bed every morning and pick your own damn cotton. I don't think so.

As she walks quickly away, West comes over, a haunted look on his face.

Suddenly there's a WHOOSH and Rita falls through the ceiling and plops in the chair just like West did earlier. He instinctively pulls his gun. Puts it away as Gordon muses about her anatomy.

West slides under the train! He lies flat as the death MACHINE ROARS over him. At the last second, he lassos the rope around the rear axle. It slows him for a beat... then stretches. He's gotten Gordon's trick rope. We see his silent scream -- "Artemus!" He slides way behind the tank/train, then springs back... past the tank/train. Finally, West slides back underneath and manages to grab hold of their caboose. He swings his legs up, pulls himself around onto the step.

Gordon grabs a rock and smashes West's collar. Suddenly --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ZIIIINNG! West's collar emits a LOW HUM. Suddenly, West is thrown into Gordon, their collars locking. CLANG!
</DIRECTION>
<GORDON>
<DIRECTION>
(suddenly calm)

	That's odd. What did you do?

<DIRECTION>
West lifts his leg to Gordon's collar to push him away, but then -- CLANG! The stiletto in his shoe dislodges and instantly sticks to Gordon's magnetic collar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For a mega-millisecond, West -- his foot stuck to his partner's neck -- is stunned. But before he knows what even happened, West flips upside down onto his shoulders.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you all right?

<WEST>

Gordon struggles to free the writhing West from the boot (attached to Gordon's collar).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, West's foot comes free. But when he sits up -- THWAP! His collar is sucked into Gordon's belt buckle. West is face to face with his partner's crotch.
</DIRECTION>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do me a favor. When you're telling this story to your grandkids, leave this part out.

West starts unbuttoning Gordon's belt.

<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, when I undo your belt, I'm going to run as fast as I can that way, and you run as fast as you can the other way. Understand?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<GORDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're going to run as fast as you can one way and I'm going to run as fast as I can the other...? Ingenious.

The men run in opposite directions. (Gordon's belt on West's collar, West's boot on Gordon's). They get about thirty, forty yards. Then --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They're yanked backwards into each other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SPLASH! They fall in the water -- back to back. Every time one rolls up and catches his breath, the other is under water.

	Aha. My auxiliary tool kit. I forgot all about it. It must've slipped out of my pocket.

<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why didn't you tell me you had an 'auxiliary' tool kit?

Gordon looks to the heavens and recites.

	You know, Gordon, you can be quite annoying -- flaunting that fancy education.

	Well, truth be told, I never had a fancy education -- not a formal one, anyway.

	The pinnacle of my life in the theater came in a production of Our American Cousin -- a light comedy -- at Ford's Theater in Washington. There was this one line I had... always got the biggest laugh in the show. One night, it drowned out the gunshot that killed President Lincoln.

</WEST>
<DIRECTION>
He points toward a small black wasp flying from above.
</DIRECTION>
<WEST>

	The desert wasp... one of the world's great hunters. She'll kill the tarantula -- and lay her eggs on it, so her babies can have something to eat.

	But I'm never gonna get there with you draggin' that damn thing around!

Now we see Gordon's got the heavy metal collar in his hand. West grabs him and they start to walk away -- Gordon listing noticeably.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	While a magneto of this power may not inspire your scientific curiosity, it does mine. Besides, you never know when it might come in handy.

Gordon suddenly disappears OUT OF FRAME. West stops to see what's happened to his partner now...

<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - GORDON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's on his back, arm holding the metal doughnut straight out over his head, being dragged across the desert floor by some unseen force.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordon snowplows backwards through the sand for 40 feet, finally coming to an abrupt stop with a metallic klang!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
West deadpans this bit of insanity, walks over, and with the toe of his boot, uncovers the explanation -- iron railroad tracks covered by drifting sand.

	Arte... when you're right, you're right.

	Jim, I know I've hallucinated it several times before, so is that really the Wanderer?

</GORDON>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the Wanderer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<DIRECTION>
Gordon seems relieved to know his beloved train is not another mirage. They continue on to the rim of the canyon, peer over the edge. Reacting to what they see...
</DIRECTION>
<GORDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And would it be too much to hope that I'm simply seeing a World's Fair down there... ?

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SPIDER CANYON - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Now they hear a strange sound. To modern ears, a WHINE as from a jet engine. Loveless appears in the f.g. He's rising on a steel platform as if on some unseen elevator. Up, up, up he goes... as now more of the contraption comes INTO VIEW. Alloy girders, multi-levels, control boards... all open in an Eiffel Tower-like effect.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
West and Gordon scramble for cover behind a rock as a giant metal Tarantula steps over the rim in full terrifying glory. Eight legs, five stories high.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The thorax of the giant spider bristles with Gatling guns and all manner of weaponry. As the shadow of the monster passes over their faces...
</DIRECTION>
<GORDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now that's impressive.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
West is dressing for battle. He straps his six guns on his hips, flips the pool table over, grabs a coach gun, tucks that behind his chaps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He belts on his shotgun shell bandolero. An extra six gun gets tucked in the belt. Another in his boot. Pocketfuls of shells. The man's ready for war.
</DIRECTION>
<WEST>

But Gordon won't be hurried. He has a big book out, studies it, then looks back to his Nitro-cycle.

The citizens flee. The detectives are not far behind them. The soldiers take cover and ready their weapons. Grant stands his ground... even as a huge FOOT CLOMPS down in front of him, VIBRATING the CAMERA.

West's body hasn't moved. The only change is that now a line of ants crawls across his face. We watch, hoping for a twitch, something... But there is none. The ants march over lifeless eyes, swarm onto the bloody cut on his head. If we're not convinced he's dead...

EXTREME CLOSEUP - WEST'S EYES

A shadow falls across them. But instead of the pecking red beak, a human hand appears IN the FRAME. Brushes the ants away. We hear an INDIAN INCANTATION over. Then finally... West's eyelids flutter open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WEST'S POV - NAVAJO SHAMAN

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON MAP OF "THE DE-UNITED STATES"

There have been some significant internal changes which Loveless now describes. The delegation from each country stands when they hear their name.

The place has been ransacked. The gun cabinets are empty, the Gatling lamp removed. All that's left is Gordon's Nitro-cycle and his wardrobe full of dresses.

<DIRECTION>
West tries every secret hiding place. Nothing. Finally he finds Gordon's belt buckle/derringer. He opens the breech. Only one dinky bullet. He throws down the belt in disgust.

	<DIALOGUE>
	My partner nations insist that we make this as legal as possible. Personally, I like the symmetry of it. After all wasn't it you who made us sign a surrender at Appomattox?

Loveless snaps his fingers. Amazonia drags Grant out of his seat and sticks a pen in his manacled hands.
</DIRECTION>
<PRESIDENT_GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never will I sign that paper, never will the United States ever surrender!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRESIDENT_GRANT>
<LOVELESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, sir, we're at loggerheads then, aren't we? And I suppose the threat of death to someone with your valorous war record, would mean nothing.

</LOVELESS>
<DIRECTION>
Grant sets his jaw intractably. He's right about that.
</DIRECTION>
<LOVELESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... so, if you still refuse to sign this surrender... we'll start by shooting your man, Gordon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOVELESS>

Loveless whirls, nods to Amazonia who drags the President back to his seat, pulls Gordon out of his. Rita can't help her outburst.
</DIRECTION>

Rita turns to Grant. What the hell is that? Gordon has no time to explain as Amazonia hauls him up on the stage. As Munitia aims her rifle... Gordon holds up a finger.
</DIRECTION>

	If I may have one request... it's that she aim at my heart... which has loved this great country so much!

Munitia cocks her rifle, then just as Loveless holds his hands up for the signal to fire... the lights dim...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOVELESS'S LAIR - AMPHITHEATER - DUSK

A candle-powered spotlight swings across the stage and illuminates... a deep-throated, bluesy black CHANTEUSE who starts singing the popular cathouse song, "Hangtown Gals."
</DIRECTION>
<CHANTEUSE>
<DIRECTION>
(singing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Ohhh... Hangtown gals are plump and rosy...'
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHANTEUSE>
<DIRECTION>
Loveless wheels his chair around to take a gander and forgets Gordon's execution instantly. And why not? She's young and beautiful in a RuPaul sort of way. About six feet tall, wearing the blue sequined number Gordon had in his dressing room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Accessorized with black mesh stockings, big feather boa, silver-buckled belt, lots of frilly petticoats for those can-can moves.
</DIRECTION>
<CHANTEUSE>
<DIRECTION>
(singing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Hair in ringlets, mighty cozy...'
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHANTEUSE>

She winds her finger around her ringlets and sticks out her derriere to the crowd. They stare, mouths agape at this piece of ass worthy of Othello.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Intrigued. Well, maybe more than intrigued.

He motions to hold up Gordon's execution, rolls to her.

Loveless hears this as an invitation, reaches out with his hand and whap! She slaps him right in the face.
</DIRECTION>
<CHANTEUSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'... And they'll sting like hornets!'
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHANTEUSE>
<DIRECTION>
There's a hush in the crowd. Loveless, a red handprint on his face, is a little nonplussed. Amazonia moves in threateningly, but Loveless stops her, starts to laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<LOVELESS>

(making her name up on the spot)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ebonia! Why are you so cruel to me?

Ebonia has escaped a head-cutting neck bracelet. But she probably shouldn't be teasing a man who's having "ghost aches" in certain amputated places.

	<DIALOGUE>
	'Hangtown gals are lovely creatures Think they'll marry Mormon preachers.'

She sashays over to the French dignitary, pulls his monocle out of his eye and blows hot breath on it, steaming it up. As she pops it back on his face...

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Heads thrown back to show their features...'

<DIRECTION>
Now she puts her cheek next to Rita as if matching their relative beauty while picking the pocket of Lippenreider.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rita pushes her away disgustedly but not before Ebonia hands Coleman the keys to the cuffs. Coleman looks from the keys to Ebonia. He just caught on.
</DIRECTION>
<COLEMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go, Ebonia, go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLEMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Then Ebonia prances on stage to Gordon, cuddles up to him. Gordon looks at the big beautiful black woman with a mixture of amusement and relief. Of course, it's his "I'd rather be dead" partner, Jim West.
</DIRECTION>

West/Ebonia wraps the feather boa around Gordon's neck -- hiding the derringer in the palm of his hand. Gordon looks worried. What's he going to do with a gun? As he tucks it up his sleeve...

<DIRECTION>
Immediately two FLAME THROWERS EXPLODE from his cone-like bosoms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maybe he should've listened about the dress. He turns to Gordon questioningly, and inadvertently incinerates one of Loveless's goons. He howls in pain, runs panicked... right into Rita.
</DIRECTION>
<RITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Serves you right for staring at them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RITA>
<DIRECTION>
As she relieves the charred goon of his keys... Loveless turns to the rest of his goons.

<DIRECTION>
(off their confused looks, points)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Him! Him! The girl!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOVELESS>
<DIRECTION>
Finally getting it, they rush Ebonia. Even his 4th of July breasts aren't a match for them. Desperate, West reaches way down in his undergarments to retrieve one of Gordon's billiard balls. He depresses the number and rolls it at the guards.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDON>

Gordon grabs West and Rita, pulls them behind the bar.

KA-BOOOOM! An EXPLOSION rips the place and a Santa Ana- sized fire starts immediately.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Meet me after the show!

Both West and Gordon look after her with yearning as three goons charge them. Coleman, amazed at their torpor, quickly grabs a RIFLE from the incinerated goon and OPENS FIRE. BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Three goons drop. Gordon and West exchange looks. Not bad for an emphysemic old engineer.

Speaking of the President... he's grabbed a dead goon's RIFLE, and is LAYING DOWN a pretty good field of FIRE himself. Suddenly, he gets a tap on the shoulder from behind. It's Amazonia. Whap, she sends a right to his chin knocking him out. She throws him over her shoulder and carries him away.

As fire engulfs the place, Loveless has no choice but to retreat... for now. Surrounded by a cadre of his women, who carry the unconscious President Grant, Loveless heads through a round STEEL VAULT DOOR. As Amazonia swings the door closed, the foreign dignitaries BANG on the door begging for admittance.

NEW ANGLE - GORDON'S DRAWING

It depicts a wing cutting through the air. Arrows indicating airflow. Circular lines indicating "life." Only one problem, it's upside down. Gordon remedies that. Looks sheepishly to West who, like him, is wearing a leather flight jacket and goggles.

<DIRECTION>
Now they attach the wing to the frame -- which is connected to the Nitro-cycle.

Coleman, his ever-present cigarette dangling from his mouth, readies bombs from the gunpowder of cartridges and Gordon's design. They look like Flash Gordon's spaceship. He passes them out.

Suddenly there's a LOUD WHOOOSH and...

West and Gordon swooping down low. West unfastens BOMBS from his vest, waits for the right moment. As they swing past the Tarantula cannon, he drops them. BOOM! BOOM! The big gun falls limp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TARANTULA - BRIDGE - DUSK

INT. BELLY OF THE BEAST - DAY

West plunges down into the metal chamber. Oiled pistons, thrusting. Steam, billowing. Struggles to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There, out of the shadows, steps...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KNIFE GUY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's a mess... no hands, just brass collars where they used to be. They lock eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, I guess you're the one who's gonna give me my whoopin'.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<DIRECTION>
They square off. A beat. Then, a long steely blade shoots out from where his left hand used to be.
</DIRECTION>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pfft. I got one a' those.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<DIRECTION>
West reveals the less impressive four inch stiletto in his boot. Knife Guy responds by producing another blade from his other cuff.
</DIRECTION>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you've got two of those.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, lemme talk to Gordon, I'll see if he can...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<DIRECTION>
No time for talk. Knife Guy does a bad-ass series of moves. The blades criss-crossing one another at blinding speed. West, unimpressed, retorts with a lame shake of his stiletto and boot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And the fight begins...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Knife Guy attacks! West narrowly escapes each thrust of the knife, and attempts a kick to the groin... but comes up short -- The stiletto collides with one of the blades and snaps like a carrot. His only weapon... gone.
</DIRECTION>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<DIRECTION>
West rolls onto the railing to avoid the attack. Sparks fly as the Knife Guy tries to slice and dice West but misses each time, hitting the metal railing instead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
West rolls to the floor, sucking air. Knife Guy lands a kick to West's ribs. And to make matters worse...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WRENCH GUY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
just showed up. He swings his wrench at West's head. West ducks but gets kicked in the back. He sails across the room, lands flat on his back. Now...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOVEL GUY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
makes an appearance. He hammers his shovel at West's groin, over and over. (West is in a crab position and backs up to avoid this.) West finally gets a kick in -- it does a moderate amount of damage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wrench Guy appears and swings his huge wrench at West's head. West escapes it, barely...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Knife Guy thrusts a side-kick at West's chest, but West catches his foot, holds on for dear life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wrench Guy is inbound, with wrench in hand. He swings on West, but West blocks it with Knife Guy's leg... OUCH! West punches both of them. Wrench Guy tumbles OUT OF FRAME.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
West stands. Looking for a way out, but... no luck... Shovel Guy attacks. West ducks and the shovel connects squarely with Knife Guy's blades. West crouches and throws two simultaneous punches, each connecting with a set of jewels.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
West stands, follows it up with a right cross and left hook and these two jokers wind up OUT OF FRAME.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now... the Wrench Guy is on his feet and he's pissed! He attacks West, lands a solid kick to the chest and West flies backward toward a...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HANGING CHAIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
which he grabs. He scales the gears, gets a solid grip, then swings, a huge arc across the room, gaining momentum, and kicks Shovel Guy and Wrench Guy at the same time! Off their feet they go, slamming onto the metal floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
West lands. Knife Guy attacks. West uses the chain to block the blades which are flying at him, left and right. Sparks fly. West manages to wrap the chain around one of the knives, locks it down, and heaves it into the gears... the blade snaps.
</DIRECTION>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No more Mister Knife guy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<DIRECTION>
West drops a stiff right-cross on the chin of the Knife Guy... wobbles his legs a bit. But before West can follow up...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER BLADE SHOOTS OUT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
to replace the broken one. It stops about a half-an-inch from West's nose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A struggle ensues, but West manages to wrap the chain around Knife Guy's neck and string him up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
West throws a kick to his back... Knife Guy, hanging by his neck, flies through the belly... (the chain is on a track)... and out of the mouth of the beast, down into the abyss, chain and all.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shovel Guy springs to his feet and swings on West. West grabs the shovel and they struggle for possession...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wrench Guy comes out of nowhere and wants a piece of the action. But West uses the shovel to deflect the swing- ing wrench... sparks fly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
West gains sole possession of the shovel and mule-kicks Shovel Guy OUT OF FRAME. West spins just in time to land a crippling blow to Wrench Guy's back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shovel Guy grabs the shovel. He and West tug-o'-war again. West ducks under the shovel and moves back-to-front with him. West elbows him in the ribs. He responds by putting West in a choke hold. West swings the shovel wildly but hits his target -- shovel Guy's head!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
West steps back, gets his footing and, for good measure, whacks him in the back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wrench Guy attacks. West defends himself with the shovel and lands a stiff kick to his stomach. Wrench Guy goes down...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
West turns, hits Shovel Guy in the chest with the shovel and he goes down...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wrench Guy sneaks up on West from behind and swings at his head. West, on instinct, lifts the shovel and blocks the deadly blow at the last second.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
West has now found his rhythm...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He swings and shovel and connects with... first, the foot, then the chin, and last but not least, the head -- BOINK! West drops the shovel and, World Wrestling Federation style, picks him up and hurls him into the space between the gears. We won't see him anymore!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
West pivots and WHACK!... Shovel Guy plants a neat little roundhouse kick squarely on West's jaw. West backs up and catches another in the stomach. Then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shovel Guy really shows what he's made of...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He does a series of jump-kicks, round-houses and fan- kicks into the air. All perfectly timed, all deadly.
</DIRECTION>

West, without missing a beat, steps on the shovel, which flips into his hand and -- WHACK! -- lands a clean one right on the top of Shovel Guy's melon.
</DIRECTION>
<WEST>

	</DIALOGUE>

Shovel Guy reels back and tumbles over the railing, through the hole and he's gone...

West casts the shovel out into the abyss.

West, exhausted, turns and sees...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
METAL HEAD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
all seven feet of him. The top of his head is a metal plate. Extending downward, encircling his eyes. West soaks him in, sighs.
</DIRECTION>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, I just threw my shovel out. So this really isn't fair. If you don't mind, I'd like to...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<DIRECTION>
West, at lightning speed, throws a sucker-punch/spin- ning back-fist to Metal Head's jaw... PING! That one really hurt... West's hand, that is. Metal Head isn't fazed a bit. West throws another shot, this time to the gut... PING! Then a kick to the groin... PING!!!
</DIRECTION>
<WEST>
<DIRECTION>
(incredulous)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Noooo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<DIRECTION>
Metal Head has had enough. He effortlessly picks West up by his lapels and flings him across the room. West tumbles, and lands right next to...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WRENCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He picks it up and starts swinging! A shot to the body ... PING! Then another... PING! Then another... PINGGGG! Metal Head lurches forward, absorbing each blow with not so much as a twitch of the eye. West furries... PING! PING! PING! PING!... nothing! He goes for the head... PINNNNNNGGGG!... nothing! West is out of time. He's been backed up as far as he can go. His heels are dangling over the mouth of the beast, a thousand feet above the rocky cliff.
</DIRECTION>
<WEST>

Metal head grunts, grimaces and pitches forward, toward West, slowly but menacingly... West braces himself.

West slowly gets up. Loveless is about to roll over him. He jumps up in the air, grabs onto an overhead strut, reverses and shoves the wheelchair off the ramp jamming the wheels.

A smile comes to West's face as he watches Loveless's frustrated attempts at going forward and backward.

Charging him. They smash into him, driving him to the rail. As they pummel him, trying to throw him over, Gordon realizes this is no time for passivity. He retaliates with a series of chops and kicks that would make West proud. Over the rail, goes Lippenreider. In that split-second before she drops, Gordon mouths "bye-bye."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Before he can savor the moment further, Amazonia clubs him from behind. Gordon whirls and hits her so hard it surprises them both. Over the railing she goes! As Amazonia hovers there, President Grant gives her the kick in the pants she needs to go sailing.

Whimpering pathetically, he uncouples his body from the useless contraption and slowly backs up to his wheelchair that's stuck against the railing.

The SHOTS almost blow the heels off West's boots. They PUNCTURE a PIPE behind him. Steam spews out. This is going to have an effect on something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TARANTULA BRIDGE - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordon and Grant are trying different combinations to stop the thing. Finally, Gordon throws up his hands. He doesn't know what else to try when suddenly the Tarantula seizes up as if it just had a heart attack and tilts forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CLIFF - EDGE - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Tarantula lurches forward drastically and teeter- totters on the brink.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TARANTULA - BELOW DECK - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sudden stopping jerks Loveless' wheelchair free. Despite his frantic efforts, he's rolling toward the opposite railing. When the wheelchair hits a pool of hydraulic fluid on the deck, it spins him around 180 degrees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
West jumps up, grabs a girder. The wheelchair spins under West's legs and then -- CLANK -- it slams into the railing and wedges there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CLIFF EDGE - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The impact makes the mighty beast jerk forward, inches away from toppling over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TARANTULA - BELOW DECK - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The jolt shoots West off the girder. He free-falls through the belly and out into the open air. Thinking quickly, he grabs onto the back of Loveless' wheel- chair. His arms nearly torn from their sockets. His weight causes the wheelchair to shift, now leaving it hanging on by a thread. West reaches out, grabs the wheel of the chair and hangs there.
</DIRECTION>
<LOVELESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle. How did we arrive in this dark situation?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOVELESS>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. Guess I'm stumped!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<LOVELESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I'm so cotton-pickin' afraid of heights. They just give me the spooks!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOVELESS>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, don't be afraid, Loveless. With this being the last leg of our journey and all, you should soak in the view, you're really missing something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<LOVELESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mister West, I'm gonna cut this conversation short...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOVELESS>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good one, Loveless. I didn't think of that one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<LOVELESS>
<DIRECTION>
(furious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mister West!!! I am faced with a difficult decision here. On one hand, there is the overwhelming love that I have for myself, and on the other, the raw, seething hatred I have for you! Now, I could kill you very easily, just by pulling this lever...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOVELESS>
<DIRECTION>
He moves the joystick. The chair jerks back.
</DIRECTION>
<LOVELESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But, of course, I would die along with you. I guess the only thing that I can take comfort in is the hope that you would hit those rocks a second before me and I could enjoy immeasurable bliss before I vanish.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(moving joystick back and forth)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What to do, what to do...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOVELESS>
<DIRECTION>
West grabs the joystick.
</DIRECTION>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Allow me to make that decision easy on you, Loveless. Because I want to see you dead a hell of a lot more than I want to live.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<LOVELESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why is it that I have a sneaking suspicion, that although you are as black as the night on the outside... inside, you are yellow?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOVELESS>
<DIRECTION>
They lock eyes. A beat.
</DIRECTION>
<LOVELESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't have it in you, do you... boy?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOVELESS>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were right. Let's cut this conversation short!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<DIRECTION>
West yanks the joystick back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - LOVELESS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
his eyes widen. The wheels spin for a second, finally catch, and in a flash, Loveless and West free-fall into space.
</DIRECTION>
<LOVELESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Weeeeeeeeeest!!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOVELESS>
<DIRECTION>
A beat, then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - CHAIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
which is dangling from the belly of the beast. At the bottom of the chain is the Knife Guy from the fight scene. West is hanging on to his ankles, enjoying a vindictive, belly laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<WEST>
<DIRECTION>
(downward)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now that looked like it hurt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PROMONTORY POINT - CLOSE ON GOLDEN SPIKE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's driven finally into place to a rousing cheer. PULL BACK to reveal that President Grant, his sleeves rolled up, has delivered the blow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hats in the air, handshakes, pictures. The specter of Loveless and his evil plot a fading memory.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grant turns to West and Gordon.
</DIRECTION>
<PRESIDENT_GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gentlemen, I now strongly believe the United States is going to be truly united. Not because of this railroad... but because of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRESIDENT_GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
Grant scans the crowd, every race seems present at this momentous event. He reaches into his pocket, takes out two silver shields.
</DIRECTION>
<PRESIDENT_GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've signed into law the creation of an agency whose sole duty is to protect the President and the country from lunatics like Loveless.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pins badges on their vests)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Welcome to the Secret Service, Agents No. 1 and No. 2.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRESIDENT_GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
The President shakes both their hands. Gordon resists looking down.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, just out of curiosity, sir... who's Agent No. 1?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDON>
<DIRECTION>
Grant just shakes his head, some things never change.
</DIRECTION>
<PRESIDENT_GRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think that matters very much, do you? Gordon? Besides, you'll have plenty of time to discuss it on your new assignment.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(hands them piece of paper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See you back in Washington.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRESIDENT_GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
He snaps off a salute, starts to go as they read it. Gordon looks up, very troubled.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But, sir... what about our train?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDON>
<PRESIDENT_GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
(over shoulder)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'm taking it of course. Hell, you let Loveless blow up mine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRESIDENT_GRANT>
<DIRECTION>
As they look at one another in dismay...
</DIRECTION>
<RITA>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jim... Arte...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RITA>
<DIRECTION>
They turn to see Rita approaching them from a crowd of scientists. She's looking extraordinarily fetching in a print dress and parasol.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
West and Gordon sit up like dogs.
</DIRECTION>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rita! You look great.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<GORDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ravishing, a vision.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDON>
<DIRECTION>
She hugs West, she hugs Gordon. Who's it gonna be?
</DIRECTION>
<RITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just wanted to thank you for everything you've done for me... before I went back home to Texas.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RITA>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Texas? Why're you going back there? Why don't you come with me back to Washington?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<GORDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or better still, come with me to Washington. I could introduce you to people I still know in the theater...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDON>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's not really an entertainer, remember?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<RITA>
<DIRECTION>
(intercedes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't go with either of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RITA>
<DIRECTION>
She looks from one crestfallen suitor to the other.
</DIRECTION>
<RITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not that you both don't have your attributes.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Gordon)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're so sophisticated and such a wonderful cook.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to West)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jim, you're good with a gun... and have great legs.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to both)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you're both so brave. But... I'm afraid I haven't been completely honest with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RITA>
<WEST_AND_GORDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh-oh...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST_AND_GORDON>
<RITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Professor Escobar's not my father. He's my husband.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RITA>
<DIRECTION>
She gestures to a handsome goateed Latino waiting for her. Shaved and cleaned up, he's not the old man we thought.
</DIRECTION>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rita... why didn't you just tell us that in the first place?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<RITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I was going to... but would you have really brought me along if I said I was married? Honestly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RITA>
<DIRECTION>
Neither West nor Gordon knows what to say.
</DIRECTION>
<RITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't think so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RITA>
<DIRECTION>
She turns and starts to walk away. Stops and smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<RITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At least you still have each other.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RITA>
<DIRECTION>
As West and Gordon look at one another...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MONUMENT VALLEY - SUNSET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We gaze out over one of those achingly beautiful John Ford vistas as we hear our heroes voices.
</DIRECTION>
<WEST>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, Arte...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<GORDON>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that, Jim?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDON>
<WEST>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe Rita's right...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly intruding into the f.g. is a huge metal leg. Then another LEG CLOMPS down... and the Tarantula comes INTO FULL VIEW. As our heroes ride slowly into the sunset.
</DIRECTION>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Besides... there's a lot of other women in the world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<GORDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's easy for you to say. She didn't walk off with your best dress.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDON>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
