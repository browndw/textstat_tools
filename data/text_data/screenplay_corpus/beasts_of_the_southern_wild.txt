	EXT. HUSHPUPPY'S HOUSE - DAWN
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
An abandoned looking trailer sits on top of two 15-foot-tall oil drums. Distant thunder trembles through the peeling metal panels. The structure is in such disrepair, that surely no one lives here.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But then, a light goes on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HUSHPUPPY'S HOUSE - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A tiny hand sculpts the mud on top of a crawfish hole placed on the floor. We pan up to reveal a little girl examining a baby chicken that appears to be dead. This is HUSHPUPPY, an unkempt and seemingly uncared for six-year-old with a gaze of unmistakable wisdom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hushpuppy places the chick on the crawfish hole, like a queen on her throne and the chick twitches to life, cheeps twice. Hushpuppy's esoteric science experiment is interrupted by DISTANT THUNDER. Her eyes stand to attention.

<DIRECTION>
An eerie, harsh wind whips hay and dust through over a giant slumbering pot-belly pig.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hushpuppy, donned in boys' underpants and a child-sized wife- beater, tip-toes behind the epic creature. She studies it, wonderful, is this the source of the thunder?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With the utmost delicacy, she lays a hand on the pig's belly. We hear his HUGE BEATING HEART.

EXT. HUSHPUPPY'S HOUSE - VARIOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A series of glimpses of Hushpuppy's scientific method. She chases geese, chickens, ducks, dogs around the property- a cross between an abandoned farm and salvage yard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hushpuppy grabs a baby chick and puts it to her ear. A TINY HEARTBEAT. She listens with focused wonder and intensity.

<DIRECTION>
A window made from a gas station sign opens in a Robinson Crusoe style tree house patched together from storm debris and discarded appliances.
</DIRECTION>

A wild man with severe features, a frazz of unkempt hair, and brawler's scars opens a window made from a metal sign. This is WINDELL EMMETT DOUCET, known to all as WINK (39).

We now see Wink in his morning ritual. He opens a cooler with a butchered chicken inside it and tosses the bird on the grill.

He goes to the front porch and pours down a bag of dog food.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hushpuppy devours the whole roast chicken with her hands, getting right in there like it was a candy apple. It looks really yummy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pigs, dogs, chickens, and cats are chowing down all around her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hatch opens above her and we realize we're in the bottom of the Shacko. Wink sticks his head through the hatch and throws corn to the chickens.
</DIRECTION>
<WINK>

Hushpuppy rips off a piece of chicken and flings it to a filthy chihuahua with no hair on the back half of its body. This is WINDELL, in spite of her circumstances, quite a handsome young pup.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BATHTUB MARSH WATER - THE TURCK - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDE, we see Hushpuppy and Wink drift through the marsh. They ride in a severed truck bed floating on top of oil drums. A motor is strapped to the back. A sign on the boat reads "The Turck", Hushpuppy's spelling of "Truck".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They look out to where the water goes all the way to a monolithic, 20 foot wall stretching infinitely into the distance. This levee, the first piece of modern construction we've seen, encloses the civilized world, protecting it from rising water. The Bathtub is on the wrong side of wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wink stares out at the distant factories behind the wall with a peaceful and confident disdain.

Hushuppy matches his relaxed defiant expression.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They stand on a long and crumbling road surrounded on both sides by water. The rag tag band of revelers charge forward WHOOPING and SHOUTING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hushpuppy kisses her hand and smacks the town sign. "Isle de Charles Doucet" is crossed out and someone has graffitied "The Bathtub." Each party-goer repeats Hushpuppy's kiss and smack in wild, ritualistic fashion.

EXT. LAFOURCHE ROAD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The townspeople charge in a rousing parade. Everyone drags trails of beer cans, boat parts, anything they can tie to themselves that makes a lot of noise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are the hard faces of fishermen and their feisty wives, downtrodden but with a sense of fortitude among them, a community of heart, spirit, passion, and reckless abandon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see none of the separations that we're used to in modern society. There is no evidence of politics, religion, class, race or any other divisive ideology. The Bathtub is a place of true and honest unity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Megaphones sticking out a gutted mini-van broadcast the Cajun band playing inside. Fiddle, saw, guitar, and double-bass players struggle to hold onto their instruments and the truck bounces them down a dirt road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They drive under a banner reading "Welcome to the Bathtub Storm Season!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wink and Hushpuppy rattle along on a float made from the front end of a pickup truck. Over the front cabin rears a giants sculpture of a horse-head made out of wooden spikes, metal plates, and heavy chains. Carnival-dressed maniacs clamber on top.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wink hollers and waves to people. He fires jets of beer into the mouths of the crowd.

Hushpuppy dances on the back of the float. Though she's the tiniest member of this very adult parade, she's right in the thick of everything. No one is checking I.Ds Here.

EXT. MARINA PAUPIER NET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wink opens his trawl net and dumps a massive catch into a picking pan. There's food to feed a hundred in the haul. No one is a bit fazed though, this is just your average night fishing in the Bathtub.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shrimp, crabs, and small leaping fish struggle over one another for dear life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hushpuppy helps him sort the catch. Winks's hands move with virtuosic ease, separating the crabs from the shrimp. She studies Wink's every move and tries to measure up to her Dad's proficiency. He doesn't demonstrate or explain anything, but we sense there is a system of education in place here.

Hushpuppy focuses in on a tiny fish, wriggling and sucking it's last breaths of air.

EXT. LADY JO'S CYPRESS FOREST - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Explosions everywhere as Bathtubers rampage blasting fireworks down the street instead of into the air. Men dressed as women, women dressed as men, in some kind of reckless esoteric ritual.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SCORE kicks in hard with a tinge of ominous forboding. We sense that in spite of the ecstatic energy, the unbridled joy, that a cloud hangs over this community. The people are parting like it's there last day on earth, and we feel viscerally, that it could be.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hushpuppy runs in the thick of it behind Wink waving a fountain sparkler. Wink trips and falls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wink lies on his back on the ground. He sees his daughter watching him, holding the huge sparkler, and they both laugh with sheer joy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hushpuppy stops over him and points a bottle rocket in his face, the fuse burning. He nods his approval. They watch the fuse burn down to the last moment. She turns it upward, and they watch her rocket join a sky filled with pluming mortars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hushpuppy looks at the light flickering across Wink's faces. He's momentarily peaceful, admiring the spectacular display.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hushpuppy smiles at him with pride. He doesn't see her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They run off into the crowd, which is pulsating at the pinnacle of mayhem. The OMINOUS MUSIC shifts gears into a BLASTING PATRIOTIC HYMN of the Bathtub. Throw your fist in the air! These are the survivors, those who fight for their joy and their history to the last man.

On Wink's chest, surrounding his heart, a corroded spider web of purple bruises shows through the skin, like varicose veins covering his entire heart.

<DIRECTION>
Wink, younger and prettier, naps in an uncharacteristically colorful lawn chair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LOW, GURGLING GROWL wakes him up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There in the yard, crawling slow and lazy, is a massive 15- foot alligator, breathing the heavy, slutty way alligators breathe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A topless woman steps in front. Sweat beading on her perfect shoulder blades, down her perfect, back ending in a pair of boys' underpants- just like Hushpuppy's.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Throughout Hushpuppy's vision, we never see Marietta's face, it's always covered, shot from the back, or out of frame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marietta cocks the shotgun with one hand, Terminator 2 style.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lowers it on the gator...

Hushpuppy rows the Turck through the flooded Bathtub by herself. In the distance she sees a lone horse. It stands on an tiny island of land, the last high ground in an endless stretch of water.

The girls are huddled against each other, terrified, hungry, and alone.

In Wink's POV- Joy, Tee-Lou, Lizard, and the rest of Bathsheba's original school class play in a room with a BABYSITTER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She tickles Hushpuppy, who has been given new clothes and looks like a normal little girl for the first time. Her boots and boys underpants have been traded for a delicate blue dress. The image is jarring.

</BABYSITTER>
<DIRECTION>
Hushpuppy's eyes meet Wink's and she freezes at his horrifying appearance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wink grabs a sofa trying to stop the wheelchair as it rolls by. His fingers slips off, too weak to hold on. He tries to scream and nothing but a SEDATED MOAN comes out of his mouth. He tries to pull the tubes out of his arm.

She sees two orderlies force pills into Wink's mouth. He's regaining his strength and is able to hold them off momentarily before submitting, and going limp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hushpuppy bolts, unable to take it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We stay in the room as the orderlies walk away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wink peeks to make sure they're gone, then spits his pills on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wink stares at the ceiling for a long beat. Then, with a burst of energy he grabs his morphine drip and topples himself onto the floor. He pulls his wires out.

Across the parking lot they go in a spree of euphoria, coming to a halt around Wink.

<DIRECTION>
The Bathtub crew carries Wink through the entrance to town. His arms slug over Walrus and Jean Battiste, he's barely able to help walk.

We sense from the weary faces and silent eyes that it's been a long journey home.

Everyone goes in except Hushpuppy who stops outside the door as they lay him down in convulsions. She stays and tries to watch.

Wink tries to say something to Walrus and can't. Blood bubbles out of his mouth. Wink catches Hushpuppy's eye then looks away as fast as he can.

Reeling, but steady, Hushpuppy backs out the door.

Now with her three friends, she tip-toes past several humongous footprints up to a gruesome fox carcass. Something gigantic has ripped open its stomach and gutted it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She leans over, unafraid, trying to understand it's meaning. Flies swarm and nibble, their movement almost elegant. Seen in close up, the gory mess has a strange beauty to it.

EXT. DARDAR RIDGE - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The beacon blinks out on the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hushpuppy stares towards it. The children are gathered behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Something has changed in her eyes. The eerie calm has given way to a hardened determination. Though unclear to us, her internal path of action is certain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She takes a deep breath, and lets out a WARRIOR CRY. She runs straight into the water with her girl gang charging behind her.

<DIRECTION>
Hushpuppy looks up to see SERGEANT MAJOR (60) -

<DIRECTION>
A big, timeless looking man with a salt and pepper moustache, saunters up to the rail. He stares down, examining these runts with an air of suspicion.

They let this thought settle, then Hushpuppy turns her swivel chair back toward the water
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The beacon appears through the mist. Hushpuppy's eyes go wide.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they approach, another boat comes into view. A half- sunken barge that looks as though its been rusting in the same position for a century. As we move in we see a lit up sign: "Elysian Fields Floating Catfish Shack GIRLS GIRLS GIRLS."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT./INT. ELYSIAN FIELDS - ENTRANCE - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hushpuppy, Joy, Tee-Lou, and Lizard disembark onto the barge with Sergeant Major following behind. They circle around a hatch in the floor with light pulsing out of it. Far-away JAZZ echoes up from the bowels of the ship. They look to each other in wonder.
</DIRECTION>

INT. ELYSIAN FIELDS - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hushpuppy descends a ladder into a glimmering wonderland. Christmas lights swallow the ceiling, and a light smoke facade encompasses everything. We feel like we're looking at a portal into the past, a Belloq-esque turned New Orleans Jazz parlor. The regulars are all oil-workers wooing their ladies of the night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a stage with a DJ and two singers, karaokeing along with "Until the Real Thing Comes Along" by Fats Waller.

Women descend on the kids who recoil, not knowing what to do with all this affection. Joy Strong puts up her fists.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hushpuppy pushes through the crowd nonplussed by the flurry of doting ladies. They are not who she is looking for. They are not who she is looking for.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She scans pictures of strippers through the ages pasted up all over the ceiling, each of them with a bra hung on it, none of them right.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bar patrons nod and tip their glasses to her as she passes, ladies smile and return to their drinks, drunk flirtatious dancers giggle at her, but she remains unfazed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches two swinging doors that lead to the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hushpuppy stops. Sniffs. Heaven.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SLOW MOTION: in Hushpuppy's POV, smoke curls through the swinging doors, the light illuminating the dust particles. It's a magic kitchen. Her POV tilts down to the floor where a pair of well-pedicured feet in flip-flops walks towards the swinging doors. They open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hushpuppy holds her breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A gorgeous COOK (35) wearing a baseball cap and an apron comes out the double doors. She wipes some sweat off her brow. She watches the band and kills a bottle of ice-cold beer.

With the smooth fanfare of a circus performer, The Cook lifts an egg, opens a beer bottle with her teeth, SPITS the cap at the egg and it cracks over the grits.

Hushpuppy's face is joy beyond all measure. She watches the Cook's flying hands, she prepares everything in a single motion, it's like a dance. She slaps a fresh alligator tail on the table and begins sawing through the scales.

INT. ELYSIAN FIELDS - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Magic soars as the couples rock back and forth on the dance floor. Strippers cradle their dates. It's all very sweet and tender. This seems to be the M.O of this strip club, slow-dance not pole-dance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The kids are each dancing with a stripper, glowing with love. They are orphans in a heaven of mothers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We float back to Hushpuppy, the camera dances with her and the Cook.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Cook squeezes Hushpuppy and spins her. Each time we catch their face their eyes are wetter and wetter.

INT. ELYSIAN FIELDS - DANCEFLOOR - NIGHT

Back in reality Hushpuppy gathers herself. She's suddenly not hugging back, just being held.

<DIRECTION>
Hushpuppy cups her hand to the Cook's ear and whispers something inaudible.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Cook squeezes her tight, seeming on the verge of adopting her. But she can't. She spins Hushpuppy around and around, then puts her down withouth meeting her gaze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hushpuppy watches her disappear into the crowd of swaying couples.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All goes quiet, and we sit behind Hushpuppy's head, a sea of light like a crown around her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MUSIC SWELLS. Decisively, with the force of a charging general, Hushpuppy turns and runs toward camera.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DEAD OAK RIDGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MATCH CUT to Hushpuppy leading Joy, Tee-Lou, and Lizard across a ridge dotted with Dead Oak trees, she's come back to the Bathtub.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DEAD OAK RIDGE - WATER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The camera moves over the water, past the dead oaks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We turn the corner past a stretch of marsh, and come upon the Aurochs, four of them, now suddenly and viscerally in the landscape of the Bathtub, swimming steadily toward solid land.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Bathtub crew sits by Wink's bed. His eyes are open, but everyone is silently waiting for the inevitable.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ARK WRECKAGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The children crest the ridge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The RUMBLE of Aurochs hoofs is suddenly and violently audible.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hushpuppy turns. She catches a glimpses of something massive moving behind the distant oaks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The kids turn and hustle down the ridge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hushpuppy, Joy, Tee-Lou, and Lizard hustle down hill with increased urgency. The DISTANT TRAMPLING is growing louder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind Hushpuppy the dark shapes of the Aurochs crest the ridge in a deafening STAMPEDE. Joy, Tee-Lou, and Lizard scream and sprint out in front of Hushpuppy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hushpuppy walks steadily forward, refusing to run. Her face locked with determination, she is unafraid. Her eyes shoot toward the shacko.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wink, with all his strength looks toward Hushpuppy, their eyes meet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In Wink's POV, Hushpuppy stops dead on the bridge, waiting for her fate, staring toward her father.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ARK WRECKAGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Aurochs bear down on Hushpuppy from behind, their footsteps rattling the frame. They grow inconceivably large, the camera has to tilt to hold the frame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hushpuppy balls her fists and stands her ground. Suddenly, she turns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Aurochs ROARS. Then, inches away from Hushpuppy, she stops. She SNORTS, blowing Hushpuppy's hair back. Hushpuppy doesn't flinch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Aurochs stares face to face with Hushpuppy. Sniffs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wink is frozen in wonder, unable to believe his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ARK WRECKAGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hushpuppy raises her chin in confident defiance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now in full profile, we see the Aurochs towering 15-feet tall, she takes a step forwards, sniffs again. A low SNORT, or is it a purr?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Aurochs lowers her head with respect.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her eyes well with emotion, recognizing one of her own. A ferocious warrior.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Aurochs steps back, takes a knee, and with a BELLY FLOP that rattles the very earth, she lays down. Her three companions follow suit, their fat tummies settling into an almost joyful, lazy, repass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A strange calm has settled over Hushpuppy. Almost a smile, but more of a peace and an affection for her equal. They're both children in their way.
</DIRECTION>
<HUSHPUPPY>

	You're my friend, kind of.

With weary and clumsy steps, the Aurochs stand and retreat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hushpuppy approaches the shacko. It's like walking the plank, but she's unafraid, at one with her destiny.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Bathtub crew look on her in awe. They part ways to let her pass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches the door, steeling her reserve.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hushpuppy opens the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wink is curled up on Hushpuppy's bed-- very, very thin. His eyes are closed. His chest heaves up and down in short violent breaths. Hushpuppy stands and stares.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wink looks at Hushpuppy in reverence. He knows it's the last time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wink motions for her to come closer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hushpuppy inches toward him. It takes all of her might. She sits on his bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hushpuppy takes her to-go container from Elysian Fields out of a paper bag and pops it. She unwraps a gator nugget, dips it in hot sauce, and holds it out for Wink to take a bite.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hushpuppy watches as Wink chews weakly. She eats one herself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wink and Hushpuppy draw it out. They don't want it to end. It takes a full minute for him to swallow the first bite, and she paces herself to finish when he does.
</DIRECTION>

	</DIALOGUE>
</HUSHPUPPY>
<DIRECTION>
Hushpuppy's face hardens, and even as the tears fall, we see a strength and composure that only Wink could have put there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She falls into his arms and he embraces her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hushpuppy squeezes Wink. She does not let go. She stays strong.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wink's hand trembles on her back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She holds him as his deep, warm, heartbeat slows, slows, and stops. His weight slumps over her. She keeps on holding him, but she knows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GRAVEYARD BY THE WATER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Steadfast, Hushpuppy holds a torch on the edge of the Bathtub. The Turck, piled with branches, floats in front of her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She lowers the flame and lights a cloth covering Wink's body aflame. She pushes the funeral pyre out into the current. We watch the boat flames drift into the foreground, covering Hushpuppy face with flames. She looks into them in all her grief and wisdom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The group begins a funeral prayer, playing quiet in the background as Hushpuppy contemplates the pyre.

	A ship at my side starts her motors and sails for the gulf. I watch her until she disappears. "There! She's gone!" Gone where? Gone from my eyes, that's all. She's just as big as when she left me. And somewhere else, other voices are calling out, "Here she comes!" And that is dying.

Hushpuppy gazes into the sparks leaping off the top of the fire are foregrounded in front of Hushpuppy, particles of Wink jumping into the sky. HORNS ENTER, droning low, and building into an funeral dirge.

The Turck almost disappears over the horizon. The HORNS take a hopeful turn, the melancholy of the dirge mixing with the anthem of the Bathtub.

We CUT WIDE to reveal that the water is rising and washing over the road. Our heroes are marching on the final sliver of land. The camera flies backwards, and our view of the road disappears into mist and churning waves. They appear to be walking on water.

Hushpuppy leads them forward, into the future.

CUT TO BLACK.
