	INT. BASEMENT - EVENING
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A NAKED LIGHTBULB SPARKS TO LIFE. It dangles from the ceiling of a basement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LIGHT, QUICK FOOTSTEPS AS ANNA CROWE moves down the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna is the rare combination of beauty and innocence. She stands in the chilly basement in an elegant summer dress that outlines her slender body. Her gentle eyes move across the empty room and come to rest on a rack of wine bottles covering one entire wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She walks to the bottles. Her fingertips slide over the labels. She stops when she finds just the right one. A tiny smile as she slides it out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna turns to leave. Stops. She stares at the shadowy basement. It's an unsettling place. She stands very still and watches her breath form a TINY CLOUD IN THE COLD AIR. She's visibly uncomfortable.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna Crowe moves for the staircase in a hurry. Each step faster than the next. She climbs out of the basement in another burst of LIGHT, QUICK FOOTSTEPS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE HEAR HER HIT THE LIGHT SWITCH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE LIGHTBULB DIES. DRIPPING BLACK DEVOURS THE ROOM.
</DIRECTION>

INT. DINING ROOM - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two place settings are arranged on the living room coffee table. Take-out Chinese food sits half eaten on good china. An empty bottle of red wine sits between boxes of Chinese food.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna arrives with the backup bottle and is now wearing a sweater. She hands a collegiate rowing team sweatshirt to Malcolm.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's getting cold.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
MALCOLM CROWE sits on the floor at the coffee table, his vest and tie on the sofa behind him. A jacket and an overcoat lay on a brirfcase next to him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm is in his thirties with thick, wavy hair and striking, intelligent eyes that squint from years of intense study. His charming, easy-going smile spreads across his face. He points.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's one fine frame. A fine frame it is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm points to the HUGE FRAMED CERTIFICATE propped up on a dining room chair. It's printed on aged parchment-type paper. The frame is a polished mahogany.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He slips on the sweatshirt.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How much does a fine frame like that cost, you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Anna hands the backup bottle over to Malcolm.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've never told you... but you sound a little like Dr. Seuss when you're drunk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm uncorks the wine and starts pouring in the empty glass.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anna, I'm serious. Serious I am, Anna.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Anna giggles. She's clearly buzzed herself. Malcolm doesn't get it. Anna takes a few calming sips of her wine. Her attention slowly moves to the framed certificate.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mahogany. I'd say that cost at least a couple hundred. Maybe three.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Three? We should hock it. Buy a C.D. rack for the bedroom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know how important this is? This is big time.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to read it for you, doctor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do I really sound like Dr. Seuss?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Anna ignores Malcolm and clears her throat. She leans forward her seat and reads the certificate out loud as Malcolm tries to tickle her.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In recognition for his outstanding achievement in the field of child psychology, his dedication to his work, and his continuing efforts to improve the quality of life for countless children and their families, the City of Philadelphia proudly bestows upon its son Dr. Malcolm Crowe... That's you... the Mayor's Citation for Professional Excellence.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. The power of the words sobers the two of them.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow. They called you their son.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can keep it in the bathroom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Anna turns to Malcolm. He smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not real, Anna. Some secretary wrote that up. Don't tell me you thought it was real?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Anna's expression becomes serious.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
She just keeps staring. Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't do the quiet thing. You know I hate it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is an important night for us. Finally someone is recognizing the sacrifices you made. That you have put everything second, including me, for those families they're talking about.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm plays softly with her face. Anna takes his hands and holds them steady.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're also saying that my husband has a gift. Not an ordinary gift that allows him to hit a ball over a fence. Or a gift that lets him produce beautiful images on a canvas... Your gift teaches children how to be strong in situations where most adults would piss on themselves.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I believe what they wrote about you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
Anna lets go of his hands. Anna's eyes are emotional. Malcolm smiles softly.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Anna leans towards him. They hold each other tight. Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are we hugging about again?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Anna laughs as she wipes her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing. There wasn't supposed to be any crying at this celebration. Just a lot of drinking and sex.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm's charming, easy-going smile returns.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would like some red wine in a glass.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Anna hands him his glass. He stares at it.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would not like it in a mug. I would not like it in a jug.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm looks at Anna surprised at what he said. They crack up laughing. THEIR SWEET LAUGHTER FILLS THE HOUSE.
</DIRECTION>

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO GIGGLING SHADOWS APPEAR IN THE BEDROOM DOORWAY. They try to turn on the light. It doesn't come on.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bulb's out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Anna giggles some more as Malcolm's shadow stumbles across the bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MALCOLM TURNS ON THE BATHROOM LIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SHAFT OF LIGHT falls on Anna as she stands in the corner of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna smiles playfully and pulls off her sweater. She sways to a pretend striptease song.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm can't hold back his grin. He joins in -- slowly peeling off the sweat-shirt. He looks back to Anna. She's stopped her playful dance. She's facing away from him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks towards her. HIS GRIN QUIETLY DISAPPEARS. Malcolm's face turns to rock as his attention is drawn to the SHATTERED WINDOW in their bedroom. The wind moves through the room. A lamp lays broken on the ground by the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm kneels down. Beat. Anna's eyes fill with a quiet awareness.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's still in the house.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
A SHADOW FROM THE BATHROOM FLATS OVER BOTH OF THEM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANNA SCREAMS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm spins around. His heart stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm and Anna stare at the bathroom doorwary. They know someone is inside. Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm slowly starts towards the door. The first thing that comes into view are the clothes on the bathroom floor. Then the figure of a man comes into view. A STRANGER stands bare chested in the back of the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NO ONE MAKES A SOUND.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The STRANGER is about nineteen. Drugged out. Pitch black eyes bulging. His body is covered in scars and bruises. His hands are folded in front of him. He shakes ever so slightly. He has a patch of white in his hair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm speaks in a very calm voice. Never takes his eyes off the stranger.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anna, don't move. Don't say a word.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Anna barely nods her understanding.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
(to the stranger)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is forty-seven Locust Street. You have broken a window and entered a private residence. Do you understand what I'm saying?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
The stranger slowly looks up for the first time. His eyes lock on Malcolm.
</DIRECTION>
<STRANGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't know so many things.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRANGER>
<DIRECTION>
Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are no needles or prescription drugs of any kind in this house.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
The stranger suddenly comes forward into the doorway. Malcolm stumbles back onto the edge of the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna sees the stranger for the first time. Her face drains of color.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The stranger looks at Malcolm. He half grins.
</DIRECTION>
<STRANGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you drunk?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRANGER>
<DIRECTION>
The stranger's stare slides to Anna.
</DIRECTION>
<STRANGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you get him drunk?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRANGER>
<DIRECTION>
The stranger gazes at Anna. Gazes directly into her eyes. A penetrating, unwavering stare.
</DIRECTION>
<STRANGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know why you're scared when you're alone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRANGER>
<DIRECTION>
Anna's expression instanly changes.
</DIRECTION>
<STRANGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRANGER>
<DIRECTION>
BEAT. THE ROOM GOES SILENT.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you want? I don't understand what you want.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
The stranger turns and glares at Malcolm.
</DIRECTION>
<STRANGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What you promised.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRANGER>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm stops all movement.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--My God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--Do I know you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<STRANGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's all celebrate, Dr. Malcolm Crowe. Recipient of awards from the Mayor on the news. Dr. Malcolm Crowe, he's helped so many children... And he doesn't even remember my name?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRANGER>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm can't speak. Beat. The stranger's face starts to tremble.
</DIRECTION>
<STRANGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was ten when you worked with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRANGER>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. Malcolm's intelligent eyes race for answers.
</DIRECTION>
<STRANGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Downtown clinic? Single parent family?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had a possible mood disorder...

	<DIALOGUE>
	I had no friends... you said I was socially isolated.

<DIRECTION>

	You were wrong.

<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, clear your head... Male, nine... Single parent... Mood discorder... Acute anxiety.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRANGER>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm looks like someone hit him with a sledgehammer.
</DIRECTION>
<STRANGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm nineteen. I have drugs in my system twenty-four hours a day... I still have no friends. I still have no peace. I'm still afraid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRANGER>
<DIRECTION>
Tears jump into the stranger's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<STRANGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I'm still afraid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRANGER>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm stands.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please give me a second to think.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm's shaking hands touch his mouth as he stares at the stranger. Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bed Freidken?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<STRANGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some people call me freak.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRANGER>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Ronald... Ronald Sumner?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Tears fall down the stranger's face.
</DIRECTION>
<STRANGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am a freak.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRANGER>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm looks up at the sound of those words. Something clicks in his head.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--Vincent?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
THE ROOM GOES SILENT AGAIN.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vincent Gray?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
VINCENT GRAY stares with surprise through his tears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm lets out a deep breath like he just emerged from deep waters.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do remember you, Vincent. You were a good kid. Very smart... Quiet... Compassionate... Unusually compassionate...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Vincent's eyes burn at Malcolm.
</DIRECTION>
<VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You forgot cursed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINCENT>
<DIRECTION>
VINCENT is fully crying now.
</DIRECTION>
<VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You failed me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINCENT>
<MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
(whispers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vincent... I'm sorry I didn't help you... I can try to help you now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Vincent turns to the sink. His hand goes in. He turns arund and raises a gun at Malcolm. He FIRES. A VIOLENT, EAR-SHATTERING ECHO. Malcolm clutches his stomach and folds like a rag doll onto the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vincent instantly moves the gun to his own head. ANOTHER HORRIFIC BLAST SPIKES THE AIR. Vincent crumples onto the bathroom floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANNA'S CHILLING SCREAMS FILL THEIR HOME.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BENCH - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The legend, "Two Years Later" appears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A man flips open a worn file folder on his lap. Handwritten notes fill every line. At the top of the first page reads, "Vincent Gray, age 10, Referred January 19, 1989."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man's hand touches the name almost reverently.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He glances through the page. Words and phrases are circled throughout the file.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"...Acute anxiety" "...Socially isolated" "...Possible mood disorder" "...Parent status -- Divorced" "...Communication difficulty between mother-child dyad"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man's hands flip the page. At the top of this new page reads, "Cole Sear, age 8, Referred September 1998."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the man's fingers move through the notes we again see words and phrases circled throughout this new case history.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"...Acute anxiety" "...Socially isolated" "...Possible mood disorder" "...Parent status -- Divorced" "...Communication difficulty between mother-child dyad"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hands close the notepad. The hands are slightly shaking now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE PULL BACK to reveal the shaking hands belong to Dr. Malcolm Crowe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm sits on a sidewalk bench facing a row of brownstone homes across the street. He gazes blankly at the brownstones. Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A door opens. Malcolm is brought out of his trance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLE SEAR steps out his front door. Cole is a munchkin of a boy with large, black eyes that seem to take in everything around him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His hair is dark, with a small patch of jet white on the side. Cole carefully locks the door behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He moves to the bottom of the stairs and looks around nervously. Anxiously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The eight-year-old child reaches into his pocket and slips on a pair of VERY LARGE GLASSES. They look comical on him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm rises to his feet. He smooths out his shirt. Looks down and buttons his jacket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When he looks up, Cole is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm barely catches a glimpse of the boy. Cole runs at full speed down the street and turns the corner. TINY SNEAKERS SCREECHING ON THE SIDEWALK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For a second, Malcolm doesn't react. The second passes. He stuffs the file in his bag and starts running too.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm hauls down the sidewalk. He comes to a hard stop at a street intersection. Searches. Spots Cole running into a parking lot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLE sprints across the empty lot and reaches the doors of a building. He has to use all his strength to push open the highly ornate doors. He slips inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm jogs into the parking area. His pace slows to a walk and then to stillness as he gazes up at the building. Its old stone and huge towers make it stand out from the modern buildings all around it. Malcolm stares up at the historic Philadelphia church quietly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SHOOTING PAIN PIERCES HIS SIDE. Malcolm's hand goes to it quickly. He waits for it to pass before starting for the ornate doors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHURCH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Only a few people sit and pray in the sea of oak pews.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm scans the majestic room and finds what he's looking for in the last row of the church.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He moves down the center aisle towards the back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm finds Cole playing in his pew with a set of green and beige plastic soldiers. Cole makes the soldiers talk to each other.
</DIRECTION>
<COLE>
<DIRECTION>
(soft)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pro... Fun... Add...
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<DIRECTION>
The words are unintelligible.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cole senses someone. He looks up and sees Malcolm staring at him. The boy immediately goes white. Every cell of his body still with fear.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay, Cole. Don't be frightened.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Cole stays rigid. Hands clutching a handful of plastic riflemen.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My name is Dr. Malcolm Crowe. I was supposed to meet you today. Sorry I missed our appointment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm waits for a response. None comes.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you mind if I sit down? I have this injury from a couple of years ago and it flares up every once in a while just so I won't forget it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. Cole slowly slides down the pew, giving Malcolm most of the seat. Malcolm sits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cole fidgets with his soldiers. Beat. Malcolm looks over and stares at Cole's glasses. He leans forward to inspect them more carefully.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your eye frames. They don't seem to have any lenses in them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<COLE>
<DIRECTION>
(soft)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're my dad's. The lenses hurt my eyes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I knew there was a sound explanation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm returns to staring at his lap. Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was that you were saying before with your soldiers? Day pro fun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...De profundis clamo ad te domine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm stares surprised.
</DIRECTION>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's called Latin. It's a language.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm nods at the information.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All your soldiers speak Latin?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, just one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm smiles at Cole. His eyes drift down to Cole's arms. Malcolm's smile slowly disappears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cole's arms are covered in TINY CUTS AND BRUISES. Some almost healed. Some fresh. Malcolm looks around to gather himself. Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like churches, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In olden times, in Europe, people used to hide in churches. Claim sanctuary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Cole looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What were they hiding from?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, lots of things, I suppose. Bad people for one. People who wanted to imprison them. Hurt them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing bad can happen in a church, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm studies Cole's anxious face.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm and Cole just stare at each other.
</DIRECTION>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I forgot your name.

</COLE>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Crowe.

</MALCOLM>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a doctor. What kind?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I work with young people who might be sad or upset or just want to talk. I try to help them figure things out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you a good doctor?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got an award once. From the Mayor.

</MALCOLM>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Congratulations.

</COLE>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.

<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not even little ones that aren't supposed to hurt?

	No.

</MALCOLM>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's good.

Cole pockets his soldiers and rises from his pew.
</DIRECTION>
<COLE>

Cole turns and starts to the rear of the church. Malcolm loses himself in his thoughts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When Malcolm looks back, he sees Cole stop by the exit doors and take a tiny STATUE OF JESUS off the back table. Cole pockets the statue and quietly leaves the church.

Malcolm just sits and stares.

</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
He stops before a pile of mail collecting on a thin table. He stares at it blankly. Almost every envelope has "Over Due" or "Final Notice" stamped on it.

INT. BEDROOM - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm quietly walks into his bedroom. Only A READING LIGHT IS ON. THE SOFT LIGHT FALLS ON ANNA AS SHE SLEEPS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm moves to her side. The sight of her stops him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stares at his wife...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She huddles under a blanket, a wad of tissues in her hand. He takes it in silently.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes move to her face... One wisp of hair falls over her soft lips. OUTLINED IN THE SOFT READING LIGHT, Anna Crowe truly looks like an angel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm forms a tiny smile.

INT. HALL - NIGHT

Malcolm turns and moves for a narrow door in the hallway.

INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The empty basement is no longer empty. It's piled with file cabinets and boxes of psychology and medical books. A desk sits in the corner next to the wine racks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room still feels unsettling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm hunches over one of the books. Rifles through a stack of dusty books. Pulls out a thick text.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The spine of the text reads, "The Meridian Latin Dictionary."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm sits back at his desk and opens Cole's file. Handwritten on the first page are the words,
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"De profundis calms ad te, domine"
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm starts working through the Latin text. As he comes to each word, he jots it down underneath the Latin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm translates the last word.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stares quietly at the paper. The new words reads...
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Out of the depths, I cry to you Lord."

Old Philadelphia awakens... For a moment, it's like we're back in time.

A golden sun dances on the waters of Penns Landing. Historical old ships sit docked in its harbor... The dark bronze surface of the Liberty Bell reflects the dawn... A majestic Independence Hall stands watch as its city begins to stir... A thirty foot statue of Ben Franklin makes a proud silhouette against the morning sky...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AND THEN 1997 COMES CRASHING IN.

FLUORESCENT HOUSE LIGHTS COME ON IN WINDOWS... Jeeps and hatchbacks start roaming the cobblestone streets... Neon restaurants signs flicker to life... Traffic helicopters make their rounds... CAR ALARMS PIERCE THE AIR.

INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hand turns off a radio, shutting off the morning news.

<DIRECTION>
A small dog with two different colored eyes sticks his head out of the dryer, where he plays with the newly-dried clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LYNN SEAR reaches in and pulls out a blouse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She shakes it in the air and slips it on as she dresses hurriedly for work.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lynn is a woman in her late twenties. One hundred percent South Philly. Hair teased. She chews on an early morning piece of Trident. Under all of it, Lynn Sear is an attractive and sweet-looking young woman.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lynn enters THE KITCHEN through a swinging door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bowl of cereal and milk sit on a table in an empty kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lynn stares at a handful of kitchen CABINETS and DRAWERS that are open.

Lynn shakes her head.

</LYNN>

She closes them one at a time before moving to the coffee machine.

Lynn shivers a little. She leans over the thermostat and raises the heat. She returns to her post at the coffee machine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TINY FOOTSTEPS.

Lynn turns to see Cole standing in his private school uniform.
</DIRECTION>
<LYNN>

Lynn walks over to Cole. Checks his tie.
</DIRECTION>
<LYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got a spot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYNN>
<DIRECTION>
Lynn unclips the tie. Cole takes a seat at the kitchen table as Lynn walks back into the laundry room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dog is gone now. Lynn reaches into the dryer, digging for a new tie. She finds one, then turns and steps back into the kitchen and SCREAMS AT THE TOP OF HER LUNGS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Every cabinet and every drawer is wide open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cole sits at the kitchen table. His hands are pressed flat on the tabletop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks shaken.

Neither says anything for a beat.

Cole turns to see Lynn holding the pop tarts. He walks back and takes them from her before leaving.

Beat. Lynn glances to the kitchen table. Her gaze stops on the TWO TINY HAND PRINTS OF SWEAT formed on the table's surface.

TOMMY TAMMISIMO is a tough-looking, eight-year-old Italian kid who waits at the bottom of Cole's brownstone stairs in his school uniform.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cole emerges from the brownstone and moves down the steps. Lynn's face appears in the kitchen window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two boys begin their walk down the street to school. Tommy puts his arm around Cole. Lynn waves. Cole waves back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When the two boys turn the corner and are out of Lynn's sight, Tommy rips his arm away.
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>

	Hey freak, how'd you like the "arm around your shoulder" bit. I just made it up. Went with it. That's what great actors do. It's called improv.

The den doubles as a playroom. Boxes of old toys sit in the corner. A small, plastic, multi-colored table sits on the rug.

Cole appears in the doorway. Malcolm sits up and smiles.

He points to the chair on the other side of the coffee table.

Cole looks a little more interested.

<MALCOLM>

	It's a mind-reading game... Did I mention I could read minds?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Cole nods, "No."
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's the game. I'll read your mind. If what I say is right, you take a step forwards the chair. If I'm wrong, you take a step backwards the doorway. If you reach the chair, you sit. If you reach the door, you can go. Deal?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Cole tilts his head, then nods, "Yes."

Malcolm presses his fingers to his temples like a vaudeville magician. He closes his eyes tight.

	You have a secret. But you don't want to tell me.

	You don't have to tell me your secret if you don't want to.

Malcolm smiles. Returns his fingers to the mind-reading position. Malcolm looks to Cole's arm. Cole is wearing A LARGE SILVER WATCH. It swims on his thin wrist. It could probably slide up to his shoulder. Malcolm closes his eyes.

	Your father gave you that watch as a present before he left.

INT. RESTAURANT - EVENING

Malcolm hurriedly enters a spacious, dimly-lit Italian restaurant. He stops in the dining room and searches the many candle-lit tables. He finds Anna.

Anna sits alone at a corner table. The remains of her half-eaten dinner lay on the only place setting on the table. A small PIECE OF CAKE WITH A CANDLE in it sits untouched.

Anna stirs sugar in her coffee as Malcolm sits in the seat across from her. She gently stops stirring, but doesn't look up. Beat.

</MALCOLM>

Anna looks around for the waiter.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It might be some kind of abuse.

That makes Anna turn back. She glances across the table, then looks down.

	There are cuts on Cole's arms. Fingernail marks, I think. Looks like defensive cuts.

	Hard to say this early. Could just be a child climbing a lot of trees.

Malcolm loses himself in his thoughts. The waiter drops off the check on the table. Anna grabs it before Malcolm and quickly signs it.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know I've been kind of out of it for a long while and you resent it. You do. I know you're mad. I know it's put some distance between us.

Beat.

Malcolm stops walking. The words hit him hard. He stares at Cole.

Malcolm's face is filled with emotion. Cole is suddenly hit by Malcolm's passion. Beat. Cole nods slowly as he looks at Malcolm with different eyes.

They start walking again in silence. They turn a corner and move down another street. Cole spots an old man with a cane standing at the gate of a brownstone.
</DIRECTION>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it okay if I do something? I have to do something.

INT. MR. MARSCHAL'S LIVING ROOM - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This brownstone has been home to the Marschal's for many, many years. It's filled with a lifetime of memories. Memories shared by two people.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two rocking chairs sit side by side near the windows that overlook the street... A corner table displays fancy wooden chess set. The game half-finished, frozen in a layer of dust... An easel stands before a piano. The incomplete water color painting of a smiling elderly woman sitting on the piano bench sits sadly on the faded yellow paper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm takes in the living room silently. He stands near the open door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cole walks through the room. Tiny eyes searching carefully. He leans behind the sofa looking for something. Malcolm watches Cole with a crinkled brow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cole peeks behind the old piano crammed against the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_MARSCHAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe Jill will play for us when she gets back.

</MR_MARSCHAL>

Cole turns to find Mr. Marschal standing with a glass of lemonade. Cole takes it from his shaking hands.
</DIRECTION>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Marschal shuffles over to the sofa. Takes a seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cole begins surveying the room again. Beat. His eyes finally come to rest on a plant seated in the corner. He stares at it... THE LEAVES OF THE PLANT SHAKE SLIGHTLY FROM A BREEZE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cole puts down his glass on a table and walks over to the plant. Cole kneels down and starts to push the potted plant aside. THE POT SCREECHES ON THE WOODEN FLOOR.

<DIRECTION>
Malcolm calls to Cole under his breath.

<MALCOLM>

	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_MARSCHAL>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Marschal strains to see across the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cole doesn't answer either of them. Instead, he continues to push the plant aside revealing AN AIR VENT. Cole gently reaches over and takes off the metal face. It slips right off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cole's hands disappear into the darkness of the vent. They reemerge holding a STACK OF NOTEBOOKS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm becomes very still.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cole rises to his feet and carries the notebooks over to Mr. Marschal. Cole carefully places them on his lap.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_MARSCHAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this for me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_MARSCHAL>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Marschal fingers the notebooks then reaches for his thick glasses hanging from his neck. He places them on the tip of his nose and inspects the notebooks six inches from his face.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	MR. MASCHAL What's this? Jill's keeping a diary.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm takes an involuntary step forward.

Mr. Marschal starts flipping through the notebooks.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_MARSCHAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's full of surprises...

He gets to the last book. His hands become still as he stares at the final page of writing.

<MR_MARSCHAL>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She hasn't written anything for some time.

Beat. Mr. Marschal slowly looks up from the notebooks. Looks up to Cole. Cole just stands quietly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Marschal's eyes slowly fill with tears of realization. They gently spill down his weathered face.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_MARSCHAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh no...

</MR_MARSCHAL>
<DIRECTION>
Cole takes a deep breath. Trying hard not to cry himself. The sight of Mr. Marschal weeping shakes Cole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cole softly lays his hand on Mr. Marschal's silver hair. Mr. Marschal reaches up and clutches his small hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They stay like that for a while. Beat. Mr. Marschal lets go and brings the notebooks tighter to his body.

Cole quietly walks to Malcolm who stands motionless. He stares down at Cole in a daze.

	April or March of Eighty-seven. Two weeks into sessions with Vincent Gray. I was treating a couple, Donald and Robin Wagner, who had lost their child to Leukemia. They were waiting with Vincent in the reception room of the downtown clinic. They were alone together maybe fifteen minutes. When I entered the room, all three were crying. The Wagner's progress from that afternoon was dramatic and sudden .... As if some door had been opened for them.

Lynn holds a laundry basket on her hip as she fiddles with the thermostat in the hall. The house is cold. Lynn wears a winter jacket in the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lynn turns and moves into the shadowy hallway. No lights. The house seems somewhat ominous. Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lynn's eyes dart to an open guest room like she just saw something. She stares in the doorway until a SOUND TURNS HER IN THE DIRECTION OF THE FAMILY ROOM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She picks up balled-up boy's sweat socks and dirty T-shirts laying on the carpet. When she reaches the end of the hall, she HITS A LIGHT SWITCH. The hall LIGHTS UP REVEALING A WALL OF PHOTOS. Lynn forms a tiny smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Snapshots of Cole and Lynn's life hang before her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cole's birthday parties... Lynn and Cole at an amusement park... Cole under the Christmas tree... Cole on Lynn's shoulders in a pool... Cole with a group of neighbors at a barbecue...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lynn takes a step forward. Lynn's face betrays the fact that she notices something she never noticed before. She touches a photo of three-year-old Cole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE MOVE INTO THE PHOTO -- COLE'S FACE SMILES AT US. LYNN'S FINGER GENTLY BRUSHES A THIN STREAKS OF LIGHT THAT CURVES IN THE BACKGROUND BEHIND COLE. THE STREAK OF LIGHT IS BLURRED, LIKE SOMETHING CAUGHT IN MOTION.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lynn looks to the adjacent photo -- the barbecue photo -- Everyone stands with hot dogs and sodas. Lynn searches the picture. Her eyes suddenly stop at the TINIEST BLUR OF WHITE LIGHT STREAKING AROUND COLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE MOVE FROM FRAMED PHOTO TO FRAMED PHOTO -- EACH THE SAME -- SOMEWHERE HIDDEN IN THE FRAME, SOMEWHERE NOT EASILY SEEN, LYNN FINDS A BLUR.

Lynn takes it all in curiously.

INT. COLE'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

Lynn moves into Cole's room with the laundry basket balanced on her hip. The Walkman headphones on her head blares A MUFFLED TECHNO DANCE BEAT. Lynn starts picking clothes up around Cole's room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This bedroom is an eerie place. The shadows seem to make shapes and figures. All the furniture is wood -- old fashioned. The lamps, the paintings on the wall -- antiques as well.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The most striking feature of the room, however, is the homemade tent created from bedsheets and blankets tied to chairs and bureaus. It takes up a large corner of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sign hangs over the bedsheets.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"DO NOT ENTER"
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Lynn grabs the spiderman P.J.s that drape over the tent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A German Shepherd Puppy sleeps on the pillow. SEBASTIAN lifts his head sleepily and peers at Lynn before returning to his slumber.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lynn slowly reaches for a picture frame that peeks out from under Cole's pillow. Slides it out... It's a VACATION PHOTO of a couple. Lynn and Cole and a man. The man looks in every way a larger version of Cole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The picture has a visible effect on Lynn. She lets out a shaky breath before returning the photo to its hiding place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lynn pulls a pair of school uniform pants off the wooden roll cover desk next to the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The desk is covered with loose leaf papers filled with writings. Lynn's eyes are drawn to the papers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her curious gaze turns serious. Her mouth opens a tiny bit involuntarily.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE PAPERS are strewn with lines of handwriting. Countless lines. Thousands of words... Some horizontal, some vertical... The writing moves in arcs and flows in various size -- written at great speed -- every word connected by a single pen stroke -- everything written in one continuous motion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lynn slowly spins the papers, taking in some of the phrases...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...Christ break the freaking glass oh no God no what the hell is going on Quiet the damn baby I'll cut you I swear it someone stop the burning I'll kill you I'll kill all you bastard...

The words go on and on.

Stanley Cunningham looks over the class of blank faces. He's just about to answer his own question when he sees a hand go up. Mr. Cunningham looks surprised to see who it is.

MR. CUNNINGHAM SLAMS HIS HAND ON COLE'S DESK. Cole's hands drop from his eyes. The teacher's face is burning red.

The children in the room are frozen. Completely startled.

Cole is seated in the school library by himself. He sits at a long center table near the windows. His head is laying on his folded arms on the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm peeks his head in the door -- unsure if he's in the right place. He spots Cole and enters the room. He silently takes a seat across from Cole. The eight-year-old looks up. Cole's eyes are hard -- filled with anger.

Cole stares for a second.

Cole lowers his head. Malcolm just sits and thinks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SOUND OF BOYS PLAYING SPORTS ON THE FIELD OUTSIDE FILTER IN THROUGH THE LIBRARY WINDOWS.

Cole turns his head and stares at the windows. Malcolm takes in the sad vision of this boy. It affects him. Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you like magic?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Cole's face softens a bit. He turns from the windows and looks to Malcolm. Beat. Cole nods, "Yes."

<DIRECTION>
Malcolm pulls out a penny from his pocket. He places it in his right hand.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Malcolm closes his hand around the penny.

Malcolm shakes his hand in circles. Cole watches his hand carefully.

<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And suddenly the penny has magically traveled to my left hand...

</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Cole looks to Malcolm's closed left hand. Malcolm doesn't open it.

<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But that's not the end of the trick. With another magic shake, the penny travels into my shirt pocket...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Cole's eyes lock on Malcolm's shirt. Malcolm taps the pocket but doesn't open it.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But that's still not the end!... I do a final magic shake... and suddenly... The penny returns to the hand where it started from.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm opens his right hand. The penny sits quietly in the center of his palm.

Cole looks at the penny and then up to Malcolm's face. Beat. Cole cracks a smile.

Malcolm smiles a mischievous smile. He places the penny on the table. Cole stares at it and then looks to Malcolm.

</WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm turns AT THE SOUND OF THE WOMAN, and moves into the empty living room where the T.V. is on. A blanket lays crumpled on the sofa.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE WOMAN'S VOICE IS COMING FROM A VIDEO PLAYING ON THE VCR. IT'S A WEDDING VIDEO. A LARGE WOMAN IN A BRIDESMAID DRESS STANDS HOLDING THE MICROPHONE. IN THE BACKGROUND, WE CAN SEE THE DANCE FLOOR.

	<DIALOGUE>
	No doubt about it. Anna's like my sister. You better make her happy... And I'm not talking about -- mmm this tastes like real butter -- kind of happy... I'm talking about Julie Andrews twirling around like a mental patient on a mountain top -- kind of happy.

THE WOMAN HANDS THE MICROPHONE TO SOMEONE OFF SCREEN. THE CAMERA PANS AWAY FROM HER AND ZOOMS IN ON THE DANCE FLOOR. MALCOLM AND ANNA ARE SLOW DANCING. THEY'RE WHISPERING AND LAUGHING WITH EACH OTHER. THE HAPPINESS FROM THEM IS TANGIBLE.

Malcolm can't help smiling as he stares at the flickering images. He turns and looks down the hall to their bedroom.

Malcolm steps into the bathroom quietly. He stares at the silhouette of Anna's body through the smoked glass of the shower. Anna stands still, her head tilted back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm watches quietly. By his experience, it's clear he's taken by his wife's beauty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm starts towards the shower when his eyes glance to the sink. Malcolm locks on a tiny bottle resting on the marble surface.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches out and picks it up. The label on the plastic bottle reads,
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Zoloft Anti-depressant" "To be taken twice daily"

Malcolm gently puts down the plastic bottle. He gazes at the still figure of his wife as the water covers her.

Malcolm leaves the bathroom. He makes sure not to make a noise with the door as he closes it shut.

Cole and an overweight boy named BOBBY are seated at a dining table covered in colorful paper. A stack of birthday presents are sitting on the table next to a cake.

The house is filled with the SOUND OF CHILDREN PLAYING AND LAUGHING.

Cole and the overweight boy are the only ones in the dining room. Bobby watches with a dull expression as Cole moves his hand in circles in the air.

Cole turns a corner and comes to a dead stop. He turns white as he stares at an open CRAWL SPACE CLOSET a few feet away. Cole's eyes are riveted in the darkness of the closet. Beat.

<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't!

Tommy slams the door closed. Darren turns the lock. They crack smiles at each other as Cole bangs on the door.

The BANGING GOES ON FOR A FEW SECONDS AND THEN IT JUST STOPS.

Darren and Tommy look at each other and then back at the crawl space door.

Then THE SCREAMING BEGINS.

Darren and Tommy back away from the door as COLE SCREAMS IN TERROR at the top of his lungs. He CRASHES OVER AND OVER against the door. HIS BODY SLAMMING AGAINST THE WOOD. The DOOR RATTLES like it's going to break off its hinges.

The two boys are statues as Cole's BLOOD-CHILLING YELLS FILL THE HALLWAY.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

Cole lays rigid in the hospital bed. Blankets bundled around him as if to shield him. Cole's eyes fixed out the window.

Malcolm quietly enters through the half-opened door to the room. Cole spots him. Visibly relaxes.

<MALCOLM>

Cole smiles weakly as Malcolm takes a seat on a rolling metal chair.

MALCOLM'S EYES -- slowly turn and survey the room. They find nothing. Malcolm returns to watching Cole.

COLE'S EYES LOOK AROUND THE ROOM WARILY... WE MOVE IN ON THEM -- TILL HIS EYES FILL THE FRAME.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then we see what he's staring at. Through Cole's hospital room window we see the adjacent wing of the hospital building. Rows of hospital room windows are visible. In the windows are patients... SOME OLD, SOME YOUNG... SOME ARE DRESSED IN MODERN HOSPITAL GOWNS... SOME FROM DECADES PAST.

The STREETS TURN RED as Lynn drives home from the hospital in silence. She glances down to her right.

Cole is curled up asleep on the passenger seat, back in his regular clothes, a tiny party hat clutched in his hand. He looks like a four-year-old.

Lynn lays Cole gently on his bed next to his German Shepherd Puppy. Cole curls up with Sebastian.

<DIRECTION>
Lynn watches the two youngsters sleep for a moment. Cole is curled up asleep with a tiny party hat clutched in his hands. He looks like a four-year-old. Lynn has been carrying Cole's sweater from over her shoulder. She pulls it off and begins to fold it. Her attention is drawn to the sweater. She fingers the fabric of the back. IT'S RIPPED. Her eyes move to Cole. In the middle of the back of his T-shirt are THREE SMALL TEARS. Lynn pushes the fabric open with her fingers and sees DEEP FINGERNAIL LIKE SCRATCHES on his skin.

A LIGHT TURNS ON FROM UNDER COLE'S DOOR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens a crack. Cole's tiny face peeks out. Eyes scan the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens a little bit more. Cole's knees are pressed together. His body dances a little. Cole has to pee. He moves cautiously into the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cole moves briskly to a door halfway down the corridor. Opens it. Cole turns on the LIGHT IN THE BATHROOM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He checks behind the shower curtain, before he turns his back and pees into the toilet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LARGE FIGURE MOVES PAST THE DOORWAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cole instantly stops peeing. His body becomes very still. He slowly reaches for the toilet handle and flushes. He closes his pants and turns. He doesn't come out of the bathroom at first. He just stands there and stares into the darkness of the hall. HIS BREATH FORMS TINY CLOUDS IN THE COLD AIR.

Beat. Cole finally steps out into the hallway. His eyes catch a SLANT OF LIGHT now coming from the kitchen.

The red interior of the tent gets LIP UP.

It's a striking sight. The bedsheet walls of the tent are lined with religious pictures taped to the walls. Tiny statues of saints surround the interior perimeter. We see the statue Cole stole from the church is in here... This tent is a sanctuary made by an eight-year-old to hide in.

WE HEAR MOVEMENT. Anna emerges from the bedroom. Eyes raw. She wipes her tears.

She picks up the phone and moves down the stairs.

Malcolm walks out into the hall. Stops at the top of the stairs.

ANNA'S VOICE CAN BE HEARD SPEAKING ON THE PHONE from downstairs.

	I can't talk now.

Malcolm doesn't hear anything as Anna listens to the person on the phone. She smiles as she wipes her tears. He starts for the basement door again.

<DIRECTION>
He moves to the dinner table where Lynn is seated. Cole sits. His hands go on the table. He's wearing a pair of his father's extra large LEATHER GLOVES. Cole's small hands don't even fill the palm area. Cole has difficulty trying to pick up his milk glass with the gloves.

Cole slowly turns back and looks down the hall.

SUDDENLY IN THE STILLNESS AND THE DARKNESS, A SMALL FIGURE SCURRIES FROM ANOTHER BEDROOM INTO THE BLACKNESS OF COLE'S ROOM. IT HAPPENS LIKE A FLASH.

Cole stops breathing.

THE FIGURE SLOWLY STEPS OUT FROM COLE'S DOORWAY.

IT'S A BOY. A FEW YEARS OLDER THAN COLE.

An antique engagement ring sits on a velvet stand.

Anna laughs. Sean holds up a weathered hardback copy of "THE GREAT GATSBY." Beat.

Sean puts down the book and hugs her. He pulls back a little, still holding her. They smile at each other.

Beat. The moment goes on just that crucial fraction of a second too long. Their smiles slowly melt away as they continue to hold each other. Nothing happens for the longest time.

CRASH! A SHATTERING DOOR SLAM ECHOES THROUGH THE STORE. Anna and Jeffery pull apart. They rush past the young man and the young woman to the front of the store. They find the glass front door cracked in a spider web pattern.

They carefully push open the door and step out onto the sidewalk. Look around. No one in sight.

Lynn leans over, looks at the side of her son's pensive face.

They slow and come to a rest at the bumper of their car. Lynn leans over -- sees the side of Cole's face smiling.

His smile fades away as he notices his mother fiddling with the HEATER controls.

Cole gazes out the front windshield as the car moves towards home.

Suddenly a piece of paper sticks to the windshield. It's a page from a Playbill. A 1941 Playbill. It flies away revealing a woman in a flowing flowery dress from the 40's suddenly walks into the middle of the street as the pages of her Playbill swirl in the air.

Playbills stick to the windshield obstructing the view.

Lynn slams the brakes... Too late.

COLE SCREAMS. LYNN SCREAMS... THE CAR SCREECHES TO A STOP IN THE MIDDLE OF A CONGESTED INTERSECTION.

The line of cars behind them suddenly hit their brakes and swerve to one side avoiding a mass collision. After a few seconds, the entire intersection has come to a halt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cole who has shut his eyes... slowly opens them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks around fearfully. His eyes move to the windshield. No broken glass. No blood. And no woman. Cole looks out through the pristine windshield onto the street where cars are stopped and staring all around them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cole slowly looks over to his mother. He finds her staring at him in complete and utter disbelief. Her hands clutch the wheel. The whites of her knuckles showing her fear. She has no idea why he screamed.

Cole searches for the answer in Malcolm's eyes... He finds it. It's not the one he wanted. Malcolm looks down.

Cole reaches into his pocket. Pulls out a PENNY.

INT. BASEMENT - AFTERNOON

<DIRECTION>
Malcolm sits stoically at his desk in his basement. His eyes gaze at the dusty FRAMED CERTIFICATE FROM THE CITY OF PHILADELPHIA shoved between two packing boxes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm leans his head back against the chair. Stares into the shadows. Drowns in his thoughts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. THE CHAIR CREAKS as he slowly sits up again. Malcolm's eyes scan the room and come to a stop on a box marked with the label...

A SLIGHT STATIC STARTS TO FILTER IN ON THE TAPE.

Malcolm's eyes are locked on the spool of audio tape as it spins in the player.

Malcolm's fingers move to the volume dial. He turns it way up. THE STATIC NOISE FROM THE TAPE FILLS THE BASEMENT.

Malcolm leans closer to the tape player. Closes his eyes and listens... Beat.

Malcolm stands on a familiar sidewalk. He stares into the bay window of Mr. Marschal's brownstone.

Inside the window we see Mr. Marschal seated with a group of older gentlemen his age. They sit around a table eating sandwiches and talking. Malcolm watches as Mr. Marschal tells a story to his friends. WE CAN'T HEAR WHAT HE'S SAYING, but when he finishes everyone at the table laughs. Mr. Marschal smiles.

Malcolm can't help smiling as well. This is not the same man he saw before. Life has returned to this house. Beat.

Malcolm moves to the front of the church down the center aisle. His eyes scan the empty seats. No one in sight in any direction.

Malcolm stands in the aisle a little out of breath. He holds his hand to his side as he winces a bit.

Malcolm's eyes float up to the balcony where toy soldiers sit on the bannister. Cole's head pops up.

Further down the sidewalk, coming out of the front door of his house is SEAN.

Malcolm's face turns to stone. He watches as Sean comes down the front stairs and starts across the street.

A sudden rage surges up. Malcolm moves towards Sean fast.

Sean reaches his car and enters it. He doesn't notice the figure closing in on him.

Cole stands in the doorway to his mother's bedroom. He looks over the room carefully. Everything is still.

Lynn's room is sparse. No paintings, no accessaries. A bed without a frame sits in the corner. A table with a sewing machine fills the other side of the room.

HIS BREATH ROLLS IN A TINY CLOUD IN FRONT OF HIM.

Cole's brow furrows. He breathes again. This time intentionally. Watches as his breath materializes in the suddenly ice cold air.

COLE'S P.O.V. -- A dark, abandoned building stretches for an entire block on one side. A MAN IN A GREY, FULL-BODIED UNIFORM WITH NUMBERS PRINTED ACROSS HIS CHEST...

Cole and Malcolm join the visitors as they walk slowly towards the doors.

A FAMILY PORTRAIT HANGS NEAR THE FRONT DOOR. Two girls, one bigger, one smaller sit on the ground in front of their mother and father. Their smiling faces welcome the mourners.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm and Cole are standing at the bottom of a staircase. Waiting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The front door opens as another group arrives. Malcolm nods to Cole as the foyer fills up. The two of them quietly disappear upstairs.

INT. HALLWAY - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The narrow hall is lined with boxes of medical supplies. I.V. stands, sterile needles and pads are in the process of being taken away. The boxes are piled outside a closed bedroom door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cole stares at the shut door like he doesn't want to go in. His eyes move to the large, colorful map of the world that dons the hallway wall. He gazes at the many countries and continents. Beat.

INT. GIRL'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cole closes the door behind him. He turns and gazes at the girl's bedroom. There's a hospital bed near the window. The walls are covered with get-well cards and drawings from family, friends, and school children.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her shelves are filled with puppets. All shapes and sizes of puppets. Next to the shelf is a puppet stage and a camcorder on a mini tripod sitting next to it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cole walks to the shelf and picks up a FINGER PUPPET DANCER. He places it in his pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the girl's desk, is a large collection of video cassettes. The labels read, "Puppet Show Christmas 96," "Puppet Show Birthday party," "Puppet Show class trip"...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cole reads the labels carefully before moving towards the closets. He passes the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AN EMACIATED HAND REACHES OUT FROM BENEATH THE BED AND GRABS COLE'S ANKLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cole jerks back startled. He watches as the girl's hand slips back under the bed. Cole stays very still. Waits. Nothing happens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He slowly bends down. His hands touch the floor. He tilts his head and looks under the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The emaciated little girl who came to his tent lays curled on the floor. Her bulging eyes glare at Cole. She moves suddenly. Thrusts a jewelry box forward. It slides across the wooden floor and stops just before Cole. Cole and the sickly girl stare at each other. Neither of them say a word.

INT. LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is thick with mourners. Most are gathered around the GIRL'S MOTHER, a young woman in her late twenties. As she moves through the room to the kitchen, she receives the many cards, hugs, and flowers that are offered as condolence. Mrs. Collins leaves the living room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm watches breathlessly from the doorway as Cole moves through the many adults across the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The girl's father, MR. COLLINS, a thin man in his late twenties, is seated on the reading chair next to a T.V. His face is granite. No one in the room dares to talk to him. He stares statue-like at an abstract point in the room.
</DIRECTION>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mister?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<DIRECTION>
The man doesn't react. Some of the guests look oddly at the little boy standing before the man.
</DIRECTION>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me, Mister.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. The man slowly turns and looks down at the boy standing next to him. Cole is very shaky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm watches everything anxiously.

<DIRECTION>
Cole stares at Mr. Collins.
</DIRECTION>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you Kyra's daddy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<DIRECTION>
The man's face begins to crumble. Beat. He nods, "yes" softly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cole holds out the jewelry box. It trembles with his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The father just stares at it. Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's for you...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She wanted to tell you something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<DIRECTION>
The father becomes very still. His eyes fill with a storm of confusion and pain. After the longest time, the father reaches and gently takes the box out of Cole's small hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cole begins to back away...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The father gazes at Cole as he melts into the crowd. Cole reaches Malcolm and the two then slip out of the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The father looks down in a daze. He goes to open the jewelry box. His movements are slow and strained. He lifts the latch and open the box.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Collins stares at an unlabeled video cassette.

INT. LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
People in the room start to turn as the T.V. comes on. Mr. Collins is seated now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE STATIC SNOW ON THE SCREEN IS QUICKLY REPLACED BY AN IMAGE. TWO PUPPETS DANCE ON STAGE. WE HEAR KYRA'S VOICE SING FOR THE PUPPETS AS THEY DANCE AROUND.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her father's face forms the most heartbreaking of smiles as he watches the performance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The entire room has stopped what they were doing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
T.V. SCREEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE HEAR FOOTSTEPS COMING UP THE STAIRS. The puppets go limp. The entire stage gets lifted up. We see it carried away by Kyra. We can view the whole bedroom now. The camera is seated on her desk in the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kyra climbs in bed and pretends to be sleeping when the door opens. It's Mrs. Collins. She carries in a tray of soup and a sandwich.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LIVING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd watches in riveted silence. The father never takes his eyes off of the screen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The image of the mother prepares the meal. She uncovers the fruit and the soup. Places a straw into the drink.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then it happens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The image of the mother walks to a closet. Opens it. An assortment of household cleaners and sponges are kept inside. She pulls out a bottle of floor cleaner. Reads the label for the ingredients. Walks back to the food tray, where she unscrews the cap on the floor cleaner. The mother pours some into the cap. Checks it.

	<DIALOGUE>

The mother pours some into the bottle. The remainder goes into the child's soup. She replaces the cap and puts the bottle back in the closet.

The image of the mother turns to the bed carrying the tray. She places the food on a metallic rolling table and swings it over the bed.

Kyra picks up the spoon and takes a sip. Her face crinkles at the taste. She looks up at her mother.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_COLLINS>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't say it tastes funny. You know I don't like to hear that.

Kyra slowly brings the spoon to her mouth and swallows another spoonful.

INT. DINING ROOM - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Collins is seated at the dining room surrounded by friends and family. She fixes one of the many bouquets of flowers on the table. It takes her a beat before she feels the stare.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standing in the doorway to the dining room is Mr. Collins. A group of ashen faced guests stand in the distance behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Husband and wife's eyes meet. Mrs. Collins smiles softly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Collins' eyes tremble with tears.

	You were keeping her sick...

The whole world stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The mother's face registers confusion at first. Then slow realization. Her eyes glace at the many faces around her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks back at her husband. His glare is painful. Rage filling every cell of his body. Tears falling faster down his cheeks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Collins turns her attention back to the flowers. She concentrates with all her strength. Beat. Her hands begin to shake.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_COLLINS>
<DIRECTION>
(to no one)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I took care of her...

EXT. HOUSE - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cole sits on the swings next to Kyra's four-year-old sister. She doesn't look up.

Malcolm waits in the driveway. Watches them from a distance.
</DIRECTION>

Cole reaches into his pocket and pulls out the little FINGER PUPPET. He holds it out.
</DIRECTION>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You liked it, she said.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<DIRECTION>
The four-year-old stares at the finger puppet, then quietly takes it in her small hands.

<DIRECTION>
The two children don't say anything for a while. Malcolm glances to the house, where all movements in and out of the home has ceased.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cole turns to the four-year-old.
</DIRECTION>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She watched out for you.

The little girl stares down at the finger puppet. Cole lightly places a hand on her shoulder.

Nothing else is said. Nothing else is done.

INT. PROP ROOM - AFTERNOON

Stanley Cunningham moves between two curtains and comes to a prop room door in the back. He puts an ear to the door, listens and then knocks. After a second, he enters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Cunningham finds Cole sitting in a poor villager costume as a FEMALE TEACHER kneels next to him and makes final adjustments. Cole and the woman glance at Mr. Cunningham.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_CUNNINGHAM>

	They're calling for the stable boy.

The Female Teacher looks to Cole and nods.

INT. AUDITORIUM - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm moves quickly to a set of double doors and opens them. He steps into the DARKNESS OF THE AUDITORIUM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The play is in full swing... Cole and a large group of costumed children are on stage. Cole holds a broom and wears a worn-down costume. He stands to the side -- hidden by others.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A boy in a shiny-armored costume walks to the center of the stage where a large cardboard stone is seated. A sparkling HANDLE sticks out of the top.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The armored boy tries to lift it. It won't budge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby, the chubby boy from the party, is dressed in a magician's costume. He is Merlin. He steps forward.
</DIRECTION>
<MERLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only he who is pure of heart can take the sword from the stone.

Merlin looks to the group on stage. Looks right at Cole.

The group of villagers on the stage LAUGH AND MOCK THE SUGGESTION.

Tommy Tammisimo is dressed in a mismatched costume -- he hops around, clearly embarrassed.

	Silence village idiot! Let the boy step forward.

Tommy turns a deep shade of red and hobbles off the stage.

Merlin looks to Cole. He smiles a true friend's smile.
</DIRECTION>
<MERLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Arthur...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERLIN>
<DIRECTION>
Cole hesitates. Not because he's acting. He really hesitates. It takes him a moment before he steps forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cole steps up to the stone. He places his hand around the handle. Begins to pull. The sword starts to come out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The villagers GASP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cole raises the shiny sword out of the stone and high above his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Merlin and everyone on stage bows. A SILENCE FILLS THE AUDITORIUM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm watches his client, standing unafraid in the spot light for the first time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The villagers rise and rush to Cole. They scoop him up and carry him around the stage in celebration. Cole chuckles and then starts laughing as the group of eight-year-olds try unsuccessfully to keep him up. They slowly sag and then collapse. All the students are laughing as they try to untangle themselves.

Malcolm watches with utter joy as Cole becomes indistinguishable among of a group of twenty children giggling and enjoying themselves on stage.

	</DIALOGUE>
</LYNN>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They want me to do things for them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<LYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They talk to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYNN>
<DIRECTION>
Cole nods, "Yes."
</DIRECTION>
<LYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They tell you to do things?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYNN>
<DIRECTION>
Cole nods "Yes" again. Lynn becomes upset. She nods with grave understanding. Cole watches her.
</DIRECTION>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you thinking, Momma?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<LYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYNN>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think I'm a freak?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<DIRECTION>
Lynn's eyes moves to Cole.
</DIRECTION>
<LYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at my face.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYNN>
<DIRECTION>
Cole gazes at her intense expression.
</DIRECTION>
<LYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would never think that about you ... ever... Got it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYNN>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Got it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<DIRECTION>
BEAT. Cole smiles a tiny smile. Lynn glances down.
</DIRECTION>
<LYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just let me think for a second.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYNN>
<DIRECTION>
She drowns in her thoughts. Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grandma says hi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<DIRECTION>
Lynn looks up sharply.
</DIRECTION>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She says she's sorry for taking the bumble bee pendant. She just likes it a lot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<LYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYNN>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grandma comes to visit me sometimes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<DIRECTION>
Lynn becomes still. Her face is unreadable. When she speaks, her words are extremely controlled.
</DIRECTION>
<LYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cole, that's very wrong. Grandma's gone. You know that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYNN>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<DIRECTION>
Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She wanted me to tell you--
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<LYNN>
<DIRECTION>
(soft)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cole, please stop.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYNN>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She wanted me to tell you, she saw you dance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<DIRECTION>
Lynn's eyes lock on Cole's.
</DIRECTION>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She said when you were little, you and her had a fight right before your dance recital. You thought she didn't come to see you dance. She did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<DIRECTION>
Lynn brings her hands to her mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She hid in the back so you wouldn't see... She said you were like an angel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<DIRECTION>
Lynn begins to cry.
</DIRECTION>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She said, you came to her where they buried her. Asked her a question... She said the answer is "Everyday."
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<DIRECTION>
Lynn covers her face with her hands. The tears roll out through her fingers.
</DIRECTION>
<COLE>
<DIRECTION>
(whispers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did you ask?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. Lynn looks at her son. She barely gets the words out.
</DIRECTION>
<LYNN>
<DIRECTION>
(crying)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do I make her proud?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYNN>
<DIRECTION>
Cole moves closer to Lynn. She cradles him in her arms. Mother and son hold each other tight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE PULL BACK FROM THE WINDSHIELD, BACK PAST THE FRONT BUMPER WHERE THE FIGURE OF THE BLOODED WOMAN STANDS STARING AT COLE AND HIS MOTHER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE SEE A MANGLED BIKE PULLED OUT FROM THE REAR-ENDED CAR ON THE SIDEWALK. WE MOVE UP AND AWAY FROM THE RAIN-SOAKED BRIDGE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MALCOLM'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm walks quietly down the sidewalk towards his home.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm enters the living room and smiles at what he sees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna is asleep in a chair. She's curled up in a ball. In a way, she looks like a little girl.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Their WEDDING VIDEO PLAYS SOFTLY ON THE TELEVISION.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm watches himself and Anna cutting their wedding cake. THE CROWD APPLAUDS AS THEY FEED EACH OTHER PIECES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm turns from the television and takes a seat next to Anna. He gazes upon his wife softly.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
(whispers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anna, I've been so lost.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need my best friend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. Malcolm gazes for a beat before looking down.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I miss you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm's eyes move back up. He looks at his sleeping wife. ANNA'S TALKING IN HER SLEEP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm can't believe it.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I miss you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. Her lips move again. Eyes never open.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, Malcolm?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What, Anna? What did I do? What's made you so sad?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why did you leave me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't leave you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. She becomes silent. Anna falls back into deep sleep, her arm slides down. SOMETHING SHINY FALLS OUT AND ROLLS ON THE GROUND.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm's eyes watch as it comes to a stop... Beat. He gazes curiously at a GOLD WEDDING BAND laying on the wood floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Confusion washes over his face. He looks to Anna's hand... An identical gold wedding ring sits on her finger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. Malcolm looks down at his own hand... HIS WEDDING RING IS GONE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm is completely lost. He takes a couple steps back. Looks around in confusion...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes come to rest on the door to his basement office. He looks in disbelief at the set of DEAD BOLT LOCKS on the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm doesn't know what the hell's going on... His eyes are drawn to the dining table... Only ONE PLACE SETTING is out on the tabletop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes search again -- they finally lock on the WEDDING VIDEO PLAYING. Malcolm watches images of himself on the screen... His eyes fill with a storm of emotions...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm looks to Anna's face and becomes very still. Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON ANNA... TILL HER SLEEPING FACE FILLS THE FRAME... IT'S NOW WE NOTICE FOR THE FIRST TIME, THAT ANNA'S BREATHS ARE FORMING TINY CLOUDS IN THE COLD AIR.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
(like he's falling down a deep hole)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
SLAM CUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASHBACK: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIOLENT GUN SHOTS RING THROUGH THE BEDROOM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna rushes across the room to a crumpled Malcolm laying on the floor. Malcolm's hands are clutched at his side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna pries his hands away to reveal the tiniest tear in his shirt. Anna's eyes catch something dark -- moving... A POOL OF BLOOD IS FORMING UNDER MALCOLM. She slowly turns him over on his side... A horrific sight... An enormous exit wound on his lower back pours out blood uncontrollably.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm's jaw is locked open. His breaths are long and strained.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANNA IS SCREAMING, BUT HER VOICE SOUNDS FAR AWAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm's open jaw releases a long strained breath and then becomes silent. Anna tries to cover the wound with her hands desperately.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SLAM CUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PRESENT: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
(screaming)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	ANNA!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
MALCOLM'S VOICE SHAKES THE ROOM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna just sleeps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm staggers back. His breathing erratic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a seat across from her. He looks at his wife and suddenly becomes very still.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna's still curled up asleep, but tears are falling from her shut eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't cry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Anna doesn't move, but her tears seem to fall a little faster.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I have to go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm's mind is racing.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
(realizing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just needed to do a couple of things.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I needed to tell you something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were never second... Ever.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm gazes at his wife. Tears fall from both their eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sleep now, Anna. Everything will be different in the morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Anna lays still.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goodnight, Malcolm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goodnight, sweetheart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
The room falls into silence. Malcolm sits still across from his wife. He drinks her in with his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm leans back in the chair. Slowly closes his eyes. They close shut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE ARE TIGHT ON ANNA... WE SEE HER SOFT BREATHS FORMING A TINY CLOUD IN THE COLD AIR...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WITH EACH BREATH, THEY BECOME LESS AND LESS VISIBLE... THE ROOM BECOMING LESS AND LESS COLD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOON HER BREATHS AREN'T VISIBLE AT ALL. SHE BREATHES GENTLY, FALLING BACK INTO A PEACEFUL SLEEP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE PULL BACK to reveal Anna alone in the living room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE WEDDING VIDEO PLAYS ITS LAST SCENES... MALCOLM IS AT THE MICROPHONE ON THE DANCE FLOOR IN FRONT OF ALL THE GUESTS. HE'S HOLDING A GLASS OF WINE.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
(on tape)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I think I've had too much to drink.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm smiles as he takes a sip. The guests chuckle as they watch. Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
(on tape)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just have to say, this day today has been one very special day... I wish we all could stay and play.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd erupts in LAUGHTER.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
(on tape)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm looks around at everyone's smiling faces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. Malcolm takes his time. He looks just past the camera.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anna, I never thought I'd feel the things I'm feeling. I never thought I'd be able to stand up in front of my friends and family and tell them what's inside me... Today I can...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm's eyes fill with water.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
(softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anna Crowe... I am in love. In love I am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO BLACK:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
