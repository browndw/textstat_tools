A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...

<DIRECTION>
STAR WARS EPISODE VI: RETURN OF THE JEDI.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the main title. War drums echo through the heavens as a rollup slowly crawls into infinity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luke Skywalker has returned to his home planet of Tatooine in an attempt to rescue his friend Han Solo from the clutches of the vile gangster Jabba the Hutt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Little does Luke know that the GALACTIC EMPIRE has secretly begun construction on a new armored space station even more powerful than the first dreaded Death Star.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When completed, this ultimate weapon will spell certain doom for the small band of Rebels struggling to restore freedom to the galaxy...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAN DOWN to reveal a monstrous half-completed Death Star, its massive superstructure curling away from the completed section like the arms of a giant octopus. Beyond, in benevolent contrast, floats the small, green moon of ENDOR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An Imperial Star Destroyer moves overhead toward the massive armored space station, followed by two zipping TIE fighters. A small Imperial shuttle rockets from the main bay of the ship and hustles toward the Death Star.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - COCKPIT

INT. DEATH STAR - CONTROL ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Operators move about among the control panels. A SHIELD OPERATOR hits switches beside a large screen, on which is a display of the Death Star, the moon Endor, and a bright web delineating the invisible deflector shield.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A control officer rushes over to the shield operator.
</DIRECTION>
<OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Inform the commander that Lord Vader'sshuttle has arrived.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OFFICER>
<OPERATOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OPERATOR>
<DIRECTION>
The control officer moves to a view port and watches as the Imperial shuttle lands in the massive docking bay. A squad of Imperial stormtroopers moves into formation before the craft.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN DOCKING BAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The DEATH STAR COMMANDER, MOFF JERJERROD, a tall, confident technocrat, strides through the assembled troops to the base of the shuttle ramp. The troops snap to attention; many are uneasy about the new arrival. But the Death Star commander stands arrogantly tall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The exit hatch of the shuttle opens with a WHOOSH, revealing only darkness. Then, heavy FOOTSTEPS AND MECHANICAL BREATHING. From this black void appears DARTH VADER, LORD OF THE SITH. Vader looks over the assemblage as he walks down the ramp.
</DIRECTION>
<JERJERROD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure.We're honored by your presence.

</JERJERROD>
<VADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You may dispense with the pleasantries,Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule.

The commander turns ashen and begins to shake.

<JERJERROD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are workingas fast as they can.

<JERJERROD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But he asks the impossible. I need more men.

</JERJERROD>
<VADER>

	<DIALOGUE>
	That is correct, Commander. And he is mostdispleased with your apparent lack of progress.

</VADER>
<JERJERROD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We shall double our efforts.

EXT. ROAD TO JABBA'S PALACE - TATOOINE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A lonely, windswept road meanders through the desolate Tatooine terrain. We HEAR a familiar BEEPING and a distinctive reply before catching sight of ARTOO-DETOO and SEE-THREEPIO, making their way along the road toward the ominous palace of Jabba the Hutt.
</DIRECTION>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course I'm worried. And you should be, too. Lando Calrissian and poor Chewbacca never returned from this awful place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THREEPIO>
<DIRECTION>
Artoo whistles timidly.
</DIRECTION>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be so sure. If I told you half the things I've heard about this Jabba the Hutt, You'd probably short-circuit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THREEPIO>
<DIRECTION>
The two droids fearfully approach the massive gate to the palace.
</DIRECTION>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Artoo, are you sure this is the right place?I better knock, I suppose.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THREEPIO>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JABBA'S PALACE - GATE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Threepio looks around for some kind of signaling device, then timidly knocks on the iron door.
</DIRECTION>
<THREEPIO>
<DIRECTION>
(instantly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There doesn't seem to be anyone there. Let's go back and tell Master Luke.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THREEPIO>
<DIRECTION>
A small hatch in the middle of the door opens and a spidery mechanical arm, with a large electronic eyeball on the end, pops out and inspects the two droids.
</DIRECTION>
<STRANGE_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tee chuta hhat yudd!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRANGE_VOICE>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goodness gracious me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</THREEPIO>
<DIRECTION>
Threepio points to Artoo, then to himself.
</DIRECTION>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Artoo Detoowha bo Seethreepiowha ey toota oddmischka Jabba du Hutt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THREEPIO>
<DIRECTION>
The eye looks from one robot to the other, there is a laugh then the eye zips back into the door. The hatch slams shut. Artoo beeps his concern.
</DIRECTION>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think they're going to let us in,Artoo. We'd better go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THREEPIO>
<DIRECTION>
Artoo beeps his reluctance as Threepio turns to leave. Suddenly the massive door starts to rise with a horrific metallic SCREECH. The robots turn back and face an endless black cavity. The droids look at one another, afraid to enter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Artoo starts forward into the gloom. Threepio rushes after his stubby companion. The door lowers noisily behind them.
</DIRECTION>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Artoo, wait. Oh, dear! Artoo. Artoo, I reallydon't think we should rush into all this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THREEPIO>
<DIRECTION>
Artoo continues down the corridor, with Threepio following.
</DIRECTION>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Artoo! Artoo, wait for me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</THREEPIO>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JABBA'S PALACE - HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door slams shut with a loud crash that echoes throughout the dark passageway. The frightened robots are met by two giant, green GAMORREAN GUARDS, who fall in behind them. Threepio glances quickly back at the two lumbering brutes, then back to Artoo. One guard grunts an order. Artoo beeps nervously.
</DIRECTION>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just you deliver Master Luke's message andget us out of here. Oh my! Oh! Oh, no.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THREEPIO>
<DIRECTION>
Walking toward them out of the darkness is BIB FORTUNA, a humanlike alien with long tentacles protruding from his skull.
</DIRECTION>
<BIB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Die Wanna Wanga!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIB>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, my! Die Wanna Wauaga. We -- we bring amessage to your master, Jabba the Hutt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THREEPIO>
<DIRECTION>
Artoo lets out a series of quick beeps.
</DIRECTION>
<THREEPIO>
<DIRECTION>
(cont)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and a gift.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(thinks a moment, then to Artoo)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gift, what gift?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THREEPIO>
<DIRECTION>
Bib shakes his head negatively.
</DIRECTION>
<BIB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nee Jabba no badda. Me chaade su goodie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIB>
<DIRECTION>
Bib holds out his hand toward Artoo and the tiny droid backs up a bit, letting out a protesting array of squeaks. Threepio turns to the strange-looking alien.
</DIRECTION>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He says that our instructions are to give itonly to Jabba himself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THREEPIO>
<DIRECTION>
Bib thinks about this for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever sostubborn about these sort of things.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THREEPIO>
<DIRECTION>
Bib gestures for the droids to follow.
</DIRECTION>
<BIB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nudd Chaa.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIB>
<DIRECTION>
The droids follow the tall, tentacled alien into the darkness, trailed by the two guards.
</DIRECTION>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Artoo, I have a bad feeling about this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THREEPIO>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JABBA'S THRONE ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The throne room is filled with the vilest, most grotesque CREATURES ever conceived in the universe. Artoo and Threepio seem very small as they pause in the doorway to the dimly lit chamber. Light shafts partially illuminate the drunken courtiers as Bib Fortuna crosses the room to the platform upon which rests the leader of this nauseating crowd: JABBA THE HUTT. The monarch of the galactic underworld is a repulsive blob of bloated fat with a maniacal grin. Chained to the horrible creature is the beautiful alien female dancer named OOLA. At the foot of the dais sits an obnoxious birdlike creature, SALACIOUS CRUMB. Bib whispers something in the slobbering degenerate's ear. Jabba laughs horribly, at the two terrified droids before him. Threepio bows politely.
</DIRECTION>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THREEPIO>
<JABBA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bo Shuda!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JABBA>
<DIRECTION>
The robots jump forward to stand before the repulsive, loose- skinned villain.
</DIRECTION>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The message, Artoo, the message.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THREEPIO>
<DIRECTION>
Artoo whistles, and a beam of light projects from his domed head, creating a HOLOGRAM of LUKE on the floor. The image grows to over ten feet tall, and the young Jedi towers over the space gangsters.
</DIRECTION>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Greetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introducemyself. I am Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight and friend to Captain Solo. I know that you are powerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger with Solo must be equally powerful. I seek anaudience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's life.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Jabba's crowd laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With your wisdom, I'm sure that we can work out an arrangement which will be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant confrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift: these two droids.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<DIRECTION>
Threepio is startled by this announcement.
</DIRECTION>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did he say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THREEPIO>
<LUKE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Both are hardworking and will serve youwell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This can't be! Artoo, you're playing thewrong message.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THREEPIO>
<DIRECTION>
Luke's hologram disappears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jabba laughs while Bib speaks to him in Huttese.
</DIRECTION>
<JABBA>
<DIRECTION>
(in Huttese subtitled)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There will be no bargain.
	</DIALOGUE>

(in Huttese subtitled)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will not give up my favorite decoration. I like Captain Solo where he is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JABBA>
<DIRECTION>
Jabba laughs hideously and looks toward an alcove beside the throne. Hanging high, flat against the wall, exactly as we saw him last, is a carbonized HAN SOLO.
</DIRECTION>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Artoo, look! Captain Solo. And he's stillfrozen in carbonite.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THREEPIO>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DUNGEON CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of Jabba's Gamorrean guards marches Artoo and Threepio down a dank, shadowy passageway lined with holding cells. The cries of unspeakable creatures bounce off the cold stone walls. Occasionally a repulsive arm or tentacle grabs through the bars at the hapless droids. Artoo beeps pitifully.
</DIRECTION>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What could possibly have come over MasterLuke. Is it something I did? He never expressed any unhappiness with my work. Oh! Oh! Hold it! Ohh!
	</DIALOGUE>
</THREEPIO>
<DIRECTION>
A large tentacle wraps around Threepio's neck. He manages to break free, and they move on to a door at the end of the corridor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BOILER ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door slides open, revealing a room filled with steam and noisy machinery. The guard motions them into the boiler room, where they are met by a tall, thin humanlike robot named EV-9D9 (EVE-NINEDENINE). Behind the robot can be seen a torture rack pulling the legs off a screaming baby work droid. A second power droid is upside down. As smoking branding irons are pressed into his feet, the stubby robot lets out an agonized electronic scream. Artoo and Threepio cringe as the guard grunts to EV-9D9.
</DIRECTION>
<NINEDENINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are aprotocol droid, are you not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NINEDENINE>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am See-Threepio, human-cy...

	Yes or no will do.

<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Well, yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THREEPIO>
<NINEDENINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How many languages do you speak?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NINEDENINE>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am fluent in over six million forms ofcommunication, and can readily...
	</DIALOGUE>
</THREEPIO>
<NINEDENINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Splendid! We have been without an interpretersince our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NINEDENINE>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Disintegrated?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THREEPIO>
<NINEDENINE>
<DIRECTION>
(to a Gamorrean guard)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guard! This protocol droid might be useful. Fit him with a restraining bolt and take him back to His Excellency's main audience chamber.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NINEDENINE>
<DIRECTION>
The guard shoves Threepio toward the door.
</DIRECTION>
<THREEPIO>
<DIRECTION>
(disappearing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Artoo, don't leave me! Ohhh!
	</DIALOGUE>
</THREEPIO>
<DIRECTION>
Artoo lets out a plaintive cry as the door closes. Then he beeps angrily.
</DIRECTION>
<NINEDENINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a feisty little one, but you'll soonlearn some respect. I have need for you on the master's Sail Barge. And I think you'll fit in nicely.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NINEDENINE>
<DIRECTION>
The poor work droid in the background lets out another tortured electronic scream.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JABBA'S THRONE ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The court of Jabba the Hutt is in the midst of a drunken, raucous party. Sloppy, smelly monsters cheer and make rude noises as Oola and a fat, six-breasted female dancer perform in front of Jabba's throne. Jabba's alien band plays a wildly rhythmic tune on reeds, drums, and other exotic instruments. The Hutt rocks and swings in time with the music and toys with Oola's leash. The song comes to a close and the audience applauds.
</DIRECTION>
<JABBA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah! Do that again!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JABBA>
<BAND_MEMBERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One, two, three! Go, daddy, go! One, two,three!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAND_MEMBERS>
<DIRECTION>
The music swells. Oola and the fat female dancer perform as the alien band rocks. Jabba leers at the dancers and with a lustful gleam in his eye beckons Oola to come and sit with him. She stops dancing and backs away, shaking her head. Jabba gets angry and points to a spot next to him. Oola continues to protest and pull back against the tout leash.
</DIRECTION>
<JABBA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Da Eitha!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JABBA>
<DIRECTION>
The lovely alien shakes her head again and screams.
</DIRECTION>
<OOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Na Chuba negatorie Na! Na! Natoota...
	</DIALOGUE>
</OOLA>
<DIRECTION>
Jabba is furious and pulls her toward him, tugging on the chain.
</DIRECTION>
<JABBA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boscka!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JABBA>
<DIRECTION>
He pushes a button and, before the dancer can flee, a trap door in the floor springs open and swallows her up. As the door snaps shut, a muffled growl is followed by a hideous scream. Jabba and his monstrous friends laugh hysterically and several revelers hurry over to watch her fate through a grate. Oola tumbles down a chute and sprawls on the floor of the Rancor cage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Threepio cringes and glances wistfully at the carbonite form of Han Solo, but is immediately distracted by a gunshot offscreen. An unnatural quiet sweeps the boisterous gathering. On the far side of the room, the crush of debauchers moves aside to allow the approach of two guards followed by BOUSHH, an oddly cloaked bounty hunter, leading his captive, Han Solo's copilot, CHEWBACCA THE WOOKIEE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bib takes his place next to his disgusting master, and whispers into his ear, pointing at Chewbacca and the bounty hunter. Jabba listens intently, then the bounty hunter bows before the gangster and speaks a greeting in a strange, electronically processed tongue (Ubese).
</DIRECTION>
<BOUSHH>
<DIRECTION>
(in Ubese subtitled)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have come for the bounty on this Wookiee.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOUSHH>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, no! Chewbacca!
	</DIALOGUE>
</THREEPIO>
<JABBA>
<DIRECTION>
(in Huttese subtitled)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At last we have the mighty Chewbacca.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JABBA>
<DIRECTION>
Jabba lets out a loud, long, blood-curdling laugh and turns to Threepio, waving him closer. The reluctant droid obeys.
</DIRECTION>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, uh, yes, uh, I am here, YourWorshipfulness. Uh... yes!
	</DIALOGUE>
</THREEPIO>
<DIRECTION>
Jabba continues speaking, as Threepio nervously translates. Boushh listens, studying the dangerous creatures around the room. He notices BOBA FETT standing near the door.
</DIRECTION>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. The illustrious Jabba bids you welcomeand will gladly pay you the reward of twenty-five thousand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THREEPIO>
<BOUSHH>
<DIRECTION>
(in Ubese subtitled)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want fifty thousand. No less.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOUSHH>
<DIRECTION>
Jabba immediately flies into a rage, knocking the golden droid off the raised throne into a clattering heap on the floor. Boushh adjusts his weapon as Jabba raves in Huttese and Threepio struggles back onto the throne. The disheveled droid tries to compose himself.
</DIRECTION>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, oh... but what, what did I say?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Boushh)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, the mighty Jabba asks why he must pay fifty thousand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THREEPIO>
<DIRECTION>
The bounty hunter holds up a small silver ball in his hand. Threepio looks at it, then looks at Jabba, then back to the bounty hunter. The droid is very nervous and Jabba is getting very impatient.
</DIRECTION>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because he's holding a thermal detonator.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THREEPIO>
<DIRECTION>
The guards instantly back away, as do most of the other monsters in the room. Jabba stares at the silver ball, which begins to glow in the bounty hunter's hand. The room has fallen into a tense hush. Jabba stares at the bounty hunter malevolently until a sly grin creeps across his vast mouth and he begins to laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<JABBA>
<DIRECTION>
(in Huttese subtitled)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This bounty hunter is my kind of scum. Fearless and inventive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JABBA>
<DIRECTION>
Jabba continues.
</DIRECTION>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jabba offers the sum of thirty-five. And Isuggest you take it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THREEPIO>
<DIRECTION>
Bib and the other monsters study the bounty hunter and wait for his reaction. Boushh releases a switch on the thermal detonator and it goes dead.
</DIRECTION>
<BOUSHH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Zeebuss.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOUSHH>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He agrees!
	</DIALOGUE>
</THREEPIO>
<DIRECTION>
The raucous crowd of monsters erupts in a symphony of cheers and applause as the party returns to its full noisy pitch. Chewbacca growls. As he is led away we spot LANDO CALRISSIAN, disguised as a skiff guard in a partial face mask. The band starts up and dancing girls take the center of the floor, to the hoots of the loudly appreciative creatures.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Boushh leans against a column with gunfighter cool and surveys the scene, his gaze stopping only when it connects with a glare from across the room. Boba Fett is watching him. Boushh shifts slightly, cradling his weapon lovingly. Boba Fett shifts with equally ominous arrogance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DUNGEON CORRIDOR AND CELL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gamorrean guards lead Chewie down the same hallway we saw before. When a tentacle reaches out at the Wookiee, Chewie's ferocious ROAR echoes against the walls and the tentacle snaps back into its cell in terror. It takes all the guards to hurl Chewie roughly into a cell, slamming the door behind him. Chewie lets out a pathetic howl and bangs on the iron door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JABBA'S PALACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The palace is sitting in the light of the double sunset. On the road in front, a large toadlike creature flicks its tongue out for a desert rodent and burps in satisfaction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JABBA'S THRONE ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. The room is deserted, only the awful debris of the alien celebration giving mute witness to the activity here before. Several drunk creatures lie unconscious around the room, snoring loudly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A shadowy figure moves stealthily among the columns at the perimeter of the room and is revealed to be Boushh, the bounty hunter. He picks his way carefully through the snoring, drunken monsters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Han Solo, the frozen space pirate, hangs spotlighted on the wall, his coffin-like case suspended by a force field. The bounty hunter deactivates the force field by flipping a control switch to one side of the coffin. The heavy case slowly lowers to the floor of the alcove.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Boushh steps up to the case, studying Han, then turns to the controls on the side of the coffin. He activates a series of switches and, after one last, hesitant look at Han, slides the decarbonization lever. The case begins to emit a sound as the hard shell covering the contours of Han's face begins to melt away. The bounty hunter watches as Han's body is freed of its metallic coat and his forearms and hands, previously raised in reflexive protest, drop slackly to his side. His face muscles relax from their mask of horror. He appears quite dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Boushh's ugly helmet leans close to Han's face listening for the breath of life. Nothing. He waits. Han's eyes pop open with a start and he begins coughing. The bounty hunter steadies the staggering newborn.
</DIRECTION>
<BOUSHH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just relax for a moment. You're free of thecarbonite.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOUSHH>
<DIRECTION>
Han touches his face with his hand and moans.
</DIRECTION>
<BOUSHH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.

INT. MAIN GATE AND HALL - JABBA'S PALACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Noisily, the main gate lifts to flood the blackness with blinding LIGHT and reveal the silhouetted figure of LUKE SKYWALKER. He is clad in a robe similar to Ben's and wears neither pistol nor laser sword. Luke strides purposefully into the hallway. Two giant guards move to block Luke's path. Luke halts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luke raises his hand and points at the puzzled guards, who immediately lower their spears and fall back. The young Jedi lowers his hand and moves on down the hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bib Fortuna appears out of the gloom. He speaks to Luke as they approach each other, but Luke doesn't stop and Bib must reverse his direction and hurry alongside the young Jedi in order to carry on the conversation. Several other guards fall in behind them in the darkness.

Jabba is asleep on his throne, with Leia lying in front of him. Salacious sits by Jabba's tail, watching it wriggle. Leia is now dressed in the skimpy costume of a dancing girl; a chain runs from a manacle/necklace at her throat to her new master, Jabba the Hutt. Threepio stands behind Jabba as Bib comes up to the gangster slug.

The floor suddenly drops away, sending Luke and the hapless guard into the pit. The pistol goes off, blasting a hole in the ceiling. Jabba laughs and his courtiers join in. Leia starts forward but is restrained by a human guard-- Lando, recognizable behind his mask. She looks at him and he shakes his head "no."

<DIRECTION>
INT. RANCOR PIT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luke and the guard have dropped twenty-five feet from a chute into the dungeonlike cage. Luke gets to his feet as the guard yells hysterically for help. A crowd gathers up around the edge of the pit as the door in the side of the pit starts to RUMBLE open. The guard screams in panic. Luke looks calmly around for a means of escape.
</DIRECTION>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, no! The Rancor!
	</DIALOGUE>
</THREEPIO>
<DIRECTION>
At the side of the pit, an iron door rumbles upward and a giant, fanged RANCOR emerges. The guard runs to the side of the pit and tries futilely to scramble to the top. The hideous beast closes in on him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Rancor moves past Luke, and as the guard continues to scramble, the Rancor picks him up and pops him into its slavering jaws. A few screams, and the guard is swallowed with a gulp. The audience cheers and laughs at the guard's fate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The monster turns and starts for Luke. The young Jedi dashes away just ahead of the monster's swipe at him, and picks up the long arm bone of an earlier victim. The monster grabs Luke and brings him up to his salivating mouth. At the last moment, Luke wedges the bone in the monster's mouth and is dropped to the floor. The monster bellows in rage and flails about, hitting the side of the pit, causing an avalanche.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The monster crushes the bone in its jaws and sees Luke, who squeezes into a crevice in the pit wall. Luke looks past the monster to the holding cave beyond. On the far side of the holding cave is a utility door--if only he can get to it. The Rancor spots Luke and reaches into the crevice for him. Luke grabs a large rock and raises it, smashing it down on the Rancor's finger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HOLDING TUNNEL - RANCOR PIT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Rancor lets out a loud howl as Luke makes a run for the holding cave. He reaches the door and pushes a button to open it. When he succeeds, he sees a heavy barred gate between him and safety. Beyond the gate two guards look up from their dinner. Luke turns to see the monster heading for him, and pulls with all his might on the gate. The guards move to the gate and start poking at the young Jedi with spears, laughing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luke crouches (against the wall) as the monster starts to reach for him. Suddenly he notices a main door control panel halfway up the wall. As the Rancor moves in for the kill, Luke picks up a skull from the cave floor and hurls it at the panel. The giant overhead door comes crashing down on the beast's head, squashing it like a sledgehammer on an egg.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A startled gasp is heard from the stunned court. There's consternation at this turn of events. Heads look to Jabba, who is actually turning red with anger. Leia cannot suppress her joy. Jabba utters harsh commands to his guards and they hurry off.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. SARLACC PIT

The convoy moves up over a huge sand pit. The Sail Barge stops to one side of the depression, as does the escort skiff. But the prisoner's skiff moves out directly over the center and hovers. At the bottom of the deep cone of sand is a repulsive, mucous- lined hole with a huge beak protruding from it, surrounded by thousands of needle-sharp teeth and tentacles. This is the SARLACC. A plank is extended from the edge of the prisoner's skiff. Guards release Luke's bonds and shove him out onto the plank above the Sarlacc's mouth.

Jabba and Leia are now by the rail, watching. Threepio leans forward and the slobbering villain mumbles something to him. As Threepio steps up to a comlink, Jabba raises his arm and the motley array of intergalactic pirates fall silent. Threepio's voice is amplified across loudspeakers.

Artoo appears from below and zips over to the rail facing the pit. Below, in the skiff, Luke is prodded by a guard to the edge of the plank over the gaping Sarlacc. Luke looks up at Artoo, then gives a jaunty salute: the signal the little droid has been waiting for. A flap opens in Artoo's domed head.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luke is prodded and jumps off the plank to the cheers of the bloodthirsty spectators. But, before anyone can even perceive what is happening, he spins around and grabs the end of the plank by his fingertips. The plank bends wildly from his weight and catapults him skyward. In midair he does a complete flip and drops down on the end of the plank in the same spot he just vacated, but facing the skiff. He casually extends an open palm and -- his lightsaber, which Artoo has sent arcing toward him, drops into his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With samurai speed, Luke ignites it and attacks the guard who prodded him off the plank, sending the hapless monster screaming overboard. The other guards swarm toward Luke. He wades into them, lightsaber flashing. Lando struggles with another guard at the back of the skiff.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

EXT. SKIFF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Boba lands on the skiff and starts to aim his laser gun at Luke, who has freed Han and Chewie from their bonds. But before Boba can fire, the young Jedi spins on him, lightsaber sweeping, and hacks the bounty hunter's gun in half.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Immediately, the skiff takes another direct hit from the barge's deck gun. Shards of skiff deck fly. Chewie and Han are thrown against the rail.

For a moment, Luke is distracted, and in that moment, Boba fires a cable out of his armored sleeve. Instantly, Luke is wrapped in a strong cable, his arms pinned against his side, his sword arm free only from the wrist down. Luke bends his wrist so the lightsaber points straight up to reach the wire lasso and cuts through. Luke shrugs away the cable and stands free.
</DIRECTION>

Another blast from the Barge's deck gun hits near Boba and he is knocked unconscious to the deck, next to where Lando is hanging.

Luke is a little shaken but remains standing as a fusillade brackets him. The second skiff, loaded with guards firing their weapons, moves in on Luke fast. Luke leaps toward the incoming second skiff. The young Jedi leaps into the middle of the second skiff and begins decimating the guards from their midst.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chewie, wounded, tries to lift himself as he barks directions to Han, guiding him toward a spear which has been dropped by one of the guards. Han searches the deck as Chewie barks directions; finally he grabs hold of the spear.
</DIRECTION>

Boba Fett, badly shaken, rises from the deck. He looks over at the other skiff, where Luke is whipping a mass of guards. Boba raises his arm, and aims his lethal appendage.

The impact of the swing causes the rocket pack to ignite. Boba blasts off, flying over the second skiff like a missile, smashing against the side of the huge Sail Barge and sliding away into the pit. He screams as his armored body makes its last flight past Lando and directly into the mucous mouth of the Sarlacc. The Sarlacc burps. Chewie growls a weak congratulations to Han.

INT. SAIL BARGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leia turns from the spectacle outside, leaps onto Jabba's throne, and throws the chain that enslaves her over his head around his bulbous neck. Then she dives off the other side of the throne, pulling the chain violently in her grasp. Jabba's flaccid neck contracts beneath the tightening chain. His huge eyes bulge from their sockets and his scum-coated tongue flops out. The Exalted Hutt's huge tail spasms through its death throes and then slams down into final stillness. Leia struggles to free herself of her bondage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SKIFF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luke continues to destroy the aliens on the guards' skiff, as Han extends his spear downward to Lando, who is still dangling precariously from a rope on the prisoner's skiff.

</HAN>
<DIRECTION>
A major hit from the barge deck gun knocks the skiff on its side. Han and almost everything else on board slides overboard. The rope breaks, and Lando falls to the side of the Sarlacc pit. Luckily, Han's foot catches on the skiff railing and he dangles above Lando and the pit. The wounded Wookiee holds onto the skiff for dear life as another hit from the deck gun rocks the skiff violently.
</DIRECTION>
<HAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa! Whoa! Grab me, Chewie! I'm slipping.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAN>

Chewie grabs hold of Han's feet, holding him upside down, as Han extends the spear toward Lando, who is clutching to the side of the pit.
</DIRECTION>
<HAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grab it! L--Lando. Grab!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAN>
<DIRECTION>
Luke finishes off the last guard on the second skiff. He sees the deck gun blasting away at his helpless companions. Luke leaps from the skiff, across a chasm of air, to the sheer metallic side of the Sail Barge. Barely able to get a fingerhold, he begins a painful climb up the hull, when suddenly an ax smashes through a window an inch from his head. With Jedi agility, Luke grasps the wrist holding the ax and yanks the helpless guard through the broken window and into the deadly pit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The injured Chewie is reaching over the rail for the dangling Han, who is in turn blindly reaching down toward the desperate Lando. The Baron has stopped his slippage down the sandy slope of the Sarlacc pit by lying very still. Every time he tries to reach for Han, the loose sand moves him closer to his final reward.
</DIRECTION>
<HAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grab it! Almost... You almost got it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAN>

Another blast hits the front of the tilted skiff, causing Lando to let go of the spear.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDO>

</LANDO>
<DIRECTION>
Again Han extends the spear toward Lando.
</DIRECTION>
<HAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gently now. All... all right. Now easy, easy.Hold me, Chewie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAN>
<DIRECTION>
Lando screams. One of the Sarlacc's tentacles has wrapped tightly around his ankle, dragging him down the side of the pit.
</DIRECTION>
<HAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move,Lando.

<DIRECTION>
Han adjusts his aim as Lando lowers his head, and the fuzzy-eyed pirate fires at the tentacle. Direct hit. The tentacle releases Lando, and Chewie starts to pull them on board the skiff.
</DIRECTION>

	Chewie, Pull us up! Come on! Okay... up,Chewie, up!

<DIRECTION>
EXT. UPPER DECK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The deck gunners have Chewie and the desperate dangling human chain in their gun sights when something up on deck commands their attention: Luke, standing before them like a pirate king, ignites his lightsaber. The deck gunners have barely reached for their pistols before the young Jedi has demolished them. Immediately, Luke turns to see two more gunners (who have been uncovering a giant gun at the end of the barge) racing for him, firing their laser pistols.

<DIRECTION>
Artoo and Leia race for the exit, passing Threepio, who is kicking and screaming as Salacious Crumb, the reptilian monkey- monster picks out one of the golden droid's eyes.

<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not my eyes! Artoo, help! Quickly, Artoo. Oh!Ohhh! You beast!
	</DIALOGUE>
</THREEPIO>

Artoo zips over and zaps Salacious, sending him skyward with a scream, crashing into the rafters as Artoo, Leia, and Threepio (with his eye dangling from a wire) hurry off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. UPPER DECK - SAIL BARGE

Luke is warding off laser blasts with his lightsaber, surrounded by guards and fighting like a demon. Leia emerges onto the deck as Luke turns to face another guard.

</LUKE>
<DIRECTION>
A laser blast hits Luke's mechanical hand and he bends over in pain, but manages to swing his lightsaber upward and take out the last of the guards. He looks at the wounded hand, which reveals the mechanism. He flexes the hand; it still works.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Near the rail of the upper deck, Artoo and Threepio steady themselves as Threepio gets ready to jump. Artoo beeps wildly.
</DIRECTION>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Artoo, where are we going? I couldn'tpossibly jump.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THREEPIO>
<DIRECTION>
Artoo butts the golden droid over the edge and steps off himself, tumbling toward the sand.

Luke runs along the empty deck toward Leia and the barge gun, which she has brought around to point down at the deck.
</DIRECTION>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on!
	</DIALOGUE>

Luke has hold on one of the rigging ropes from the mast. He gathers Leia in his other arm and kicks the trigger of the deck gun. The gun explodes into the deck as Luke and Leia swing out toward the skiff.

EXT. SAND DUNE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Threepio's legs stick straight up from the dune where he landed. Next to it, Artoo's periscope is the only thing above the sand. The skiff floats above them and two large electromagnets dangle down on a wire. With a loud CLANG, both droids are pulled from the sand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DUNE SEA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The little skiff skips around the burning Sail Barge, which continues its chain of explosions. As the skiff sails off across the desert, the barge settles to the sand and disappears in one final conflagration.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DUNE SEA - LANDING AREA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A ferocious sandstorm blocks our view. Then, through the ROAR, we HEAR THE VOICES of our heroes. They emerge slowly from the veil of sand, pressing on against the wind. First come Artoo and Threepio, followed by Leia guiding Han, then Luke and Lando come into view, each supporting one side of the towering Chewbacca, who hobbles from his wound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Soon, they can make out some large vague shapes in the blowing sand. It is the Millennium Falcon and, parked beside it, Luke's trusty X-wing and a two-seated Y-wing. They must shout to be heard.
</DIRECTION>

As soon as the group huddles under the bulk of the Falcon, the wind dies down to something more describable as a severe weather condition. Threepio hits a switch, and the gang-plank lowers with a HUM.

<DIRECTION>
Thousands of Imperial troops in tight formation fill the mammoth docking bay. Vader and the officer walk to the landing platform, where the shuttle is coming to rest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shuttle's ramp lowers and the Emperor's Royal Guards come out and create a lethal perimeter. The assembled troops move to rigid attention with a momentous SNAP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, in the huge SILENCE which follows, the EMPEROR appears. He is a rather small, shriveled old man. His bent frame slowly makes its way down the ramp with the aid of a gnarled cane. He wears a hooded cloak similar to the one Ben wears, except that it is black. The Emperor's face is shrouded and difficult to see, except for his piercing yellow eyes. Commander Jerjerrod and Darth Vader kneel to him. The Supreme Ruler of the galaxy beckons to the Dark Lord.

Once again, Artoo finds himself waiting around in the damp environs of the swamp planet, and he's none too happy about it. He beeps disconsolately to himself and turns to look at Yoda's cottage. Warm yellow light escapes the oddly shaped windows to fight the gloom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. YODA'S HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tip of a walking stick taps hesitantly across the earthen floor of the cottage. Our view travels up the stick to the small green hand that clutches it, and then to the familiar face of YODA, THE JEDI MASTER. His manner is frail, and his voice, though cheerful, seems weaker.

	Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor,you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.

	When your father left, he didn't know your mother was pregnant. Your mother and I knew he would find out eventually, but we wanted to keep you both as safe as possible, for as long as possible. So I took you to live with my brother Owen on Tatooine... and your mother took Leia to live as the daughter of Senator Organa, on Alderaan.

Luke turns, and settles near Ben to hear the tale.

<BEN>
<DIRECTION>
(attempting to give solace with his words)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Organa household was high-born and politically quite powerful in that system. Leia became a princess by virtue of lineage... no one knew she'd been adopted, of course. But it was a title without real power, since Alderaan had long been a democracy. Even so, the family continued to be politically powerful, and Leia, following in her foster father's path, became a senator as well. That's not all she became, of course... she became the leader of her cell in the Alliance against the corrupt Empire. And because she had diplomatic immunity, she was a vital link for getting information to the Rebel cause. That's what she was doing when her path crossed yours... for her foster parents had always told her to contact me on Tatooine, if her troubles became desperate.

Hundreds of Rebel commanders of all races and forms are assembled in the WAR ROOM. WEDGE is among them. In the center of the room is a holographic model depicting the half-completed Imperial Death Star, the nearby Moon of Endor, and the protecting deflector shield.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MON MOTHMA, the leader of the Alliance, enters the room. She is a stern but beautiful woman in her fifties. Conferring with her are several military leaders, including GENERAL MADINE and ADMIRAL ACKBAR (a salmon-colored Mon Calamari). Lando moves through the crowd until he finds Han and Chewie, standing next to Leia and the two droids.

	The data brought to us by the Bothan spiespinpoints the exact location of the Emperor's new battle station. We also know that the weapon systems of this Death Star are not yet operational. With the Imperial Fleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to engage us, it is relatively unprotected. But most important of all, we've learned that the Emperor himself is personally overseeing the final stages of the construction of this Death Star.

	You can see here the Death Star orbiting theforest Moon of Endor. Although the weapon systems on this Death Star are not yet operational, the Death Star does have a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by an energy shield, which is generated from the nearby forest Moon of Endor. The shield must be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted. Once the shield is down, our cruisers will create a perimeter, while the fighters fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor.

Luke slams his bike into forward and starts firing away, having switched places with his pursuers in a manner of seconds. Luke's aim is good and one scout's bike is blasted out of control. It explodes against a tree trunk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The scout's cohort takes one glance back at the flash and shifts into turbo drive, going even faster. Luke keeps on his tail.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FAR AHEAD, Leia and the first scout are doing a highspeed slalom through the death-dealing trunks. Now Leia aims her bike skyward and rises out of sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The scout turns in confusion, unable to see his pursuer. Suddenly, Leia dives down upon him from above, cannon blasting. The scout's bike takes a glancing hit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leia moves in alongside him. The scout eyes her beside him, reaches down, and pulls out a handgun. Before Leia can react, the scout has blasted her bike, sending it out of control. Leia dives off as her bike explodes against a tree. The happy scout looks back at the explosion. But when he turns forward again, he is on a collision course with a giant fallen tree. He hits his brakes to no avail and disappears in a conflagration.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luke and the last remaining scoutcontinue their weaving chase through the trees. Now Luke moves up close. The scout responds by slamming his bike into Luke's. A fallen tree forms a bridge across their path. The scout zips under. Luke goes over the top and crashes his bike down on the scout's. Both riders look ahead - a wide trunk looms directly in Luke's path, but the scout's bike beside him makes it almost impossible for him to avoid it. Luke banks with all his might, leaning almost horizontal over the scout's bike, and is able to make it by, just clipping the tree. When he straightens, he and the scout discover that their two bikes have locked front vanes and are moving as one.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another big tree looms in Luke's path. He reacts instinctively and dives off his bike. The two bikes come apart a second before Luke's explodes against a tree. The scout sweeps out and circles back to find Luke.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luke rises from the undergrowth as the scout bears down on him and opens fire with his laser cannon. Luke ignites his laser sword and begins deflecting the bolts. The scout's bike keeps coming and it appears that in a second it will cut Luke in half. At the last instant, Luke steps aside and chops off the bike's control vanes with one mighty slash. The scout's bike begins to shudder, then, pitching and rolling, it rises up to slam directly into a tree in a giant ball of fire.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. SCOUT CAMPSITE - FOREST

Han, Chewie, and the droids, along with the rest of the squad, wait anxiously in the clearing. Artoo's radar screen sticks out of his domed head and revolves, scanning the forest. He beeps.

EXT. FOREST CLEARING - LEIA'S CRASH SITE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A strange little furry face with huge black eyes comes slowly into view. The creature is an EWOK, by the name of WICKET. He seems somewhat puzzled, and prods Leia with a spear. The princess groans; this frightens the stubby ball of fuzz and he prods her again. Leia sits up and stares at the three-foot-high Ewok. She tries to figure out where she is and what has happened. Her clothes are torn; she's bruised and disheveled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Ewok jumps up and grabs a four-foot-long spear, which he holds in a defensive position. Leia watches him as he circles warily and begins poking her with the sharp point of the spear.
</DIRECTION>
<LEIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cut it out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEIA>
<DIRECTION>
She stands up, and the Ewok quickly backs away.
</DIRECTION>
<LEIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not gonna hurt you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEIA>
<DIRECTION>
Leia looks around at the dense forest, and at the charred remains of her speeder bike, then sits down, with a sigh, on a fallen log.
</DIRECTION>
<LEIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, looks like I'm stuck here. Trouble is,I don't know where here is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEIA>
<DIRECTION>
She puts her head in her hands to rub away some of the soreness from her fall. She looks over at the watchful little Ewok and pats the log beside her.
</DIRECTION>
<LEIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, maybe you can help me. Come on, sit down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEIA>
<DIRECTION>
Wicket holds his spear up warily and growls at her like a puppy. Leia pats the log again.
</DIRECTION>
<LEIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I promise I won't hurt you. Now come here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEIA>
<DIRECTION>
More growls and squeaks from the little bear creature.
</DIRECTION>
<LEIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right. You want something to eat?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEIA>
<DIRECTION>
She takes a scrap of food out of her pocket and offers it to him. Wicket takes a step backward, then cocks his head and moves cautiously toward Leia, chattering in his squeaky Ewok language.
</DIRECTION>
<LEIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right. Come on. Hmmm?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEIA>
<DIRECTION>
Sniffing the food curiously, the Ewok comes toward Leia and sits on the log beside her. She takes off her helmet, and the little creature jumps back, startled again. He runs along the log, pointing his spear at her and chattering a blue streak. Leia holds out the helmet to him.
</DIRECTION>
<LEIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, it's a hat. It's not gonna hurt you.Look. You're a jittery little thing, aren't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEIA>
<DIRECTION>
Reassured, Wicket lowers his spear and climbs back on the log, coming to investigate the helmet. Suddenly his ears perk up and he begins to sniff the air. He looks around warily, whispering some Ewokese warning to Leia.
</DIRECTION>
<LEIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEIA>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly a laser bolt comes out of the foliage and explodes on the log next to Leia. Leia and Wicket both roll backwards off the log, hiding behind it. Leia holds her own laser gun ready, while Wicket disappears underneath the log. Another shot, and still no sight of anyone in the forest. Then Leia senses something and turns to find a large IMPERIAL SCOUT standing over her with his weapon pointed at her head. He reaches out his hand for her weapon.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOUT_l>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Freeze! Come on, get up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOUT_l>
<DIRECTION>
She hands the weapon over, as a second scout emerges from the foliage in front of the log.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOUT_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go get your ride and take her back to base.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOUT_1>
<SCOUT_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOUT_2>
<DIRECTION>
The second scout starts toward his bike, as Wicket, crouched under the log, extends his spear and hits the first scout on the leg. The scout jumps and lets out an exclamation, and looks down at Wicket, puzzled. Leia grabs a branch and knocks him out. She dives for his laser pistol, and the second scout, now on his bike, takes off. Leia fires away and hits the escaping bike, causing it to crash into the first scout's bike, which flies end over end and explodes. The forest is quiet once more. Wicket pokes his fuzzy head up from behind the log and regards Leia with new respect. He mumbles his awe. Leia hurries over, looking around all the time, and motions the chubby little creature into the dense foliage.
</DIRECTION>
<LEIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, let's get outta here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEIA>
<DIRECTION>
As they move into the foliage, Wicket takes the lead. He shrieks and tugs at Leia to follow him.

Too late. The Wookiee has already pulled the animal from the stake. SPROOING! The group finds itself hanging upside down in an Ewok net, suspended high above the clearing.

When the Ewoks see Threepio, they let out a gasp and chatter among themselves. Threepio speaks to them in their native tongue. The Ewok nearest him drops his spear and prostrates himself before the droid. In a moment, all the Ewoks have followed suit. Chewie lets out a puzzled bark. Han and Luke regard the bowed creatures in wonder. The Ewoks begin to chant at Threepio.

EXT. FOREST - SERIES OF SHOTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A procession of Ewoks winds through the ever-darkening forest. Their prisoners - Han, Luke, Chewie, and Artoo - are tied to long poles and wrapped in vines, cocoonlike.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Each pole is carried on the shoulders of several Ewoks. Behind the captives, Threepio is carried on a litter, like a king, by the remaining creatures.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FOREST WALKWAY - MOON FOREST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The procession moves along a shaky, narrow, wooden walkway, high in the giant trees. It stops at the end of the walkway, which drops off into nothingness. On the other side of the abyss is a village of mud huts and rickety walkways, attached to the giant trees. The lead Ewok takes hold of a long vine and swings across to the village square; the other Ewoks follow suit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. EWOK VILLAGE SQUARE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The procession winds its way into the village square. Mother Ewoks gather their babies up and scurry into their huts at the sight of the newcomers. The group stops before the largest hut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Han, Luke, Chewie, and Artoo are still bound to their poles. Han is placed on a spit above what looks like a barbecue pit and the others are leaned against a tree nearby. Threepio's litter/throne is gently placed near the pit. He watches with rapt fascination. Han, Luke, and Chewie are less than fascinated.
</DIRECTION>
<HAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have a really bad feeling about this.

<DIRECTION>
Chewie growls his concern.

Suddenly all activity stops as LOGRAY, the tribal Medicine Man, comes out of the big hut. He examines the captives carefully, goes to join Threepio, whose throne has been placed on an elevated platform. A larger, gray-haired Ewok, CHIEF CHIRPA, is examining Luke's lightsaber with great curiosity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Logray speaks to Threepio and the assemblage of fuzzy Ewoks, pointing to the prisoners tied to the stakes. The Ewoks begin filling the pit under Han with firewood.

Threepio talks to Chirpa and Logray, who listen and shake their heads negatively. The Medicine Man gestures toward the prisoners and barks some orders. Several Ewoks jump up and pile more wood on the barbecue with vigor. Leia trades frantic looks with Luke and Han.

The Ewoks fall back in terror from the floating throne. Now Threepio begins to spin as though he were on a revolving stool, with Threepio calling out in total panic at his situation.

</THREEPIO>
<DIRECTION>
Chief Chirpa yells orders to the cowering Ewoks. They rush up and release the bound prisoners. Luke and Han enfold Leia in a group embrace. Luke notices the spinning Threepio, with Artoo beeping up at him, and slowly lowers the golden droid and the throne to the ground. Logray orders the little droid cut down. Artoo crashes to the ground. When the Ewoks set him upright, the little droid is fighting mad. Artoo beeps a blue streak at the nearest Ewok, and begins pursuing him, finally getting close enough to zap him with an electric charge. The Ewok jumps two feet in the air and runs away, screaming. A small group of Ewoks surround the giant Wookiee, scratching their heads and marveling at his height.

A glowing fire dances in the center of the spartan, low-ceilinged room, creating a kaleidoscope of shadows on the walls. Along one side, a group of ten Ewok elders flank Chief Chirpa, who sits on his throne. The Rebels sit along the walls of the hut, with Threepio between the two groups and Wicket and Teebo off to one side.

Threepio is in the midst of a long, animated speech in the Ewok's squeaky native tongue. The Ewoks listen carefully and occasionally murmur comments to each other. Threepio points several times at the Rebel group and pantomimes a short history of the Galactic Civil War, mimicking the explosion and rocket sounds, imitating Imperial walkers. Throughout the long account, certain familiar names are distinguishable in English: Princess Leia, Artoo, Darth Vader, Death Star, Jedi, Obi-Wan Kenobi. Artoo begins beeping excitedly at Threepio.
</DIRECTION>
<THREEPIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Artoo. I was just coming to that.

</THREEPIO>
<DIRECTION>
Threepio continues with: Millennium Falcon, Cloud City, Vader, Han Solo, carbonite, Sarlacc, bringing the history up to the present time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the end of it, the Chief, Logray, and the elders confer, then nod in agreement. The Chief stands and makes a pronouncement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The drums begin to sound, and all the Ewoks stand with a great cheer and screeches.

EXT. EWOK VILLAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The walkway is deserted now. The windows of the little huts glow and flicker from the fires inside. The sounds of the forest fill the soft night air. Luke has wandered away from the Chief's hut and stands staring up at the Death Star. Leia finds him like that.
</DIRECTION>
<LEIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Luke, what's wrong?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEIA>
<DIRECTION>
Luke turns and looks at her a long moment.

<LEIA>

Luke moves close and his manner is gentle. And very calm.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Your father?

	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<DIRECTION>
Leia is very disturbed by this. She moves away, as if to deny it.
</DIRECTION>
<LEIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Luke, don't talk that way. You have a powerI--I don't understand and could never have.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEIA>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too.In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<DIRECTION>
Leia stares into his eyes. What she sees there frightens her. But she doesn't draw away. She begins to understand.
</DIRECTION>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. It's you Leia.

</LUKE>
<LEIA>
	<DIALOGUE>

</LEIA>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you don't. You've always been strong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<LEIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But, why must you confront him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEIA>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<DIRECTION>
They hold each other close and look at each other, brother and sister.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leia holds back her tears as Luke slowly lets her go and moves away. He disappears onto the walkway that leads out of the village. Leia, bathed in moonlight, watches him go as Han comes out of the Chief's hut and comes over to her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leia is crying, her body trembling. He realizes only now that she is crying.

EXT. FOREST - IMPERIAL LANDING PLATFORM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An Imperial shuttle floats down from the Death Star and lands gracefully on the huge platform.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now, an Imperial walker approaches the platform from the darkness of the forest. The whole outpost - platform, walkers, military - looks particularly offensive in the midst of this verdant beauty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. IMPERIAL LANDING PLATFORM - LOWER DECK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Darth Vader walks down the ramp of the shuttle onto the platform, into an elevator, and appears on a ramp on a lower level. He walks toward another ramp exit and is met by two troopers and a commander with Luke, in binders, at their center. The young Jedi gazes at Vader with complete calm.
</DIRECTION>
<COMMANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is a Rebel that surrendered to us.Although he denies it, I believe there may be more of them, and I request permission to conduct a further search of the area.

<COMMANDER>

Vader looks at Luke, turns away and faces the commander, taking the lightsaber from the commander's hand.

The officer and troops withdraw. Vader and Luke are left standing alone in the oddly tranquil beauty of the place. The sounds of the forest filter in upon them.

(turning to face him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That name no longer has any meaning for me.

</VADER>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is the name of your true self. You've onlyforgotten. I know there is good in you. The Emperor hasn't driven it from you fully. That is why you couldn't destroy me. That's why you won't bring me to your Emperor now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<DIRECTION>
Vader looks down from Luke to the lightsaber in his own black- gloved hand. He seems to ponder Luke's words.
</DIRECTION>
<VADER>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see you have constructed a new lightsaber.

Vader ignites the lightsaber and holds it to examine its humming, brilliant blade.
</DIRECTION>
<VADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your skills are complete. Indeed, you arepowerful, as the Emperor has foreseen.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Han, Leia, Chewie, the droids, and their two Ewok guides, Wicket and Paploo, have reunited with the Rebel strike squad. The entire group is spread through the thick undergrowth. Below them is the BUNKER that leads into the generator. Four Imperial scouts, their speeder bikes parked nearby, keep watch over the bunker entrance. Chewie growls an observation, and Paploo chatters away to Han in Ewok language.

EXT. BUNKER - ENTRANCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paploo has slipped out of the undergrowth near where the Imperial scouts are lounging. He silently swings his furry ball of a body onto one of the scout's speeder bikes and begins flipping switches at random. Suddenly, the bike's engine fires up with a tremendous ROAR. Paploo grins and continues flipping switches. The scouts leap up in surprise.

EXT. FOREST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paploo sails through the trees, more lucky than in control. It's scary, but he loves it. When the Imperial scouts pull within sight behind him and begin firing laser bolts, he decides he's had enough. As he rounds a tree, out of their sight, Paploo grabs a vine and swings up into the trees. A moment later, the scouts tear under him in pursuit of the still-flying, unoccupied bike.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BUNKER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Han sneaks up behind the remaining Imperial scout, taps him on the shoulder and lets the scout chase him behind the bunker into the arms of the waiting Rebel strike team. Han returns to the front, and taps out a pattern on the bunker door's control panel. Everyone stands out of sight, police-style, as the door opens. Han and Leia peek inside. No sign of life. The group enters the bunker silently, leaving one lookout behind.
</DIRECTION>

Luke ignites his lightsaber and screams in anger, rushing at his father with a frenzy we have not seen before. Sparks fly as Luke and Vader fight in the cramped area. Luke's hatred forces Vader to retreat out of the low area and across a bridge overlooking a vast elevator shaft. Each stroke of Luke's sword drives his father further toward defeat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Dark Lord is knocked to his knees, and as he raises his sword to block another onslaught, Luke slashes Vader's right hand off at the wrist, causing metal and electronic parts to fly from the mechanical stump. Vader's sword clatters uselessly away, over the edge of the platform and into the bottomless shaft below. Luke moves over Vader and holds the blade of his sword to the Dark Lord's throat. The Emperor watches with uncontrollable, pleased agitation.

Blinding bolts of energy, evil lightning, shoot from the Emperor's hands at Luke. Even in his surprise, the young Jedi tries to use the Force to deflect them. At first he is half successful, but after a moment the bolts of energy are coming with such speed and power the young Jedi shrinks before them, his knees buckling. The wounded Vader struggles to his feet, and moves to stand at his master's side.

Although it would not have seemed possible, the outpouring of bolts from the Emperor's fingers actually increases in intensity, the sound screaming through the room. Luke's body writhes in pain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vader grabs the Emperor from behind, fighting for control of the robed figure despite the Dark Lord's weakened body and gravely weakened arm. The Emperor struggles in his embrace, his bolt- shooting hands now lifted high, away from Luke. Now the white lightning arcs back to strike at Vader. He stumbles with his load as the sparks rain off his helmet and flow down over his black cape. He holds his evil master high over his head and walks to the edge of the abyss at the central core of the throne room. With one final burst of his once awesome strength, Darth Vader hurls the Emperor's body into the bottomless shaft.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Emperor's body spins helplessly into the void, arcing as it falls into the abyss. Finally, when the body is far down the shaft, it explodes, creating a rush of air through the room. Vader's cape is whipped by the wind and he staggers, and collapses toward the bottomless hole. Luke crawls to his father's side and pulls him away from the edge of the abyss to safety. Both the young Jedi and the giant warrior are too weak to move.
