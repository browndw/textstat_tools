EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VARIOUS EXTRA CLOSE-UPS of this luxurious patchwork of brilliant greens:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A POLISHED BRASS SPRINKLER HEAD

pops up from the ground and begins to water the already dew- soaked lawn.

FLEET OF DUCKLINGS

At the bottom of a water hazard.

<DIRECTION>
PALM FRONDS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a neat they sway, revealing the barren desert that surrounds the artificial oasis. The sun already bakes the air. We hear the opening guitar strains of the Kim Deal-Kurt Cobain suet of "WHAT I DID FOR LOVE," as we CRANE DOWN the palms to
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BRAND-NEW TITLEIST 3 BALL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just on the edge of the rough. A pair of yellow trousers moves in. An iron confidently addresses the ball, and chips it out. The trousers walk out after it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HANDS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Digging dirt out of the grooves of the iron's face with a golf tee, while on the way to the green. Both hands are gloved, instead of one, and the gloves are black.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
YELLOW TROUSERS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a squat over the ball, sizing up the curvy, fifty-foot journey to the hole. The figure positions himself and the putter above the ball, then pops the ball lightly. The ball rolls and bobs with purpose toward the hole, dodging hazards and finding lanes, until it finally falls off of the green and into the hole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE GLOVED HAND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sets the ball on the next tee. The figure moves to a leather golf bag. The hands pull the wipe rag off of the top of the bag and drop it on the ground, reach into the bag, drawing out a compact SNIPER RIFLE, affixed with a long silencer. The figure drops one knee down onto the rag, the other foot firmly setting its spikes. We move the figure to see the face of the sniper, concentrating down the scope in his half- squat. He is MARTIN BLANK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We SWING AROUND behind his head to look down the barrel with him. Four-hundred yards away, on another part of the course, another green is barely visible through groves of trees and rough. Three miniscule, SILVER-HAIRED FIGURES come into view. One of them, in a RED SWEATER sets up for first putt. He could be an investment banker, or an arms trader.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARTIN'S ARM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flinches, and a low THUNK reports from the rifle. A second later in the distance, the

RED SWEATER'S HEAD

Seems to vanish from his shoulders into a crimson mist. His body crumples to the green.

Returns the rifle to the bag, pulls out a driver, moves to the tee and whacks the ball. He watches its path and whispers absently...

INT. CLUB HOUSE PATIO - LATER

The outdoor post-golf luncheon area of an elite Texas golf club. Martin sits in on the fringes of a conversation between a group of executive types. CLUB MEMBER #1 has a Buddha-like peace in his eyes through the philosophical talk.

<CLUB_MEMBER_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the way life is. The only meaning and value is what we create. Through structure, and discipline. Though they seem to limit our freedom, they actually give us great comfort. Your problem is you're looking for some great answer. Some ultimate truth. When what you really should do is go to work and go home.

Martin sits in a first class seat, the tray table flipped down. On the left side of the tray is a stack of magazines of all kinds - Sports Illustrated, Mademoiselle, Wired, Rolling Stone, National Review, Spin, National Geographic, and on. He draws one off the top, and flips through it, impassively taking in images and reading nothing. When he is done with one, he discards it into the empty seat next to him and draws another-- Martin's way of instantly and massively uploading the world around him:

Toothless hockey player in triumph, Sony product parade, crouched starving child with vulture in the background, supermodel in suede, Tic Tacs, living former Presidents, arm in arm, smiling, etc.

	That's it then. That's it. I've always been alone. That's why I'm a good driver. I can handle it. See, I can think on my feet. I survive, I'm a thinker. And I can sit there in front of your house for two hours and it don't bother me. Some people can't do it! Some people are ranting and raving, "Tell them fuckin' people to get out here and get in this car, I can't-- I want a go!" Where you gonna go? You're gonna wind up back in your garage at seven o'clock at night. You ain't going nowhere. You leave your house in the morning you get back to your house in the evening. What's the big deal, right?

INT. HOTEL ROOM, NEW YORK CITY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sedate and well-appointed four-star suite on the Upper East Side. Martin stands in front of one of the open windows watching the canopied entrance of an elegant high-rise across the street. He lifts an eye rinse cup to his eye and tilts it back. A cellular phone RINGS, interrupting him. He moves to the desk and draws one of three phones from his briefcase, depresses a scrambler module, flips it open, and listens for a moment.

<MARTIN>

	If it's not there, I can't proceed. Tell them.

MARTIN'S P.O.V./SCOPE- WINDOW #2

A few blocks down, small even through the high-powered scope, is your average BICYCLE MESSENGER dressed in lycra racing gear, weaving through traffic toward us. Slung low across his right hip is a black canvas bag. The Messenger's hand is hidden in it. The other phone begins to RING.

<MARTIN>

	Hold on a second, Tom. I got my hands full here.

the bicycle Messenger bears down on the group of men, drawing a Mac-10 submachine gun from his bag. The group see him-- just as Martin's sniper FIRE explodes the Messenger's chest. Two of the Bodyguards collapse onto their boss. The other two open fire on the Messenger as he wipes out horribly into a parked car in front of them.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BODYGUARD sits outside an apartment door. A muffled but dire scream is heard from within and he is on his feet, gun in hand. An exit door in the hallway slams open revealing Martin, his gun already pointed at the Bodyguard. The Bodyguard levels his at Martin.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>

She raises a thick brown dossier from the top of her desk and puts it down again. Martin moves through a door to his private office.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARTIN'S OFFICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Martin goes into his office and sits at his desk. On the walls are a couple of boring prints of tallships. A bookshelf holds trappings of a loose attempt at a cover-- a few shipping manifests, sealane tables, and other specialized reference books on import/export. He sits and stares.

DR. OATMAN sits in the window. He is Kris Kringle-esque, and wears a sheepskin vest, rough-hewn shirt, faded Levis, and old Frye boots. Oatman nods with the suave understanding of a man happy to collect fifty thousand in fees before asking a tough question.

<DR_OATMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think what you fear Martin is domesticity. It's the greatest fear that men have who belong to Western Culture. It's centuries old. Like King Phillip, in the 11th or 12th century who decided one day that he was so bored with his dreary life at home with his wife he thought, "Well, wouldn't it be great if we hit the road and fought... oh... the Saracens." So he put the word out and was amazed when a million men signed up and all of them wanted to go and fight in distant lands and do terrible things to people rather than stay at home with their families.

A MAN walks down the street. He is FELIX, a bookish, forgettable man in his forties, wearing Le Coq Sportif sweats and shoes. He looks as if he has a dark cloud over his head. Martin's seen him somewhere, and doesn't like what he remembers. Martin's POV TRACKS him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FELIX'S P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he walks down the street, he spots the Country Squire, and eyes Lardner and McCullers in the front seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARTIN'S P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
follows Felix's eyes to Lardner and McCullers and catches their look. Their eyes lock, neither wanting to betray that they've made each other. They all do a pretty good job. His P.O.V. swings to a square-jawed, hale fellow wearing dark sunglasses who is approaching directly and only a few feet away. The man is going for something in his breast pocket...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reaches into his own jacket, most likely for a gun....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE MAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
pulls out a glasses case, and takes off his shades-- He is PAUL SWIDERSKI.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARTIN AND PAUL

Martin relaxes.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Hell, I would've voted for you, but there's all this apple sauce stuck in my phone... I don't wanna talk about it. How the hell are you?!

	Hey. Give me a break.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PAUL'S BMW - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Martin and Paul rive through Grosse Pointe, Michigan: Wide streets lined with huge, shady oaks. Castle-like homes on golf-course green lawns. A comfortable, Midwestern Beverly Hills. They are cruising their old haunts, Paul smoking a joint.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This won't take but a minute. I just gotta hold their hands for a final walk-through. I'll take them in, get 'em out, then you and I can grab a little quality time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
Martin looks out the window, breathing in the past.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goddamn, It's good to see you. I was afraid you joined a cult or something. I half-expected you to come back to town in a fennel wreath and paper pants.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
Paul offers Martin the joint. He declines.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There was no money in it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Martin regards Paul archly.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>

(grinning)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what happened to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Same thing that happened to you-- I stopped poutin' there on the sidelines. Got in. Got on the team. I joined the working week, you slick fucking asshole, so why don't you valet park your high horse and take it easy on your old buddy, Paul.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<MARTIN>

MARTIN'S P.O.V.

<SOUTHTEC_GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

MARTIN AND THE GUARD

</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So when are you authorized to use deadly force?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<SOUTHTEC_GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, a 'course, taxes provide your basic service-- police and whatnot. But our customers need a little more than just that, you understand? This badge doesn't mean that I am a peace officer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOUTHTEC_GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
The woman turns at Martin and smiles. Martin smiles back.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So it's not a meaningful symbol, or anything. That badge is just the badge of your company. If I look suspicious on your customers' property-- well, under those heightened circumstances you have the authority to, ah... To shoot me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<SOUTHTEC_GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To shoot you. Correct.

Paul looks at Martin and the Guard, inviting them into the sell.

<SOUTHTEC_GUARD>

</SOUTHTEC_GUARD>

All look to Martin....

<MARTIN>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When my time comes, if it ever does, I want a beautiful, normal place like this... and a wife like you...

All are confused. Martin thumbs to the guard.

Martin and Paul cut through a particularly charming neighborhood.

	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>

MARTIN'S P.O.V.

A sprawling gingerbread mansion rises into view. A long and winding driveway cuts through thickly wooded property to the house.

They roll slowly by Debi's house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They drive in silence for a beat. Paul suddenly swerves to the shoulder, jams the brake, and turns on Martin.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ten years. What happened!?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I freaked out, joined the Army, worked for the government, and went into business for myself... I'm a professional killer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.

Paul, satisfied, gets back on the road.

	Professional killer, huh? Does that come with a good HMO?

</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROAD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul makes a turn. They approach a large car dealership. The sign above it says
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"DESTEPHANO'S BAVARIAN MOTOR WORKS".
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He sells BMW's?

</MARTIN>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He sold me this bad boy.

<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How could you put your hard-earned dollars into the hands of the class bully?

</PAUL>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mein Dealer.

</MARTIN>

Paul slows outside the lot. BOB DESTEPHANO-- a big, angry- looking man in an expensive suit-- stands in the lot, puffing up amidst his stable of expensive cars.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! Bob! The car's running great.

</PAUL>
<BOB>

EXT. RADIO STATION - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Martin climbs out of Paul's car and begins to walk toward his own. Paul calls after him.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See you at the left-a-boy-came-back- a-man-made-good party.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
Martin nods him off. Paul pulls away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARTIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stands across the street from the radio station, looking at Debi in the window... Martin draws a thin rifle scope from his back pocket, and lifts it to his eye...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARTIN'S P.O.V. - SCOPE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
of Debi, in the crosshairs, bored, tapping a pencil to the beat of an unheard song.

<DIRECTION>
MARTIN

<DIRECTION>
dejected. He puts the scope away and gets in his car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. 7-11 - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Martin walks into the store, looking around once again at his old home. To the left of the door, a typical suburban teenage SKATEBOARDER is lost in the "Mortal Combat" video game and something too loud from his walkman. Carl, still working the double, nods to Martin.
</DIRECTION>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I help you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARL>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's done is done.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Martin moves up one aisle to the gum rack. He picks out a pack of Beaman's and unwraps a stick as he heads to the counter. On the way, he makes a black Town Car pulling into a spot next to his own. He immediately changes course, and bee-lines for a rear aisle where he ducks down...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FELIX
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Comes through the door, drawing a Mac-10 for each hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARTIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
grabs the gum out of his mouth and sticks it onto the bottom of the Glock .9mm he has produced from somewhere in his suit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CARL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
grabs the cash drawer, sets it on the counter, and puts his hands up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SKATEBOARDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plays on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FELIX AND CARL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Felix shoots CARL DEAD on his way toward
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARTIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bolts up the cooler aisle. Bursts of FIRE follow him, taking out each freezer door behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARTIN AND FELIX
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXCHANGE FIRE John Woo-style between the aisles of the cramped store. Felix delivers a close-to-home burst as he jumps the counter, sending Martin diving out of view.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARTIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
pinned behind the Slurpee machine, pauses to reload his now two Glock nines. Martin steals a glance to get a bead on Felix and is met with a salvo that rocks the Slurpee machine, spattering him with several flavors... and that's all he can take. Martin comes up BLASTING with both guns, but all that's left of Felix is swinging doors and squealing tires.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Martin moves to the cashier island, low to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SKATEBOARDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Twitches and jerks, still absorbed in his game and oblivious to the surrounding carnage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CASHIER ISLAND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Martin crawls through the waist-level swinging door and moves to Carl.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CARL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is really dead. Martin rolls him over to check it out and finds
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BOMB
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
under the corpse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARTIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flips the corpse back on top of the device and leaps the counter toward the doors. He grabs the shoulder or the Skateboarder, who shrugs him off, annoyed--
</DIRECTION>
<SKATEBOARDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the fuck, man?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKATEBOARDER>
<DIRECTION>
The video game screen explodes. Shot full of Martin's bullets. The Skateboarder reacts backward and Martin jerks him out of the double doors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. 7-11 - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Skateboarder is running like crazy, and Martin's car is peeling out in reverse as the 7-11 is blown to hell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MARTIN'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Martin's hair is matted with Slurpee as he tries to drive and cool out. He sees his do in the mirror, pulls out a comb and starts to comb it back into a slick Pat Riley style.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RADIO STATION - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

Martin walks in, not looking half bad, considering. Debi looks up from some reading. "Naïve Melody" by the Talking Heads plays in the studio.

Under a crisp and starry night, a man and a woman sit around a campfire. As we MOVE CLOSER we see that the woman is Marcella reading, "Women Who Run With Wolves." She tends to s'mores on the campfire, assembles one, and hands it to MONTY, her young outdoorsman boyfriend. Monty is perched on a small boulder, engaged in a Tai-Chi-like ritual, wearing Patagonia's finest. There is a path of crystals leading from the fire to the boulder. In the background is a tent and a Nissan Pathfinder. Monty's watch goes off.

Martin hangs up. He moves up to the air vent, deciding to get down to business. He pries it open, and withdraws his briefcase, putting it down on the bed and propping it open. He looks at the unopened dossier for a moment, flips it over in his hands, and tosses it on the bed.

Martin draws a nasty little PPK pistol from his waist, and levels it at Grocer under the table-- but Grocer is already drawing his pistol down there, and there is an instant Mexican breakfast stand-off.

A waitress approaches.

<WAITRESS>

	Hi. Welcome to B.I. McCafferty's. My name is Melanie and I'll be your server this morning. Let me tell you about some of our specials. Today we have the "Alfalfa on My Mind," our feature omelette. And there's our "Gatsby's West Egg Omelette." And if you're in the mood for something different there's the "I left my heart in San Franchezie."

Martin and Grocer's eyes remain locked.

	I didn't get into this business to have "associates." And I don't want to join your Goddamned union. "Loner-- " "Loner gunman." Get it? "On my own." That's the whole point. Why don't you become a cop, or something. You can drink coffee in the morning... with friends!

	Martin, I don't know where you've been since you abandoned my daughter ten years ago, and I don't care. It was good that you left, and I'm glad you did. So what do you want to talk about? You've grown up a bit. Maybe I had you figured wrong.

	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_NEWBERRY>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I took the other road. I'm more of a self-reflective young lion who does business with lead-pipe cruelty and goes home to drink light beer in milky-eyes isolation. I love sports and sex and have no real relationships with anyone. And you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<MR_NEWBERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, you know me, Martin. I'm the same old sell-out baby-boomer, exploiting the oppressed I got shot for at Kent State. But why don't we have a drink and forget the whole thing?

	I guess, though, you know, if you look at it Mike, that park is a beautiful park, I've gone to that park many times - I've had the greatest time of my life at that ballpark and let's face it, I tell you this, Mike, by the sixth inning, if you're having the fun you should be having at Tigers Stadium, you don't even know what the hell's going on anyway...

</DARIUS>
<DEBI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No--

</DEBI>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--Yes. Actually we just bought that little Frank Lloyd Wright on Pine Avenue... Debi's a social worker and I mow down insurance claims at Aetna--

</MARTIN>
<DEBI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We haven't seen each other since high school.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBI>
<DARIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I figured. You two look too happy together. I shouldn't say that though, I'm married... So, Martin-- what are you up to these days? What do you do for a living?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARIUS>
<DIRECTION>
Debi perks up; this should be interesting.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm in pro-active international relations. It's a very specialized company. We execute economic investment opportunities. Sort of economic clean-up... with an emphasis on personnel. It's boring, you know, it's boring. I don't like to talk about it because I don't think what a man does necessarily reflects who he is...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Martin begins to draw strange looks from all over the table. Martin may be in trouble.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I've always tried to refrain from a black-and-white moral lexicon--you know, good, bad, right, wrong--I've been more interested in the gray areas.

</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. Martin pushes on.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But that's no way to live. I guess you've got to just take the leap of faith. Believe in something. Fuck it.

</MARTIN>
<DARIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sounds complicated, Martin. Are you happy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARIUS>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<DEBI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know, Martin. It sounds like you're feeling compromised. Live the way you want. The only thing that's inexcusable, to me, is cynicism. That's the biggest cop-out there is.

<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to agree with you Dennis. It's good to see that the owners are willing to put the franchise behind a black head coach or QB when for years in the league they've been kept out of the thinking positions and relegated mainly to the physical game.

</MARTIN>
<DEBI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Soft. I'll take the junkie otter, clearly! I'd let the little beast scratch and claw all he wants... Okay. Would you rather make love to the candied corpse of Phyllis Diller--

INT. HALLWAY - LATER

Martin and Debi come out of the Nurse's Office. The post- coital mood is broken as they hear The Human League's "Don't You Want Me, Baby?" blasting from the gym. Martin and Debi tune in on the song for a moment, unhappy at remembering that particular moment in pop music history. Debi looks to Martin, something must be done about it.

Bob and several others from the muscle-to-fat crew play a drunken scrimmage with a papier-mache table ornament footbal that is coming unwound. Bob quarterbacks and begins to recite a long, complicated, and forgotten play. Martin approaches from behind Bob and glides through the ad-hoc line-up, continuing down the hall.

Martin walks down a silent, deserted hall of lockers and classroom doors. The only sounds are his footsteps and the echoed strains of Iggy Pop's "Wild Child" from the distant gym. He stops at locker number 1963 and flips the dial: Right- back left-right again. It opens. He pops up the steel false ceiling in the empty locker, fishes his hand in the opening, and withdraws what he is looking for: an ancient joint. He holds it up and examines the now brown and dried reefer. He grinds it into dust in his hand.

rips it down from the wall with his free hand, wraps it around Felix, stuffs the body into his open locker, and slams it shut. He pulls off his shoes and socks, puts a sock over each hand like mittens, and wipes up the small pool of blood. He stuffs the socks into his pockets, takes off down the hall, and bangs through the doors.

The door bangs open and light pours into the room from behind Martin. He negotiates the cart over the dirt floor and stops next to the furnace that heats the swimming pool.

He cocks his head toward the door anticipating a... KNOCK. He freezes, then plucks a gun tapped under a desk, and moves toward the door, pointing. Halfway to the door, his face and body slacken. He lobs the gun onto the bed. With everything gone wrong, there is nothing left to defend. He goes to the door and opens it, body relaxed, expecting a bullet...

	I was sitting in my house on prom night wearing that Goddamned rented tuxedo, a corsage in one hand, a bottle of champagne in the other. So I was just sitting there, and then the whole night flashed before my eyes, and it struck me like a bullet in the head-- I realized, finally, and for the first time, that... I wanted to kill somebody. So I figured because I loved you so much, that'd it'd be a good idea if I didn't see you anymore. But now I'm different.

He turns and points the gun at the front door and FIRES two shots through it, leaving two baseball-size holes in the door.
