EXT. NEW YORK - DECEMBER 1999 - LATE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are moving through a thicket of skyscrapers. In the dim light we see one building, then its reflection against another building. We swoop past the Empire State Building lit in Christmas red and green, catch a glimpse of the Christmas tree in Rockefeller Center.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On screen we see: NEW YORK CITY DECEMBER 15 1999. High atop a tall glass building we find another Christmas tree.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We close on the Thief whose face is concealed behind a sleek black-visored helmet with night-vision goggles. From a pack, the Thief takes a climbing rope, clamps it with a carabiner around a post, then dials a distance into the special ratchet mechanism.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Thief steps to the edge and LEAPS over, plunging past the glass windows. After a terrifying free fall, suddenly the rope gears down smoothly, bringing the Thief to a stop at a window pane, a dizzying sixty floors above the street. Through the glass, we see a CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Thief drills out bolts holding the window in place. Then one is stuck! In a heartstopping move the Thief turns upside down, torques on the recalcitrant bolt! Uhnnn! It comes free!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Thief replaces the existing bolts with custom bolts buffered with rollers, pries at the window corners and pops the pane free. Then the Thief rolls the pane onto the rollers, leaving just enough room to slip into...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PETROTEX CORP - LATE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Board of Directors Suite of a large multinational corporation, dominated by an obsidian table ringed with leather chairs. An Alarm Box softly pulses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Thief points a Remote at the alarm. The Remote runs possible codes at speed on display panel, until the right one stops. The Thief clicks the Remote. Off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The kind of art that gilds greed with taste lines the walls. Ignoring it, the Thief picks up a VASE OF LILIES and carries it across the room to a side table by the window. The Thief carefully tilts the stems so that the lilies hang over the lip of the vase, away from the window, then exits the Board Room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RECEPTION AREA - LATE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Lichtenstein, some plants, a large map of the world with tiny red lights indicating branch offices around the world. A Christmas tree with some uniformly wrapped presents carefully arranged beneath it. Keeping an eye on a set of double glass entry doors, the Thief pauses behind a Henry Moore sculpture. Through the doors we see a desk where sits a SECURITY GUARD, his back to us.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALL/ INT. RECEPTION ROOM - INTERCUT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Security Guard reads and half-watches the Monitors. On one we see the Reception Area and the vaguest shadow of the Thief. The Guard looks at his book, the Thief begins to move. The Guard glances back at the Monitor, the Thief jumps back. Then the Guard returns to the book. On the Monitor the Thief darts across the room and into a door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATHROOM - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Which is a bathroom. Hmmm. But that is exactly where the Thief wants to be. Out of the backpack the Thief takes a small drill and begins to make a hole high on the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Above the Security Guard, the drill pierces the wall, leaving just a dusting of sheetrock on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATHROOM - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Thief feeds a tiny tube up to the edge of the just- drilled hole. Turns a valve on a small canister.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Security guard yawns, tries to focus on his reading.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NEW YORK BUILDING - LATE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From a distant perspective we see the shadowy Thief exit the bathroom as the Security Guard puts his head down on the desk. The Thief enters another room off the Reception area-- the Chairman's Office.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHAIRMAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pictures of the Chairman with politicians and celebrities line one wall. Across from the desk, a Jasper Johns map of the United States. Above the desk, a SMALL PAINTING in an old gilt frame. A REMBRANDT. The pride of the collection, a nude woman reading a letter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Thief takes out a small periscope mirror and some right angled cutters. Carefully slides the mirror behind the painting, manipulates the mirror with one hand, the cutters with another. Finds the alarm. Snips it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Moving quickly now. The Thief rolls the canvas in acid-free paper. Takes a cylindrical tube from the backpack, pulls out another Canvas, fits it carefully into the stolen painting's now-empty frame. The Thief stares at it through the opaque helmet visor. Approves. Slips the rolled-up stolen canvas into the empty tube. Leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Before we follow the thief, we linger to see the replacement canvas...ELVIS. On black velvet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY - LATE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With the Thief now, out the reception area and into the hall, where the drugged guard sleeps, to a Mail Chute built into the wall. As the Thief opens the chute we hold on the last line of a mailing label: KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Thief pops the labeled tube down the chute.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BUILDING WINDOW - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Thief disappears out the open window. The window closes, becoming...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BUILDING WINDOW - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another window, in which we see reflected the lens of a telescope and, in that lens, the image of the office where the thief has just been. A silhouetted FIGURE is looking through the telescope.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the scope's lens. Close detail of the Office where the thief had been. We see light fall into the room as the Figure exits a door and softly closes it. The Image lightens and DISSOLVES INTO:

INT. WEBBER INSURANCE - MAIN OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The video plays live on a large monitor in a big bullpen of a room, all Herman Miller partitions and work stations butted together, row upon row of them. This is where the world's biggest insurance companies track down major theft losses. FOUR TECHNICIANS work at computer monitors, calling up security plans, art data, details on possible suspects.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HECTOR CRUZ enters, crisp, professional, an ex-FBI man who thinks he's smarter than anybody else, and is almost right. Cruz glances at the cops working in the Board Suite, knows they'll never figure this out.

INT. WEBBER ASSURANCE - GIN'S CUBICLE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of dozens of identical work stations. VIRGINIA BAKER, early thirties, sits at the work station where she spends most of her life. She's dressed in typical no-nonsense insurance attire. Cruz peers over the partition.

Cruz has an easy, ironic demeanor that hides a steel will. There's something eerie about him: he seems to be right inside Gin's head.

	Exactly.

He gestures at the video feed of the crime scene.

	Bathsheba reading King David's letter...

She hits a button. The view SNAPS to tight resolution. The image of ROBERT MACDOUGAL, 60: tall, wide shoulders, the build of an ex-sailor and the elegance of a diplomat. Between him and Cruz is some ancient enmity.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Elvis has not left the building.

	Copies are copies. This is a MacDougal. I can feel it.

But it's better than anything else he has, so he reaches for the phone.

	All right. I'll get in touch with London and Geneva, get Europol and the ALR on it.

He walks away. She stands up in her carrel, looks around at the narrow confines of her life, at the identical cookie- cutter work stations surrounding her. She slides the keyboard into the drawer with a soft thwatch of finality. She whoops with joy, which plays over--

EXT. LONDON - BOAT - DAY

SMASH CUT to Gin, finishing her yell in the bow of a large speed boat in the middle of the Thames. The wind is in her face, London before her in all its glory. She's out of the office. On the case. On her own!

A black London cab stops in front of the famous auction house. Nervous, Gin gets out, fumbles with her change, drops some on the street.

She approaches the sliding glass doors, takes a deep shaky breath, pulls herself together. She enters the building. The glass doors close behind them. On the doors is etched the Sotheby name.

Beneath a banner announcing "The Summerfield Collection-- Treasures of Ancient China", an AUCTIONEER takes bids from an international big-money crowd, including a formidable Chinese WOMAN with a dog, and Robert MacDougal. He's bidding on a 6th Century temple scroll.

<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you going to tell me where we're going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly and smoothly, he reaches down and grabs her bag.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<DIRECTION>
One eye on the road, he begins to rummage. We approach a large MODERN BUILDING with a CHRISTMAS TREE in front. A police kiosk guards the entrance.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just want to see who I'm with. Can't be too careful...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
She snatches the bag away from him, he grabs it back, the car swerves and crashes violently into the Christmas tree! The tree falls across the street.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, dear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. KOMITSU BUILDING - DAYY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mac and Gin get out of the car. She goes to inspect the damage and we go with her. She stares at the dented car, then looks up to see Mac walking away toward the building.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<DIRECTION>
Bystanders gather around. So does the cop from the kiosk.
</DIRECTION>
<COP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this your car, Miss?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, dammit, but I wasn't driving--
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(yelling at Mac)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come back!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<DIRECTION>
A crowd has begun to gather around the fallen Christmas tree. Traffic backs up. Horns sound. In the b.g. Mac strides toward the modern building. We hear a police siren, coming towards us.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. KOMITSU BUILDING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Mac enters the building, he clips on a the high-tech i.d. badge Romy gave him. Slips on the horn-rimmed glasses. Does look a little like Clark Kent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KOMITSU BUILDING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mac approaches a security desk where a GUARD sits next to a large TV screen. On the walls are blowups of computer chips and large photographs of the production process.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mac slips his i.d. card into the reader. We see his photograph. CLEARED. The Guard glances at Mac, then at the screen, then at the hubbub outside around the fallen tree.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looks like they took down our Christmas tree a little early this year.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
The Guard pushes a buzzer. Mac goes inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. KOMITSU BUILDING - DAY - TEN MINUTES LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A wrecker winches the Christmas tree out of the road. A policewoman has just asked an exasperated Gin to count backwards by twos.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--eight, six, four, two--
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<DIRECTION>
Her cell phone rings.

</GIN>
<POLICEMAN>

EXT. KOMITSU/INT. WEBBER INSURANCE - INTERCUT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cruz is in his office, a big photograph of Mac on the wall behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<CRUZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So how's it going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRUZ>
<DIRECTION>
Gin sticks her finger toward her nose, fumbles a little with the phone. This does not impress the policewoman.
</DIRECTION>
<CRUZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gin?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRUZ>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great! Terrific!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<DIRECTION>
To Gin's dismay, the policewoman pulls out a Breathalyzer. Covering the mouthpiece, Gin protests to the policewoman.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I wasn't driving.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<POLICEWOMAN>

</POLICEWOMAN>
<GIN>
<DIRECTION>
(to Cruz)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me, one second.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<DIRECTION>
She breathes into the tube. Suddenly we hear ALARMS from inside the Komitsu building! AHOOGAH! AHOOGAH! The police leave Gin and rush toward the building.
</DIRECTION>
<CRUZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did I remind you to keep a low profile?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRUZ>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<CRUZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. Romy said she made the intro. What's Mac like?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRUZ>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Putty in my hands.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<DIRECTION>
ALARMS screech! In the b.g. a panicky crowd of employees flee the building! We hear screaming, yelling.
</DIRECTION>
<CRUZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm filled with confidence. Remember, this guy has more moves than a black cat in a graveyard. Don't roll your hole card till you see what he's holding.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRUZ>
<DIRECTION>
In the b.g. Gin sees Mac exit as the police battle past him to get inside.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever that means, believe me, I won't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<DIRECTION>
She clicks off the phone. As a frazzled Gin stares at the crowd, she sees Mac get into a cab and drive away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gin enters her dingy, corporate rate room, a complete contract to the exuberant girl we saw arrive on the Thames. It's been a bad day.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stops, surprised. Looks around the room. No luggage. Nothing. Checks the number on her key.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL - MAC'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wearing reading glasses, Mac sits quietly reading an art book. There's a loud pounding on his door. Carrying his art book, Mac comes to the door, opens it for Gin.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wrecked my car! You left me there!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You seemed to be handling things quite nicely.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nicely? They gave me a Breathalyzer!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You passed, surely?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course I passed. And then I get back and my luggage's been stolen!

</GIN>
<MAC>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're joking. Really?

</GIN>
<MAC>

	That's terrible. Come in, come in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
She enters, paces, still upset.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>

	It's amazing what's getting stolen these days. Your bags. That Rembrandt.

</MAC>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<MAC>

He pours some whiskey.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Speaking of art, wasn't there something you wanted to discuss with me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, yes--
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have a drink. Do you good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
She takes a sip. Ahh. Still flustered, she reaches into her bag, trying to make the transition to business.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Surely you don't want to go back to that room, do you? After all this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
There's a pirate's smile on his face. Gin thinks she gets it. Okay, here it comes. The usual pass. She puts her folder back into the bag.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not really--
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<DIRECTION>
He looks into her eyes. She is quite beautiful.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If it would make you feel any better, you can sleep here if you like.

</MAC>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very direct, aren't we?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just trying to be helpful. In a way I got you into all this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't mind at all. Being into this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<DIRECTION>
She means him. She smiles, very close now.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	May I say something, quite personal?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<DIRECTION>
She's turning on all the charm now.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've got lipstick on your teeth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
Nightmare! Embarrassed, Gin closes her mouth, runs her tongue over her teeth. Mac heads for the bedroom door, not entirely hiding that pirate smile.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll just slip into something a little more comfortable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
He shuts the door. She checks herself in the mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the bedroom door bursts open! Out comes Mac, his jacket on.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry about the bill. It's all taken care of.

</GIN>
<MAC>

<DIRECTION>
Desperate, she pulls a photo out of her bag.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mac!

He's already opened the door, but he turns.

	How about I get your laundry too?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I can't trust you to pick up a simple vase, how can I trust you with the most valuable piece of Chinese art in the world?

It's a challenge. It only takes her a moment to decide.

	Fine. I'll do it.

<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go into that warehouse right there. Ask for Haas. It's 200,000 pounds. You can pay with this.

He hands her a credit card. Gin takes it, gets out of the car. He hands her a cellular phone.

Gin passes through the crowds of vendors and customers and enters the warehouse. By the door are parked a Jeep Cherokee and a large Triumph motorcycle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HAAS WAREHOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>

Filled with architectural scavenging. A large sinister MAN (QUINN) moves a mantel away from the entrance.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Haas?

<DIRECTION>
Quinn looks blank, a little menacing.

EXT. BOROUGH MARKET/INT. HAAS OFFICE - INTERCUT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Approaching Mac's car is A MAN passing out leaflets and wearing a sandwich board reading "Repent, the Millennium is at Hand". And then, "13 Days until the End of the World". The 13 is scrawled on a sheet of paper tacked to the sign.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In HAAS' office. A few MOUSE TRAPS on the floor, some antique letter openers and knives on the desk. In contrast to Quinn, HAAS is small and feral.
</DIRECTION>
<HAAS>

She puts her hand in the case, pulls out a film canister.

<GIN>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll take it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<DIRECTION>
Fumbling with one hand and just a little pissed, she pulls the card out of her purse. Haas stares at the card as if it's roadkill.
</DIRECTION>
<HAAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAAS>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A credit card.

	I know it's a credit card. What do you think this is, fucking Harrod's?

</HAAS>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I've never seen rats at Harrod's.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<DIRECTION>
The tension makes her smile. And that infuriates Haas. he rips an antique knife out of its scabbard.
</DIRECTION>
<HAAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ever see one of these? It's a Gurkha knife. You're not meant to put it back without drawing blood.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAAS>

We're back on Mac, who's still on his cell phone.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is there a problem?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
Haas has stuck his knife under Gin's chin. She can barely talk.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He says he won't take a credit card.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<DIRECTION>
He sticks it even more, forcing her up on her tiptoes. The hand holding the phone drops to her side.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell him it was just a joke. I'll bring up the money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
But the phone is at Gin's side. She can't hear him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Millennium Man walks up to Mac's car, spewing fire and brimstone. Mac rolls the window up, sets down the phone, turns to the back seat to get a briefcase.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My bag. The money's in my bag.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<HAAS>
	<DIALOGUE>

Mac has the case with the money in it in his hand. Talks again into the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell him I'm on my way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
But no one hears. Holding the knife under her chin, Haas looks down into the bag.
</DIRECTION>
<HAAS>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"No rats at Harrod's."
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(dead serious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I may bloody stick you anyway. That'd be a laugher, eh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAAS>
<DIRECTION>
He means it. As he looks through her bag she swings the vase and SMASHES it against the side of his hand!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Over the phone, Mac hears the crash! Snaps to, alert!
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gin? Gin!

But his voice comes out of a phone lying on the floor next to Haas's inert body.

<DIRECTION>
INT. HAAS WAREHOUSE - DAY - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrying her bag and grasping the film case in her hand, Gin runs down the back stairs!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quinn charges at her, blocking the way out the front, where Mac is. She heads into a narrow concrete passage! Quinn is right behind her, implacable, scary, a half smile on his face like he is enjoying this.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She runs up some concrete steps, hits a padlocked gate, covered over the top with a mesh screen. She shakes it like a caged animal. And here comes Quinn, honing in on her! She scrambles up, kicks upward at the wire cage above the gate, knocks it off!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just as Quinn reaches the gate, she lurches over, falls down on top of a parked car. Thump! Jumps onto the top of another car. Thud! Then runs toward the market!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BOROUGH MARKET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gin runs down one row of stalls and up another. It's a maze. Quinn is right behind her. She scrambles over a huge mound of onions, leaps down into another stall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But Quinn keeps coming. She runs down an alley. Turns a corner. Dead end! Quinn is right behind her!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She scrambles up a fence, but he kicks the supporting post out, and the fence collapses!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She struggles to her feet, runs over the fallen fence. Quinn throws it out of the way and keeps after her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's in a maze of pillars now, dodging from one to another. Out of breath, she pauses behind a pillar. No Quinn. Trains rattle overhead. Traffic speeds by on the other side of an impassable partition.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Getting her breath, she darts out again, but Quinn is right there! He grabs her roughly, steers her into an empty stall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quinn pulls out a scary looking knife. This can't be happening. Not in the middle of a public market. But it is. No one is paying any attention. Quinn readies the knife.
</DIRECTION>
<QUINN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take a good look. I'm the last face you'll ever see.

His evil grin. Gin looks over his shoulder.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice try, Love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUINN>
<DIRECTION>
But he turns and BAM! Mac has driven up in the car, holds out his fist, smashes Quinn in the kidneys!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quinn goes down!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gin jumps into the car. Quinn struggles to his feet. Still without getting out of the car, Mac jams his elbow into Quinn's stomach!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mac pulls away, but he can barely drive faster than a walk. It's claustrophobic and scary. All these people are in the way!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And here comes Quinn, through the crowd, implacable fury on his face. He leaps forward and stabs at the canvas roof with his knife. RIP! The blade slices through the roof! Right by Gin's head! Gin screams! Mac swerves the Jag!
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>

Quinn cuts around behind the stalls. Speeding up, Mac drives right down the fish aisle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Quinn appears right in front of them, wielding a pipe from some scaffolding. Crash! He smashes the tail light! CRASH! He smashes the side window! They're trapped in the damn car!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mac spots an opening in the crowd, steps on the accelerator and pulls away from Quinn.

<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then why couldn't you have just given me the damn cash?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wanted to see how you handled a bit of pressure.

</MAC>

At that moment Haas emerges from the warehouse, blood on his face, pistol in hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BANG! He fires at the car. Gin screams. People in the market hurl themselves to the ground, all except the Millennium Man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mac throws the Jag into reverse and swerves into a tight turn. Screech! The car narrowly misses the Millennium Man, whose leaflets go flying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mac guns into the carpark. Haas jumps into the Grand Cherokee. Quinn lowers the barriers. Mac's trapped!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mac swerves through the carpark, a maze of pillars crisscrossed by overpasses. Haas races behind him in the Cherokee. And then so does Quinn, on the motorbike!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Grand Cherokee and the motorcycle are right behind them! Mac is corralled! Hemmed in!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He races into a warehouse. Ahead we see the STEEL DOORS coming down. Mac guns the Jaguar toward the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You might put your head down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
Mac races for the narrowing opening!
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Noooo!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<DIRECTION>
Mac tears under the closing steel door! It RIPS the top off the Jaguar! Gin raises her head, the wind now in her face.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's coming out of your share.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
Quinn slides the bike on its side, squeezes under the closing gate and stays on their tail.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's a turn just up here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
He races down a narrow street, then swings the Jag to the right. WHOA! He screeches to a stop. The road dead-ends into a modern building.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was a turn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
He throws the car into reverse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mac races forward, confronted by a Truck pulling out of an alley. Mac slams on brakes! Gin is thrown forward.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I must give you full marks for initiative.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
Gin sits back up again.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks a lot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>

	<DIALOGUE>
	So how'd you get in the business?

</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BOROUGH MARKET - STREETS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gin is thrown from side to side as the Jaguar races on.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My father--
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<DIRECTION>
Zooom! Down a narrow street, just wide enough for a single vehicle. Mac sees a delivery truck being unloaded by a forklift, dead ahead!
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My father went to prison. Embezzlement.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<DIRECTION>
The Jaguar does a 270 degree spin and heads down another street, the Grand Cherokee suddenly right behind them again!
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you learned at Daddy's knee.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I learned not to get caught.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<DIRECTION>
Mac screeches faster past the Prison Museum, then bursts out into a larger street which leads down into a tunnel. The motorcycle and Cherokee are right behind them!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mac is caught between two slow moving vehicles, unable to pass them. He's helpless to prevent Haas pulling alongside them. Haas' window rolls down. His gun is pointed directly at Gin's head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's only one way out! Mac swerves to the right and heads down the tunnel the wrong way!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TUNNEL - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Jag heads into the semi-darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TUNNEL - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Haas and Quinn pull up by the median, stare into the tunnel.
</DIRECTION>
<HAAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No way I'm going in there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAAS>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TUNNEL - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mac is in the tunnel, weaving through the incoming traffic from one lane to the other! It's incredibly dangerous.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I hate to state the obvious, but isn't this a one way?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<MAC>
<DIRECTION>
(thoroughly enjoying himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're only going one way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
Then we race around a bend and there, coming right at us, are two huge semis, side by side. Mac's face falls.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're going to die, aren't we?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not the one to ask.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
Steam brakes scream, horns shriek! Mac hits his brakes, hard!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The huge trucks fill the screen, thirty tons of angry chrome and steel, coming right at them!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TUNNEL - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Haas and Quinn listen to the panicked horn, the squealing of brakes. Haas grins.
</DIRECTION>
<HAAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bye-bye, Mac.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAAS>
<DIRECTION>
Boom! Suddenly we see Mac blowing out of the tunnel at 60 m.p.h., IN REVERSE!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He jerks the wheel to the left, throwing the Jag dead into the motorbike! It bounces off Haas's Grand Cherokee and back into the roadway. Haas bangs on the door, trying to get it open, but it's banged shut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quinn jumps out to recover the bike from the road but then the huge trucks emerge from the tunnel and smash over the bike, crushing it!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SPECTACULAR LONDON BUILDING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Jag pulls up. Mac and Gin get out. Mac gives one last look at his battered car as he opens the trunk.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's four thousand for the top, six thousand for the bumpers, God knows how much for the body work, you have to go to art school to work on one of these--
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls a valise out of the trunk.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just put it on my bill.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll find some warmer clothes in here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about yours?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>

They head inside.

EXT. BUILDING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They emerge up some concrete steps onto the roof. Saint Paul's is spread out beneath them.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where to now, Bungee Jumping?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
He turns her toward a helicopter waiting on a pad. As they walk toward it she opens the valise.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't wait to see what you picked out for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<DIRECTION>
She checks out the valise, astonishment on her face.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These are my clothes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Certainly not mine.

	<DIALOGUE>
	You bastard!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When you were dealing with the wreck of your rental car, I did a little job. Four prototype copper super chips, value, five million each. Come on, get in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
She gets in the helicopter.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your bag is in Hotel Security. One of those chips is inside. An anonymous phone call from me, your rental car at the crime scene, it's not a pretty picture.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
The rotors are turning fast now.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's entrapment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Entrapment is what cops do to robbers. Blackmail is what robbers do to schmucks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
Off Gin's look, Mac lifts the stick up. The helicopter plunges off the top of the building, gains airspeed, and flies away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HELICOPTER - MAGIC HOUR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The long steady vibration has put Gin to sleep. Mac nudges her awake. She looks around, eyes barely open, still half asleep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He gestures down at the ground. She looks, and then her eyes open wide. It is...dramatic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SAFEHOUSE - MAGIC HOUR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Deer running across a heath, crumbling stone walls, and then a stunningly beautiful small castle, walls glowing lavender in the twilight, set next to a coal gray loch rimmed with mountains wreathed in a purple haze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is so hauntingly lonely, that Gin is speechless.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SAFEHOUSE - FRONT DOOR - MAGIC HOUR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The helicopter in the b.g., Mac and Gin walk up to the castle. Like its owner, the house is craggy and forbidding on the outside. Mac turns the knob and walks in. No key, no code, no nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No security? Not even a lock?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps I have a more optimistic view of human nature than you do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SAFEHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They enter what was once a baronial hall. Warm stone walls glowing golden in firelight from a walk-in stone fireplace. An eclectic mixture of contemporary and antique furnishings, nothing ostentatious, everything carefully selected for its uniqueness and comfort, all fitting together in harmony.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the walls are a few classic paintings. A Renoir. A Turner. A regimental banner from a Scottish regiment. Every item reveals a piece of Mac's life and who he is. This is our first glimpse of the private man. Gin lingers, looking at everything, overwhelmed by this amazing place.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've never seen anything like this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't suppose you have. Let's keep moving, shall we?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SAFEHOUSE - GIN'S ROOM - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sets her bag down on the bed in a guest room decorated with neutral colors and lined with bookcases bulging with old books, all of which look read.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
He turns to go.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<DIRECTION>
She comes closer to him. She's in the post-adrenaline buzz of an amazing day, the castle is incredibly romantic, and so is he.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never thanked you for saving my life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't mention it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
She's vulnerable now, doesn't even bring up that it was his fault she was in danger in the first place. He turns to go.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't I get a bedtime story?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<DIRECTION>
She really is hard to resist.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like what? Prince Charming?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, I always preferred the big, bad wolf.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<DIRECTION>
She's being outrageous now, she can't help it.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My dear girl, I'm old enough to be your father.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
She's beyond outrageous now.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He always tucked me in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<DIRECTION>
Oh boy. Mac doesn't want to touch that with a ten-foot pole.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hmmm. Well, you'll have to tuck yourself in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But it's so early.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<DIRECTION>
The pouty little girl now. Nothing seems to be working.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never mix business with pleasure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about Romy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Romy? Oh, she's strictly business.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really. Breakfast at six. Bring your bungee gear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
He leaves. She stands in the doorway, watching him go, totally unable to figure him out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SAFEHOUSE - LOCH - EARLY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mac is swimming in the gray early morning light. Gin watches Mac swim for a moment as she takes in the grounds: the stone walls, the hedgerows, the green lawn stretching down to the loch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mac gets out, throws on a robe over his wetsuit.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're late.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm dressed.

</GIN>
<DIRECTION>
She pointedly looks at his wetsuit.

<GIN>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And good morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Morning. Let's get started.

</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
He heads away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SAFEHOUSE-PLANNING ROOM - DAY - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A converted snooker room. Tools in the cue racks. A long table top with candlesticks. Specially designed hooks and bins for gear, large bulletin boards, various monitors and bits of electronic equipment. Mac stands next to a bulletin board covered with photographs of the castle and sets of plans, all marked up with red magic marker.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twelve seconds--

He writes 12 sec on the plans.

<MAC>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

He writes 3db.

He writes 6 min on the board.

(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--to neutralize a state of the art set of interlocking PIRs--
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>

He writes 20 cm on the plans.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--to get into the Mask case with its unbreakable code--
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which I have.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which you hope you have. And then get back out through the same security system. Still without making a bloody sound.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<DIRECTION>
We expect him to say that is the craziest damn thing I ever heard. He pauses for a moment, as if trying to find words to express this. But he doesn't.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hmmmm. Interesting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
He stares at the plans, lost in thought.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the exhibit ends--?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Christmas night, with a party in honor of the Mask.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A week. We'll need every single day. We'll got that party for a final recce.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
This is most definitely not her plan.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can't. We've got to go sooner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One week.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But why? It's risky. And we have all the plans.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Prepare for surprises, you won't be surprised.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
He studies the drawings and the photographs, then points to a lake in front of the castle.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the way in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the lake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know it's the lake, dear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
He draws a line from the lake to the Palace.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The first Duke dug a tunnel as an escape route--just in case. They made the lake a hundred years later. Flooded the tunnel.

She doesn't like that idea.

</MAC>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're partners.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Precisely. I steal the Mask, you get a finders fee. At ten percent, that should be worth two or three million. Not too bad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I've got the code for the Mask security.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<MAC>

	No.

</GIN>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine. It's almost been interesting meeting you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
He starts taking down the plans, the photographs, putting things away.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is a two-man job. You need a sensor expert. Me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This isn't some Rocky Mountain print you steal from a Burger King, my dear.

He looks up at her. She has his attention now.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I stole it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<DIRECTION>
What the hell?
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, you're a smart girl, but you're an amateur. Whoever stole that Rembrandt was a professional, not some wee slip of a girl. So let's not kid each other.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
Mac sits down at the end of the table and begins to put away some of the documents lying on it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Furious, Gin stares at him. He is so maddening and dismissive. Nothing she says is going to change his mind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She takes the table cloth runner, grasps it in her hands, and jerks it off the table! Books, papers, candlesticks fly. Mac's eyebrow goes up. You have my attention.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She walks to the end of the room, takes the measure of the table, then runs toward it and BOOM! BOOM! Does two front handsprings! Coming right at him!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then does a full twisting layout vault! Right over his head! Lands on her feet behind him!
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pretty good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For a wee slip of a girl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<DIRECTION>
She's won him over.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Rembrandt--that was very impressive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was perfect.

</GIN>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perfect was it?

He gets up, makes a show of walking slowly and creakily over to the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How'd you get the painting out?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mailed it. Down their own mail tube. Simple. Effective. Safe.

</GIN>
<MAC>

He takes out a rolled-up canvas.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you be referring to this Rembrandt?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
He displays the familiar painting. Now it's her turn to be shocked. And ours as well.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God. No.

</GIN>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why rob the Penthouse when the mailroom is on the ground floor?

	<DIALOGUE>
	You're too easily impressed with yourself. I believe I've mentioned that before.

</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
Gin reaches for the Rembrandt.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Someone was expecting that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>

He studies the mailing label.

A delivery van drives up. A TRADESMAN steps out. He's mid- forties, black. Mac meets him at the door.
</DIRECTION>
<TRADESMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Delivery for Robert MacDougal, Esquire.

He says it with just a bit too much deference.

EXT. SAFEHOUSE - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

Carrying a box, the Tradesman walks into the kitchen. This is THIBADEAUX, a Cajun who carries himself with authority. The Tradesman veneer didn't fit him too well: he's too dangerous. Mac is there to meet him.

Thibadeaux is watching her through the telescope. An idea, call it a suspicion, comes to him.
</DIRECTION>
<THIBADEAUX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are keeping this business, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THIBADEAUX>
<DIRECTION>
Mac gives nothing away.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need you to get one more thing for me. A dress, elegant but sexy. I'd say she's a size six who wears a size four. Maybe a Chanel.

Mac looks out to Gin.

Thibadeaux's delivery van drives away. Getting out of the loch, Gin walks toward the house and catches just a glimpse of the van and its driver.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SAFEHOUSE - DAY - FEW MINUTES LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her hair still wet from swimming, Gin stares at the furnishings and casually arranged mementos, the way a woman considers how a place is decorated to be a window into the owner's soul. Mac enters, carrying a box of gear.

She throws his line back at him.

	Bullshit I'm afraid. Secrets are what make us human.

EXT. SAFE HOUSE/INT. SAFE HOUSE - DAY/NIGHT - INTERCUT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Measuring precisely, Gin and Mac string red yarn into a maze in the living room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mac runs blade det cord along a piece of concrete.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Boom! The det cord explodes. Mac checks a decibel meter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mac checks the depth of the cut in the concrete with a ruler, makes some notes in his Notebook.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mac and Gin squat underneath some planks set on scaffolding five feet off the floor. Mac begins to chant, rhythmically, as he tapes strips of blade det cord over a square 18" on a side outlined on the wood with magic marker.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A one and a two and a three and a four...Stand back!

Gin moves out of the way, but not fast enough for Mac.

<MAC>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get bloody well back! We only have four seconds for the concrete!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
He stays after as they set up again.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And where's the air bag? That's on five, or did you forget five comes after four?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
She bites her tongue.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The maze of red yarn at complete. Some fruit cartons have been stacked in the middle, atop which rests a Halloween mask indicating the real Mask. Attached to the yarn are small bells, the kind that go on cat collars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blindfolded, Gin tries to navigate through the yarn at Mac's direction. He will be able to see it, but she cannot.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, right arm to the left about six inches.

She moves her left arm, touches the yarn, the bell jingles.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your other right arm!

</GIN>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get it right first.

</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
She puts the blindfold back on, starts over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Under the planks again. Gin has the air bag in proper position this time.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And five--inflate!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>

Gin yanks a valve and a mylar bag inflates slowly--too slowly--beneath them.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then change the valve!

<DIRECTION>
She stares at him, fuming.

</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
They rotate off to the side.

It's evening. They're jogging around the grounds. He runs briskly ahead, turns and motions to her.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on! Come on!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
She jogs by him. For just an instant he takes a breath and guts it up. This is hard for him, but damned if he'll let her see that.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nighttime. They're around the table, with the remains of dinner, going over plans. Their heads are very close. She's got her hair up in a bun, held in place with a pencil.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls out the pencil to make a mark on the plans, and her hair falls down. She's concentrating, so she doesn't notice her hair brush past his cheek, the touch and the smell right in his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Early morning. They're back under the planks.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eight--deflate--
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
They wrestle the pneumatics in place--a ram powered by the slice pack.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And nine--move it, move it! --ten-- get the air! Okay, stop. Stop! Am I supposed to hammer this with my willy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
Gin's had enough of his hectoring.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't care what you do with your damn willy! Just don't worry about me! I'll be there!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just meant to say, if you can't do it in practice, you can't do it for real.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
He's calm, conciliatory, realizing he's pushed her too hard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The curtains are drawn in the hall. The fire burns. Dressed in a tight unitard, Gin moves through the maze of yarn. This time it's like tai chi. Half-cat, half-ballerina, she negotiates the maze with consummate skill and grace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see Mac watching her, knowing that blindfolded she can't see him. The way he watches is the pride of a mentor for his protege, but it's much more. For the first time we see how this amazing, maddening girl is getting under his skin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then she's at the Mask case. She rips off her blindfold, pure joy on her face.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I did it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<DIRECTION>
Mac opens the curtains. Light falls into the room.

<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In practice.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh come on sourpuss. Admit it. We're ready.

He produces a box. He gestures at her. Open it. As she opens it, as any man would he tries to protect himself.

<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's by some Italian. Supposed to be very trendy. I thought with your hair, the color--

There's a beautiful dress inside.

She holds it up to herself.

She loves it. Given how hard he's been on her through the training, she's genuinely touched.

</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
He turns to face her, hands her a glass, looking at her like a butterfly he is about to pin.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anything on your mind? Anything you need to tell me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
He seems to know everything. Really spooked now, she shakes her head.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come over her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
He leads her over to the battlements. Almost forces her to look over the edge. It's a long way down.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What would it be like to jump off? Would you burst like a melon on the rocks, or would you just fly away?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
Her hand shakes as she drinks from the glass.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't tell me you're scared--
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
She nods.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then how'd you do that Rembrandt?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had a lifeline.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	None now, though.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
She shakes her head, shivers again.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm cold.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<DIRECTION>
His face is dark.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never come up here without dropping something off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
She's right by the edge. He's behind her. Big, strong, menacing. He takes her champagne glass. She wonders: does he mean her?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He leans her over the battlement. There's a long beat. He tosses first one glass, then the other, over the side. We watch them break on the rocks below.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Supposed to be good luck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
And he gives her his best smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GIN'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Getting hold of herself, Gin checks her face in the mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GREAT HALL - NIGHT - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dressed in his tuxedo, Mac waits at the bottom of the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gin, we're four minutes late!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<GIN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm coming.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens at the top of the stairs and out she comes, wearing the dress. She looks truly beautiful. We watch him watch her come down the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do I look?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very beautiful--for a crook.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got something for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<DIRECTION>
She takes out a rose that looks suspiciously like one of the roses from the farmhouse.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So I'll recognize you. Wouldn't want to go home with the wrong man by mistake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<DIRECTION>
She pins it on his lapel, very close to him. He can smell her perfume, her hair. She steps back, examines him.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perfect.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles at him, not looking away. There are several ways to take that, most of which make him a bit self-conscious. Then he gives her a Masquerade mask.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a masked ball. We all go as someone else.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BLENHEIM PALACE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We swoop in on the Palace in all its magnificence. Rolls Royces and Limousines drive over the bridge and disgorge their guests at the tent by the entry. Over the gates is draped a banner proclaiming THE MASK Two Thousand Years of Chinese Art.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PALACE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Closer now. Guests getting out of cars. Gin and Mac sweep in with the rest of the crowd as security guards check names against a guest list. After their names are checked, the guests don their masks and enter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mac nods and exchanges small talk with other guests. A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN recognizes Mac.
</DIRECTION>
<BEAUTIFUL_WOMAN>

Lady Ashcroft gives Gin the full up-and-down.
</DIRECTION>
<BEAUTIFUL_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hmmm. Yes. Youth will be served.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEAUTIFUL_WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
She leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Business or pleasure?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Strictly pleasure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PALACE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A great hall. Musicians in the balcony. Mac and Gin stroll in. We see a huge CLOCK against the back wall, one of those mechanical wonders where dogs dressed like humans rotate around, banging on gongs to announce the hour. It says 9:45. Gin's fidgety.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Relax. You act like you're here to steal something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
She can't relax.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go get a drink. I'll look over the security guard check points, meet you back here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
She nods, walks away. He strolls into the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PALACE - ANOTHER CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mac examines a display of tin soldiers next to a security check-in box. Thibadeaux appears in a Chinese mandarin's outfit. He's agitated, worried about Gin catching them.
</DIRECTION>
<THIBADEAUX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you seen the setup in there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THIBADEAUX>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said a masked ball, not a costume party.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<THIBADEAUX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't tell me only the women were supposed to dress like Chinks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THIBADEAUX>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No ethnic slurs, please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<THIBADEAUX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The damn mask, man, it's made of cotton candy. What if you break it? What if she is selling you a pig in a poke?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THIBADEAUX>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if we drop it in the lake? It could melt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<THIBADEAUX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, you gotta call this off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THIBADEAUX>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Patience Thib, patience. Trust me.

</MAC>
<THIBADEAUX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Remind me why.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THIBADEAUX>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because it pays off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<THIBADEAUX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not your damn ass on the line.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THIBADEAUX>
<DIRECTION>
Thibadeaux spots Gin coming up, disappears into the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
<DIRECTION>
(to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, but it is.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Gin)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Haven't I seen him before?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean Charlie Chan? He was looking for number two son.

	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Before your time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
The music changes to something very danceable.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We could dance, if you knew how.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
She stares at him.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Try me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PALACE - GREAT HALL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The music begins. Mac reaches out his hand to Gin. She's had to overcome a lot to get here. Her fear, the incredible pressure of the job, his impossible behavior. But here she is, Cinderella at the Ball.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches out her hand to take his. And as she takes it time stops. For the first time they are truly touching, truly connected. They stare at each other. And then they take the floor, tentative at first like new lovers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes her in his arms and then, expecting nothing, he leads her into one combination, then another. She follows him effortlessly, her eyes never leaving his face, as if to say, is that all you've got?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes her into more complicated moves, but she's right there, in his arms, not missing a beat. Anyone looking would believe they were completely in love.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where did you learn to do this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles, teasing him.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My father.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course. Dear...old...dad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
We are absorbed in their absorption with each other. It's as if the force between them clears a space around them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then we see Thibadeaux watching them, watching intently, gauging just how close these two seem to have become. And he doesn't like it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The other dancers disappear into a swirl of color and movement. We only see them now, and it's hot and beautiful.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They see only each other. Suddenly the clock strikes 10. The little figures swing out and begin pounding the chimes. Dong. Dong. Dong. The reminder of time, of their job, makes her stumble.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	About to turn into a pumpkin, princess?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
As the chimes continue, they stare at each other, the spell not quite broken. Neither expected this surge of feeling. Neither knows what to say. Mac offers her his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It would be rude to leave without paying a visit to the guest of honor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
Meaning--the Mask. She nods and takes his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PALACE - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are strolling down a long hall with other couples going to see the Mask. The Gallery is just ahead, around that corner there's a security guard's clock and there's...oh no! Greeting them is a pair of GLASS DOORS.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are the damn steel doors?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Replaced obviously. Armored smart glass at a guess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
In front of them, on a special pedestal, covered with a dome of clear glass, is the MASK. The first time we have seen it for real. It is right there, so close. But Glass Doors! Panicked, Gin hisses at Mac under her breath.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can't do this in a fishbowl!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's off!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's on. Something always goes wrong. At least we know going in what it is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
As he talks, he kneels down to check his show, quickly peeling off a tiny silver disc with tape backing and leaving it in the center of a square of marble.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Besides, you're good. You told me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now smile.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
And she does as they walk out through the very clear glass doors, the Mask gleaming in its case behind them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PALACE LAKE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CRANE DOWN from bridge as a car exits the now-quiet Palace and crosses to reveal a SMALL BLACK ZODIAC in which we find Mac and Gin, dressed in dark silver mylar thermal suits, diving bags carrying all their gear. They both have lights mounted on head bands.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ready?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<GIN>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ready.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<DIRECTION>
Mac pulls on his face mask, slides backwards into the black water. Gin follows behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PALACE LAKE - UNDER WATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mac swims through the murky water. Once he gets under the bridge he switches on his head lamp. Up ahead, in the dim light, we see a window covered with rusted bars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mac pulls out his slice pack, turns on the valve, and begins to burn the bars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LAKE - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They swim through the now-cut gate, toward us, shining their light through the dark dirty water. They enter a narrow tube, their feet disappear and then the light dims into blackness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They emerge from the water. Gin leads as they belly crawl up a dank tunnel that narrows as they go. This is creepy, scary hard. We hear their breathing. Gin's headlight picks out a reddish glint. Holy shit. A rat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's overcome with claustrophobic panic! Her mouth goes dry at cotton. Her breath comes in gasps. She can't move. She can barely get the words out.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's a rat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's a bigger bloody rat behind you! Get your ass in gear!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
She takes a breath, begins to crawl again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PALACE - TUNNEL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They reach a rusted steel door. Mac pushes it in. An old shelving unit on the other side falls to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CASTLE BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They make their way through the maze of a class foundation-- hand-laid brick piers supporting thick cut beams, over which has been laid a wood sub-floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GREAT HALL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The party-goers are leaving. The clock hands jerk closer to midnight. It's 11:58.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CASTLE BASEMENT/INT. PALACE/INT. MASK ROOM - INTERCUT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They reach a chamber where all the piers and beams are reinforced steel, the floor solid concrete. We are beneath the Imperial Gallery.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They move urgently now. Mac takes out a receiver, homes in on the signal from the mini-transmitter he taped to the floor. He measures out a certain distance one way as she measures the other. He carefully marks the square on the concrete, eighteen inches on a side. As they work Gin pops some bubble gum into her mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Less than a minute.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
Gin hands Mac the blade det cord. Mac quickly squeezes it onto the concrete. Gin sets up the decibel meter.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Five, four, three, two, one...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<DIRECTION>
DONG! goes the big clock chime and BOOM! in perfect synch goes the first explosion.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And two--
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
DONG! Boom. We now see what they've been practicing.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And three--
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
DONG. Boom.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And four--
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
DONG. Boom.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And five--Inflate!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
DONG. As they jump back, Gin pops the valve on the mylar air bag. They stick levers into two of the holes. DONG.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And six--
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
They pry the two sides. DONG.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And seven--
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
CRACK the concrete square falls onto the inflated air bag, revealing the marble square of the floor. DONG.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And deflate!--Eight--
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
They move the ram into position. DONG.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nine--air!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
Gin works the valve. BAM! The ram strikes against the marble. DONG.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The decibel meter jumps, coming perilously close to a read line drawn on it.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ten--More air!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
In the Mask Room we see the slightest bit of dust rise from one of the marble squares on the floor. DONG.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's too loud!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<MAC>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eleven--More!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
Gin turns the valve even more, her eye on the decibel meter. Mac carefully shifts the ram striking point.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And twelve.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
DONG. Bam. The ram hits the last time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the Mask Room, one of the marble squares floats slightly above the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A GUARD walks through the Great Hall. He enters a card into a check-in box, which beeps quietly. Then he continues his rounds through the debris of the party.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mac has his hands on the marble.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rollers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
She hands him black pipes which he places under the marble.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gently, very gently.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
They lower the marble onto the rollers, then roll it away. The basement is bathed in the dim light of the Mask room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mac carefully extends the 20 centimeter rod. They know they can't go above that.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mac positions the camera, which comes oh so close to the top of the rod. He opens a palm top computer with a mouse that lets him control the camera, tests it, surveys the room on his screen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He positions the tripod with its laser magic arms, carefully sets it. She mounts the first light. They are head to head, extremely close, in the narrow opening.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Contact.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<DIRECTION>
She turns on the laser. On Mac's screen we see a red beam stream out directly into the PIR sensor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The guard has made his way closer to the Mask room. He inserts his card into the next checkpoint.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the Great Hall, the hands of the clock move to 12:02.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mac positions the next tripod through the small opening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On Mac's palm top monitor we now see a maze of red lights exactly like the yarn on his floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mac turns to Gin. It either works now or it doesn't. They share a long look, then she crawls up through the narrow opening, into the room. He looks at his watch.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Less than four minutes now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment she lies on the floor, still, the Mask looming over her on the other side of the room. We hear her breathing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he talks her through, MOS, she begins the delicate tai chi around the beams which only Mac can see. If she breaks one, she sets off the alarm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are on her face, then his. The concentration is intense. He is dancing through the beams using her body. It is as intimate, if not more so, as their dance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Guard checks in at another checkpoint. The clock says 12:04.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally she makes it to the Mask, pulls out a tiny palm top, scans a series of numbers, then enters them into the keypad.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Very slowly the canopy above the Mask begins to rise.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watch the pressure switch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
She has a knife in one hand, ready to slide it carefully under the Mask. But her hand begins to shake. Pulls back. Tries again. Damn! Worse!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mac doesn't bully her now. He talks softly and confidently, mentor to protege, professional to professional.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We all get the shakes. Deep breath now. In through the nose. Out through the mouth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
She tries, but her hand still shakes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Guard enters the room before the corridor leading to the Mask Room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Great Hall Clock says 12:05.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mac glances at his watch.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, think of a beach, palm trees swaying in the wind, the gentle sound of the surf. Think of nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
She closes her eyes, tries to imagine.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or a great big rat, about to take a bite out of your ass.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
She opens her eyes, grinning and determined. She sticks her hand with the knife toward the base of the Mask again. It shakes, but she steadies it, slips it under the Mask! Ahhh.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good girl. No hurry, but the guard's coming down the corridor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
The Guard turns into the corridor leading to the glass doors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gin carefully lifts the Mask, holding the knife under it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Guard approaches the Mask Room. We see the double doors, but not the Mask case. He stops and takes a sip of champagne from a half-empty glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gin slowly slides the Mask over to the edge of its pedestal and into her bag while holding the knife down.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Preparing pressure switch neutralization device.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<DIRECTION>
The we have a wonderful low-tech moment. She takes the BUBBLE GUM out of her mouth, sticks it on the Mask mount, then lifts her hand away. Success.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just speed it up a bit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
The big clock says 12:07.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Guard idly glances into the Mask Room. He does a double take. What the bloody hell?!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a mask there, but it's Gin's party mask. The real Mask is gone.

Splash! Mac bursts through the surface of the lake! He climbs into the Zodiac, slips off his mask. Splash! Woof! Gin comes up, gasping, thrilled.

She undoes it from around her neck, lifts it up to him. She reaches up her hand, expecting him to help her in. He doesn't. He stares at her, dark, baleful.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now's when you tell me who you really are.

He grabs her by the hair, then shoves her under! She comes up gasping.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You work for Hector Cruz at Webber Insurance. You're a bloody cop.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
She treads water, tries to talk through her sputtering and choking. WHOOP! WHOOP! WHOOP! An alarm goes off in the Palace. Lights pop on all around the building. In the b.g. we see people running toward the Palace.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<DIRECTION>
He shoves her under again! Lifts her back out! She's gasping for breath, terrified, desperate.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The insurance job, it was cover. That's how I got the code!
	</DIALOGUE>

The boat has drifted out into the light. Police cars race over the bridge right above them. Mac pays them no attention.

<GIN>

	For God sake, the cops...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>

He stares at her. Impenetrable and menacing.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you're playing both sides of the street. Keep the Mask, turn me in.

</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
Down under the dark water again! Then up!

<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please! I'm a thief! Like you!

Mac thinks for a moment.

<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes! Yes!

</GIN>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do I need a thief for? I've got the Mask.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
He shoves her under again! For a long time! When she comes up this time she's terrified now.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The big job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is no big job.

</MAC>

He starts to shove her under again. This is very scary.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a billion!

<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A billion what?

</MAC>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dollars.

He's about to dunk her again, for the final terrible time.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's just your share.

Mac stares at her for a long beat.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please. Trust me.

</GIN>

What is he going to do? We don't know. His face is hard, gives us nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get the hell in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls her unceremoniously into the boat. She lies gasping on the floor like a fish, rolls over and faces the night sky. WHAAOOO!! WHAAOO!! More police cars race across the bridge, their sirens screaming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Totally unflappable and always unpredictable, Mac reaches down into the boat and pulls out a bottle.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whiskey?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>

Gin can barely get her breath. A moment ago he was about to drown her.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No...thank you.

Mac savors his. The sirens increase!! More police cars!!

He paddles the boat out of frame and the dark lake DISSOLVES TO:

EXT. KUALA LUMPUR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The prow of a boat enters the frame. Gin and Mac are in a small river craft on a narrow brown stream overhung with palm trees and tropical vegetation. As the boat docks, the two of them continue a discussion they have obviously been having for quite some time.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on. You mean a billion isn't enough?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>

Beyond them is an extraordinary sight: supermodern buildings, set against deep green tropical mountains: the architectural design laboratory that is Kuala Lumpur, city of the third millennium.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Amazing, isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<DIRECTION>
Gin is putting Mac off a little, having her fun now.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Extraordinary.

He's not even looking. He wants his answer.

The taxi makes its way through open air markets shoe-horned between sleek white towers.

	I'm getting less than fifteen percent!

EXT. KUALA LUMPUR - CROWDED DISTRICT - DAY

The taxi stops. Gin and Mac get out. Gin pays the driver. They walk toward the unmarked door of an unmarked warehouse.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To be fair, it's your plan, you should get at least 30 per cent--

Gin flips down a metal cover on the warehouse wall, revealing a control panel into which she enters a code.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens, revealing circular stairs. Gin heads up.

On Mac's face we see grudging respect.

INT. GIN'S LOFT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The stairs lead us into a huge loft, hardwood floors stretching to shuttered windows. Not a single personal item anywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's....homey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
Gin unpacks the Mask, opens a closet along the wall, pulls back a row of men's clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Finally, a personal detail. Boyfriend?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I don't carry baggage.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<DIRECTION>
The echo with his line is deliberate. She's dialing in the safe combination, she's constantly moving.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Smart girl.

He examines some men's work overalls and a tuxedo.

	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That is your size, isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>

She puts the Mask into the safe, then closes it back up.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So we're here. What's the job?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
She goes to the windows, throws open the shutters. Framed in the windows is a matched pair of ivory towers that seem to rise into the heavens. Connecting them is an airy sky bridge of glass and metal. It's a truly incredible sight.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Petronas Towers. World's tallest building.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're going to steal it? Interesting.

She holds out her hand.

	I need the Rembrandt.

</GIN>
<DIRECTION>
Mac produces the tube with the painting.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
She hands him a stack of photographs, notebooks, maps.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some homework for you. There's food in the fridge. Briefing at six. Don't be late.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<DIRECTION>
She leaves. We stay on Mac's face. Okay, I'll play along for a while.

EXT. KUALA LUMPUR - DAY

In long shot we see Gin arrive at the headquarters of CONRAD GREENE, ex-CIA Asia hand, now the expatriate head of a business of questionable legality.

INT. GREENE'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

<DIRECTION>
A POCKMARKED YOUTH escorts Gin into Greene's office. Greene is mopping his face with a scarf.
</DIRECTION>
<GREENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The damn heat. Rots the flesh. Rots the soul. It's a shame colder countries do such good police work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREENE>

He holds out his hand to Gin, who takes it.

She hands him the mailing tube.

He takes it out, stares at it.

	A true masterpiece.

He hands her an identical mailing tube.

(re: the painting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So who's getting that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<GREENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm thinking my old CIA friends will peddle it to Russia for a little plutonium. The plutonium to an unmentionable Middle Eastern Country--in return for embargoed oil on tankers for delivery to me. Elegant, no?

</GIN>
<GREENE>

</GREENE>
<DIRECTION>
She stands up, her business over. But there's a reptilian evil behind Greene's oily demeanor.
</DIRECTION>
<GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh Gin, if you don't come through. We'll be making a--shall we say--more up-to- date death mask. Do I make myself clear?

His unctuous smile.

INT. GIN'S PLACE - MAGIC HOUR

Gin returns, carrying the metal canister. The place has that empty feel.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mac?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<DIRECTION>
No Mac. She paces for a moment, doesn't want to think what she's thinking, can't avoid it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She walks to the closet. The safe's slightly open.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please Jesus no.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<DIRECTION>
She opens the safe. EMPTY. Except for a note: IOU 1 MASK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stabs at her message machine. No messages. She bangs the machine! Damn!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She dials Mac's number.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not in. You can leave a message but I won't call back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
She throws the phone down!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She rips through the clothes, throwing them onto the floor! She throws out everything in the cabinets! Empties the drawers!
</DIRECTION>

No Mask. Nowhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Devastated, she slumps to the floor. This is as bad as it gets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MALAKA MARKET - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On piers by the brown water we see locals gobbling their meals. At a narrow table we find Mac, chopsticks in hand, mouth full. On his plate is a whole fish. Thibadeaux sits down beside him, looks at the bowling ball bag.

<THIBADEAUX>

Thibadeaux is not one to appreciate art.

	It's not just art. Dear boy. It's history. Something you Americans don't care about--because you haven't got any.

<THIBADEAUX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's because we live in the future. Dear boy. Which is what's on my mind.

He spreads out the photographs of Gin and Greene.

Mac picks up the photographs, looks at Gin's image.

	She's not my girlfriend.

Thibadeaux studies his face, not quite buying it.

<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a bank job that's all I know. You've got to have faith Thibs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<THIBADEAUX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Faith is angels dancing on the head of a pin. I've got to have trust. You wouldn't be thinking of changing partners, would you? You change partners, you change the rules.

Mac examines the Mask.

<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A touch of immortality.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, honey, I'm home.

BAM! Someone coldcocks him! Stunned, he falls to his knees. Looks up woozily. Standing over him is--Gin. Furious.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You bastard!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<DIRECTION>
Then she swings at him again. This woman doesn't fight like a girl. BAM! Really connects this time. He goes down like a sack of potatoes and the momentum of her swing carries her down onto the floor with him!
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>

</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's in the bag, the Mask is in the bag.
	</DIALOGUE>

She catches her breath. He lets her up, she sees the bag.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God, I thought--
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<DIRECTION>
She's embarrassed and relieved. But what really upset her is not only losing the Mask but losing him and that realization comes in a long moment of silence.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you'd gone.

As she pushes him away, the tears come.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey...hey...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to hold her, she pushes him away, then all the hurt and anger goes out of her and she lets him hold her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Their faces are so close, hers streaked with tears. And it's her who kisses him first.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He holds back for a moment but only for a moment and then he kisses her and then all the emotion they've held in flows out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then, breathing hard, she pulls back.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got to know something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<DIRECTION>
He stares at her.

She nods. Yes, that's it.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Absolutely.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
And he says it so simply and so honestly that she begins to smile.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. I'd have done the same thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Any more questions?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
She gently closes his nostrils with her fingers.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now I'm going to drown you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<DIRECTION>
She kisses him, covering his mouth over and over, so he can't breathe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And that goes from playful to for real. Her hand goes under his shirt, his under her blouse. Legs intertwine, breathing gets heavy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see skin and then more skin and two bodies becoming one.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GIN'S APARTMENT - NEXT MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Splash! Water goes on Mac's face. For a long moment he looks at himself in the mirror. He's broken all his rules.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GIN'S APARTMENT - KUALA LUMPUR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mac walks back into the apartment. Gin lies naked in the bed, her back to him. He sits down on the bed. Stares at the curve of her body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches out and traces the line of her back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We go to Gin, who we think is still asleep. But her eyes are open and filled with emotion. The night together has been as powerful and confusing for her as it was for him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She rolls over and into Mac's arms. For a moment they hold each other, no irony, no distance.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you ever wish--you could trade all your secrets--straight up, with someone? Just once?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
She doesn't know how to respond, so tries to find some solid ground by trying to treat her deep feelings with a light touch.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What would that make us, in love or something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<DIRECTION>
And then it's his turn to retreat.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment their eyes meet, but the emotions have gotten ahead of the words. There's an emotional nakedness that needs a fig leaf. And when the words come they seem simple and honest and without guile.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We broke the rules, didn't we?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>

Mac pores over the plans. We see diagrams of elevator shafts, security systems, air-conditioning ducts. Wiring schematics.

It's getting dark. Mac has covered the plans with neat drawings and bold magic marker lines and key words. We see arrows running from one section to another, times in parentheses.

Gin comes by, looks over his shoulder, gently touches him, but he keeps marking the plans. As he works he talks to himself and runs a stopwatch. His movements are graceful, like a sculptor's.

Mac's on a parapet. He takes the Microwave Dish out of his bag and positions it beneath a cranny by the air conditioning equipment. He aims it at the tower across the way. Sets a timing device.

Twin banks of elevators. Stainless steel and marble in Islamic geometry. Gin approaches and leans nonchalantly against the door of the elevator next to the service door. She's got something behind her back. A group of party-goers get into a nearby lift and invite Gin in. She waves them on. She checks her watch. 11:42.

"Closed for Maintenance" reads the sign that Mac places in front of the service elevator. He walks in, the steel door closes behind him.

INT. SHAFT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mac climbs out of the elevator hatch. Punches a number into the keypad of the remote. The elevator moves upwards to the first floor. Through the wire mesh panels lining the shaft of the counterweight Mac can now see the roof of Gin's elevator. Using the remote control he inches his elevator up until the two elevator roofs are level. Mac speaks into his headset.

Gin listens to the voice in her earpiece. Another group of partygoers approach her elevator. She stands away from the door revealing...an "out of service" sign. She shrugs sympathetically as the party folk choose another lift. We also see what they don't. A small key has been inserted into the lift call panel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIFT SHAFT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A compact power-wrench whirs. Mac removes the last of the bolts holding a mesh screen panel. With difficulty he climbs through the small opening into the shaft that carries the counterweight. The basement is a hundred feet below, the counterweight a thousand feet above him. Straddling the narrow shaft he begins to unscrew the bolts holding the screen that separates him from the roof of Gin's elevator.

A quick look around and Gin turns and removes her key. The doors open and she steps into the elevator she's been guarding. Mindful of the security camera above her she furtively pulls out the STOP button. Presses "doors close". The polished doors slide shut...almost shut...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THWANG!! A foot is thrust through the closing gap, closely followed by the flushed face of the DRUNKEN GUEST who accosted her earlier.

Before Gin has time to protest he turns to the control panel, pushes back the stop button and punches 75!! Unable to prevent herself Gin blurts out

<DIRECTION>
INT. SHAFT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mac is halfway through the opening. Alerted by Gin's warning and by the whine of the machinery he desperately scrambles back to avoid having his head literally torn off by the upcoming elevator. As he pulls himself through, the elevator catches his hand. Rips the wrench away from him. It tumbles into the darkness below. In the narrow coffin-wide counterweight shaft Mac now fights to prevent himself sliding after his wrench. Desperately he hooks his fingers into the mesh. His fingers tear at the openings...and hold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

Barely able to breathe, Gin stares at the Drunken Guest as he lurches towards her.

<DIRECTION>
INT. SHAFT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mac is in deep trouble. Five hundred feet above him and now hurtling downwards are thirty tons of concrete counterweight. Six feet above him is the opening he must now reach - or he's road-kill. He struggles painfully to the opening, look sup. The counterweight is two hundred feet above him and falling like a guillotine. No wrench. No time to get himself through the narrow opening he grasps the ledge above. Swings back and kicks frantically at the mesh screen below. With the downdraft of the weight roaring in his ears, Mac kicks again and again until the screen buckles and falls. Mac lands on the service elevator roof as the weight sweeps down behind him, crushing the protruding screen with sickening ease.

Misunderstanding the smile and the apparent question the Drunken Guest leans into Gin pinning her back against the side wall.

In mid-flight about the sparks that are going to fly between them the Drunken Guest's face suddenly undergoes a strange change. An alcohol-anesthetized body suddenly perceiving...pain. Unseen by the video camera Gin literally has him by the balls. Never letting the camera smile leave her face she talks firmly and evenly to him.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And now the counterweight just visible, sweeping upwards from the darkness below. Without hesitation Mac reaches forward, grabs the vibrating cable and using his gloved hands as a brake, slides down the cable to meet the on-coming weight. Mac has to slow down if he's not going to meet the weight at free-fall velocity. Smoke seeps from his gloves as the friction bites. His face contorts with the effort but his feet hit the weight and suddenly he's being swept upward at the frightening speed.

At this level, there's no mesh screen between the counterweight and main elevator shaft - only a series of horizontal bracing girders. They flash past Mac's face as he looks up. The elevator is now coming down towards him like Dorothy's house in the tornado.

Mac stands poised to jump as the weight slows. The elevator draws level but a girder blocks the way! To make the jump he must wait for a precious second as the gap between him and the elevator roof starts to widen. And now he's clear. He launches himself into the growing void.

Mac grabs the wrench from his pack, jams it under the visor! The servo motor grinds, the wrench vibrates but holds! Mac jabs his hand in, grabs out the disc!

In the surveillance room, pandemonium. Lights are flashing!

<DIRECTION>
SWAT Teams charge into the building as a huge party goes on outside. Fireworks, revellers, celebration.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mac and Gin ride down the elevator as he takes off his overalls to reveal his tuxedo underneath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cruz scans the elevator display.

<CRUZ>

The elevator bumps to a stop on floor 50. The lights inside go out.

</CRUZ>
<DIRECTION>
Mac and Gin pry open the top of the elevator. Climb out, begin prying open the doors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mac and Gin run down a hallway, into an empty office. There's a deep, pulsating, vibrating sound. Whop-whop.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Blackhawk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
And just then the HELICOPTER rises into frame, right outside the window. BLAM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An RPG with a tear gas warhead crashes through the window!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room fills with gas! They begin to cough and wheeze!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gas masks on, SWAT Teams run up the stairs!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gin and Mac head for the stairs! Can't go that way!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cruz watches on the monitors.
</DIRECTION>
<CRUZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rats in a trap.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRUZ>
<DIRECTION>
Coughing and wheezing, Mac leads Gin right back into the tear gas! By the entry hole of the RPG there's a draft of fresh air. Mac picks up a chair, bangs it on the hole, breaks out more glass! Through the hole we see the cable of lights stretching across to the Sky Bridge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Outside the building, fireworks continue. The helicopter hovers on the outside of the tower. But there, wait a minute! The lights strung between the buildings seem to be moving. We go closer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gin and Mac are going hand over hand! Across the lights, heading for the struts of the Sky Bridge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We're close on them now. Hands on the wire. Faces concentrating. This is too hard! Fireworks burst above them!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Far down below we see crowds celebrating.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then the cable sags a little! It's not made for their weight. The support starts to give way!
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go! Go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
They're close to the strut, they try to speed up, but the cable sags again!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The support pulls out of its mooring! The cable pulls free! They swing out, toward the strut, almost smash into it! Then swing back, pendulum out again, head straight for the strut! And Mac grabs it! Wraps his leg around it! Pulls Gin in!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Safe! But then the wire swings back, spurting angry sparks from its torn end! It's live!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mac makes two quick turns of his climbing rope, clips on a carabiner, and climbs back down to Gin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wire swings wide, then heads back.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hang on!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs Gin, then kicks away from the highly conductive steel strut, just as--right where they were--the wire hits it in an angry shower of sparks!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mac and Gin swing wide on the rope, high above the ground. Her bag rips off her shoulder and arcs high into the air and then disappears on the way to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shiiittt!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<DIRECTION>
Mac swings back, grabs at the strut, can't hold, spins, kicks hard at it with his foot, swings back again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gin is barely hanging on. She can't do another swing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mac grabs desperately onto the handhold, swings a leg around, and she grabs on as well. Safe. Sort of.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mac and Gin are dwarfed by the struts. Behind them is the black sky laced with fireworks and the stark geometric design of the building. Far below them the celebration on the street continues. The people look like ants.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Swat team members run across the lower level of the Sky Bridge. Just beneath them, on the struts, are Gin and Mac. They enter a trap door, climb up an interior ladder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They emerge on the lower level. The SWAT teams are above them now, on the second level. Mac and Gin climb out to the roof, all the while just avoiding being seen by the SWAT teams running back and forth!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They're on the roof! Sixty floors above the street! mac points to the big air conditioning ducts.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We need to get there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly they begin negotiating the web of steel girders, heading for the opposite tower.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, FLASH! The helicopter searchlight catches them.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUDSPEAKER>
	<DIALOGUE>

Gin stops in the lights, like a deer.

Mac grabs her arm.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you can't have fun now, you never will!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
He steers her, on the run, across the glass roof of the Sky Bridge, hundreds of feet above the ground, caught in the lights of the hovering helicopter!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cruz watches from the monitoring room.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUDSPEAKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Police! Stop where you are!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUDSPEAKER>
<DIRECTION>
Still fixed in the searchlights, Gin and Mac run over the steep frame, closing in on the other tower!

The other building is only a few feet away!

Cruz has a big choice to make. Everyone stares at him.
</DIRECTION>
<POLICE_OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're losing them! My team leader has a clear shot! I'm authorizing him to take it.

The pressure on Cruz is unbelievable. He takes off his headset, like Pilate washing his hands of responsibility.
</DIRECTION>
<CRUZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your country. Your call.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRUZ>
<DIRECTION>
Gin and Mac leap into the building just as BLAM! BLAM! Bullets shatter the glass right by them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gin is terrified. Mac's whole demeanor changes. This is for keeps now. He slams a steel door to the Sky Bridge, shutting the SWAT teams out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They race through the corridors of the building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Doubling back, out again to where the huge stainless steel air-conditioning shafts vent into the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They run to the giant intakes. It's too high for her! Mac Makes a cup of his hands, boosts her up! But the helicopter's back! The wind from its rotors almost blow them over. Gin reaches her hand out to help Mac up. BLAM! He's hit in the side, spun around!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With superhuman strength, she jerks him up into the funnel, out of the line of fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He lies on the floor of the funnel, bleeding.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<DIRECTION>
Right behind them the shaft makes a right angle turn and plunges to the street. Above them a huge fan gently turns, fracturing the searchlight from the helicopter. In the b.g. we see the SWAT teams burst out onto the roof!
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get to the edge.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
Mac struggles up, they go to the edge of the black abyss. The wind whistles up in their faces. He hands her a pack.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Plan B.

You're dead. She can't finish the thought. There are tears in her eyes.

He pushes her over the edge!
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pull the cord!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
We hear her scream. And then, inside the shaft, we see the chute pop open!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mac turns, framed in the stainless steel tube, and faces the SWAT team, weapons drawn.

	Gentlemen, I know you've heard this before, but you're making a terrible mistake.

EXT. PETRONAS TOWERS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gin emerges on the ground and blends into the crowd spilling out into the street. She looks up at the two giant towers etches against the sky, fireworks still blossoming all around them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
High on the building, helicopters hover like malevolent insects by the air conditioning shaft.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Gin walks, we stay on her face. Gradually the music and the fireworks fade away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. KUALA LUMPUR - EARLY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A ghost town. Empty wet streets strewn with the debris of celebration. The only person on the street is a Chinese street cleaner, who wears a rice hat and a green plastic garbage bag for a raincoat against the gentle drizzle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RAILROAD STATION - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The station clock ticks to 6:35. The station is completely deserted except for Gin, who is sitting on a platform seat watching the clock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No Mac. Gin's eyes fill with tears. We know what it means if he's late. But she is determined to give him a few more minutes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's 6:40.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's scuffing on the pavement behind her. She turns. It's Mac! She leaps up, joyful, runs to him. He's walking stiffly toward her. She throws her arms around him, covers him with kisses.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're late! You're never late!

<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My god! My god! I thought you were--
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<DIRECTION>
She's half-laughing, half-crying. The camera moves around. We see Mac's face. it's stone cold. He gently disengages her arms. Touches the tear on her cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Virginia Baker, you're under arrest for grand larceny. Anything you say may be taken down in evidence--
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
She starts to laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mac!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--and used against you in a court of law.

She looks beyond him, then looks over his shoulder and sees some COPS moving into position on the platform.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>

	No. NO.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I tried telling you, be prepared for surprises.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
She sags, unable to stand, the wind knocked out of her. On the opposite platform a train rumbles in. And then we see Thibadeaux emerge from among the gathered cops.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The man from Blenheim Palace.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Special Agent Aaron Thibadeaux. The cop I work for every now and then. Catching thieves--the really good ones. Like you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
And then Gin sees another man emerge next to Thibadeaux. CRUZ. Gin stares at Cruz, starting to lose it.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They've been onto you for a while.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You gave them back our money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I gave them Greene, the Rembrandt, the Mask, and the full seven billion.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seven?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<DIRECTION>
What does Mac mean? Did he take the other billion? Did he leave it for her?
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll just have to make do with one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
A train rattles into the station. The cops are ready to move. Frantic, Gin looks around: nowhere to run!
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry. They won't move until I tell them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
He turns slightly, shielding her from Thibadeaux's view. Talks under his breath.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In my pocket is a packet. Get it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
Confused, she does.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Passport, visa, ticket on the Eastern end Orient Express to Bangkok. From there-- anywhere.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Gin tries to process this, does this mean what she thinks is does?
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Even the surprises have a surprise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
She studies his face.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two tickets?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
True sentiment is hard for him. But he does it. He gives her his best gift--her freedom.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everything you wanted--you'll have it. Be that swallow. Fly away, Kid. Just fly away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
She is overcome, wants to thank him, to argue, to keep him by her side a minute longer. But there's danger all around and Mac has a very clear agenda.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd) (beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now reach into my other pocket--
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
Cruz and Thibadeaux watch as Mac talks to Gin, partly shielding her from their view. Cruz doesn't like this.
</DIRECTION>
<CRUZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is he doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRUZ>
<DIRECTION>
Thibadeaux puts his hand out to restrain Cruz. He's clearly in charge.
</DIRECTION>
<THIBADEAUX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We do it Mac's way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THIBADEAUX>
<DIRECTION>
The subway train cars open with a whoosh. Gin rips a gun out of Mac's pocket! Points it at his head.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You move, I'll blow his head off!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIN>
<DIRECTION>
The cops on the platform freeze. Mac slowly raises his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gin backs toward the open doors of the subway cars. Cruz pulls out his pistol, aims it right at them.
</DIRECTION>
<CRUZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put down the gun!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRUZ>
<DIRECTION>
Thibadeaux reaches up and pulls Cruz's gun down.
</DIRECTION>
<THIBADEAUX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You put down the gun, asshole.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THIBADEAUX>
<DIRECTION>
The doors start to close. Gin gives Mac a shove and leaps in, just as the doors slam shut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cops run toward the car. Cruz races up, banging on the car doors! But the train pulls away.
</DIRECTION>
<CRUZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goddammitt!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRUZ>
<DIRECTION>
Mac sags to the bench. Cruz barks into his walkie-talkie.
</DIRECTION>
<THIBADEAUX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THIBADEAUX>
<DIRECTION>
Mac nods. Cruz turns to Mac, eyes narrowed and suspicious.
</DIRECTION>
<CRUZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know you, MacDougal. I don't know what it is, but you've done something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRUZ>
<MAC>

	I've done your job for you. And you got me shot.

</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
Cruz's walkie-talkie buzzes. He barks into it.
</DIRECTION>
<CRUZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Block the whole damn station off! I'll be right there!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Mac)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This isn't over.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRUZ>
<DIRECTION>
He runs toward the steps. Thibadeaux sits wearily down beside Mac.
</DIRECTION>
<THIBADEAUX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He won't quit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THIBADEAUX>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bless him for that.

</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
Thibadeaux stares at his old friend.
</DIRECTION>
<THIBADEAUX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What kind of cop are you? Letting that girl get away?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THIBADEAUX>
<DIRECTION>
He means that in more ways than one.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thibs--
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
So much to say, so few words for it. He shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Someone else will have to catch her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
Thibadeaux chooses his words carefully.
</DIRECTION>
<THIBADEAUX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It doesn't happen often, maybe never, but you nab the right one...You just hold on tight with all you've fucking got. And then you thank the good Lord for every minute you have.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THIBADEAUX>
<DIRECTION>
Their eyes meet for a long beat.
</DIRECTION>
<THIBADEAUX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What you said about the Mask. You said, art was what matters because it lasts. I thought about that--a lot. And you know something? It's bullshit. People don't last. That's why they matter more than anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THIBADEAUX>
<DIRECTION>
They think about that, about Tina, about Gin.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyway. She's gone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<THIBADEAUX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're no good to me like this. Take a long vacation. Hell, forget that. I'm firing your ass.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THIBADEAUX>
<DIRECTION>
Mac stares at Thibadeaux, who is doing for Mac what mac did for Gin. he is setting him free.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't I get a pension?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<THIBADEAUX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit.

</THIBADEAUX>
<DIRECTION>
He grins. It's a parting moment.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<THIBADEAUX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I damn sure better not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THIBADEAUX>
<DIRECTION>
And he walks away, leaving Mac sitting on the bench. We move across the platform, watching Mac sit there. Another train comes in. People get off. People get on. Very slowly he checks his watch. We track into Mac's eye, dissolve from the image of the train in it to--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRANS-CHINA EXPRESS - Dusk - Mac's vision
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another train, a passenger train. Gin is sitting by the window, staring out at the sunset. She's dressed differently, her hair is different. Thailand passes by outside, but she really doesn't see it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She leafs through the packet Mac gave her. Tickets, passports, and--a pressed red rose, the one she gave him at Blenheim. She picks it up, tries to smell its faint memory. We take a long beat of wistfulness at what might have been.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RAILROAD STATION - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The clatter of a train pulling in brings Mac out of his reverie. People stream off. His very bones feel weary now. He loved her. He set her free. He's alone again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The train departs, leaving the tracks empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And there, standing alone on the other platform, is Gin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mac sees her. Very slowly he stands up, his eyes never leave her face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She came back. For him. They both begin to smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hold on them there, staring at each other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEGIN END CREDITS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RAILWAY STATION - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are square on the space between the tracks. In the b.g. the rails emerge out of a tunnel into the bright sunlight. Mac and Gin come together into frame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They kiss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then we are behind them as they walk toward the light.
</DIRECTION>
<GIN>

<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT:

THE END
