:SC: YOUTH IN REVOLT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OVER BLACK comes the sound of deep HEAVING BREATHS. Moist FLESH FLAPPING accompaniment. Someone is beating off. A pause as the someone turns the page of a magazine. The beating off resumes at a quickened pace. The SQUEAKING of bed springs joins in. Another page is turned. Feverish THUMPING until a MALE VOICE lets out a quiet MOAN. The breathing gradually slows to normal and lets out a relieved sigh of finality.

<DIRECTION>
INT. NICK'S ROOM - DAY

	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
We PAN DOWN, and where Nick's crotch is supposed to be, there is a hole in the screen leading us to...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LAS VEGAS OF THE BODY The pulsing neon sign outside the club reads: NICK'S PENIS. We fly inside where we find a star-studded floor show. Drunken CONVENTIONEERS make out with STRIPPERS. A LEOPARD leaps through a burning HOOP on stage.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mom's boyfriend, Jerry is a long distance trucker, though his ultimate ambition is to be on state disability.

Jerry absently smacks Estelle's butt. Waddles over to the breakfast table. He snatches the Funnies from the paper in Nick's hands.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been struggling to think of a commendable thing to say about Jerry.

<DIRECTION>
Jerry gives an asinine chuckle at the cartoon. Nick glares.

EXT. GEORGE TWISP'S HOME - DAY

	<DIALOGUE>
	He'd like to own a more prestigious model of BMW, but, as he often reminds me, he is burdened with crippling child support payments.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Nick glances up and spots LACEY, 20, coming up the drive toward him in a weensy bikini. Her body has more outcroppings than the coastline of Albania. She continues past him and embraces George.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lacey is Dad's latest bimbette. She is twenty and a recently minted alumna of Stanfort.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Super: (Stanfort Institute of Cosmetology) George and Lacey exchange saliva shamelessly. Nick turns his attention back to the Beamer. As the making out becomes heated groping, George's grip on the hose slackens. Nick gets blindsided by the jet of water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NICK'S ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We're back with Nick as he types on his computer. He looks down at the tent in his boxers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO: He pulls open the drawer again - the pornography collection.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK'S POV of the room shaking, accompanied by his heavy breathing. His eyes float from the Hustler to the pink walls of his room.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My mother is the one who painted my room to look like Dolly Parton's boudoir. She read this color was used in hospitals to calm mental patients.

BLACKNESS. The masturbation reaches its feverous climax. Then the long moan and sigh of relief.

YOUTH IN REVOLT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ESTELLE'S KITCHEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick regards Jerry from across the dining room table. There is the off-screen sound of a cretin slurping Cheerios. Reveal Jerry reading Sports Illustrated, scratching his balls with one hand and shoveling in cereal with the other. Estelle is washing dishes when she spies something out the window.
</DIRECTION>
<ESTELLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jerry? Where did that car come from?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry looks over his shoulder and they all take a moment to appreciate the slab-sided Lincoln in the drive.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a '62 Lincoln convertible. Like the one Kennedy was shot in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Except his was black and yours is white. And dirty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See that. I was going to take you and your mom for a spin after breakfast. But now I guess it'll just be her and me. You have your smart mouth to thank for that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn it. I guess I'll just have to hang out all alone at the book depository.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<ESTELLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jerry, I don't understand. What happened to the Chevy-Nova?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESTELLE>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sold it to a sailor on the Alameda Naval Air Base. A man should never own a car for more than three months, Estelle. That way he always gets the thrill of owning a new automobile!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry smiles with cretin pride. Nick looks to his mother and disturbingly enough, she seems turned on by his car-owner savvy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ESTELLE'S HOME - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick stands in the doorway watching as his mother waits for Jerry to open the passenger door for her.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	After spending twelve years with Dad, Mom has had a string of lovers, none of whom she has asked me to approve.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry fails to notice Estelle waiting and instead just climbs in and chugs his beer. Estelle appears mildly disappointed before opening the door herself.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm starting to think her boyfriends are like U.S. Presidents.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
As Jerry pulls out, he tosses his beer bottle in the direction of the trash can at the end of the drive.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just when you think they can't get any worse...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He misses and the bottle shatters on the pavement, but Jerry drives off anyway.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
ON A TV SCREEN Nick cycles through TiVo and finds the late night SEX DOCUMENTARY he recorded.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ESTELLE'S KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the living room comes the sound of an orgy and the jingle jangle of a belt buckle. Then the DING-DONG of the front doorbell. The jingle jangle pauses and when the doorbell rings a second time, the orgy gets muted. Nick enters the kitchen pulling up his trousers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. ESTELLE'S HOME - MOMENTS LATER The door is opened to reveal two burly, tattooed SAILORS standing on the stoop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Their eyes drift to Nick's mid-section. Nick follows their eyes to the belt buckle he neglected to fasten out of haste. He returns his gaze to the sailors as he wrangles the belt.
</DIRECTION>
<SAILOR_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is Jerry here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAILOR_1>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He just left. What's up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<SAILOR_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's up is that hunk of shit Chevy he sold us made it seventeen miles before the engine blew up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAILOR_1>
<SAILOR_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And we found evidence of a banana in the transmission.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The second sailor holds aloft the banana peel sealed in a plastic bag. Nick glances to drive and regards the smoking Chevy-Nova with its camouflage paint job. A THIRD SAILOR is rummaging through the boxes in the open garage. He finds some spray-paint and shakes the can. Nick turns back to the sailors on the stoop.
</DIRECTION>
<SAILOR_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So he owes us nine hundred dollars.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAILOR_1>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I think he used that nine hundred dollars to buy his Lincoln. He's giving my mom a joyride in it now. But he'll be back this afternoon, so I would come back then. He's pretty stubborn. You might have to beat it out of him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<SAILOR_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That can be arranged. In the meantime we're leaving the piece of shit in the driveway. With a note.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Nick looks one more time to the Chevy as the third sailor finishes painting the hood with the words: PAY UP OR DIE.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like it. Very to the point. Well... See you guys this afternoon!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The sailors nod, somewhat perplexed by this kid's demeanor. As they turn to go and Nick closes the door...
</DIRECTION>
<LEFTY>

	I might have to kill myself.

EXT. HILLS ABOVE UC CAMPUS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the clearing, a UC JOCK stands behind his ASIAN GIRLFRIEND, kissing her neck and removing her clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope you have a good reason.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Reveal Nick and his friend LEFTY, 16, belly down in the grass overlooking the clearing. Lefty watches the copulating couple with a pair of binoculars.
</DIRECTION>
<LEFTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My sister said she saw Millie Filbert holding hands with some college guy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEFTY>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I dunno, Lefty. I think your sister is just waging psychological warfare.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<LEFTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well it's working. What am I gonna do, Nick? I'm obsessed. I think about Millie so much my balls ache.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEFTY>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe your just not wacking off enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
As if in response, Lefty passes the binoculars off to Nick and then turns over onto his back and unzips his pants. As Lefty jerks it, Nick looks with nonchalance...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THROUGH THE BINOCULARS The couple hump in the grass, her legs in the air.
</DIRECTION>
<LEFTY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, I've been taping my pecker to my right leg at night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEFTY>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In case you haven't heard, Lefty's erect member takes a dramatic turn midway up the shaft.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<LEFTY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then I look at this issue of Better Homes and Gardens that has a girl that looks just like Millie until it gets good and hard. I think it's starting to straighten out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEFTY>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you just have your parents take you to the dick doctor?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<LEFTY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you kidding? It would kill them to know that I even get hard-ons.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEFTY>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Still, you might want to get it fixed before asking Millie out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<LEFTY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	True. What if I shove it up the wrong hole?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Nick gives a dubious glance in Lefty's direction.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lefty's grasp of the female anatomy is somewhat tenuous; he imagines there are orifices galore down there.

</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ESTELLE'S KITCHEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nick, you little shit, get down here!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry hollers from the kitchen where Estelle gapes out the window. Nick calmly joins them from upstairs.
</DIRECTION>
<ESTELLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nick, do you know anything about this?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She points out the window and they all take in the Chevy and the sailors' oh-so-subtle note on the hood.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yeah. Those sailors came by. They want their money back. I guess there was a banana in the transmission.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You tell them when I was coming back?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now why would I do that?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry seeths inwardly at Nick's mock innocence.
</DIRECTION>
<ESTELLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you going to do, Jerry?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESTELLE>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I'll go get the Lincoln washed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<ESTELLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're leaving? What happens when the sailor comes back for his nine- hundred dollars?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESTELLE>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just tell him he bought the car with my standard guarantee. Thirty days or thirty feet. Whichever comes first. I'm in the right.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
And on cue comes the ring of the doorbell and the simultaneous pounding of angry Navy fists on the back door. They peer out the window and find the fleet on the front steps.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, look. The sailors are here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry first starts to dart one way and then another, searching for a hiding space as he hisses.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get rid of them!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
And then the front door gets kicked open and a mob of sailors pour in. Jerry flees. A HANDHELD CAM chase as he heads for the back and is cut off by the sailors coming in. Jerry bolts up the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jerry, where are you going? Just tell them you are in the right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ESTELLE'S HOME - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They manage to grab Jerry by the legs and haul him down the stairs. Jerry loses his grasp step by step, crying with a sound not unlike E.T. when the flashlight hit him in the cornfield. The two big guys with bad haircuts hold Jerry off the ground while the earnstwhile Chevy owner goes through his pockets.
</DIRECTION>
<SAILOR_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sixty-three lousy dollars.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAILOR_1>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's my life savings!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
One of the sailors pokes Jerry in the gut hard and he whimpers.
</DIRECTION>
<ESTELLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't hurt him! Nick, call 911!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESTELLE>
<SAILOR_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Touch that phone, kid, and you lose your left nut.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Nick raises his hands. "You don't have to tell me twice."
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please. Please don't hurt me. It's all I got, guys. I swear. Take the Lincoln!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<SAILOR_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want the Lincoln. I want my nine-hundred dollars. I'm taking the sixty-three, which means you owe me another eight hundred and thirty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAILOR_1>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eight hundred and thirty seven, actually.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<SAILOR_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exactly. Have it by tomorrow or you'll be found in the trunk of your new used piece of shit at the bottom of the Bay.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
And with that they release him and Jerry crumples to the floor like an abandoned marionette.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ESTELLE'S KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The three of them watch the fleet pile into a Navy van that reads FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY. The moment they pull out, Jerry dusts himself off and puts on a pretense of being unfazed.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow, those guys are even dumber than I thought. They actually think I'm stupid enough to let them muscle me into paying.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<ESTELLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jerry, what are you talking about? We need to call the police!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESTELLE>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not some tattle-tale like your son.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Nick rolls his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<ESTELLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then for God's sake, Jerry, just sell the Lincoln and pay them!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESTELLE>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't. It's in The Code.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<ESTELLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What code? The vehicular code?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESTELLE>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Code of the streets, Babe. Code of the streets.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<ESTELLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then what are you planning to do?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry takes a seat at the kitchen table and adopts The Thinker pose. He strokes his chin as Nick and Estelle await his brilliant solution with breathless anticipation.

	<DIALOGUE>
	We are going to Ukiah for a last minute vacation.

Jerry's got on a hat made from Coors beer cans. He's behind the wheel of his Lincoln convertible.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jerry says we'll be staying in a cabin on Clear Lake that's owned by a friend of his.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Estelle dumps in the cooking gear and closes the trunk. Her halter top looks like an advertisement for Droop City. Nick's in the back. Estelle waves at the neighbors like she's Miss Corn Dog of 1954.
</DIRECTION>
<ESTELLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goodbye, everyone! We're going on vacation!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESTELLE>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's blow!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
She hops up front with Jerry. He fires up the Lincoln and the radio roars to life with HILLBILLY MUSIC.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not sure how this is the solution to his problem. But I've decided to go along with it, seeing as I'm not rooting for him anyway.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
As they pull out, Jerry tosses his beer bottle at the garbage can at the end of the drive and it once again misses and shatters on the street behind them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Lincoln makes it's way upstate, and dips into the mist covered hills of Ukiah.

EXT. RESTLESS AXLES TRAILER PARK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They've pulled to a stop. Estelle stares in horror.
</DIRECTION>
<ESTELLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jerry...? You said it was a cabin.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
In the back, Nick removes his sunglasses to regard the long, green, turd of a trailer. Some concrete dwarves in the grass. A dusty canvas awning over a small cement patio. A decrepit picket fence with a sign that reads: MY GREEN HAVEN. Estelle looks as if she's about to cry. Jerry puts his arm around her.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon Estelle. It's real cute on the inside.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MY GREEN HAVEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Substitute cluttered for cute. The three of them are crammed around a dining surface as accommodating as an airplane tray table. 3-D religious art hangs on the wall above them.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I say the kid does the dishes and we retire to the master bedroom.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry pushes out and disappears into the back. Nick watches him with loathing. Estelle smiles apologetically.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mom? Do you really like Jerry?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Her smile fades.

	Nick, how many men do you think there are who'd be interested in a forty-one year old woman with two brats, no money, and stretch marks?
	</DIALOGUE>

And with that she excuses herself, leaving Nick to ponder.

Nick washes dishes in the toilet-like sink. The trailer shakes from the two adults flogging the mattress in the back.

EXT. RESTLESS AXLES TRAILER PARK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An old crone, MRS. SAUNDERS, makes her way up the walk. She gets to the door of My Green Haven and bangs on the screen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MY GREEN HAVEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick sleeps on a pull out cot. He bolts upright at the banging, his hair going in all directions.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_SAUNDERS>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's your neighbor, Mrs. Saunders. Church services begin at seven fifteen prompt. Donuts will be served.

Nick glances down at the morning wood elevating his boxers. Mrs. Saunders narrows her eyes at Nick through the screen door and takes off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MY GREEN HAVEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick steps out of the trailer in a bathrobe, toiletries in one hand, towel in the other. He heads off down the wooded path.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WOODS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The serene melodies of rousing HYMNS float from the well- attended congregation in the meeting hall. WE TRACK across the trees as Nick makes his way down the path. He slows to observe the sun coming through the canopy overhead. He glances off the path and comes to a sudden stop. A grape arbor flanked by Corinthian columns set against the blue of Clear Lake. A chestnut haired SHEENI SAUNDERS stands facing the water, her head tilted down to read the book in her hands. The wind coming off the lake blows her dress just enough to give a hint of the shapely thighs underneath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Light falls in shafts through the latticework of the arbor like something out of a François Boucher painting.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>

(V.O.)

	<DIALOGUE>
	The moment I see her I know the Gods, while having cruelly endowed me with imperfect posture and pussy postponing pimples, had put me here for a purpose. My heart palpitates. My mind races. I get an instant

	T.E.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Super: (Thundering Erection) Sheeni glances up from her book and looks over her shoulder at him. Nick just stares. She gives an amused smile, almost flirtatious. Nick grins back.
</DIRECTION>
<SHEENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your robe is open.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Nick looks down. He pulls the robe closed, scowls, and goes into a flustered march down the path.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PUBLIC REST ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An austere cement shed with three dripping shower heads and no privacy walls. Nick lathers up under the spray. Jerry appears in the foreground and removes his robe. He goes to the shower head next to Nick and turns it on. Nick reacts to Jerry and hastily tries to resume rinsing himself off. Jerry gurgles water and spits. He starts warbling rock lyrics.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MY GREEN HAVEN - DAY

Nick comes up the path and stops short at the picket fence. Estelle and Sheeni squat on the patio steps.

EXT. RESTLESS AXLES TRAILER PARK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A dusty road. Nick totes a watermelon and a paper bag. He watches as Sheeni works on a Popsicle. Full lips that cry out to be kissed.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't have to go to services?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<SHEENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Much to the consternation of my fanatical parents I have converted to atheism. Fortunately my brother, Paul, paved the way for such transgressions.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEENI>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Paul is an atheist too?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<SHEENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Buddhist, I believe, though we have not seen him in some time. I myself am looking forward to being free of parental bondage.

</SHEENI>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Likewise.

</NICK>
<SHEENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, your mother seems very nice, though your father I think might be rather dim.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEENI>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jerry and I share no blood links of any kind.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
As they pass the meeting hall there comes a surge of HYMNS in chorus.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sounds rather zealous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<SHEENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, even though I am no longer a believer I always found the services wonderfully aerobic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEENI>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You could say the same thing about sex.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Sheeni stops. She looks at Nick intently.
</DIRECTION>
<SHEENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nick, are you going to turn out like all the other young men and have nothing on your mind except carnal pleasures?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEENI>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hardly ever think about sex.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<SHEENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? I think about it all the time. It's the hormones at work, you know.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She resumes walking. Nick follows her with confusion.

<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow. A second floor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<SHEENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Father bought it so that he could look down upon the world. For him, Christian humility has always been a struggle.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Sheeni relieves him of the watermelon.
</DIRECTION>
<SHEENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it was nice to meet you, Nick.

She trudges down the slate path to the home.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sheeni? Do you want to come to the beach with me?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She turns around. Gives a little smirk.
</DIRECTION>
<SHEENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What a thoughtful invitation. I'd love to, Nick. Wait for me in the living room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEENI>

A lot more space than My Green Haven. Dark paneling and somewhat more tasteful religious art.
</DIRECTION>
<SHEENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Back in a moment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEENI>
<DIRECTION>
Nick watches her bound up the stairs. He wanders into the musty living area. Moves down the mantel examining the trinkets. Stops to regard the reproduction of Massaccio's Expulsion of Adam and Eve from Eden on the wall. He scrutinizes the image, his eyes falling to the privates of Adam and Eve.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_SAUNDERS>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I understand you have invited my daughter to the beach.
	</DIALOGUE>

Nick spins around to see MR. SAUNDERS reclining in his armchair. He is an immense, florid-faced, verdant eye-browed ogre in a rumpled blue suit.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Er, yes, Mr. Saunders.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<MR_SAUNDERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aha! Then I trust, sir, you are aware that in doing so you have entered into an oral contract to perform in loco parentis, i.e. to provide for the safety and well- being of aforementioned minor female.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Father, do shut up.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Sheeni descends the stairs. Jean cut-offs over a knockout yellow swimsuit that shows off her flowing nubility. Mr. Saunders grumbles. Sheeni grabs up a straw beach bag and pushes Nick out the door.
</DIRECTION>
<SHEENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go, Nick. Bye, Father.

EXT. BEACH - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Sheeni and Nick lay on their backs on the blue beach blanket, reading their respective books. Nick watches her turning pages and making notes in the margins. She hands him her tanning lotion.
</DIRECTION>
<SHEENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you mind applying this to my exposed areas?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEENI>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not at all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
She rolls over onto her stomach, exposing her exquisite back. Nick straddles her, hands shaking as he smooths sweet oils into her tanned flesh. Flashing super: Thundering Erection
</DIRECTION>
<SHEENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My, you get turned on easily.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Nick's hands freeze.
</DIRECTION>
<SHEENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, don't stop, Nick. We all have our hormones to deal with. Girls are fortunate in that it doesn't show. For all the world knows, my vagina could be moist with desire as we speak.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEENI>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<SHEENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's none of your business, I'm sure. Shall you do my front too?

</SHEENI>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm up for it.

She rolls over onto her back, her young breasts straining up against the yellow spandex.
</DIRECTION>
<SHEENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope you don't find it too stimulating, Nick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEENI>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm coping.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He starts in on her flawless legs, gliding on the oil all the way within a finger's reach of her sweet apex. With each daring pass, he comes closer to that final split. Finally the hand swerves too late, and lightly grazes the softly yielding vee.
</DIRECTION>
<SHEENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, Nick. Maybe you better do the top now.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Nick moves up, lubricating her arms, shoulders and neck. He smooths the oil on the soft undulating foothills.
</DIRECTION>
<SHEENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, Nick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEENI>

She rolls back onto her stomach with finality and goes back to her book. Nick hovers above her a moment, then painfully returns to his own reading.

They make their way down the path. Nick totes the beach bag.

<SHEENI>

	Breathless is one of my favorite films, though it might be eclipsed by Rebel Without a Cause. I often wonder what American cinema would be like today had Dean done more than three.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Nick nods, and for a beat they trek on in silence. He glances down at her hand and fumbles for it with his own.
</DIRECTION>
<SHEENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Nick. You seem very nice. But in fairness, I should tell you that I have a boyfriend.

Pendulous breasts, sagging skin, a patch of white hair under a drooping belly, wrinkles... It's Mrs. Saunders! She looks up startled. Nick lets out a horrible woman-like scream. Mrs. Saunders starts screaming too, the sound of a pig being slaughtered. She hurls a bar of soap. The bar strikes Nick upside the head and he loses his footing on the slippery tile. He goes down, taking Mrs. Saunders with him. They wrangle in the mist as Nick tries to escape.

	RAPE! RAAAAAPE!

Suddenly the door opens. It's Sheeni in her robe. She reaches out and pulls Nick up.
</DIRECTION>
<SHEENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get out quick!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Still wearing her robe, she dives into the spray to save her mother. Nick grabs his robe and retreats.

INT. CAFE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick slouches in a corner of the shop, his hands trembling as he brings his coffee to his lips. He hears the door open and looks up, but instead of the cops finds Sheeni. She joins him at the table.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Should I go to the sheriff's now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<SHEENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I managed to convince Mother you were retarded and couldn't read the sign.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEENI>

Nick nods thankfully.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say, where were you anyway? We said five minutes to six.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<SHEENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. But, Nick, women are always discreetly late. It's expected of us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEENI>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Swell. And the punctual guy fries in the chair for rape.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>

	<DIALOGUE>
	What are your plans today?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEENI>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My parents want to go to Middletown. Jerry has the moronic notion of buying a trailer there before we leave.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<SHEENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I should like to come with you, Nick. The more time we spend together the better. I fear when you leave we might never see each other again.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Nick nods glumly. Clearly a devastating thought.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LINCOLN (MOVING) - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sheeni's in back with Nick, but doesn't seem to mind the wind tunnel. She has a scarf tied around her chestnut locks. Nick looks down as she casually rests a hand on the inside of his thigh. As they round a curve at 60, she yanks Nick's sunglasses off and tosses them over her shoulder into the lake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GEEZER'S MANOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Estelle, Jerry, Nick, and a toothless old GEEZER whose gut rivals Jerry's, all stare at a rusty RV that looks like it might not make the trip back. In the background, Sheeni pets a goat in the dusty yard.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's your cash price?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<GEEZER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said in the ad. Thousand dollars firm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEEZER>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thousand, huh? That must be with a guarantee.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<GEEZER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As is, where she is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEEZER>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. Those rusty propane tanks are a fire hazard. The roof probably needs work. I couldn't go above eight hundred.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The geezer ponders the bad news. Estelle shakes her head and goes inside the RV to inspect.
</DIRECTION>
<ESTELLE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are mouse droppings in all the closets, Jerry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESTELLE>
<GEEZER>

	I might take nine fifty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEEZER>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nine hundred.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Sheeni lets out a squeal of delight. They all turn their attention to where she has discovered a box full of squirming
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PUPPIES. She brings one of them over.
</DIRECTION>
<SHEENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Nick!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She shows him the ugly little pug. Short droopy ears, a tiny, batlike face.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<SHEENI>
<DIRECTION>
(to the geezer)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How much?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEENI>
<GEEZER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ten dollars.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Sheeni turns to Nick pleadingly. Nick fishes through his wallet.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All I have is a Subway card with four stickers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<GEEZER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sold.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEEZER>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No doubt close to the dog's actual value.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<SHEENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, thank you, Nickie!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She plants a kiss on his lips and promptly turns her attention to the dog, who licks her face affectionately. Nick looks on with appropriate jealousy.
</DIRECTION>
<SHEENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to name him Albert.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pronounced Al-bear)
</DIRECTION>
<GEEZER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That don't sound like any kind of name for a dog.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEEZER>
<SHEENI>
<DIRECTION>
(scowling defensively)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll have you know I've named him after the deceased French writer, Albert Camus. Author of L'Etranger and other works of existential brilliance.

The geezer looks to Nick with an expression of "I stand corrected." Nick returns with a nod that says "You have no idea."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LINCOLN (MOVING) - DAY

The Lincoln now tows the rusty RV behind it. Nick watches Sheeni continue to fawn over Albert.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAFE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick and Sheeni dine over coffee and a plate of donuts. Nick watches her play with Albert in her lap.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sheeni, I think I love you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<SHEENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, your hormones certainly do. And oddly enough, my hormones like you too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEENI>
<DIRECTION>
Sheeni releases Albert and the mutt paws at her legs. Her eyes well up with tears, a few theatrical sniffles.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sheeni? It's... It's okay. We can visit each other when I get a drivers license.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<SHEENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope that's true, but.. It's not that. It's...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEENI>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<SHEENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's my parents. They're... I fear they will never allow me to keep Albert.

	</DIALOGUE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<SHEENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At least you could consider it, honey. For me. I've never asked you for anything before.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEENI>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe I could take him, but I'd have certain conditions. I would have to be the only dad on the scene.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(matter of fact)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Trent would have to go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<SHEENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's asking a lot. Trent worships the ground I walk on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEENI>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's your choice. Life with me and the dog you love. Or a pet-free existence with a shallow, egotistical poet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Sheeni ponders this.
</DIRECTION>
<SHEENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OK, Nick, I guess I don't have any choice. I'll break up with Trent. But if he kills himself it's on your conscience.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEENI>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I accept full responsibility.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<SHEENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, good, that's settled.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEENI>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not quite, darling. I want one more thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<SHEENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEENI>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. Sheeni looks pensive. It fades to amusement.
</DIRECTION>
<SHEENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you have a condom?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Nick lifts his eyebrows. Now we're getting somewhere!
</DIRECTION>
<SHEENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It has to be in a safe place. A nice comfortable bed. With no threat of interruptions. And for relaxation and mood setting some good red wine, preferably French. I want a new condom. Not one that's been riding around in your wallet for years. Consumers rated them a while back. I suggest you get their top-rated brand. This may take some research in the library. I'd appreciate a photocopy of the article. Plus, for supplementary protection, I want a name brand spermicide.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEENI>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about I have a quick vasectomy just to be on the safe side?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<SHEENI>
<DIRECTION>
(matter of fact)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Nick, that, of course, is up to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEENI>
<DIRECTION>
Nick looks displeased that his sarcasm didn't register.

Jerry hitches the trailer to the back of the Lincoln. Estelle loads up the trunk.
</DIRECTION>
<ESTELLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nick, honey, say goodbye to Sheeni. It's time to hit the road.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Nick watches Sheeni kiss Albert. He looks less than enthused at the thought of sloppy-seconds. Finally Sheeni hands Nick the dog. Nick and Sheeni stand there an awkward beat. Sheeni leans in and gives him a peck on the cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<SHEENI>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering in his ear)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't forget, darling. Red wine and Consumer Reports.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles. They're the sexiest words Nick's ever heard. He grabs her and kisses her deeply. Jerry HONKS the horn and they break off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LINCOLN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick gets into the back seat with Albert. The dog whimpers. Sheeni stands off to the side, waving at them both.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Back to civilization!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He fires up the Lincoln and they kick up dust. Albert slobbers all over Nick. Nick sets him down and watches Sheeni in the side-mirror, waving in the road.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have a tall mountain to climb, with many treacherous glaciers still to cross, but finally, I have obtained a stamped entry visa to the paradise that lay beyond.

Sheeni watches the Lincoln and trailer recede toward the horizon.

</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ESTELLE'S HOME - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry backs the RV into the drive as Nick helps his mother with her belongings and they enter the house. The RV scrapes its way through a few overhanging tree branches before Jerry decides it's parked. There comes a woman's scream from inside the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ESTELLE'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry joins Nick and Estelle in the doorway. There in the living room, surrounded by all the furniture pushed neatly against the walls, is Jerry's camouflaged Chevy.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess they didn't cave after all.
	</DIALOGUE>

Jerry pops the hood and lets out a whistle.

	Boy, everything's complete. There's even water in the windshield washer.

</JERRY>
<ESTELLE>

	How did they ever get it in here? My front door can't be more than three feet wide.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESTELLE>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looks like they brought it in piece by piece and then reassembled it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<ESTELLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But it would take an army of mechanics to do all that!
	</DIALOGUE>

Jerry slams down the hood.

<DIRECTION>
The family dines over take-out fried chicken. Jerry kicks Albert and the puppy goes tumbling across the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<ESTELLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know, Jerry. Can someone do something about the monstrosity dripping oil in my living room?

	Yeah, I noticed that. What's the story?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOANIE>
<NICK>

<DIRECTION>
Jerry contemplates smacking Nick upside the head, but decides against it when he discerns Estelle is probably in her son's corner.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OK, Babe, I guess when I come back from my next haul I'll just have to take it apart piece by piece.

Nick puffs out his chest. Joanie looks down at her boob-job.

	Hardly. Sheeni believes the internet will be the end of literacy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<JOANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So it's to be a torturous snail mail exchange, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOANIE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	More like the occassional collect call.

</NICK>
<ESTELLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Collect calls? And just who do you expect to pay for that?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Nick. Want to learn how a car is put together?

Jerry lurches backward in the chair and lands on the floor, revealing that Albert's teeth have a firm grasp on Jerry's sack. The dog shakes the scrotum in his jaws.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn it! The dog!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He tries to swipe Albert with his beer bottle, but the dog retreats into the house, leaving Jerry rolling around on the floor. Joanie and Nick exchange a smile. The phone rings. Estelle gets up to answer it.

<SHEENI>

	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you want me to do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<SHEENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I propose you rent the film Rebel Without a Cause as soon as possible. You must emulate James Dean...

<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON her GLOSSY LIPS.
</DIRECTION>
<SHEENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...You must be bad, Nickie. Be very, very bad.

<DIRECTION>
A glint of resolve in Nick's eyes.

<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will, darling. I will!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
And in pre-lap comes the DING DONG of the doorbell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ESTELLE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joanie and Nick sit in the Chevy Nova watching Rebel Without a Cause through the windshield.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Estelle enters the living room with tears streaming down her face and a police officer, LANCE WESCOTT, 45, with a flattop, watery red eyes, and assorted guns, flashlights, and billy clubs.
</DIRECTION>
<ESTELLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kids? This is Officer Lance Wescott. He has some bad news.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
After a beat, Nick rolls down the window.
</DIRECTION>
<LANCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your mother's friend Jerry had a heart attack in a bar in Dallas. He's dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Estelle sobs, but isn't joined by her children. She turns to Lance.
</DIRECTION>
<ESTELLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will they be sending his belongings?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESTELLE>
<LANCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh... I'm afraid they've already been sent. To his wife.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. Nick looks to Joanie. They both look to their mother.
</DIRECTION>
<ESTELLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His... His wife?!?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She bursts into tears and collapses into Officer Lance Wescott's arms.
</DIRECTION>
<LANCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There, there, Ma'am. It's going to be okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Nick watches his mother sobbing against the cop's chest for a beat before he rolls up the window and he and Joanie resume watching the movie. Estelle's cries of despair become...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NICK'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
....the cries of ecstasy coming through the wall along with the repeated exclamation of Lance's name. Nick rolls over in bed. Bloodshot eyes. He hauls himself out of bed.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I have decided to create a supplementary persona named François.

<DIRECTION>
He stands in front of the mirror and leans in.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like a Parisian James Dean, he will be bold, reckless, contemptuous of authority, and irresistible to women.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
PUSH IN on his reflection, as a moustache appears. Then a beret and black and white striped shirt. Then a cigarette holder and Thompson machine-gun. And FRANÇOIS is born.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>

	Hello, François. I think you'll do nicely.

Nick comes down the stairs. He reaches the water heater and starts spinning the knob.

The forms of Estelle and Lance in the shower can be made out. They both start screaming as they are blasted with cold water. The blobs of their bodies press up against the glass.

Albert looks up at Nick and lets out a BARK. Nick smiles and bends down to undo his leash.

INT. ESTELLE'S HOME - HALLWAY -DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lance bursts from the bathroom in his boxers, looking for blood. He hears the sound of paws climbing the stairs. Albert comes hurtling around he corner, almost losing his footing on the hardwood floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALBERT'S POV as we lunge at Lance's crotch.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. ESTELLE'S HOME - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BLOODCURDLING SCREAM rises up from the home.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ESTELLE'S KITCHEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>

Estelle hands Lance an ice-pack and he applies it to his injury. Nick wanders in and takes his seat at the table.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>

</NICK>
<ESTELLE>

</ESTELLE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No doubt. I don't think anyone got a wink last night with all that racket.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Lance looks at him, seething inwardly. He glances to Estelle.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought there were laws in this city against illicit cohabitation. Or are they just another big policeman's joke?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<LANCE>

	Kid, you are asking for trouble.

<NICK>

Lance lunges across the table.
</DIRECTION>
<ESTELLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Lance! Nickie, go to your room.

Nick flings down his napkin and heads for the front door.

<ESTELLE>

	Where do you think you're going?
	</DIALOGUE>

The screen door slams behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GARAGE - DAY

The garage door rattles upward, illuminating the cardboard box of paint supplies. Nick bends down and picks up a can of aerosol spray-paint. He shakes it.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. ESTELLE'S HOME - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick sprays the trailer in wide sweeping motions.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ESTELLE'S HOME - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joanie and Nick sun bathe in the lawn chairs. Estelle stands over them.
</DIRECTION>
<ESTELLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the in God's name has gotten into you?!? Jerry paid good money for that trailer!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESTELLE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And just what makes you so sure it was me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<ESTELLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who the hell else would write such a thing?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Estelle gestures to the trailer, which we can see has been defaced with the words GOD'S PERFECT ASSHOLE.
</DIRECTION>
<ESTELLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And just how do you explain this?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She holds up a semi-nude Polaroid of Lacey.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's Lacey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<ESTELLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And just who the hell is Lacey?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESTELLE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad's girlfriend.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Estelle stares at the photo, face contorted by revulsion and envy.
</DIRECTION>
<ESTELLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His girlfriend? What are you doing with a picture like this of your father's girlfriend?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESTELLE>
<JOANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, Mom, all boys his age have pictures like that to...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOANIE>
<ESTELLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When I want your opinion on raising my child, I'll ask for it.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CURIOUS)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what's this Lacey tart like?
	</DIALOGUE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, she likes fast cars and takes a lot of naps with dad.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Super: (True)
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She likes to sit on Dad's lap while he eats and blow in his ear.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Super: (Not true)
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And she calls him "Thunder Rod" and he calls her "Sugar Puss."
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Super: (True; believe it or not) At this point Estelle has turned bright red.
</DIRECTION>
<ESTELLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are confined to your room until school starts, you sick pervert.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She stalks off. Joanie glances over at Nick with amusement.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wish I was leaving with you tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<JOANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your day will come. I never thought mine would, but it did. Was all that stuff about Lacey and Dad made up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOANIE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wish. Did you really take a posture class?
	</DIALOGUE>

INT. NICK'S ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A knock on the door. Lefty enters the room and Nick pulls the headphones off his ears.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Lefty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<LEFTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's with your mom, Nick? She gave me the third degree just to come up here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEFTY>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I vandalized Jerry's trailer and she found my picture of Lacey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<LEFTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, good thing I stole this from the bookstore then.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Lefty unzips his backpack and produces a large hardbound volume titled Lovemaking for Advanced Gourmets.
</DIRECTION>
<LEFTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was reading it all last night. Boy, having sex is a lot more complicated than I thought. Did you know you were supposed to stick your pinkie in her bumhole?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEFTY>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You lie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<LEFTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No way, man. Here, I got the page marked.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Lefty flops down on the sofa next to Nick and the two of them flip through the manual.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but I'm not sure I should try this on Sheeni. I think this book is for people who've been married so long they're disgusted by the sight of each other.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They regard the illustrated figures of men and women in various states of foreplay.
</DIRECTION>
<LEFTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are we really supposed to be that... uh... big?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEFTY>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think these illustrations are disproportionate for emphasis.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<LEFTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe we should compare.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEFTY>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps we should. Just for the sake of research.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Nick and Lefty get to their feet and stand opposite each other like a pair of duelists. They simultaneously undo their belts and pull their pants and underwear to their feet. They straighten. Lefty's eyes fall to Nick's crotch. He gets a hint of concern in his expression. Nick stares at Lefty's, tilting his head to compensate for the curvature. The door behind them opens and Estelle appears toting Nick's lunch. She lets out a scream. The boys turn to face her, pants around their ankles.
</DIRECTION>
<ESTELLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	PERVERTS!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She hurls the tray of food at them. Lefty bolts. Nick hastily tries to pull up his pants as his mother chases him around the room, grabbing up objects and hurling them his way.
</DIRECTION>
<ESTELLE>

	FRIGGIN' GODDAMN PERVERTS!

</DIRECTION>
<ESTELLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You won't get away! I'm calling your parents! PERVERTS!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Nick bursts from the room, desperately trying to buckle his pants. Estelle is hot on his heels, wielding the hardbound sex manual as they round the bannister.
</DIRECTION>
<ESTELLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In my house! How dare you!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She catches up to Nick at the top of the stairs and cracks him upside the head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He loses his balance and goes tumbling down the staircase, letting out a moan that stutters as his head hits each step. He comes crashing into the foyer, landing on the slate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NICK'S ROOM - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick watches out the window. Estelle can be seen animatedly describing the events to LEFTY'S PARENTS. Lefty glances up at Nick and gives a pained expression.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NICK'S ROOM - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick lays on his belly reading No Exit. He looks up when he hears the sound of footsteps in the hall. Shadows appear beneath the crack in the door. Estelle opens the door and looks down at him.
</DIRECTION>
<ESTELLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nick, I just want you to know that I've thought about it, and I've accepted that you are gay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESTELLE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks a pantsful, but I'm not gay. If you're really concerned though, I suggest you get me a room at the Ukiah Motel 6. If anyone can straighten me out, it's Sheeni.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him dubiously and hands out the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<ESTELLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That sounds more like a job for your father. Here, he wants to talk to you.
	</DIALOGUE>

Nick takes the phone from her hands and she closes the door.

EXT. OAKLAND PUBLIC SCHOOL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Intimidating PUNK MUSIC. School bus doors fold open and Nick steps off. The MUSIC pounds from the boom box resting on the hood of the Mustang GT where a pack of SKINHEADS follow Nick with their eyes. Nick walks past them, glancing over at the assembly of ASIAN GANGSTERS glaring at him from their perch on the wall.

The trailer clips the corner of the house. Chunks of stucco fall and the galvanized downspout shudders and writhes, collapsing the long rain gutter running across the front of the home. Nick guns it, and with a lurch the trailer splinters free. He dodges the birch tree, but plows over the smaller Asian pear. The Lincoln bounces the curb and catapults into the street, the trailer weaving back and forth, smashing parked cars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LINCOLN (MOVING) - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick cruises along sedately. He plays with the radio and settles on the Sex Pistols. He looks up just in time to see the red light and slams on the brakes, nearly jack-knifing the trailer. The light turns green and the car lumbers up the long hill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BERKELEY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick hits the bump in the road right before the stop sign. The car bottoms out. The trailer bounces up, coming unhitched.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. LINCOLN (MOVING) - DAY Nick hits the gas and the Lincoln suddenly surges forward, released from the great weight. Nick smiles. Behind him, through the rear window, the trailer can be seen receding into the distance. He glances into the mirror and spots the trailer plunging down the hill. Then he crashes into the Fiat parked in front of him at the intersection. The gas tank on the Fiat cracks, spurting fuel onto the pavement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BERKELEY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick leaps from the Lincoln and watches open-mouthed as the vehicular ballet unfolds. Down the hill - the speeding trailer sideswipes a delivery van and goes into a spin. The BOHEMIANS sipping espresso at the outdoor café look up to see the words GOD'S PERFECT ASSHOLE bearing down on them. The delivery van veers out of control. The Bohemians scatter. The truck runs over a fire hydrant and smashes its way through the patio furniture and into the café. A geyser of water plumes where the hydrant once stood. The trailer resumes its downward plunge toward the busy cross street below. KWOMP! Nick turns to see the still-restive Lincoln part from the Fiat and begin to roll down the hill after its partner.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh no! I forgot to set the brake!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The DRIVER OF THE FIAT bolts after the accelerating Lincoln, but as he realizes the futility, slows to a jog. The driver turns to see he forgot to set his own brake, and desperately rolls out of the way of the Fiat. MOTORISTS slam on their brakes as the speeding trailer crosses four lanes of traffic. It jumps the curb crashing into the plate glass window of a gourmet sausage shop. A cop car lights up and speeds into the intersection, just in time to get clipped by the Lincoln. The cop car goes into a tail spin, smashing into a chicken transport. The flock of feathered inmates fly for freedom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Lincoln continues to generate momentum on its slalom run, thundering past the stopped cars and into the wrecked building like a runaway express train. The gas cannisters in the trunk ignite and the sausage shop explodes, the trailer's two propane tanks going off like bombs. The Fiat comes flying into the flaming mess and blasts apart, sending shards of metal and sausage links to go raining down on the spectators. The blaze lights the trail of gasoline left by the broken fuel tank and a stream of liquid fire races up the hill, ending at Nick's feet. Nick takes a moment to watch in horror as dark plumes of smoke billow into the sky, the geyser of water, the storm of dazed chickens. He turns around and does his best to inconspicuously walk OUT OF FRAME.

INT. ESTELLE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

	Oh, Lance, can't something be done?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESTELLE>
<LANCE>

INT. NICK'S ROOM - NIGHT

Nick let's out a yelp of pain as Lance brings a broken tree limb against his bare bottom. WHACK! WHACK! WHACK!
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't scream much. I am making a painful sacrifice for The Woman Of My Dreams. My suffering possesses a beauty which elevates it above this sordid scene.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
With the final blow the tree limb cracks in half. Nick looks over his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you through?

Lance looks around the room. Picks up an umbrella and considers it in his hand. Nick hangs his head.

The BMW pulls into the drive of the house - a plywood rectangle perched on cement blocks. Aluminum windows. A swamp cooler on the shallow-pitched roof. They all emerge from the car.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go ahead and bring your stuff inside. Lacey and I need a nap. C'mon, Sugar Puss.
	</DIALOGUE>

Nick watches longingly as George leads Lacey into the home. As he places his hand on Lacey's ass, he looks back over his shoulder and throws a smug look in Nick's direction.

Nick reaches the door and gently knocks. But it's Sheeni's ogre of a father who answers the door and stares at Nick sternly.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uhm, hello. Is Sheeni available?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<MR_SAUNDERS>

<MR_SAUNDERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then I guess it's a good thing Trent is going there too. She'll have someone to console her.

And with that, Mr. Saunders slams the door so hard in Nick's face that the entire two story mobile home rocks back and forth.

Nick lights up at the sight of her and they embrace. They kiss passionately. He works his way to her neck and starts to reach under the sweatshirt.

<DIRECTION>
Nick shrugs and opens the top dresser drawer, revealing Lacey's lingerie. Nick starts dancing, doing a strip tease for himself. WE PAN AROUND the room, and when we reach Nick again, he's wearing nothing but a pair of Lacey's thongs. He models in front of the mirror, regarding his bulging T.E. He removes a C-cup bra and holds it high. He uses the elastic straps to fasten the bra onto his head. He starts dancing up a storm to the cheesy Vengaboys rendition of BRAZIL in his head. Waving arms. Bicycling leg movements.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he backs up we can see that George is watching him from the doorway, a Safeway bag in his arms. Lacey peers over his shoulder. The MUSIC halts abruptly.

EXT. MY GREEN HAVEN - DAY

He stops at the familiar sight of My Green Haven. He gets an amused smile and sighs with nostalgia. The front door of the trailer opens and Lefty emerges. Nick furrows his brow in confusion as Lefty locks the door and comes down the path.

	I mean, what are you doing in town?

<LEFTY>

	I did what you told me, Nick. I threw my backpack off the pier and reported my own suicide. I even left a note.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEFTY>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow, Lefty, I'm kinda impressed. Faking your suicide is pretty ballsy.

Nick hands over the letter and Vijay starts reading it silently. He chuckles as he reads and Nick squints his eyes at him in annoyance. Vijay picks up on it, clears his throat and reads aloud.

An empty hall. The SNEAKY STRINGS of NIGHT ON BALD MOUNTAIN. Sheeni rounds the corner at the far end. As she and Heather sneak the boys down, the other OCCUPANTS of the floor giggle in French and dart from door to door in near-undress.

	Well, see you guys in the morning.

The door closes and Vijay and Nick exchange a knowing glance.

Sheeni steps into the tiny closet to change. Vijay and Nick regard the...

	We must wait until everyone falls asleep.

Nick tries to appear unconcerned. She gives him a kiss and climbs into her narrow bed. As Nick and Vijay prepare their sleeping bags on the floor, they watch Taggarty climb up to her bunk in the sky.
</DIRECTION>
<TAGGERTY>

	Goodnight boys. Do you need the light on to take off your clothes?

<DIRECTION>
A beat of BLACKNESS. Then a light tap at the door. There is the sound of Sheeni getting out of bed. She cracks the door, letting in just enough light from the hall that a MALE SHADOW gets cast across the two boys on the floor. Nick squints and tries to hear what Sheeni and the male shadow are whispering to each other. After a beat, Sheeni closes the door and the room plunges into BLACKNESS once again. Nick listens as Sheeni climbs back into bed as if nothing happened.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>

</SHEENI>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So where is Trent now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<SHEENI>

	I assume he went back to the boys' dorm. Now really, Nickie, you are keeping everyone awake with your inquiries.

Though silence follows, we take a moment to allow Nick's mind to race in the dark. He stands and looks at the mirror above the dresser. François can be made out sitting by the window in the moonlight, stroking the Thompson.

	Now is our chance.

<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chance for what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<FRANÇOIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To confront our nemesis. We must go to the boys' dorm and kill Trent where he sleeps.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANÇOIS>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I suppose we should at least get a look at him. To see what we're dealing with.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick makes his way down the hall, checking the names on the colored paper cut-out shapes that adorn the doors. He stops and backtracks when he spots the door that boasts the names TRENT and ED. Nick knocks on the door. It opens inward to reveal a bare-chested, hulking athlete in a pajama pants. This is ED SOLOMON.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>

<ED>

</ED>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did he say where he was going?

</NICK>
<ED>

</ED>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But that's where Lefty is. Who are you?

</NICK>
<ED>

	Ed. Ed Solomon. Trent's roommate.

</ED>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, so you're Ed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that supposed to mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing. It's just that Sheeni mentioned Trent has a thing for a guy named Ed, and that he touches the guy when he falls asleep. But obviously if that were you, you'd know about it. Must be a different Ed Solomon. Take care now.

Nick takes off running and Ed stares after him.

EXT. ECOLE DES ARTS ET LITTERATURE - GROUNDS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The security van continues to make its rounds. We find Nick crouching behind the steps to the boys dorm. He pulls the hood of his windbreaker over his head and takes a deep breath. As the searchlight passes by, he makes a break for it. TRACK with Nick as he darts from one form of cover to the next, perhaps accompanied by the imagined sounds of mortar blasts and machine gun turret fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At long last he reaches the girls' dorm undetected.

</NICK>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He didn't say, but I'm pretty sure I just saw him go into our bathroom down the hall.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks. Oh, and I'd be careful with those condoms. Trent's roommate Ed said that Trent pokes holes in them so that he can get Sheeni pregnant and be with her forever.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
And with that piece of disturbing info, he leaves them.

<DIRECTION>
INT. GIRL'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is the CLAP of thunder outside as Nick throws open the door to the girls' bathroom. He looks around with murderous rage. There comes the sound of someone vomiting. Nick kicks in the stall and finds BERNICE LYNCH, 17, a thin platinum haired girl with six earrings per lobe. She hurls into the toilet again and turns around to find Nick.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNICE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm Sheeni's friend, Nick. Sorry to disturb you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<BERNICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's OK. It was something I ate. So wait, are you Sheeni's boyfriend?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNICE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<BERNICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My name's Bernice. Bernice Lynch. Not that you asked.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNICE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice to meet you Bernice. Actually, I think Trent Preston mentioned you. He said you were frumpy, but now that I've met you, I can see Trent is a lying bastard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<BERNICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks. And Trent can go to hell for all I care. Sheeni too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNICE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't like Sheeni?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<BERNICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Personally, I hate her guts. Well, pardon me, Nick. I feel like throwing up some more now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNICE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't happen to see Trent Preston did you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She waves him away as she bends over the sink to hurl again. Then lifts her face and smiles through the dripping bile.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I did actually. I think he was on his way to Sheeni's room.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Nick's eyes widen in alarm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SHEENI'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick enters the dark room to the sound of the bed squeaking. Vijay and Taggarty grunt away on the top bunk. He watches the moon lit forms thumping together. He turns his attention to the sleeping beauty on the bottom bunk. He moves toward her. She blinks, waking and smiles at the sight of him.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sheeni?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<SHEENI>
	<DIALOGUE>

<SHEENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Nick.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Nick hangs his head.
</DIRECTION>
<SHEENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I sent him away again.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Nick stares into her eyes to discern her honesty, but he finds nothing but adoration.
</DIRECTION>
<SHEENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I want you, darling. Not even Trent can match the industriousness and tenacity with which you have pursued me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEENI>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles. Nick smiles too. She reaches out to pull him into her bed as... The door to the room slams open and they are suddenly backlit by the harsh beam of the matron's flashlight.
</DIRECTION>
<MATRON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Q'est que c'est passer ici?!?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Nick bolts upright, smacking his head against the top bunk. He lands on the floor, where he gets a view of... Trent standing behind the matron. The blinding light makes his features difficult to make out but his white teeth are definitely smiling diabolically.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GIRLS' DORM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boys come out of the front door of the dormitory, the matron, flanked by SCHOOL SECURITY GUARDS, hot on their heels. The girls in the dorm appear on the balcony in droves, cheering the boys' escape. Vijay's pants fall to his ankles, tripping him up. Nick and Lefty grab Vijay by the arms and pull him up again as if he were a wounded war buddy in a retreat from the Vietnamese Army. They reach the Beamer at the edge of the grounds. Nick gets in first. Lefty dives through the back window, legs kicking. Vijay slams the door just as the matron and her security team catches up to them. The authorities bang on the windows as Nick peels out. INDIAN POP blares from the car. They speed off into the night.
</DIRECTION>

</VIJAY>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
<VIJAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What will we do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIJAY>
<NICK>

The three boys are still standing in the rain by the pay phone. The three of them huddle under their only windbreaker. A pair of headlights appear in the rain. The headlights flash twice and Nick runs out into the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV TRUCK DRIVER Nick waving frantically in nothing but tightie-whities. The truck pulls to a stop and the passenger door opens to reveal, the driver, a man named WALLY RUMPKIN, a seven foot tall giant in a plaid shirt and bib overalls. He looks down at our three waylaid adventurers.
</DIRECTION>
<WALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pardon me. But is one of you Nick Twisp?
	</DIALOGUE>

The two other boys exchange confused glances, not entirely if this is how people go missing.

	Yeah. I'm Nick.

</NICK>
<WALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm Wally. I'm a friend of your mom's.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Nick nods, not yet sure whether or not this gentle giant is actually blushing with shyness or red with agitation at being sent on a midnight mission.
</DIRECTION>
<WALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, uhm, uh... Your mom says you need a ride. Did I mention I'm a friend?

	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Estelle's face registers "none of your business," but a kind look from Wally and she softens.
</DIRECTION>
<ESTELLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lance is busy training to be a detective. He isn't around as much as he used to be.
	</DIALOGUE>

Nick nods and goes back to eating.

Estelle smiles with pride. Nick and the other boys regard the gentle giant with admiration. He bashfully averts his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<ESTELLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's nothing. You should see what he did with the living room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESTELLE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ESTELLE'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick and the other two boys pause in the doorway. Where once the Chevy occupied the space, the living room was now fairly returned to it's normal uncluttered state with all the furniture placed back in the original positions. At some point Wally must have sawed a hole in the wall shared by the living and dining areas because the Chevy now occupies that hole and has been painted and decorated such that it has achieved an almost seamless blend with the wall. Estelle goes and takes a seat on the couch.
</DIRECTION>
<ESTELLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go ahead, Wally. Show them.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Wally blushes before he flips a switch and the tail lights come on, giving the living room a warm, flattering glow.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK_LEFTY_VIJAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ooooooh.
	</DIALOGUE>

Wally flips another switch and the car's radio turns on.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK_LEFTY_VIJAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aaaaaaah.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Wally makes a slightly embarrassed gesture of scratching his head before lumbering over to the couch and taking a seat next to Estelle. Nick watches as Wally puts his arm around his mother and they listen to the Chevy play them Elvis' LOVE ME TENDER. The two adults snuggle in the glow of the tail lights and it brings an unexpected rush of caring in his expression.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. UKIAH - DAY

The truck rumbles to a stop and the three boys climb out. Nick looks, over his shoulder at Wally blushing behind the wheel of the truck.

	</DIALOGUE>
</WALLY>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You too, Mr. Rumpkin.

Wally blushes even more. He closes the door and starts to turn the truck around. Nick watches him go. Wally waves goodbye. Nick turns and the three boys make their way down the dusty road.

Nick seethes inwardly. There comes a ruckus from the back bedroom and Lacey emerges.

George lunges and Paul socks him in the eye, dropping him to the floor.

	You are in serious trouble. You've assaulted me and I know for a fact that you two were having naked orgies with my son. That child is only twelve years old.

Sheeni narrows her eyes at him. A long beat as they all dine in silence. Then- Mrs. Saunders croaks out in song.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<TAGGARTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Trent, you made it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Nick glances up with a start as TRENT PRESTON makes his entrance. He's not quite the deity Nick's expected, but rather a fairly plain, blond with slightly androgenous features and a certain flamboyance. His black eye, courtesy of Ed Solomon, still remains.
</DIRECTION>
<TRENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Taggarty. Hello, Everyone.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Saunders grunts his acknowledgement as he takes the pitcher and pours water into his own lap.

<SHEENI>

	Trent, darling, this is Nick.

Sheeni and Taggarty gasp. Nick swallows hard.

<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you obtain proper authorization from the officials?

</NICK>
<TRENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Nick, I acted on my own initiative. In Bernice's closet, I found this letter.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He dramatically extracts the letter from his pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<TRENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In the letter, the writer instructed Bernice to begin sedating Sheeni with drugs he himself supplied.

	I can't arrest him. But I have called the Santa Cruz Police. They are on their way here now.

Nick places his napkin next to his plate and stands.

Nick stops in front of Trent.

<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you for that unsolicited counsel, Trent. And please, do drop dead.

The other guests murmur their shock. Nick stops in the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goodbye, Sheeni. I did it all for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<SHEENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are completely contemptible, Nick Twisp. I never wish to see you again.

	Since my sister can see through me, I'm obliged to give a relatively candid and thorough review of the events.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Joanie listens gravely, shaking her head at the most gruesome parts of the story. Nick finishes, flopping into a chair.
</DIRECTION>
<JOANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nick, six months ago you were just another brownnosing honor student. What happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOANIE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not really sure. I fell in love with Sheeni. All I want is to be with her. The rest is all a big misunderstanding.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<JOANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nick, you've stolen, vandalized, trespassed, and burned down Berkeley. All for one girl. If there's a misunderstanding, it's with your insight into females.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOANIE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But... But where did I go wrong?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<JOANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nick, boys your age are always looking for the path of least resistance to becoming a man. A boy's whole self-esteem rests on how fast he can get a girl into bed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOANIE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So far, I agree.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<JOANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sooner or later what those boys realize, is that the girls you're chasing base their self-esteem on how many hoops they can get the boy to jump through before going to bed with him.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Nick furrows his brow. Clearly that had not occurred to him.
</DIRECTION>
<JOANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So I guess what you should ask yourself is: How far are you willing to go?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOANIE>
<DIRECTION>
Nick nods in understanding. An epiphanic smile.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All the way, Joanie. I'm willing to go all the way.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Joanie nods in amusement.
</DIRECTION>
<JOANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can stay here a couple days, but eventually they'll come looking for you. I don't have much money to give you, but here.
	</DIALOGUE>

Nick takes the wad of cash, clearly moved.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, Joanie. I... Uh... I love you.

</NICK>
<LEFTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Home. I'm done being dead, Nick. Heather and I are going back to Oakland for Christmas. You should have heard how glad my parents were that I didn't kill myself. They were even happier when they found out I'm not gay.

	Paul and Lacey are kind enough to share some leftover fungi to help calm my nerves. That, combined with yet another viewing of James Dean's performance is what gives me my final burst of inspiration.

As the END CREDITS of REBEL play behind them, Lacey fits a bombshell wig on Nick's head and finishes the last touches of make-up that make him... ...who we will come to know as CARLOTTA ULANSKY. Nick regards his female alter-ego in the mirror.

	<DIALOGUE>
	This is Tina Manion reporting live at Redwood High in Ukiah where local law enforcement as well as the FBI awaits the promised arrival of Nick Twisp.

ON THE VARIOUS FACES OF THE CROWD staring up in silence. Estelle, Wally, Vijay, Trent, Dwayne, George, Lacey, Paul... Nick gives a little wave as if he were a celebrity. The parking lot erupts with CHEERS of his name. A few Berkeley KIDS hold up a sign that reads I'M SINGLE, LET'S

<DIRECTION>
EXT. BLUFF OVER CLEAR LAKE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The BMW hurtles off the bluff and soars through the air, tires spinning, a plume of snow blowing off the hood. The car descends into a nose dive and flips completely upside- down, hitting the ice covered surface of Clear Lake with a thundering SMACK. Police cars swerve to a stop at the edge of the bluff and the crowd of officers and agents peer over the side at the hole in the ice.

	Make love to you I would think.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK_CARLOTTA>
<SHEENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then why don't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEENI>
<NICK_CARLOTTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pardon?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK_CARLOTTA>
<SHEENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take off that silly wig and make love to me!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Sheeni tugs off the wig and tosses it across the room.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sheeni! You knew!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<SHEENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course, Nick. Did you really expect to fool your soul mate with such a disguise?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Nick swoons, grasping her gauze-glazed nakedness.
</DIRECTION>
<SHEENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take me darling!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
And as they engage in a feverish kiss, ROUSING HYMNS surge. The church chorus' joyful song rings Hallelujah. The two lovers are entwined before an abstract RED
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACKGROUND.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LAS VEGAS OF THE BODY Into the NICK'S PENIS nightclub where champagne bottles POP with the ringing in of a new era, and the Leopards ROAR, and the stage erupts with fireworks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SHEENI'S ROOM - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick sleeps with a grin on his face. He rouses at the touch of Sheeni's lips on his cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<SHEENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My parents are at services. They won't be back for hours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEENI>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shall we have breakfast, my love?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<SHEENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What a lovely notion, darling. You go ahead downstairs and get things started.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Sheeni hauls herself out of bed and grabs the phone off the cradle.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<SHEENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Calling Taggarty to report that you are not completely incompetent in the bedroom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEENI>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do I get to stay and hear my grade?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<SHEENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not a chance, Mr. Twisp. Such things are reserved for girl talk only. And for good reason.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles at him and he smiles back.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very well, Sheeni. Don't be long.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SAUNDERS' MOBILE HOME - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick prances into the living room in his underwear. He starts to head into the kitchen when he catches sight of the full length mirror out of the corner of his eye. He stops in front of the mirror and flexes his biceps. Admires himself. François appears in the mirror behind Nick, Thompson slung over his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, good morning, François. What do you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<FRANÇOIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do I sink? I sink now's are chance to run for ze hills.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Nick lowers his arms and furrows his brow.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<FRANÇOIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nick, we are young, yes? Is the world not our oyster? Beaucoup des filles. Do you not want to know what it is like to make love to another girl?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANÇOIS>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do, but... We've come so far. What about Sheeni?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<FRANÇOIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forget Sheeni. Yes, she will always be ze first conquest, but all zis time you saught zis was ze end, ze one and only, when in fact it is only ze beginning.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Nick lifts his eyebrows with dawning epiphany. In the reflection we can see behind Nick as Albert leaps onto the love seat and barks at the sound of approaching sirens. Nick runs to the window just in time to see half a dozen law enforcement vehicles pull up.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sheeni, the police are here!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He ducks down from the window as a chopper buzzes overhead.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quick! Maybe I can sneak out the back!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<MEGAPHONE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	NICK TWISP! WE HAVE YOU SURROUNDED!
	</DIALOGUE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't understand. How do they even know I'm alive?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<SHEENI>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I called them of course.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Nick spins to face her. She's standing in the doorway and there's not a hint of wrong-doing in her face.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, thanks a pantsful!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<SHEENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But, Nickie, it had to be done.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEENI>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But... but why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<SHEENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't very well marry a wanted man, honey. Look at it this way, in a few months you'll be a free man and we can be together in Paris.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Nick looks to François in disbelief. But the Frenchman just rolls his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANÇOIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You might as well break it to her now, Nick.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A long pensive beat as Nick contemplates telling her he may never see her again. But behind Sheeni's air of control, Nick finally sees the vulnerability he's had in his hands all along.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	François is right of course, but on the other hand, why be cruel? After all, Sheeni had managed to give me hope every step of the way. And if hope is what Sheeni would now need to go on, well then...
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As always, you are right, my love.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Sheeni beams. François smacks his forehead with hand.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANÇOIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Merd.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The Frenchman in the mirror sticks the barrel of the Thompson in his mouth and blows himself OUT OF FRAME just as... ...the front door bursts open and the FBI AGENTS surround Nick.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SAUNDERS' MOBILE HOME - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The agents lead Nick to the caravan of law enforcement parked in the road.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Arrested? Ha. It may not appear so, but the truth is... I've got the world on a string.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Sheeni emerges from the home, Albert barking in protest. Nick strains against his cuffs to look over his shoulder at her.
</DIRECTION>
<SHEENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Write often, Nickie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEENI>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will, darling.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<SHEENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And don't worry about Albert. He'll be waiting for you too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEENI>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As François would remind me, I'm intelligent, healthy, virile, not violently ugly... On the whole I am splendidly equipped for this great adventure we call the human existence.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The FBI agents shove Nick into the back of their black Saturn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SATURN(MOVING) - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick watches out the back window as the car pulls away. A view of Sheeni waving in the road, Albert at her feet.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Besides, what jury would convict a teenager who acted out of love? And even if I do get to spend the next few months of my youth getting Dwayned by the inmates of the California Juvenile Correctional System, I did get my thirty two minutes of lovemaking with one of the most outstanding girls of this or any other epoch.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Nick turns to face the front while behind him the waving figure gets ever more distant. A pensive moment as he actually questions...
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But was it all worth it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Nick revisits those thirty two minutes in his mind and it brings a smirk to his face.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You bet your left nut it was.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
And as Tom Jones' SHE'S A LADY kicks in, we...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
