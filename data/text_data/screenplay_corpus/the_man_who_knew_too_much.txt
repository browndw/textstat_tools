The Arab hesitates for a moment, but the attitude of his head shows us that he has seen McKenna. He makes his way desperately and painfully toward him. He is finding it difficult to remain upright and even take those last few steps.

EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

A closer view of McKenna shows that those around him, including his wife and the Draytons, become frightened. He spreads his arms out to move them back protectively, waiting to see what is going to happen.

As the Arab reaches McKenna, the knife drops from his back, and he collapses at Ben's feet. Ben endeavors to grab him as he falls. He misses his shoulders, and his hands close in and inadvertently grab the Arab's cheeks.

With what strength he has, Louis drags Ben down until Ben's ear is near to his mouth. With a great effort Louis whispers to him.

A big closeup of Ben's ear and Louis' mouth enables us to hear the whispering, but Louis' voice is fading so much that we cannot distinguish the words -- at least enough to make any sense out of what he says.

The Arabs crowd in to see the details. Louis Bernard, the McKennas and the Draytons are in the center of a large flat cement section of the market place. The Police by now have caught up to the event, and dash quickly into the picture toward Ben and Louis. Instinctively Ben backs away, as do the Draytons, and Jo and Hank. However, Ben still stays closer than the rest. One of the police picks up the knife and examines it, another bends down to wipe the make-up off Louis Bernard's face. Ben looks around for his wife.

INT. SAVOY SUITE - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a suite at Savoy's Hotel we see the door open and Ben and Jo McKenna are ushered into the suite by the frock-coated desk clerk. Behind them are two assistant porters carrying their bags. In the foreground, through which we are SHOOTING, are three large baskets of assorted flowers. They are obviously gift of greeting to London. The porters move off into the bedroom with the bags. They lay out the bags, open the drapes and windows, etc. The desk clerk turns on the lights in the main room, as the McKennas look about.

The desk clerk goes out the door, carefully closing it. The McKenna are alone. Jo turns to look at the basket of flowers, and crosses TOWARD THE CAMERA to look at them. She takes a card in her hand, attached to the largest basket, reads the note.

Ben puts the room key down on a table, and the CAMERA PANS him over to a smaller desk containing the telephone and telephone books. He sits down at the desk, and reaches for the general telephone directory. He begins flipping through the pages. Jo turns from the flowers and walks over to him. He pauses, takes out of his pocket the black notebook on which he wrote Louis Bernard's message. He tears out the page, hands the notebook to Jo.

She heads for the door, and Ben sits there squirming with suspense, and annoyance at being interrupted. Beyond him, Jo opens the door, and immediately four people pour in. They are Val Parnall and his wife. Helen, intelligent, sophisticated, and full of life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The other two are Cindy Fontaine, an American music hall entertainer, now in England, around forty-five, more of a character actress than a lead -- and Jan Peterson, a musical comedy singer nearer Jo's age, smart-looking, but talkative and slightly scatterbrained. The women come in first, Helen Parnell throws her arms around Jo in affectionate greeting.

In a quiet street off Camden Town we see Ben, alight and pay off a London taxi. The taxi does a U-turn and disappears around a corner. Ben starts to walk TOWARD THE CAMERA. He glances at the piece of paper from, his pocket bearing Ambrose Chappell's address. He is completely alone in a deserted street -- so much so that his footsteps click on the pavement and create the feeling of an echo. As he walks he listens to the echo ind for a moment wonders if it is an echo. He slows up and comes to a stop close to the CAMERA. There is complete silence -- only the faint distant London traffic noises.

Ben glances down at the paper in his hand, and looks up trying to locate the right house number as he walks. The street has a mixture of houses, yards, an odd dirty- looking store or two.

They enter the Chapel from the rear, looking around cautiously. A hymn is in progress. The Chapel holds about three hundred people. It is of the non-conformist type and the congregation consists mostly of middle- aged and elderly women. Although the McKennas are not aware of it, we notice that the organist is none other than Edna, the woman who observed Jo at the airport, and later took care of Hank.

Carefully the McKennas find their way to a back row seat. One or two of the women in the back row turn to look at the new arrivals. Jo wants to whisper something to Ben, but with a gesture he silences her. Ben picks up hymnal, hands her one, finds the right page and begins to sing along with the hymn. But instead of following the words of the hymn, Ben makes up his own words to communicate with Jo, as he looks around at the chapel.

Jo looks toward Ben almost panicked. Suddenly Mrs. Drayton has reached the end of their row. She pushes forward her collection plate, and as she does so her face blanches.

	Few of us pause to think how life's adversities work in our behalf, to make better men and women of us. But I believe we should pause now to do a little stock-taking -- to look into our own hearts and see what we find there. Therefore instead of continuing the service, I think we should all return to our homes for private meditation, remembering how little we have to complain of and how much to be grateful for. Next week I shall discuss the fruits of our meditation. Until then, my blessing upon each and every one of you.

Shooting through the Albert Memorial as a foreground piece we see the activities of the arrivals at a big concert. Through the archway large limousines are pulling up, while on the sidewalk level with the main road odd taxis are pulling in. We see the usual line of posters which run along the edge of the sidewalk.

<DIRECTION>
The screen is filled with a large poster. It announces for that evening the commemorative concert. Further details on the poster indicate that a Cantata will be sung featuring the London Symphony Orchestra, The Royal Choral Society, and a name woman as featured mezzo soprano, and Conductor Bernard Herrmann. Between the CAMERA and the Poster a taxi pulls up. It is near enough to the CAMERA so that just the driver and the door fills the screen, Jo McKenna steps out the far side and pays off the driver with a Ten Shilling Note. She hurries away. The driver endeavors to call after her as he turns the note around in his hand. He looks at it with satisfaction, and stuffs it into the inner recesses of his clothes.

Jo patiently awaits her turns as two or three people, perhaps a couple of Chelsea 'long-hairs', and one other people, who obviously have not reserved ahead of time because they had no money, take their turns at the window. A uniformed attendant, standing beside this queue, is repeating information for the benefit of the queue.

The constable doesn't quite know what to make of Ben's dramatic plea. He indicates that he must talk to his superior. Ben waits impatiently as the constable goes over to one of the Inspectors who is standing in a small group a little way off. From his viewpoint we see the constable addressing the Inspector with skeptical nods of his head in Ben's direction.

A closer view of Ben shows him trying another door cautiously and surreptitiously. He looks in and then softly closes the door. He moves further along and tries another door with the same cautious movement.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see Ben hurrying down the stairs. Jo rushes into the lobby and, seeing Ben, dashes towards him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A few of the people around the lobby begin to look at Jo and Ben. We see the Assistant Manager hurry over to them. They are in a group of three, and although we do not actually hear what he says, due to the hubbub, he is obviously questioning Ben and being solicitous to Jo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOBBY - (NIGHT) - SEMI-CLOSEUP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We go close just in time to catch the tail-end of the conversation. Ben is just saying:
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then he didn't kill him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<ASSISTANT_MANAGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your wife saved him -- it is only a small flesh wound...Oh here he is now...you must come and meet him...don't be nervous...I'll get the aide to present you...it will be all right
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(To Woburn)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you present the lady to the prime minister?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASSISTANT_MANAGER>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly their attention is drawn to something off- screen up the stairs. The hubbub increases.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOBBY - (NIGHT) - SEMI-LONG SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From their viewpoint we see the Prime Minister, obviously not wounded sufficiently to incapacitate, being escorted down the stairs by his Aide and other members of the staff, including Woburn of the Special Branch. The Prime Minister is indicating his arm and obviously by the way he waves his hands, is deprecating their concern about his wound. In fact he is rather over-doing it. Just beyond them at the top of the stairs we see 'Buchanan' standing with the Ambassador.
</DIRECTION>

'Buchanan' is reassuring the Ambassador.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The manager is leading Ben and Jo across to the foot of the stairs. They are reluctant but he insists. As the CAMERA PANS them over they meet the group at the bottom at the stairs. The manager calls out to Mr. Woburn and indicates Ben and Jo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOBBY STAIRS - (NIGHT) - CLOSEUP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Woburn is a little non-plussed. He leans over to one of the Prime Minister's Aides. The latter's face lights up. He leans over and whispers something to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is all smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOBBY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Woburn steps down and introduces Ben and Jo to the Prime Minister's Aide.
</DIRECTION>
<WOBURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Prime Minister, this is the lady who --
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOBURN>
<DIRECTION>
The Prime Minister interrupts enthusiastically.
</DIRECTION>
<PRIME_MINISTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My dear lady, I shall be for ever in your debt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRIME_MINISTER>
<WOBURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And this is her husband --
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOBURN>
<DIRECTION>
The Prime Minister interrupts again, less enthusiastically.
</DIRECTION>
<PRIME_MINISTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A pleasure, my dear sir...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(He turns to Jo)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I trust you will permit me to wait upon you tomorrow and to express the depth of my gratitude.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRIME_MINISTER>
<JO>

	<DIALOGUE>
	It wasn't -- it wasn't --

<PRIME_MINISTER>
<DIRECTION>
(Gallantly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh but it was, my dear lady.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRIME_MINISTER>
<DIRECTION>
There is an awkward pause. The Prime Minister collects himself and turns to move on out of the hall, the police making a passageway for him through the crowd. We see the Ambassador hurrying into the picture and moving across the screen quickly to follow the Prime Minister.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOBBY - (NIGHT) - SEMI-CLOSEUP

Ben and Jo stand for a moment not knowing what to do or where to go next. Woburn standing with Ben and Jo. They look up and see Buchanan.

When they reach him they have only one thought in their minds to ask him.

	Where's our boy? Where's Hank?
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can talk if you'll come in here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUCHANAN>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA PANS the three across the top landing and to the doors of the 'Green Room' There are various police standing about and some of Special Branch men can be seen inside the room. 'Buchanan' steps aside too allow Jo to enter. Then he and Ben follow her in. The door closes behind them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GREEN ROOM - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The three of them enter the 'Green Room', generally used by the principal Artistes appearing at Royal Albert Hall. Buchanan nods to two Special Branch men who are standing about in case they are needed. The room is informal containing arm chairs, a sofa and a number of small tables. Jo sits down wearily into the nearest chair. Ben remains standing, Buchanan takes a seat in a chair near a telephone, he looks up at Ben as if he expects him to say something. Ben responds to the look.
</DIRECTION>
<BUCHANAN>
<DIRECTION>
(Coldly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you both know the time and place all along.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUCHANAN>
<BEN>
<DIRECTION>
(Roughly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be a fool.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<BUCHANAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	An odd coincidence -- both of you turning up here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUCHANAN>
<BEN>
<DIRECTION>
(Coldly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too bad you didn't contact your assistant. He sent us both here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<BUCHANAN>
<DIRECTION>
(Quickly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I beg your pardon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUCHANAN>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see, we finally needed that help you offered. We still need it.

<JO>

(Urgently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Mr. Buchanan. We still need it.

The door opens and another member of the Special Branch enters.
</DIRECTION>
<DETECTIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE>
<DIRECTION>
Buchanan nods to him to speak.
</DIRECTION>
<DETECTIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've questioned the woman. Said she bought a ticket that happened to place her in the same box with the man that did the shooting. Doesn't know anything -- but if she does, she's not talking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE>
<BUCHANAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll see her later.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUCHANAN>
<DETECTIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very good, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>

	Please tell me everything, now. Everything.

INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MED. SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A high CAMERA shows us a large hallway and ornate ballroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As yet the room is about quarter filled and various guests of the Diplomatic Corps and others are gradually adding to the group. The CAMERA DOLLIES DOWN over them until it reaches slightly open doorway. Peering cautiously through we see the face of Drayton.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>

On the other side of the doorway is Drayton and his wife. She is pacing nervously behind him. A footman comes up to them and announces:
</DIRECTION>
<FOOTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His Excellency will see you now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOOTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Drayton motions to his wife and the CAMERA PANS them after the footman across a small hallway. He is the very same footman we saw among the group of servants who were herded out of the kitchen. He opens a door in front of the Draytons -- they enter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MED. CLOSE SHOT
</DIRECTION>

Standing in front of a fireplace, above which is an oil painting of the Prime Minister, is the Ambassador whom we saw at the Albert Hall. He is on the telephone.

<AMBASSADOR>

	Yes...yes...I see. Well if the woman won't talk, she won't talk and that's that, I suppose. All right.

Mrs. Drayton closes the door behind the two as Drayton advances towards the Ambassador with an easy manner, the CAMERA PANNING him.
</DIRECTION>
<DRAYTON>
<DIRECTION>
(Easily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me sir, I have a lot to explain to you -- something very unusual has happened. I must also have the money to pay our French marksman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRAYTON>
<AMBASSADOR>
<DIRECTION>
(Almost casually)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wouldn't it be superfluous, considering that he's dead?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMBASSADOR>
<DIRECTION>
Drayton and his wife stare mutely at the Ambassador. They are staggered at this news.
</DIRECTION>
<AMBASSADOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His aim wasn't quite as good as you led me to expect. The target merely received a slight flesh wound in the arm. Worse than useless.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMBASSADOR>
<DIRECTION>
Drayton still stares, petrified, at the Ambassador.
</DIRECTION>
<AMBASSADOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then your French friend panicked, and made a fatal crash -- landing on the floor of the Albert Hall.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMBASSADOR>
<DRAYTON>
<DIRECTION>
(Blustering weakly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't see how you can hold me responsible. He was most warmly recommended by our people in Marrakesh...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRAYTON>
<DIRECTION>
The Ambassador now begins to get really nasty.
</DIRECTION>
<AMBASSADOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm glad you're able to treat the matter so lightly. I am holding a reception here this evening. In a few minutes, I have to welcome our Prime Minister as my guest of honor -- when I hope and expected that he would be totally unable to attend. That amuses you, no doubt?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMBASSADOR>
<DRAYTON>
<DIRECTION>
(Feebly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know what to say ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRAYTON>
<AMBASSADOR>
<DIRECTION>
(Brutally)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. But I do. You've muddled everything from the start. Kidnapping that child in Marrakesh...Don't you realize that Americans dislike having their children kidnapped?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMBASSADOR>
<DRAYTON>
<DIRECTION>
(Trying to keep his end up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How else could I make sure the American would hold his tongue?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRAYTON>
<AMBASSADOR>
<DIRECTION>
(Ignoring this)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And then, to crown it all, you get cold feet and come running along here to hide -- and bring the child with you: Don't you see what you've done to the diplomatic status of this Embassy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMBASSADOR>
<DRAYTON>
<DIRECTION>
(Weakly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't think...I only thought...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRAYTON>
<AMBASSADOR>
<DIRECTION>
(Staccato)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How are you going to get the child out of here, eh? Eh? Eh? Eh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMBASSADOR>
<DRAYTON>
<DIRECTION>
(Struggling for self-confidence)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's no difficulty about that, surely? The car --
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRAYTON>
<AMBASSADOR>
<DIRECTION>
(Interrupting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With plain-clothes detectives planted right round this building?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Wryly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You English intellectuals will be the death of us all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMBASSADOR>
<DRAYTON>
<DIRECTION>
(Desperate)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll think of some method. Just give me time....
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRAYTON>
<AMBASSADOR>
<DIRECTION>
(He snorts Contemptuously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Time!
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMBASSADOR>
<DIRECTION>
The Ambassador paces a moment, suppressing his rage, and then he stops and looks at Drayton as if thinking about something.
</DIRECTION>
<AMBASSADOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want the child removed from this Embassy, and removed in such a way that he won't be able to say any more where he has been tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMBASSADOR>
<MRS_DRAYTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, no!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_DRAYTON>
<DIRECTION>
The Ambassador pauses and looks up at her in such a manner that she almost shrinks. She tries to say something, but no words come out of her half-open mouth. Drayton, however, answers the Ambassador with horrible servility.
</DIRECTION>
<DRAYTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right, I'll see to it..
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRAYTON>
<DIRECTION>
Lucy Drayton looks at her husband with loathing. There is a polite tap on the door. The Ambassador looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<AMBASSADOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMBASSADOR>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens and a butler enters.
</DIRECTION>
<BUTLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your Excellency, the Princess should be arriving at any moment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTLER>
<DIRECTION>
The Ambassador braces himself, his chest swells out a little, h assumes a set smile and strides from the room. Just at this moment we hear a String Orchestra in the distance strike up some gay waltz music. The Ambassador goes out of the door. Mrs. Drayton is looking down at the floor.

At this moment the phone rings. Woburn, who is now re- placing the two Special Branch men in the room, picks up the telephone.

	Right. Bye.

Included in the group is the Personal Aide of the Prime Minister. He sees Jo and Ben enter, hurries over to them, smiling and eager. The piece that the string quartet is playing ends amid a round of polite applause. There are people rising from their chairs and a general movement out into the hallway.

Having strummed a few notes, Jo settles down and plays the introduction to her song. We see the great tenseness on her face, interposed with Professional smiles, which she bestows on those nearest her, but always the tenseness returns. As she sings, her voice seem to be rather overpowering. It fills the whole room with quite a volume. It almost seems out of place that she has become so professional in such an intimate drawing room setting.
