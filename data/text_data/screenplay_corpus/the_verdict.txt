INT. GALVIN'S OFFICE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The seedy, disorganized small office, Galvin in shirt-sleeves opening a file cabinet. He takes out an armload of files, carries them to a wastebasket and throws them in. He sits on his desk, as if exhausted by his effort, pours from a whiskey bottle into a large water glass, downs the glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He has been drinking for some time. He starts stumbling back to the file cabinet. On the way his eye is caught by his degrees hanging on the wall. He stumbles to them, picks them up and walks over to the wastebasket and throws them in. He goes back to the file cabinet, the phone starts ringing. Galvin lets it ring, continues emptying the files into the wastebasket, tearing some of them up as he does so.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He repeats softly to himself, as a litany, "It doesn't make a bit of difference, it doesn't make a bit of difference..." He starts back to the desk for the bottle, knocks the still- ringing phone off the desk. He pours himself a drink.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he downs it we hear -- softly -- from the phone on the floor: a MAN'S VOICE. "Frank. Frank. Frank. Goddamnit. Are you there...? Frank..." Galvin pays no attention.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Drinks his drink and gazes at the wall -- now empty of degrees.

You think it's going to be different next month? It's going to be the same. And I have to stop. This is it. I got you a good case, it's a moneymaker. You do it right and it will take care of you.

INT. NURSING HOME WARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door to the ward from the inside. Galvin opening the door to the dark ward, backlit, tentative, a little unsteadied from his drinking. He puts his back against the door, puts down file and briefcase, extracts a small cheap Polaroid camera from the briefcase, readies it to shoot, picks up his paraphernalia, and starts off down the ward. As he walks down the ward he checks the file hung at the foot of each bed. Galvin stops at the foot of one bed and reads the chart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - P.O.V.

	It's a question of continuing values. St. Catherine's -- to do the good that she must do in the community has to maintain the position that she holds in the community.

A young ATTORNEY in shirt-sleeves and vest racing through a huge, ultra-modern, ultra-successful legal office. The office is near empty. A couple of secretaries are at their desks, a couple of lawyers in their cubicles. The CAMERA FOLLOWS the Attorney tearing through the corridors of the office, up a spiral staircase, through yet more office space, into:

INT. CONCANNON CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

...a conference room. Mahogany, tinted glass, a panoramic view of Boston. Twenty-five attorneys, male and female, mostly young, gaze at the young Attorney as he enters the room. He stops running. He approaches the front of the room tentatively. Standing at the blackboard in front of the conference room is EDWARD CONCANNON. Senior partner of the firm, late fifties, imposing, he radiates success. As the young Attorney approaches Concannon he is stopped with a gesture. Concannon addresses the room.

Concannon takes a piece and writes on the blackboard "Jan. 12th." He underlines it heavily.

<CONCANNON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our court date is January twelfth. You're all acquainted with this case. It's been scheduled for eighteen months. We have the attorney for the Plaintiff, Frank Galvin -- and I trust you are all familiar with his record -- and we have been expecting him to call us to negotiate. As he did not, and five days before we're supposed to go to court we made him a rather generous offer, which he refused. Five days before the trial. What does this mean? I want to find out.

	Our clients are: the Archdiocese of Boston; St. Catherine Laboure Hospital, and Drs. Marx and Towler, two of the most respected men in their profession. The thrust of this defense will be to answer in court, in the press and in the public mind -- to answer the accusation of negligence this completely: not only that we win the case, but that we win the case so that it's seen that the attack on these men and this institution was a rank obscenity.

	In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?

</GALVIN>
<DR_THOMPSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cardiac arrest. During delivery her heart stopped. When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen. You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_THOMPSON>
<GALVIN>

	Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes. In your opinion is his estimate correct?

Dead, resigned. He closes the phone book. He reaches in a pack of cigarettes on the desk. It is empty. He roots in the ashtray for a long butt. This disgusts him. He rejects it. Rubs his eyes. Gets up. Goes to the window, stares out. Looks back at the scene in his office. It is over.

He stands by Laura and looks down at her, he looks at Mickey.
</DIRECTION>
