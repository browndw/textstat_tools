:SC: JAWS: THE REVENGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TITLE SEQUENCE: UNDER WATER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As titles and music play, we move slowly beneath the water off the coast of Amity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We swim beneath a dock, threading our way through pilings...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We move through the water, swimming, just swimming, with all the time in the world.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We move over some junk -- the rusting front end of an automobile... We're going somewhere...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The water becomes shallow and we stop. Up through the surface, the images distorted, we see the lights of a town...Amity...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We move on, swimming again, just swimming, moving through the water until, suddenly, the water swirls with motion around us. We experience the sensation of turning and then we see it, THE EYE...And, for a moment, we think we're going to see more...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But all we see, as titles end, is THE EYE...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAWS: THE REVENGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE IN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AN ENORMOUS BLACK EYE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
casts its deadly stare straight at us. Waves of heat, like ocean currents, rise up around it. A sound like that of the fires of hell fills our ears.

A hand is heard being slapped lightly.

	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
The huge eye rises up toward us, then turns away and disappears, to be replaced by another just like it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BRODY HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The eye belongs to a fish and the fish is frying in a pan and Ellen has just turned it. She glances at Sean, her son, who's dressed in an Amity police uniform. He's munching a piece of lettuce from the salad, which he's been picking at. It's winter and she's wearing a bit of wool.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're almost as fast as your father. He could snatch a tomato out of a salad faster that a rabbit makes love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
Sean grins at his mother and slowly tries to take more lettuce without being seen.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see what you're doing....

</SEAN>
<ELLEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me finish dinner before you eat it...Chop the peppers....
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
He lines up a red and green pepper and eyes them sympatha- tically.
</DIRECTION>
<SEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry fellas....
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEAN>
<DIRECTION>
He starts chopping them up and Ellen grabs her glass of wine and sits herself on a stool to watch him. Showing off a little, he starts adding some professional panache to his chopping.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watch your fingers....
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
He cuts himself.
</DIRECTION>
<SEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>

The phone rings.

</ELLEN>
<SEAN>

He sucks at his finger as she answers the phone on its second ring.

Sean, still sucking at his finger, eager to talk with his niece, moves to the phone and leans in close to the mouthpiece.
</DIRECTION>
<SEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi ya, kiddo. How you doing down there in the sunshine?

Ellen shares the mouthpiece with her son.

Sean makes a face at his mother, who smiles at him, then continues her conversation with Thea.

<ELLEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you get the book I sent you?

Sean studies the fish as it fries in the pan, not sure what to do with it.

AMITY - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's the next day and the main business street of Amity is ablaze with Christmas lights and decorations. The streets are busier than usual with traffic. People move about with that extra sense of purpose and good cheer which accompanies the holiday season.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sean, Ellen and Tiffany, the young woman to whom Sean is engaged, are just leaving Ellen's real estate office, a storefront on the main street. They're carrying Christmas packages. Ellen's partner, Agnes Taft, is seen at her desk inside.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
(as she leaves)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tomorrow we have to get the ads for the paper straightened out. And if Mrs. Blodget calls, tell her we'll have the final offer tomorrow....

Mrs. Taft grins and goes back to work as Ellen, Sean and Tiffany start across the street. The sign above the door behind them reads: 'BRODY AND TAFT, REAL ESTATE.'

They approach the front of the police station.
</DIRECTION>
<SEAN>

INT. POLICE STATION - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sean moves into the front office, taking off his gloves and blowing into his hands. The secretary, Polly, who is close to retirement, is going through a filing cabinet. There's a framed picture of Martin Brody on the wall near her. It has a plaque beneath it which reads, MARTIN BRODY, POLICE CHIEF, 1973-1985. She slams the drawer shut in her frustration at not being able to find what she's looking for.
</DIRECTION>
<SEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That bad, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEAN>
<POLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're out of decaf...We're out of petty cash...And we're out of requisition forms....

He smiles sympathetically and pours himself a half cup of coffee and waits for the rest of it.

	<DIALOGUE>
	You have the safety talk at school, one o'clock tomorrow....
	</DIALOGUE>
</POLLY>
<SEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anything to do before I go home?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEAN>
<DIRECTION>
He sips at his coffee, eager to be gone. Polly opens another file and searches.
</DIRECTION>
<POLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That man keeps calling about his training film. I can't convince him we don't have a S.W.A.T. team.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POLLY>
<SEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good night, Polly....
	</DIALOGUE>

He takes a final sip of coffee and puts the mug down and heads for the door. The phone rings. Polly moves to her desk.

<POLLY>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold it! There's an old dock piling drifting in the channel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POLLY>
<DIRECTION>
Sean reappears in the doorway looking quizzical.
</DIRECTION>
<POLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing; on the phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe it will just keep drifting until it goes away.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Sean)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's stuck against a channel marker.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POLLY>

He starts away again, trying to ignore it.

THE DOCKS - DUSK TO NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A huge banner is stretched above the docks. It reads: AMITY ANNUAL CHRISTMAS PAGEANT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The combined forces of the high school band, chorus and dramatic society are in the process of rehearsing their musical version of the birth of Christ. Their director, Mr. Tarkanian, is jumping about, trying to organize things.
</DIRECTION>
<TARKANIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on people. Come on. We go on at eight o'clock tomorrow night and...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(voice rising to a scream)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No one's ready....
	</DIALOGUE>
</TARKANIAN>
<DIRECTION>
This gets him some attention and his kids begin taking their places -- Mary and Joseph, the Three Wisemen, the shepherds...the sheep, the camel, which is a horse with an artificial hump.
</DIRECTION>
<TARKANIAN>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You shepherds, find your places. And don't forget the sheep....
	</DIALOGUE>
</TARKANIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Sean pulls up in the police vehicle, gets out and, grinning and shaking his head at the confusion, begins to make his way through it.
</DIRECTION>
<SEAN>
<DIRECTION>
(yelling at Tarkanian)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good luck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEAN>
<TARKANIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll need it with this bunch....
	</DIALOGUE>
</TARKANIAN>

Sean pushes on, moving out on the dock.
</DIRECTION>
<TARKANIAN>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's the Frankincense? This is supposed to be a dress rehearsal....
	</DIALOGUE>
</TARKANIAN>
<DIRECTION>
THE POLICE BOAT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sean gets the engine started and casts off and the small boat makes its way from the dock.
</DIRECTION>
<TARKANIAN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) (shouting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're supposed to be in costume, Joseph. Where's your robe? Jesus!

	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</A_KID>
<DIRECTION>
THE BAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boat moves slowly toward the channel. Sean looks back and sees the lights and activity on the dock and smiles a little, then turns his attention to the job at hand, switching on the boat's spotlight, using it to cut through the accumulating darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CHANNEL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sean brings the boat to the channel marker, with its small blinking red light, and kills the engine and examines the huge piece of dock piling, most of which is beneath the sur- face. It's lodged against the marker, so heavy in the water that it's not moving an inch. Hardly more than a shadow, his face just barely illuminated by the occasional dull red light, Sean gathers the towline and begins trying to secure it to the piling, a difficult job in the cold, which requires him to lean out over the side as far as he can.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The band is heard starting up on the dock, gradually col- lecting itself until it sounds like one, playing "The First Noel." A few moments later, the choir begins singing it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the water explodes up around him violently and the boat rocks in the shock of it and a dark form is seen, for an instant, and Sean disappears from our view. The boat's spotlight rocks crazily. Then the turmoil of the water dies and all is calm and the singing from the dock is heard clearly again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sean, holding onto his shredded sleeve and coat, bleeding profusely, has fallen to a corner of the stern. He looks off toward the dock and opens his mouth to call for help, but nothing comes out. The music grows louder as the band and chorus find their confidence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then a tremendous surge of water explodes upward and the dark form is seen again, for an instant, and our view of Sean is lost. When we can see again, Sean and a corner of the stern are gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment, Sean is seen holding onto the piece of dock piling with his remaining arm. He cries out for help but it's lost in the swelling sound of the Christmas Carol coming from the dock. Then Sean and the pole disappear beneath the surface. He's just gone. A few moments later, the pole pops back to the surface. In the rocking spotlight from the boat, the clear outline of the shark's jaws can be seen where it's taken a chunk of it. In the stillness of the night, the band and chorus suddenly stop.
</DIRECTION>
<TARKANIAN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) (yelling; his

INT. POLICE STATION - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ellen in shock, moves down a corridor with Lenny, Sean's boss, the Chief. He holds her arm as they move to a back room of the station. Polly and a handful of townspeople watch sadly from the other end.
</DIRECTION>
<LENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I didn't have to, I wouldn't.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's not enough...Law requires a positive identification and there's not...

<DIRECTION>
(can't finish)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He holds the door open and Ellen goes inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BACK ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sheet covers the table in the center of the room. There's a slight bulge beneath it. Ellen moves to the table. Lenny moves to get ahead of her.
</DIRECTION>
<LENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wish there was some way to make it easy....
	</DIALOGUE>
</LENNY>
<DIRECTION>
Ellen, still in shock, watches as Lenny pulls back the sheet. She goes rigid, staring at Sean's remains without expression. He glances at her, then puts the sheet back. She doesn't move. He moves to an old desk which sits in a corner and takes up a package. Sean's service revolver, in his holster, and his badge are on top of it. He brings them to her.
</DIRECTION>
<LENNY>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His things....
	</DIALOGUE>
</LENNY>
<DIRECTION>
She looks dully at Lenny, then at the package, staring at the service revolver.
</DIRECTION>
<LENNY>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you'd want them....
	</DIALOGUE>
</LENNY>

She takes what he offers and leaves.

Ellen stops and uses all her strength to compose herself. Her expression is etched with controlled rage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BRODY HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A taxi pulls up in front and Michael Brody, in his late twenties. Carla, his wife, mid-twenties, and Thea, their five-year-old daughter, get out. As the driver gathers their luggage, they look sadly at the house, then start for it. Thea doesn't really understand what's going on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael and his family move into the house.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>

There's no answer and he looks in the living room. It's empty.

	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>

Polly moves into the hall, followed by Mrs. Kintner, Agnes Taft, and another woman. They all look as though they've been working in the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<POLLY>

He moves to her and they embrace. Polly looks at Carla and the two women exchange sad smiles.

THE BEACH - DAY

Ellen stands at the shoreline, looking out toward the bay, her expression empty of feeling; stoic suppression of her feelings. Michael moves down the beach toward her.

<MICHAEL>

	Mom....

</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
She turns and, for a long moment they look at each other, then he moves to her and takes her in his arms. They hold onto each other for a long time. Tears begin to well up in his eyes. She looks at him, then kisses him gently, then looks back out at the water.

They walk on in silence for a moment and we see them coming toward us. Michael is deeply troubled. Carla is concerned about him.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God, he could make me laugh sometimes.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pauses)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was always tagging after me when we were kids. He wanted so much to do what I was doing....

Suddenly Michael starts running. Carla watches him for a moment, then starts running after him.
</DIRECTION>
<CARLA>

	Where are you going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nowhere....

</MICHAEL>

He starts running flat out and Carla runs with him, stopping finally because he's too fast and she can't keep pace. She watches as he works every muscle in his body, trying to exhaust himself, trying to rid himself of what he feels.

AVRIL BAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The water laps gently against the shore. A person's legs are seen walking into it. Ellen is revealed walking slowly, deliberate out into the cold water of the bay. Her expression is set with sad determination as though she's going to keep on walking, until the water swallows her up. Finally she stops, and slowly raises her right hand. It holds Sean's service revolver. She points it toward the water in front of her and one by one, coldly, methodically, fires all six rounds into the bay.

AVRIL BAY - DAY

From the surface of the water, the ferry is seen becoming smaller and smaller as it moves away. The old dock piling that Sean tried to dislodge from the channel marker, that cost him his life, has washed up on the beach.

Ellen looks at several small, rundown houses with Christmas decorations.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Romeo, who's been eyeing Ellen in his rearview mirror, picks up his "tour guide" microphone and lowers the stereo player and starts singing, doing a perfect imitation of Nat King Cole, singing the same song. Michael and Carla grin and Thea pulls herself forward to watch. Ellen catches on and laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Romeo does Tony Bennet and Johnny Mathis too. But they all sound like Nat King Cole....

MICHAEL'S HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Cadillac makes its way to a house like the others and stops. A Jeep is parked in the drive. An outbuilding, Carla's studio, is nearby. A small dock is in front. Despite its condition, the house is charming and is situated right on the beach. Romeo is still singing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The family piles out. Thea heads for the dock.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll help you with the bags, Romeo....

</CARLA>
<MICHAEL>

	It sure is....
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
Romeo hums as he and Michael start unloading luggage. Carla checks the backseat. Ellen stretches and looks at the house, trying to hide her mother's concern about the way her son is living. Carla sees her and smiles and puts her arm around her.
</DIRECTION>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It'll grow on you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<ELLEN>
	<DIALOGUE>

Ellen turns and sees Thea just grabbing an old automobile tire which is suspended by a rope from a beam on the dock.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
Thea swings out over the water and Ellen runs toward her. Carla and Michael follow.

Thea swings back to the dock and lets go of the tire, looking from her mother to her grandmother, not sure what she's supposed to do.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLEN>

	Not today. Come on, Thea....
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<DIRECTION>
She moves to her daughter to pick her up and Thea balks. Her exhaustion from the trip is too much. She starts to cry.
</DIRECTION>
<THEA>

Thea grabs the tire and Carla grabs her and Thea starts screaming through her tears.
</DIRECTION>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can swing later. We have to unpack now....
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>

Thea struggles in Carla's arms as they start for the house.

Thea is heard crying as Carla takes her into the house and they move on to the studio.

INT. STUDIO - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An enormous abstract metal sculpture sits center room. It has a huge gaping crevice near its top, not unlike a mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) (as they approach)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All you all right?

</MICHAEL>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We haven't had a real talk, have we? We'll do that before I go.

He nods. She studies his concern.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be all right, Michael.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(finding his smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. So will I....
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
They look at each other for a moment, then his gaze shifts to the piece of sculpture.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) (yelling from the house)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We forgot to stop at the store.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<DIRECTION>
Ellen studies the piece of sculpture. The studio is filled with other metal pieces and Carla's tools, which include tanks of gas and welder's gear. Ellen doesn't quite know what to make of it.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(yelling back)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

She looks at him, not quite sure what to say.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Incredible, isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
His grin is contagious and she smiles and they start out together.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The huge abstract sculpture, with its gaping crevice of a mouth, fills our vision.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE WATER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ellen swims off the beach by Michael's house. She is the only person in sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BENEATH THE WATER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ellen is seen from the point of view of something watching her, stalking her, as she swims. We move closer until we're beneath her. She stops swimming and treads water. We move closer and closer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ellen sees what's coming toward her and her expression floods with terror. She starts swimming as fast as she can. The water becomes violent as she's attacked. She struggles and the water begins to fill with blood. Her blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THEA'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ellen's eyes pop open, wide. Her face is still filled with fear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BENEATH THE WATER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the point of view of someone, something, we move slowly through the water, exploring the seascape, which is filled with exotic plants and fish and, nearby, the old wreck of a rusting freighter.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) (through a
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	small underwater speaker; an
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
unhappy voice)

	Stop farting around....

</JAKE>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>

<JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Try the area around the wreck....
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
A small wet submersible comes into view, working its way slowly over the flat sea bottom. Michael, in wet suit and scuba gear is inside. He's spotted a group of conch and parks the sub.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bingo....
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
He lifts the bubble and leans out and starts checking the conch to separate males from females. A single conch is seen shooting out the appendage which it uses to move, sinking it into the sea bottom and pulling itself forward.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How many...?

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
Michael starts putting small round electronic tags on the conch, which he secures with epoxy.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're being paid to see where they go...How they propagate....
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<JAKE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	If we had some decent money, I'd be able to read their temperatures... Study their motor systems....

</JAKE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you'd leave me alone, I'd be able to get my work done....
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
Michael swims free of the sub, to get free from the range of the speaker which carries Jake's voice.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Once a grunt, always a grunt. You got no vision, Michael. I'm getting a signal from the first one. You tag it right? It's buzzing. Sounds like a hornet trying to get out of a closet....
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
Michael ignores him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BARGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jake, an Islander, black, is listening to his headset. He's agitated. Clarence and William, the surface crew, both Islanders, watch Jake carefully. The barge is low in the water and broad of beam and is permanently moored to this site. A dinghy, with an outboard, is tied to the barge.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
(through the phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Michael!

BENEATH THE WATER - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Michael continues to tag conch.

<JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Michael...I know you can hear me....

</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
Michael looks toward the sub and the sound of Jake's voice, then continues his work.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STUDIO - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A flame, almost too bright to look at, welds metal to metal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carla works on her sculpture, adding yet another appendage to its trunk. She looks off a something, then lowers the flame of the torch and lifts her mask and studies what she sees, her expression reflecting both a sadness and understanding.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From her point of view, Ellen is seen washing windows outside the house. Her back is to Carla.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carla watches Ellen for a long moment, a sad smile finally working the corners of her mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was afraid to ask if you did windows....
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<DIRECTION>
Ellen turns and sees Carla and, for just a moment, is troubled at being caught. Then she offers a smile and a shrug.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't usually...Not at these rates.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
Ellen, her hair tied back, her expression showing fatigue, and Carla, looking more like an auto-body worker than an artist, look at each other, neither sure what to say next.
</DIRECTION>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could use a half-dozen more arms ...I've only got two weeks to get this thing finished....
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<ELLEN>

	Do you and Michael ever talk about his work...? About spending so much time working in the water?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Usually it's all he talks about...You mustn't worry....

<ELLEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't help it....

</ELLEN>
<CARLA>

The two women look at each other for another moment, then Ellen goes back to work. Carla watches her, then flips down her mask and turns the flame back up and returns to her welding.

INT. HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Christmas tree, a shiny green fake job, glitters with decorations. Thea is opening the last of her presents. Ellen, Michael and Carla, who's been playing Santa Claus, Jake and Louisa, a very attractive Islander, black, in her midtwenties, sit on the floor. They've all got drinks, and they're all into Thea.

INT. PLANE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hoagie and Ellen are side by side in a private aircraft.
</DIRECTION>
<HOAGIE>
<DIRECTION>
(in the midst of it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was struck by lightning, this man, seven times. Took his toenail, his shoe, his hat...set his hair on fire. But it didn't kill him. No one could explain that....
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOAGIE>
<DIRECTION>
She glances at him, amused by his efforts to entertain her.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How can you just take the plane like this?

</ELLEN>
<HOAGIE>

<HOAGIE>

</HOAGIE>
<DIRECTION>
He lets go of the wheel and the plane starts to lose altitude.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN>
<HOAGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you don't take it, we'll be swimming in a minute.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOAGIE>
<DIRECTION>
She hesitates, then grabs the wheel in front of her and he puts a hand on one of hers and guides the wheel back so the plane levels off. She's gripping the wheel so tightly her knuckles are turning white.
</DIRECTION>
<HOAGIE>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Easy does it. Hold her gently. She'll damn near fly herself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOAGIE>

She tries to relax, and after a few moments, he takes his hand off hers. She tenses.
</DIRECTION>
<HOAGIE>
<DIRECTION>

Ellen stares straight ahead, trying to get the feel of it.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLEN>

</ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
He answers with a mischievous grin.

<ELLEN>

</HOAGIE>
<ELLEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The plane's turning....
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
The plane is indeed starting to slip into a gentle banking turn. It's Hoagie's doing. He's nudging his wheel slightly.
</DIRECTION>
<HOAGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In the hut, sitting on a pole was a shrunken head. My head. Me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOAGIE>
<DIRECTION>
She glances at him, then looks ahead, not sure whether she's should be nervous about the plane's behavior.
</DIRECTION>
<HOAGIE>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was like looking into one of those mirrors which says, objects may be closer than they appear. Chief said, there are two of everybody in the world and since we already have one of you, the other one can go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOAGIE>
<DIRECTION>
Ellen laughs. Hoagie grins.
</DIRECTION>
<HOAGIE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</HOAGIE>
<ELLEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's wonderful....
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
She eases the plane into more of a turn and enjoys the sensation. She glances at him and he nods that she's doing just fine.
</DIRECTION>
<HOAGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are crazy, Ellen. No matter what anyone says....
	</DIALOGUE>

AN ISLAND - NATIVE QUARTER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A native festival, a parade filled with masked and costumed dancers and musicians and marchers, blasts its way through the ancient, narrow streets of an early Bahamian settlement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hoagie, wearing a windbreaker, and Ellen, who's changed her clothes, thread their way through the throng, moving like Salmon upstream against the flow of the mass of humanity moving the other way. She's fascinated by the music and noise and color of what's around her.
</DIRECTION>
<HOAGIE>
<DIRECTION>
(yelling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A few more streets....
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOAGIE>
<DIRECTION>
She casts a smile at him, then returns her attention to the parade. Hoagie navigates them through the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hoagie leads Ellen up a street no wider than an alley. The old houses seem to lean toward each other. The street is empty because its residents are all at the festival, whose noise follows them as they move away from it.
</DIRECTION>
<HOAGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A few more houses....
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOAGIE>
<DIRECTION>
They move on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ellen watches from the street as Hoagie and Charles Townsend, an islander, black, talk quietly on the porch. She sees Hoagie take a small, bulging envelope from his pocket and give it to Charles, who looks inside, smiles, then puts it in his pocket. The two men shake hands.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Spade's a garden tool....
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
Jake looks up from his clipboard and sees staring at him, the dead black eye of a fish whose pupil looks to be about the size of a bowling ball. He freezes, staring back at it.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) (continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Trouble with you, Jake, is you have no sense of humor....

</MICHAEL>
<JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
(finding his voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holy shit!

The eye disappears and Jake starts looking for it.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Got a big fish down here....
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
THE BARGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael stands to scan the water and the shark explodes out of the water, over the low side of the barge, passing within a few feet of Clarence, who freezes, his mouth open with terrified surprise, and goes straight for Michael, who throws himself to the deck. The shark misses him by inches, unable to close its great jaws about him because of the width of the barge. As quickly as it appeared, the shark is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hoagie and Ellen fight their way across the street, through the festival parade. The noise is deafening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Ellen stops. She shudders as she did on the beach. Hoagie looks back and sees her and threads his way to her, bumping into several dancers as he goes. She's staring off into the distance, seeing something beyond the reach of her vision.
</DIRECTION>
<HOAGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's wrong?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOAGIE>
<ELLEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing....

She looks at him and manufactures a smile.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLEN>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm fine.

</ELLEN>
<HOAGIE>

</HOAGIE>
<ELLEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm terrific... Come on....
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
She grabs his hand and pulls him into a group of dancers, picking up their rhythm, trying desperately to get into it. He's forced to dance with her, though every bone in his body resists the idea.
</DIRECTION>
<HOAGIE>
<DIRECTION>
(yelling above the din)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give it up....
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOAGIE>
<DIRECTION>
She ignores him, throwing every ounce of energy she has into the dancing.
</DIRECTION>
<HOAGIE>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing; yelling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't keep doing this....
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOAGIE>
<DIRECTION>
Again she ignores him and he's bumped into and they lose each other for a moment. She dances on and he has to run to catch her. He takes her arm and stops her.
</DIRECTION>
<HOAGIE>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't keep doing this....
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOAGIE>
<DIRECTION>
The merrymakers pass around them like a river rushes past a rock. A band passes them and they can hardly hear themselves think.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
(shouting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You promised me a drink....
	</DIALOGUE>

</ELLEN>
<HOAGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give it up... Kick it in the ass... Get on with your life....
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOAGIE>
<DIRECTION>
The band passes and the noise settles, momentarily, to a dull roar as more dancers move around them.
</DIRECTION>
<HOAGIE>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know what you're going through. The nightmares will go away...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I ever tell you about the time I flew the pandas from China to a Zoo? The lady panda fell in love with me....
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOAGIE>
<DIRECTION>
Ellen starts to laugh. She can't stop herself. The music grows louder. He holds out his hand and she looks at it, then takes it and they look at each other for a long moment.
</DIRECTION>
<HOAGIE>

He moves to Michael.

Jake grins as a groundswell of excitement carries across the room, which is filled with gamblers and decorations for New Year's Eve. The joint is jumping. They look for its source and see Hoagie at the crap table, accepting the congratulations of those around him. He smiles as a large pile of chips is raked in front of him, adding to the pile he already has. Irma, an Islander, light-skinned who's dressed in a low-cut satin gown with sequins, is hanging on him.

Irma doesn't know what to make of Hoagie's interest in Ellen. Hoagie grins, closes his eyes for a moment, making his secret incantation, then opens them, smiles once more at Ellen and rolls. The dice skip down the table, bounce off the other end and settle. A soft moan goes up from the people around the table. Hoagie's grin wavers, then is restored.

</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Happy birthday, darling. ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
They raise their glasses in a chorus of "Happy Birthday," then drinking. Louisa grins, then eyes Jake.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't go weak in the knees on me tonight....
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUISA>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just want to make an honest woman of you....

</JAKE>
<LOUISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not going to marry you until you straighten out your life and your hair.

Irma watches it all, her gaze shifting from face to face as though she's watching a tennis match.
</DIRECTION>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At least he doesn't have a beard....

</CARLA>
<ELLEN>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you enjoy dealing blackjack?

<LOUISA>

	Manage the whole damn place some day. I'm looking forward to living in the style to which I would like to become accustomed....
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<LOUISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd have to manage a nookie parlor to do that....
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUISA>
<DIRECTION>
Hoagie roars. Ellen laughs. Carla nearly spits out her drink. Irma's not sure what's going on.
</DIRECTION>
<HOAGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I knew a piano player once who....
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOAGIE>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<DIRECTION>
Michael eyes Hoagie, none too pleased that he's joined them. Hoagie smiles at him and Michael smiles back steadily, a kind of challenge.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to marry me, you' re going to have to straighten out your life....
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUISA>
<ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
(getting into it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He looks perfectly responsible to me....
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN>
<LOUISA>

	Well, I think he's cute....

</MICHAEL>
<JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
(catching himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry....

</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
Michael starts to breathe again. Hoagie stands.
</DIRECTION>
<HOAGIE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Ellen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you suffer through a dance with me?

</HOAGIE>
<ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
(standing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll be sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
Michael shifts his gaze from Jake, who he's angry at, to Hoagie and his mother, a situation that's creating fresh alarm. They're moving to the dance floor. Irma is abjectly unhappy.
</DIRECTION>
<HOAGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have two right feet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOAGIE>
<ELLEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. I have two left....

<CARLA>

(to Michael)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you lighten up. This is supposed to be a party....
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<LOUISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My party....
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUISA>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's depressed because he's started to count conch when he goes to sleep....
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
Michael casts an unhappy look at Jake, then stands.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me....
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
He heads for the dance floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE DANCE FLOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ellen smiles at Hoagie, caught up in the story he's started telling her. He stops when he sees Michael heading for them. She sees her son.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(as lightly as he can)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mind if I cut in? Your date's lonely....
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<HOAGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The world would be a better place if more sons danced with their mothers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOAGIE>
<DIRECTION>
Hoagie returns to the table and Michael and Ellen start dancing.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(finally; a
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	trace of
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
sarcasm)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're having a good time....
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<ELLEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
Michael eyes Hoagie, who's joining the others, already getting caught up in their conversation.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop pouting. You look like you did when you were six and didn't get something you wanted.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at her.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I enjoy his company....
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't like him chasing around after you...I don't trust him....
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<ELLEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's not chasing and I'm not running. And that's ridiculous....
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
Michael clams up and she studies him.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been a pain in the ass and I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at her quizzically.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not going to bother you anymore about your work....
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not a pain in the ass....
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<ELLEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you let me finish. I've been working on this all day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles at him, then becomes serious.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your brother's death almost killed me. I m not sure I'll ever get over it. But I can't allow myself to keep on believing it was intentional. I'm not going to let an obsession run my life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
Michael stares at his mother uncomfortably.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not easy. None of it is. I have to find some way to get on with my life and I'm going to try. I finally figured that out. I'm going to do my best....
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
He doesn't seem all that happy.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's it? Good...I thought you'd break out the champagne....
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm pleased. I really am. Really....
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<ELLEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No more sharks. I'll stay for another week, then....
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You just got here....
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
(laughing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Children are never satisfied. I have my house, my friends, my job...My life, Michael. I have to live it. Besides, I'll be back. Now show your mother what a good dancer you are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
She rests her head on his shoulder and they dance on. His expression reveals confusion. He's caught between her effort to get rid of an idea and his suspicion that it may be true.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE DOCK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael walks from the Jeep to Neptune's Folly. It's the beginning of a new day and he hasn't slept and looks terrible.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEPTUNE'S FOLLY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He boards her, looking for Clarence and William.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>

</MICHAEL>
<JAKE>

</JAKE>

Michael heads for the cabin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BELOW DECKS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jake is at the bench, soldering wires into a small cylin- drical device. Another device like it is nearby on the bench along with several small speakers and an Oscilloscope.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened to Clarence and...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gave them the day off....
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
Michael moves to the bench, not sure what's going on. He watches Jake work.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What for? We've got a job to finish ...Why are you making the monitor?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As the sun slowly sets in the West, we bid a fond farewell to the family of conch....
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
As Jake speaks he presses the barbs from the monitor to Michael's chest and the sound of his heart is heard over a speaker and its rhythms are seen on the oscilloscope.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(pissed off)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell are you talking about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
Jake puts the barbs against his chest and his heart is heard and seen.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're out of money, partner.. We wrap it up, write it up and turn it in... How come your heart sounds stronger than mine? You got two of them...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We don't write up anything until we're done....
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.. .we're done, man....

</MICHAEL>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When I invited you...

</JAKE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We got it together, Jake....

</MICHAEL>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay...we got it together....
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(voice rising)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have at least three months' work left. We can't write a report...We don't know enough....
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've got a rare bird here, Michael. Great whites don't come to the Bahamas. There's never been one down here before. I'm not just going to let it swim away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My name goes on that report. It's a half-assed job, I don't get my doctorate. Neither do you....
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The shark will get it for us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
Michael takes a hard look at him, then starts to leave.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought we were planning a long rosy future together.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So did I....
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
Jake goes after him.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs Michael and they face each other.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Even if it's there, it won't be around forever. It'll figure out the water's too warm and take off. We'll never get this chance again.... It's what we were trained for, for Christ's sake. It's why you spent all that time on the books....
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at Michael, who's hesitating.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing; grinning)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll give it a few days, then it's back to the snails. Indulge me, Michael....
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
There's a long moment of silence as the two men stare at each other.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(finally)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know shit about electronics....
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
(laughing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't know shit about anything. Time you learned....

EXT. HOUSE - DAY

<CARLA>

(O.S.) (yelling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the third time this month you've forgotten to take it out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<DIRECTION>
She appears around the corner hauling a large plastic bag of garbage, heading for the street.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have a lot on my mind....
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
He appears behind her, engaged in the same task.
</DIRECTION>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It doesn't take much to remember what day they come....
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My brain is shrinking. There's only so much room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't give me that preoccupied scientist crap. I'm trying to get ready for....
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought artists worked with their subconscious....
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
She gives him a dirty look as they deposit the garbage bags in their "pickup" spot. He tries out a smile on her. It's not working today.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How come it's my responsibility?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because....
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<DIRECTION>
She starts for her studio.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, okay. Now I understand. All you had to do was explain it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
She ignores him and he watches her, frustrated, until she moves inside. Then he starts after her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STUDIO - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She grabs her welder's mask, then fires up her torch. He enters.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(before he's seen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I take out the garbage, because...I'm glad we got that straightened out....
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We don't have anything straightened out. You're uptight about something ...what's wrong?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why should there be anything wrong? I'm sitting around the house, enjoying my day off and you start yelling at me about garbage....
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
She gives him a hard, steady look which says, there's more to it than garbage.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing; quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell are we arguing about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know...You...I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<DIRECTION>
He moves toward her and she holds the torch toward him.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No fair, I'm not armed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then don't come any closer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Turn it off....
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No....
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Off....
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have work....
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've always wanted to make love to an angry welder. I've dreamed of nothing else since I was a small boy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
She can't help smiling. She turns the torch off and he moves the rest of the way to her and kisses her.
</DIRECTION>
<CARLA>
<DIRECTION>
(murmuring)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Close the door.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're at the beach....
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
She kisses him this time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BARGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jake is secured to the davit with a line. Michael is tying another line around his waist. Clarence and William are chumming the water with meat and blood. Several large chunks of horse meat are on lines, over the side. Jake holds a long pole to which the heart monitoring device, with its barbs, is attached. The big boat, their floating lab, is secured to one side of the barge.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sure you've done this before?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lots of times....
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
Michael tests the knot, then Jake moves to the edge of the barge and leans out as far as he can.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And it's always worked?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
(grinning back at him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So far..
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<CLARENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's coming....
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLARENCE>
<DIRECTION>
They see the fin making its way toward the barge. Michael tenses, moving back toward the center of the barge until the line he's holding goes taut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jake, the pole held high, watches as the shark gets closer, his body tensing as he gets ready.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael is rigid, mesmerized with the approaching shark, his expression filled with what he's wondering -- will it try to get him?
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You remember how to pull a rope...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
Michael looks at Jake blankly, then stares at the oncoming shark, which comes closer and closer, then, at the last moment rolls to its side and opens its great jaws and goes for the horse meat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jake waits until the shark's underside is at its most exposed, then rams the pole into it, then pulls it back quickly.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hot damn! We got it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
Michael is still transfixed. Jake looks back at him.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now would be a good time....
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
Michael remembers his job and pulls Jake back to the barge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shark, a thirty-pound piece of horse meat in its mouth, rolls away, disappearing beneath the surface.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's see if the damn thing works....
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
WATERFRONT CAFE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ocean is like a blue-green lake, its placid surface reflecting the early afternoon sun.
</DIRECTION>
<HOAGIE>
<DIRECTION>
(0.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't have to go....
	</DIALOGUE>

Ellen stares out at the water, her expression wistful.
</DIRECTION>
<HOAGIE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) (continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't have to do anything you don't want to....
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOAGIE>
<DIRECTION>
She turns to Hoagie, who's sitting across the table from her. He sips his coffee and studies her. She looks past him to the others who are still eating lunch.
</DIRECTION>
<HOAGIE>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our little island seems to agree with you....
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOAGIE>
<ELLEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have my own little island.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN>
<HOAGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But it gets cold in winter....
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOAGIE>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles at that and sips her coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<HOAGIE>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I tried winter once. Burlington, Vermont. Flew a run to New York. I have a bone in my foot that still hasn't thawed. When I was a small boy....
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOAGIE>
<ELLEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's hard to imagine....
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN>
<HOAGIE>
<DIRECTION>
(grinning)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I dreamed about always being warm... Stay a while....
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOAGIE>
<DIRECTION>
His tone of voice causes her to look at him quizzically.
</DIRECTION>
<HOAGIE>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could take some time off....
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOAGIE>
<ELLEN>

</ELLEN>
<HOAGIE>

She smiles and he returns it.

His expression takes on the color of his feelings. He likes this woman, a lot.
</DIRECTION>
<HOAGIE>

She's flustered and unsure how to respond.

NEPTUNE'S FOLLY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shark's heartbeat is heard, then seen on the scope. Jake glances at it, then at Michael, who's at the wheel.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are we getting out of this old bucket?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<MICHAEL>

</MICHAEL>
<JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
(muttering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit....
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
He turns his attention back to the scope. The heartbeat line is beginning to flatten. Jake climbs up on the boom and scans the water. Michael does the same from his position at the wheel. He looks to Jake, who's shielding his eyes against the glare, holding the mast with his other hand.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>

Jake turns his attention back to the water. The sound of the heartbeat is growing weaker.

<MICHAEL>

Jake checks the EKG scope. The line is nearly flat. The heartbeats are a whisper.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's after my mother....

Jake laughs, looking at Michael as though he's crazy.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's so funny about that?

	You think he's not good enough for her? You're right. If she was my mother, I'd send her home right now.

He turns his attention back to the scope, then scans the water.

</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
The heartbeats have stopped and Jake snaps around to look at the scope. The line is dead flat. He's stunned.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We lost it....

</JAKE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>

</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
Jake gives him an angry look, then starts fiddling with the gear. Finally, in his frustration, he bangs it with his hand. Michael seems quietly relieved.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>

Michael doesn't respond.

Neither of them sees Thea, who's moved into the studio and has decided not to announce herself.

</CARLA>
<ELLEN>

	Part of me wanted to go off with him, the rest of me couldn't...I don't know why he wants me....

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's silly...I'm getting too old for this sort of thing....

She spots Thea and stops suddenly. Carla follows her gaze.

INT. HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael stands at the window, looking out at the night. He's troubled. He clasps his hands behind his back, unaware that Thea is standing behind him, her troubled expression a mirror of his, her hands behind her back, her tiny feet spread apart exactly like his. He scratches his cheek unconsciously and she does the same. She checks his facial expression and resets hers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sighs and she sighs and he hears and looks down, surprised to see her, then noticing that she's assumed his body posture in every way. He makes a funny face and she makes one back and he smiles and she returns it.
</DIRECTION>
<THEA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uncle Sean could make funny faces....
	</DIALOGUE>
</THEA>
<DIRECTION>
He snatches her up off the floor and hugs her, holding onto her tightly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ellen watches from the doorway, unobserved, her concern for her son etched into her expression. He sees her and she offers a quick smile.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
(to Thea)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Time for bed, peanut....

</THEA>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good night, dear heart....
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
Thea leaves and Michael takes a beer from the refrigerator and moves to the table where three empty cans are lined up neatly. He pops the top of the new one and takes a long drink, then sits and returns to the writing of his report on their conch project. There are several open textbooks and several notebooks in front of them.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
(finally)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

</ELLEN>
<MICHAEL>

(angry)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm tired of hearing about it. There's no shark. Sean wasn't killed by the same shark.. Dad didn't die because of it...It's all wrong... Some fantasy you've concocted...You keep bringing it up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
He goes back to work, ignoring her. She wants to say more but stops herself. Instead she starts looking through the refrigerator.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
(finally; quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You hungry?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN>

	No.

</MICHAEL>

She watches him, her expression sad and filled with concern.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE WATER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The surface is searched, as though something is being looked for. The shark is seen, swimming, just swimming, its fin slicing through the water as though it's hearing its own music. Then, without warning, it attacks, coming straight at us, its great jaws opening wide, rolling to one side as it comes for the kill -- its great rows of teeth enveloping us, closing down on us, consuming us, until it goes dark.
</DIRECTION>

INT. HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Jake watches the scope, which is dead flat. There's no sound coming from the speaker next to it.

Clarence and William, on the barge, search the surface of the water with binoculars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BENEATH THE WATER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael continues to search for conch. From his point of view, the water is clear, filled only with colorful fish and streaks of sunlight from above. Then he spots a small group of conch.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>

	I've got about a half dozen...I'm going to tag them. You hearing anything?

Michael pushes the sub to its limit, when suddenly it's hit and Michael's teeth are rattled as the sub is knocked through the water.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>

(yelling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jake! Jake!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
The shark hits the sub again, his great jaws tearing into the canopy and prop, damaging the sub badly. It turns then and almost leisurely swims away, its mouth bleeding, its head raked with cuts. Michael eyes it, then the nearby wreck and pushes himself free of the sub, swimming as fast as he can toward the freighter. The shark turns and starts after him, closing the distance rapidly as Michael makes for an opening in the wreck's hull.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
INT. WRECK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael swims into a corridor which is filled with light coming from one end. He turns and looks back at the hole. The shark is gone. He looks up and down the corridor, then starts swimming away from the light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The corridor begins to turn dark as a huge black shadow fills the other end.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael senses something and looks back and sees the shadow of the shark against the wall. He freezes as the shadow moves toward him, finally covering his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shark comes closer and Michael starts backing up. The shark moves closer, almost lazily opening its jaws as it prepares to devour him. Michael keeps backing up, then trips and falls backwards through a door, his arms coming up as he tries to stop himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His fall takes him down into a room. Light floods into it from above. He gathers himself and looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's no sign of the shark. He looks about quickly, taking measure of his situation, then the light above is blacked out as the shark swims slowly over the room. Michael watches, barely breathing, until the light returns. He listens and looks and waits. The silence builds. Where the hell is it?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BARGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The submersible pops to the surface, its ballast tank destroyed by the shark. Water pours from the space Michael occupied. The heartbeats continue to be heard. Jake, Clarence and William stare at the sub.

INT. WRECK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael eyes the opening above him. That, and the door he fell through, are the only way in or out. His breathing has returned to normal. He takes off his air tank, handling it with care.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's an explosion of wood and metal next to him and the shark bursts through the bulkhead. Quickly Michael pulls the regulator, blows the air from the tank, and rides upward on the force of air coming from the bottle, just barely escaping the great jaws. He shoots up through the opening above him, ripping his arm against the side of the opening as he passes through and the water starts to fill with blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE WATER/THE BARGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jake, Clarence and William have their air tanks strapped on. They each hold bang sticks and are getting ready to go in, when Michael explodes up above the surface right in front of them, gasping for air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jake jumps in the water and grabs Michael and Clarence and William pull Michael aboard and Jake climbs up after him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael crawls away from the edge of the barge. He's shaking. Jake moves to him. Clarence and William gather around.
</DIRECTION>

The light comes on and Michael looks at himself in the mirror, not sure he recognizes the image staring back at him His arm is bandaged where he cut himself escaping from the shark. He can hear his own heart beating.

THE PUBLIC BEACH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The beach and water are crowded with sunbathers and swimmers, with several banana boats and sailfish.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Up from the beach, a short distance away, a crowd has gathered to witness the unveiling of Carla's statue. The Mayor of the island, Mr. Witherspoon, a dignified black man, is in the midst of his dedication speech. The statue looms behind him, shrouded beneath its cloth. Carla, Ellen, Thea and Louisa, who totes a camera, along with several local "big-wigs" stand next to him.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<WITHERSPOON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something we look at every day, something we think beautiful...Something that makes us stop and ponder... Something that makes us question the wonder of life Even that becomes unique when it falls to the artist's eye....

<DIRECTION>
Thea, who's bored stiff, eyes a group of friends getting ready to go out on a banana boat, a long "hotdog" which five riders straddle, holding onto grips in front of them.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Today we are privileged to dedicate a work of art that reflects the true spirit, the free expression of life here in the Bahamas....
	</DIALOGUE>
</WITHERSPOON>
<DIRECTION>
Carla looks at Mr. Witherspoon cross-eyed and Louisa stifles a laugh and the two women exchange smiles. Then Carla looks at Ellen, who manages a small smile, then turns her attention back to Thea, who's taking the last empty seat, one from the back, just in front of Margaret's mother.
</DIRECTION>

The boat takes off behind its speedboat and the kids in it begin to shriek, Thea loudest of all.
</DIRECTION>
<WITHERSPOON>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) (continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So that whoever visits our public beach will be able to share in that spirit.

<WITHERSPOON>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ladies and gentlemen, Carla Brody....
	</DIALOGUE>
</WITHERSPOON>
<DIRECTION>
Applause greets her introduction and she nods and smiles her thanks, then she and Mr. Witherspoon both take hold of the cord which will pull the cloth from the statue. Louisa begins to video tape the proceedings. Someone gets in her way and she says something, then jostles for better position.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ellen eyes Thea as the banana boat makes a sweeping turn and heads back across the water in front of them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Mr. Witherspoon and Carla pull the cord, Ellen sees the fin pop up out of the water behind the banana boat. As the cloth comes free of the statue, the crowd breaks into loud, anticipatory applause. It covers Ellen's scream. She starts running for the beach, yelling as she goes. The fin moves closer to the boat. The applause begins to trickle away as the crowd begins to realize the nature of the huge abstract work of art. They don't understand it. Mr. Witherspoon looks at it quizzically.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ellen's screams are heard now and Carla sees her running along the beach, waving her arms. Then she sees what Ellen sees, the fin, and she and Louisa and the others start running.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BANANA BOAT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Margaret's mother sees what's going on on the beach and finally looks in back of her and sees the fin and then the shark as it comes up out of the water for Thea. She grabs the child, pushing her forward, putting herself in the way. The shark rips into her and she's pulled into the water, then beneath it. Thea screams, but nothing comes out. Air starts leaking from the inflatable boat. The water around it starts filling with blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ellen watches her granddaughter, horrified.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dozens of people line the water's edge around her, yelling, crowding around as the speedboat brings what's left of the banana boat to shore. Thea and the other two kids and remaining adult are holding on for dear life as they're dragged through the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carla, with Louisa at her heels, wades out toward them, frantic, yelling....
</DIRECTION>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thea...I'm here, Thea...Mommy's here....
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<DIRECTION>
Ellen stares at the sea, then at her granddaughter, who Carla has reached. When she sees that Thea is in one piece, unseen by anyone, she moves back through the crowd and starts away. She walks deliberately, then begins to march. Finally she breaks into a run and disappears from view.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BIG BOAT/THE DOCK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As a hand fumbles with a key and finally gets it into the engine, the distant sound of singing is heard. The key is turned and the engine cranks over a few times, then starts, drowning out the singing.
</DIRECTION>

	</DIALOGUE>
</HOAGIE>
<DIRECTION>
He points and they see a tiny dot of a boat in the distance. Hoagie starts for it and they watch as he drops altitude. There's a long silence as they strain to see the boat. When they get closer they see that it's a pleasure sailor. The people aboard wave at them.

THE BOAT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ellen searches the water for the shark. She puts the boat into a long slow turn. All she can see is the endless expanse of ocean around her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE WATER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boat is seen from the surface, from the point of view of something following her, keeping pace with her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shark is stalking her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PLANE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hoagie, Michael and Jake fly on in search of Ellen. Michael is raw nerve ends.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't this thing go any faster?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<HOAGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Any faster and it'll turn into a flying Cuisinart and dice us into oblivion....

</HOAGIE>
<DIRECTION>
Hoagie banks the plane, changing direction to search another area.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BOAT/THE WATER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ellen turns the wheel, beginning another sweep, searching for the shark. At first she doesn't see anything, then she goes rigid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hundred yards away she sees the fin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She shuts off the engine and, in the quiet, moves to the stern and looks at the shark, which is keeping its distance.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly; with deadly calm)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come and get me, you son-of-a-bitch. Take me and leave my family alone....
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
The silence builds as only the water lapping up against the side of the becalmed boat is heard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fin disappears beneath the surface and Ellen, still at the stern, her body trembling, looks for it. She can't see anything. The silence builds. She waits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, in the intense calm, the distant sound of an airplane engine droning is heard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PLANE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jake sees the boat and points.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There she is....
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
They see the boat and the tiny figure of Ellen at the stern. Hoagie alters course, dropping altitude as he goes. He starts fishing for a chart so he can radio her exact loca- tion. Michael rises in his seat to get a better view. He sees something in the water and strains to make out what it is.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE WATER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dark form of the shark is visible beneath the surface as it moves rapidly toward the boat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PLANE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They strain to see the form in the water as the plane moves rapidly closer to the boat.
</DIRECTION>
<HOAGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that what I think it is...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOAGIE>
<DIRECTION>
No answer is necessary as they watch the shark close the distance to the boat. It's going for Ellen.

<DIRECTION>
THE BOAT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shark comes exploding up out of the water for Ellen, missing her by only a few feet, taking a piece of the stern off the boat, then disappearing beneath the surface.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then she hears the plane and looks but doesn't seem to see it. She's in shock from the shark's attack, but is still dedicated to her mission.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The plane flies in low, buzzing the boat, the great roar of its engine causing Ellen to duck out of the way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PLANE - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Hoagie makes a tight circle and starts back.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>

Ellen watches the plane with horror as it comes in on a line parallel to the boat, coming closer and closer to the water.

	</DIALOGUE>
</HOAGIE>
<DIRECTION>
THE BOAT/THE PLANE/THE WATER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ellen backs away from the stern as the plane nears the surface and its engine sputters, then quits. It hits the water and its nose rocks forward, then it settles forward and skips some seventy-five feet, plowing through the water violently, finally coming to a stop near the boat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hoagie pushes the door open and water starts coming in.
</DIRECTION>
<HOAGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hell, that wasn't half bad.. Get going...I'll keep it busy....

Ellen sees Jake, then Michael swimming frantically for the boat.

<ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
(screaming)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Michael! No, goddamnit! No!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN>

Then she sees the shark heading for the plane and Hoagie and she stares at it and the image of Hoagie, who backs up to the door behind him.
</DIRECTION>

</ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
THE PLANE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shark attacks the plane, going straight for the cockpit, rising up out of the water, blocking Hoagie from view, taking a mouthful of door, then rolling off and disappearing beneath the surface. Hoagie is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael and Jake scramble aboard. They move quickly to Ellen and Michael puts his arm around her, trying to offer comfort. She's in shock. They stare at the plane as it starts to sink, scanning the water, looking for Hoagie.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It got him....

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That thing has terrible breath....

</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
Hoagie and Michael start for the engine. Ellen watches them, then looks out over the water for the shark. Jake turns on the heart monitor and EKG scope and a moment later the sound of the shark's heartbeat, which is faint, starts coming through the speaker, and the sight of its rhythmic beating is seen on the scope.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's working....
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
Hoagie watches as Michael tries to get the engine started. It won't turn over.

Jake heads for the cabin.

Michael follows Jake below. Hoagie jumps down into the engine pit and starts checking the fuel line.

Ellen stares out to sea, waiting for what she knows will happen.

The distant sounds of the shark's heart continue to be heard.

BELOW DECKS - DAY

Jake takes the top off an underwater strobe light and begins rewiring rapidly, changing connections. Michael watches.

Hoagie hands Ellen sparkplugs, which she dries with a rag. She continues to glance at the sea, her expression set with the inevitable. The shark's faint heartbeats are heard.

<DIRECTION>
BELOW DECKS - DAY

Jake is taping a cover over the strobe base. Michael is wiring another strobe light to the battery.

ABOVE DECKS - DAY

As Michael and Jake move topside, they see Hoagie and Ellen staring at the speaker and EKG scope. The heartbeats have stopped. The line on the scope is flat.

</MICHAEL>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>

Jake grabs a pole from the deck and throws it to Michael, then starts tying the device to the end of it. His hands are trembling.
</DIRECTION>
<HOAGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe it had a heart attack. Too much fatty food. Humans are full of cholesterol.

Hoagie gets the last sparkplug screwed back in and tries the engine and it kicks to life.

	</DIALOGUE>
</HOAGIE>

She just stares at him, not believing it for a moment.

Jake is standing at the bow, looking out over the water. Michael reaches him with the line.

</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
Michael relents and quickly ties the line around Jake's waist. Jake makes his way out to the end of the bowsprit, using the guy wire from the mast for support. Michael passes him the pole with the device at the end of it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ellen and Hoagie watch from the stern. He's underway.

</DIRECTION>
<ELLEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Michael!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
Jake moves back on the bowsprit, getting in the shark's way, and as the shark flies up toward Jake, he rams the pole down its throat. The pole snaps and the shark takes the device, Jake and a piece of the bowsprit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ellen screams.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The guy wire flies loose and the already weakened mast begins to fall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael pulls at the line, which goes limp in his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jake, in the shark's mouth, goes crashing into the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The mast crashes into the boat and water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ellen and Hoagie are running forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael watches as Jake and the shark disappear beneath the surface.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the distance, the three of them see the shark rise up out of the water. Part of Jake is seen in its jaws. Then they're gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The heartbeats are heard again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael opens his mouth and a great wail of anguish comes out and carries out over the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hoagie dashes back toward the controls. Ellen, taking strength from her son's need, grabs his arm, hard.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLEN>

<DIRECTION>
Michael stares at the sea. Ellen looks at her son compassionately, then Michael starts for the cabin and Ellen follows to the deck near Hoagie, where she watches the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shark's heartbeats are getting louder and closer together. Hoagie eyes the speaker as he opens the throttle, giving it everything its got.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BELOW DECKS - DAY

Michael grabs the slave switch and turns it on and it begins to whine as the strobe unit in the shark's stomach begins to charge.

	<DIALOGUE>

The heartbeats sound like an invitation to hell. Hoagie grabs Ellen's arm.
</DIRECTION>
<HOAGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take the wheel....
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOAGIE>
<DIRECTION>
He leaves it before she does and runs to the cabin. She takes his place, glancing at the water, seeing the fin. Her expression floods with rage and she turns the wheel toward the shark, trying to meet it head on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BELOW DECKS - DAY

Hoagie sticks his head in the door.

<DIRECTION>
They start topside. Michael brings the slave switch with him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ABOVE DECKS/THE WATER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ellen is bringing the boat directly toward the shark, which is coming straight for them. The heartbeats are deafening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Hoagie and Michael move topside, the boat and the shark collide head on, sending shock waves from stem to stern. Ellen holds onto the wheel with both hands and keeps her feet. Michael and Hoagie are knocked on their asses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The heartbeats retreat, then start growing louder and stronger again. The whine of the strobe has stopped. Michael hits the switch several times and it starts again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ellen sees the fin and steers toward it. The shark is coming again, like an old boxer looking for the knockout punch in the fifteenth round.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boat and the shark are heading for each other, the distance between them closing fast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ellen drives the boat toward it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The slave switch makes a popping sound, and Michael hits the switch and the flash in his hand goes off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The water explodes as the shark receives an enormous jolt of electricity. It thrashes about wildly then, in slow motion, some twenty-five feet from the boat, right in front of it, the shark rises up out of the water, exposing half its body. It seems suspended there, its great head pointed right at Ellen, its dead black eyes seeming to stare straight at her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holding fast to the wheel, her expression set hard, Ellen drives the boat straight at the shark. She pushes the throttle forward, hard, getting the last bit of speed from the engine, driving straight into the beast, impaling it in the throat with what's left of the sharp jagged end of the bowsprit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shark goes crazy, its weight pulling the bow down into the water as it tries to free itself, thrashing about so violently that it turns the bow into splinters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ellen, Michael and Hoagie are thrown into the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE WATER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They watch as the shark dies its violent death, taking what remains of the boat beneath the surface with it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BENEATH THE SURFACE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shark and the boat sink slowly to the bottom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SURFACE - DAY
</DIRECTION>

Ellen, exhausted, emptied of everything, begins to sob. Everything she feels, everything she's suppressed about Sean's death pours out of her. She begins to slip beneath the surface. Hoagie grabs her.

Michael reaches them and together, helping Ellen, they swim to a large piece of the boat which is floating nearby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holding it, catching their breath, Ellen still crying, they look out across the water, silently remembering Jake.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>

	<DIALOGUE>
	It's over....
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
Ellen stares at the sea, her expression etched with uncertainty. Is it over? Will it ever be?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Our vision shifts from Ellen to her point of view of the endless expanse of ocean. In the distance the clouds seem to be reaching for its surface. Slowly, almost indiscernibly at first, the closing music begins. Another sound, that of airplane engines is heard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE AIRPORT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The noise of the air taxi's engines, as they're warmed up, is loud. The music, which builds slowly, relentlessly, continues. Closing credits begin, like punctuation marks. Hoagie is in the cockpit.
</DIRECTION>

Ellen, who's dressed for travel, Michael, who carries Thea, and Carla approach the plane.

<THEA>

(yelling;
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

excitement)

They've reached the plane and Hoagie and Ellen make eye contact.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(eyeing

	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
and Hoagie)

</MICHAEL>
<ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
(turning

<HOAGIE>

</HOAGIE>
<ELLEN_HOAGIE>
<DIRECTION>
(both yelling;
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	both enjoying
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
the moment)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In case you got hit by a car....
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN_HOAGIE>
<DIRECTION>
They laugh above the noise. Michael and Hoagie eye each other.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(yelling at Hoagie)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, you try harder not to give a damn than anyone I've ever met?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
Hoagie, straining to hear, grins.
</DIRECTION>
<HOAGIE>
<DIRECTION>
(yelling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOAGIE>
<DIRECTION>
Michael moves closer, Thea still in his arms.
</DIRECTION>
<THEA>
<DIRECTION>
(before
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Michael can repeat himself; yelling). Can I fly the plane again...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THEA>
<DIRECTION>
The music dips now, as Hoagie takes a long 1ook at Thea, his smile building warmly.
</DIRECTION>
<HOAGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Absolutely...Any time....
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOAGIE>
<DIRECTION>
He beckons her with his finger and Michael holds her closer.
</DIRECTION>
<HOAGIE>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you keep a secret? Something no one else knows?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOAGIE>
<THEA>
<DIRECTION>
(still
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	yelling at the top of
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
her lungs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes I can....
	</DIALOGUE>
</THEA>
<HOAGIE>
<DIRECTION>
(yelling back)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I own the airplane. I can do whatever I want. I'm the boss.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOAGIE>
<DIRECTION>
Michael, Ellen and Carla react.
</DIRECTION>
<HOAGIE>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which means I have to go a lot of places to pay my debts and borrow money to keep it going....
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOAGIE>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at Michael with mischief in his eye. The music begins to build again, toward its climax. Credits continue.
</DIRECTION>
<HOAGIE>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing; yelling louder)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Remind me when I get back to tell you about the time I flew a hundred nuns to Nairobi....
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOAGIE>
<DIRECTION>
Michael and others laugh, but it's lost in the sound of the engines and the music. The family moves to the plane's door. Ellen kisses Carla and Thea good-bye, then turns to Michael.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
(above the noise)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We never had that talk, did we?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at her, troubled, and she smiles at him.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We will...We'll have a lot of time together, Michael....
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(shouting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to finish what Jake and I started. I owe him that. Hell, I owe him everything....
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(shouting; hardly heard)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll get something important done for both of us....
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
Ellen and Michael embrace, then kiss each other good-bye.
</DIRECTION>
<HOAGIE>
<DIRECTION>
(yelling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There they were, all hundred of them....
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOAGIE>
<DIRECTION>
His last words are drowned out by engines and music and he shrugs as he and Ellen smile at each other. She takes a last look at her family, then boards the plane and the door closes behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE AIRPORT/THE PLANE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As music and credits continue, the plane takes off and starts out over the ocean, heading for Nassau.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael, holding Thea, and Carla, her arm through his, watch as the plane becomes smaller and smaller, until it is lost in the vastness of the sky and the sky is transformed into ocean and music and credits end.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
