But I also believe this is simply my own perverted form of self-aggrandizement, that no one really talks about me at all. What possible interest is an old, bald, fat man to anyone? I am repulsive.

There are certainly ghosts in the Fakahatchee -- ghosts of rangers who were murdered years ago by illegal plume hunters, and of loggers who were cut to pieces in fights, and for years there has been an apparition wandering the swamp, the Swamp Ape, which is said to be seven feet tall and seven hundred pounds and have the physique of a human, the posture of an ape, and the body odor of a skunk.

	Kaufman sits across from Valerie, a pretty film executive. He eyes her as she picks at her salad. She looks up and he looks down. He sweats. She compliments him on his work. She rubs her nose. He pulls at his nostrils. He tries to sound like he knows what he's talking about. He's full of shit.

Orlean walks through alone, panicked. All the vegetation is greener and crazier-looking than we've seen before. Things slither by in the water, brush up against her.

She tenses, steps into a sinkhole, flails, gets tangled in a vine, which wraps around her leg as she attempts to extricate herself. She falls face forward into the black water.

Orlean snaps awake, bedcovers tangled around her legs. She heaves, looks at the clock. It's 3:30. She stares at the ceiling. She looks at the clock again. It's 3:30. She looks at the clock again. It's 4:10. She closes her eyes. She opens them, looks at the clock, the room is filled with murky water, the bed an island of dryness. An alligator pokes its nose out of the water, begins to climb onto the bed. Orlean jumps back, hits her head on the headboard. The room is back to normal. The clock reads 4:23. She closes her eyes. The alarm goes off.

The sun has come up strong. It looks hot. Laroche speeds along with one finger on the wheel, paying little attention to the road. The car veers onto the shoulder, he lazily corrects it. Orlean is tense.
</DIRECTION>
<LAROCHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I remember one time when I was a kid, fifteen or so, my mother and I came to the Fakahatchee to look for a ghost to photograph. We walked for hours, through the most intense heat I'd ever felt. We couldn't find one. I wanted to turn back. But my mom said, no. She said, John, if you keep searching for something past doubt, past hopelessness, past the absolute certainty that you'll never find it, if you keep searching past that, there it'll be. So we walked. I had goddamn bloody blisters on my feet. And we found ourselves in this charred prairie, desolate, sun blasted, y'know. And there in the middle of it was this one gorgeous, snowy Polyrrhiza lindenii.

<ORLEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He made it sound like a Bible story, the hopeful journey through darkness into light. I never thought many people in the world were like John, but I was realizing more and more that Laroche was an extreme, not an aberration -- most people in some way or another do strive for something exceptional, something to pursue, even at their peril, rather than abide an ordinary life.

Laroche and Orlean step off the levee into black water. They sink to their knees. The ground is soft; it's a struggle to pull their feet up to walk. Things slither past in the water. Something big runs by in the distance. Bees, and dragonflies hover. Gnats and mosquitoes bite. Birds screech. Frogs croak. Laroche points to a yellow flower.

Kaufman rides up in the crowded elevator. It stops a few times; people get off and on. Kaufman sweats. The doors open. The New Yorker logo is painted on the wall opposite the elevator. Nobody gets off or on. The doors close. The elevator continues up. Kaufman hates himself. Soon the elevator is emptied out with the exception of Kaufman. It begins its descent and stops once again at the New Yorker. This time Orlean gets on. Kaufman is absolutely panicked. Orlean looks at him blankly, presses "lobby", and faces front. Kaufman sweats, studies the back of her head. The elevator arrives at the lobby. Orlean gets out. Kaufman hesitates, then follows.

<MCKEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Long speechs are antithetical to the nature of cinema. The Greeks called it stykomythia -- the rapid exchange of ideas. A long speech in a script, say a page long, requires that the camera hold on the actor's face for a minute. Look at the second hand on your watch as it makes one complete rotation around the clock face and you'll get an idea of how intolerable that would be for an audience. The ontology of the screen is that it's always now and it's always action and it's always vivid. Life is rarely vivid. And that's an important point. We are not recreating life on the screen. Writers are not tape recorders. Have you ever eavesdropped on people talking in a coffee shop? Then you know how dull and tedious real conversation is. Real people are not interesting. There's not a person in this world -- and I include myself in this -- who would be interesting enough to take as is and put in a movie as a character.

	You talked about Crisis as the ultimate decision a character makes, but what if a writer is attempting to create a story where nothing much happens, where people don't change, they don't have any epiphanies.

	The real world? The real fucking world? First of all, if you write a screenplay without conflict or crisis, you'll bore your audience to tears. Secondly: Nothing happens in the real world? Are you out of your fucking mind? People are murdered every day! There's genocide and war and corruption! Every fucking day somewhere in the world somebody sacrifices his life to save someone else! Every fucking day someone somewhere makes a conscious decision to destroy someone else! People find love! People lose it, for Christ's sake! A child watches her mother beaten to death on the steps of a church! Someone goes hungry! Somebody else betrays his best friend for a woman! If you can't find that stuff in life, then you, my friend, don't know much about life! And why the fuck are you taking up my precious two hours with your movie? I don't have any use for it!

	Back in John's basement he explained his real plans for the ghost. He'd discovered a chemical inside with psychoactive properties. His plan had always been to clone the flower and make a fortune marketing this drug. It was Laroche's kind of plan, it wasn't a controlled substance because the government didn't know it existed.

Laroche parks. Kaufman parks behind him. Orlean gestures with her gun for him to get out. As Kaufman comes around the car, he sees Donald on the floor of the back seat. Laroche emerges from his van with a flashlight and a rifle slung over his shoulder. Orlean prods Kaufman to follow him. Kaufman shakes and whimpers as they all step down into the thigh-high water. They slog through silently. Laroche stops.

Laroche paces. Orlean finds a place to sit on a hammock. She unwraps a small square of paper and snorts something out of it. Kaufman shivers. Orlean's drugs kick in.

</ORLEAN>
<DIRECTION>
Orlean trails off. Laroche talks to the spaced out Orlean.
</DIRECTION>
<LAROCHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Should we drown him, then hit him on the head? Uh-uh. A body bleeds different if the heart's stopped. These new forensic guys are very smart. We really have to know our corpses to stand a chance: rigor mortis, lividity, putrefecation, ocular changes. Maybe you think we hit him on the head and force water into his lungs after he's dead? No, darlin'. They'll know he didn't drown. See, contrary to popular belief, the lungs do not -- do not -- fill with water in a drowning. What happens is, choking causes an irritation of the mucous membranes. This creates a shitload of mucus in the windpipe. Efforts to breathe turn the mucus into a sticky foam which may or may not mix with vomit. It's the presence of this white foam that indicates drowning. There's a lot to be aware of, Susie. Shoeprints, hair, microscopic fibers. Tire tracks. They all tell a tale to today's forensic scientists.

The brothers run in the opposite direction. The galloping gets louder. It's wild pigs. Donald spots an airboat on the shore. They jump onto it, search hysterically in the dark for bow to start it. The pigs get closer. Laroche and Orlean get closer. Donald finds a button, presses it, the engine starts. They pull away from the shore just as the pigs catch up. One pig leaps on board, squealing. Kaufman kicks at it as Donald attempts to steer the boat. A kick connects and the pig flies into the water.

Donald dies. Kaufman screams heavenward. The van appears out of the bush, barreling for them. Kaufman rolls his brother out of the way, and limps off into a slough. The van follows, smashes into a tree, and comes to a halt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smoke pours from the grill and is lit by the headlights. Out of the smoke, Laroche and Orlean appear with guns. They follow Kaufman into the swamp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mike Owen pulls next to the disabled van. He gets out, surveys the mess, sees bloody Donald on the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE_OWEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, that writer guy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE_OWEN>
<DIRECTION>
Owen grabs his C.B., tries to radio for help. It's broken. He lifts Donald into the back of the truck and speeds off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kaufman limps through the dark water. Laroche and Orlean follow the sound of his sloshing.
</DIRECTION>
<ORLEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Water sounds so sparkly. Like lemon plastic jewels plopping onto a silver trampoline! Dontcha think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ORLEAN>
<LAROCHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Darlin', please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAROCHE>
<ORLEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can we fuck now, baby? Fuck like lemons?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ORLEAN>
<DIRECTION>
Owen tears along the dirt road. Up ahead, Kaufman limps out of the swamp, into the truck's headlights. Owen is confused. He checks the back to see if Donald's body is still there and skids off the road into the swamp. Kaufman hurriedly limps over to the disabled truck. Owen climbs out.
</DIRECTION>
<KAUFMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You gotta help me. You gotta help me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAUFMAN>
<MIKE_OWEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell is going on here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE_OWEN>
<KAUFMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're after me. They've got guns. They killed my brother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAUFMAN>
<MIKE_OWEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's got guns? What are you --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE_OWEN>
<DIRECTION>
Before Owen finishes, his truck is flipped over. Donald's body flies into the water. There, staring Kaufman and Owen down, is a giant man-like beast. It's repulsive, covered in algae-matted fur.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE_OWEN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holy shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE_OWEN>
<DIRECTION>
The two men turn and run.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE_OWEN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's real! I can't believe it, I never --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE_OWEN>
<DIRECTION>
The creature grabs Owen and snaps his neck like a toothpick. Kaufman screams as he runs, watches over his shoulder. He runs right into the arms of Orlean.
</DIRECTION>
<ORLEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, it's the screenwriter!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ORLEAN>
<KAUFMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's a thing back there! You don't want to be here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAUFMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Kaufman, Orlean, and Laroche look back. Nothing there.
</DIRECTION>
<LAROCHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're right, I don't want to be here. I'm tired, let's get this over with.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAROCHE>
<DIRECTION>
Laroche puts the gun to Kaufman's head. Kaufman tenses. Orlean studies Laroche's gun. Her nose is practically touching the barrel.
</DIRECTION>
<ORLEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love your gun, baby. Can we trade?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ORLEAN>
<LAROCHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stand back, sweetness.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAROCHE>
<DIRECTION>
Laroche reaches for Orlean's arm to pull her away. Suddenly the creature grabs Laroche, pulls him into the swamp.
</DIRECTION>
<LAROCHE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Susie! Susie!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAROCHE>
<DIRECTION>
Orlean looks around.
</DIRECTION>
<ORLEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where'd Johnny go?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ORLEAN>
<LAROCHE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Susie!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAROCHE>
<DIRECTION>
Orlean, agitated and disoriented, fires repeatedly into the darkness. Something slumps forward in the water. Orlean steps cautiously over, keeping her gun on Kaufman. The creature is dead, so is Laroche.
</DIRECTION>
<ORLEAN>
<DIRECTION>
(crying softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Johnny.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ORLEAN>
<DIRECTION>
She sits next to Laroche and pets his head. Kaufman watches her. The sun is coming up.
</DIRECTION>
<KAUFMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd just stare at your picture, and you looked so sweet. I read your words and I thought you were smart and maybe lost and lonely like me. And the way you wrote about Laroche. You said he was handsome even though he had no front teeth --
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAUFMAN>
<ORLEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Johnny. Johnny's teeth. Oh...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ORLEAN>
<KAUFMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I figured you could look at me and see something, even with all my flaws you could look at me and find something, you could maybe someday write a description of me that would be nicer than the one I write day in and day out in my head.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(hopefully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would it be?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAUFMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Kaufman takes Orlean's chin in his hand and directs her gaze to him. She stares at him for a long while, then:
</DIRECTION>
<ORLEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're really so wonderful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ORLEAN>
<KAUFMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAUFMAN>
<ORLEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So wonderful. I can see inside your soul. It glows with orange sadness. It's raining inside you. I want to run through your dripply dripples. It's so beautiful. I love you. I do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ORLEAN>
<DIRECTION>
Kaufman lets go of her face and sits on a rock.
</DIRECTION>
<KAUFMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the drugs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAUFMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Orlean stands and walks toward Kaufman.
</DIRECTION>
<ORLEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it's me. It's the real me. Look at you. I just want to hold you and -- Oh, crap, it's wearing off. Crap!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ORLEAN>
<DIRECTION>
She paces, unfolds her little square of paper.
</DIRECTION>
<ORLEAN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm out. I'm fucking cleaned out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ORLEAN>
<DIRECTION>
Kaufman watches her for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<KAUFMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, bye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAUFMAN>
<ORLEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't let you go, fatty. I can't let you make this public.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ORLEAN>
<DIRECTION>
Kaufman keeps walking.
</DIRECTION>
<ORLEAN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You hear me? You pathetic, fat, bald... You don't even know how to write! You're not even... You're not leaving here!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(screaming, crying)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need a fix! Everything's so ugly!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ORLEAN>
<DIRECTION>
Orlean screams in anguish. Kaufman keeps walking. Orlean shakily aims the gun at his back. She shoots. Kaufman falls, gets up, keeps walking. She aims again through her tears. Suddenly she's pounced on by a bloody, soaking wet figure. Kaufman turns.
</DIRECTION>
<KAUFMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Donald!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAUFMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Kaufman limps back. Donald and Orlean roll on the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DONALD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My brother is not fat. He's not bald. My brother is a great writer! He was trying to do something important!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONALD>
<DIRECTION>
The gun fires. Orlean slumps over Donald. Kaufman arrives. Both Donald and Orlean are dead. Kaufman falls to his knees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. SWAMP - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sun is high. Fires smoulder. A tow-truck extricates one of the crashed vehicles. State police cars, ambulances, ranger trucks abound. Kaufman is wrapped in a blanket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is with a cop and pointing to the bodies spread on a black plastic tarp.
</DIRECTION>
<KAUFMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's Mike Owen. John Laroche. Susan Orlean. I don't know what that is. I think it might be a Swamp Ape. And that's Donald, my twin brother. He saved my life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAUFMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Kaufman cries a little. The cop waits sympathetically, then:
</DIRECTION>
<POLICE_OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You two really look alike.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POLICE_OFFICER>
<KAUFMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(proudly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Yes, we do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAUFMAN>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. CALIFORNIA PIZZA KITCHEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kaufman sits in a booth, working longhand on a legal pad. He's a little scraped-up, a little tougher. A copy of Story by McKee is among his reference material. Alice, the waitress, walks by and glances at the table.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I love McKee!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(recognizes Kaufman, gets reserved)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, hi. Haven't seen you in a while.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<KAUFMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi. Yeah, I've been away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAUFMAN>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you studying screenwriting?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<KAUFMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm actually finishing one up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAUFMAN>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good for you! Me too. God, it's so hard to get in, huh? Everyone and their brother is writing a screenplay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<KAUFMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Actually I'm writing this one for Sony Pictures.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAUFMAN>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? Wow. Really? That's so cool.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow! So what's it about, if you don't mind my asking?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<KAUFMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's tough. Let's see... about being yourself, maybe. It's about learning that if you can't love yourself, you can't really love anyone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAUFMAN>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's true. God, that's so true. It's such an important message, y'know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<KAUFMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See, my twin brother was murdered recently --
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAUFMAN>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh God! I'm sorry. That's so horrible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<KAUFMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks. Like part of me ripped away. Forever. It was a wake up call.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAUFMAN>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm so sorry. You poor man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<KAUFMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyway, it helped put things in perspective. Life is a miracle. All life, from the flower to the human being. You. Me. And I want to show people that. For my brother. For everyone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAUFMAN>
<DIRECTION>
There's a pause. Alice just stares at him, in awe.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, do you mind if I sit for a sec?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<KAUFMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you're working.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAUFMAN>
<ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
(shrugs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a stupid job, y'know. I'm Alice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<KAUFMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Charlie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAUFMAN>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like that name. Charlie. I've always really liked that name. Charlie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
Alice smiles, sits. The two of them begin to talk.
