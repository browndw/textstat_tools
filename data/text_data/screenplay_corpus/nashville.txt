At the entrance is another "CONNIE WHITE" display and from the jukebox we hear one of her songs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The waitress, SUELEEN, drops a fork, then gets another from an overflowing sink and hands it to her customer, TRICYCLE MAN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There are several people at the counter with him, including GREEN, who has just walked in. Another man enters, DELBERT REESE. SUELEEN waits on all of them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small black man comes out of the kitchen, carrying a tray full or dishes. This is WADE.

REESE looks up, checking out SUELEEN, then WADE, then the TRICYCLE MAN, then his breast pocket to see it his wallet and checkbook are still there, then he buries himself in his newspaper.

	I've just been waiting for the right spot to sing in... I'm so nervous...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUELEEN>
<DIRECTION>
She laughs and starts to rinse the dishes in the sink.
</DIRECTION>
<SUELEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm good, though. There ain't but one Sueleen Gay -- I don't mean to be conceited, but really it's true. I've been taking special coaching lessons from Zeke Willard -- he's just wonderful. Teaches you how to phrase; that's really important. And breathing. Well, you know all about that. Anyway, I wrote this song.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUELEEN>
<DIRECTION>
She looks down and then begins to half whisper, sing, and half do all of the gestures for a song she has written as she wipes some glasses. The jukebox continues to play CONNIE WHITE, and every time someone walks by, Sueleen stops. She finally gets through the song and discovers REESE has been watching, too. She looks away from him to the TRICYCLE MAN, who smiles. Be has finished his meal.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, listen, I really do go on. Here's your check. Sure has been nice talking to you.

A wave of noise begins from the fans. The band and majorettes and horses and ropers go into a rendition of one of her hit tunes as BARBARA JEAN appears. Everyone is breaking their neck to see, especially GLENN. HAVEN and REESE give her the first round of applause, then go back to talking. TRIPLETTE has never been exposed to anything quite like this before and stands a little in awe of the situation.

	<DIALOGUE>
	We want to send special wishes to Barbara Jean who is in the Baptist Hospital. She collapsed yesterday morning at the plane christening. Send your prayers and letters to Baptist Hospital, Nashville, Tennessee. Barnett said she wept because she couldn't be here with you friends and neighbors. But your faith in the great Almighty will bring her back here just to be what you want her to be... And her good friend, Connie White, has given up some time with her own mother, who is sick with a kidney disorder, to fill in and send her warmth to you wonderful friends and neighbors so you won't be too disappointed after this message from teeth-sticken, good, gooey clusters.

	Well, it's not too hard. You'll sing whatever it is you want to sing. They'll applaud like crazy 'cause I can tell them that you're really something and then the piano and drum will give you a little fanfare and you can sing and take off your clothes or not sing. It really doesn't make much difference, really. But since you've never done this before, singing might help.
