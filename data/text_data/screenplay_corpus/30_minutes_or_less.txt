Before he can ring the bell, the door opens and two smug 15- YEAR-OLDS stare out.

<CHRISTOPHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yeah? 'Cause, I got some kids calling in saying you ripped them off. Promised to buy them beer or something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTOPHER>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I actually did buy the beer, but it would have been illegal to give it to them, right? So I'm gonna do the responsible thing and drink it myself.

	That's real funny. But I'm trying to run a business here.

EXT. SMALL APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT Will sits on the darkened front stoop. He tosses an empty can into the bushes and gets to work on his fourth beer. He looks over at a parked Hyundai Elantra. A YOUNG MAN sits in the passenger seat with a pensive look on his face. He makes a sudden, surprised gasp. The homely YOUNG WOMAN who was just blowing him sits up from his lap and rearranges herself in the driver seat. She leans over for a goodbye kiss. The Young Man obliges with much fanfare. The Young Man gets out and the car pulls away. This is CHET (25), a clean cut guy dressed in the Gap Premium Collection. He heads toward the building, high off his BJ, humming Outkast's "Ms. Jackson." He stops when he notices Will in the shadows.

	What the hell? Have you just been sitting there?

	Hey, a nice girl decides to pleasure me on a weeknight, in her car no less...I'm not gonna make her feel like an untouchable. I'm gonna make her feel like a lady.

	What manners. May I offer you some alcohol, sir. To wash the taste of yourself out of your mouth.

Will offers his beer. Chet takes a slug, gurgles for effect.

<CHET>

	By the way, she said she had a friend. Maybe we can go on our first double date since you tried to talk Jackie Fortunato and her cousin into having a four-way with us.

Will shakes his head, turns and walks off. INT. STUDIO APARTMENT - DAY Will wakes up, legs dangling over the edge of a tiny couch. His TV is still on, displaying the menu screen from a porn. Will looks down at his coffee table. Clears some magazines to reveal a file folder. Flips the cover - It's full of college applications, drafts of admissions essays, a junior college transcript. Will thumbs through one of the glossy applications. The kids look young. Very young. Will glances over at a picture on his wall: he and Chet at high school graduation, looking just as young. They have their arms around a pretty girl squeezed between them. Will and the girl look very high and very happy. Will shuts the folder, slides it back under the coffee table debris. He looks over at a clock: it is already 2:00 PM.

</JAY>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What we have here is a classic "lesser of two evils" debate. You got one evil: me shaving a few years off The Major's shitty life. Then you got the other evil: The Major ruining my entire awesome life by blowing through my inheritance. Maybe I'm biased, but mine sure as shit seems like the lesser.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>

	I guess I...sorta see where you're coming from. And you have been waiting around forever for that money. You deserve it, Dwayne.

<DIRECTION>
Dwayne nods, seriously.
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, there's a reason I sleep 'til noon everyday. And it ain't 'cause I'm lazy. It's on account of me having so many goddamn dreams. Big ones. And once that money's mine, they're all gonna come true.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne takes a long sip of beer, contemplative.
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like I had this one dream last night. I was cruising through town in a Lamborghini Diablo. The wind was blowing through my hair, ruffling my open shirt. There was a hot little piece of ass sitting next to me. And in the back seat, Jay...was you. Strapped. Wearing a pair of Oakleys.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow. I didn't know you dreamt about me, Dwayne.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAY>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was only this once, Jay. To be honest, I didn't know what to make of it. So I consulted my dream book, and found out it means this: you're my road dog. You got my back. That's why I want to make you my partner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAY>
<DWAYNE>

	In crime. And business. You see, it ain't just about the inheritance money. It's about what I'm gonna do with it.

Dwayne leans across the table.

<DWAYNE>

<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. I'm totally ready.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAY>
<DWAYNE>

<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's also the perfect front for a prostitution ring.

<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, of course. Because of the booths.

Jay looks conflicted. Dwayne goes dark, like a spurned lover.
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm starting to wonder if my dream book was wrong about you. Maybe you sitting behind me doesn't mean you're my road dog. Maybe it means you're plotting to stab me in the back, like some snake in the grass.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's crazy. I'd never do something like that. The dream book was right!

<DIRECTION>
Jay looks Dwayne in the eyes, knows it's all or nothing...
</DIRECTION>
<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ok. I'll do it. But I'm not shooting him or anything. I'll hold him while you shoot him. That's it.

</JAY>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne chuckles.
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's a fact: they don't build prisons for criminals, they build them for idiots. Shit, they got three different types of CSI on TV, just laying out how the police do their business...and still, idiots like you think you can just go out and do a murder yourself.

	What? Why would you do that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAY>
<DWAYNE>

	I was presented with an opportunity. I took it. 100 thousand bucks for a highly trained assassin is a steal.

	<DIALOGUE>
	But we don't have that kinda money.

</JAY>
<DWAYNE>

	Yeah, I mean...camel jockeys do it in caves. I got a garage workshop.

	<DIALOGUE>
	20.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's just one problem. Where do we get our guy? 'Cause if we do a kidnapping, then we're right back where we started...doing shit that's gonna get us caught.

</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The point I'm trying to make is this: Tom Small was an asshole. He was totally wrong for your sister. Just like every other guy she's ever dated. Right through to that Mark dude she's gonna get back together with. Un-be- fuck-me-lievable...

<DIRECTION>
Will checks the address, then drives through the open gate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RADIO TOWER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Mustang parks at the end of the driveway. Will gets out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a large storage shed and, across a clearing, a radio tower built on top of a small office structure.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	27.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The office door is ajar. Florescent light glows from inside.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello?

</WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	DWAYNE
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) (calling back from beyond door)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, bud! Sorry for the hike! The county's got us doing repairs at the ass end of the night!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
This puts Will at ease. He heads toward the office. As he gets close, a figure appears in the doorway. It is Dwayne
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WEARING A SCARY FUCKING GORILLA MASK
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the -
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Will hears something behind him and whirls around -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
To find Jay, also in a gorilla mask, charging at him.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holy fuck!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Will makes a run for it. But the guys are on top of him in no time. He madly fights them off and dashes for his car.
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop! We got a gun, you asshole!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
Will breaks toward the cover of the shrubbery.
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck! Get him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
Jay is right on Will's tail. Without breaking stride, Jay picks up a large branch and wings it at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will is hit in the legs and stumbles over himself. Jay leaps on top of him and locks his skinny legs around Will's body.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell!?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(at a loss)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rape!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Jay wrestles something from his pocket. A chloroform soaked rag. He presses it hard against Will's mouth and nose. Will soon goes limp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne appears, looming above them. He pulls his gorilla mask back and smiles.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	28.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Step one.

CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blurry vision coming into focus. Two gorillas.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RADIO TOWER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Whereas the masks looked scary at night, they look ridiculous now. Will is propped up on the hood of his car, staring at his captors. His mouth is duct taped, hands bound behind his back. He wears his "Giorgio's" cap and a buttoned up olive green Army jacket.
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You thought we were gonna rape you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(CHUCKLES)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Idiot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
Will mumbles something through the duct tape.
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just shut up. The tape is there for a reason. 'Cause this next part is gonna take a measure of calm. Are you with me? Can you be calm?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
Will nods. Dwayne holds up his driver license.
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will Dixon, of 112 North Whatever- The-Fuck Street, right now you are wearing an explosive vest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
Will looks down at the jacket he is wearing, tries to get his hands loose so he can tear it open.
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Calm the fuck down!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
Will stiffens. For emphasis, Dwayne reveals the gun tucked down the front of his pants like a big metal cock.
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now stay still and my associate will show you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
Jay carefully unbuttons the Army jacket. Will is, in fact, wearing an explosive vest. It is a cobbled together but intimidating looking contraption, crisscrossed by multicolored wires. There is a thick lock at the hinge, with a digital display and a keypad.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will begins to hyperventilate.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	29.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take it easy, man. You're fine. I built this thing. It's pretty stable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAY>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For a fucking bomb. So don't trip over your shoelaces or anything. That thing's full of C-4. And the C is for chaos.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, the C stands for "composite." But, yeah, I'd try not to slam into stuff.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAY>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I take that tape off now, pizza boy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
Will nods. Dwayne rips the duct tape off his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne chuckles.
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know where you are? You might as well be in space, motherfucker. Nobody can hear you scream.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are you doing this to me? I don't have any money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not yet. But you're gonna go get us some.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Sure, man. Whatever you say. I'll go sell my car. I'll get you like a thousand bucks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want 100 thousand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where the fuck am I supposed to get that much money?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Donner-Wells National Bank on Charles Road. 30.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Across the street from the Olive Garden.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAY>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, the one across the street from the Olive Garden.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you guys have an account or something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne shakes his head like Will is an idiot.
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I don't have an account! You're gonna rob it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How the fuck am I supposed to rob a bank?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Figure it out. You got a bomb strapped to your chest. That's a start. It'll scare the fuck outta people. Maybe use your brain and go get a gun. Borrow one from a friend for all I care. It ain't rocket science.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then do it yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would, but I'm already wearing this gorilla mask and you're already wearing that bomb.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(TO JAY)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell him about the vest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
Jay turns to Will.
</DIRECTION>
<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You seem like a pretty trustworthy guy. I mean, you got a job and all. But just in case you were gonna try to take the vest off, we booby trapped it to shit. There's also a remote detonator on the back, so we can trigger it by dialing a number.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAY>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And it's on speed dial. So do what you gotta do, but we'll be watching. You go anywhere near a police station, and Fourth of July comes early this year.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne nods at the timer on the side of the vest.
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's 9:00 AM. You got 8 hours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
He hands Will a slip of paper.
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Once you have the money, call this number and you'll be given instructions on where to drop it. You do good, we give you the six-digit combination that stops the timer and opens the lock. Tomorrow morning, you can go back to delivering pizza, the mail, whatever the fuck you want.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(BEAT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now let me demonstrate what happens if you don't get us the money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne looks over to where an oversized stuffed bear, rigged with its own bomb vest, sits on a tree stump 20 yards away. Dwayne mimes answering a phone -
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Teddy Ruxpin...what's that? You don't have the money? It was too tough to rob the bank, so you just went back to your bear cave and cried like a bitch? Well, guess what my stuffed friend...time is up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
Jay pushes a button on a detonator. Teddy Ruxpin explodes. All that remains is a cloud of stuffing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will is frozen in fear.
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I liked that bear. I don't even know you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne throws Will his car keys.
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go on. Get outta here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guys, can we please just talk about this? 32.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, of course we can.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne pulls out the gun and fires two shots at Will's feet. Jay jumps backward, as does Will, who hits the hood of his car, slides across it and onto the ground by the driver side.
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be careful!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
Will awkwardly gets to his feet and arranges himself in the car, adjusting to the weight of the bomb. As he starts the engine and backs away -
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right! Get the fuck out of here! You're wasting time!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
Once the car is gone, Jay yanks off his gorilla mask. Dwayne stays primate.
</DIRECTION>
<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell, Dwayne? You told me that was a replica gun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAY>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was. Then I paid a Mexican 50 bucks to put a firing pin in it. Now it goes boom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We didn't discuss a loaded gun! Especially not with the bomb around!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAY>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne gets right in Jay's face. The plastic eyes of his mask betray no emotion.
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you ever question me. I'm fucking this bitch. You're just holding the camera.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<JAY>
<DIRECTION>
(VOICE FALTERS)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, Dwayne...whatever you say.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAY>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. 'Cause this ain't the Marines. This is cash money. You hesitate, you fuck up...and I will leave you behind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
A tense beat. Dwayne pulls his mask off. He looks oddly calm.
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go get some breakfast. 33.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will's car flies down the road. It screeches to a stop, tires smoking. Will jumps out, stumbles to the shoulder and pukes. He drops to his knees.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, god! Holy shit! Fuck me! Someone please fucking help me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing but the wind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will fights back tears. He gets to his feet, wipes his mouth. He takes out his cell phone, scrolls through the contacts. He pauses on Chet's name...presses send.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The line goes to voicemail. Will looks at the bomb's timer: 7 hours, 47 minutes and counting. He hurries to his car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CLASSROOM, JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A laser dot dances around the middle of a United States map.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chet is teaching a history lesson to a bunch of SEVENTH GRADERS that look very mature and very bored. As he indicates with his laser pointer -
</DIRECTION>
<CHET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This whole region here, about 830 thousand square miles, was part of the initial Louisiana Purchase.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHET>

(COUGHING)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice laser.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEVENTH_GRADER>
<DIRECTION>
The class giggles. Chet, embarrassed, puts away the pointer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a knock at the door. Chet turns to see Will's face in the door's window pane. He looks back to his class.
</DIRECTION>
<CHET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take out your workbooks. Chapter 3.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHET>
<DIRECTION>
Chet opens the door.
</DIRECTION>
<CHET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you want?

</CHET>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We gotta talk.

</WILL>
<CHET>

	I'm working here. Do not mess with me at work. 34.

Chet shuts the door behind them. Will paces.
</DIRECTION>
<CHET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wanna apologize, don't you? You look like shit. You've probably been up for days thinking about what an asshole you were. Well, it's gonna take a lot more than some pathetic groveling -
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHET>
<WILL>
<DIRECTION>
(SUDDENLY)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chet! Shut up! I don't wanna apologize to you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<CHET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then what do you want? Because we don't have anything left to say to each other.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHET>
<DIRECTION>
Will swallows hard.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here goes. And this is gonna sound crazy. Because it is fucking crazy. But last night two guys in masks jumped me and strapped a bomb to my chest, and now I have less than eight hours to rob a bank.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Chet just stares at Will, unimpressed.
</DIRECTION>
<CHET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're hysterical. Got me. Great joke. I'm going back to work now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHET>
<DIRECTION>
Will steps in Chet's way. He unbuttons his jacket, revealing the bomb.
</DIRECTION>
<CHET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the fuck? Is that real?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHET>
<DIRECTION>
Will nods.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	35.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Chet jumps backward, stumbles over a desk and scurries on his ass to the other end of the classroom. He presses himself flat against the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<CHET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay away from me! What the fuck are you involved in!? Terrorism!?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHET>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chet, do you really think I'm a terrorist?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<CHET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes! One of the dumb ones! The ones they convince to wear the bombs!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHET>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am not fucking around here. Two guys did this to me. And if I don't rob that bank in time this thing is gonna blow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<CHET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seriously?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHET>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seriously.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<CHET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And your first idea was to come to a school filled with young children?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHET>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't -
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<CHET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just back the fuck away from me with that thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHET>
<DIRECTION>
Will backs all the way up, so that the guys are on opposite ends of the classroom.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, I think the vest is safe for now. These guys don't want me to blow myself up on accident before I get their money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<CHET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, so you figure the two psychopaths that rigged a bomb to your chest made sure it was safe? There's no margin for error in their fucking bomb vest design!? 36.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHET>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know! All I do know is that this is real. This is happening. And I'm sure you hate me as much as I hate you right now, but I have nowhere else to go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<CHET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHET>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For help, Chet. I need your help. Please. I can't do this alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Chet looks Will over. His desperation is palpable. Chet bites his lip, weighing the situation...
</DIRECTION>
<CHET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn it!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(takes a breath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like to tell you to get fucked, but you know what the problem is...I'm a better man than you. And someday, I might actually forgive you. So if I let you blow up, or whatever, that shit might come back and eat at my conscience, and totally affect my relationships with other people. Like my wife and kids and shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHET>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a...very rational way to look at the situation.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(GENUINELY)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you're right, about being a better guy than me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Chet takes a step toward Will.
</DIRECTION>
<CHET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you sure that thing isn't gonna blow at any second?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHET>
<DIRECTION>
Will just looks at Chet...unable to offer any assurance. After a beat -
</DIRECTION>
<CHET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could you just walk a few feet in front of me for a while?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHET>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can do that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Will opens the door, stops, looks back at Chet.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	37.
	</DIALOGUE>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.

Will heads out. Chet takes a breath, bracing himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY, JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will walks down the empty hallway. He glances back over his shoulder, where Chet walks several feet behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<CHET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I'm still here. I really am this stupid. Just pay attention to where you're going.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHET>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I can handle it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<CHET>

	These floors get waxed once a week. On Tuesday, which today is. You hit a slick patch, trip and fall, and I got a classroom full of kids wearing their skin inside out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHET>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chet, I'm fucking nervous enough as it is. Please. I don't need you back seat driving me right now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<CHET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Obviously.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHET>
<DIRECTION>
Will stops, turns back toward Chet.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just for the record, this isn't a nuclear weapon strapped to my chest. And there are metal lockers on either side of the hallway. If I fall, and if this thing goes off, I'm probably not taking out the whole school.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<CHET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you really want to debate this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHET>
<DIRECTION>
Will sighs, turns back around. A second later, the school bell rings and kids flood the hallway, changing classes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will freezes. Multiple kids shove past him. Chet sweats bullets, gives Will a look of death.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a beat, the hallway empties again.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	38.
	</DIALOGUE>
<CHET>

</CHET>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever. It's over.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Will continues walking. He tries to lighten the mood -
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who was the chick in the white jeans?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<CHET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kristi Evans. Why?

</CHET>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know why.

</WILL>
<CHET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, come on. Just keep walking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHET>
<DIRECTION>
The guys' voices fade as they continue down the hallway...
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on yourself. You knew exactly who I was talking about.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<CHET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck you. She's in the eighth grade.

</CHET>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I bet you love it when she calls you Mr. Chet.

The guys get to Will's car. Chet wraps up a call on his cell -
</DIRECTION>
<CHET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...thanks so much, Mrs. Davis. I'll call you after I talk to the doctor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHET>
<DIRECTION>
Chet hangs up. He is standing by the passenger door. He looks over the roof of the car at Will.
</DIRECTION>
<CHET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, this is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHET>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is what? 39.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<CHET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Once I step inside this car, I'm basically in a steel coffin with you and...that thing. And if it goes off, all they're gonna find in there are two charred bodies and pieces of a bomb. They'll assume we were driving to a government building to blow it up. It'll be all over the news. Next thing you now, some militia or Islam group is claiming us as members. My family will be humiliated.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHET>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll also be dead, in that particular situation, so it won't really matter.

Will heaves a frustrated sigh. Chet eases up.

<CHET>

The door is shut. Will sits on the toilet lid. He has the jacket off and we get our first complete look at the vest. The actual structure is composed of hollow metal tubes. The wiring that runs throughout the vest is messy and complicated, purposely so, to scare anyone out of fucking with it.
</DIRECTION>

Will is in the process of trying to contort his arm so he can slide the vest off...no luck.

</CHET>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can't. These guys said they'd be following me. And I don't have a clue what they look like. For all I know, they're outside right now. They see the cops show up, they blow the vest and cut their losses.

Will drops onto the couch and puts his head in his hands, fighting hysterics. Chet offers a stock reassurance -

<CHET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's gonna be okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHET>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it's not! I'm gonna blow up! That's way worse than getting stabbed or shot. At least some people survive that. No one survives being blown up. No one is ever like, "Yeah, I heard Steve got blown up, tough break, but how's he doing now? Is he still in the Rec basketball league?" No of course he isn't, 'cause there's nothing left of Steve except a stain on the wall and a pair of fucking high tops!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>

Chet looks on as his friend begins to sob. It's a crushing sight. Chet strides across the apartment -
</DIRECTION>
<CHET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pull yourself together!

- and attempts to give him one of those "get a grip" slaps. But Will flinches and Chet slaps him right on the ear.

	Ow! Fuck! I think you popped my eardrum.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<CHET>

	The movie?

</WILL>
<CHET>

	Yes. That movie is like a how-to guide for bank robberies. You just bust in. Masks. Guns. Move fast. Stick to the tellers and don't bother with the vault.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHET>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah...I guess it's pretty simple, right? And it's just a local bank. The Donner-Wells on Charles Road.

	That's really clever. No one ever said that shit to me before. Anyway, this is perfect. You know the whole layout of the bank.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<CHET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not exactly. They didn't hand me the security schematics with the application. But I sat in the waiting area for like 20 minutes. I know what the place looks like.

	Sure. I'm sorry...I'm sorry that my family was going through a rough patch and I was smoking a ton of weed and listening to the Wu Tang Clan all the time. And that I needed some extra dough to indulge my habit. Which, in hindsight, was probably just a cry for help. But you never even noticed.

	I shouldn't have stolen the ball. I knew it was wrong and I regretted it like the next day. I actually tried to buy it back but the guy wanted twice as much. I had to smoke even more weed just to get past the whole shitty incident. I guess that's why they call it a downward spiral.

Chet drops ungracefully to the floor, right beside a well maintained 1977 Datsun 240Z.

Chet hurries over and unlocks the side door. Will enters, hauling the Walmart bag of supplies. He goes right for a set of hooks on the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>

Will goes to the car and tries the handle. It's open. He scours the interior.

Will pulls the ski masks out of the bag, along with one of the freshly painted air pistols.

Will puts a ski mask on, then throws one to Chet. The door opens and MR. FISHER (60s) enters. Chet quickly pulls down his mask. It's backwards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will levels the pistol -
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	MR. FISHER Oh, Jesus!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Fisher braces himself against a wall. Chet fumbles to turn his mask around. Will affects a deep voice -
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are the car keys?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	MR. FISHER They're in my pocket! I'm just reaching in my pocket for the keys!
	</DIALOGUE>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quiet down and do it already.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Fisher reaches into his pocket and produces the keys. They jingle as he holds them out in his trembling hand. Will snatches them.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now listen, I don't want you to report this car stolen or anything until later tonight. Let's say 5 o'clock. 6 to be safe. 54.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	MR. FISHER Sure. Anything you say.

<DIRECTION>
Will seems unconvinced. He looks to Chet, who shrugs. Will turns back to Mr. Fisher and gestures violently with the gun -
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you fuck with us, I swear, I will...I will shoot your son. Taylor. I know where he works. At the fucking travel agency. He's the douchebag with the bangs.

Mr. Fisher hits a switch that raises the garage door. Chet grabs their stuff and gets in the passenger side. Will backs toward the driver side.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The car's insured, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Fisher nods.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>

	Okay. I feel better. Worse comes to worst, something happens to it, you can get a Honda. This thing doesn't even have airbags.

<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chet, as if it isn't apparent, I may die today. I'll probably die today. And if there's one small thing that's clear to me now, it's that I've wasted two and a half decades as a pussy, watching everything I want pass me by. I don't wanna peace out of this world as a pussy. I need to tell her how I feel.

	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A whole lot of shit. I'm sorry to do this to you, but I was afraid I'd never get the chance to tell you. And I know you have feelings for me, too. Maybe you feel for me the way you feel for a good friend, or - if the world fucking hates me - a brother. But what I hope is that you don't really know how you feel for me, and that maybe when you figure it out you'll realize it's the same way I feel for you. Does that make any sense?

<DIRECTION>
Kate nods. Will hangs up the phone. She turns back toward the access door, stops. She yells across the roof at Will -
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>

	If I had time to think about it...I'd probably tell you that I've always felt very strongly for you. And I've never thought of you as a brother.

Chet picks out the most harmless looking teller, a mousy 20- something girl, and helps her up off the ground. He checks her name tag: SANDRA.

	Hey, Sandra. I know you're probably scared right now, but if you go grab us 100 grand in a bag, we'll get out of here. This will all be over and you'll be fine. You trust me?

Sandra hurries back behind the partition with Chet. He dumps out the contents of a trash can, grabs the bag and watches closely as Sandra stuffs it with cash.

Chet grabs the bag and hustles out toward Will. They are home free, until -

Just as a lone police cruiser screeches into the lot. Will and Chet make a run for it, but the cruiser cuts them off.

OFFICER ZURMAN (21), a jittery rookie, jumps out of the cruiser and levels his gun. The guys reflexively level theirs.

Will is wild eyed, punching the gas. Chet's head is on a swivel. Behind them: police cruisers in hot pursuit. Up ahead: the world rushing at them at 80 mph, populated by nothing but potential collisions that will result in a fiery death.

Will jumps the curb to avoid slow-moving traffic, slams into a newspaper dispenser. It flips up onto the hood and crashes into the windshield, where it stays lodged.

Will veers back into the street and blindly plows ahead as cars he cannot see swerve to avoid him.

He finally slams the brakes, the momentum knocking the dispenser loose and launching it onto the sidewalk, scattering Pedestrians.

Chet whirls around to see the cruiser flying right at them.

In the rushing moment as they cross the intersection, Chet glimpses the other cruiser barreling toward his side of the car from the perpendicular street. He has a millisecond, maybe, to process their impending doom, and then -

The cruiser smashes into the back passenger side of the car.

Will blinks back to reality. He's hanging, inverted, by his seat belt. The car is a pool of shattered glass. It twinkles up at him. Hours could have passed, but it's only been seconds. He sucks in air. Satisfied that he is, in fact, still alive, he looks over at -

Will emerges from the overturned car. He drags Chet out, along with the bag of cash. He glances up to see the OFFICER who crashed into them stumbling out of his own ruined car, which has turned a fire hydrant into a geyser. Another cruiser races to the scene.

INT. MCDONALD'S - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne and Jay sit at a table with a fast food feast spread out. Dwayne eats a Big Mac, a look of utter satisfaction on his face, a man whom the gods have finally smiled down upon.
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I remember the summer after my mother passed was the first year they had the Monopoly game at McDonald's. I musta come here three times a day trying to collect all the game pieces. Packed on 20 pounds, got acne from all the grease. The Major said I was the fattest, ugliest 13-year-old he ever laid eyes on. But I didn't care, I just wanted to win the money and get the fuck out of there. So, one night, I followed this skinny register kid home, jumped him. I kept whaling on him, asking him where they were hiding the Park Place piece. The million dollar prize. But he didn't know shit. A year later, The Major won the lotto. I asked him for a Sega Genesis. He bought me one of those paddles with the ball attached. 78.

</DWAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne goes for a fry, sees his carton is empty and grabs a handful of Jay's.
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not ashamed to admit that I've gone through some dark times since then. Depression. Addiction to a variety of shit, which I won't go into. I know you must think that's pretty silly, especially since you manage to get through the day and you don't got shit going on as compared to me. But that's just the way it is. That's life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
Jay looks pretty affected that Dwayne is opening up to him.
</DIRECTION>
<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, I've been pretty low, too... if you ever want to talk about that kinda stuff.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAY>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I don't. My whole point I was trying to make before you interrupted me was that that shit is all in the past. 'Cause I did it. I finally pulled it off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We pulled it off, Dwayne. The two us. We're a good team.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAY>
<DWAYNE>

Dwayne takes out his cell, keys in the speed dial code and slides the cell across the table to Jay.

</DWAYNE>
<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why would you want me to do that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAY>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's just a question, Jay. Would you? If I asked you? I mean, it's no different than those watermelons.

<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watermelons aren't alive.

</JAY>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DWAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne cracks a smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyway, he hasn't even made the drop yet. I'm gonna go take a shit. Stay away from the bathroom. Someone could get hurt.

Dwayne heads off. Jay eyes the cell phone he has left behind.

EXT. BOARDED UP GAS STATION - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Weeds have overtaken the abandoned place. Will leans against his parked car, waiting. Chet is nowhere to be seen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will spots Vaughn's Sentra approach. It pulls into the station and Vaughn steps. He could not look more menacing. Juicy hangs back in the passenger seat.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>

</WILL>
<VAUGHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't have any code.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VAUGHN>
<DIRECTION>
Vaughn turns to leave. Will grabs his arm. Vaughn stops, looks purposefully down at Will's hand. Will draws back.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, man, I just want the code.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<VAUGHN>
	<DIALOGUE>

Will opens his jacket. Vaughn takes a sudden step back.
</DIRECTION>
<VAUGHN>

<WILL>

</WILL>
<VAUGHN>

	Motherfucker, I don't know no goddamn code. Whoever told you I did, lied to you. Now step the fuck off, or I'll shoot you in the face so you don't explode and mess up my boots.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VAUGHN>
<DIRECTION>
Vaughn goes to leave again. Will runs ahead of him and gets in his way.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you don't have the code, I want that money back. 81.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<VAUGHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The only way you're getting this money back is if you kill me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VAUGHN>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't know what I've gone through for that money!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
In an instant, Vaughn has his gun out, aimed at Will's head.
</DIRECTION>
<VAUGHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do I look sympathetic? Now step the fuck aside.

Juicy looks on with interest as Vaughn holds Will at gunpoint. Then she spots
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BOARDED UP GAS STATION - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chet creeping up behind Vaughn, from wherever he was hiding, clutching a large metal pipe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Juicy jumps out of the Sentra.
</DIRECTION>
<JUICY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vaughn, look out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUICY>
<DIRECTION>
Vaughn whirls around toward Chet, just in time to have his gun arm smashed by the pipe. The weapon drops from his hand. Chet takes another swing, cracking Vaughn across the face. He howls, blood spraying, and topples over. Chet goes for another swing, when -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Juicy jumps on him, wildly biting and clawing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will grabs the back of Juicy's track jacket for leverage and flings her away. She hits the back of the Sentra and careens clear across the trunk.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Will grabs the money. Chet kicks Vaughn's gun into the bushes. The guys break for the Mustang and get in.

INT. JAY'S GARAGE WORKSHOP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A tidy space, filled with various half-finished devices, action figures and heavy metal posters. A low mechanical hum registers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne sits on a stool in the center of the garage, while Jay carefully trims his hair with an electric clipper. Dwayne holds up a mirror to check out his work.
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never comes out this nice when I do it myself. You might wanna take some more off the top, though. I wanna look real professional when I go down to the morgue to identify the body.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne's phone chimes from a nearby counter. He grabs it, looks at the incoming number, slightly concerned. He answers -

	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne is panicked, covers badly -
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I gave him the code. He told me he committed it to memory. He was probably just embarrassed that he forgot it. I'll call him up and -
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	WILL
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't give him shit! I want the code now or you'll never see this money!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold on there, big man. You got a bomb on you. I got a cell phone that detonates it. You're not exactly negotiating from a position of leverage.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	WILL
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm holding the money. I blow up, and it blows up. Who has the leverage now? Go ahead and push the button, you idiot.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Chet freaks out -
</DIRECTION>
<CHET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't tell him to push the button! Pull over! Pull over!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHET>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne is getting pissed off.
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you watch what the fuck you say! I own you! I tell you to rob a bank, and you rob a bank. I tell you to give me the money, and you give me the goddamn money and hope I show you some mercy.

The line goes dead. Dwayne tears off his haircut smock.

EXT. ROAD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chet jumps out while the Mustang is still slowing down. He runs 20 yards away. Will turns the car off and gets out.
</DIRECTION>
<CHET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was colossally stupid!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHET>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was a negotiation tactic. He'll call back and I won't answer. Then he'll call back and I will answer, and he'll realize the only way he gets the money is if he gives me the code.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<CHET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure! That seems like a perfectly logical pattern of thought! I bet that's exactly what he'll do!

</CHET>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JAY'S GARAGE WORKSHOP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne tries Will's phone again. It goes to voicemail. He explodes like a pack of Mentos in a two-liter of Diet Coke. Throws his cell across the room. Overturns a work table.
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does this guy know who the fuck I am!?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
Jay retreats into a corner. Dwayne's a big boy, and he soon tires himself out, hunches over, panting.
</DIRECTION>
<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dwayne...you never told me you weren't going to give him the code.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAY>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're not amateurs. He was a loose end. I let him live, someday I woulda been walking out of my mansion and... bam! FBI, CIA, NSA, all converging on my front lawn, 'cause a loose end turned state's evidence and they got what they need to put me away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>

Dwayne shakes his head. Starts digging through the mess he's made...finds his phone.
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>

Dwayne looks down at the send button.
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>

	You know what they say about a tree falling in the forest? Maybe the same thing applies to blowing up some motherfucker across town. Maybe it doesn't even make a sound.

<DIRECTION>
Dwayne hits send.
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>

But Dwayne notices something...the phone in his hand is ringing. He puts it to his ear. The line connects -
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	FEMALE VOICE
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello...who is this...hello...?

<DIRECTION>
Dwayne snaps the phone shut, looks to Jay, who tries to will the beads of sweat back into his pores.
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who did I just call, Jay? 'Cause she sounded cute for a bomb.

<JAY>

	</DIALOGUE>
</JAY>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm in perfect control!
	</DIALOGUE>

Dwayne charges Jay. Jay holds up the hair clippers like a weapon, flicks them on. Dwayne rips the cord out of the wall, uses it to yank the clippers from Jay's hand, then whips him with the cord.
</DIRECTION>
<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop it! 86.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAY>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne goes to whip Jay again, but Jay moves like a jack rabbit and delivers a fierce kidney shot. Dwayne stumbles backward, falls onto the couch, groans -

<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You asshole...I make you my partner and you pull this shit...

<JAY>

	I'm tired of you pushing me around all the time! What kinda partner does that!?

Dwayne's phone rings in his pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go on. Get it out for me. I can barely move.

Jay pulls the cell from Dwayne's pocket...opens it and puts it to his ear so he can answer -

<CHET>

	You offered.

As the guys continue to argue - SUPER COUNTDOWN: 1 hour, 28 minutes... CUT TO: INT. LAW FIRM, OFFICE BUILDING - DAY Kate walks down a hallway, turns into an office. Two figures rush past from the intersecting hallway and duck behind a corner.

Kate emerges from the office and continues into

INT. WOMEN'S BATHROOM, OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate goes to the mirror, checks herself out. She's been crying. She splashes water on her face, then enters a stall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bathroom door opens and Dwayne and Jay enter. Dwayne pulls something hairy from his pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside the stall, Kate reaches for some toilet paper...from underneath the barrier, she notices two pairs of dirty, masculine sneakers. Her breath goes shallow. She takes out her cell, quietly opens it. She presses the first 9 in "911," but her keypad volume is on and the phone makes a dull, electronic beep that echoes in the quiet bathroom.

	Why don't you just slide the phone under the door, so I don't have to kick it open and see you with your panties down. 91.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Kate slides the phone out. One of the sneakers crushes it. She gets off the toilet, arranges her clothing and steps out out of the stall. She gasps at -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two ominous men standing there in gorilla masks. Dwayne's gun is plainly visible, tucked into the front of his pants.
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the quietest way out of the building? 'Cause I might get excited in a confrontation, and you might wind up shot in the face.

EXT. LIVING ROOM, NICE HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Major is watching reruns of Three's Company. He doesn't laugh or remotely smile at any of it.

The subtle click of a door opening does not escape his finely tuned senses.
</DIRECTION>
<MAJOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dwayne?

Nothing. The Major gets up and goes to a desk, rifles through a drawer and pulls something out. A simple pen. He clutches it like a weapon.

<DIRECTION>
Vaughn shakes his head. Almost imperceptibly, The Major repositions the hand with the pen in it. Vaughn is about to squeeze the trigger -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But The Major beats him to it, clicking the pen, which is actually a pen gun. It fires a .22 caliber round into Vaughn's neck. He drops the gun and clutches the geyser of blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Major charges Vaughn, jumps on him and wrestles him to the ground, trying to jam the pen into the wound in his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<MAJOR>

Vaughn reaches for his gun. His fingers curl around it and he whips it across The Major's face, knocking him backwards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vaughn scrambles to his feet, gun pointed at the felled Major.

<VAUGHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What now, old man!? You can't kill me! None of y'all can kill me!

The Major goes limp, one searing hole in his chest.

Vaughn clasps a hand to his neck to staunch the flow of blood. He steps over the The Major's body and continues upstairs.

Vaughn rifles through the cabinets, dumps all of the first aid supplies into the sink. He gets to work on his wound.

INT. DWAYNE'S ROOM, NICE HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The locked door is kicked open. Vaughn, neck crudely bandaged, flicks on the lights and looks around the childish room. Chinese Fighting Fish swim in a large tank, seem to stop and look out at him like guard dogs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vaughn ransacks the place. He finds a desk drawer locked. Takes out his gun and blows it open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vaughn pulls a stuffed file folder out of the drawer. Flips through it. It's full of details about Dwayne's plan, the tanning salon, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<VAUGHN>
	<DIALOGUE>

</VAUGHN>
<DIRECTION>
He finds a map of the town in the file. Three locations are highlighted: the bank, the boarded up gas station, and the radio tower. PUSH IN on the radio tower.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vaughn stuffs the map into his pocket. He stops before leaving the room, turns and shatters the fish tank with the butt of his gun. Water spills out and the Chinese Fighting Fish flop onto the floor. As Vaughn lifts a boot to stomp them -

Will grips the bag close to him.

Dwayne whistles. The minivan door opens and Jay steps out. Strapped to his back is the frame pack we saw at his workshop. A long tube connects the pack to the handle of a metal pipe- like device in his hand.

Jay helps Kate, still bound and blindfolded, out of the van. They approach Dwayne and take up position behind him.

Will keys in the numbers. The timer freezes and the lock at the hinge opens. Will carefully extricates himself from the vest. He lays it down on the ground and steps away from it. His shirt is drenched in sweat from where the bomb sat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will takes a final look at the money bag, then throws it to Dwayne. He looks inside, smiles. Jay takes a peak.

Before Dwayne can react, he stops and blinks, something shining in his eyes.

Dwayne's eyes turn upward, just barely making out the red dot that dances on his forehead.

Will grins at Dwayne.

Without warning, Vaughn cracks Will over the head with the butt of his gun. He goes down hard. Kate screams. Vaughn points the gun at her and she shuts up.

Dwayne steps forward with the bag.

Dwayne complies. As soon as the bag lands, Vaughn aims the gun at him.

Vaughn's eyes burn a hole through Dwayne.

Panicked, Dwayne's eyes flash over to Jay, who tightens his grip on the flamethrower handle. Jay catches Dwayne's eye. Dwayne nods. Vaughn sees this.

Jay rears up with the flamethrower. Vaughn couldn't be more surprised to see the device Jay is holding spit a massive ball of fire at him.

Vaughn dives to the ground, fires off two wild shots, one of

<WHICH>

Nails Dwayne in the shoulder, spinning him backward and knocking him off his feet.

Kate recoils in horror as: Vaughn scurries madly on the ground, intermittently firing, while Jay screams and tries to torch him with the 25-foot flame. A hand touches Kate's shoulder and she whirls around to find -

	Where's Will?

</CHET>
<DIRECTION>
Kate looks to the empty spot beside her where Will just was.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flames inches from him, Vaughn lines up a desperate shot -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Good news: the bullet only grazes Jay's side. Bad news: it keeps going and punches through the flamethrower backpack, which happens to be filled with gasoline, which happens to have an incredibly low flash point. So the spark from, say, a bullet, would cause

<DIRECTION>
AN ERUPTION OF FLAMES

They take off toward Will's car.

Dwayne groggily comes to...no SOUND, just a ringing. The first thing he sees: Vaughn storming toward him, god-knows- what spewing from his mouth. Vaughn levels his gun -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It doesn't make a sound for two reasons. The second being that it's out of bullets.

<DIRECTION>
Dwayne fumbles for his own hardware. Muzzle flash.

SOUND SLAMS BACK to the tune of Jay's screams. Dwayne looks over to see his friend in flames, flailing his arms and shrieking. Dwayne's head snaps to the other side, where he sees the Mustang's tires peel. He tears off his mask, frantically looks around. The money is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
Jay disentangles himself from the backpack, the source of the flames, but his clothes are now ablaze. In his frenzy, he somehow manages to string together two coherent words -
</DIRECTION>
<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dwayne! Help!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAY>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne gets to his feet as the Mustang roars down the driveway. He looks to Jay, then to his minivan. Dwayne's face: Two roads diverge in a wood. Which to take?
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goddamn it, Jay!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne sprints over to Jay, rips off his jacket and uses it to beat the flames down.
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop, drop and roll!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
Jay hits the deck. Dwayne continues fighting the flames, finally falls on top of Jay with the jacket spread and smothers the last of them out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jay looks up at Dwayne with puppy dog eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You came back for me...you said you never would.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAY>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't hesitate back there, Jay. You did good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
Jay smiles. Flames overtake the field all around them.
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm gonna go put a bullet in that motherfucker and get our money. Think you can get outta here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Go get him. 103.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAY>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne hurries toward the minivan. Jay stumbles up to his feet and limps off toward the woods.

Will's face is a mess of dirt, sweat and dried blood. He and Chet stare ahead, completely shell-shocked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate looks from one of them to the other.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh...I just got kidnapped.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<CHET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, that was totally Will's fault. In case you want to factor that in while you're mulling over the whole relationship thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHET>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm very sorry about the kidnapping. This is me, taking responsibility for it. Growing up. Like a viable life partner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<CHET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This man has spied on you in the nude before!

<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? No, I didn't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<CHET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's lying. He's trying to build a relationship on a foundation of lies. And it won't stand.

Something catches Will's attention: a set of headlights rapidly growing larger in the rear-view mirror.

Will looks over at Dwayne, who pulls out his gun and takes aim. He flashes a sick grin -

	I own this town.

</DWAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
Before Dwayne can get a shot off -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An explosion rocks the minivan from inside. The back end is lifted off the ground and the car tumbles over itself. It lands on its roof and skids into a ditch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT - MOVING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chet and Kate watch the burning wreck disappear out the back window. They are equal parts confused and happy to be alive.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell was that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was the bomb I carried around all day. I reactivated it and put it in the back of his van. I guess his time was up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<CHET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"His time was up?" Were you thinking that up the whole day?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHET>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was prepared, yes. I can't help it if I'm the kind of guy who thinks about the future. 105.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<CHET>

(TO KATE)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's not that kind of guy. He doesn't think about the future. Ever.

</CHET>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What exactly happened since I saw you this afternoon?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Primarily, we robbed a bank.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What!? So you're, like, fugitives? What do we do now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<CHET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, Will. What does the future hold?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHET>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing good if we stay in town and they pin this on us. Kate, I think you should put in for that vacation time. Right now. If anyone gives you a problem, tell them to fuck off. There's 100 grand in that trash bag by your feet. A third of it's yours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Kate opens the bag...smiles through the dirt and grime.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will, that's -
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<CHET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fucked up. Why does she get a share?

</CHET>
<WILL>

Chet stews. Will catches Kate's eyes in the rear-view.

EXT. DITCH - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wind fans the flames of the burning minivan. The shattered windshield sprouts another crack...then another, as -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne's foot kicks it out. He drags himself from the smoldering steel carcass. He is a charred, blood splattered mess, but he is alive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne is propped up against a sign, lingering on the edge of consciousness. The headlights of a lone pickup truck approach. Dwayne feebly waves the truck down for a ride.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NICE HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens and Dwayne stumbles through. He has made it home. He drops like a puppet whose strings have been cut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From where his head has landed on the floor, Dwayne sees something odd...long red streaks. He crawls forward on all fours to investigate...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a trail of sticky red blood. Dwayne follows it until he comes upon its source...the crumpled body of his father, lying face down. Dwayne's face: shock and confusion and joy.
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne inches closer, pokes the body. Nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad, are you -
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
The body emits a low groan. Dwayne rolls it over. His father's face is white, he's lost a lot of blood, but he isn't totally spent yet. He struggles to speak -
</DIRECTION>
<MAJOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dwayne...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAJOR>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened to you?

</MAJOR>
<DWAYNE>

	I am a man! I killed you, didn't I? Now I'm gonna use your money to open a tanning salon where they let you fuck the chicks.

This stirs something in The Major.
</DIRECTION>
<MAJOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean...like those whorehouses...in 'Nam...I used to tell you about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAJOR>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne softens at the recollection.
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those were great bedtime stories.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
The Major nods. Opens his hand. Reveals a cordless phone. Dwayne looks to the bloody streaks down the hall, leading to the phone table. The Major dragged himself the whole way.
</DIRECTION>
<MAJOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Medics are late...probably a couple lazy spicks...you tell 'em I said so...all right, son?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAJOR>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure thing, pop.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>

The Major looks up at Dwayne's bruised face, as if for the first time.
</DIRECTION>
<MAJOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hell of thing...I think I may...actually respect you now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAJOR>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne's eyes well up. He reaches out, cradles his father as he expires. It's like a very bloody, white trash version of the Pietà. Dwayne sobs uncontrollably, until -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He drops his father and pound-pound-pounds his chest in some approximation of a life saving resuscitation.
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get up, you pussy! Come on, soldier!

</CHET>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But nothing about us?

<CHET>

	Nope. Guess it's time to head back.

</CHET>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. And it'd be easier if you gave us five fucking minutes alone.

Chet stares out at the ocean for a beat.

Will heads up a trail that leads to a hotel bungalow. Kate opens the door, steps out onto the porch.
</DIRECTION>

Will stops, looks back at Chet. He whistles. Chet turns.

<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're Riggs! You always have been!

Chet smiles, shakes his head as -

Will reaches the porch. He stands close to Kate. His nerves clock overtime.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I lied and told your brother I kissed you. I thought it would make this easier.

</WILL>
<KATE>

	Here's an idea: pretend you have a bomb strapped to your chest. Tick,

Will closes the gap and kisses her. After a beat -

<KATE>

</KATE>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Probably. We should go inside. I promised him I'd satisfy you.

But they are pushed to one side of the screen, as the other side is filled with -

A lo-fi, 2001-style light tunnel. It deposits us in the furthest reaches of the galaxy, where we find -

A tanning bed. Rotating in orbit. Dwayne's voice booms and

<DIRECTION>
The tanning bed explodes, like a star gone supernova. From the light and fire and chaos...emerges a logo:
</DIRECTION>
<MAJOR_TAN>

A bad MATCH CUT takes us to the same logo. Camera ZOOMS OUT unsteadily to reveal it is a banner above a strip mall storefront. We are watching a local commercial with appropriately poor production value.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MAJOR TAN - DAY (LOCAL COMMERCIAL)

Dwayne walks backward down a hallway while addressing camera and trying not to trip -
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here at Major Tan, our specially trained technicians are hard at work developing new technologies that harness the power of the sun, to ensure a cutting-edge tanning experience.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne enters a tanning room. A man in a lab coat stares down at a clipboard, on which a complicated scientific equation is written.
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's it looking?

</DWAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
The man turns: it's Jay. His smiling face is speckled with healing burn wounds.
</DIRECTION>
<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's our most advanced tanning bed yet!

</JAY>
<DIRECTION>
He gestures to a very ordinary looking tanning bed.

<DWAYNE>

	Hey, don't just take this scientist's word for it. The proof...

Dwayne snaps his fingers. A BAD SPECIAL EFFECT makes him disappear, then reappear with a totally orange tan.
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...is in the tan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
We follow Dwayne back out into the hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But Major Tan isn't just about looking good. It's also about feeling good.

Dwayne gestures to another room. The door opens and Juicy saunters out in a bikini. A beat later, a RANDOM GUY exits.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL...The Major beside Dwayne. He's only about four feet tall now, on account of the wheelchair. But he's grinning like a jackal, in a POW-MIA cap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SUPERED LOGO appears: Military Discounts Available!

<DIRECTION>
As father and son smile and wave at us -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
END COMMERCIAL.
