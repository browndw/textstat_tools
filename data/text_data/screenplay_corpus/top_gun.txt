EXT. NIGHT. - THE PACIFIC IS ANYTHING BUT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WINDS HOWL. Rain drives horizontal. The sea surges up, nearly to the flight deck of the Aircraft Carrier USS Kitty Hawk. The carrier plunges, driving its bow into a wall of grey water. The deck pitches forward and back, rolls left to right, and yaws in a corkscrew motion. The entire 93,000 ton behemoth rises and falls in the TYPHOON-DRIVEN SWELL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOMETHING DROPS DOWN OUT OF THE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A ROAR. Silver wings flash by, a cockpit, fiery jet exhausts. A forty ton monster drops at 120 knots into an area the size of a tennis court in a CONTROLLED CRASH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SHOWER OF SPARKS, A SCREECH OF RUBBER AND METAL as the gear hits the deck. The hook catches the 3 wire and the F-14 TOMCAT is slammed to a halt. It's the scariest thing you've ever seen, the most dangerous maneuver in aviation and just another day at the office for a Naval Aviator.

EXT. THE TWILIGHT'S LAST GLEAMING - (AERIAL)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We float like gods, above the storm, above the cloud cover, looking down. From overhead, a probe slides into frame, then a graceful nose. The cockpit sides by, Pilot, then Radar Intercept Officer (RIO) barely illuminated by the orange glow of their instruments. The fuselage gracefully swells to two enormous air intakes, then variable angle wings, swept back for high speed flight. Twin tailbooms cant outward, horizontal stabilizers make constant adjustments. Enormous twin jet exhaust ports glow red in the moonlight.

Cougar lies alone in the dimness, staring at the overhead.

03 LEVEL - BELOW DECKS - OFFICER'S COUNTRY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The usual CLANGS, WHISTLES, ENGINES of Navy life sound FORLORN ECHOING through the dim, deserted passage. From the distance, a single figure passes in and out of the glow of the overhead lights. Cougar comes closer, hobbling unsteadily.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches a door, pulls himself erect and knocks on the sign:

Stinger moves slightly, to stand now, directly in front of Maverick and speak eye to eye at four inches.

<STINGER>

	You just did an incredibly brave thing! What you should have done was land your plane. You don't own that plane, the taxpayers do. I should ream you out for it. But it just doesn't work with you. You're a hell of a flyer. You are maybe ...too good. You never really stepped in it yet. So this is your chance. I'm gonna send you up against the best. They are better than you. Maybe they'll knock that shine off your eagle and you'll see, finally, where discipline and teamwork fit it. Maverick hasn't really heard anything but TOPGUN. He snaps out of it.

<DIRECTION>
Maverick and Goose push through a gauntlet of aircrews. They have become notorious. Guys grab at them...questions...the MiGs?..What happened up there? How close did they get? What did the MiGs do? One word is heard over and over..."TopGun". Goose is left behind in the crowd. Maverick pushes through. He walks fast...faster. Up ladders, around turns, down ladders, through passageways. Faster. He breaks into a trot, then a canter, squeezing past enlisted men, parts lockers, then he breaks into a run...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT - CARRIER - NIGHT AND STORM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hatch slams open on the side of the Carrier. He's out on a catwalk, instantly soaked, running on rain slicked stairs cantilevered high over the breaking seas. He plunges forward to the bow of the ship, stands on the very peak. He is yelling something. He stands there as the bow plunges terrifyingly into the trough. The water rises like a green mountain, up, up to break just a few feet below him, showering him with spray. The noise is incredible.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Come around on his face. It is maddened. He raises his fist and punches the night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The foaming slope of the wave rushes up, changing color as it DISSOLVES TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Desert Sand whipping by...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOJAVE DESERT - 1 WEEK LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A big bike, a real big bike, a turbo...rockets across the desert. Fast. Real fast. Aviator shades low above the handlebars --Maverick. Goose hangs on in back. It cranks faster, pulls closer...ENGINE SCREAMING. It cranks up a notch, it's going to
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
explode. It can't go faster, but it does. It SCREAMS HIGHER. It ROARS under, by and away, leaving dust...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BIKE - STILL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. Just the HISS AND POP OF METAL COOLING. Maverick sits on it, staring out past us. Goose looks over Maverick's shoulder.

We see why. Feet come into the frame. Then the uniform: California Highway Patrol.
</DIRECTION>

COUNTRY ROAD - NEAR SAN DIEGO
</DIRECTION>

ANGLE ON MAVERICK. CHP enters the frame, the usual hypercivil arrogance tinged with awed disbelief. The usual questions are spaced for effect as if he might be talking to some other form of life. Maverick is off the bike, standing at attention. Goose follows more slowly.

EXT. MIRAMAR NAVAL AIR STATION - LATER

The bike is BLURPING... barely going fast enough to stay upright. Maverick cool in shades and campaign cap dorks past the hanger with the sign: FIGHTERTOWN, USA. He pulls ahead. In back of him, escorting with flashers...the CHP. They pull up at the gate. Maverick and Goose salute the guard, hands over their ID. The CHP gets out of his car, leans against the door.

He salutes. The CHP returns a snappy one. He gets back in his car and turns away. Maverick receives his ID and clearance. As he passes through, a couple of pilots in flight suits (ICE AND HOLLYWOOD) stare at him. The taller, dark, cool one speaks in a dry voice, meant to be overheard.
</DIRECTION>
<ICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh oh, police escort. This one must be a real killer.

Ice is not looking at the speaker, but, rather, in our direction. HOLLYWOOD, a blond, good-looking pilot, whispers something to him, and gestures. Ice is getting the lowdown on someone. The camera moves and we see who that someone is, as Maverick enters the frame.

	My answer is: the dangerous thing is being unprepared. You want trouble, that's what you get when things don't work out, when you can't do what you say you can. When you don't know what you can do. And when your opponents aren't sure either. We are not policy. We don't make policy. Elected officials ...civilians, do that. We are the instrument of policy. The tip of the spear. So we had best be sharp.

Maverick has turned to look at Ice. Ice glances back in his direction. Maverick looks at the back of the room where guys in blue flight suits stand. They are the instructors. They look relaxed, poised, mean. Goose is looking up front...Where Viper has stopped. Goose nudges Maverick.

Loud music, low ceiling, plaques of the squadrons line the walls. A dancer gyrates on stage, largely ignored by pilots talking with their hands. Every pretty girl in San Diego seems to be here. It's a noisy, rowdy place--a "steam releaser" for people under pressure. Nevertheless, there is a control to it all, there are none of the usual bar types, just pilots and Naval Officers.

The Ghost Riders enter. The place is on fire: a mob of dancers, flashing lights, blaring HARD ROCK MUSIC. Beer flows. Pilots talk flying and hustle girls.

Suddenly, behind them, a flame shoots up. Someone ducks his head and swallows it. The pilot sets an empty glass on the bar.

<SLIDER>

	What was that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SLIDER>
<GOOSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Flaming Hooker. Sort of an institution around here. Or maybe this is the institution, I forget which. It's the house drink. It'll warm the cockles of your heart ... and other things depending on where you spill it.

He motions to the barmaid and she moves over, sets them up. GOOSE holds a demitasse glass. The barmaid pours Drambuie. They look at Goose apprehensively. Goose looks at nearby flyers in Camo fatigues.

</SLIDER>

The others are duly impressed. Maverick's gaze falls on Ice watching from the end of the bar - Slider takes one, Maverick takes one too, downs it in a gulp. Sundown, taking up the challenge, motions for one. The barmaid pours it.
</DIRECTION>
<GOOSE>

<DIRECTION>
He tries to drink the flaming concoction. He tries to go for a sip, but it's too close to his face, he tries to tilt the flame away, but that doesn't work. Finally he goes for the gulp. He burns his lip and misses. He sets his hair on fire. It goes up in a WHOOOSH!!

Maverick smiles at this, but seems on edge... He watches a few pretty girls enter and eye the pilots in their flight suits, then turns and walks up to Ice, who sits, drinking with Slider. Maverick walks over to him. Ice notices Slider's attention going to Maverick. He turns and grins at him.

Something in the way he says it. It's not quite a joke, more an insult. Maverick's about to take the whole conversation too far when something...someone catches his eye. She catches quite a few eyes in this room. She is very pretty and she's walking in on the arm of a Commander. Maverick turns back, but the moment has passed. Ice dismisses him with a nod and weak smile. Goose pulls him away.

	We were just really diving down and by then we were right over downtown Haiphong. It was some great shit. Jack says, "What are you doing?" "What, what am I doing, Jack?"

Oh shit, goddamn it! And blowing down the river. And so once we were there we let down to about fifty feet just going down the river and Jack says... "Bugs... don't ever do that again!"

She has turned toward them. She passes by. They start to make a move for her. But just then she finds her date at the bar; a distinguished man with Captain's stripes. Their smiles freeze and they slide back in their chairs. Maverick can't stop looking at her...After a while, the intensity of his gaze draws her attention. She feels him. She is nodding and smiling to her date, but her eyes scan the room like radar. A warning tone goes off in his brain dolu dolu dolu as they lock on him. He feels that thrill of excitement and fear you get when you know you're targeted in someone's scope. Her eyes hold on him for a long moment...long enough, and then sweep by the rest of the room. She turns her attention back to the Captain and laughs at something he says.

He's half listening to Bugs rattle on. His eyes are drawn back to the woman. He tries not to stare. She seems to know a lot of people in the club. He looks away. Hollywood is chatting up a girl with a sincerity that cannot be taught. His line is just as polished as his appearance.

Maverick looks up at the bar again. A shock. She (Charlie) is staring right at him, intensely, as her date whispers something in her ear. She notices him, staring back, quickly looks away, embarrassed. She says something to the man. He nods and turns away as someone else grabs his attention. The woman, now wouldn't look this way for anything. She picks up her purse from the bar and walks through the crowd and out of the room. Impulsively, Maverick's up, he follows.

WOMEN'S ROOM.

<DIRECTION>
A feminine GASP! He should have looked at the sign on the door. The realization of where he is hits him too late. She is standing by the mirror, with her make-up out, looking back at him. He's not quite sure what to do. A hasty retreat would be appropriate, if embarrassing. Ah, what the hell, he is a fighter pilot! He just walks right over to her...no idea what he will say. She's got her lipstick out, twisting it. She looks over at him with an amused smile.

From a car in the parking lot, we see Charlie and the Captain leave the club. They walk directly toward us and stop. She turns, says something polite...a peck on the cheek. He turns away.

	Now to continue. In this class we will be dealing with F-5's and A4's, as our MiG simulators. Technically the F-5 does not have the thrust to weight ratio of the MiG-21--it also does not bleed energy below 300 knots like the MiG-21 does. The A4 does not turn as well as the MiG-17 but has significantly better visibility.

Maverick looks back to his notes. SFX footsteps...door opening. Viper looks up to back of room door.

Maverick turns to see the TAGREF walk forward. Maverick stares at her as she passes without acknowledging him. He is surprised, embarrassed.

<VIPER>

	</DIALOGUE>
</VIPER>
<DIRECTION>
She walks to the front and starts her presentation. She talks about something very technical, arcane. MiG tactics, technology. As the briefing rattles on, Maverick reacts to her. Goose glances over at him. He, too, recognizes the girl. He looks at his partner. Maverick feels his stare.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, I think I have some new data for you...Now a MiG 21 has a problem with the inverted flight tanks. It won't do a Negative G push over. Even below one G, they risk a flame out. Operationally, they will do a zero to one G only.

She smiles at him and walks away. Maverick turns, sees the others sizing him up. Most of them grin. Maverick moves down the corridor past the CO's Office. Viper leans against the

EXT. SKY - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At twenty-eight thousand feet, the two planes circle each other, going in opposite directions. As they jockey for position, they snap past each other like ends of bullwhips.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The earth spins, the horizon appears and disappears. With each hard turn, Maverick and Goose can be heard "grunting" to keep blood in their brains, to keep from passing out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fight is hard, physical, and exhausting. The extreme G forces--6.5--flatten them against their seats, causing their heads to weigh over one hundred pounds. Maverick strains to turn his head and track the other jet as it streaks past at Mach One.

<DIRECTION>
THE PLANE EXPLODES INTO AFTERBURNER - rocketing toward space. Jester is left in direct line with the sun, and his canopy is sprayed with a blinding glare. Going ballistic is dangerous. The plane flys like a bullet, obeying the laws of physics, not the pilot's touch on control surfaces. The ballistic call warns other aircraft that he is, for the moment, out of control.

The F-14 peels over the egg, in a backward dive. It rockets down the outside, gaining energy. Over the ROAR of jets, the SCREAM of the wind, Goose shouts data, but it is muffled, a distant voice in a typhoon. Through the canopy, we see Jester, and he hangs in the air like a sparrow in the path of a falcon.

Maverick is exhausted. It's been a long, rough day. His voice is a horse whisper.
</DIRECTION>
<MAVERICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had him in view. I was peeling over the egg, into a dive. He saw me when I moved in for the kill. There wasn't any danger...

Viper is not satisfied with the answer, but he moves on.
</DIRECTION>
<VIPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The hard deck for this hop was ten thousand feet. Jester, at what point did you call off the fight?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIPER>
<JESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just below ten thousand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESTER>
<VIPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you continued to fight.

Another pause, another grudging nod.
</DIRECTION>
<VIPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?

	We weren't below for more than ten seconds. There was no danger. I had the shot. I took it.

	<DIALOGUE>
	The rules of engagement are not flexible. They exist for your safety. You will obey them. Is that clear?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIPER>
<DIRECTION>
Maverick thinks about continuing the discussion, but the thought is momentary. He quickly cuts his losses, gives Viper what he thinks he wants...He is just on the cusp of too sincere.
</DIRECTION>
<MAVERICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes sir, perfectly clear. I guess we were ...I was... just a little over enthusiastic.
	</DIALOGUE>

Viper measures him for a moment, then lets it go.

<VIPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess you were. Dismissed.

</VIPER>
<DIRECTION>
Maverick and Goose leave the room. Viper looks at Jester, picks up Maverick's fitness report. Doesn't read it, looks back at Jester.
</DIRECTION>
<JESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know what to tell you, Skip.

Jester waits.

<VIPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...If you had to go into combat, would you want him with you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIPER>
<DIRECTION>
Jester turns, walks slowly around the room. The walls are lined with pictures; planes and pilots...history. There are MiG killers, attack squadrons, ground personnel...There's one picture of a Phantom in flight with the backseater mooning the camera. Other pictures show carriers, famous flyers, previous CO's. Finally Jester replys.
</DIRECTION>
<JESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESTER>
<DIRECTION>
Viper slaps shut the fitness report.
</DIRECTION>
<JESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's seat of the pants... Completely unpredictable -- nothing by the book. All over the sky. But I don't know, Skip, he's really got something.

COCKPIT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maverick flys the heck out of it. It's real. It lurches and bumps, the NOISES and sights look real. He gets on the tail of a MiG. It breaks, he breaks, then what he does is just too fast to follow. It screams around in a turn. Suddenly, there is a WHUMMP...ALARMS...the lights come on.

	The hottest moves in the world aren't gonna help you if you wind up alone. Your wingman's got to be able to follow you. Trust you. Know that he can depend on you. It's more than just fancy flying.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<MAVERICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, what you need...what you have to keep looking for...what you want to get is a wingman who can stay up with you. Who can match you move for move. Then you've got something. I'm sorry.

BEACH LA JOLLA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A day off. Pilots, other personnel are enjoying a day at the beach. There are bikinis, and beer, sunfishes and water skiing. The annual Over-the-Line (a variation of softball) tournament is in progress. The team from the Teddy Kennedy Driving School is whipping another known as Scum de Terre. The pilots are doing pretty well at blowing off steam.
</DIRECTION>

UNDERSEA

Undulating sea grass. Muffled HISS of the surf. A pretty fish comes into view. A spear shoots through it, and nails it to the ocean floor.
</DIRECTION>

SHORELINE

Two figures pop to the surface and wade in to the beach. Maverick holds the wriggling fish. Charlie is repulsed. She pulls off her mask and snorkle, follows him in to shore.. THE BEACH

Maverick looks up and sees the other two-man team, the victors, waiting on the other side of the net for them. Of course it had to be Ice and Slider.Charlie sits and watches as the game gets immediately out of hand. In moments, Maverick and Ice rotate to forward positions directly opposite each other across the net. Other revelers turn to watch as it degenerates (?) to more than a game. Maverick glances at Charlie. He seems uncomfortable, but irrevocably drawn into the confrontation. She says nothing, but her attitude is apparent. Back to the game: Slider and Goose set them up, as they try to spike the ball in each other's face. The final point...up over the middle. They both go up, Maverick smashes, Ice blocks, but the ball sails away, off his forearm. For the first time ever, Maverick beats him. He looks over at Charlie, she is staring out to sea. She looks back at him and he's suddenly had enough competition. They call for another game, but Maverick turns away...

	NO, NO, NO, HE'S MINE.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICE>
<DIRECTION>
Maverick is pulling a log of G's, but can't target his weapons, he continues to turn in a hard circle, going round and round without gaining. He can't bring his nose to bear.
</DIRECTION>
<MAVERICK>
	<DIALOGUE>

Ice stays.

<MAVERICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	COMING IN.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAVERICK>
<DIRECTION>
Maverick dives down between the two planes pulling 6.5 G's, exposing his underside to Ice. All Ice sees is belly. Obviously, in this attitude Maverick can't see him.
</DIRECTION>
<ICE>
<DIRECTION>
(under breath.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sonofabitch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICE>
<DIRECTION>
He slams the stick hard right in toward Maverick. Ice quickly rolls up right, in front of him.
</DIRECTION>
<ICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	LOOK OUT!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICE>
<DIRECTION>
Maverick sees him flash into his view. He has to slam the stick forward to avoid collision. He swings by real close. Too close.
</DIRECTION>
<GOOSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, no!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOOSE>
<DIRECTION>
They pass through Ice's turbulence. The blast distorts the airflow to Maverick's left engine. BOOMBOOMBOOM. The engine flames out. Full thrust on the right, engine swings the tail around in a yaw. Maverick slams the stick right to correct but too late.
</DIRECTION>
<GOOSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Plane's coupling up! Plane's coupling up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOOSE>
<DIRECTION>
The plane couples one yaw to the next--the tail swings around-- which becomes an ever increasing flat spin, like an out-of -control frisbee.
</DIRECTION>
<GOOSE>
<DIRECTION>
This is not good!...(Rising panic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're low!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOOSE>
<DIRECTION>
Maverick is pinned to the instrument panel by centrifugal force, desperately tries to reach back for the ejection lever--but is falling short by about a foot.
</DIRECTION>
<MAVERICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm pinned to the panel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAVERICK>
<GOOSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Time to go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOOSE>
<MAVERICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't eject.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAVERICK>
<DIRECTION>
The plane is spinning ever faster, out of control. He drops the gear. Still spins. Goose is closer to center of spin--G forces are less. He reaches behind him for the eject handle, starts the eject sequence.
</DIRECTION>
<GOOSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	3000 feet. I'll do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOOSE>
<MAVERICK>

	</DIALOGUE>
</MAVERICK>
<DIRECTION>
BOOM - A HURRICANE OF WIND AND NOISE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The canopy BLASTS away--but is held spinning above the cockpit by the vortex of the sinking jet. Goose glances up at it.
</DIRECTION>
<GOOSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	1000.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOOSE>
<MAVERICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go. Eject.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAVERICK>
<DIRECTION>
Goose yanks the ejection handle. Things happen in a split second. Goose is fired up and out by the rocket under his seat. Almost instantly he impacts the spinning canopy. A sickening CRUNCH. The canopy is knocked away. Maverick is slammed back in his seat as the ejection seat straps wind up. He is BLASTED out of the plane just before it spins in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON MAVERICK AS HE TUMBLES IN SLOW MOTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's in shock..the loud THUMPING of his heart, labored breathing, a scream that stays in his mind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Instinctively, he gropes for straps. He releases the pilot seat, it tumbles away. His chute streams, balloons open, snapping his body like a bullwhip. He drifts momentarily, then plunges into the sea.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNDERWATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His face, distorted in the water; wild eyes, disoriented, choking for air. He reaches out, finds nothing to grab. Suddenly, he is yanked hard to the side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SURFACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The parachute is caught by the wind, and dragged, pulling Maverick along beneath the surface. He is twisting in the water, turning over and over, trying desperately to slip out of the tangled straps. He finally hits the surface of the water and sucks air into his lungs. With the end of his strength, he hits the release snaps and breaks free from the parachute. It whips away like a kite in a typhoon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sea is choppy and rough. He struggles as his equipment drags him under. He twists, finds the inflatable raft attached to his harness. Maverick pulls the cord, and the raft hisses open. He pulls his body into the six-by-two foot raft and collapses, completely exhausted. The survival has been almost without thinking: an instinctual physical struggle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWILIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maverick begins to focus on the situation. He stains the water with dye, then sees another parachute floating nearby. Paddling to the parachute, he reaches over the side and begins to pull on the heavy cords that are submerged in the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A great struggle. The weight is extremely heavy. Finally, he pulls a body to the surface. Goose. Goose is dead. Maverick releases the parachute and pulls Goose into the raft on top of him. He holds Goose in his arms. His mind shuts down again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From high above the ocean, we see the debris on the water. An oil slick, pieces of honeycomb titanium, and the small, helpless figure in the raft.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Searchlights skim over the black ocean. A brilliant light flashes as Maverick pops a pencil flare. Helicopter blades flick powerfully. The lights of the choppers descend toward the wreckage area, scanning the debris, searching for life. The spotlights find Maverick and Goose in the raft.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The draft from the chopper churns the water. A FROGMAN drops from the chopper and hits with a heavy splashes. He surfaces and swims to the raft as a rescue harness is lowered.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maverick watches curiously as he starts to examine Goose. He hugs Goose closer and looks threatened.
</DIRECTION>
<FROGMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let him go, sir. Take it easy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FROGMAN>
<DIRECTION>
He tries to pry Goose free, but Maverick has a death grip on the body.
</DIRECTION>
<FROGMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir! Let him go. It's all right. Let him go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FROGMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Maverick glares at the man as he bobs in the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another long moment, then Maverick releases Goose. The frogman quickly straps Maverick into the harness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS POV. - He watches the lifeless body in the water as he is pulled up and away. He shivers from the cold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Extreme CLOSE ON Maverick's face. He is emotionless. His eyes are flat and absolutely without expression. There is complete silence in the room. Then we hear the quiet, calm, probing voice of Viper.
</DIRECTION>
<VIPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you feel?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIPER>
<MAVERICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right.

</VIPER>
<MAVERICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. I was there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAVERICK>
<DIRECTION>
Not one sign of emotion from Maverick. Not one tone of expression. We see Viper now, and his face is strained from a very long day.
</DIRECTION>
<VIPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you fly jets long enough, something like this happens to you. No one escapes it. It touches us all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIPER>
<DIRECTION>
Maverick looks at Viper, and his eyes are very disturbed.
</DIRECTION>
<MAVERICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was...my responsibility--my RIO.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAVERICK>
<VIPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My first squadron in Vietnam, we lost eight out of eighteen planes. Ten guys. The first one kills you, but there'll be others--you can count on it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIPER>
<DIRECTION>
No reaction from Maverick. He can't quite face up to that reality right now.
</DIRECTION>
<VIPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've got to put him in the box.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIPER>
<DIRECTION>
Maverick is watching Viper, but he doesn't have anything to say.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CHARLIE'S SPORTSCAR - NIGHT

The RADIO plays John Lennon; "Stand by Me". Maverick opens his eyes, doesn't know where he is for a moment.

Charlie's car pulls up. They get out and walk down toward the water. Maverick seems dazed. She is softly taunting.

She turns, nods out, past the moon.

	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what I want.

She turns and walks along the surfline.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>

He walks to the surf, kicks the sand with his bare feet.

	<DIALOGUE>
	If we knew then, what we know now, we might never have come up out of there.

He picks up a piece of flotsam, a twig, worn smooth.

	This too...shall pass. You put as much life as you can between it and you. You start piling up experience between then and now.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Strip reality! How do you play that?

<CHARLIE>

	It's like strip poker, only, without the bluffing.

<MAVERICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was my fault.

She says nothing, stands looking into his eyes. He slowly, as if in a trance, takes her blouse off.

	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't bring him back.

She takes off his shirt.

He starts to reach for her. She pulls back.

<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nope. Already used that.

She turns and thinks for a moment, looking at the moon.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your life goes on.

</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Rather than struggle his T shirt over his head, she grabs it with both hands. She leans in close and bites it. She grabs both sides of the tear and slowly rips it off his body.
</DIRECTION>
<MAVERICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What does it mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAVERICK>
<CHARLIE>

She drops her skirt.

She unbuckles his belt, slowly slides it off. She unzips his pants, they fall.

<MAVERICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One more.

<CHARLIE>

She unbuckles it.

He rests his head on her shoulder, unhooks her bra. She shrugs it off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They stand on the beach in shorts and bikini bottom, looking into each other's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looks like a tie.

</MAVERICK>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll say it together. On the count of three...One...two...

Leaning in, softer and harder...they both jump the gun.
</DIRECTION>
<BOTHTOGETHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love.ove y.you.

</BOTHTOGETHER>
<DIRECTION>
They embrace madly and sink to the sand. From the distance it looks like a strange slithering creature crawling back to the sea.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GOOSE'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lights are out in Goose's room at the Bachelor Officers' Quarters. The door opens, and Maverick enters. He sets a cardboard box on the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Silently, Maverick gathers together Goose's few personal possessions. He fills the box with clothes, books, a clock, a radio, a walkman, and articles from the bathroom. He examines each closely, like an artifact...as if he might find some message or meaning in them. He fumbles them into the box. He can't see too well, his eyes are full of tears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maverick closes the box and carries it to the door. He takes one last glance around, then leaves and closes the door behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BOQ RECEPTION AREA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carol and the kid, stand, staring at a silent TV. Carol looks dazed, lost. Maverick walks in, finds her. An awkward silence while they both try to think of something to say. Maverick hands the box to Carol.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP - MAVERICK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sits staring right through us...the thousand-yard stare. A strange white unreal light washes over him. The only color, the Navy and gold of the stripes on his shoulderboards. A low rumbling mumbling filters through the HISS of surf or fans or something...Snatches of low whispered conversation....disregard of...basic air-safety principles...too aggressive...incident.... 29 July...within performance parameters... disciplinary action...tactical doctrine.... even reckless at times... conjecture...unsupported ...benefit of the doubt...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maverick's eyes slowly focus. The light attenuates. The surrounding image becomes denser. Things become real.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY - MAVERICK'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BOARD OF INQUIRY, a COMMANDER and other NAVY OFFICERS seated behind tables at the front of the room. Maverick faces them, wearing dress whites. Viper is also present. The Commander looks at each of the Officers. They each nod, in turn, indicating readiness. The Commander turns to Maverick, and states for the record:
</DIRECTION>
<CDR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Board of Inquiry finds that Lt. Evan Mitchell was not at fault in the accident of twenty-nine July.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CDR>
<DIRECTION>
No response from Maverick, one way or the other. Viper studies his face with concern.
</DIRECTION>
<CDR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lt. Mitchell's record will be cleared of this incident.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CDR>
<DIRECTION>

INT. COCKPIT - F-14 ON FLIGHT LINE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maverick sits in the cockpit staring at the controls while the ground crew preps the aircraft for flight. Coogan helps him strap in. He speaks solicitously to Maverick. It is unheard over the JET NOISE and RADIO BABBLE. Maverick looks at the cockpit as if it's a strange territory, suddenly foreign to him. He grabs the stick like it's some peculiar talisman. He turns and looks aft. He seems surprised that it moves the control surfaces in the tails.

INT. TERMINAL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie hurries through the crowd, bumping past people, searching frantically for Maverick in the huge terminal. She moves past bench after bench, and her eyes flick in all directions. A quick glance at the souvenir shop, the coffee shop, and then she heads for the bar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maverick is there, sitting alone in a booth with his suitcase beside him, staring into a drink. Charlie composes herself, then walks to the booth and sits down across the table from him. Maverick does not look pleased.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>

<MAVERICK>

	</DIALOGUE>
</MAVERICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	CHARLIE I've got a gift just like you do. My gift is I just know what people mean, even if they can't say it. It helps when you're trying to communicate with fighter pilots. Like what you just said was "I'm embarrassed, I feel I've done something wrong, that I've failed, and I don't think I can live up to the expectations of a wonderful interesting, intelligent woman like yourself." That about it?
	</DIALOGUE>

<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, I never said I was a fighter pilot...I never claimed to think it was fun to be shot off the end of a ship in a storm. I can find contentment in a good book. I don't have to roar by someone at Mach two with my hair on fire. Sometimes...I just get happy being with the right man.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope you find him.

</MAVERICK>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I have... I could be wrong. I have been before. Just remember one thing. If you're not Top Gun, if you're not fighting jets, you're not gonna be able to act like a fighter pilot... You're gonna have to act like the rest of us. You're gonna have to master humility. For you guys, that's the toughest maneuver of all.

She swings away. Her wake sucks in the stares of every man in the place. Then they look over to Maverick, quick flicks of envy in their eyes. He stares them back and can't quite meet their eyes.

EXT. BEACH AT VIPER'S HOUSE - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Viper is tugged down the beach by a three year old kid. They come across one creature who's had a bad night...Viper spots him, he spots Viper, and Viper moves toward him. Tim, Viper's kid, wants to head for the sea and pulls his father in that direction. He stops, puts his hand on his hips like he's seen the pilots do.
</DIRECTION>
<TIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad...Of all the aminals in the ocean, which one's the baddest?

	<DIALOGUE>
	What about me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAVERICK>
<DIRECTION>
Viper turns, they stroll together.
</DIRECTION>
<VIPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can send you back to your squadron with nothing noted on your record except "CNC" --course not completed, no explanation required. Theoretically, it doesn't hurt your career, but people always wonder about things like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIPER>
<MAVERICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or....
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAVERICK>
<VIPER>
	<DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>

Maverick looks irritated. Viper stops at an icecream vendor and orders three with a gesture.
</DIRECTION>
<MAVERICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've already made up your mind.

</MAVERICK>
<VIPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's no disgrace, kid. That spin was hell. It would wreck anyone's confidence. You could be a good pilot again someday...

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think I should quit?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAVERICK>
<VIPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't say that. That's up to you. But I have responsibility for the other guys up there, not just you. They need to know you're all right...that they can depend on you.

</VIPER>

The vendor hands them icecream, they take it.

	Here, let me get this. We'll be even.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAVERICK>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches into his pocket for change, comes out with a handful. Slams it on the counter, stars picking the proper change out. Viper spots something and reaches for it...Maverick sees and tries to block it, but Viper comes up with the Navy Cross.
</DIRECTION>
<MAVERICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lucky charm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAVERICK>
<DIRECTION>
But Viper recognizes it for what it is.

<DIRECTION>
He turns, walks away. Maverick stands there for a moment, thinking, then catches up to him, stops him...struggles with the thought...as Viper breaks in...
</DIRECTION>
<VIPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You start on a wrong heading... the more you stick to it, the further you get from your target. A good pilot always questions himself, always questions his judgments, stays alert for drift and makes the corrections...You may find a little discipline helps with the fear. You don't have to be alone up there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIPER>
<DIRECTION>
A pause...quiet intensity.
</DIRECTION>
<MAVERICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How can I go on? I feel so... responsible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAVERICK>
<VIPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kid, the plain fact is...you are. I'm not gonna stand here and blow sunshine up your ass. Technically, they absolved you. You and I know what really happened. You pushed it. You are responsible and you'll always carry that. You know what, I'll carry it too. I should have taken you out of that cockpit. I guess I'm a hopeless romantic... I always try to find something worthwhile in someone's death. It's no trade-off. It's not one for one. What you learned isn't worth his death. It couldn't be. But maybe there is some value in it. I know it's the first thing I've ever seen that's really gotten to you. Now the question is, what will you do with it. If it gets you out of flight status...so you don't kill yourself or anybody else...that's good. That's one good thing. You were an accident waiting to happen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIPER>
<MAVERICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think I shouldn't fly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAVERICK>
<VIPER>

	I didn't say that. That's up to you. I think that if you do, if you choose to come back, you'll be a better pilot... a better man.

</VIPER>
<MAVERICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you take me back? Would they?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAVERICK>

Maverick draws a breath, then forces himself to pull the stick over. The F-14 rolls in hard toward the battle. Suddenly, the cluster breaks apart. The MiGs break in every direction as Maverick BLASTS through their formation. Something comes up through the clouds. A MiG BLASTS by. Another rolls in and locks onto them.

The MiGs swarm toward the TOMCATS, coming from every direction. CANNON FIRE erupts from one of the MiGs.

The F-14's execute a left oblique turn in unison. They come down in a section attack with their cannons blazing. From Maverick's cockpit, everything looks choppy: MiGs slide past at incredible speed. Cannons BLAST, as the planes scramble for position.

Out-numbered four to two, Maverick and Ice fight defensively. Maverick has the angle on a MIG, when Fungus spots a missile launch.

BULLETS fly by Maverick's F-14 from the MiG on his six. He pulls a hard left, then takes the plane straight up. We hear instructions shouted by Fungus, but it is all obscured in the SOUNDS AND FURY OF THE BATTLE. Maverick peels over the top and comes down like a comet. A series of passes at the MiGs. As they come by, one of the MiGs pulls up,

	<DIALOGUE>
	OHHHHH SHIT!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FUNGUS>
<DIRECTION>
The shock, the air pressure SLAMS them as it goes by, missing by 4-5 feet. Maverick pulls back in, sees a MiG 21 below. It takes off, bugging out. Ice goes after him. The MiG maneuvers, jerking hard left, hard right, twisting up, down.

Ice is right in his shadow. They come in hard and low over the sea. He has the MiG in the diamond.

The vapor trail comes off, the MiG 21 turns like he's been bounced off a rubber wall, comes around on the missile, beats it. The missile flies by him.

<DIRECTION>
He looks back. 30 millimeter tracers go by; they just kind of float. He breaks, hits airbrakes, the trailing MiG dives through.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly another MiG appears, rocketing straight for him. They close at 900 knots--VABOOOM!--They pass nose to nose, canopy to canopy. Both planes pitch straight up, trying for the altitude advantage.

The F-14 outclimbs the MiG sitting on its tail, full thruster, it rockets straight up, away from the planet. Maverick has the advantage. Suddenly, his F-14 runs out of energy. FUNGUS is the first to call it.

The plane backs down on itself, backs into its own smoke as it flips over, falls away...He catches it, just regains control, when...A ROAR. He looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SECOND MIG coming down. Right on him. It fills the Canopy! Instinctive - A Push to miss him, Maverick breaks fast down into him, a last ditch maneuver, and the airplane DEPARTS...the roll rates and the pitch rates combine and it tumbles over the top; the airplane just goes end-over-end. They are being slammed and rattled all over the cockpits...bone-jarring, neck-snapping whips. SHRIEKS and SCREAMS from the airframe. Terriflying?

They're in a progressive spiral, nose low. The altimeter unwinds, speed picks up. The G forces are forcing them away from the axis of spin, jamming Maverick against the instrument panel at the front of the cockpit.

He is closer to the center of spin and less strongly held. It doesn't do much good, however, he can't control the plane. The only thing he can reach is the yellow and black loop; the ejection handle. He reaches for it.

Maverick stops the tumble, pulls the nose up quickly and the F-l4 sweeps into level flight no more than a hundred feet above the deck. He comes up and looks right at Ice. Ice is down low. He comes around, a MiG-21 all over him like a cheap suit. A flick, a whip, and Maverick in perfect position, rolls right in on the MiG. Fungus looks like he just saw Jesus.

Ice breaks left, drops flares. The MiG's missile follows the flares. Maverick FIRES. The missile doesn't twitch. It flys right up the tail pipe of the MiG, the canopy flies off, the pilot comes out of it, and then the MiG blows up, We go right through the fire ball. VVVARRRUOOMMM!

He swings the nose around past Ice's. Ice's plane is covered in colored jerseys as the ground crew pulls him out. Maverick's plane swings towards the PRI-FLY BRIDGE. Pilots in flightsuits pour from the deck hatch APPLAUDING...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HE CUTS HIS ENGINES AS THE GROUND CREW SWARMS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Maverick and Fungus climb down, they see their wingmen on the deck. Ice is looking in Maverick's direction. His face is inscrutable. Maverick gets mobbed, but pushes over to Ice. They stare at each other for a moment, eye to eye even as they are buffeted by the crowd. Finally, Ice breaks...a grin.
</DIRECTION>
<ICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess I owe you one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICE>
<MAVERICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't owe me anything. We're on the same team.

</MAVERICK>
<ICE>

<ICE>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he can't resist)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can be my wingman any time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICE>
<MAVERICK>
<DIRECTION>
(laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. You can be mine!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAVERICK>
<DIRECTION>
Now Ice laughs. Nobody's ever gonna win on this one. But Ice smiles at him...It's now a running joke between them.
</DIRECTION>
<ICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever you say, Commander.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICE>
<DIRECTION>
He and Slider snap to and proudly salute. Maverick hesitates, then returns it. As Ice and Slider snap it off, it turns into the pilot's salute, they give them the bird. Maverick and Fungus laugh and return the compliment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they are mobbed by sailors, Maverick is elated to see two familiar figures: Hollywood and Wolfman turn from their battle damaged TOMCAT on the forward elevator as it sinks out of sight below decks.

	</DIALOGUE>
</STINGER>
<ICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	MiG killers! What else is there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICE>
<DIRECTION>
Maverick grins, turns away from them. He he looks out, at the dying sun glinting over the sea. He thinks how beautiful it is out here! Fungus grabs him from behind.
</DIRECTION>
<FUNGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You hear that? Anything we want. Anything...Well???

</MAVERICK>
<DIRECTION>
Stinger shakes his head no.
</DIRECTION>
<STINGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They don't seem to want to come up anymore. There's nothing on the scopes. In fact, everybody's denying the incident ever happened. So...what is it? What do you want?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STINGER>
<DIRECTION>
Maverick turns away, considering the options.

Another Tomcat rolls up to park nearby. He looks at the plane. Over the deck LOUDSPEAKER, comes the final call to the F-14:

	</DIALOGUE>
</JESTER>

Jester looks over at an admiral, who steps out of a staff car, squints up at the swooping plane, turns, barks an order to his driver, jumps in the car and SLAMS the door, the car takes off.

He stands up in the cockpit, gives a snappy salute.
</DIRECTION>
<FUNGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why Admiral....How really good it is to see you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FUNGUS>
<DIRECTION>
Maverick turns away. As he backs down the steps, a jeep screeches up, doors slam open, footsteps.
</DIRECTION>
<A_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's in charge here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</A_VOICE>
<MAVERICK>

</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</MAVERICK>
<DIRECTION>
He puts his arms around her. Self-conscious, she pulls away, a little embarrassed to show this on the flight line. He laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<MAVERICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's okay. I always look forward to a challenge.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAVERICK>
<DIRECTION>
Now she laughs back and puts her arms around him. She kisses him and now she doesn't give a damn who sees it.
