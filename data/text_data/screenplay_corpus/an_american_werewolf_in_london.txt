The pub was apparently "modernized" sometime in the mid- fifties. Its traditional Englishness combines with greasy stainless steel and glass. It is populated by mostly pale young men with longish hair. Several older men are ruddy complexioned and sport large mustaches. Four or five are watching a chess game. Two men are playing darts. The conversation is loud and there is often laughter. But there is something unsavory about these people. A look of leanness and poverty. They seem inbred and somehow sullen. We establish the types and the general level of noise in the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens revealing David and Jack. There is dead silence and all are staring in a not friendly way at the two boys who are made uncomfortable by all the strange attention. They give each other a "what?" look, then turn to the assembled populace.

</DAVID>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a full moon, `beware the moon'.

Another howl, this one long and loud. It is a very inhuman noise, terrifying, and closer this time.

<JACK>

</JACK>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.

</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
They are both visibly worried and walk briskly back from where they just came. Although after a bit of fast walking they are getting nowhere. They stop out of breath.

<DAVID>

Another bloodcurdling howl.

</JACK>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anywhere! I think we should just keep moving.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
A growl. A low guttural growl comes from out of the darkness. We stay on the boys, but we hear something out there. It starts to walk.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's moving.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's circling us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
And indeed it is. The boys strain to hear its four footfalls and they turn slowly, following it. A snarl.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
We hear the wolf-monster stop (for that's what it is - we know it's there even though we've not seen it). It sits breathing heavily.

They do and David keeps talking as they walk.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right, a lovely stroll in the moors. Tra-la-la, isn't this fun?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
The thing stalking them seems to speed up. The boys hesitate as they sense it run past them. It stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's in front of us.

</DAVID>
<JACK>

Jack and David strain to see what waits ahead of them.
</DIRECTION>

BOYS' P.O.V.

Something is waiting in the darkness. Its hulking shape is barely discernible, but its eyes glow eerily and its breath is visible.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh shit. What is that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A sheep dog or something. Turn slowly and let's walk away.

</DAVID>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Walking away, yes, sir. Here we are walking away.

</JACK>

They are in a full-out run by now. After a few minutes flight they stop, panting.

	See anything?

	No.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Well. I'm glad we...WHOAA!!

</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
David shouts as he slips suddenly in the mud, scaring Jack, and us, and himself a great deal. He lays startled on the wet ground for a moment, then he and Jack laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You really scared me, you shithead.

</JACK>
<DAVID>

Jack takes David's extended hand to help him up when THE WOLF MONSTER SPRINGS!

EXT. MOORS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lunging beast brings Jack down in one fell swoop. David falls back on his ass. Jack is screaming and struggling as he is torn to shreds. David scrambles to his feet and runs in complete panic. Jack's screams and the wolf's roars combine.

David runs and runs. Finally he falls, out of breath.

<DAVID>

He gets up and runs back to find Jack a torn and bloody mess on the ground. He stares in horror.

</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NIGHT - VARIOUS FLASH CUTS

THE WOLF SPRINGS! The camera adopts David's P.O.V. as he fights the dark savage shape on top of him. Fangs clamp down on his shoulder when shots ring out and the hulking form rolls off of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROADSIDE ON THE MOORS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David, dazed and bloody, looks and sees the men from The Slaughtered Lamb armed with shotguns and torches running towards him. Looking over at his attacker, instead of a wolf he sees a very old, naked man laying in the mud riddled with bullet holes. As the villagers crowd around, David falls back and faints.

:SC: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David is in a small, clean and very white hospital room. He lays on his back in bed, his shoulder bandaged and his arm plugged into a bottle of plasma. There are several cuts and abrasions on his arms and face, but he really doesn't look too bad. He opens his eyes slowly, blinks, and tries to sit up and look around, but is unable to because of the pain. He calls out....
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jack?!

</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
...and passes out. However his shout has fetched a nurse. She is ALEX PRICE, very English, very beautiful. She goes to the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>

	Mr. Kessler?

She looks into his eyes, lifting the lids with her thumb, and then checks his chart at the end of the bed.

David remains unconscious. Another young nurse, MISS GALLAGHER, comes in.

	He's an American, you know. Dr. Hirsch is going to fetch round one of those Embassy fellows to see him.

	Yes, Miss Gallagher, Miss Price is quite right.

<DIRECTION>
DR. HIRSCH enters. He is an older man wearing the customary lab coat. A very commanding and reassuring presence. The girls are embarrassed.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>

	Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Kessler cried out a minute ago.

<ALEX>

</DR_HIRSCH>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened to them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<DR_HIRSCH>

	The police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them. He must have been a very powerful man. Although I really don't see that it is any of your concern, Miss Price.

The shot is administered and David is held down by Dr. Hirsch and Alex until his breathing becomes more normal.

	Sgt. McManus, are you suggesting that David and Jack were, in fact, attacked by some animal and that the officialdom of East Proctor has conspired to keep it a secret? We have an autopsy report on the murderer who was shot in the act by the local police. We have two witnesses to the crime. You'll forgive me, Mr. Kessler, if I consider your testimony as coming from someone who has gone through a terrible shock.

Again the handheld camera is running furiously through the woods. Heavy breathing and the sounds of the runner crashing through the foliage.

Alex efficiently removes the covers from the dishes and sits on the edge of the bed. Taking knife and fork in hand, she neatly cuts David's food into pieces. David watches all this amused. She places a napkin under David's chin and holds up his first bite on his fork. David folds his arms and refuses to open his mouth.

Again we are running fast and faster. David again running naked, flying through the green forest. He stops suddenly, ears perked, he looks about and then we hear Jack's o.s. screams. The voice of Jack screams:

David turns in blind panic, he runs (and we run with him) desperately trying to find the source of Jack's screams.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He comes to a clearing in the woods, light streaming through the tall trees. Jack's screams halt in mid- word. David looks in disbelief at the clearing. There is a hospital bed with someone in it. It is the same as David's.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David walks toward it slowly. The figure in the bed lays still. It grows dark, very dark, and David looks up at the full moon. There is a howl identical to the one heard earlier back on the moors. David approaches the bed slowly, fearfully. We hear ocean noises on the soundtrack, the sound of crashing surf. David reaches out to pull back the covers, lightning and thunder cause him to hesitate for a second. Silence. The camera remains on David as he pulls off the covers. His face registers total disbelief and increasing horror.
</DIRECTION>

We cut to the bed to find - DAVID. He lies there, pale white with purple lips and death pallor.

<DIRECTION>
We are at David's parents' house in New York. His FATHER sits reading the paper in the living room as his younger BROTHER and SISTER watch "The Muppet Show" on television. We can see past the small dining nook where David sits doing homework and into the kitchen where his MOTHER is washing the dishes. A peaceful lower, middle class setting. All is tranquil and secure. There is a loud pounding on the front door.
</DIRECTION>
<FATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll get it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER>
<DIRECTION>
The pounding continues.
</DIRECTION>
<FATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, all right! Hold your horses.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER>
<DIRECTION>
(The following happens with shocking speed.) When he opens the door, four beings open fire with machine guns, blowing him away. The sudden burst of violence is terrifying and unrelenting. The four rush into the room and the family looks at them in fearsome surprise for these men are not human at all, but loathsome, bestial demons dressed as Storm Troopers. One kicks in the television and fires into the kitchen, blasting David's mother. David rises but is forced back into his chair by one of the things and held there.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
He watches in horror as his little brother and sister scream in terror before they are brutally murdered. The monstrous Storm Troopers then set fire to the rooms. The one holding David pulls a knife and quickly slits David's throat.

David bolts upright in bed and looks around, trying desperately to gain his bearings. He sees that Alex is asleep in the chair by his bed, Connecticut Yankee folded on her lap. He makes a deliberate effort to calm himself. He considers waking her, then decides against it. He turns on the lamp by his bed and reaches over to take the book from Alex's lap. David takes the book as gently as possible, but Alex wakes up anyway.

</ALEX>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while.

</DAVID>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's easy enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I keep having these really terrible dreams. They are getting worse and I can't seem to stop them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	David, your dreams will stop. You'll leave England and your bad memories; and then this will all fade away.

	Now, David, I said I would keep you company, but I meant right here and now.

<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're being awfully forward, aren't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forgive me, I'm trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it.

</DAVID>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>

There is an awkward pause.

:SC: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The black Orderly hustles in with David's breakfast tray, busily setting up the tray on the table over the bed. He awakens the sleeping David with his activity.
</DIRECTION>
<ORDERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah you're up. Good morning and a good day to you. We've quite a meal for you here this morning. Bacon, oatmeal, orange juice, and toast with jam. Good stuff there. Now eat it up and I'll be back for the dishes when you've finished.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ORDERLY>
<DIRECTION>
The Orderly exits. The drowsy David, who has been trying to fully wake up during the Orderly's speech, notices his exit.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at his food none too happily. He sticks a spoon into the bowl of oatmeal and tastes is gingerly.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(in mock English accent)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, sir, I want some more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
He settles down to eating, reaches over to butter his toast and drink his juice. While he eats, we hear Jack's o.s. voice.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I have a piece of toast?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
David looks over to the o.s. Jack. Jack, behaving relaxed and normal, sits in the chair last occupied by Alex. However, Jack's appearance makes his casual manner all the more surreal. He is as we left him butchered on the moors. He is covered with dried mud and open wounds. Huge glistening gashes abound on his body. His face is scratched, his throat is badly torn, and his hair is matted with blood. In several spots he has already begun to rot. He is a remarkably gruesome sight, but his physical state seems not to affect him at all.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(pleasantly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice to see you.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is too much. I can't handle this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm aware that I don't look so great, but I thought you'd be glad to see me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack gets up and takes a piece of toast from David's tray as David watches amazed. Jack returns to his seat and takes a bite out of his toast. David stares at Jack horrified.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	David! You're hurting my feelings.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(astounded)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hurting your feelings? Has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me? Listen to me, I'm talking to a hamburger!

<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry to be upsetting you, David, but I had to come.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Aren't you supposed to be buried in New York someplace?

	If you love me so much, Jack, you'll realize how disconcerting it is to share one's breakfast with the living dead!

David lifts the toilet seat and pees. He winces, hoping the steady stream doesn't awaken Alex. When he's finished peeing he goes to the sink. The medicine cabinet door over the sink is open. When David closes it he (and the audience) is terrified to see Jack reflected standing behind him. (Note: This is a big scare.) Bloodied and horrible, Jack has continued to rot and looks even worse than when we last saw him. David chokes out a strangled cry, closes his eyes tightly and then reopens them. Jack is still there in the mirror. When David turns around Jack is standing in the doorway.

At the top of the wall is a cat that begins to hiss on seeing David. The hair stands up on its arched back and it glares at David, hissing and spitting. David is disturbed by the cat's hostile behavior.

New bolts of agonizing pain wrack through David's body. He grabs at his pants, pulling them off as if they are burning him. Standing naked in the center of the room, David gasps for air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He falls to his knees and then forward on his hands. He remains on his hands and knees, trying to master his torment; but it's no use. On all fours he gives himself over to the excruciating hurt and slowly begins to change.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The metamorphosis from man into beast is not an easy one. As bone and muscle bend and reform themselves, the body suffers lacerating pain. We can actually see David's flesh move, the rearranging tissue. His mouth bleeds as fangs emerge. His whole face distorts as his jaw extends, his skull literally changing shape before our eyes. His hands gnarl and his fingers curl back as claws burst forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The camera pans up to show the full moon outside through the window. David's moans change slowly into low guttural growls. We hear the four footfalls as the WOLF begins to walk. As the camera pans back over the room, we see the front door pushed open and hear the Wolf padding off into the darkness.

David wakes up slowly. He is completely naked, his body dirty, with several scratches on his torso and legs. He yawns and stretches, makes a face, and with his finger picks something distasteful from his teeth. He also notices something under his fingernails and as he goes to clean them, he suddenly does a complete Stan Laurel discovering where he is. He puts his hands over his eyes.
