Now we see JESUS, the son of Mary, 28 years-old, sleeping under an olive tree. The mid-morning sun (OVER-EXPOSED) shines on his stubby face. He is dreaming.

	<DIALOGUE>
	It feels like the bird has grabbed me from behind. Just above the neck. Talons slip underneath the skin and work and claw their way up the back of my neck. Then the real pain begins. Each claw digs into the soft matter behind my brain, and then across the top of my head toward my eyes. Just before they reach my eyes, they dig down...

	At first I fasted for three months. Then I whipped myself before sleeping. At first it worked, then the headaches returned. I know it's God. Or the devil. Who can tell them apart? They exchange faces; God sometimes becomes all darkness, the devil all light, and they become confused in my mind.

</JESUS>
<DIRECTION>
Outside, there are NOISES of a crowd gathering nearby. Undistracted, he finishes off the piece of timber, which has become the crossbar of a cross. He places the crossbar between two brackets on the wall, then puts himself halfway between them and stretches out his arms, gauging the proper proportion.

Narrow and crowded with citizens on their way to a crucifixion. A ROMAN SOLDIER watches them with professional disinterest. His armour is non-existent, his uniform is certainly not splendid. He looks like a sloppy traffic cop. PEOPLE come from behind him and walk in front.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Over the soldier's left shoulder appears a man with blazing red hair and beard, moving with the crowd. He walks close behind the soldier for just a moment. Very professionally, he cuts his throat. The soldier falls to the ground. The man keeps walking calmly and the camera follows as, in the background, people start to notice that a soldier has been stabbed.

For God, I smother the lust, and that satisfies my pride. But my pride destroys Magdalene. I never steal or fight, or kill... not because I don't want to but because I'm afraid. I want to rebel against everything, everybody... against God!... but I'm afraid. If you look inside me you see fear, that's all. Fear is my mother, my father, my God.

	The soul is first. If you don't change what the soul needs, you'll only replace Roman domination with another domination and nothing'll ever change. First you have to change man inside. Then man can change what's around him. It's wanting wealth and power that makes the soul want to dominate others. That's the wanting we have to change, we have to free the soul first. With love.

	You can't look to the others for answers. All they can do is follow you. It's between you and me. When I went to kill you in the monastery, God took my strength away. That's what made me think, even if I didn't want to... that's what made me think you might be the one. The Messiah. Maybe you are, maybe you aren't, maybe you don't even know yourself if you are. That's why I said to myself, be patient for once in your life. See what he does, see what he says, and if he's not the Messiah there's plenty of time to kill him.

	You think love is God's only way? Go to the Dead Sea. Look in the bottom, you'll see the two whores, Sodom and Gomorrah. God was angry. He threw fire at them, turned over the dry land and the sea swallowed them up. That's God's way. 'On the day of the Lord, blood will flow from wood, the stones of the houses will come alive and kill their owners!' That day is here. He gave me the ax, now I give it to you.

	Ah yes. Well last time you took that line with me, you fooled me. I don't like to be fooled. What you did in the temple makes it very clear. You're just another of these religious revolutionaries making difficulties. You take the people into the desert, you talk about God, love, mercy and the new kingdom, but you're just the same as the Zealots. You all promise glory and bring death. There's a new Messiah every week and a new one dies every week and Rome continues.

We don't want them changed. So you know what has to happen. We have a small space for you up on Golgotha. Right next to the bones of your predecessors.

The cross-bar Jesus carries scrapes alongside the walls of the houses because the paths are extremely narrow. (high angle looking down on these open roofed dwellings and the narrow passageways.) They are jammed with people (36-48 f.p.s.). Men, women, children, (animals), in the windows and open doorways try to get a glimpse of Jesus. The atmosphere has changed. Now it's just another show. A multiple crucifixion: Laughter. Ridicule. Figs for sale. Jesus weakens. He's knees buckle, the weight of the cross-bar throws him off balance and he falls. A Roman soldier pulls him back up by a rope around his neck.

We see close shots of people, their faces. Their eyes, (36- 48 f.p.s.). Some turn away. Some cry. Some are mocking. One woman in a window, her head covered with a shawl, turns away (moving, 36-48 f.p.s.).

One or two crosses bear half-eaten decomposed corpses. On the ground, we see human skulls and bones, skeletal arms and hands mixed with the rocks.

A curious crowd has already assembled at the crucifixion site. Toward the rear, afraid to approach, Magdalene, Mary, Martha and Jesus' Mother stand in a tight group.

Years have passed. Jesus and Martha return from the market with four of their children, ages two through ten. Jesus carries the youngest, who is laughing, under his arm, like a bundle. The Guardian Angel walks with them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ahead, Mary sits in front of the house repairing a dress. Two girls play with straw dolls in the dirt beside her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two youngest children, boys, race toward Mary. One snatches a doll from one of the girls as they race off again. Mary scolds them as they go.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the distance, we hear the SOUND of someone preaching in the townsquare. The voice attracts Jesus' attention. He calls to his eldest son.

<JESUS>

	Don't forget to thank God for the food and make sure you save me some.

EXT. TOWNSQUARE - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Paul -- who we recognize as the Zealot Saul who killed Lazarus -- preaches to a handful of villagers. Standing straight, radiating confidence, he speaks with the evangelistic fervor of a born-again Christian.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I used to be a sinner. The worst sinner. I did everything. Whored, drank, murdered. I killed anyone who violated the Law of Moses. Then, I was struck by a burning light and a voice called to me, 'Saul, why are you persecuting me? Why are you against me?' 'Who are you?' I said. 'Jesus,' the voice said, and he gave me my sight. I opened my eyes and I was baptized and became Paul. I bring the good news to every country.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
Jesus comes closer, the Angel by his side.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I bring this news. About Jesus of Nazareth. He wasn't the son of Mary, he was the son of God. His mother was a virgin. The angel Gabriel came to earth and put God's seed in her womb. That's how he was born. He took on our sins, he was tortured, crucified -- but three days later he rose again and was taken up to heaven. Death was conquered, praise God! Death was conquered, sins were forgiven and the Kingdom of Heaven's now open to everyone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
Jesus can restrain himself no longer. He calls out:
</DIRECTION>
<JESUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you ever see this resurrected Jesus of Nazareth? I mean, with your own eyes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESUS>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. But I saw a blinding flash of light and I heard his voice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<JESUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a liar!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESUS>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His disciples saw him. They were hiding in an attic with the doors locked when suddenly he appeared. Only one, Thomas, wasn't convinced but he put his fingers in his wounds and gave Jesus some fish, which he ate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<JESUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Liar!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to people around him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's a liar!

</JESUS>
<DIRECTION>
Disgusted, Jesus turns and walks away. His angel follows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the background, Paul comes after him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jesus feels Paul's footsteps drawing closer. He's about to explode. Suddenly, he turns on his heel, grabs Paul by the shoulders and shakes him violently.
</DIRECTION>
<JESUS>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a liar! I'm Jesus of Nazareth. I was never crucified. I never came back from the dead. I'm a man like everyone else. Why are you spreading these lies?

</JESUS>
<ANGEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quiet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANGEL>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you talking about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<JESUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm the son of Mary and Joseph, who preached in Galilee. James and John, the sons of Zebedee, were my disciples. We marched on Jerusalem, they brought me before Pilate, but God saved me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESUS>
<DIRECTION>
Jesus' Angel doesn't like this conversation; he tugs violently at his sleeve. Jesus shoves him aside. Paul takes Jesus around a corner where they won't be seen.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No he didn't!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<JESUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now I live like a man. I have a family. I eat, work, have children. Do you understand what I'm saying? Don't go around the world spreading these lies about me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(shouts)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because, I'll tell everyone the truth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESUS>
<DIRECTION>
Now it's Paul's turn to explode.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look around you! Look at these people. Do you see the suffering and unhappiness in this world? Their only hope is the Resurrected Jesus. I don't care whether you're Jesus or not. The Resurrected Jesus will save the world -- that's what matters.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<JESUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The world can't be saved by lies.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESUS>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I created the truth. I make it out of longing and faith. I don't struggle to find truth -- I build it. If it's necessary to crucify you to save the world, then I'll crucify you. And I'll resurrect you too, whether you like it or not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<JESUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I won't let you. I'll tell everyone the truth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESUS>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shout all you want. Who'll believe you? You started all this, now it can't be stopped. The faithful will grab you and call you a blasphemer and throw you in a fire.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<JESUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, that wouldn't happen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESUS>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you know? You don't know how much people need God. You don't know what a joy it is to hold the cross, to put hope in the hearts of men, to suffer, to be killed -- all for the sake of Christ. Jesus Christ. Jesus of Nazareth, Son of God. Messiah.

</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
Jesus is listening intently now.

	Not you. Not for your sake.

Jesus, now in his 50's, sits in the vine arbor beside the house. His Guardian Angel, unchanged by time, sits beside him. Jesus turns to him:

</ANGEL>
<DIRECTION>
The Angel looks at Jesus who has suddenly aged to his 80's. Jesus does not react to this transformation.
</DIRECTION>

Now SOUNDS of yelling and screaming come from the street. A woman's WAIL pierces the air. Jesus and the Angel turn to look.

Mary and Martha, aged similarly, rush from the house. Jesus and the Angel stand.

<DIRECTION>
Mary and Martha stand close around him. Jesus is in no pain. He seems to be at peace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly looming in the entranceway, silhouetted against the red sky, is the figure of an old man. He starts down the few stone steps into the room where Jesus lies. He is followed by two other men. The Guardian Angel recognizes them instantly and starts toward them.

Jesus points to the mutilated man standing next to Peter. The man's face is a mask of injury: he is missing his nose, and one eye, and one ear.

	Traitor. Your place was on the cross. That's where God put you. But when death got too close you ran away, you got scared and ran away and hid yourself in the life of some... man. We did what we were supposed to do. You didn't. You're a coward.

	Understand? Rabbi, you broke my heart. Sometimes I curse the day I ever met you. We held the world in our hands. Remember what you said to me? You took me in your arms, do you remember? And you begged me. "Betray me, betray me. I have to be crucified. I have to be resurrected to save the world."

	Abba, father, will you still listen to me? Are you still there? Will you listen to a selfish, unfaithful son? I fought you when you called. I resisted. I thought I knew more.
