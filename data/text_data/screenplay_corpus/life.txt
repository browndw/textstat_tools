EXT. PRISON CEMETERY -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A handful of people are gathered in an open field under a fierce Mississippi sun. A couple of young inmates, JAKE and LEON, lean on their shovels. They are waiting to bury two identical CASKETS with inmate numbers stenciled on the pinewood lids.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A GUARD rests the butt of his rifle on the ground and takes a long, healthy pull from his canteen. He offers it to the PRISON CHAPLAIN, who is much obliged. SUPERINTENDENT BILL BURKE, a 40-year-old black man, glances at his watch and loosens his tie. Sure is hot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARY HUMPHRIES, an elderly white woman in a nurse's uniform, stands behind WILLIE LONG, an ancient inmate sleeping peacefully in a wheelchair. She readjusts an umbrella to shield the old black man from the blistering sun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Burke dabs his forehead with a handkerchief. He gives the nod to the chaplain, who steps forward and cracks his bible. The men remove their hats.
</DIRECTION>
<CHAPLAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In accordance with the regulations of the State of Mississippi, we gather here today to lay to rest the remains of inmates R. Gibson, number 4316, and C. Banks, number 4317. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. May God have mercy on their souls.

The young inmates plunge their shovels into the dirt. One by one, the mourners head back toward a prison van parked on a nearby dirt road.

She leaves Willie alone with Jake and Leon. He rolls his chair up to the edge of the graves and gazes at the pinewood caskets.

	<DIALOGUE>
	1932? That's like, that's like...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEON>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Sixty-five years ago. They always said the farm couldn't hold 'em forever. Looks like you're finally free, boys.

Willie pulls a bottle of moonshine from his jacket and takes a swig in their honor.

Willie passes the bottle to Leon, who takes a swig and winces from the unexpected kick.
</DIRECTION>
<LEON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hell of a way to get out. Heard they burned up in that fire yesterday.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEON>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>

EXT. SPANKY'S BACK ALLEY (1932) -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RAY GIBSON holds up a similar bottle of liquor to a light over a door. Music comes from within. He takes a swig and stashes the bottle in his belt. He adjusts his tie, polishes his shoes on the back of his pants and raps on the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SPANKY'S -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The speakeasy is jumping, jammed with people. Up on stage a hot JAZZ BAND is playing backup for a seductive CHANTEUSE. Well-heeled PATRONS enter through doors near the stage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the back, at the end of a long hallway, a BOUNCER cracks open the door and Ray squeezes inside.
</DIRECTION>
<BOUNCER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, no, Ray. Not tonight. Spanky's not happy with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOUNCER>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is Spanky here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<BOUNCER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, but...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOUNCER>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then what's the problem?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<BOUNCER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do yourself a favor and find another place where they let you in the front door.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOUNCER>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But this is where the action is and I have to be where the action is. Look, when your old lady wanted those alligator shoes, didn't I come through for you? Ain't she stepping in style now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<BOUNCER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOUNCER>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, alright then. What do you think about this new tie?

</RAY>
<BOUNCER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sharp.

Ray heads inside.
</DIRECTION>
<BOUNCER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyone asks, it wasn't me who let you in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOUNCER>
<DIRECTION>
Ray slides through the crowd, pausing at the bar to nibble on the neck of a COCKTAIL WAITRESS.
</DIRECTION>
<COCKTAIL_WAITRESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't even try it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COCKTAIL_WAITRESS>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When do you get off?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<COCKTAIL_WAITRESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I get off at two, but you ain't never getting off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COCKTAIL_WAITRESS>
<DIRECTION>
She carries a tray of drinks into the crowd. Ray shakes his head in wonderment at her departing form. The BARKEEP steps up as Ray pulls out his bottle.
</DIRECTION>
<BARKEEP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't drink that in here, Ray.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARKEEP>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I sure can't drink that watered-down swill you're serving. Give me a glass of ice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<BARKEEP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't give you a glass of ice. I can't give you anything until you pay your damn tab.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARKEEP>
<DIRECTION>
Disregarding the warning, Ray tilts the bottle back. Shaking his head, the barkeep moves on to a paying customer. Ray's eyes follow a bottle of French Champagne as it is delivered to a nearby table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Here sits the straight-laced CLAUDE BANKS with his girlfriend, DAISY. She's enjoying the show. He's polishing the silverware. The WAITER pours two glasses of champagne and leaves the bottle on ice. Claude regards his glass skeptically.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For the kind of money they charge here, you'd think they could hire somebody to actually wash the dishes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DAISY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Claude. Here's to your new job down at the bank. I always knew you'd make something of yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAISY>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Know what I'm going to buy with my first pay check?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
Daisy thinks she does. She leans in, eyes twinkling.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Season tickets to the Yankees. Right there on the first base line.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off her disappointment)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's wrong, baby?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DAISY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was hoping you were gonna say an engagement ring, Claude.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAISY>
<DIRECTION>
French Champagne shoots out of Claude's nose.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Engagement ring!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DAISY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what respectable folks do. Get a job, get married, start having babies. That's what you want, isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAISY>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure it is. I just don't see any reason to rush into things. Damn, look at this shirt. I'll be right back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
Claude leans in to kiss Daisy on the lips. She offers her cheek. He departs.

<DIRECTION>
Ray watches Claude make a beeline for the men's room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MEN'S ROOM -- NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Claude steps into the bathroom and approaches the sink. A big hand falls on his shoulder and yanks him backwards into a stall...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STALL -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Claude is shoved down on the toilet by two BAG MEN in suits. Suddenly, it's crowded in here.
</DIRECTION>
<BAG_MAN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Congratulations, Claude. We understand you finally got yourself a job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAG_MAN_1>
<BAG_MAN_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guess that means you can pay Mr. Riley the fifty bucks you owe him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAG_MAN_2>
<DIRECTION>
They rifle through Claude's jacket and quickly find his wallet.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now wait a second, guys. I've got a bill to pay out there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<BAG_MAN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twenty-two dollars. Not bad for a start.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAG_MAN_1>
<DIRECTION>
They toss back his empty wallet.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, fellas, that's two weeks pay. I'm here with my girl. You gotta leave me something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<BAG_MAN_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about your legs?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAG_MAN_2>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>

On his way into the Men's Room, Ray squeezes past the bag men on their way out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MEN'S ROOM -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Glancing around, Ray spots Claude's feet under the stall door. He steps up to the sink, washes his hands and takes a towel from the ATTENDANT. Scanning the assortment of grooming products, he selects a bottle of cologne and takes a sniff.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
<DIRECTION>
(displeased)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have any of that French stuff?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
As the attendent bends down to retrieve a bottle of the good stuff, Ray palms a coin from the tip basket.
</DIRECTION>
<ATTENDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here you go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ATTENDENT>
<DIRECTION>
Ray offers the quarter, a gesture of uncommon generosity.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep the change.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<ATTENDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, thank you, sir!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ATTENDENT>
<DIRECTION>
Ray pats the cologne on his face. A toilet flushes and Claude steps over to the sink. Ray catches his eye in the mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't I know you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure I do. What's your name again?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Claude Banks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Claude Banks. How could I forget that? You've got to remember me. Ray Gibson. We went to high school together.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You went to Monroe?

<RAY>
<DIRECTION>
(beaming)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right! Good old Monroe...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
Ray throws his arms around Claude, deftly snatching his wallet. Claude extracts himself from Ray's embrace.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I went to Jefferson, so you must have a different Claude Banks in mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
Claude straightens his jacket and heads for the door. Ray stashes the stolen wallet in his jacket.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, man. My mistake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SPANKY'S -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the stage, the chanteuse has downshifted into a sultry number about back-door lovers and broken dreams.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray steps out of the men's room and is instantly collared by BULLETHEAD, a man who makes his living being large and threatening.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watch the threads, Bullethead. If this is about my tab, I've got it covered.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
Pressed up against the wall, Ray reaches into his jacket and produces Claude's wallet. Bullethead snatches it, inspects it and is not impressed.
</DIRECTION>
<BULLETHEAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This ain't about your tab, Ray. You've got bigger problems than that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BULLETHEAD>
<DIRECTION>
He stuffs the wallet back into Ray's jacket and hustles Ray out the back door past the bouncer who let him in.
</DIRECTION>
<BOUNCER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that Ray Gibson? Who the hell let him in here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOUNCER>

Claude returns to the table where Daisy is sipping champagne. He takes the glass out of her hand.

	</DIALOGUE>
</WAITER>
<DIRECTION>
The waiter presents Claude with the bill.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>

INT. VAN -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Claude is shoved into the back of the van and the doors are slammed behind him. He bangs and shouts, but it's no use.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Save your energy, Claude. You're gonna need it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
Ray is stretched out against the back wall. Claude is knocked to the floor as the van lurches into motion.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here, this belongs to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(tossing Claude his wallet)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was empty when I found it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good old Monroe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
Ray swigs from his bottle and offers it to Claude, who isn't interested.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What I want to know is what happened to your cush between the time that you got up from the table and when I caught up with you in the Johnny?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't see where that's any of your business.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did those two muscle heads shake you down? Swear I've seen them down at the track with Sure-shot Riley. That's it, ain't it? A gambling debt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
Busted, Claude snatches the bottle and carefully wipes off the neck before tilting it high. Ray gets a good chuckle out of this straight cat in the bow tie.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where they taking us, anyway?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Probably to Spanky's headquarters down at the pier.

(Claude nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Over ten bucks?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he nods again)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're probably looking at a thumb.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A thumb? What do you mean, like cut it off? For ten bucks?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Ray nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That include the tip?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
Claude shoves his hands under his armpits at the sound of approaching FOOTSTEPS echoing across the vast space. Claude and Ray peer into the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<SPANKY>
<DIRECTION>
(from the darkness)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You picked the wrong night to fuck with me, Ray. I just lost three men and a truck full of Canadian whiskey. You know what that kind of thing does to my business? It makes me want to lash out and hurt somebody.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPANKY>
<DIRECTION>
SPANKY JOHNSON emerges into the light. He uses a small silver spoon to take an ample snort of cocaine into each nostril. He glances at Claude.
</DIRECTION>
<SPANKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's he? Friend of yours, Ray?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPANKY>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never saw this man before tonight. He's a lowlife degenerate who lurks in bathrooms. I'm a professional man, an upstanding citizen. I go to church on Sunday.

<SPANKY>

	Then what are you doing here?

</BULLETHEAD>
<CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
(rattled)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Mr. Johnson, you seem like a reasonable man. I got a good job starts Monday. I'll pay you back with my first pay check. With interest. I don't want to tell you how to conduct your business, but if you cut off my finger you won't get jack. Working an adding machine, I gotta be whole.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(his fingers dancing over imaginary keys)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need my thumbs and all my fingers for praying and doing good...

Spanky holds up a hand, silencing Claude.

<SPANKY>

	The choirboy wants to keep his fingers. Who am I to argue? Drop him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPANKY>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drop him? What does drop him mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
Claude protests loudly as Bullethead and the henchman bind his hands and feet. Spanky turns to Ray.
</DIRECTION>
<SPANKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You gotta lotta balls showing your face around my club. If a man's gonna run numbers on my side of Broadway, you think he'd have the common sense to keep a low profile. But not Ray Gibson.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPANKY>
<DIRECTION>
The goons hoist Claude up on another pulley and dangle him head first over a hole in the floor. Several feet down, the Harlem River laps against the wooden pylons.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, not down there! That water's filthy! Help me out here, man!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
Shrugging, Ray pinches his nose and puffs out his cheeks. The goons release the rope and Claude plunges into the water. Spanky turns back to Ray.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't have to drown that fella, Spanky. You already scared him half to death. He didn't know who he was fucking with.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<SPANKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you do. What does that say about you, Ray? What does that say about me? I've given you a lot of leeway over the years on account of your father. But he didn't last long enough to teach you the meaning of the word respect so I guess I'm gonna have to school you myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPANKY>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Spank, I'm just trying to get by here. You remember how it was when you were starting out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
The henchman yanks on the rope. Claude emerges from the hole, gasping for breath.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was supposed to wear this suit on Monday!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
The henchman releases the rope, sending Claude back into the water. Ray reaches into his jacket. Bullethead pulls a gun and presses it into Ray's temple. Ray gives him a look and cautiously pulls out his bottle.
</DIRECTION>
<SPANKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that, some of your bathtub brew?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPANKY>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Puerto Rican rum. See for yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
Ray tosses him the bottle. Spanky uncorks, sniffs, samples the goods. He's impressed.
</DIRECTION>
<SPANKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where'd you get this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPANKY>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Comes up the Mississippi. I can get more. A lot more. I was thinking about going into business for myself, but under the circumstances, I'd be willing to take on a partner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
Once again, the henchman yanks on the rope and Claude comes up sucking air desperately. He releases the rope, submerging Claude for a third time.
</DIRECTION>
<SPANKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm interested. Keep talking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPANKY>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All I need is the front money and a truck. I could be back in two, three days tops if I had somebody to share the driving.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
Spanky considers the terms. Can he afford to trust Ray? Can he afford not to?
</DIRECTION>
<SPANKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you fuck me on this one, I'll spare no expense.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPANKY>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Understood.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<SPANKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright, Ray, you've got a deal. Pick your man and get going.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPANKY>
<DIRECTION>
Ray glances around. The pulley rope is still twitching in the water.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll take the little choirboy, if you don't mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<SPANKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I was you, I'd want somebody who can handle himself in a tight spot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPANKY>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just want somebody who won't put a bullet in my back once the truck is full.

Spanky sees Ray's point. He nods to the henchman, who hoists Claude's limp body out of the water and onto the cement. Spanky plants a foot on Claude's chest and applies pressure. A geyser of Harlem River water shoots from Claude's mouth as he sputters back to life.

<DIRECTION>
Tight-lipped, Claude shifts in his seat.

<RAY>

	Sometimes I wish I could find me a sheba to settle down with. Suppose I'm just a tomcat by nature.

<DIRECTION>
(trying to fill the silence)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This little rum run is gonna seriously improve my relationship with Spanky. He's a good man to have on your side. He's got the capital and the connections. That's what you got to have in that business. Spanky's place is pretty plush, but one of these days I'm gonna open up my own establishment. Ray's Boom-Boom Room. You like that? Ray's Boom-Boom Room. That's in the groove, don't you think?

If Claude does like it, he's not letting on.

	Come on, daddy-o. You haven't said a word since we started. Least you could do is make some friendly conversation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, man, I don't want friendly conversation. I don't want to be your friend. I've seen your friends and I don't like them. I just want to do this thing and get back to New York in time to start my job.

	Start your job? What kind of job?
	</DIALOGUE>

	That's some long green.

	Well, maybe I should dig around in other people's clothes for money. It's obviously been highly successful for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, you'd be surprised what you find in other people's pockets. Just gotta avoid them deadbeat bank tellers. Get you every time.

</RAY>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't start out to be a bank teller. I was gonna be a ballplayer. Even had an offer to play short for the Newark Eagles.

	You're talking about giving up baseball to be a bank teller.

<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>

Ray stuffs his daddy's watch back in his pocket.

Claude tugs Ray towards the door but Ray won't be dissuaded. He boldly addresses a YOUNG MAN in an apron behind the counter.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good evening, Billy. We'd like some coffee and a couple of slices of that homemade pie you've got advertised.

Billy's MAMA sets a piping hot pie on the back counter and steps up next to her son. She casts a disparaging glance at Claude's suit.

Claude considers the sign she's pointing to.

	Look, ma'am, we've been driving all day. We'd just like to purchase one of those pies and we'll be on our way.

	Excuse me, ma'am, I bet a brick will turn that one right there into a colored pie.

The truck rolls up to the waters edge. Ray kills the engine and flashes the lights twice. In the passenger seat, Claude is fast asleep. After a few moments, a FAT MAN appears, shining a flashlight into the cab.

EXT. DOCKS -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Under cover of darkness, a couple of MEN finish loading crates into the bed of the truck. Ray and Claude keep their eyes peeled for the law. Down by the river, they can see lights and hear music from a district of rowdy juke joints. SLIM steps up, wiping his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<SLIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's it, fellas. Thirty six cases of Puerto Rico's finest. At five bucks a case, that's $180.

Ray pulls out a wad and slaps it in Slim's sweaty palm. The fat man starts counting it out.

	Oh, I don't know, maybe because our lives depend on it, I just sort of thought you knew what you were doing!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't get all agitated on me. I bought a bottle of rum from a couple of dudes, I heard 'em talking...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me get this straight. We drove all the way down to Klan country 'cause you heard a couple of guys talking?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you complaining about? It worked out. Everything's cool. Now, come on, let's head down there and see what's shaking. We deserve a little reward.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Reward?

</CLAUDE>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are people down there having fun. I want to be one of them. I want you to be one of them. On Monday you can be a bank teller if you want, but tonight you're a bootlegger with a truck full of Puerto Rican rum and a fistful of cash.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
A look of excitement crosses Claude's face, but he quickly shakes it off.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's gas money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
Exasperated, Ray stuffs a few bills into Claude's pocket.

<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's your gas money. You stay here and watch the truck. And don't worry, I've got the keys.

INT. JUKE JOINT -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A ramshackle den of iniquity on the banks of the Mississippi. The band is laying down some serious Delta blues, creating an inviting atmosphere for sin and moral corruption.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On a far side of the room, Ray is playing poker with some LOCALS. He seems to be having a bad night. WINSTON HANCOCK, a formidable black man, sweeps in another big pot and puffs happily on his cigar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OVER AT THE BAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Perched on a stool, Claude shoots a dark look at Ray and motions for the door. Ray waves him off and returns to his game. Claude becomes aware of a soft, young female hand on his shoulder.

Against his better judgement, Claude's gaze follows the long, slender arm up past a bare shoulder and settles on SYLVIA'S angelic face. He is struck dumb.

BACK AT THE POKER TABLE

Winston considers his cards, hardly looking up as a WAITRESS lays down a cocktail napkin and sets a drink down on top of it. He glances at Ray, who casually considers his cards.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll take two.
	</DIALOGUE>

The dealer tosses Ray a couple of cards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT -- Ray fans his cards to reveal a full house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After considering the other players at the table, Ray pushes what's left of his money into the center of the table. The three other PLAYERS fold with disgust. Winston squints long and hard at Ray, then pushes everything he has into the center of the table.
</DIRECTION>
<WINSTON>

</WINSTON>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, hang on, slick. I ain't through with you yet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
Ray checks his cards again. He looks at the pot, it's a lot of money. With this hand, there's no way he can lose. He places his daddy's pocket watch on top of the pile. Winston checks the time piece.
</DIRECTION>
<WINSTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That'll cover it.

Ray sits back, stunned. Winston rakes in his winnings. The game is over for the night. The three other players head to the bar.
</DIRECTION>
<WINSTON>

	Don't take it too hard, New York. Have a round on me.

Winston tosses a silver dollar to Ray, who snatches it out of the air. Winston drops his hat on his head and moves through the crowd and out the door.
</DIRECTION>
<WAITRESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I get you something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAITRESS>
<DIRECTION>
Ray shakes his head. Carefully, she begins to clear the table. Suddenly, he grabs her wrist. Winston's glass tips over. Ray flips over the cocktail napkin to reveal an extra pile of cards.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looks like he had a whole lot of nothing in his hand until you came along.

EXT. BACK ALLEY -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Winston produces Ray's pocket watch and pops it open. A smile crosses his face as the mechanical tune plays.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sheriff's sedan rounds a corner, illuminating Winston in its headlights. The car pulls up and SHERIFF WARREN PIKE steps out. Distinguished by a casual cruelness, he's a young white man who loves his uniform.
</DIRECTION>
<PIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If it isn't Winston Hancock.
	</DIALOGUE>

Winston tries to move past Pike, but the sheriff blocks his path with a night stick. As Winston backs off, another squad car pulls up behind him. TWO DEPUTIES step from the car, guns drawn.
</DIRECTION>
<PIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought we agreed that you were gonna leave town.

</PIKE>
<WINSTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I tried to leave, Sheriff Pike. But your wife begged me to stay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINSTON>
<DIRECTION>
Pike slams Winston with his club, sending the black man to his knees. As Winston struggles back to his feet, a stiletto flashes and he lunges for the sheriff, slashing his cheek. The deputies grab Winston from behind, holding him by both arms. The long knife clatters to ground. Pike touches his face, examining the blood on his fingers.
</DIRECTION>
<PIKE>

Ray opens the door and peeks in. Sylvia's on top and in charge. Claude is concentrating real hard. Ray smiles to himself and closes the door.

INT. JUKE JOINT -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Claude hitches up his suspenders as he comes down the stairs. He finds Ray having a drink at the now-empty bar.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Ray. I've been looking for you.

</CLAUDE>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That jelly you were talking to right here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's in a tight spot. Her mama needs this operation, and they ain't got the money for it. Their church took up a collection but they were still short...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you made a generous contribution.

</RAY>

EXT. BACK ALLEY -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray and Claude head down the alley.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sure the truck's this way?

<DIRECTION>
(looking over his shoulder)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I swear it was back that way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the bloodied figure of Winston Hancock lurches from the shadows and grabs Claude by the lapels. Claude is too scared to scream, staggering backward. But the man's grip loosens and he slips to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
(croaking)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ray... Yo, Ray...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
Ray turns back to find Claude trembling with fear and covered in blood. He just points down. Ray eyes widen. He kneels down and turns Winston's body over.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think he's hurt pretty bad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's dead.

</RAY>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, man, I've never seen a dead body before!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
Much to Claude's horror, Ray starts rifling through Winston's pockets.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you think you're doing?! The man's been dead for two seconds! Don't you have any respect?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It ain't here.

</RAY>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>

</CLAUDE>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My daddy's watch. This is the dude I was telling you about --
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>

Suddenly, the glare of two bright headlights from a pickup truck freeze Ray and Claude in a guilty tableau. FIVE WHITE MEN appear at the end of the alley.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN_WITH_LANTERN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's going on here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN_WITH_LANTERN>
<DIRECTION>
Ray gingerly releases Winston's lifeless body.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN_WITH_LANTERN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's wrong with that one?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN_WITH_LANTERN>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Him? He's just drunk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, nobody puts 'em away like old what's-his-name.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Winston. His name's Winston.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Ray, better get Winston back to the truck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
Claude and Ray hoist Winston's body to its feet. The man raises his lantern, takes a closer look at Winston's face.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN_WITH_LANTERN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This fella looks dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN_WITH_LANTERN>
<DIRECTION>
Ray and Claude check for themselves.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you look at that, Ray. Winston up and died on us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hell with him then. If he can't share the driving, he can't ride in the truck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<MAN_WITH_LANTERN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He can ride with us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN_WITH_LANTERN>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the men all have guns. And they're pointed at Ray and Claude.

<MAN_WITH_LANTERN>

INT. NATCHEZ JAIL -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a holding cell, Ray tests the window bars. Solid. Meanwhile, Claude sits on a cot brooding darkly. Through the bars, we see the rednecks laughing and passing around a bottle of bootleg rum with the DEPUTY on duty.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Man, this is gonna delay everything. Spanky's gonna be pissed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Spanky's gonna be pissed? Poor Spanky. Fuck Spanky! What the hell kind of a name is Spanky, anyway? You're responsible for this situation. I blame you for everything. If it wasn't for you, I'd be home having a hot meal right now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If it wasn't for me, you'd be washing up on the beach at Coney Island right now.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"I need all my thumbs and fingers for praying and doing good."
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
The jailhouse door opens and Sheriff Pike walks in. He pauses to give the prisoners the once-over. There's a fresh bandage over the cut on his cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<PIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do we have here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIKE>
<DEPUTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Billy Bob and the boys found them down down under the hill with Winston Hancock. He was dead. Looks like murder.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEPUTY>
<PIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't say.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIKE>
<DEPUTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looks like they was running rum. Got thirty six cases of evidence out back. You want I should call in the federal prosecutor?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEPUTY>
<PIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's not drag the feds into this. I can think of better uses for that rum than letting it collect dust in some government warehouse up in Nashville.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIKE>
<DIRECTION>
Pike winks at his deputy, then turns to regard the prisoners.
</DIRECTION>
<PIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Besides, why bother with bootlegging when we got us a clear cut case of murder?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIKE>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me, sheriff. As we explained to your associate here, there's been a mistake. We didn't kill anybody. Now, as for the bootlegging, we happen to work for a very important man in New York.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right. Does the name Spanky Johnson mean anything to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<PIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Afraid not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIKE>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Johnson is very well connected. If you were to let us go, I guarantee he would show you his appreciation, if you know what I mean.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<PIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you offering me a bribe?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIKE>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm just trying to pay the toll on the road to justice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<PIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You may be able to buy your way out of trouble up in New York City, but down here we take murder seriously.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIKE>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, man, how many times we gotta tell you people, we didn't kill that guy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<PIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, if that's the case, then you don't have anything to worry about, do you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIKE>
<DIRECTION>
Pike turns his back on the prisoners and checks the time on a gold pocket watch -- Ray's pocket watch. But from his cell, Ray can't hear the mechanical tune.
</DIRECTION>
<PIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Time to get home to the missus. See y'all in the morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIKE>
<DIRECTION>
In the cell, Claude turns to Ray.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The man's gotta point. We're innocent, after all. I just gotta get a good night's sleep on this filthy mattress. Keep our heads on straight, stay cool, what's the worst thing that could happen to us?

</JUDGE>
<DIRECTION>
The gavel comes down with a thundering crash. Stunned, Ray and Claude resist the BAILIFFS' efforts to remove them from the courtroom.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Life?! How long is life? We were just walking back to the truck. We didn't do nothing! Fuck life!

They continue to protest loudly as they are dragged bodily through the door.

EXT. COUNTRYSIDE -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blues music kicks in as a prison transport bus rolls down a dirt road cutting through the bleak Mississippi Delta.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUS (MOVING) -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LONG-CHAIN CHARLIE, a white prison sergeant, sits behind the wheel. A shot gun hangs within easy reach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA MOVES BACK past grim-faced PRISONERS with their hands and feet shackled. We arrive at Ray and Claude sitting in grim silence as the bus lurches along.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PRISON -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bus veers off the country road and passes under a sign: MISSISSIPPI STATE PENITENTIARY. Sgt. Dillard's voice PLAYS OVER.
</DIRECTION>
<DILLARD>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Welcome to the farm. Here you will be provided with ample opportunity to repay your debt to society through the rigors of hard labor...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DILLARD>
<DIRECTION>
Ray and Claude stare out the window, getting their first look at the harsh reality that awaits them. Cotton fields stretch to the horizon in every direction. HOE-GANGS till the earth under the watchful gaze of TRUSTY SHOOTERS...
</DIRECTION>
<DILLARD>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In between harvest and planting season we got fields need clearing, roads need building and ditches need digging. You will eat only what you can grow. Your crop don't come in, you'll go hungry. If you die, don't worry 'bout us none. We'll find somebody to replace you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DILLARD>
<DIRECTION>
Along the road, CONVICTS cast hard looks at the new men as the cart passes. A WHITE SERGEANT on horseback shifts his rifle and casually spits tobacco juice in the dirt...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CAMP 8 -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A low-slung, single-story bunkhouse surrounded by a dirt yard. Two shooter shacks sit at diagonal corners of the yard. In each shack, two trusties with rifles keep vigilant watch over the camp. SGT. FRED DILLARD paces down the line of new men as HOPPIN' BOB, an uncommonly ugly trusty, unlocks their leg irons.
</DIRECTION>
<DILLARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This here is Camp 8. Camp 8 is for incorrigibles, so whatever you've done to get here, believe me, we're not impressed. You new men are probably noticing that we have no fences here at Camp 8. We don't need no fences, we have the gun line. It runs from shack to shack clear around the yard. You are now inside the gun line. If you step outside the gun line without my permission, you will be shot. If you trip and fall over the gun line, you will be shot. If you spit, if you pee, if you stick your ass out and take a dump over the gun line, you will be shot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DILLARD>
<DIRECTION>
Dillard plucks a hat off one of the new prisoners and tosses it over the gun line. SHOTS ring out from the nearest shack. The hat is torn to shreds.
</DIRECTION>
<DILLARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One of my trusties puts a bullet in you when you're trying to run, I'm liable to give him a pardon for saving me the trouble of tracking you down, so you can bet their aim is true.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DILLARD>
<DIRECTION>
Dillard puts a cigarette in his mouth. Hoppin' Bob is right there with the flame.
</DIRECTION>
<DILLARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My name is Sgt. Dillard. In the unlikely event that you need to address me, you call me boss. You already met this handsome fella right here. Hoppin' Bob's my ace boon coon. You run afoul of Hoppin' Bob, you run afoul of me.

Nodding to Bob, Dillard saunters off.

INT. BUNKHOUSE -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Double bunks line the walls, with a footlocker for each inmate. As usual, there's a poker game going on.
</DIRECTION>
<HOPPIN_BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, ladies, got some fresh meat for ya!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOPPIN_BOB>
<DIRECTION>
All activity comes to a halt as the new men shuffle into the cage wearing their prison-issue "ring-arounds." Hoppin' Bob slams the metal doors shut behind them.
</DIRECTION>
<HOPPIN_BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We ain't got no wallflowers at Camp 8. Everybody gotta dance eventually. But don't worry, they won't try nothing tonight. That would take all of the fun outta the courtship.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOPPIN_BOB>
<DIRECTION>
The INCORRIGIBLES hungrily eye the new men in total silence. Claude sticks close to Ray as they shuffle toward their assigned bunks. The CAMERA SETTLES on a much younger WILLIE LONG.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COUNTRY ROAD -- MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The inmates jump down from the mule cart and grab hoes and shovels. Because he can't count, Hoppin' Bob keeps track of the men using a system all his own -- a PEBBLE in his pocket for each man. Dillard stands by with his shotgun.
</DIRECTION>
<DILLARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Got three miles of ditch to clear today. Let's keep it moving!

EXT. DITCH -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The men of Camp 8 labor under the brutal mid-day sun. JANGLE LEG, a handsome, muscular man, sings a verse to set the work tempo. Up and down the line, a mighty chorus responds. The CAMERA FINDS Ray and Claude swinging pick axes, sweating profusely.
</DIRECTION>

Claude looks up to see Dillard cracking pistachio nuts as Hoppin' Bob puts another round in the chamber of his rifle.

Annoyed, Dillard jabs the butt of his rifle into Ray's solar plexus. Ray sinks to his knees in the dirt.

The prisoners express their condolences. "Sorry, man." "That's some bad news." "I know you loved Bo like a brother..."
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>

	And your other cousin, Sally, on your daddy's side, she died.

Ray shrugs and presses on. Dumbfounded, Claude considers the map again, then tears it to shreds. The braying of hounds echoes through the trees.

The posse is gaining ground. Dillard takes two men off to the left, sending the rest of the men straight ahead.

EXT. THE WOODS -- NIGHT

Claude clears the fence first and scrambles for the old Ford. Ray's shirt snags on a piece of wire as he drops down from the fence. Stuck, he dangles helplessly a few feet off the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FORD -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Claude yanks open the door and jumps behind the wheel. TWO WHITE TEENAGERS bolt up in the backseat where they were necking. After a beat -- group scream. The half-dressed teenagers dive from the car and scramble off down the road. Claude twists the key in the ignition and the engine roars to life.

EXT. FENCE -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

Claude runs up and grabs Ray's legs, pulling for all he's worth. The shirt rips free, sending Ray and Claude tumbling to the ground. They leap to their feet and turn toward the car -- running smack into the barrel of Dillard's shotgun.

An OLD BLACK PRISONER delivers a frosty mint julep to SUPERINTENDENT ABERNATHY who rocks slowly in his chair. At his feet, his 10-year-old daughter MAE ROSE is playing jacks. Her long blonde hair makes her look like a little angel.

Mae Rose considers their faces. Ray and Claude look like they've been to hell and back.

Mae Rose takes a long glance at the prisoners. The men all look away -- except Can't Get Right who stands there smiling innocently. Mae Rose gives him a little wink, then turns her back and bounces up the steps.

Can't Get Right digs in. Claude returns to the sidelines and appeals to the gods. The pitcher winds up and releases a fast ball. Can't Get Right connects with that familiar CRACK! Blocker stands up and watches the ball clear the fence and just keep going.

With his team cheering him on, Can't Get Right trots around the bases. But he's still looking at Mae Rose.

Superintendent Abernathy paces anxiously in front of a white curtain surrounding Mae Rose's bed. Suddenly, Mrs Abernathy staggers out from behind the curtain with a stricken look on her face. She tries to speak, but words fail her. Her legs go wobbly and she faints dead away.

Abernathy drives his sedan up to the bunkhouse. All of his worldly possessions are strapped to the roof. It appears that the Abernathys are leaving town. In the back seat, Mae Rose cradles her baby. Her mother sits next to her. Dillard steps out into the yard to confer with the Superintendent, then turns to address the inmates.

Abernathy holds his newborn grandson up next to Ray's face. Hmm. Scowling, he moves a little further down the line, scrutinizing the features of each man. He pauses in front of Claude, holds up the baby. Maybe. Abernathy stops in front Goldmouth. Holds up the baby. The possibility makes him shudder. He moves on to Can't Get Right. His eyes narrow.

<ABERNATHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know it was somebody from this camp. I can feel it in my bones.

Up and down the line, the men brace themselves for the worst. Can't Get Right just grins. Enraged, Abernathy cocks the revolver. That's when Ray steps forward.

And so it goes down the line, until every last man of Camp 8 has stepped forward to claim kinship with the Superintendent. Even hard-ass Dillard can't help cracking a smile. Disgusted, confused and thoroughly fed up, Abernathy jams the revolver into his belt and climbs into the car. As he guns the engine, Mae Rose gazes out the back window, smiling one last time at the father of her baby. Can't Get Right smiles back.

But Biscuit isn't paying attention. He breaks into a run. Dillard nods to Hoppin' Bob who raises his rifle and draws a bead. But he can't pull the trigger. He lowers his gun.

Shots ring out from the shooter shacks. Biscuit reels from the impact of the bullets and looks down sadly at the blood spreading across his ring-arounds...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Prisoners silently gather at the gunline. Jangle Leg pushes his way through the crowd and crosses the gunline without hesitation. Dillard indicates for the shooters to hold their fire. They train their rifles on Jangle Leg as he strides toward his fallen companion. Jangle Leg gently lifts Biscuit's lifeless body into his big arms and somberly carries him back toward the camp. The CAMERA RISES HIGH OVERHEAD as the prisoners make way for Jangle Leg to cross back over the gunline.

Can't Get Right steps across the gun line. Blocker opens the car door for him. But before he climbs in, Can't Get Right reaches into his pocket and pulls out his rubber ball. With a smile, he tosses it to Claude, who snatches it out of the air.

Blocker tips his hat and climbs behind the wheel. Claude and Ray watch Blocker's car drive off under a red Mississippi sunset. Slowly, the inmates drift back toward the bunkhouse until Ray an Claude are left alone at the gun line.

Suddenly enraged, Ray hauls off and knocks Claude down with a solid right. Surprised, Claude touches his bloody lip.

	Here's a news flash, Ray. We never were friends. We've just been stuck together for 12 years. It's been nothing but bad luck since the moment I ran into you. Every time I look at you I get sick to my stomach thinking about what my life could have been if I'd never bumped into Ray Gibson.

On the porch, Willie, now in his 70s, sits in a wheelchair watching the ball game on a black-and-white television. A TRUSTY waits nearby. Ray, now in his mid-60s, emerges from the bunkhouse lugging a duffle bag.
</DIRECTION>

He gives Willie a slap on the back and nods to the trusty. The trusty wheels the old man across the yard where YOUNG PRISONERS mingle with WIVES and FAMILY MEMBERS sporting the fashions of the early '70s -- Afros, mutton chops, paisley prints and bell-bottom pants.
</DIRECTION>

ACROSS THE YARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looking old-style, Claude sits on the mess hall steps waiting for Sylvia. He catches Willie's eye. The two men nod to each other, an unspoken farewell. Then Claude turns to find Ray looking at him from the bunkhouse steps. Ray and Claude hold each others gaze for a moment. Then Ray heads back into the bunkhouse.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DILLARD'S HOUSE -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Breathless, Claude makes it to the kitchen window and digs his hand into the golden-brown crust, shoving a sloppy fistful of pie into his mouth. More shots ring out. Bullets PING all around him. Grabbing the pie, he darts around the side of the building, out of range. Back against the wall, he drops down on his haunches, snarfing pie like a hungry wolf.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. CAMP 8 YARD -- DAY

A case of empty Coke bottles sits in the middle of the yard, glinting in the hot sun. His face smeared with boysenberry, Claude finishes taking off his boots and socks and steps barefoot onto the bottles.
</DIRECTION>
<DILLARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Comfortable?

	We'll see what those slippers feel like after, say, 24 hours. And if you step down off them bottles -- if one toe so much as touches the dirt -- one of these boys is gonna shoot you dead. Let's see. We need a special man for this job.

</DILLARD>

Ray glances at Claude, then back at Dillard.

<DILLARD>

EXT. CAMP 8 YARD -- SUNDOWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray's been given the same treatment as Claude. Barefoot, balanced on Coke bottles, the two men stand a few feet apart facing each other. A trusty with a rifle keeps an eye on them. After years of silence, the tension reaches the breaking point...

EXT. GREENVILLE BUS STATION -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Claude pulls up in front of the station, steps out of the car and holds the door for Wilkins, who checks his watch.
</DIRECTION>
<WILKINS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know I trust you, Claude.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILKINS>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<WILKINS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be right back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILKINS>
<DIRECTION>
Wilkins heads into the station, leaving Claude alone with the Continental. All around him are the sights, sounds and smells of the free world. A woman rushes into the arms of a man as he climbs off a bus. Across the street is Grandma Dodi's Pork Rib Joint where Cookie never made it to the peach cobbler. A young brother with a boom box walks by. In the street, kids crowd around the back of an ice cream truck. Then Claude catches his reflection in the car window and frowns. When did he get this old? Unnerved, he moves around to the back of the car and pops open the trunk.

<RAY>

	You didn't think I was gonna let you escape alone, did you?

<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I ain't escaping! We're picking up the new super just like I told you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then you're lucky I came along. Doesn't take a visionary to spot a golden opportunity like this. Now help me out of this trunk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You ain't getting out of that trunk.

</CLAUDE>
<RAY>

(Ray struggles out of the trunk)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have the chance right here, right now, I say we go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go where, Ray?

</CLAUDE>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Back to New York for starters.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what will we do when we get there? I'm sixty-five years old, Ray. So are you. What are we gonna do out here? Get married, have kids, settle down? That boat sailed without us, man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This boat's gonna sail without you, too. I don't care if I last one day out here. At least it's one day of freedom. Now gimme those keys.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forget about that. You run if you want to, but you're not taking this car.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Claude, man, I'm serious. Give me those keys.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I ain't spending a month in the hole so you can take a joy ride.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't make me take them away from you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, there's Wilkins!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
Ray looks, Claude clocks him. Ray slumps back into the trunk. Claude stuffs Ray's legs back into the trunk and slams the lid.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's driving now, bitch?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up just as Wilkins and the new superintendent exit the bus station. Warren Pike's hair has gone grey and he's 40 years older, but there's no mistaking the former sheriff of Natchez County. He still bears a nasty scar on his cheek from a wound inflicted long ago.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLAUDE'S POV -- Pike appears as a young man in his sheriff's uniform striding slowly toward him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Claude blinks and looks again. Pike has returned to his old self as he and Wilkins step up.
</DIRECTION>
<PIKE>
<DIRECTION>
(dropping his bags)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There you go, boy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIKE>
<DIRECTION>
Oblivious, Pike climbs into the back seat. Wilkins nods to Claude.
</DIRECTION>
<WILKINS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Claude, time to go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILKINS>
<DIRECTION>
Claude snaps to it, grabbing the bags. He considers opening the trunk, but decides to carry them around to the front seat with him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. KITCHEN PORCH -- DUSK

Backs to the CAMERA, Ray and Claude urinate, presumably off the porch.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sure it was him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some faces you just don't forget. Warren Pike's is one of 'em.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't like it, I don't like it one bit. We shoulda taken that car when we had the opportunity. We'd be half way to New York by now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'd be in the hole by now. Hey, man, you're peeing on my shoe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. Simultaneously, they shake and zip. Claude bends down and picks up a bowl of gumbo, placing it on a tray next to an identical one.
	</DIALOGUE>

INT. DINING ROOM -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wilkins pours a frosty drink and offers it to Pike.
</DIRECTION>
<WILKINS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lemonade?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILKINS>
<PIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I prefer bourbon.

</PIKE>
<WILKINS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, I don't keep any liquor in the house.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILKINS>
<PIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, fortunately, I carry my own.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIKE>
<DIRECTION>
Pike pulls a flask from his jacket and tilts it high. Claude enters from the kitchen with the two steaming bowls of gumbo.
</DIRECTION>
<WILKINS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hunting's been pretty good on the farm the last few years. It's one of the perks of the job. If you're interested, tomorrow I could show you some of my favorite spots.

</WILKINS>
<PIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't have to twist my arm.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(digging in)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say now, that gumbo has quite a kick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIKE>
<WILKINS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Claude. That'll be all for tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILKINS>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goodnight, Mr. Wilkins. Mr. Pike.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<WILKINS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goodnight, Claude.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILKINS>
<DIRECTION>
Pike nods coldly. Claude steps back into the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<PIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you don't mind my saying, you seem mighty familiar with your house boy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIKE>
<WILKINS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I believe in treating the convicts with respect, if that's what you mean.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILKINS>
<PIKE>
<DIRECTION>
(sarcastic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Respect? Well, isn't that progressive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIKE>
<WILKINS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If somebody deserves respect, Mr. Pike, they receive it from me, convict or no convict.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILKINS>
<DIRECTION>
Pike curls his lip with disdain before taking a healthy spoonful of gumbo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MARSH -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Claude and Ray beat the bullrushes with switches. Amid a flutter of wings, three pheasants take to the air. Wilkins fires first, knocking one out the sky. Pike pulls off two rounds, playing clean up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FIELD -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray and Claude dump their game bags into the back of a pickup truck. Nearby, Pike drains his flask while Wilkins scrapes mud off his boots. The breeze picks up, clouds fill the sky.
</DIRECTION>
<WILKINS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, that's a pretty good haul. What do you say, Mr. Pike? Ready to call it a day?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILKINS>
<DIRECTION>
Pike pulls a gold watch from his pocket and releases the face plate. A familiar mechanical tune floats on the gathering breeze. Ray turns around slowly. His eyes fall on the watch in Pike's hand. His daddy's watch. In Pike's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<PIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, it's getting late. I could sure use a bath.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIKE>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a real nice watch you got there, sir. Fancy old thing even plays a little tune.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<PIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, it's special. They don't make 'em like this anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIKE>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure don't. Mind if I ask where you got it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<PIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, my wife gave it to me on our anniversary some years back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIKE>
<DIRECTION>
Claude looks at the watch, then at Ray. Uh oh.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Must have been some time ago. Maybe forty years?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<PIKE>
<DIRECTION>
(eyes narrowing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something like that, yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIKE>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She give you that scar, too?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
Pike thrusts the barrel of his gun up under Ray's chin.
</DIRECTION>
<PIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I oughta shoot you for that comment, boy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIKE>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like you shot Winston Hancock?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
Wilkins turns to see Pike holding Ray at gunpoint.
</DIRECTION>
<WILKINS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's going on here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILKINS>
<PIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm afraid I'm gonna have to teach this uppity nigger a lesson in manners.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIKE>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's Mr. Uppity Nigger to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
Ray grabs the barrel of the shotgun and slams it into Pike's face. Pike rolls over and freezes, staring down the barrel of his own gun now in Ray's hands. Confused, Wilkins points his gun at Ray.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cool it, Ray. You're gonna get us in a lot of trouble.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<WILKINS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's right, Gibson. Put down the gun and we'll work this out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILKINS>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm gonna work this man's brains out the back of his head.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<PIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shoot him, Wilkins!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIKE>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't shoot, sir. I can deal with this.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(cautiously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ray, buddy, you don't want to shoot this white man. See, you do that, they'll kill you for sure. And it's not that I like you or anything, but I've kinda gotten used to having you around.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's got my daddy's watch, Claude. I always knew whoever took that watch killed Winston Hancock. And that was you, Mr. Pike.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<PIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's crazy. Don't listen to him, Wilkins.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIKE>
<WILKINS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you realize what your saying, Gibson?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILKINS>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That watch was the only thing my daddy ever gave me. It meant the world to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<PIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goddamn it, Wilkins, would you please just shoot the nigger!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIKE>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He shoots me, I swear I'll take you with me! I just want to hear you say it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<WILKINS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is there any truth to what he's saying, Pike?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILKINS>
<PIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What difference does it make? Natchez was better off without Winston Hancock! Who cares if a couple of no- account bootleggers went to jail for his killing? At least the state of Mississippi got 40 years of cheap labor out of the deal!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIKE>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forty years of cheap labor! Gimme that gun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
Claude grabs for the gun.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I'm gonna kill him --

</RAY>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, believe me, I'm gonna kill him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
Claude yanks the gun free and points it right in Pike's face. Wilkins trains his gun on Claude. But the moment passes. Claude lowers the gun. Bewildered, Wilkins does the same.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's because you're soft. Gimme the gun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What'd you say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said you're soft.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't call me soft, I hate it when you call me that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
Ray mouths the word -- "soft." Claude clenches his jaw, points the gun and pulls the trigger. Click.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pike smirks and pulls a small gun from his boot. But as he raises it -- BLAM! Pike is hurled backward by a shotgun blast. Shocked, Ray and Claude look at Wilkins, his gun still smoking in his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a significant beat, Ray reaches down and gingerly retrieves his daddy's gold pocket watch.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I believe this is mine.

EXT. SUPERINTENDENT'S MANSION -- DAY

A gurney carrying Pike's body is lifted into the back of a van by two COUNTY CORONERS. Nearby, a distraught Wilkins tells his story to a couple of SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES.

One of the deputies pats Wilkins sympathetically on the back. Then he and his partner put away their notebooks and head for their vehicle. Wilkins heads up the steps and into the house.
</DIRECTION>
<WILKINS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I think they bought it. One of the deputies belongs to my church.

</WILKINS>
<DIRECTION>
Visibly shaken, Wilkins takes a seat, wiping the sweat from his brow with a handkerchief.
</DIRECTION>
<WILKINS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I realize there's no way... There's nothing I can say to make up for forty years... I'll have Charlotte prepare those pardon papers right away.

Wilkins winces and swallows a couple of pills from his box.

Claude glances around to ensure that he's not overheard.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, Ray, I've been chewing on what you said this afternoon. I think I got a plan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
Ray gives Claude a long look.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you trying to tell me after all this time you finally have a plan for busting out of here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shh! Is that so hard to believe?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't tell me, I don't want to hear it. It's probably all fucked up, anyway.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't want to hear it, you don't want to hear it. There's no shame in that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's too late for plans.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never thought I'd hear Ray Gibson say that. Hell with you then. You'd only slow me down anyway.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
Ray turns away as Claude walks off. A DODDERING INMATE stands nearby slurping on Jell-O. His robe hangs open.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, man, cover that shit up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
Disgusted, Ray discards his own Jell-O. He pulls out his daddy's pocket watch and checks the time. The little mechanical tune nags at him. He snaps the lid shut and considers the watch resting in the palm of his hand.

EXT. INFIRMARY -- NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
The building is dark. But then, through a first-floor window, we see the unmistakable orange glow of a fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. INFIRMARY -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An ALARM BLARES as the place fills with smoke. Wearing a robe and slippers, Nurse Humphries runs among the prisoners, helping them out the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. INFIRMARY -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coughing and disheveled, Ray emerges onto the lawn pushing Willie in the wheelchair. As other prisoners evacuate the building, Ray looks around for Claude, but he doesn't see him. Nurse Humphries takes a quick head count.
</DIRECTION>
<NURSE_HUMPHRIES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is everyone here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NURSE_HUMPHRIES>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, where's Claude? I don't see Claude!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<NURSE_HUMPHRIES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay calm, Ray. We'll find him. Claude! Has anyone seen Claude?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NURSE_HUMPHRIES>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He must still be in there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
Grimly, Ray starts toward the burning infirmary. Nurse Humphries holds him back.
</DIRECTION>
<NURSE_HUMPHRIES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait for the firemen!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NURSE_HUMPHRIES>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It'll be too late.

<NURSE_HUMPHRIES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't go in there, Ray! You'll never make it!

<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going in for him. He'd do the same for me.

Ray shakes her off and runs up the steps, disappearing into the burning building.

INT. INFIRMARY -- NIGHT

Ray dodges flames as he presses into the inferno.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. INFIRMARY -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nurse Humphries, Willie and the rest of the inmates watch grimly as flames engulf the building. Nobody could survive this blaze. From the highway comes the siren wail of approaching fire engines. But it's too late. Sparks erupt into the night sky as the roof collapses...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. INFIRMARY -- DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fire trucks pull away from the smoldering ruins. A local REPORTER interviews witnesses. INVESTIGATORS comb through the wreckage, making notes. COUNTY CORONERS pull a couple of gurneys from the back of their van.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. INFIRMARY RUINS -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Superintendent Bill Burke is led through the destruction by a FIRE INSPECTOR. They approach the coroners as they finish zipping up two body bags.
</DIRECTION>
<BURKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did it start?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURKE>
<FIRE_INSPECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Probably old wires. The place was a tinderbox just waiting to go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FIRE_INSPECTOR>
<BURKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess we should have torn this old building down a long time ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURKE>
<FIRE_INSPECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gibson made it this far before he was probably overcome by smoke. From the look of things, Banks never even made it out of bed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FIRE_INSPECTOR>

Burke watches solemnly as the coroners wheel the bodies past him.

Jake and Leon shake their heads and look at the two fresh graves.

	Nigger, you crying?

</LEON>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hell, no! I just got something in my eye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's alright for a man to cry once in awhile. Just don't make a habit of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<LEON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Willie, what was Claude's plan, anyway?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEON>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing to it, really. Claude figured they could steal a couple of bodies from the morgue. They got a couple of crackers working there don't know their asses from their elbows. Then they was gonna set fire to the infirmary and make it look like those bodies was them that got stuck inside. Claude figured during the commotion, it wouldn't be too hard to slip onto one of the fire trucks and hang tight until it rolled right on out of here in the morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
The young inmates share a look, then glance into the graves, then look back at Willie.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What makes you think it didn't work?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never said it didn't work.

</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Leon and Jake do the arithmetic. You can almost hear the gears grinding under the strain.
</DIRECTION>
<LEON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You trying to tell us that's not Ray and Claude in those boxes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEON>
<DIRECTION>
Willie starts to chuckle and sets his electric wheel chair on auto-pilot, leaving the young inmates to guess at the truth.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you think about that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<LEON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think that old man lost his marbles about a hundred years ago. Come on, let's get this over with.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEON>

They pick up their shovels and go back to work burying the caskets.

INT. GREENVILLE FIRE STATION -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA MOVES PAST a FIREMAN hosing down the truck, past another group of soot-stained FIREMEN eating breakfast, and pauses in front of two lockers. A couple of FIREMEN emerge from the showers wrapped in towels and open their lockers. They share a look.
</DIRECTION>
<FIREMAN_1>

	Alright, which of you hambones took our clothes?

EXT. YANKEE STADIUM -- DAY -- WIDE SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scalpers sell tickets. Vendors hawk souvenirs. Fans stream up from the subway and through the gates. Somebody is singing "The Star-Spangled Banner."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STANDS -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the middle of a capacity crowd, a VENDOR fixes two hot dogs and passes them to a KID at the end of an aisle. The kid passes them to the MAN next to him, and so on down the line.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA FOLLOWS the hot dogs from face to face, some old, some young, some black, some white -- it's New York City, after all -- and finally the hot dogs arrive in a pair of old, calloused black hands. Ray passes one of the dogs to Claude.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't eat this.

</CLAUDE>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>

</RAY>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I saw that hot dog guy in the bathroom urinating. He didn't wash his hands.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
Ray and Claude glance around confused as the wave rolls through their section of the bleachers. What the fuck? Claude inspects his hot dog.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just put some mustard on it and eat it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't get ketchup?

</CLAUDE>

Ray snatches back the hot dog.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What am I gonna eat?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
Ray is suddenly young again.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have my ice cream.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
Claude takes the ice cream. He, too, is suddenly young again.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
They look at each other and share a laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hell of a day for a ballgame, huh, Claude?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hell of a day, Ray. Yankees are on fire.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
Claude pops the top on his ice cream. Suddenly, they are both old again.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, this ain't gonna work either. It's half chocolate, half vanilla.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're touching.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA begins to pull back.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you don't eat that ice cream right now, I'm gonna strangle you until you are completely dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah? You and what army?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Next thing, you're gonna be complaining about the seats.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, if you must know, they could be closer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn, I shoulda let Spanky Johnson drown you in the river when I had the chance.

"Pipe downs" etc. from the people around them.

	I know you're not talking to me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, he's on medication...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA PULLS BACK as the arguing continues, just like the old days. MUSIC UP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
