EXT. ERIE HOSPITAL FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA MOVES THROUGH a tangled jungle of razor wire, finally COMING INTO VIEW of a foreboding, fortress-like old institution, surrounded by towers and gun turrets. Screaming and horrible laughter is heard from within...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON a sign that reads "Erie Hospital for the Criminally Insane" ... This is where the worst killers and psychos go.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAMERA PANS THE EXPRESSIONLESS FACES of the REVIEW BOARD as CASANOVA FRANKENSTEIN sits across from them. Dressed in an immaculately tailored prison smock (with "Casanova" exquisitely embroidered above the pocket), he sits contritely as DOCTOR EMMET BIERCE, the hospital's fatherly Chief of Psychiatry, presents his case.
</DIRECTION>
<BIERCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No one can deny the horrendous nature of Mr. Frankenstein's crimes, but in the twenty years he has been with us, I have never seen a patient turn his energies to more productive use.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIERCE>
<DIRECTION>
CASANOVA, the picture of remorse and repentance.
</DIRECTION>
<BIERCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just look at his accomplishments... three volumes of poetry, two rock operas, a sculpture garden, four romance novels... and who can forget his touching portrayal of Billy Bigelow in our all-psychotic production of "Carousel"...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIERCE>
<DIRECTION>
ON SEVERAL OF THE BOARD getting misty eyed at the memory of that brilliant performance...
</DIRECTION>
<BIERCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Directed by our own Doctor Anabel Leek.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIERCE>
<DIRECTION>
ON DOCTOR ANABEL LEEK, the hospital's icily beautiful, ultra cool, top shrink.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A moment later Casanova addresses them... His manner is charming, sincere, his voice soft, filled with emotion. He is a master of seduction.
</DIRECTION>
<CASANOVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twenty years ago I was a lost soul. Loveless...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(with a son-like glance at Doctor Bierce)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fatherless...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(chokes on the word)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A... psycho!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(breaks down sobbing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh! How could I have done it? The murder... the mayhem... all of those lovely young girls!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(weeping, a brilliant performance)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry! I'm SO SO SORRY!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASANOVA>
<DIRECTION>
Doctor Bierce wipes the tears from his eyes. Reactions from the board, moved, as Casanova weeps convulsively. Doctor Leek shows no reaction.
</DIRECTION>
<CASANOVA>
<DIRECTION>
(pulls himself together)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But my deeds have been done, and my youth is gone, and we can only go forward in this cruel world... and if I have learned anything from my wretched life it is that... When you walk through a storm, keep your head held high...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(singing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And don't be afraid of the dark...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASANOVA>
<DIRECTION>
Tears plop dawn the cheeks of the review board as the FULLY ORCHESTRATED STRAINS OF "WHEN YOU WALK THROUGH A STORM" SWELL...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SERIES OF SHOTS - AS THE MUSIC CONTINUES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hand stamps Casanova's file "CURED"... Casanova shakes hands and embraces the tearful members of the review board, finishing with a paternal hug from Doctor Bierce.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In his cell a guard delivers Casanova his favorite old disco suit (that's been waiting far him for twenty years).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Casanova, dressed in the suit, walks down the central aisle of the lock-up... A moment later he steps out of the massive gates of the hospital, and takes his first deep breath of freedom... while in an office window high above Bierce and the members of the review board stand watching, very proud...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But suddenly THE MUSIC CHANGES TO SEVENTIES DISCO as a black Ferrari drives up, and Doctor Leek, now dressed very sexily, gets out... As the review board watches in stunned silence, Casanova and Anabel perform a nifty little disco twirl, finishing with a very lewd kiss...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bierce, watching, realizes he's been duped... as Casanova, grinning up at him, puts a long gold chain (his favorite weapon) around his neck... Bierce, horrified, picks up the telephone... as Casanova and Anabel get in the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE CAR - A MOMENT LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Casanova and Anabel drive off. The massive old hospital is seen through the rear window behind them, as Casanova calmly looks at his watch...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON HIS WATCH -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the second hand just swings toward the twelve. It is exactly twelve noon...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK ON CASANOVA -
</DIRECTION>
<CASANOVA>
<DIRECTION>
(almost wistfully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASANOVA>
<DIRECTION>
And the hospital EXPLODES in a HUGE FIREBALL that completely consumes it.
</DIRECTION>
<CASANOVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those gas leaks can be murder.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASANOVA>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE ROAD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Ferrari drives past and the CAMERA HOLDS ON a sign that reads "We1come to Champion City, home of Captain Amazing". The city itself, a crumbling rust belt metropolis (ala Detroit) can be seen stretched out along the shore of Lake Champion off in the distance...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE CAR - CONTINUOUS - ON CASANOVA
</DIRECTION>
<CASANOVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASANOVA>
<DIRECTION>
BACK ON THE ROAD - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Ferrari drives under a much larger billboard that looms over the road, showing a picture of Captain Amazing himself, a square jawed classic superhero, staring fiercely into the camera. The caption reads "Crime. Don't even think about it."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TRAIN YARDS OF CHAMPION CITY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Letters read "Six months later"...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the CAMERA EXPLORES the desolate muddy terrain of the train yards, CRUISING past piles of tires and abandoned train cars...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PICKS UP a battered van as it drives through the yard, then pulls up beside an old boxcar. The back of the van is thrown open, a ramp is thrown down, and THE RED EYES, a gang of vicious small time thieves (all of whom wear sunglasses with red lenses) start unloading their night's haul... RED EYE 1 drives a golf cart, with clubs, down the ramp.
</DIRECTION>
<RED_EYE_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Golf anyone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED_EYE_1>
<DIRECTION>
Several more Red Eyes emerge carrying a sawn off bike rack with bikes still attached, a barber pole, a Virgin Mary lawn statue, and a top of the line baby stroller... while their leader, BIG RED, stands in the door to the boxcar, watching approvingly.
</DIRECTION>
<RED_EYE_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not a bad night's work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED_EYE_2>
<BIG_RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who said crime don't pay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIG_RED>
<DIRECTION>
The Red Eyes laugh... as Red Eye 3 takes the cover off the baby stroller and sees... that there's a BABY still in it.
</DIRECTION>
<RED_EYE_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Boss, we got a stowaway.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED_EYE_3>
<DIRECTION>
The crooks gather around the baby, a jolly little kid who just laughs at them.
</DIRECTION>
<RED_EYE_4>
<DIRECTION>
(about to slug him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who you laughin' at, punk?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED_EYE_4>
<RED_EYE_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's just a tyke. Lighten up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED_EYE_2>
<RED_EYE_5>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's kinda cute.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED_EYE_5>
<RED_EYE_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you like drool.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED_EYE_3>
<RED_EYE_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, why don't we sell him back to his parents? For a million bucks!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED_EYE_2>
<DIRECTION>
The others think that's a great idea, but Big Red doesn't.
</DIRECTION>
<BIG_RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what if he rats on us?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIG_RED>
<DIRECTION>
The others hadn't thought of that.
</DIRECTION>
<RED_EYE_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what should we do with him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED_EYE_3>
<BIG_RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stick a brick in his Pampers and dump him in the lake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIG_RED>
<DIRECTION>
The others think that's a good idea and look around for a brick.
</DIRECTION>
<RED_EYE_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, kid, you're goin' for a swim.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED_EYE_3>
<DIRECTION>
But suddenly there is another presence... A man in a blue turban and cape with the initials "BR" on his chest has appeared... He is THE BLUE RAJA.
</DIRECTION>
<RAJA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not so fast, gentlemen--and I use the term loosely... Unhand that youngster...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAJA>
<DIRECTION>
Another man steps into the light. He wears a construction helmet and mask. There is an "S" on his chest, and he carries an old shovel. He is THE SHOVELER.
</DIRECTION>
<SHOVELER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or you're mulch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHOVELER>
<DIRECTION>
He brandishes his shovel for effect. The Red Eyes look at these two, highly amused.
</DIRECTION>
<BIG_RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you guys supposed to be... superheroes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIG_RED>
<DIRECTION>
A third man steps out. His costume is less dramatic than the others. He wears only an old leather jacket and a faded, torn shirt with flames on it, but the fierce look on his face and the atrociousness of his haircut make it very clear that he is the craziest and most dangerous of the three. He is MISTER FURIOUS.
</DIRECTION>
<FURIOUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We ARE superheroes!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FURIOUS>
<BIG_RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? Did you mother make those costumes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIG_RED>
<DIRECTION>
The crooks howl with laughter.
</DIRECTION>
<BIG_RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is our territory. Beat it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIG_RED>
<FURIOUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Over YOUR dead body.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FURIOUS>
<DIRECTION>
Big Red turns to the others and shakes with pretended fear.
</DIRECTION>
<BIG_RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	0ooooo, he's scary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIG_RED>
<DIRECTION>
The Red Eyes laugh, but suddenly, a small silver projectile whizzes through the air and implants itself in Big Red's backside. He howls with pain, pulls it out and examines it... It's a silver dessert fork.
</DIRECTION>
<BIG_RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A fork!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIG_RED>
<DIRECTION>
The Raja holds up his hands, each of which hold a spread of silver forks.
</DIRECTION>
<RAJA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And there's plenty more where that came from.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAJA>
<DIRECTION>
Big Red gives a shrill whistle, and a dozen more Red Eyes step out of an old caboose... including MIKEY, a four hundred pound behemoth. He is eating a container of Ben and Jerry's like it was an ice cream cone, taking huge bites out of it, container and all.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RAJA AND SHOVELER, reacting... Gulp. This was more than they'd bargained for. But Furious just growls; he's game.
</DIRECTION>
<BIG_RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	GET 'EM!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIG_RED>
<DIRECTION>
The Red Eyes attack... Mister Furious goes into a furious face; his hair stands out straight and he rushes right into the oncoming crooks...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Red Eye takes a swing at the Shoveler--but he simply puts up his shovel and lets the crook slug the shovel's pan. The crook yelps with pain and shakes his battered hand... as the Raja fends off crooks, poking them with salad forks... and the baby sits in his stroller, watching and laughing, really enjoying the show. (There's no real martial artistry or teamwork here; this is a classic back alley brouhaha.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But there's too many of then... The Raja goes down under swinging fists... and so does the Shoveler...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Furious holds his own, taking out crooks with powerful lefts and rights--until Mikey runs him down like a truck, falling right on top of him and crushing him under his massive weight.
</DIRECTION>
<RED_EYES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Crush him, Mikey!... Mash him!... Mush him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED_EYES>
<FURIOUS>
<DIRECTION>
(barely audible under all that meat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that all you got?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FURIOUS>
<RED_EYES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He wants more!... Squish him!... Finish him off!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED_EYES>
<FURIOUS>
<DIRECTION>
(faintly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your mother!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FURIOUS>
<DIRECTION>
Mikey, sweating, bears down... but suddenly, a calm, very authoritative voice is heard.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(0.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is there a problem?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Everything suddenly stops, as the Red Eyes look up and see... CAPTAIN AMAZING standing on tap of the boxcar, hands on hips, framed in the light at the moon, his biceps bulging, his state of the art physique sculpted body armor gleaming in the moonlight, his cape wafting heroically in the wind. He is superhero perfection incarnate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE RED EYES as their viciousness turns instantly to panic...
</DIRECTION>
<RED_EYES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	IT'S CAPTAIN AMAZING!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED_EYES>
<DIRECTION>
Big Red and a couple others try to run for it, but Amazing leaps ca- like off the boxcar and is on them in a flash. As the baby claps his hands in delight, and our three heroes watch in beat-up awe, Amazing deftly takes out the crooks with expert punches and effortlessly delivered elbows and kicks. He is the consumate superhero, and he doesn't even break a sweat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The remaining Red Eyes drop to their knees and throw up their hands in surrender.
</DIRECTION>
<RED_EYES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We give!... We're sorry!... We had terrible childhoods!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Etc.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Police cars and a TV truck come screeching into the train yard... and the scene is suddenly flooded vith light and swarming with cops and reporters...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Our three heroes try to approach Captain Amazing (who still looks fresh as a daisy).
</DIRECTION>
<RAJA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice work, Captain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAJA>
<DIRECTION>
But Amazing just walks past them, ignoring them completely, as if they didn't even exist. He goes to greet DAWN WONG (Champion City's answer to Connie Chung).
</DIRECTION>
<AMAZING>
<DIRECTION>
(turning on the old superhero charm)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi. Dawn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMAZING>
<DAWN>
<DIRECTION>
(putty in his hands, pudding in his bowl)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looks like you've done it again, Captain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAWN>
<AMAZING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's what I do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMAZING>
<DIRECTION>
Our heroes just watch, feeling ignored, humiliated. Furious growls. Suddenly, TWO COPS are accosting them.
</DIRECTION>
<COP_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, show's over. Move it. On your way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP_1>
<RAJA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a minute, Officers. You don't understand-- we're superheroes, and we just busted up this gang.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAJA>
<COP_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? Let me guess-you're Towel Head and he's...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(meaning the Shoveler)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Captain Pooper Scooper!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP_1>
<DIRECTION>
The cops crack up. Furious growls at them. The cops yank out their nightsticks.
</DIRECTION>
<COP_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! Move it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP_1>
<COP_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get a life!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP_2>
<COP_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And leave crime fighting to the real thing!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP_1>
<DIRECTION>
Shoveler and Raja pull Furious away before he gets into real trouble... The cops watch as our three heroes disappear into the night.
</DIRECTION>
<COP_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wannabes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP_1>
<COP_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pathetic.
	</DIALOGUE>

EXT. THE LAKESIDE DINER - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An inner city greasy spoon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE DINER - CONTINUOUS - CLOSE ON A TV SCREEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
on which Captain Amazing, the laughing baby in his arms, is being interviewed by Dawn Wong. He's playing the cutsy photo op for all its worth, gootchy-gooing the kid, etc. Dawn is creaming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Our three heroes sit at a booth in the back of the diner, watching the tube...
</DIRECTION>
<RAJA>
<DIRECTION>
(nursing a sore jaw)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He doesn't miss a trick, does he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAJA>
<FURIOUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What a jerk--and like nobody knows who he really is!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FURIOUS>
<SHOVELER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh don't start that again--
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHOVELER>
<FURIOUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	LOOK!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FURIOUS>
<DIRECTION>
Furious picks up the newspaper on which there is a photo of a good looking guy in a tux at a benefit... The headline reads "Lance Hunt Hosts Benefit." He holds the picture up next to the television, so the faces of Lance Hunt and Captain Amazing are side by side. It is obviously the same guy.
</DIRECTION>
<FURIOUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's Lance Hunt! Just take off the glasses-- and it's him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FURIOUS>
<RAJA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's a vague similarity.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAJA>
<FURIOUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A vague similarity? IT'S THE SAME GUY!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FURIOUS>
<SHOVELER>
<DIRECTION>
(downing some aspirin)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	0h, who gives a damn who he is? I can't take this anymore. Night after night we're on the streets, busting our humps--and for what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHOVELER>
<RAJA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We take the licks and he gets the chicks.

	How long do you have to chase a dream before you realize it's not gonna happen?
	</DIALOGUE>

	We need a break, that's all! Nobody'd ever heard of him until he busted Casanova Frankenstein!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FURIOUS>
<RAJA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But look at him... and look at us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAJA>
<SHOVELER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The camera loves him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHOVELER>
<DIRECTION>
A depressed silence. Furious turns his attention to the napkin dispenser.
</DIRECTION>
<FURIOUS>

(furious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do they always fill stuff these things so full you can't pull 'em out without ripping 'em!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(rips one out)
</DIRECTION>
<RAJA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I lost another fork tonight. She's getting suspicious, I know it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAJA>
<FURIOUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So why don't you just tell her!

	Leave him alone. She's his mother, not yours.

CLOSE ON FURIOUS, smitten by her, but almost afraid to look at her. Under all that rage, he's in fact shy.

A moment later as Monica walks away, Furious can't help but watch her. The Raja replaces the diner's dinnerware with the good stuff from his coat.
</DIRECTION>
<RAJA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She likes you.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What does it matter? Women just want to control you--and talk about their feelings. They want to know why you're angry all the time--and what can they can do to help--so you tell them there's nothing--nothing--just leave me alone--but they bug you and they bug you and they bug you--until you just can't stand it anymore!--so you finally open up--you pop like a blister--and it all comes spewing out--all your emotions--your feelings--your fears--all of it!

Overgrown with weeds, home to an extended family of pigeons, its fighting days (if it ever had any) are over.

Only Furious holds his own. He grabs a pipe away from one of them and swings fiercely, keeping the others off. Suddenly, the Disco Boys pull back. Furious doesn't know why, until he turns and sees...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Casanova, standing right behind him, smiling.
</DIRECTION>
<CASANOVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASANOVA>
<DIRECTION>
With a cat-like move Casanova slashes his gold chain viciously--and repeatedly--across Furious' face. Furious, stunned with pain, lunges at Casanova, who neatly steps aside, then catches him with a fast combination of spinning disco kicks. Finally he lassos the chain around Furious' neck, and pulls it tight, strangling him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE DISCO BOYS, watching, snapping their fingers with admiration...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Casanova releases Furious, who slumps to the ground. Casanova steps away, and the Disco Boys gather around Furious and kick him viciously... as Casanova and Tony P watch, amused, chuckling.

EXT. JUST OUTSIDE THE MANSION - A MOMENT LATER

The Disco Boys drag our heroes through the gate and throw them like bags of garbage into the street... where thay lie in a moaning, agonized, semi-conscious heap.

<DIRECTION>
INT. THE DINER - LATER - CLOSE ON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Furious, rubbing his neck; a thin red mark runs around it. The three of them are sitting at their usual table, in very bad shape, moaning and groaning... Monica approaches. She's made them ice packs and cold compresses.

	But there's only three of us, and he's got the entire brotherhood of evil at his disposal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAJA>
<FURIOUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then maybe it's time for us to form our own brotherhood... a brotherhood of righteous, crime fighting, skull cracking, Disco Boy bashing, warriors of the night!

They take a long moment to ponder this.
</DIRECTION>
<FURIOUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... there's the Spleen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FURIOUS>

Shoveler and Raja make disgusted noises.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Sounds good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FURIOUS>
<RAJA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No one's sure that he actually exists, but they say he can be contacted by leaving a message on a crumpled up napkin at the Tacky Taco down by the bus station.

A funky Mexican restaurant by the bus station.

INT. THE RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Our heroes, in normal clothing, have just finished a taco lunch. Furious is writing a mssage on a napkin with a ballpoint pen.
</DIRECTION>
<FURIOUS>

CLOSE ON THE NOTE -

A teenage boy's room, decorated to the max with models and posters of the great superheroes: Batman, Spiderman, Captain Amazing, etc. INVISIBLE BOY, about fifteen, is being interviewed by the Raja, Mister Furious, and the Shoveler.
</DIRECTION>
<FURIOUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, let me get this straight. You have the power to become invisible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FURIOUS>
<INVISIBLE_BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INVISIBLE_BOY>
<RAJA>

</RAJA>
<INVISIBLE_BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.

</INVISIBLE_BOY>
<FURIOUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If someone looks at you, you immediately become visible again.

</FURIOUS>
<INVISIBLE_BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.

	So you're only invisible, when abuolutely no one is looking at you?

</RAJA>
<INVISIBLE_BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INVISIBLE_BOY>
<FURIOUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So how do you know that you've ever been invisible?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FURIOUS>
<INVISIBLE_BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INVISIBLE_BOY>
<DIRECTION>
Our heroes are less than impressed.
</DIRECTION>
<FURIOUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, kid, we've got a lot of heroes to interview--
	</DIALOGUE>
</FURIOUS>
<INVISIBLE_BOY>
<DIRECTION>
(desperate)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know I haven't got it entirely worked out yet, but I've always dreamed of becoming a superhero... Weren't you guys ever a kid? Didn't you ever need someone to just give you a chance?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INVISIBLE_BOY>
<DIRECTION>
ON OUR HEROES, looking around the room... and softening up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE DINER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Our heroes sit at their usual table along with Invisible Boy and a weird looking guy in a greasy, stained yellow superhero outfit. Across his chest in falling off stick on letters it reads "THE SPLEEN", and that's exactly who he is. Furious, the Raja, and Shoveler sit as far away from him as possible. He is a totally noxious, hyperactive person... and he is thrilled to be there.
</DIRECTION>
<SPLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boy I can't tell you how thrilled I was when you guys called--You gonna eat that pickle?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(sucks it in)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've always dreamed of being a member of the a real superhero team--and to have friends--real friends--I mean guys I could live with--sleep with--die with--eat with...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPLEEN>
<DIRECTION>
He puts the mustard dispenser to his lips and squeezes it straight into his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<SPLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love mustard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPLEEN>
<DIRECTION>
Furious, Raja, and the Shoveler react; they can't believe they've actually invited this guy to join their group.
</DIRECTION>
<INVISIBLE_BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what exactly is your superpower?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INVISIBLE_BOY>
<SPLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, when I was a kid I grew up on Love Canal- -remember that?--and my brothers and I used to go swimming in it--make Kool-Aid out of it-- stuff like that. Anyway my brothers all died, but I lived, and I grew all these like weird organs that have never been seen in humans before. So now I can do things like this!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPLEEN>
<DIRECTION>
He leans over the table and lets just a little tiny drop of spittle dribble onto the table...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON THE TABLE -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the spittle burns a hole in the Formica.
</DIRECTION>
<SPLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cool, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPLEEN>
<DIRECTION>
The Spleen inadvertently gives the tiniest little burp, and our three heroes duck out of the way or under the table.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	FURIOUS, RAJA, & SHOVELER Watch it!... Look out!... Whoa!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The people in the next booth give a cry of revulsion, put their hands to their mouths, and immediately leave.
</DIRECTION>
<SPLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPLEEN>
<SHOVELER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, why don't you just put a cork in it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHOVELER>
<SPLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I tried that once. The cork melted.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPLEEN>
<DIRECTION>
THE SAME - AFTER DINNER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Our heroes mull their situation over coffee. Monica freshens their cups. The Spleen squirts mustard in his coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<SHOVELER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's just not enough of us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHOVELER>
<FURIOUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But we know they're out there. Hundreds--maybe thousands of lonely, unknown superheroes, who desperately need a cause...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FURIOUS>
<RAJA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And a social life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAJA>
<SHOVELER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but how do we get to them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHOVELER>
<SPLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Obscene phone calls?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPLEEN>
<DIRECTION>
They ignore that suggestion.
</DIRECTION>
<MONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you throw a barbecue?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(moves off to another table)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON OUR HEROES, realizing that's it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. INVISIBLE BOY'S ROOM - NIGHT - WITH MUSIC
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Invisible Boy sits at the desk in his room, writing immaculate little notes on small file cards. (He's made a whole pile of them.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON THE NOTE -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
which reads "Got superpowers? Want to fight evil? Then JOIN US and let's PARTY HEARTY! Beer! Burgers! Babes!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SERIES OF SHOTS - MUSIC CONTINUES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as our heroes post these notes all over the city, in places where lonely superheroes night find them...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Raja posts a note on the door of a comic book store...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Shoveler posts a note on the bulletin board at a bowling alley...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Furious tapes the note to the cracked glass of a vandalized phone booth...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At an abandoned drive-in movie theater... Invisible Boy walks through the empty lot, taping a note to each of the old speaker posts...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A White Castle hamburger joint... Inside the pay toilet Spleen is scratching something on the wall with a nail. He stops and admires his handiwork, and we see that he has engraved the entire message on the wall...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
END MUSIC.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SHOVELER'S BACKYARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small, typical working class backyard. A round, aluminum above ground pool. A Weber grill with burgers on it. Unopened packages of hamburger rolls. An old Vic Damon record plays on a boom box. The Spleen floats around on a rubber raft in the pool.
</DIRECTION>
<SPLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on in! The water's great!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPLEEN>
<DIRECTION>
In fact, the water is turning a yellowish green... The rest of our heroes sit around on cheap folding chairs. No superheroes have shown up. The Shoveler, at the grill, serves burgers to his kids, who stand in line waiting for them.
</DIRECTION>
<BUTCH>
<DIRECTION>
(heavy on the sarcasm)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great picnic, Dad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<EDDIE_JR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Big turnout.

<ROLAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are these guys real superheroes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROLAND>
<LENORE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They think so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LENORE>
<DIRECTION>
The kids scoff... A moment later they head back to the house with their burgers.
</DIRECTION>
<ROLAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But where's Captain Amazing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROLAND>
<EDDIE_JR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He wouldn't be caught dead here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE_JR>
<DIRECTION>
They go into the house. No one says anything. The Shoveler just stares at the burgers on the grill. Vic Damon sings. Furious chugs his beer; he's working himself into a really morose mood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE SPLEEN, munching on a chlorine tablet.
</DIRECTION>
<SPLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, these pool mints are delicious!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPLEEN>
<DIRECTION>
Raja looks at his watch.
</DIRECTION>
<RAJA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe there was traffic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAJA>
<FURIOUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who are we kidding? No one's gonna show. We're living in a fantasy!

<INVISIBLE_BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, guys--we're fighting against evil.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INVISIBLE_BOY>
<FURIOUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good or evil, what's the difference?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FURIOUS>
<SHOVELER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's a big difference.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHOVELER>
<FURIOUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I used to believe that. Now I'm not so sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FURIOUS>
<RAJA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Roy, remember, it is all within your power. The only thing that's in your way... is you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAJA>
<FURIOUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh shut up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FURIOUS>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, there is a knock at the gate. Everyone immediately perks up.
</DIRECTION>
<INVISIBLE_BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INVISIBLE_BOY>
<DIRECTION>
A moment later they open the gate and see... HALF A DOZEN BURLY GUYS wearing various superhero outfits.
</DIRECTION>
<THEIR_LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, man, is this the superhero wingding?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THEIR_LEADER>
<RAJA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is it. Come on in!

</RAJA>
<SUPERHEROES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right! Party!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Etc.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At first glance these guys seem promising... but their outfits are decidedly improvised: weird goggles and sunglasses, shower curtain capes, baseball caps with beer cans on them. Their leader holds a squeegee with a long handle... Furious is suspicious.
</DIRECTION>
<RAJA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAJA>
<THEIR_LEADER>

The Invincible Dudes spot the keg.
</DIRECTION>
<INVINCIBLE_DUDES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa! Brews! Party!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Etc.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They go immediately to the keg and start filling beer cups and guzzling them down. The Raja tries to hand out some forms.
</DIRECTION>
<RAJA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you mind filling out these forms; names, addresses, description of superpowers, that sort of thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAJA>
<INVINCIBLE_DUDES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, dude. No problem.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Etc.) (but they just toss the forms away)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON FURIOUS, watching, starting to get pissed off.
</DIRECTION>
<INVINCIBLE_DUDE_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, man, like where are the babes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INVINCIBLE_DUDE_1>
<INVINCIBLE_DUDE_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It said on the card there'd be babes!

	Actually we lied about the babes, but there's plenty of burgers.

Furious, fed up, confronts Squeegee Man.
</DIRECTION>
<FURIOUS>

	If you're a superhero, what's your power?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FURIOUS>
<SQUEEGEE_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am Squeegee Man.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(holding it out threateningly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Touch my squeegee... and you die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SQUEEGEE_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
The Invincible Dudes are cracking up.
</DIRECTION>
<FURIOUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you fly?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FURIOUS>
<SQUEEGEE_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.

<FURIOUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wanna bet?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FURIOUS>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JUST OUTSIDE THE YARD - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Squeegee Man comes flying--and screaming--over the fence, landing none too gracefully in the front yard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beat and his squeegee come flying out after him. Another beat and the Invincible Dudes come running out the gate in a panic.
</DIRECTION>
<INVINCIBLE_DUDES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's get out of here!... That dude's crazy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INVINCIBLE_DUDES>
<DIRECTION>
They take off down the street, running right past a woman, carrying a bowling ball bag and dressed in a faded, threadbare old rayon superhero costume with a decidedly fifties flavor. She is THE BOWLER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SHOVELER'S BACKYARD - A MOMENT LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Our heroes sit around the patio, dejected, miserable.
</DIRECTION>
<BOWLER>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who died?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOWLER>
<DIRECTION>
They look up, see her standing there, and aren't quite sure what to make of her.
</DIRECTION>
<RAJA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAJA>
<BOWLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm the Bowler.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOWLER>
<SHOVELER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Bowler? I remember him from when I was a kid. He was killed years ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHOVELER>
<BOWLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm his daughter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOWLER>
<DIRECTION>
Our heroes share a look.
</DIRECTION>
<SHOVELER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, honey, being a superhero... it's a guy thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHOVELER>
<BOWLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOWLER>
<DIRECTION>
She takes her bowling ball and spins it on the tip of her finger (like a Harlem Globetrotter). For a long moment she just looks at them, smiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE OTHERS watching, almost mesmerized by the spinning ball...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, she gives an ear splitting battle cry and starts swinging the ball around her in wide ferocious arcs, like a cannibal with a war club--or a twirler on meth, going so fast she almost becomes a blur...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, just as suddenly, she stops, aims and rolls her ball... It shoots straight through Invisible Boy's legs...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON A NEATLY PLACED COLLECTION OF PLASTER LAWN DWARVES -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the ball smashes into then, pulverizing them... It goes into a reverse spin, passes through Invisible Boy's legs again, and returns to the Bowler who is holding its bag open for it... The ball rolls in.
</DIRECTION>
<BOWLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good ball.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOWLER>
<DIRECTION>
ON OUR HEROES, left absolutely speechless.
</DIRECTION>
<BOWLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If it could zip up its own bag, then you'd be impressed, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOWLER>
<DIRECTION>
She turns and walks out. Our heroes share an amazed look, then run after her...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JUST OUTSIDE THE GATE - ON THE BOWLER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
walking away... as Furious catches up with her.

She takes his arm and they all start to walk back into the Shoveler's backyard... but the CAMERA PANS ACROSS THE STREET to the dark place between two houses, where a MAN WEARING A STRANGE STEEL MASK with a frightening, impassively powerful expression stands in the deep shadows, watching them in motionless, predatory silence. We do not know who he is, and we cannot tell if he is good or evil.

The others, touched by this, have gathered around the Bowler, who is holding the old snapshot in her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<BOWLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And then one day, he didn't come home. The police said it was an accident. But cargo containers don't just fall on people. He was murdered... After that I fell apart. I dropped out of school, became a mud wrestler, married and divorced a jerk. When my mother died I hit bottom... but then, when I was cleaning out her attic, I found my father's old bowling bag and costume, almost like he'd left them there for me... and I knew what I had to do.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

INSIDE THE LIMO - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Disco Boys sit in the front. Casanova, Anabel, and Tony P sit in the back, dressed for a night on the town...

	</DIALOGUE>
</TONY_P>
<DIRECTION>
The villains laugh, and Mister Furious EXPLODES INTO RAGE. He swings open his car door, mashing it into the limo and leaving a big dent.
</DIRECTION>

</TONY>
<DIRECTION>
Tony and the boys all reach into their coats for their pistols--but as they yank them out, the Spleen sticks his head out of the station wagon, puts his face right up to the open window of the limo and lets loose with a TREMENDOUS BELCH...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the villains choke and gag in the noxious fumes, Mister Furious goes on a DEMOLITION RAMPAGE, working his way around the limo, punching big dents with his fists, breaking the windows with his head, flattening the tires by kicking them, knocking off the rear view mirror with the back of his hand...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he leaps up on top of the limo...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
While inside the villains gasp for air as big dents are stomped into the roof above them...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE THROUGH THE WINDSHEILD as Furious leaps down onto the hood, and gazes in at them.
</DIRECTION>
<FURIOUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shall I check your oil?

<DIRECTION>
He plunges his hand through the metal of the hood, pulls out the car's dip stick, and checks it.
</DIRECTION>
<FURIOUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looks fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FURIOUS>
<DIRECTION>
He tosses the dip stick away, then leaps off JUST AS Tony P gets off a shot, EXPLODING the windshield of the limo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Furious lands safely on the hood of the station wagon. As the Shoveler throws the Esquire into gear, Furious shouts...
</DIRECTION>
<FURIOUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	NICE CAR!

</FURIOUS>
<DIRECTION>
And our heroes streak off into the night... Casanova and the others stagger out of the demolished limo, sucking in the clean air.

Furious struggles to break free and join the fight, but the chains are too strong... and the stranger doesn't need any help.

Tony P flicks open a big switchblade and lunges at the stranger, who sidesteps him like a matador and swings his machete at him. Tony P turns, about to charge again.

<DIRECTION>
(picks up a purple and orange sprayer that looks like a suped up water gun)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I call it the Shrinker! I developed it after years of studying the worst dry cleaners I could find. It instantly shrinks fabrics to half their size. Anyone caught in its spray is immediately immobilized by their own clothing!

</BOWLER>
<DIRECTION>
She tosses the can to him. He catches it--just as a small angry tornado FUNNELS out of the can. It catches Furious and lifts him high in the air... then dissipates to nothing...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beat later Furious lands on the ground with a painful thump.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE OTHERS, amazed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Furious gets to his feet, unhurt, but really pissed off. He starts back toward the barn, violently kicking the empty can. The others get out of his way, as, muttering angrily to himself, he goes back into the barn...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And emerges a moment later, toting the air cannon.
</DIRECTION>
<HELLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's got the air cannon!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELLER>
<DIRECTION>
The others think he's going to use it on them and scatter for cover. but Furious steps out into the yard, looking for a suitable target... He sees an old abandoned outhouse, puts the air cannon to his shoulder, aims, and fires...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a loud WHOOOOMPH of compressed air, and the huge recoil of the cannon instantly flings Furious back against the wall of the barn. But the big rush of air hits the shed dead center... and BLOWS IT TO PIECES, leaving only the old seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Furious gets up, dusts himself off, and moves to Doc Heller.

CLOSE ON DOC HELLER aiming his air cannon... CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL our heroes (minus Furious) standing in a pack right behind him, holding him down. HE fires, and the recoil jolts them all violently, but it doesn't knock them over...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as half a dozen scarecrows are blown to pieces... Our heroes chieer and shake their fists... while Mr. Furious sits alone on the sidelines, drinking bourbon, and feeling very alienated.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VARIOUS SHOTS as our heroes learn to fight as a team... crawling across the grass together....charginq in a line... hurling canned tornadoes... while Furious sits it out, brooding, drinking, and getting very jealous of the Sphinx.
</DIRECTION>

Shoveler, Bowler, and the Sphinx stand shoulder to shoulder, as Invisible Boy, Spleen, Raja, and the Doc throw small stones at them... They deflect the pebbles with shovel, bowling ball, and machete... Theyre having fun. They're becoming a team...

barely able to breath, Little Furious flops back onto the seat, his face a mask of heat and terror... But suddenly, a change begins to take place in him, as some primordial defense mechanism kicks in... and his fear begins to give way to rage... His teeth bare.

As the small convoy drives past, Invisible Boy slips out from behind some trees, runs after the truck, jumps up and sits on its rear bumper. The Spleen comes running after him, and Invisible Boy reaches out, grabs his hand and pulls him up alongside him. Invisible Boy tries the rear gate. It's open.

	They always call the great ones nuts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASANOVA>
<FURIOUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the nuts always call themselves great.

</FURIOUS>
<CASANOVA>
<DIRECTION>
(his psychosis showing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you with me... or against me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASANOVA>
<FURIOUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Against.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FURIOUS>
<CASANOVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too bad. PLUG HIM!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASANOVA>
<DIRECTION>
Gunfire rings out from the alley as the Disco Bays step out, their pistols blazing. But Furious has anticipated them. He leaps right at Casanova, pins his arms in a bear hug and holds him in the line of fire.
</DIRECTION>
<CASANOVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	WAIT!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASANOVA>
<DIRECTION>
The Disco BQys stop firing... Furious drags Casanova back into an empty lot, using him as a shield.
</DIRECTION>
<FURIOUS>
<DIRECTION>
(to Casanova)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks for reminding me which team I'm on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FURIOUS>

	You're dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASANOVA>
<FURIOUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So are you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FURIOUS>
<DIRECTION>
Furious releases Casanova, then runs for it and leaps over the wooden wall at the end of the lot... as the Disco Boys open fire again, and their bullets punch holes through the wall...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Furious runs down a back street and escapes into the night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE FRANKENSTEIN CENTER - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The convoy drives up the hill toward an ominous looking structure (that we recognize from the model on the TV interview with Casanova earlier.) A high central tower rises up out of the half completed bulwarks of featureless concrete. It looks both totally modern and completely ancient, but a profound sense of evil connects both themes beautifully.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON a plaque that reads... "Frankenstein Center for the Performing and Non-performing Arts".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The gates of the center open, and the convoy passes through.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE TRUCK - A NONENT LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Invisible Boy and the Spleen stand listening, waiting, as they feel the truck pull to a stop...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A moment later the gate is pulled opened... Anabel is there with several thuggy looking SECURITY GUARDS.
</DIRECTION>
<ANABEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be careful with my baby.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANABEL>
<DIRECTION>
There are two lumps under the packing blankets again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LOADING DOCK - A FEW MINUTES LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crate is being carried away by a forklift... A beat, and then Invisible Boy and the Spleen slip out of the empty truck...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And run down the road back toward the gates... which are still open. They're just about to pass safely through them, when a PAIR OF ARMED SECURITY GUARDS, step in their path, their guns pointed at thern.
</DIRECTION>
<GUARD_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Freeze!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD_1>
<GUARD_2>
	<DIALOGUE>

They freeze, their hands held high.

<GUARD_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you two doing here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD_2>
<DIRECTION>
Our heroes are mute.
</DIRECTION>
<GUARD_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not talking, eh? That can be fixed. Turn around, start walking up the hill--
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD_1>
<GUARD_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And no funny business.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD_2>
<DIRECTION>
Invisible Boy and the Spleen turn, hands in the air, and start up the hill, the guards right behind them.
</DIRECTION>
<SPLEEN>
<DIRECTION>
(after a moment, to Invisible Boy, in a whisper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pinch 'em.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPLEEN>
<DIRECTION>
Invisible Boy pinches his nostrils--and the Spleen lets out with a horrendous fart. The guards gag and choke violently in the fumes as our heroes turn and run for it... escaping out the gates.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DOC KELLER'S LABORATORY/BARN - A LITTLE LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Invisible Boy and Spleen report to the others.
</DIRECTION>
<INVISIBLE_BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever was in that crate... is from Russia.

The others consider this, then hear a familiar voice.

<FURIOUS>
<DIRECTION>
(0.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is there room in the pack for one more wolf?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FURIOUS>
<DIRECTION>
They look up and see that Furious has just returned... The Sphinx moves to him. For a moment they stand face to face...
</DIRECTION>
<FURIOUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was wrong... I need my friends.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FURIOUS>
<DIRECTION>
Sphinx takes off his mask, revealing that he is the busboy from the Tacky Taco.
</DIRECTION>
<SPHINX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Amigo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPHINX>
<DIRECTION>
They embrace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A few mimutes later. The others are gathered around Furious, listening to his story.
</DIRECTION>
<FURIOUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Casanova said that in two days the entire city would belong to him... and there wasn't a thing that we could do about it.

</FURIOUS>
<DIRECTION>
Through the window the moon is seen rising over the hillside, the Frankenstein Center silhouetted ominously against it. Raja, Shoveler, and Furious gaze at it.
</DIRECTION>
<SHOVELER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe it's time we checked that place out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHOVELER>
<RAJA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But how do we get in?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAJA>
<FURIOUS>

</FURIOUS>
<DIRECTION>
MONTAGE WITH MUSIC - THE NEXT DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLASSIC DISCO ("Stayin' Alive" if we can get the rights)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Furious, Raja, and Shoveler (in street clothes) walk down the street together and step into the doorway of... the Salvation Army Thrift Shop...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Later. CLOSE ON three pairs of legs, wearing polyester pants and vintage shoes (ala the classic shot from "Saturday Night Fever")... CAMERA WIDENS TO REVEAL our three heroes, dressed in full blown seventies attire (with vintage sunglasses), doing their best Travolta strut down the street...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MUSIC CONTINUES as our heroes strut their way through the gates of the art center, right past the security guards...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUTSIDE THE CENTER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They climb the long stairs toward the center, which looms above them... then pass through the big wooden doors and into...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MAIN HALL - A MOMENT LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
END MUSIC as our heroes move through a vast, but empty main hall... A small army of heavily armed security guards marches about.
</DIRECTION>
<RAJA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So where's the art?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAJA>
<FURIOUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He hasn't stolen it yet.

</FURIOUS>
<SHOVELER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This place is built like a fortress.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHOVELER>
<FURIOUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because thats what it is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FURIOUS>
<DIRECTION>
They hear a WILD BURST OF DRUNKEN LAUGHTER echoing through the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<RAJA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAJA>
<FURIOUS>
<DIRECTION>
(following the sound)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FURIOUS>
<DIRECTION>
They approach a doorway. The noise is coming from within.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BANQUET IIALL - A MOMENT LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as our heroes step inside and see... A big luncheon is in progress. Casanova, Anabel, and Tony P sit at the head table. The room is lined with banquet tables, which are filled with VICIOUS LOOKING CHARACTERS, drunk, eating, laughing, and giving the waitresses a very rough tim..

</RAJA>
<DIRECTION>
A more degenerate group of criminals never sat down to lunch. Furious recognizes one of the waitresses... It's Monica.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Casanova's got his eye on her, too, and he remembers her from the night before on the street with Furious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON ANABEL, noticing his interest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Our heroes see Monica walking straight toward them. They turn away, lean against a wail, trying to be totally inconspicuous...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But as she passes them, not noticing them... Casanova approaches her.
</DIRECTION>
<CASANOVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASANOVA>
<DIRECTION>
She stops, turns to him, while our heroes listen in, only a few feet away...
</DIRECTION>
<CASANOVA>
<DIRECTION>
(reading her name tag)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Monica... Beautiful name. It suits you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASANOVA>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON FURIOUS, getting jealous.
</DIRECTION>
<CASANOVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope you won't take this the wrong way, but I couldn't help but notice... that you're a dead ringer for Veronica Lake in "The Blue Dahlia".

<MONICA>

	Really?

Furious growls. Raja gives him an elbow.

She turns and walks into the kitchen.

CLOSE ON CASANOVA, watching her; his intentions are sinister... He turns and sees... our heroes, hanging by the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<CASANOVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you three doing here? This is invited guests only. Out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASANOVA>
<DIRECTION>
Our heroes skulk out.

<DIRECTION>
JUST OUTSIDE THE BANQUET HALL - CONTINUOUS

</DIRECTION>
<RAJA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was too close.

<SHOVELER>
	<DIALOGUE>

</SHOVELER>
<FURIOUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FURIOUS>
<DIRECTION>
Furious has spotted... a large covered dessert table, waiting to be wheeled into the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK IN THE BANQUET HALL - A FEW MINUTES LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the dessert table is wheeled in... and in a CLOSER ANGLE, under the table cloth, we see three pairs of disco shoes creeping along...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A few minutes later, Monica steps up to the dessert table... Suddenly, she is yanked under.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNDER THE TABLE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Monica struggles, tries to cry out, but a hand is clamped firmly over her mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<FURIOUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FURIOUS>
<DIRECTION>
She calms down, and he takes his hand off her mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<MONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you guys doing here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	RAJA & SHOVELER Shhhh!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The waitresses leave; the big doors to the dining room are swung closed, and the cigars are lit. The meeting has begun. Casanova takes the podium.
</DIRECTION>
<CASANOVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you all for coming. I hope you enjoy the cigars. I had to kill a dozen Cubans to get them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASANOVA>
<DIRECTION>
Tony P chuckles loudly, but the joke goes over like a lead balloon with the rest of the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<CASANOVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twenty years ago, this town was yours! AND I WAS YOUR KING!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASANOVA>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE HOODS, listening, bored, puffing on their cigars; this is a sad old story.
</DIRECTION>
<CASANOVA>
<DIRECTION>
(tragically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But they called me a psycho, and they put me away. For twenty years I rotted in my cell, painting watercolors, writing haikus--just waiting for the day I could take my revenge. Well, brothers, that day has come!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASANOVA>
<DIRECTION>
ON OUR HEROES under the table, listening. Monica begins to realize what's going on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO CASANOVA -
</DIRECTION>
<CASANOVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They thought I was crazy? Well the joke's on them--because tonight at precisely midnight--on the twentieth anniversary of my tragic arrest-- every man, woman, and child in this city is going to turn into a RAVING PSYCSOTIC! Mothers will murder their tots! Old ladies will strangle their cats! Children will bump off their babysitters!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASANOVA>
<DIRECTION>
The guests think Casanova's completely lost it. Italian Ice speaks up.
</DIRECTION>
<ITALIAN_ICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're outta your mind!

</ITALIAN_ICE>
<CASANOVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I beg your pardon?

<ITALIAN_ICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nobody could drive a whole city crazy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ITALIAN_ICE>
<CASANOVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell you what, Ice. I'll mke you a friendly little wager. It I can't do it... you can blow my brains out. If I can, I'll blow out yours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASANOVA>
<DIRECTION>
Now the hoods' interest has been perked.
</DIRECTION>
<ITALIAN_ICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Done.

<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honey, give the boys a taste.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASANOVA>
<DIRECTION>
Anabel puts on a pair of heavy duty sound deadening ear protectors, then presses a button on a small remote control device.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON A SPEAKER, placed above the podium... as the air is suddenly filled with a weird, stridulating, HORRIFIC NOISE (somewhere between the sound of a fire siren and a hornet trapped in your ear) and everyone in the room (except Anabel) goes COMPLETELY BERSERK...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PANS the tables as the guests laugh dementedly, punching, gouging, strangling, and stabbing each other...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Under the serving table our heroes go crazy...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Casanova, in a state of psychotic ecstasy, whips out his pistol and empties it into Italian Ice... who drops to the floor, dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anabel presses the button again; the sound winds down and stops, and everything returns to normal. The entire event lasted only a few seconds, but the guests are dazzled.
</DIRECTION>
<CROOKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was great!... What the hell was that?... How did you do that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROOKS>
<DIRECTION>
Casanova throws Anabel a kiss.
</DIRECTION>
<CASANOVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tonight, at midnight, that sound will be amplified across this entire city. Murder and mayhem will reign supreme! And Champion City will be ours again! This will be our castle! And I will be our king! And there's no one to stop us!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASANOVA>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, a familiar voice is heard.
</DIRECTION>
<AMAZING>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not so fast, Casanova!
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMAZING>
<DIRECTION>
A pair of curtains suddenly part... and Captain Amazing (looking a bit singed) is standing there in classic superhero pose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PANS the crooks, as their criminal ecstasy turns instantly to terror. They yank out their pistols, dive for cover under the table, throw up their hands in surrender, etc... But Casanova just grins.
</DIRECTION>
<CASANOVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry, fellas...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(moves to Captain Amazing, and puts his arm chummily around him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I killed him... and I've had him stuffed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASANOVA>
<DIRECTION>
Casaova reaches behind Captain Amazing's back and pulls a string (like the ones they used to have on those old talking dolls).
</DIRECTION>
<AMAZING>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Long live the King!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELVIS_BROTHER_2>
<DIRECTION>
The crooks fire their pistols exuberantly into the air, as disco music fills the air and Casanova dances, basking in their adoration...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And our heroes slip out from under the table and make good their escape...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DOC HELLER'S BARN/LAB - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Our heroes and Monica pow-wow, sobered by what they have seen.

<HELLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ten years ago the Kremlin's top secret Psychiatric Warfare Division developed a prototype for a weapon that emitted a fluctuating alternative frequency noise that produced a violent psychotic reaction in any mammal within hearing distance. But when the old Soviet Union fell the stridulator and its brilliant inventor, Doctor Kopov, disappeared.

<SHOVELER>
	<DIALOGUE>

</FURIOUS>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE SPLEEN...
</DIRECTION>
<FURIOUS>

	And smell a little funny. We're not bulletproof and we can't fly. But we're superheroes--and that means doing what's right- -even when it's impossible... This is our city- -these are our friends, our famlies--and if we don't save them, nobody will! So I say we take a ride up that hill, blast our way in there, destroy that Psycho-whatchamabob-- and teach those deviants a lesson they'll never forget!

BACK IN THE MAIN HALL - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>

as our heroes come charging out of the Herkimer, using their various skills to blow through the surprised guards. Mr. Furious comes out last, not quite sure what to do with himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But suddenly, a withering barrage of machine gun fire is being laid down on them by three guards firing tommy guns from a balcony overlooking the floor. Bullets splatter all around them--and several unlucky guards are hit--but our heroes dive for cover. The Raja tries to get off a fork, but the firing is too intense. Our heroes are pinned down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON MR. FURIOUS as he sees... the bag of canned tornadoes. He's got no superpowers, and he's scared to death, but he grabs a canned tornado.

<DIRECTION>
Bullets dancing all around him, Furious runs a desperate (but impressive) zig-zag pattern across the floor... He performs a wild somersault, comes up on his feet, pops open the can, and executes a perfect jump shot, lobbing it right into the balcony. The tornado funnels out, and the guards are sent flying.

A hapless guard retreats under the arch--the Eye instantly focuses on him, and he is hit by a dozen nasty looking laser beams... that SIZZLE HIM...

A moment later our heroes arrive at the arch. Furious is about to run through, but Doc Heller holds him back.

FLASH TO the terrified little boy trapped in the back of his p8arents' car, crying, pounding on the windows...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then... Mr. Furious' hands clench into fists--his hair stands up-- and his face turns into a mask of primordial rage. His button has finally been pressed. Be's MAD! He reaches up as high as he can...

CLOSE ON HIS HAND -

<DIRECTION>
as his fingers literally dig into the concrete of the wall... and he pulls himself up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Casanova throws Monica onto the bed, puts his hands on her throat and strangles her as she thrashes helplessly against his immense strength.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO FURIOUS -

Fifty feet up and climbing. He pulls himself up, one hand, then another, digging in his fingernails, catchng his toes on whatever tiny cracks he can find... as the others gaze up at him.

</INVISIBLE_BOY>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a deep breath, closes his eyes, and concentrates...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON FURIOUS as the fingers of one hand lose their grip and a toehold gives way... For a desperate moment, Furious is dangling off the wall by the tips of the fingers of one hand. Only his incredible rage keeps his fingertips taut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, there is a flash of silver, and a large cake fork embeds in the concrete not far from his head. Furious grabs hold of it, and throws a grateful look down to the Raja...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Who salaams up at him...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Invisible Boy, eyes closed in concentration, walks very slowly, hands at his sides, in an almost Egyptian pose... toward the eye... which stares down mercilessly, waiting for its next victim...

we notice that Invisible Boy has become... just slightly transparent.

	Pootchkie, you're over-reacting. This is our night. It's what we've lied for... cheated for... murdered for. She's just a plaything, a trifle... You're the only woman who's ever meant anything to me. I adore you. I worship you. I want to make you my bride.

While, downstairs, the Shoveler dispatches the Elvis Brothers with some nifty shovel work... But suddenly, the Bland Boys, pistols blazing, are advancing on him, forcing him back against the base of a sculpture. But the Raja suddenly leaps up onto the sculpture.

Casanova and Furious collide in the center of the room and grapple in a contest of psychotically enhanced superhuman strength... Casanova gets his hands around Furious's throat and crushes it...

Furious grabs Casanova's wrists... and crushes them. Casanova howls with pain, loses his grip. Furious slugs him, again and again... then he grabs Casanova by the belt, swings him around, and HURLS him into the air...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Casanova CRASHES into the huge crystal chandelier--there is an explosion of crystal and glass. Furious averts his eyes as cut glass rains down all around him... then he looks up and sees...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Casanova's gold chain has hooked onto a fixture of the chandelier. Casanova kicks and flails... as he is hanged by the neck on his own gold chain...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Furious moves to the wolf sculpture. Be PLUNGES HIS HAND through its bronze casing, and RIPS OUT the heart of the Psychostridulator, a flashing football sized device that gives off an unamplifjed, but higher pitched and more irritating sound...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Furious HURLS the device hard against the floor, and it smashes into a thousand pieces...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON ONE OF THE PIECES -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In insect sized device that gives off an even higher pitched, even more disorienting sound. This is the very nerve center of the Psychostridulator...

<DIRECTION>
Furious lifts his foot and crushes it hard under his heel...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SILENCE...

Furious drops to his knees, wounded, exhausted... He looks up... at Casanova, who dangles lifelessly off the chandelier...
