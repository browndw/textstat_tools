EXT. QUADRANGLE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LONG SHOT The quadrangle of Army buildings is quiet and deserted. A broken-down taxi drives in at one corner and slowly makes its way around the quadrangle. SUPERIMPOSED over shot is the LEGEND:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HAWAII, 1941. SIX MONTHS BEFORE PEARL HARBOR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The taxi pulls up across the street from camera. A soldier gets out, pulls two heavily loaded barracks bags after him. He pays the driver, hoists the bags to his back, moves toward camera. The taxi drives away slowly. The soldier walks toward steps leading to a low building. He is PREWITT (called "PREW" for short), 22 years old, well-built, good-looking. He wears an enlisted man's uniform and on the sleeves are marks where chevrons have been removed. He pauses, looks up over the door. CAMERA PANS UP to sign which reads: ORDERLY ROOM - G COMPANY, 219TH REGIMENT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM SHOT A small thin soldier in an undershirt and fatigue pants backs out of the screen door and into shot. He is wielding a frayed broom. This is PRIVATE ANGELO MAGGIO. He is violent and funny and sour and friendly. He sees Prewitt's legs but not his face, speaks as he sweeps a cloud of dust off the porch.

Maggio notices the marks on the sleeves where the stripes have been removed. Prew follows his glance.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGGIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You quit the Bugle Corps...?
	</DIALOGUE>

</PHEW>
<DIRECTION>
TRUCKING SHOT ALONG COMPANY STREET Prew walks slowly down the raised porch alongside the street. He takes the mouthpiece of a bugle from his pocket, jiggles it idly, a habit of his. He comes to the Dayroom, glances through the screen door, goes in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DAYROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM SHOT The Dayroom has a pool table, ping-pong table, a radio, etc. Moth-eaten, upholstered chairs line both walls. The place is empty as Prew enters. He looks around casually, sees the pool table in an alcove. He moves over to it, puts the bugle mouthpiece in his pocket, picks a cue from the rack on the wall. He switches on the light, chalks the cue.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT The triangle of balls is already racked on the table. Prew addresses the cue ball, shoots and breaks the rack solidly. He watches the balls hurry around the table.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	What're you think you're doing!? Why ain't you out in the field with the Compny? What's your name?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WARDEN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The voice is brawling, brash, vigorous. Prew turns slowly. CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS to INCLUDE FIRST SERGEANT MILTON WARDEN, almost at Prew's elbow. He is thirty-four, big and powerful, has a neatly-trimmed moustache.
</DIRECTION>
<PREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Prewitt. Transfer from Shafter.

</PREW>
<WARDEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. I heard about you.

</WARDEN>
<PREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I heard about you, too, Warden.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PREW>
<WARDEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, put up that cue and come along. This here's a rifle outfit, Prewitt. You ain't suppose to enjoy yourself before sundown. The Man's very particlar about little things like that.

Warden goes out of the Dayroom. Prew puts up the cue and follows him.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ORDERLY ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM SHOT as Prew and Warden enter. Maggio is sweeping the room. MAZZIOLI, a bespectacled, intellectual-looking Private First Class, is at the clerk's desk, opening it, taking out papers, etc. Prew sits on a bench as Warden goes over to Mazzioli.
</DIRECTION>
<WARDEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mazzioli! Grant went to the hospital yesterday. Did you make up his sick record? Did you make a note for the morning report?! You're the Compny Clerk. The lousy Sickbook is your job!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WARDEN>
<MAZZIOLI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those medics didn't get the Sickbook back till late yesterday -- I'll tend to it right now --

</MAZZIOLI>
<WARDEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks. I already done it for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WARDEN>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE Maggio has swept his way over to Prew. He stops sweeping now, stares at the other man as if still incredulous.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGGIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you the beat bugler they got over at Shatter. You probly the best on this whole Rock.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIO>
<DIRECTION>
In b.g., Warden has turned from Mazzioli and is looking at Prew. Prew looks back coolly, answers Maggio thoughtfully.
</DIRECTION>
<PREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's true.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PREW>
<DIRECTION>
Maggio wags his head, bends over to pick up wastepaper basket.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGGIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, friend, I feel for you. But from my position I can't quite reach you.

</MAGGIO>
<WARDEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ten-sh-HUT!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WARDEN>
<DIRECTION>
Prewitt, Mazzioli and Maggio spring to attention. The screen door bangs and CAPTAIN DANA HOLMES enters shot. He wears cavalry boots and spurs. He is about forty, unsure of himself, therefore always too certain with his men. He nods pleasantly.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At ease. Good morning, men. Anything special this morning, Sergeant Warden? I've only a few minutes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<WARDEN>
	<DIALOGUE>

Holmes goes into his office. Warden jerks his thumb toward the door. Prewitt goes into the office. Warden follows him.

INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes is seated at his desk as Prewitt and Warden enter. A placard on it reads: CAPTAIN HOLMES. A smaller desk nearby has a placard' reading: 1ST SERGEANT WARDEN. Warden seats himself at this desk. On the walls are framed photographs of prizefighters as well as one of a large golden trophy. On Holmes' desk is a small framed photograph of a very attractive blonde woman. Prewitt comes to attention in front of Holmes' desk.

<DIRECTION>
ANGLE FEATURING WARDEN Holmes cannot see Warden who is grinning at Prewitt with unholy glee.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Plenty of room for advancement for a man who knows how to soldier. But he's got to show me he's got it on the ball. I don't know what you've been used to in the Bugle Corps, but in my outfit we run it by the book. What kind of trouble were you in over there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<PREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No trouble, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PREW>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What made you transfer out, then?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<PREW>

</PREW>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>

</HOLMES>

He studies Prew for a moment, sees Warden on the edge of his chair, watching hawk-like.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something you wanted to ask, Sergeant?

</HOLMES>
<WARDEN>
<DIRECTION>
(EXPLODES SUDDENLY)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who? Me? Whv, yes, air. You had Corpral's stripes in the Bugle Corps, Prewitt. You took a bust to buck Private to transfer to an Infantry Compny. Why? Because you like to hike?
	</DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right. I was First Bugler at Shafter for two years. The topkick had a friend who transferred in from the states. Next day he made him First Bugler over me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PREW>
<WARDEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you asked out on account of that!?

Warden swings his chair around, absorbs himself in work at his desk as if the Prew situation is too absurd to concern himself with. Holmes speaks blandly, winningly.
</DIRECTION>

MEDIUM SHOT During this shot Maggio can be seen in b.g. through door to Orderly Room. He pretends to be sweeping, but stops now and then to listen.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, it's too bad about that. I can understand how you feel. But those things happen in this game. A man has got to accept that possibility when he fights.

	No, sir. I dint say --

</PREW>
<HOLMES>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want it disbanded, sir.

<DIRECTION>
(DOGGEDLY)

	<DIALOGUE>
	But I don't see why any man should fight unless he wants to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PREW>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It looks to me like you're trying to acquire a reputation as a lone wolf, Prewitt. You should know that in the Army it's not the individual that counts. If a man wants to get ahead he has certain responsibilities to fulfill that go beyond the regulations. It might look as though I were a free agent, but I'm not. Nobody is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes waits hopefully for a moment, then realizes Prew is not going to respond further. He stands. Prew snaps to attention.

MEDIUM SHOT 22 Karen, in a negligee, is seated at a dressing table, brushing her hair -- steadily, gracefully, enjoying the sensual pleasure of it. Karen is a woman of moods and tempers, spontaneous, quick to impulse. A car is heard pulling up in the driveway, the motor stopping. Karen's brush strokes become faster, rougher. The front door is heard opening and Holmes' voice calling, "Karen." She does not answer. Holmes enters. He seems to have had a few drinks. Through the following, Karen continues brushing her hair.

INT. KITCHEN HOLMES HOUSE - DAY

MEDIUM SHOT The kitchen is small and undistinguished. Karen takes a whisky bottle from a cabinet, pours a straight, stiff drink, puts it on the sink. Warden puts the papers down and drinks. Karen sits on a high kitchen stool.

	Yes. But not important they get signed today. Tomorrow's okay.

Karen suddenly, deliberately, rips the papers in half. Then she tears them into bits and throws them into the wastebasket. Warden appreciates the gesture, relaxes for the first time. He grins widely.
</DIRECTION>
<WARDEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got carbons of those back at the office. So it won't be much work to fix them up.

</WARDEN>
<DIRECTION>
Warden's control has begun to affect Karen's now. She is losing her poise.

	That's what I like about you, Sergeant. You have confidence. It's also what I dislike about you.

	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not confidence. It's honesty.

</WARDEN>
<DIRECTION>
He moves close to Karen, is on the verge of embracing her. Greatly tempted but greatly disturbed, she turns away. During next she pours herself a drink, the bottle shaking in her hand. Her tone is no longer brittle. It is bitter.
</DIRECTION>
<KAREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Waste, did you say? Now that's a subject I might tell you something about. There's we. And then there's waste. Positive and negative. The negative is sometimes more interesting... more evil. For example -- what about the house without a child? Tell me your thoughts, Sergeant.

They stare squarely at each other, both puzzled and a little afraid of their emotions. This is something neither had counted on.
</DIRECTION>
<WARDEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know a beach near Diamond Head. Nobody ever goes there. The cars on the highway pass above and they never know it's there. You feel like you used to feel when you were a kid, hiding by yourself in a cave, watching the others hunting you.

Karen leans back against the sink, watches him go out to the pantry. A moment later the sound of the door is heard as he leaves the house. She turns on the faucet, starts to rinse, the glasses they have used. Suddenly she turns the faucet on full force, watches it pound into the sink.

EFFECT MONTAGE The MONTAGE consists of a continuous stream of SUPERIMPOSURES depicting Prew's growing humiliation and exhaustion at the hands of the non-corns. Mingling with the background shots are VARIOUS ANGLES of CLOSEUPS of Prew. As the speed of the sequence increases, the stubborn smile on his face gives way to hurt, bitterness, anger... Over shots we occasionally hear stray shouts of the non-corns as they belabor Prew, but for the most part these and other dialogue are obliterated by MUSIC. The MONTAGE can be selected and created from the FOLLOWING:

MEDIUM SHOT PREW bent over the sink, scraping, washing and rinsing cooking pans and mixing basins. He hangs the soap bucket on the hot faucet and turns it on full force. As he does, PRIVATE WILLARD, a fat, whining cook, dumps an additional huge pile of pans before him. Prew looks at them ruefully. Willard says something to him with a "hustle up" gesture. The faucet drowns the words.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM SHOT ANOTHER PART OF KITCHEN PREW AT SINK IN B.G. Men are working in the steady, helpless motion of the KP. Waiters swing in and out of the entrances leading to the mess halls, carrying large trays.

MEDIUM SHOT PRIVATE TREADWELL A slow, lazy, heavy man, peeling potatoes. There is a large kettle filled with dirty water in front of him in which the potatoes are floating. Treadwell stabs at one with a long fork, misses it. He stabs again, almost in slow motion, misses again. He sees Stark glowering over him.

CAMERA PANS as Mrs. Kipfer moves to and fro encouraging the men to enjoy themselves. The New Congress is a sort of primitive U.S.O., a place of well-worn merriment. It is not a house of prostitution but the girls look available for goosing... all but one we see at the end of the PAN. She sits alone on a couch. This is LORENE.

MEDIUM SHOT PARK BENCH Karen sits on the bench, her ankles crosses primly, very ill at ease. There is Payday activity here also; amorous strolling couples; men in ones and twos looking for pickups. Several unattached men pass Karen, ogle her. She is about to get up and leave when Warden comes into shot, stands over her. His civilian suit is neat and well-cut. Both are strained, awkward, antagonistic. Now that the step has been taken they are not at all sure it was a clever one.

MEDIUM SHOT ON BEACH A tiny beach set among rocks. The pale sand glows in the moonlight. Warden, in a bathing suit, is lighting a fire about ten yards from the water's edge. Karen is just stepping out of her dress; her bathing suit is underneath. A couple of GI blankets near the fire. Her teeth are beginning to chatter in the chill of the night air; she raises her arms to the sky longingly, happily.

MEDIUM SHOT DIVAN CAMERA ANGLED so we see only back of the divan. We hear soft chuckles from Prew and Lorene o.s., then silence for several moments. CAMERA MOVES as we hear a few more low, intimate laughs, then Prew and Lorene are disclosed on the couch, their heads close together as if they have just kissed pleasantly but not passionately. Mrs. Kipfer's living room is on the order of the vestibule; it, too, has a faded lavender feeling. A door leading to another room is half open in b.g. A door leading to a hall is closed. Prew's arm is around Lorene's shoulder; he is very relaxed, regards her with something like wonder. Lorene is mellower, too, making no effort now to be "the Princess." She speaks as if resuming a conversation.

	Over at Port Shafter... I used to fight... Middleweight. I was pretty good. I used to work out with Dixie Wells. He was a light-heavy, but he was fast... And good. He loved boxing. He was gonna come out of the Army and go right into the upper brackets... People on the Outside had their eye on him.

	I'd been married to Captain Dana E. Holmes two years. Only he was a First Lieutenant then. Back at Fort Bliss. We lived right on a little lake where we could fish and swim and be alone, our 'dream cottage'... I'm sure you must be able to picture it. It was off on a back road, four miles from the highway. Two miles from a neighbor and a telephone....

	Then, by that time, you're pregnant. And at least you've something else to hope for. I think I was almost happy that night the pains began. Even though they were weeks too early, a whole month too early. I remember Dana was putting on that dapper silk gabardine uniform he used to wear. He was going to an officer's 'seminar.' He was kidding me about false labor. I didn't think it was humorous. I told him to get home early, to bring the doctor with him. He smiled tenderly and told me about the psychic reactions of women to pregnancy. But never fear, he'd be back early. And maybe he would have... if the 'seminar' hadn't been with the hat-check girl in one of the night clubs.

	He was only a little drunk when he came in... at five a.m. He looked alarmed when he saw me. I guess it was because of my screams. I was lying there on the floor, you see -- No, don't say anything. I'm not finished yet. Of course, the baby was dead. It was a boy. But they worked over me at the hospital and fixed me up fine. They even took my appendix out, too. They threw that in free. It was all fine.

PAN SHOT AROUND ROOM Over shot soft strumming guitars and two voices singing a quiet blues. There are scattered groups,about fifteen men in all -- playing pool, ping-pong, reading, writing letters, talking. CAMERA REACHES PRIVATE SAL ANDERSON and Friday Clark, playing the guitars and singing. Clark plays only passably, but Anderson is highly accomplished, effortlessly sounding off chord progressions in diminished minors. Friday, the bugler, is about twenty-four, with shy, trusting eyes. Anderson is the same age, also quiet, non-aggressive. CAMERA CONTINUES PANNING, PASSES a soldier reading a newspaper who shakes his head and mutters, "... ain't it terrible about Lou Gehrig dyin...", then MOVES IN to HOLD on a group at a window seat, bulling. Prew is stretched out wearily, looks as if he's been through another recent dose of The Treatment. Maggio perches in the frame of the window like an aggressive robin.

INT. CHOY'S - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT OLD CHOY An aged Chinese, at least seventy-five, OLD CHOY has a long white beard and wears a black skull cap and an embroidered robe. He is motionless, surveying the pandemonium which we hear over shot: the sounds of men laughing, talking and shouting blend with jukebox music blasting Chattanooga, Choo Choo. YOUNG CHOP, Old Choy's son, passes; he is thirty, white- aproned, bustling, Americanized. CAMERA PANS WITH him, DISCLOSING the small beer-house; it has unpainted cement walls and a cement floor; the only thing that might be called decorative is the jukebox. The place is crowded with men from Schofield, a raucous assemblage; everyone is drinking beer and the smoke hangs in thick layers. At a table near the door sit Prew, Maggio, Clark, Anderson, Treadwell and Mazzioli. At a corner table behind a forest of beer bottles and cans are Warden, Stark, Karelsen and Chief Choate.

	The Canal Zone for me. This girl down there. She was a planter's daughter, see. She lived a very sheltered life. A very moral young lady, Milt. I took her out to a high class dinner and then dancing. It was a great shock to her to learn about life. But she took it well. She got to like me very much after that.

<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM SHOT PREW'S TABLE Maggio, Anderson and Treadwell are comparing snapshots from home, spreading them out on the table. Mazzioli is talking to Prew with great earnestness.
</DIRECTION>
<MAZZIOLI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... it's in regulations. You've got a right to complain. You've got a right to take your case to the Inspector General. Any soldier has, even a plain dogface.

(SAVAGELY)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When you gonna learn to play a bugle!?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PREW>
<DIRECTION>
In overwhelming, uncontrollable protest, Prew slaps the bugle away from Clark's mouth. In one motion he wipes the mouthpiece on his sleeve, raises it to his lips and blows his own wild, violent obligato to the jukebox music.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FULL SHOT CHOY'S as Prew plays on, the bugle's pure tone pealing through the room. Everyone puts down his beer, stops talking and turns toward Prew.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT WARDEN reacting. He frowns, moved by the cry behind the music.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT PREW'S TABLE FEATURING MAGGIO as he watches and listens, an exultation for his friend nakedly revealed on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE PREW'S TABLE FEATURING PREW Hitting an almost impossibly high note, he stops as suddenly as he has begun. He has played perhaps fifteen seconds in
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
all. He puts the bugle down on the table, embarrassed now, the violence gone, some of the wrath unloaded.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM SHOT AT DOOR The room is quiet for several moments, except for the continuing jukebox music, which sounds pale and thin now. Fatso Judson strolls in, stands at the door. Some of the men see him, but no one greets him. Fatso threads his way between tables as the room slowly begins to return to normal and the men turn back to their beer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM SHOT PREW'S TABLE as Fatso passes. He stops, leans over Anderson's shoulder to look at the snapshots on the table. He points to one picture, a pretty young girl of about fifteen, posing Hollywoodishly in a bathing suit, cracks his knuckles loudly.
</DIRECTION>
<FATSO>

<FATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoever! Say, she's a real good piece of whistle bait! I'd sure like to get my mitts around her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATSO>
<DIRECTION>
He laughs complacently at his own wit, tosses the picture on the table, starts to move on, Maggio rises, picks up the heavy wooden stool he's been sitting on and smashes it down on Fatso's head with all his strength,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE as again the laughing and shouting in the room stops abruptly. Fatso reels a little with the terrible blow but does not go down.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, you dirty yellow sneaking -- Wop! You yellow little Wop! If that's the way you want to play!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATSO>
<DIRECTION>
With his last sentence, Fatso whips out a knife and snaps open the blade. The blade is at least five inches long. It glints evilly as he raises it. There is a concerted whisking intake of breath from the room. Murder is clear on Fat sots face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM SHOT NEAR PREW'S TABLE (EXCLUDING WARDEN) Maggio, holding the stool high, backs up a few feet as Fatso advances toward him. Men sprawl away from them.
</DIRECTION>
<SOLDIER_S_VOICE>

	Hey, it you want to fight, fight with fists. Take it outsides
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLDIER_S_VOICE>

There is a murmur of agreement from the crowd. A couple of men are about to rise. Fatso whirls toward them.
</DIRECTION>
<FATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm gonna cut this little Wop's heart out. Anybody steps in here, I give it to him first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATSO>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM SHOT OLD CHOY AND YOUNG CHOY side by side. Old Choy watches, immobile, his slit eyes almost closed. Young Choy is shaking with fright.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM SHOT FATSO AND MAGGIO Fatso turns toward Maggio, who circles back around the table as the other stalks him.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGGIO>
<DIRECTION>
(scared but brave; shouts)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm gunna de-brain ya, Fatso! One step closer an I'm gunna kill ya!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIO>
<DIRECTION>
Fatso has his knife poised at his shoulder, ready to strike. Warden comes into shot suddenly. He brandishes a beer bottle wildly, looks like an avenging spirit of authority.
</DIRECTION>
<WARDEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nobody's gunna do nothin! Anybody's killin anybody around here, it'll be me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WARDEN>
<DIRECTION>
Warden snatches another beer bottle from a table, now has one in each hand. He steps between Fatso and Maggio.
</DIRECTION>
<FATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look outs here, Warden. This a private affair.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATSO>
<WARDEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No it ain't! This man's in my Compny an I'm responsible for him. And you ain't makin two weeks extra paper work for me by killin him. Nor him you. Put that knife down!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WARDEN>
<DIRECTION>
He smashes the neck off one of the beer bottles, points the wagged edge at Fatso, roars:
</DIRECTION>
<WARDEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put it down!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WARDEN>
<DIRECTION>
Fatso slowly lowers the knife to his waist, but keeps it pointed towards Maggio and Warden. Warden deliberately turns his back to Fatso, spits his words at Maggio.
</DIRECTION>
<WARDEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Killer! You unweaned punk& Come on, you want some killing, come on!

(whirls on Fatso)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, barrelbelly. Ain't you comin?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WARDEN>
<DIRECTION>
Neither Fatso nor Maggio moves.
</DIRECTION>
<WARDEN>
<DIRECTION>
(with mammoth contempt)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Killers! You'll get plenty of killing, all right. More than you got the stomach for. You'll be in a war one of these days. When you feel that lead from a sniper's rifle hit you between the eyes, come and tell me how you like it. Killers!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now put down that chair.

Maggio puts down the stool. Warden turns to Fatso.
</DIRECTION>
<WARDEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Throw that knife on the floor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WARDEN>
<DIRECTION>
Fatso drops the knife. It clatters on the floor. There is another audible whoosh of breath from the room.
</DIRECTION>
<WARDEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Almost scared there wasn't anybody going to stop you for a minute, weren't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(finally lowers his voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is there any other little things you punks'd like me to take care of for you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WARDEN>
<DIRECTION>
He drops the beer bottles on a nearby table, strides to his own table. The room settles back, still hushed. Warden has broken the mood of certain death, but Fatso, still facing Maggio, bites off his words with sadistic, ominous venom.
</DIRECTION>
<FATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tough monkey. Hard sister. Guys like you get to the Stockade sooner later. One day you walk in there I'll be waitin. I'll show you a coupla things.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATSO>
<DIRECTION>
He walks away, drops into a stool at the counter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM SHOT WARDEN'S TABLE Warden stands beside the table, watching. He seems satisfied as Fatso moves away from Maggio. Still standing, he raises his half-filled bottle of beer, drinks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM SHOT PREW'S TABLE Maggio drops onto the stool, sidles it over to the table. He half-whispers to Prew.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGGIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I made a mistake I guess, but I don't see how I could of done anything else, after that big stoop said a thing like that.

Prew leans over and picks the knife off the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<PHEW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll tell you your mistake. You didn't hit him hard enough to put him out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHEW>
<MAGGIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hit him hard as I could. His head must be solid ivory.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIO>
<DIRECTION>
In b.g. Warden puts down the beer bottle and stalks towards the door. Maggio and Prew turn to watch him pass.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGGIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyway, I'm glad he stopped it. He's a good man, you know it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIO>
<DIRECTION>
As if on impulse, Prew rises and follows Warden out.

</DIRECTION>

CLOSE SHOT WARDEN leaning against the building, undergoing a delayed reaction to the fierce moment in Choy's. He is white-faced, sweating heavily. He looks as if he's going to be sick.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT PREW astonished yet appreciative that under Warden's confidence and control in Choy's there has been a human frailty.

</DIRECTION>
<WARDEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You keep it, kid. Keep it for a souvenir.
	</DIALOGUE>

Prew puts the knife in his pocket. They stare at one another a few moments, each inarticulate, each wanting to express some deep emotion of respect.

MEDIUM SHOT AT BAR ALMA AND PREW (NOTE: From this point on "ALMA" will be used instead of "LORENE.") A fashionable Waikiki night spot. An orchestra in b.g, is playing "Someone's Rocking My Dream Boat." Alma and Prew are seated at the bar. She is dressed modestly and becomingly, might well be taken as a society girl. Prew is wearing a civilian suit; he looks bound and choked in it.

One MP is hit in the shoulder, staggers back. Maggio dashes between him and the second MP, but the latter reaches out and grabs him.

MEDIUM SHOT The porch is at the rear of the house, leading off from the living room. It is on the very edge of the cliff. Prew and Alma are dancing to the music of a portable victrola. It is playing "Why Don't We Do This More Often?" A table still contains the dinner plates. Prew's expression holds the wonder of a child at a magic show. He misses a step, stumbles.

	Lissen, I ain't think in of now. But I got a plan cookin in my head. You want to go back to the States in a year. Well, you could stretch it some, make it two years. And I could swing a Sergeant's stripes -- If I were a non-com the Army'd let me pick my duty when I re-enlist.

(IMPASSIONED) Yes, proper. Respectable. Secure. In a year I'll have enough money saved. I'm going back to my home town in Oregon and I'm going to build a new home for my mother and myself and join the country club and take up golf. And then I'll meet the proper, man with the proper position. And I'll be a proper wife who can keep a proper home and raise proper children.

The victrola record ends. Alma turns away from Prew and goes to the victrola. Now that shots had her say with such certainty, she deflates. Except for the fact that she looks like a girl who never cries, she looks as if she might cry. She lifts the record off the turntable.
</DIRECTION>
<ALMA>

MEDIUM SHOT PREW AND GALOVITCH ON LAWN A continuation of the fight. Prew is tiring, his face is cut and bleeding and there is a welt under one eye. Galovitch is unmarked but grunting now from Prew's constant jabs at his stomach. He seems perplexed, as before, by his opponent+s tactics.

ANOTHER ANGLE SHOOTING INTO THE SHADOWS The two figures feint and dart. There is the occasional silver flash of the knives as light hits them.

</DIRECTION>
<COLONEL_WILLIAMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--- In addition to inefficiency in administering his command and neglect of duty, Captain Holmes has been guilty of indefensible cruelty to the aforesaid Private Prewitt. This extended to instigating and encouraging wholly unauthorized and discreditable tactics to force the soldier to join the inter-regiment boxing team. These findings are the result of personal investigation by the Inspector General and are corroborated by numerous members of G Company.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLONEL_WILLIAMS>

Colonel Williams puts his report on the General's desk. Holmes' face reflects a weary resignation as if underneath he has really expected something like this for a long time. He makes no move to speak. The General is angry clear through.

	Holmes, the first thing I ever learned in the Army was that an officer takes care of his men. It seems to be the first thing you forgot. It's monstrous to think of anybody like you in command of troops. And believe me, you won't be for long. My only regret is that we have to keep you in uniform until a court martial is concluded. In the meantime, of course, I'm relieving you of your present duties.

She shakes her head, not wanting to believe; she takes the letter out of his hand, starts to read it. She stops after a sentence or two. Her hand falls to her side. Holmes sits on the bed heavily.

Ross is forceful, clean-cut, gives the impression of toughness but fairness. As he talks he takes down the photographs of prize fighters and prize fighting from the wall. Watching and listening are Sergeants Dhom, Thornhill, Henderson, Leva, Stark and Karelsen and Corporal Wilson. Ross is such a complete switch from Holmes that the men are almost unnerved by him. But a definite respect is reflected in their expressions. Warden, beside his desk, shares this.

CLOSE SHOT WARDEN He has a hunch about this now. He reaches out to put his plate down, holding it very carefully in both hands. However, he doesn't bother to see if there is anything under it. The plate falls and crashes on the floor a fraction of a second before the third groundswell of blast shakes the room.

The men stretch their necks, following the plane. Then they look back up the street, CAMERA PANNING. Far in b.g, a column of black mushrooming to the sky. Warden dashes to Mazzioli. CAMERA MOVES IN to a CLOSE SHOT as Warden bends over him, hoists him to a sitting position. He is extremely gentle. Mazzioli's knee is laid open and is bleeding freely. Warden whips out a handkerchief and starts to apply a tourniquet.

Warden dashes up the porch steps as Choate, Henderson and Dhom launch themselves at the door. Leva steps aside. The door rattles ponderously, then flies open. The three battering rams careen into the Supply Room. The men standing by cheer and rush in after them. Leva shakes his head grimly.

INT. SQUAD ROOM - DAY

FULL SHOT The men are sitting on their bunks, unhappily, holding their rifles. Others who have slept through breakfast are dressing hastily. Warden rushes into the room. The men immediately bark ad-libbed questions at him:

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WARDEN'S ROOM OFF SQUAD ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM SHOT as Warden runs in. Broken glass lies all over the floor. Bullet holes are stitched across the top of Warden's footlocker. He throws back the lid fiercely. His linen is polka-dotted with holes. He tosses out shirts, shorts, etc., digs underneath them. He pulls out a quart bottle of whisky; it is untouched. Warden smiles with relief. He lifts the bottle to his lips, drinks long and heartily.

From this moment on there is no letup of the noise -- there is a wild cacophony of Jap planes, BARs, Karelsen's machine gun, the deep sound of bombs hitting in the far distance. And Chief Choate, singing the Regimental marching song, loudly and lustily.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE as Warden comes up on the roof through the skylight. He shouts incoherently at the men. They shout back in a wild cheer. They are like a pack of hungry men enjoying their first big meal in years. In b.g. the Jap V has swung about and heads back. Warden grabs a BAR from the roof.

He shakes his head vigorously as if to throw off his grogginess. He shakes his head again, slowly, more knowingly now, nodding as if he remembers something from the broadcast of the morning. Then as if all of it hits him suddenly and fully and terribly he wrenches himself off the couch. He looks around at the dimly lit room.

<DIRECTION>
Prew comes back into the room. He has his shoes on, holds civilian shirt and pants in his hand. He starts to put them on hurriedly, his attention still focused on the broadcast. The front door opens and Alma and Gorgette enter. They are surprised to see Prew up. He nods at them, turns back quickly to listen to the radio as he continues dressing.

He picks up the sheet of paper with the "Re-enlistment Blues" written out on it, starts to fold it. Desperation is reflected on Alma's face; she turns to Gorgette, as if pleading for aid,

LONG SHOT SHOOTING FROM SIDE OF HIGHWAY The headlights pass along the road as the jeep moves on out of sight. As its sound fades we hear Prew's heavy breathing, are barely able to distinguish his figure in the darkness. He is crouched, watching the car go down the highway. We hear his thoughts. The voice is labored and agonized.

Still crouched, Prew starts across the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LONG SHOT OPPOSITE SIDE OF ROAD We see nothing but the strip of road, then Prew+s figure is visible, bent low, weaving a little. As he approaches the camera, he is taught square in the twin beams of dimmed headlights which flash on from the side of the road. Now we see that a jeep is parked near camera, heading in the opposite direction from the jeep which passed before. It is also manned by three MPs. There is a startled cry from Prew.
</DIRECTION>
<MP_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Halt!

<DIRECTION>
Prew starts to run back across the road. A white spotlight flashes on, its harsh brilliant light following him. Prew slips to one knee.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT PREW looking toward the jeep, blinded by the blazing light. He has the appearance of a terrified animal. There is a wildness, a senselessness about him. The blotch of blood oozes and spreads over his shirt. He picks up a rock from the road.

MEDIUM SHOT Prew rises, staggers away from the jeep.
</DIRECTION>
<MP_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>

Prew flings the rock desperately toward the lights. There is a crash of glass and one headlight winks off. Prew runs across the road and onto the golf course.

MEDIUM SHOT JEEP The motor starts, The jeep moves out from its hiding place and starts across the golf course.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVING SHOT SHOOTING FROM JEEP Prew, in a skirmisher's zigzag, is trying to elude the spotlight. He is about twenty yards in front of the jeep. He heads for a high sandtrap. The spot is full on him as he reaches the lip of the trap. He turns, yells something back at the jeep. It is barely heard over the sound of the jeep.

MEDIUM SHOT PREW standing on the lip of the trap, the jeep bearing down on him. He turns, starts to dive into the trap. A blast of gunfire from the jeep hits him. He falls sideways into the trap, rolls over on his back, The jeep moves into the shot, crawls half-way over the trap, stops, its spotlight pouring down on Prew. His eyes are open, looking up to the sky.
