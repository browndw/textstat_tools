His arm is propped behind his head as a pillow and he appears to be resting comfortably. MUFFLED VOICES and WHISPERS fill the air but they seem to come from another place. The man doesn't notice them. His name is BUTCH. A gust of wind blows Butch's hair a bit and a piece of straw wipes across his forehead. Then, oddly enough, it is followed by a dollar bill, which rests against his cheek, then skitters across his face. It is followed by another and another, a five, a ten, a single. Butch pays no attention. He's in another world. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - MADISONVILLE, TX. - DUSK SUPERSCRIPT: OCTOBER, 1963. A small country town.

Phillip reaches down and slowly picks up the gun by the handle. He takes one step toward Butch, then another. Gladys, petrified, sobs. Phillip arrives armslength from Butch. CLOSEUPS - PHILLIP AND BUTCH

<DIRECTION>
Butch laughs and then a NOISE from outside brings him back to reality. He grabs the gun and spins to see... MR. CUMMINGS Standing outside the screen door, gun leveled. Before the old man can utter a syllable, Butch grabs Phillip and points the gun straight at Cummings. Jerry jumps up and grabs Gladys.
</DIRECTION>
<BUTCH>

Silence. Gladys can't believe her ears. Then...
</DIRECTION>
<GLADYS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nooooo!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry tosses Gladys aside. She collapses onto the floor. The TWINS instantly start to CRY. Phillip winds up and hits Butch as hard as he can. Butch picks him up, directs Cummings into the kitchen with the gun and nods for Jerry to lead.

INT. RED'S OFFICE - DAY Garnett, still in the same clothes, rests the phone receiver in his ear while he shuffles through the files before him. Red's deputy and boy friday, TOM ADLER, 40, lank, thinning hair, with a face as soft as Red's is hard, warms up Red's coffee with a jolt from the Chief's favorite plaid Thermos.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Johnny, I do understand that...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The jabbering on the other end of the phone line continues as Red's eyes squint to read the files. INSERT - FILES The first is Jerry's, complete with a grinning mug shot in the upper right hand corner. There are several pages in the file, but Red's fingers quickly peruse the top rap sheet before turning to... INSERT - SECOND FILE It's Butch's and again Red's fingers start to move down the page then they stop and move to the photo of Butch at the top of the page. RED'S FACE A hint of recognition. The jabbering continues... CLOSEUP - PHOTO OF BUTCH A little younger than now. A younger con with the grim facade of a man facing hard time.

RED keeps staring at the photo, oblivious to the phone conversa- tion he's "not having".

	<DIALOGUE>
	Press has been waiting almost an hour, Red.

<DIRECTION>
Red nods then notices someone at the door and motions her in... SALLY GERBER, 28, cute in a plain, no nonsense way, with giant curls accenting her round face in step with the latest hair fashions, enters the room, closes the door behind her. She's nervous as hell but trying to hide it. Red motions her to have a seat while he finishes his call.

	I believe you have me confused. I'm here from Huntsville. Assigned by Governor Connally.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Red is confused. He turns a blank expression to Adler.
</DIRECTION>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Adler... what is this?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Adler searches the messy desk for something.
</DIRECTION>
<ADLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rings a bell, Red. Believ' they sent us something about her this mornin'...
	</DIALOGUE>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who sent?...
	</DIALOGUE>
<ADLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Guvner', Red.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Adler finds the telex message sheet he's looking for and hands it to Red.
</DIRECTION>
<ADLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Here it is.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SALLY>
<DIRECTION>
(introducing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, I'm Sally Gerber. Criminologist with the State Prison System.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Sally offers her hand. Red, perusing the telex, ignores but Adler shakes somewhat reluctantly, not sure if he's supposed to like her or not.
</DIRECTION>
<ADLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tom Adler. Deputy. State Police... System.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADLER>
<SALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a relatively new procedure but I was assigned by Governor Connally...
	</DIALOGUE>
<RED>
<DIRECTION>
(reading from telex)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... 'to work with State law enforcement officials in all affairs where penal matters coincide with those of the State Police.' It don't say nuthin' about...

Adler hangs up the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<ADLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gettin' antsy, Red. You scheduled it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Adler hangs up, grabs Red's tie and coat from a brass rung on the wall and hands them over. Red puts down the telex, stares at Sally and reluctantly attempts to make himself presentable.
</DIRECTION>
<SALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The idea is that an understanding of the particular behavioral case histories should, in parole situations, help the subject to avoid habitual traps and, in penal escape situations could, conversely, identify those self-same traps as an aide to apprehension.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Adler stares at Sally then turns to Red with a "never heard the like" look of amazement on his face. Red, roguishly handsome in his tan, western cut blazer, clip on tie and ten gallon hat, makes his way to the door. But, before he exits...
</DIRECTION>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In the first place, Miss Gerber.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sally, please.
	</DIALOGUE>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In the first place, Sally, it ain't a 'penal escape situation.' It's a manhunt. Fancy words in a circle don't help much.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what does?
	</DIALOGUE>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A nose like a Blue Tick, a medulla with an antenna and one helluva lot of coffee.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
And with that he's out the door. INT. PRESS ROOM - DAY A throng of photogs and news writers stuff the undersized room. The clamor settles when Red enters and steps behind the lectern.
</DIRECTION>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen up, I'll only say it once. At approximately ten o'clock last night two inmates over to Huntsville, Robert 'Butch' Haynes and Jerry David Pugh, escaped through an air shaft, grabbed a prison employee's car and got out through the main gate. At approximately 1 A.M. we believe they robbed a market outside of Cut-n-Shoot and killed the store's owner.
	</DIALOGUE>
<REPORTER_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is the prison employee with them?
	</DIALOGUE>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was when they left the prison.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Sally and Adler enter the room and stand beside the lectern observing. Red notices them.
</DIRECTION>
<REPORTER_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the rap sheet on these guys like?
	</DIALOGUE>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Long as Christmas eve to a kid. Haynes was doin' 40 for armed robbery and Pugh was ridin' 20 hisself for manslaughter and assorted parole vios.
	</DIALOGUE>
<REPORTER_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is there any indication of...
	</DIALOGUE>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Lemme' finish, Billy. This mornin' another hostage was taken... from a private home in Madisonville. A boy, age 8. Grabbed him out of bed.
	</DIALOGUE>
<REPORTER_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Any sex offenses on Haynes or Pugh?

<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yer' askin' if they're preverts. Well, one is.
	</DIALOGUE>
<REPORTER_4>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got inter-agency cooperation on this?
	</DIALOGUE>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Texas Rangers as the criminal investigation arm of the D.P.S. share responsibility with the F.B.I. due to the kid being taken. But I doubt they're out of bed yet.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A few chuckles.
</DIRECTION>
<REPORTER_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Red, how do you plan to apprehend the escapees?
	</DIALOGUE>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Officially I can only say we have a full manhunt team on their trail and we'll proceed with due haste.
	</DIALOGUE>
<REPORTER_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And unofficially?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Red hesitates a moment, something's bothering him, then blurts out...
</DIRECTION>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Unoffically? I'm gonna' hunt 'em like the rabid dogs they are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REPORTER_3>
<DIRECTION>
Every hand in the place shoots up and Ad Lib questions fly like bullets.
</DIRECTION>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's all I've got but I'd like to introduce ya' to Miss Sally Gerber. She's straight from the Governor's office. Knows all about psychological profiles and the like. You probably have some questions for her.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Red steps back and to one side. Sally is taken aback but then warms to the idea and steps to the podium for her first press conference, ready to take on the tough questions, to show off a bit, but....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There are no questions. In fact there is utter silence as every raised hand drops. Eyes stare. Red sighs and starts to walk away.
</DIRECTION>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, fellas, I got work to do.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
And he heads out the door, followed by Sally's eyes and every reporter's in the room, who commence once again to yell out questions and mob after the Chief. Every reporter, that is, except one. He's near the back of the room and he smiles and raises his hand. Sally, unsure what to do, looks to him...
</DIRECTION>
<SALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have a question?
	</DIALOGUE>
<REPORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes I do.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Sally smiles a bit then puts on her serious face awaiting...
</DIRECTION>
<REPORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You doin' anything tonight?

Sally, steamed, glares at the guy and stomps out of the room.

	We got a handful of caps and yer' shootin' water tanks. He's a smart guy, huh, Phillip?
	</DIALOGUE>

Phillip doesn't move or change expression. Jerry smiles, almost to himself, and FIRES TWICE more for the hell of it. The ROOF of the Impala EXPLODES with two holes as the car speeds off down the highway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY Red is finishing up with several reporters near the door to the parking lot. Adler jumps in, holds up his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<ADLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, that's it, boys. Chief's got work to do.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Red and Adler move through the parking lot to SAUNDERS, 50, an aide to the Governor. Saunder's seconds are a PHOTOGRAPHER, young and energetic, and SUTTLE, 35, dark-haired, with a cowlick. Saunders shakes Red's hand and they turn to gaze upon... '60-STYLE AIRSTREAM MOBILE HOME parked in the middle of the lot hitched to the back of a new Chevy truck. The Airstream is painted in state colors and sports banners, decals and logos.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY Saunders follows Red as he walks around the showpiece, occasionally kicking a tire or two.
</DIRECTION>
<SAUNDERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So whattaya' think?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Saunders motions for the Photographer to come closer and take pictures. He moves in next to Red and poses as the camera clicks.
</DIRECTION>
<SAUNDERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We are very proud of this baby. Governor Connally special ordered it so state officials and dignitaries can ride in the parade in Dallas. You know President Kennedy's comin'?

<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So I hear.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SAUNDERS>

	Latest technology, oversized engine, complete kitchen and sleeping quarters, gun racks, frig, stove, the works. Even got a hot line phone straight to the Governor's office.

<RED>

	Fine piece of machinery.

<SAUNDERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's more, as soon as it gets back from Dallas it will be at your requisitioned disposal. Perfect for lots of situations -- a headquarters on wheels.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Red smiles, walks up to one of the Lone Star decals and rips it off.
</DIRECTION>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll take it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SAUNDERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, Chief?....
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Red rips off another decal. Adler and a few others start to load equipment, guns and files into the motor home. In addition they cart out unecessary items: mattresses, etc. and stack them in a pile outside the motor home. The Photographer continues to snap photos.

<SAUNDERS>

<DIRECTION>
Red does away with the parade banner. Saunders follows behind and tries to reinstate the decal.
</DIRECTION>
<SAUNDERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's jus' not possible, Red. The Governor's gonna' ride it in a campaign parade tomorrow.
	</DIALOGUE>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guvner' hisself told me this manhunt was top priority.

Adler moves through the door to the RV carrying Red's favorite desk chair. He's followed by BOBBY LEE, 20's, cocksure, wearing a plain khaki uniform and boots.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	S'cuse me.

	<DIALOGUE>
	This here's Bobby Lee. He's a specialist with the Feds. They want him to tag along.

Red stares hard at Bobby Lee, then nods. Bobby Lee steps into the Airstream.
</DIRECTION>
<SAUNDERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, Red, ya' gotta' believe me...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Red spots Suttle, 35, bright-eyed, with a cowlick, sitting at the wheel of the Chevy truck.

<SUTTLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dick Suttle, the driver.

BRADLEY, 35, glasses, moves to the truck and gets in. Suttle shrugs and steps out. Saunders stops Suttle and turns to Red.
</DIRECTION>
<SAUNDERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This man stays with the vehicle wherever it goes, Red!

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grab a seat.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Suttle sets himself in the passenger seat of the truck. Sally emerges from the building, ticked off, carrying an armload of file boxes, and makes a beeline for Red. Saunders gently touches Red's shoulders; a final plea.
</DIRECTION>
<SAUNDERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please Red, I'm beggin'. I mean, what am I suppose to tell the Governor?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Sally arrives but before she can spit out a word...
</DIRECTION>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell John that Miss Gerber here checked me out on it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Red whistles and the ENGINE REVS. Red closes the door as the motor home pulls away. Saunders runs beside the passenger side window and yells in to Suttle, who stares out the window.
</DIRECTION>
<SAUNDERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not a scratch, you hear me, Suttle? Not a scratch!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Saunders stops, breathing hard, next to Sally. She's pissed and overloaded with files. AIRSTREAM about 20 yards down the way, comes to a stop. A second later the door opens and the steps pop out. Sally walks toward the bus but when she arrives at the door... ... LAUGHTER filters out of the Airstream. The Airstream moves another 20 feet then stops. Sally waits a full five seconds, then she blows the hair out of her eyes and, against her better judgment, moves cautiously forward, the file boxes getting heavier by the minute. Again, when she gets close...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...the Airstream moves. Sally, boiling mad as her coiffure wilts in the Texas sun, stops, and tosses down the file box in anger. The Airstream stops. LAUGHTER from inside and a few AD LIBS, i.e. -- "Okay, Okay." More LAUGHTER. Red steps out the door, turns his gaze back inside and the laughter and comments stop on a dime. Smiling slightly he turns to Sally, moves straight for the file box, picks it up and walks back to the Airstream. When he arrives at the steps he turns, looks to Sally, who stews and holds her ground.
</DIRECTION>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You comin' or not?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She hesitates only a moment before walking straight to Red, grabbing back her file box and entering in front of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AIRSTREAM - DAY Sally enters, balancing the boxes, and glares at the faces surrounding her. A smiling Red, a grinning Adler messily gorging on a cinnamon roll, a nervous KAISER, the radio man, and, in the corner, a nasty smirk from Bobby Lee. When the Airstream takes off again, she loses her balance and drops one of the boxes. Adler and Suttle jump forward to help but she gives them the evil eye.
</DIRECTION>
<SALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She kneels down to pick it up and feels eyes on her. She looks up to the men staring at... Her skirt, raised a bit, exposing a thigh. She calmly stands and looks to Adler, a piece of cinnamon roll dangling on his chin.

Red can't help but smile as Adler wipes at his face. EXT. RURAL ROAD - DAY The IMPALA BLASTS along, kicking up dust and dispersing crows as it heads into a one light township. It slows, however, before the main part of town and slides to a stop near a pay phone booth. INT./EXT. IMPALA - DAY

In the b.g. Jerry rips the 20 page phone book in half and returns to the car, half pleased with himself. He tosses the keys to Butch, who starts the car and drives off.

Butch reaches over, takes Phillip's hand and places it on the steering wheel.

Phillip, scared at the prospect, nevertheless does his best to see over the dash and keep the wheel straight. Butch turns back over the seat to confront Jerry.
</DIRECTION>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In two seconds I'm gonna' break your nose. That's a threat...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Before Jerry has time to snicker Butch hits him full in the face and grabs the gun. Blood spurts from Jerry's nose and the injured man cups his hands over the wound. Butch spins and retakes the wheel from a frightened Phillip.
</DIRECTION>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... And that's a fact.

Instead of expressing outrage, Jerry slinks back down in the seat wearing a look of pure hatred.

Jerry raises his hands, palms up and slowly leans forward in the back seat. Phillip's hand quivers but he doesn't pull the trigger.

<DIRECTION>
As Jerry groans, Phillip seizes the moment and bites Jerry hard on the ear. Jerry screams and drops the gun, which Phillip picks up and carries with him as he scurries out of the car and into the hay field. Jerry, in pain, now with both ears bleeding, crawls out of the back seat and gives chase.

EXT. FIELD - DAY Phillip, still sobbing, runs for his life in the hay, which is a full foot taller than he. JERRY no longer stumbling, now grinning maniacally, gives chase, whistling as if calling for a lost puppy.

HIS POV The hay rustles as Jerry moves through the field. EXT. FIELD - DAY Jerry, crouching, moves through the field -- eyes peeled for any sign of Phillip. Phillip lies still. He hears the hay rustling near him and he looks up, squares his body and points the revolver at...

Butch, who spots him, motions for him to stay put and holds out his hand for the gun. Phillip hands it over and watches while Butch reaches into the plaid jacket pocket, extracts a few shells and loads the .38. JERRY a little frustrated now, but still moving forward.

The cars don't even slow at the sight of the scarecrow, blast- ing right through it, sending hay, hat, limbs and all, flying. The scarecrow, or what's left of it, lands in a ditch next to the boys.

EXT. RURAL ROAD - DAY The four Highway Patrol VEHICLES from before BLAST past at 90+, sending stray dogs and roadrunners scurrying for cover. CRANE DOWN to reveal the Ford off the same roadside, but behind a burm in a field. As soon as the patrol cars pass, Butch STARTS up the ENGINE and humps it to the road and off in the opposite direction. INT. AIRSTREAM - DAY Sally, deep in her files. She looks up from the file to...

BACK TO SCENE The Woman returns with an armload of anything she could find in the kitchen. Phillip gratefully opens his sack and watches as the Woman drops in a loaf of bread, a jar of mustard, candies, jams, butter and anything else she could find. Empty-handed she reaches inside the door, opens her purse and dumps her money -- a couple of dollars and lots of change into the bag.

<DIRECTION>
Phillip lays out six more slices. The dashboard is now covered with bread. Phillip pulls out the mustard but has no knife. Butch pulls out a stick of gum and hands it to Phillip to spread with. As they drive along they pass a large, happy family (Mom, Dad, girl 5, boy 7) picnicking in the dip of a long hill alongside the highway. From the look of their brand-new loaded down station wagon they are on vacation. CLOSEUP - PHILLIP Mesmerized by the family. CLOSEUP - BUTCH Ditto. He pulls his eyes back to the road, notices something. EXT. ROAD - DAY Butch brings the car to a stop near the crest of the hill, sets the emergency brake, grabs the first completed mustard sandwich and gets out, leaving the Impala running.

<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IDLING as they wait their turn to pass a roadblock at the bottom of the hill. PHILLIP spreading even more mustard. Every so often he sneaks a peek back at the picnicing family. EMERGENCY BRAKE slips a little, then gives all at once. FORD starts to roll backwards.

<DIRECTION>
He jumps in the Driver's seat of the WAGON and frantically REVS it just as... PHILLIP gains control of the wheel and steers the rapidly reversing Ford around the Wagon. FORD continues backwards to the bottom of the hill, but it has enough steam built up to head backwards up the other incline of the previous hill. BUTCH comes to a heaving halt next to Bob, who is near heart attack himself.

EXT. FIELD - AIRSTREAM - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SIRLOIN STEAK hits a grill beside a Tater Tot shiskabob and SIZZLES to beat the band. A homemade barbecue pit, built from nearby abundant rocks, sits square in the middle of the highway with red flares set up just in case a car did come by. Red smiles and shakes a liberal dose of Lea and Perrins onto the flesh. He's obviously a veteran of many back yard B-BQs and this is definitely one. We see Sally THROUGH the window. She's inside, still going over her files. She gets up and walks into the back room to look for something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOBBY LEE sitting outside, rises and slides into the Airstream while BACK TO SCENE Red continues to cook with Adler and Bradley looking on. INT. AIRSTREAM - BACKROOM - DUSK Sally turns on a nightlight and looks at herself in the mirror. She splashes a little water on her face and is startled when ... Bobby Lee slides in behind her.

INT. DOTTIE'S CAFE - NIGHT Phillip, at the booth, plays with the parsley on his empty plate, which sits across from Butch's barely touched one. The boy looks over his shoulder and sneaks a peek at Butch, who sits at a barstool watching Eileen work behind the counter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT COUNTER Butch leans over and whispers something sexy into Eileen's ear. She giggles and licks her lips. Butch feels eyes on his back and looks at Phillip, who immediately turns away from them. When Butch returns his attention to Eileen she's moved a few feet away and is refilling ketchup bottles.
</DIRECTION>
<BUTCH>

<DIRECTION>
Butch, a tad annoyed, turns to Phillip and gives him a look. Once again, when he turns back, Eileen has moved. She's flirting with Butch, moving, bending, wiping her hands on her hips. His eyes are focused on her every squirm.
</DIRECTION>
<BUTCH>
<DIRECTION>
(over his shoulder)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay now, Buzz, you go on out in the parking lot and chunk some rocks or something.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE Phillip reluctantly slides down off the stool and slowly walks out the door. His eyes stay on Butch and Eileen, barely concealing confusion mixed with a hint of jealousy.
</DIRECTION>
<EILEEN>

	So is she dead or not?
	</DIALOGUE>
<BUTCH>
<DIRECTION>

	</DIALOGUE>
<EILEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm so sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
But she's not. In fact it seems to have turned her on even more. She puts her hand behind Butch's neck and slowly pulls him close for gentle kiss. EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT Phillip tosses a rock then turns to the diner. They're gone. Phillip drops his handful of rocks and walks to the front window of the diner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PHILLIP'S POV - DINER It is empty. He sees that the kitchen swinging door is still swinging on its hinges. INT. DINER - ADJUNCT OFFICE - NIGHT A one room addition office built onto the kitchen. It has a desk against one wall, a few chairs, a fan -- pretty sparse. Two large windows throw light from the outside neon sign onto the room. A large lamp provides harsh light. Eileen leads Butch by the hand into the room, closing the door behind them. At once they are all over each other. Butch lifts her up onto the desk and starts to kiss her face and neck. Then, in an instant, he flips her over, pulls the ribbon from her hair and unzips the back of her waitress outfit to the waist. He kisses her neck, her back and suddenly, passionately, he flips up her skirt and begins kissing her voluptuous backside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DINER - NIGHT Phillip, a bit scared, moves around the side of the front of the diner and sees something. PHILLIP'S POV - THROUGH WINDOW In profile Butch continues to kiss Eileen's buttocks. She moans in ecstasy. BACK TO SCENE Phillip, like a pacifist at a prizefight, doesn't want to watch but can't not watch. He moves down the wall to a window positioned right at the desk. When he stops he's right in front of the window, separated from Butch and Eileen by only a foot of air and a thin plate of glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PHILLIP'S POV - BUTCH AND EILEEN Kissing, writhing, but FROM this ANGLE all he can really see is a mane of hair swinging to and fro. Butch is out of sight but it's obvious that his lips continue to caress Eileen's backside. She cranes her neck, arching it like a swan, moaning like a wildebeast and then... She stops and stares STRAIGHT AHEAD. Butch continues to kiss but only for a beat, sensing the locomotive he's on has stopped at an unscheduled station. He slides his face from around her rear, a la Kilroy, and he stares, too. Except for their continuing heavy breathing they could be modern art statues staring STRAIGHT AHEAD AT... INT. OFFICE - REVERSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Phillip's nose is pressed to the glass. In fact if he pressed any harder there wouldn't be any glass. BUTCH AND EILEEN hold their pose for a second until... PHILLIP comes back to real time and bolts away into the darkness of the parking lot.

But Butch, still at the window, just keeps breathing. EXT. DOTTIE'S CAFE - ANGLE ON SKY - NIGHT (SECONDS LATER) Nothing but stars swimming in black West Texas crude. PHILLIP stands right next to the SPUTTERING NEON SIGN, staring straight up, the neon light splashing his face in a grotesque pink light.

For a second it's as if none of this has happened, that Butch will grasp Phillip in his arms... A DEAFENING GUNBLAST turns his expression to blank. Phillip, knocked to the floor by the revolver's kick, recovers to his knees, shaking like a leaf. The MAMBO RECORD comes to an END, but SCRATCHES ON AD INFINITUM.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A few hundred yards back, Butch struggles forward. BACK TO SCENE Phillip crawls through the ditch beside the road and squeezes through a barb wire fence. His costume hangs on a barb.

clad in his white costume, running across a field toward a grove of trees beside the creek. BACK TO SCENE Arch continues on down the road and passes...

</DIRECTION>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was a helluva' thing to do, Phillip. You're a hero. Prolly' be in all the papers tomorrow, how you saved those folks. Truth is, I don't think I woulda' killed 'em. I only killed two people in my whole life. One hurt my mama and one hurt you.

	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
PHILLIP finally arrives at the creek, looking over his shoulder all the way. He looks at the water -- deep and running swift. Where to go? He decides and heads for the nearest tree -- a big oak, and shimmies up to a branch ten feet or so above the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. LOCAL BLACK AND WHITE - DAY A country cop answering the report, drives slowly down the road, his pistol drawn and held upright in one hand. He pulls into Mack's driveway and parks. Arch walks out of the house to greet him.

Inside is... a high-powered military rifle in three parts. Hands unzip a velvetine bag and pull out a high-powered scope. Bobby Lee holds the lens of the scope to his mouth, blows a breath on it and wipes it clean with a piece of clean cloth. He feels eyes and turns to see... Sally, watching him at work.

<DIRECTION>
Gladys, near shock, AD LIBS commands to Phillip. "Come on honey," "Phillip, keep walking," that kind of thing. (NOTE: Her commands become more and more shrieking and frantic and continue throughout, giving rise to even more confusion than is already present.) EXT. FIELD - DAY Phillip turns back and sees ... Butch -- He tries to get up in an attempt to make a run for it, but his strength is gone. He collapses. Phillip, standing still, with his mother's shrieks filling the air behind him, watches Butch for a second then runs back toward him. EXT. ROADSIDE - DAY Red sighs and lowers the binocs. EXT.

<DIRECTION>
But Red's not listening, just walking, long and tall, into the field. EXT. FIELD - DAY Butch and Phillip continue to walk, Butch holding Phillip's hand. When Butch spots Red approaching he slows and then stops. Red shows his palms and keeps walking toward them. When he gets within 25 feet he stops.

Butch reaches into his back pocket... IN FIELD Red squints to make out what Butch's reaching for. HIS POV Butch smiles as he retrieves the POSTCARD from his pocket. BACK TO SCENE A look of concern crosses Red's lips... ROADSIDE Sally realizes it's not a gun that Butch is reaching for.
</DIRECTION>

	Noooooo...!!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
FINGER ON TRIGGER squeezes -- An EXPLOSION followed by a RINGING ECHO. IN FIELD Butch's chest explodes when the bullet hits him. He rocks backwards, still on his knees... and looks at Phillip in amazement. Phillip screams, grabs Butch and holds him up. THROUGH CROSSHAIRS OF GUN Phillip is obscuring a second shot at Butch. BUTCH tastes blood and sighs.
</DIRECTION>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn, Buzz, shot twice in the same day.

He collapses and falls into Phillip's arms. Phillip backs away two steps and falls to his knees. Butch wavers for a second then topples on his back. Phillip moans, sobs, as he watches Butch, the GUNSHOT still ECHOING. AT ROADSIDE Gladys runs from behind the car, followed by a host of officers.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROADSIDE Red walks up to Bobby Lee, stops and stares at the grinning marksman. After a beat, Red turns then nearly jumps out of shoes with a sudden right cross that floors the younger man. Red starts to jump in for more but Hendricks, stunned, jumps in, grabs Red and, joined by four other Officers, holds the older man back. Shouting, i.e. "Hey, hey, Red, whoa, whoa!" Red settles a bit. Hendricks turns to Bobby Lee who rises to one knee and wipes at a bloody lip, and then to Red who is still breathing hard.
</DIRECTION>
<HENDRICKS>

<ADLER>

	I thought he had a gun, too, Red. There was just no way of knowin'.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Red doesn't even look at Adler, just keeps walking. Adler stops, his eyes following Red. Sally, nearby, watches Red walk away. PHILLIP is helped to his feet by his mother. She holds him dearly to her chest. He hugs back just as hard, his blood-stained Casper outfit staining her blouse. She unzips the costume and dollar bills fly all around. She starts to lead Phillip off but he won't leave until... He pulls the postcard from Butch's hand. CLOSEUP - PHILLIP Staring down at Butch. CLOSEUP - BUTCH His eyes flutter a bit with recognition.

AT PATROL CAR Red leans against the car. After a few seconds Sally walks up and finds a spot a few feet down from him where she, too, leans against the car. After a few more seconds.

Red reaches into his pocket, pulls out his tobacco and stuffs a chunk into his mouth. IN FIELD - CLOSEUP - BUTCH He licks his lips as the MUFFLED VOICES CONTINUE around him. He squints hard and sees: HELICOPTER as it lifts off and speeds away. As it wipes the sun... CLOSEUP - BUTCH A slight smile crosses his dying face as he squints to see Phillip's flight. CLOSEUP - PHILLIP Nose pressed against the glass bubble. BUTCH His eyes don't close, still squinted but frozen. CLOSEUP - EYES We realize now, are lifeless. BUZZARD continues its flight past the sun. SUN flares, SENDING the SCREEN TO:
