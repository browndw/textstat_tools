Engraved on it are the words: COX & CO., Bankers. Reflected in its shiny surface are double-decker red buses, and other present-day London traffic.

INT. BANK VAULT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An iron gate opens, and two bank guards come in. One of them switches on the lights. On the shelves which line the walls are dusty strong-boxes, document cases, wrapped packages, etc. The guards move along the shelves searching for something.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Somewhere in the vaults of a bank in London is a tin dispatch box with my name on it. It is not to be opened until fifty years after my death.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The guards find a battered tin dispatch box with the name JOHN H. WATSON, M.D., painted on it. They remove it from the shelf, set it down on a table. The box is tied with heavy cord, the knots sealed with wax. Strung on the cord is the key.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It contains certain mementos of my long association with a man who elevated the science of deduction to an art -- the world's first, and undoubtedly most famous, consulting detective.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
While one of the guards dusts the box off, the other cuts the cord with a pair of scissors. He then inserts the key in the lock, turns it, raises the lid -- revealing the dusty contents of the box.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OVER THIS, SUPERIMPOSE THE MAIN TITLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The guards now start to remove the objects from the box, one at a time: -- A daguerreotype of Holmes, standing, and Watson, seated, in a a stiff studio pose; Holmes' deerstalker hat, his curved pipe, his magnifying glass; Watson's stethoscope, Holmes' revolver; a small enamel sign with the number 221B; a pair of handcuffs;
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
a sheet of music paper which is unrolled to disclose a violin piece composed by Holmes, titled FOR ILSE von H.; A pocket watch, the back of which is opened to reveal a photograph of Gabrielle Valladon; a signet ring bearing the initials S.H. -- under which is concealed a compass; a worn morocco case -- inside which is an early-model hypodermic syringe; a crystal ball which, when shaken, produces a snowstorm - and when the snow settles, we see a bust of Queen Victoria.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OVER THESE OBJECTS, THE REST OF THE CREDIT TITLES ARE SUPERIMPOSED.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The last item out of the box is a thick stack of manuscript paper, bound with green ribbon. The guard undoes the ribbon, dusts off the top page, as CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSER. Written in ink, in the cursive penmanship of the period, is the following paragraph:
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To my heirs:
	</DIALOGUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In my lifetime, I have recorded some sixty cases demonstrating the singular gift of my friend Sherlock Holmes -- dealing with everything from The Hound of the Baskervilles to his mysterious brother Mycroft and the devilish Professor Moriarty. But there were other adventures which, for reasons of discretion, I have decided to withhold from the public until this much later date. They involve matters of a delicate and sometimes scandalous nature, as will shortly become apparent.

A passenger train of the late Nineteenth Century is chugging through the early morning mist.

	It was August of 1887, and we were returning from Yorkshire, where Holmes had solved the baffling murder of Colonel Abernetty.

INT. COMPARTMENT - MOVING TRAIN - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There are but two passengers in the compartment -- sitting by the window, facing each other. In fact they are dozing. One wears a deerstalker and an Inverness cape; the other is in a dark overcoat and a black bowler, a furled umbrella between his legs, a medical bag on the seat beside him. The rest of their luggage is on the racks above. They are, of course, SHERLOCK HOLMES and DR. JOHN H. WATSON. This being 1887, they are thirty- three and thirty-five respectively.

EXT. BAKER STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hansom cab, with Holmes' and Watson's luggage strapped to the rack on top, is proceeding down the busy street.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was the most brilliant man I have ever known -- and I dare say people have envied me for sharing that flat with him in Baker Street.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The cab draws up in front of 221B. The front door opens and MRS. HUDSON, a plump, motherly woman in her fifties, wearing an apron, hurries down the steps. She greets Holmes and Watson warmly as they alight.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll grant you he was stimulating -- but he could also be moody, unpredictable, egocentric, and more often than not, completely infuriating -- as our landlady, Mrs. Hudson, can attest -- bless her kind soul.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The cabbie starts to unload their luggage. As Holmes, Watson and Mrs. Hudson proceed inside, CAMERA TRAVELS UP THE FACADE OF THE BUILDING, past the number 221B, to the bay window on the second floor.

INT. LIVING ROOM - 221B BAKER STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's all there -- the fireplace, the coal scuttle, the Persian slipper with the tobacco; the velvet wing chair, the basket chair with the writing-arm, the couch with the cushions; the sideboard with the tantalus and the gasogene; the acid-stained deal-topped table with Holmes' chemical equipment on it, the dining table, the small Moorish table; the bookshelves and the violin case; the gas fixtures and the oil lamps; the dumbwaiter connecting with the kitchen in the basement; and Holmes' desk, piled high with papers, clippings, research material, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes is pulling up the window shades. Watson has removed his hat and coat, and is putting his medical bag down on the sideboard; the cabbie, having deposited their luggage, is just leaving.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_HUDSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do wish you'd give me a little more warning when you come home unexpected. I would have roasted a goose -- and had some flowers for you.

	My dear Mrs. Hudson -- criminals are as unpredictable as head-colds. You never quite know when you're going to catch one.

He has picked up a dagger, starts opening his mail, which is on the dining table.

<MRS_HUDSON>

<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just what do you mean by that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, come now, Watson, you must admit that you have a tendency to over-romanticize. You have taken my simple exercises in logic and embellished them, exaggerated them...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I deny the accusation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>

	<DIALOGUE>
	You have described me as six-foot-four, whereas I am barely six-foot-one.

<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's those little touches that make you colorful --
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lurid is more like it. You have painted me as a hopeless dope addict -- just because I occasionally take a five per cent solution of cocaine.

</HOLMES>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A seven per cent solution.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Five per cent. Don't you think I'm aware you've been diluting it behind my back?

	As a doctor -- and as your friend -- I strongly disapprove of this insidious habit of yours.

	My dear friend -- as well as my dear doctor -- I only resort to narcotics when I am suffering from acute boredom -- when there are no interesting cases to engage my mind.

	Did you say midgets?

<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Disappeared between London and Bristol ... Don't you find that intriguing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Extremely so. You see, they are not only midgets -- but also anarchists.

	Anarchists?

</HOLMES>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You really think so?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not at all. The circus owner offers me five pounds for my services -- that's not even a pound a midget.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So obviously he is a stingy blighter, and the little chaps simply ran off to join another circus.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. And it sounded so promising --

</WATSON>
<HOLMES>

	There are no great crimes anymore, Watson. The criminal class has lost all enterprise and originality. At best they commit some bungling villainy, with a motive so transparent that even a Scotland Yard official can see through it.

INT. LIVING ROOM - EVENING

<DIRECTION>
START on Holmes' foot, operating a bellows. CAMERA PANS UP to the top of the chemistry table, on which an elaborate apparatus of brass, glass and rubber tubing has been set up. Inserted into the ends of the rubber tubes are half a dozen cigarettes, four cigars of different shapes and colors, and four pipes, all lit. Activated by the bellows, they are puffing away like mad, wheezing loudly and filling the screen with smoke. Seated at the table is Holmes, in shirt-sleeves. Occasionally he knocks off an ash onto a glass slide, studies it under a microscope.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watson, in a dressing gown, is sitting in the chair with the writing arm, documenting the latest Holmes adventure for Strand Magazine. The open mail has now been affixed to the center of the wooden mantelpiece, with a dagger.

Mrs. Hudson is clearing the dinner dishes from the table, and loading them onto the shelf of the dumbwaiter. The accumulation of smoke in the room makes her cough.

He has tucked the violin under his chin, starts to improvise a nervous pent-up melody. There is nothing amateurish about it -- he plays quite well.

Watson resumes working on his manuscript. Suddenly the music stops. Watson looks up apprehensively. Holmes has put down the violin, and is crossing to the sideboard.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, I'm rather looking forward to it. Leading a normal life again. Regular office hours -- nine to three -- and if occasionally there's an emergency call in the middle of the night, I know it's going be appendicitis and not an ax murder. Let Holmes go mucking about in the fog and the sleet, looking for a bloodstained collar-button out on the moors, with some demented hound snapping at his behind --

From the living room comes the sound of a revolver shot. Mrs. Hudson screams and Watson looks off in alarm. Then he races out of the room, diploma in hand, followed by Mrs. Hudson.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

<DIRECTION>
As they burst into the room, they see Holmes sitting on the stool beside the chemistry table, a revolver in his hand. He has shattered one of the narcotics bottles on the mantelpiece, and is aiming at a second one.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_HUDSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Holmes...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_HUDSON>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes fires, smashing the second bottle. As Mrs. Hudson takes a step forward, he waves her away with the gun.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, Mrs. Hudson. You're in my line of fire.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Watson jerks Mrs. Hudson back as Holmes lets go with another shot. The bullet disposes of the third bottle, splattering glass and liquid all over the place. Holmes rises calmly from the stool, crosses to the desk, puts the revolver away in a drawer.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_HUDSON>

She points up to a spot near the ceiling. Neatly traced in bullet holes are the initials V.R., with a small crown above them.

A bewildered Mrs. Hudson goes back into the bedroom. Watson crosses to the fireplace, picks up the whiskbroom and the coal shovel, starts cleaning up the broken glass.

<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Holmes. I know how difficult it must've been for you --
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not really. It was simple choice between a bad habit and a good companion.

</HOLMES>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've made me very happy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've often been accused of being cold and unemotional. I admit to it. And yet, in my cold, unemotional way, I'm very fond of you, Watson.

</HOLMES>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know that. But one likes to hear these things occasionally.

He notices the violin, which has been splattered with the liquid from the shattered bottle, picks it up.

<HOLMES>

He takes the instrument, and dabbing it with a handkerchief, carries it toward the violin case.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For a moment, I was worried that you were going to let me walk out -- that you weren't even going to try to stop me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, Watson -- you know there's nothing I wouldn't do to keep you here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
With a side-glance at the busy Watson, he opens the violin case. Neatly stashed away around the edges are the three original bottles of narcotics. The ones he shot up, of course, were substitutes from the chemistry set. He places the violin carefully among the bottles, closes the case, snaps the locks. As he moves off, we STAY on the violin case.

	To tell you truth, you were not first choice. We considered Russian writer, Tolstoi --

Before Holmes can answer, the door opens and Watson sticks his head in. He is flushed and slightly inebriated, and there is a flower tucked behind his ear. From off comes the SOUND of wild balalaika music.

STAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The party has built into a real wingding by now. It's wild -- drinking, laughing, singing. Everybody is turned on -- especially Watson. He is dancing with a dozen of the ballerinas to madly accelerating balalaika music. Flower behind ear, hair mussed, tie undone, short of breath -- he is in paradise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes makes his way through the revelers, approaches Watson.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watson!

(Watson pays no attention)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

<WATSON>

(without missing a step)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it, old boy?

</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're going home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Home? Not a chance. Not the slightest -- not the remotest chance. Toodle-ooo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
He waves goodbye, and goes on swirling dizzily with the girls. Holmes puts on his silk hat and leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A shaken Rogozhin comes up to the buffet, pours himself a stiff drink of vodka. As he drinks his eyes follow the dancing Watson balefully.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watson spins off several of the girls, grabs another group. His ex-partners wind up close to Rogozhin. He whispers something to them. Their eyes widen, and they stare at Watson with disbelief. Watson again switches partners, and the first girls now whisper intensely to those who just left the floor. The same reaction. Watson, oblivious to all this, is whirling around with another set of girls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
By now some of the girls who are in on the secret are whispering to the male dancers in tights. Their reaction is slightly different. They are seeing Watson in a new light. And before Watson knows what's happening, he has been abandoned by all the girls, and is joined first by one pair then another pair of male dancers, till he is dancing only with gay guys in tights. It gradually dawns on Watson that there is something wrong with this state of affairs. After some difficulty, he breaks away from them.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold on! Just a moment!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
Spotting Rogozhin, he crosses to him. The girls shrink away at his approach.

	<DIALOGUE>
	What's going on? What happened to the girls?

<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What way?

</WATSON>
<ROGOZHIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't have to pretend. Mr. Holmes told us everything -- about you and him --

</ROGOZHIN>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	About me and him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<ROGOZHIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come now, no need to be bashful. We are not bourgeois. Maybe with doctors and detectives is unusual -- but in ballet, is very usual.

<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>

</WATSON>
<ROGOZHIN>

Watson looks around at the boys in tights, who are standing in a half-circle, grinning at him insolently. It is beginning to dawn on him. He pales.
</DIRECTION>
<ROGOZHIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- And Ilya and Sergei --

(breaks off, rocks his hand back and forth)
</DIRECTION>

He pours himself another vodka. Watson grabs the glass away from him, downs it with a gulp.

INT. LIVING ROOM - 221B BAKER STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In contrast to the frenetic ambiance of the back-stage party, the room seems doubly placid. Holmes, his dinner coat replaced by a smoking jacket, is sitting in the wing chair, having a quiet pipe after the evening's peculiar adventure. Only the desk lamp is lit. From the street, there is the sound of hurried, angry footsteps approaching the house. Holmes turns his head languidly -- he knows who is coming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BAKER STREET - NIGHT

An enraged Watson, cane and opera glasses in hand, and the flower still behind his ear, is jogging down the center of the deserted street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

Holmes rises casually, twists the wing chair so that its back is to the door, crosses to the lamp on the desk, turns the wick down. From off comes the sound of Watson's key rattling in the front door lock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STAIRCASE - 221B BAKER STREET - NIGHT

The front door opens and Watson storms into the vestibule.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>

</WATSON>

He races up the stairs and across the landing, flings open the door of the flat.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Holmes!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watson, grim and breathless, stands in the open doorway. Over the back of the wing chair, he sees smoke curling up from Holmes' pipe.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There you are, you wretch! You rotter! You blackguard! Of all the vile, unspeakable fabrications. What do you have to say for yourself?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
No answer from Holmes. We now see -- but Watson does not -- that the chair is occupied by a section of Holmes' smoking machine, with the pipe attached.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't just sit there -- speak up, man!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
Still no answer -- just a little pipe smoke drifting up from the wing chair. Incensed, Watson raises the opera glasses, tosses them toward the chair. There is a loud thud, the pipe falls to the floor, then there is silence. Watson suddenly becomes concerned.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holmes...? Are you all right, Holmes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
He approaches the chair apprehensively, shoves it aside -- and there on the floor is the smoking machine, still wheezing slightly. Watson picks it up, and his eyes travel to Holmes, standing in a shadowy corner, working the bellows with his foot.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	From the sound of your footsteps, I gathered that you were not in a particularly amiable mood.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How could you do a dastardly thing like that to me? What the deuce were you thinking of?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
He dashes the smoking machine to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watson, you have my most abject apologies. But have you ever been cornered by a madwoman? It seemed like the only way to get out of it without hurting her feelings.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about my feelings? And my reputation? Do you realize the gravity of what you have done? The possible repercussions?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So there'll be a little gossip about you in St. Petersburg...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These things spread like wildfire. I can just hear those malicious whispers behind my back. I'll never be able to show my face in polite society...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And if it ever got back to my old regiment -- you don't know the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers -- they'll strike me off the rolls -- they'll cut off my pension...
	</DIALOGUE>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watson, you're running amok.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dishonored, disgraced, ostracized. What am I to do?

</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, for one thing, I'd get rid of that flower.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
He points to the flower behind Watson's ear. Watson grabs the flower, hurls it into the fireplace.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You may think this is funny, but we're both in the same boat. We must take desperate measures. We must stop this talk...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat, then an idea)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe if we got married...

	Then they'd really talk...

</HOLMES>
<WATSON>

(starts pacing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Obviously, we cannot continue to live under the same roof. We must move apart.

	Of course, we can still see each other clandestinely -- on remote benches in Hyde Park, and in the waiting rooms of suburban railway stations --

	That's what I've been trying to tell you.

	Let somebody start a rumor -- just one ugly word -- and we'll sue them for slander.

	Nobody would dare. After all, you have an enviable record with the fair sex.

	Damn right. I can get women from three continents to testify for me. And you can get women to vouch for you, too -- can't you, Holmes?

No answer from Holmes. Watson is becoming a little concerned.

He starts toward his bedroom.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope I'm not being presumptuous -- but there have been women in your life?

<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where did she come from?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<CABBIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	From the river. I was driving down the Embankment, just below Westminster Bridge, and there she was in the water -- drowning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABBIE>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes appears on the landing above, violin and bow in his hand.

<MRS_HUDSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Holmes. You can't let him --

</MRS_HUDSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watson, you'd better accept delivery.

Watson fishes some coins out of his pocket, hands them to the cabbie.

He snatches the blanket off Gabrielle, revealing that her dress is clinging to her damply.

(he puts his arm around her)

<DIRECTION>
He starts to lead her up the stairs.

EXT. BAKER STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cabbie has tossed the blanket into the hansom, and is mounting the driver's seat. Across the street, a man steps out of the fog into a pool of light cast by one of the street lamps. He is a craggy-faced Prussian of about fifty, and his name is VON TIRPITZ. He looks up toward the Holmes flat. As the hansom makes a U-turn and comes abreast of him, he hops into the cab. The hansom disappears into the fog.

Watson is leading Gabrielle to a chair by the fireplace. Holmes is putting his violin down on the table.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sit here, my dear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
He settles her in the chair. Holmes comes over, plucks the square of cardboard from Watson's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's suffering from shock and exposure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to massage her wrists to restore her circulation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes is examining the soggy cardboard. On one side is their address, written in pencil. He turns it over, disclosing some smudges of green ink on the other side.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There was some printing on the back of this -- but it seems to have come off in the water.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Watson is now studying the bruise on Gabrielle's temple.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at this -- she's had a nasty blow on the head.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could she have hit her head when she fell or jumped into the river?
	</DIALOGUE>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. The blood has already coagulated. So it would appear that she was the victim of a deliberate attack... Get my bag, will you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
As Holmes fetches the medical bag, Gabrielle looks from one to the other.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIELLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIELLE>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm Dr. Watson -- and this is Mr. Sherlock Holmes. Do the names mean anything to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<GABRIELLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.

</GABRIELLE>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's obviously had a concussion -- which often leads to temporary amnesia.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
He has now taken some cotton and a bottle of antiseptic out of the medical bag, and is swabbing her wound.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So all we know is that she was coshed on the head, dumped into the Thames, and subsequently dumped into our laps.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We know a lot more than that. From her accent, we know she is foreign -- from her ring, we know she is married -- and there is one other clue we have... Something I deduced while I was helping her up the stairs. No corset.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
He glances down at Gabrielle's shoe, which has slipped off her foot. Inside, slightly worn away, are the words: LA FEMME ELEGANTE.

Holmes reaches behind her, turns back the collar of her dress. Sewn inside is a label reading: BAZAAR MODERN, Bruxelles.

Mrs. Hudson has come in with a loaded tea-tray, starts to put it down on the table.

<MRS_HUDSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, dash. Will someone remove the violin, please?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_HUDSON>
<DIRECTION>
Watson takes the violin off the table, and she sets down the tray.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We just found out that she's Belgian.

He slips the wedding ring off her finger, picks up a magnifying glass, examines it. It is made of copper, and engraved on the inside is the inscription: Gabrielle - Emile.

	Mrs. Hudson, put her to bed. My bed.

She puts her arm around Gabrielle, who is still crying, leads her into Watson's bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd better mix her a sleeping potion.

</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
He gets a packet of white powder out of his medical bag, and during the following, stirs a spoonful into her tea- cup.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watson, I think we should arrange to have her removed to a hospital.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Under no circumstances.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She should have medical attention.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She can get that from me. But more importantly, she must be protected -- there has already been one attempt on her life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This temporary amnesia -- how temporary is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It depends on the extent of the injury. It's like veils shrouding her memory. It could clear up in a few days -- or a few weeks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watson, this is a very small flat -- we don't want to clutter it up with women...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holmes, we've never had a case like this. A woman comes to us with a problem -- we don't know who the woman is -- and we don't know what the problem is. Don't you find that challenging?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quite. But we can't afford to wait for those veils to lift -- we must break through them as quickly as possible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You really feel it's that urgent?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do. The sooner we solve the case, the sooner we can get rid of her.

The street lamps are still lit. A policeman, on patrol duty, is strolling along the sidewalk, swinging his truncheon. Suddenly he sees something up ahead. Alarmed, he ducks into the doorway of a building, flattens himself against the door.

From the opposite direction comes a horse-drawn water- sprinkling wagon. The spray covers the sidewalks as well as the street.

As she extends her right hand to him, in a beckoning gesture, Holmes notices something on the palm. He takes her hand in his. There, in the same green ink as the smudges on the cardboard, are what appear the be the letters "I", "O", and Greek "E". Crossing to the wash- stand, he picks up his magnifying shaving mirror, returns to the bed, holds it up against the palm of Gabrielle's hand.

</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Remember that piece of soggy cardboard with our address on it? It was a luggage ticket -- the number rubbed off on her hand. And since she must have arrived from Brussels by the boat train, I concluded that she had checked her belongings at Victoria Station.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By Jove! If you're right, we should find a clue to her identity.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes has now forced open the locks.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or at least a pink negligee with maribou feathers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
He opens the suitcase, lifts out the top piece of clothing, holds it up -- a pink negligee with maribou feathers.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Voila!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's see - what else is in here?

</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
They start sorting through the clothes in the suitcase. Holmes removes a tied bundle of letters.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now we're getting somewhere.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
As he examines the envelope, Watson takes out a framed photo of a rather attractive man of fifty.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who do you suppose this is?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
Gabrielle appears from Holmes' bedroom wearing Holmes' dressing gown. She is unsteady on her feet and somewhat dazed. Holmes looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come in, Madame Valladon.

<GABRIELLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.

Her eyes fall on the open suitcase.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Which of you is Mr. Holmes and which is Dr. Watson?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIELLE>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Watson is the handsome one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Watson, pleased, twirls the end of his mustache. Gabrielle sways slightly.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the way he affects most women.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
He helps her into a chair.

</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
He hurries over to the breakfast table.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIELLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all so confusing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIELLE>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's try to sort it out. You came to London looking for your husband...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<GABRIELLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. He's a mining engineer. We were married five years ago, in the Congo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIELLE>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where your husband was working in a copper mine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<GABRIELLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did you know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIELLE>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your wedding ring -- it's made of copper.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
He picks it up from the chemistry table, hands it to her. Gabrielle starts to put it on.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIELLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Last year he invented a new kind of air pump, and was hired by an English company, Jonah Limited.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIELLE>
<WATSON>

(handing her cup of of coffee)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here you are.

</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jonah Limited. Go on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<GABRIELLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've been writing to each other regularly. Then suddenly, three weeks ago, his letters stopped. I kept writing ... but no answer. Finally I decided to go to that address --
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIELLE>
<DIRECTION>
She indicates the bundle of letters. Holmes glances at the return address on the back of the envelope.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	32 Ashdown Street.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<GABRIELLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. It's just an empty store -- nobody there. Then I tried to find Jonah Limited. No such company exists.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIELLE>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How decidedly odd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Madame Valladon, can you think of any reason why your husband should have lied to you about theses things?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<GABRIELLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Emile? Never. He loves me -- and I love him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIELLE>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So I gathered.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<GABRIELLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I went to the police -- they said they would send out a missing persons report -- but they didn't sound too encouraging. Then I went to the Belgian embassy and explained the situation to them -- and they suggested that I consult you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIELLE>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You could have done worse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<GABRIELLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was on my way here -- and suddenly there were footsteps behind me -- and a hand over my mouth -- and the smell of choloroform -- and the next thing I knew I was in the water -- and then a man was wrapping me in a blanket --
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIELLE>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Madame Valladon, somebody tried to kill you last night. Do you have any idea who could have done it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<GABRIELLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't understand any of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(rises, goes to Holmes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What does it all mean, Mr. Holmes? Where is my husband? You must help me find him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIELLE>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll do our best, I assure you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Madame Valladon, I want you to send one more letter to your husband.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
He crosses to the desk, picks up a sheet of paper and an envelope, then leads Gabrielle over to the chair with the writing arm, seats her in it.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To Emile Valladon -- Ashdown Street -- what was that number?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<GABRIELLE>
<DIRECTION>
(addressing envelope)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	32. What do you want me to say in the letter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIELLE>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
He folds the blank sheet of paper, and as Gabrielle finishes addressing the envelope, he inserts the paper in it, starts to seal it.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're sending an empty sheet of paper to an empty shop?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That empty shop is obviously being used as an accomodation address, or letter- drop. But what gets dropped must be picked up. The question is how? -- and by whom? -- and why?

EXT. ASHDOWN STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is a run-down district in the northwestern part of London. On the corner is No. 32 -- a dilapidated abandoned shop, with windows painted halfway up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As CAMERA APPROACHES the building, we hear sawing from inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EMPTY SHOP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is dusty, cobwebby, quite forbidding. In the rear wall is a closed sliding door, indented about a foot into the shop. Nearby stands a large, square object, covered with a tarpaulin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
High up in the rear wall is a slanted skylight, fitted with an iron grill. From outside, Holmes, in deerstalker and Inverness, can be seen sawing through the iron bars. Watson and Gabrielle are beside him.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hammer... Chisel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Watson hands him the indicated tools. Holmes chips away the cement from the top and bottom of the last bar, then using it as a hinge, swings the grill open. He lets himself through the skylight, drops to the floor. Watson now helps Gabrielle through the skylight, lowers her toward Holmes, who puts his arms around her waist, eases her to the floor. For a brief moment he keeps his arms around her. Watson has now squeezed through the skylight.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
He hands the tools to Holmes, jumps to the floor. Gabrielle is looking around the shop.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIELLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's so strange to think I've been writing to a place like this all these months.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIELLE>
<DIRECTION>
Watson crosses to the square tarpaulin-covered object. He lifts up one corner of the tarp -- and is greeted by a loud twittering of birds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
What he has uncovered is a large cage -- and about a hundred canaries, suddenly disturbed, are flapping around unside.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at all these canaries. Do you suppose this could have been a pet shop?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing off)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here comes our letter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Through the front window, the silhouette of a postman can be seen approaching. He drops a letter through the slot in the front door, moves on. The letter lands on a section of floor which is solidly covered with dust -- except for a series of double tracks, running to the door and curving back.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now we are faced with the most nerve- wracking part of the detective's job -- doing nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
He reassembles the three tools, fitting each section into another, to form a cane.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIELLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Holmes --
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIELLE>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<GABRIELLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know how I'm going to pay you for all this. The purse with my money is somewhere at the bottom of the Thames.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIELLE>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It could be worse. You could be at the bottom of the Thames -- much to your discomfort -- and much to my chagrin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't understand how anybody picks up letters here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No footprints -- just tracks. What does it mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would surmise somebody is using ice- skates -- if it weren't for a conspicuous absence of ice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
They become aware of a squeaking noise outside the rear of the shop, growing louder as it gets nearer. The noise stops, there is the sound of a lock turning, then the rattle of a chain.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
(in a frantic whisper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do we do now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
(unfazed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
He leads Gabrielle and Watson toward the rear wall, right next to the door. They flatten themselves with their backs to the wall, just as the door slides open -- concealing them from view.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Revealed is the mews behind the shop. In the door is an old BIDDY with straggly hair, sitting in a wheelchair. In her lap are a bulky paper bag and a tin pitcher filled with water. As she wheels herself inside, the unoiled wheelchair squeaks loudly. She stops in front of the cage, pulls on a rope which runs through a pulley in the ceiling -- and the tarpaulin rises into the air, exposing the canaries.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Good morning, my pretties. Here's Mum with your breakfast. Did you think I'd forgotten you?

</WOMAN_IN_WHEELCHAIR>
<DIRECTION>
She pours grain from the paper bag into a feeder hanging inside the cage, pours water from the pitcher into a trough.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN_IN_WHEELCHAIR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some of you will be going on a little trip soon -- I hate to lose you -- but even an old woman has to live. Although you might well ask, why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN_IN_WHEELCHAIR>

She cackles to herself, glances toward the front door.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN_IN_WHEELCHAIR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. You never told me we had a letter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN_IN_WHEELCHAIR>
<DIRECTION>
She starts to wheel herself toward the front of the shop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through a crack in the door behind which our three are hiding, we see Holmes' eye watching her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The old woman reaches the letter, picks it up, studies the address. Then she hears something, glances toward the open rear door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A horse-drawn wagon with a canvas top is just pulling into the mews. Two CARTERS jump down from the driver's seat, and one of them takes a small bird-cage from the back of the wagon. As they start in through the door, the old woman drops the letter into her lap, wheels herself toward them.

He opens the door of the small cage, the bottom of which is covered with newspaper, starts transferring canaries into it from the large cage.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN_IN_WHEELCHAIR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are they doing with all those canaries? What's going on up there?
	</DIALOGUE>

	Look, Duchess, we don't know -- and we don't want to know.

	<DIALOGUE>
	When you work for Jonah, it's better not to ask questions.

</FIRST_CARTER>
<DIRECTION>
Through the crack in the door behind which he is hidden, we see Holmes' eye studying the small bird cage, as the canaries are being transferred into it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We MOVE IN CLOSE on the small cage, and see the soiled newspaper spread on the bottom. The masthead reads: INVERNESS COURIER.
</DIRECTION>
<FIRST_CARTER>

(counting as he transfers canaries)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty- four.

<DIRECTION>
He closes the doors of the cages, picks up the small cage. His companion indicates the letter in the woman's lap.
</DIRECTION>
<SECOND_CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about that letter? Does that go, too?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECOND_CARTER>
<WOMAN_IN_WHEELCHAIR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. That's going to be picked up in person.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN_IN_WHEELCHAIR>
<DIRECTION>
She chuckles. The carriers exit into the mews, stash the cage in the back of the wagon, mount the driver's seat.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN_IN_WHEELCHAIR>

(to birds)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, my pretties. Back to sleep you go. See you tomorrow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN_IN_WHEELCHAIR>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls the rope and the tarpaulin drops back over the cage. Then she deposits the letter on top of the covered cage, wheels herself out the rear door. As she slides it shut from outside, our trio is revealed in their hiding places behind the door. There is the sound of the chain rattling, the lock snapping, and the squeaky wheels moving off.

They step forward, and through the painted shop window watch the old woman wheel herself down the street.

	Did you hear what she said? You really think Emile is going to pick up the letter himself?

Gabrielle glances casually at the letter the old woman left lying on top of the cage, and her expression changes.

	Nevertheless --

With the saw-end of his cane, he slits the envelope open, removes the enclosure, unfolds it. We see the letter in his hand as he reads it out loud. The letterhead says: DIOGENES CLUB, St. James's, London.

A dozen elderly Establishment types are sunk deep in the leather armchairs, buried behind their copies of The Times. Holmes and Watson are proceeding toward the study. Suddenly Holmes stops beside one of the old fossils, who has fallen asleep in his chair, The Times in his lap, and between his fingers a lighted cigar with an ash four inches long. Holmes picks up an ashtray, holds it under the cigar -- just in time to catch the falling ash. As he replaces the ashtray, he scrutinizes the ash.

MYCROFT HOLMES is standing at a refectory table, with his back to the door, engaged in a curious operation. A dusty bottle of wine is held in an ingeniously engineered cradle. As he turns the crank, the bottle tilts forward gently, and he decants the wine into three glasses without disturbing the sediment.

Mycroft is an impressive figure of a man, seven years older than Sherlock, impeccably dressed. Behind his snobbish airs and bantering manner, one senses tremendous reserves of strength and authority.

</HOLMES>
<MYCROFT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Under control. Except for the occasional twinge.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MYCROFT>
<DIRECTION>
He brings over two of the glasses of wine to Holmes and Watson.
</DIRECTION>
<MYCROFT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have a treat for you -- a very old Madeira -- 1814. There are only six bottles left in the world. I have two of them, and am negotiating for a third.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MYCROFT>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you don't mind my saying so, anybody who's susceptible to gout shouldn't be --
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
Mycroft has moved back to the table and picked up his glass of Madeira.
</DIRECTION>
<MYCROFT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The last doctor who warned me about that was crossing Piccadilly, slipped on an orange peel, and was run over by a delivery van from the Fortnum and Mason. Your very good health.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MYCROFT>
<DIRECTION>
He and Watson sip their drinks, but not Holmes.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are you wasting this precious stuff on us?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<MYCROFT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I see you so rarely. How long has it been? Not since the case of the Greek interpreter.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Watson)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Isn't it ridiculous? Two brothers living in the same town...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MYCROFT>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In the same town, perhaps -- but not the same world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
(taking another sip)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mmmm. Superb. How old did you say it was?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<MYCROFT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	1814. One year before Waterloo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MYCROFT>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One year before Waterloo? Think of that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<MYCROFT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You do know where Waterloo is, don't you, Doctor?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MYCROFT>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Belgium, isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<MYCROFT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quite.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turning to Holmes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And speaking of Belgium, it has come to my attention that you are interested in the whereabouts of a certain engineer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MYCROFT>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<MYCROFT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I can save you a lot of trouble.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MYCROFT>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd be grateful for any suggestion --
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<MYCROFT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My suggestion is that you pursue it no further.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MYCROFT>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Any particular reason?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<MYCROFT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because it involves the national security. We are handling this matter ourselves.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MYCROFT>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We? Who's we?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Diogenes Club, of course.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<MYCROFT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't say that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MYCROFT>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have always suspected that there was some underground connection between this stodgy and seemingly calcified establishment and the Foreign Office in Whitehall.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<MYCROFT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's neither here nor there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MYCROFT>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It seems to me that The Diogenes Club is here, there and everywhere. When there are rumblings of revolt in the Sudan, an expedition subsidized by your club conveniently shows up to study the source of the Nile. When there is trouble along the Indian frontier, some of your fellow members pop up in the Himalayas, alledgedly looking for the Abominable Snowman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
A YOUNG MAN in morning coat and striped trousers comes in, holding a telegram. Mycroft crosses to him.
</DIRECTION>
<MYCROFT>
<DIRECTION>
(to Watson)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What a fertile imagination my brother has. At the age of five, by carefully observing a neighbor's house, he deduced that babies were brought not by the stork, but by the mid-wife in her satchel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MYCROFT>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As good an explanation as any.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
Mycroft has taken the telegram, and is coming forward with it. The young man clears his throat.
</DIRECTION>
<MYCROFT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Wiggins?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MYCROFT>
<YOUNG_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	An immediate answer is requested, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Mycroft inserts a monocle in his eye, opens the telegram, moves toward the desk reading it.
</DIRECTION>
<MYCROFT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell them that the three boxes go to Glennahurich, and the red runner goes to the castle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MYCROFT>
<YOUNG_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The three boxes to Glennahurich, the red runner to the castle. Very good, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
He exits. Holmes glances toward the telegram as Mycroft puts it down on his desk. Catching his look, Mycroft turns his telegram face-down, lets the monocle drop from his eye.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you crumple it up and swallow it -- to make sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<MYCROFT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My dear Sherlock, there are certain affairs that do not come within the province of the private detective. They have to be dealt with on an altogether different level.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MYCROFT>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In other words, you want me to stay within my limits.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<MYCROFT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do indeed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MYCROFT>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Speaking of limits, what exactly is Jonah Limited?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<MYCROFT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sherlock, when I said drop this case, it was not merely a suggestion -- it was an order!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MYCROFT>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By whose authority?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<MYCROFT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By the authority of Her Majesty's government. I hope I've made myself clear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MYCROFT>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perfectly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
In his nervousness he drops his bowler, which rolls along the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<MYCROFT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now if you'll excuse me, gentlemen --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MYCROFT>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goodbye, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A pleasure, as always.

He and Watson retrieve their hats, move toward the door.

	Just a minute.

(picks up Holmes' cane)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You forgot your tool-kit.

He tosses the cane to Holmes, who catches it.

EXT. BAKER STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes and Watson are walking toward 221B. Holmes is whistling 'Loch Lomond.'
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You will be gentle, won't you, when you tell her you're dropping the case?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watson, what does the word Glennahurich suggest to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Absolutely nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's Scottish.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And like all Scottish names, it's really a word picture. Glen means valley, na means of the, and Hurich, if memory serves me, means yew tree.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're just trying to impress me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So the three boxes go to the Valley of the Yew Tree.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
He resumes whistling. They start to cross the street, skirting a parked hansom. Feeding the horse is the same cabbie who fished Gabrielle out of the river, and in the passenger seat is Von Tirpitz, the craggy-faced Prussian we saw before. He stares fixedly after Holmes and Watson.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes and Watson come up to the door of 221B, and Watson fishes his key out. Holmes is still whistling.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
(singing along)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I'll be in Scotland before ye...

<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Open the door.

Watson turns the key in the lock, starts to open the door, but is stopped by a chain on the inside. Through the opening a revolver appears, aiming at them point- blank.

Mrs. Hudson withdraws the gun, unhooks the chain. She is also holding an embroidery hoop. She opens the door, and Holmes and Watson step into the vestibule.

<MRS_HUDSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, at last. It's been a ghastly experience.

</MRS_HUDSON>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why? What happened?

</WATSON>
<MRS_HUDSON>

<DIRECTION>
(taking gun from her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll be relieved to know it was not loaded.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
He starts up the stairs, followed by Watson.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holmes, you didn't answer my question. Are you planning to disobey Mycroft's orders? He's not just your brother, you know. You'd be defying Her Majesty's government...

</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
No reaction from Holmes. As they reach the landing, Gabrielle is waiting for them in the open doorway of their flat.

	Yes, my dear. But circumstances have changed --

	<DIALOGUE>
	The great detective! Well, maybe this case is too small for you --

	On the contrary. It's being handled at a much higher level --
	</DIALOGUE>

(looking up from railway guide)
</DIRECTION>

Holmes replaces the railway guide on the shelf.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holmes, what exactly are you up to?

</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As you like to put it in your chronicles, the game is afoot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But what game? Are you really that interested in the Belgian engineer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
Without answering, Holmes heads for his bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or the wife of the Belgian engineer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes, by this time in his bedroom, shuts the door. Gabrielle reappears from the other bedroom, carrying a glove.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIELLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't like me very much, do you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIELLE>
<DIRECTION>
She moves toward the couch.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing of the sort. Quite the opposite... But there's more to this case than meets the eye --
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
By this time Gabrielle has picked up her parasol from the couch, and is obviously searching about.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looking for something?

</WATSON>
<GABRIELLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My other glove.

He comes up from under the couch with the missing glove.

Through the upstairs window of 221B we see Gabrielle shutting the parasol. CAMERA PULLS BACK TO INCLUDE the hansom parked across the street, and von Tirpitz watching. He signals to the cabbie, who is back on his perch. The cabbie flicks his whip, and the hansom takes off down the street.

The upper and lower berths have been made up in the small, gaslit compartment. Gabrielle's dress is on a hanger, but there is no sign of her at the moment. Holmes is just pulling a night-shirt over his head.

<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right. You can look now.

Gabrielle's head appears from under the covers of the lower berth.

<GABRIELLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Am I embarrassing you, Mr. Holmes?

There is the normal complement of passengers, men, women and children, of the middle and lower classes. The only unusual occupants are a group of seven MONKS, in brown habits and cowls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watson, in valet's livery, comes down the aisle, proceeds toward a window-seat where he has left his umbrella and bowler. The resf of the bench is occupied by monks, as is the facing bench. As Watson tries to squeeze between them, he steps on the foot of one of the monks.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, father -- I mean, friar -- or is it abbot?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
There is no answer from the monk. Watson picks up his bowler, settles himself in his seat, starts to fan himself with his hat. He turns sociably to the monk beside him, who is absorbed in his Bible.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Going to Scotland, you gentlemen? So are we...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>

As he fans himself the ear-pieces of his stethoscope, which is coiled inside the crown of his bowler, dangle down. He quickly shoves them back inside.

<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a valet. My master and mistress and I are our way to Inverness. Ever been there? Beautiful country.

</WATSON>

The monk looks up from his Bible, points to his lips, shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, forgive me. You must be one of those orders that's taken the vow of silence. Trappists, I believe you're called.

The monk doesn't answer. Watson turns away, looks out the window -- but there's nothing to be seen. Then he folds, bored. He glances casually at the Bible in the monk's hands.

Under a leaden sky, the yew trees which give the place its name brood over ancient gravestones.

<DIRECTION>
Holmes, Gabrielle and Watson come down an overgrown path, stop and look off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A rather meagre funeral procession is moving along the avenue which runs between the rows of graves. It consists of one normal-size pine coffin and two smaller ones, loaded on a cart which is being wheeled by a couple of workmen. Bringing up behind is a MINISTER, with an open prayer book in his hands.

They are about to get under way when suddenly Holmes stops them.

Coming down the avenue toward them are four small boys, in knickerbockers and caps, carrying bouquets of flowers.

Without a word, Holmes draws Gabrielle and Watson back to their hiding place, behind the headstone.

The four boys approach the freshly-filled graves. They remove their caps, lay their flowers on each of the two small graves, then kneel down and bow their heads in prayer.

From their position behind the headstone, Holmes, Watson and Gabrielle are watching the four boys, who have their backs to them.

	If they're unidentified graves, why are those boys bringing flowers?

He picks some up from the ground, hands them to Holmes, who tosses them in the direction of the graves. The pebbles strike a granite cross. At the sound, the four boys simultaneously turn their heads over their shoulders. Despite their slight bodies they have the features of mature men.

Kneeling beside the grave, watching anxiously, are Gabrielle and Watson, the latter holding a bullseye lantern.

Holmes pries the lid open, disclosing the corpse of a middle-aged man. His arms are folded across his chest, and on the third finger of his left hand is a wedding ring similar to Gabrielle's. From the picture of him we have seen earlier, we recognize the face as that of Emile Valladon.

EXT. URQUHART CASTLE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On a promontory jutting into Loch Ness stand the remains of a medieval fortress. Around the Tower, the Motte, and the ruins of the East wall, wooden scaffolding has been erected, and a couple of dozen men are engaged in what appears to be repair work. Amidst the rubble of the Nether Bailey, an encampment of tents has been set up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes, Gabrielle and Watson come bicycling up along a fence on the heights overlooking the castle, dismount in front of the locked gates. Attached to the gatepost is a sign reading: WARNING: No Unauthorized Person Permitted Beyond This Point.

	Well, I don't think we have to bother with this castle. It's just a pile of rubble.

Watson and Gabrielle follow his gaze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the back of the wagon, the carriers have removed the small bird-cage we saw in the mail-drop on Ashdown Street. They hand it to a workman, who starts up the steps with it. To another couple of workmen they pass down an open-sided crate in which rest two heavy glass bottles protected by wicker. Stencilled on the wooden slate of the crate are the words: SULPHURIC ACID - CORROSIVE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes is watching thoughtfully, Gabrielle and Watson are puzzled.

<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sulphuric acid?

	The more we find out the less sense it makes.

Watson has lowered his clasped hands, and Holmes uses them as a foothold to go scrambling up the scaffolding of the nearby wall. Reaching the top, he looks off in the direction of the tower.

The workman carrying the canary cage, and the two carrying the crate of sulphuric acid are approaching the tower. A draw-bridge comes down, and the three men cross the moat and enter the tower.

EXT. LOCH NESS - EARLY EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sun has just gone down behind the hills, but there is still light in the sky. An ominous mist is beginning to settle on the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gabrielle is sitting in the stern of a rowboat, her parasol in her lap. She is wearing Holmes' Norfolk jacket over her dress to ward off the chill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the rowing seat, facing her, are Watson and Holmes, the latter in his waistcoat. Their oars are pulled in, and they are watching Urquhart Castle, on the opposite side of the lake.

</GABRIELLE>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes and Watson turn their heads.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
About half a mile away, moving in and out of patches of drifting mist, is Watson's monster, its long reptillian neck cutting through the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watson leaps to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holmes!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>

Holmes grabs his arm, pulls him back into his seat.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quick, Watson. After it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs his oar, and Watson belatedly joins in. They strain at the oars, setting a course which will intercept the monster. Gabrielle leans forward in her seat, trying to peer past them through the curtains of mist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The monster is much closer now -- no more than a quarter of a mile away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Watson stops rowing.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holmes, what are we doing? We should be going away from it.

</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep rowing, dammit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Watson resumes pulling on his oar. As they row, Holmes looks over his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The monster has started to submerge. Its head disappears beneath the surface of the water, and the wake it leaves behind soon trails off into the mist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes ships his oar.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've lost it.

</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quiet.

</HOLMES>

He listens intently. There is only the sound of water slapping against the side of the boat. The mist is heavier now, and billowing around them.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never without it.

He removes his bowler, unwinds the stethoscope from the inside the crown, hands it to Holmes. Holmes plugs in the ear-pieces, leans over the side of the boat, extends the other end of the stethoscope to the surface of the water.

</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's getting closer -- closer --
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the surface of the water breaks, about twenty yards away from them, and the head and neck of the monster rear up from the depths. Watson is first to notice it and jumps to his feet, making choking noises. Gabrielle sees it and screams. Watson grabs an oar, throws it at the monster as it comes past. The backwash hits the boat broadside, rocking it, and Holmes, Watson and Gabrielle are spilled into the lake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The monster moves away from them, heading in the general direction of the castle. It disappears into the mist.

<DIRECTION>
Holmes is the first to come up, looks around, sees Gabrielle surfacing a few yards away, swims to her.

As Gabrielle hoists herself into the boat, Watson clambers over the other side. After a moment Holmes joins them, and they sit there, sopping wet and breathing heavily.

Holmes, in a different suit of clothes, is pacing across the room, whistling the main theme from "Swan Lake." He stops before the open French window, gazes out toward the lake. Gabrielle is propped up in bed, a blanket drawn up to her chin, watching him. Watson, who has changed into a pair of kilts, is standing in front of the fireplace, warming his backside.

The man moves off toward the tower. Mycroft pulls back the flap of the tent.

Holmes passes inside, Mycroft following.

INT. TENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is lit by a kerosene lamp suspended from the ridge- pole. There are several cots, one of them with the bedding rolled up. Resting on the stripped cot is a trunk with the name E. VALLADON painted on it. Lying on a table, among a group of engineering models, are Gabrielle's parasol and Watson's stethoscope. There are also a couple of drafting tables, with plans and blueprints tacked to them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes moves around the tent, taking all this in.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Interesting -- and educational.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<MYCROFT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Despite my most emphatic warning, you persisted in meddling. It would have served you right if you'd all drowned.

	I imagine this belongs to the pretty lady, and this belongs to your valet... We found them floating in the lake.

</MYCROFT>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Speaking about things floating in the lake --
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<MYCROFT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How much do you know -- or think you know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MYCROFT>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you're testing some sort of underwater craft -- camouflauged to mislead the gullible. I think it's an experimental model, operated by a crew of midgets. I think it is powered by sulphuric acid batteries, and uses canaries to detect escaping gas... Altogether a strange contraption.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<MYCROFT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not quite that unique. Right now, four countries are trying to develop what we call a submersible. But none of them could solve the critical problem -- how to stay submerged long enough to make it effective.
	</DIALOGUE>

<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What does the Good Book say? "And Jonah lived in the belly of that fish for three days and three nights."
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<MYCROFT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was our goal. And thanks to Valladon's air-pump, we got a jump on the rest of them. It's a highly complex system of filtration -- so we had a series of trials --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MYCROFT>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And at least one error.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<MYCROFT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	During a test run in Moray Firth, pressure caused a leak in the hull. Sea water mixed with the acid in the batteries to produce chlorine gas. Before they could reach the surface, Valladon and the crew were dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MYCROFT>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you had them buried in unmarked graves, to preserve your secret.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<MYCROFT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was essential to keep the information from your client.
	</DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	You went to all those lengths to prevent Madame Valladon from fiding her husband?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<MYCROFT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your client isn't Madame Valladon -- it's the Imperial German Government. They were after the Belgian engineer -- or rather, his invention. They knew he was employed by us, but they couldn't find out where -- so they enlisted the best brain in England to help them. You, my dear brother, have been working for the Wilhelmstrasse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MYCROFT>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And Madame Valladon -- what part did she play in all this?

He hands Holmes a small, framed photograph. Holmes looks at it with apprehension, as well he should: the picture is of a somewhat matronly woman, not the glamorous Gabrielle. Holmes lowers the photograph. Behind it, Mycroft is glaring at him with customary arrogance.

<MYCROFT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The woman who was brought to your house in the middle of the night -- apparently fished out of the Thames -- and apparently suffering from amnesia -- is, in fact, Ilse von Hoffmanstal, one of their most skillful agents. Am I going too fast for one of the "best brains in England?"
	</DIALOGUE>
</MYCROFT>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go on.

</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
As Mycroft continues, Holmes picks up Ilse's water-soaked parasol and examines it.
</DIRECTION>
<MYCROFT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They planted her on you quite neatly, I must admit, so that you could lead them to their objective, the air pump. Very much like using a hog to find truffles. And now perhaps you'd care to join me. I am expecting a certain royal personage from Balmoral.

EXT. CASTLE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A coach and escort approach the castle. Painted on the door of the coach are the initials "V.R."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CASTLE COURTYARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The entourage enters the castle courtyard and stops. Footmen open the door and bow to the lone passenger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Waiting on top of the steps, outside the tent, are Mycroft and Holmes. Lined up on the other side of the torch-lit red carpet are half a dozen scientists, in their best clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Out of the coach steps a familiar figure -- Her Majesty, QUEEN VICTORIA, Defender of the Faith, Empress of India. She is 69 years old, and dressed entirely in black.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mycroft comes down the carpeted steps to meet her.
</DIRECTION>
<MYCROFT>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, let us get on with it, gentlemen.

</QUEEN_VICTORIA>
<DIRECTION>
Mycroft leads the Queen along the red runner toward the tower. Holmes follows, then the lady-in-waiting and the equerry, then the scientists.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they cross the inner courtyard, the Highland piper falls in ahead of the procession, leads them toward the drawbridge. Then he steps aside, as the royal party crosses the drawbridge and passes through the door of the tower.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DUNGEON - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A high-ceilinged rock chamber, with a spiral iron staircase leading down. The floor is a concrete ramp, the lower end of it covered with water. Beyond is the entrance from the Loch, camouflaged by scaffolding and vegetation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the upper part of the ramp is a small, primitive submarine, resting on wheels. Prominently lettered on the bow is the name H.M.S. JONAH, and suspended by a rope from the prow is the magnum of champagne which Holmes delivered. Along the sides are torpedo tubes, and fitted over the conning tower is the head and neck of the "monster" we saw in the lake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Present are half a dozen naval personnel, commanded by an officer. As the royal party comes down the spiral staircase, the officer snaps to attention. Mycroft is in the lead, followed by the Queen, Holmes, the lady-in- waiting, the equerry and the scientists.
</DIRECTION>
<MYCROFT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There she, Ma'am. Her Majesty's Ship Jonah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MYCROFT>
<DIRECTION>
The four surviving midgets appear on the deck, in wool jerseys and navy caps. They start pulling on a chain which slowly raises the detachable head-and-neck of the monster toward the ceiling, disclosing the conning tower and the periscope.
</DIRECTION>
<QUEEN_VICTORIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what, may we ask, is the purpose of that hideous gargoyle?
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUEEN_VICTORIA>
<MYCROFT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's merely a decoy, Ma'am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MYCROFT>
<QUEEN_VICTORIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. To frighten away the sharks, we imagine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUEEN_VICTORIA>
<MYCROFT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something of the sort... The crew will now demonstrate the workings of the submersible.

A SAILOR of normal height appears on the deck of the sub.
</DIRECTION>
<SAILOR>

</SAILOR>
<DIRECTION>
The midgets scramble down the hatch.
</DIRECTION>
<QUEEN_VICTORIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aren't they rather small for sailors?
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUEEN_VICTORIA>
<MYCROFT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They are. But because of the size of the craft, the Navy made an exception.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MYCROFT>
<QUEEN_VICTORIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They should make it a rule. It's quite fatiguing to pin on all those medals while standing on our toes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUEEN_VICTORIA>
<DIRECTION>
There is the sound of the engines starting. Mycroft leads the Queen to an open bulkhead in the side of the sub, with Holmes and rest of the party close behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside, all is noise and confusion. Metal rods are dipping into glass jars of sulphuric acid, complicated machinery is driving the propeller shaft, bellows are inflating and deflating, etc. The midgets are at their stations in the cramped quarters, pulling switches, oiling the engines, operating the periscope. Overhead is a cageful of canaries, all chirping away. Mycroft points out the various features to the Queen.
</DIRECTION>
<MYCROFT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the main engine, which propels it under water at the rate of two knots -- the stabilizing mechanism -- the multi- stage compressor -- the ballast tank trimmer -- the air-pump which filters and recirculates the air --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MYCROFT>
<QUEEN_VICTORIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How charming.
	</DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	The canaries. Must make the crew feel at home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUEEN_VICTORIA>
<MYCROFT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Ma'am. These are the levers for firing the torpedoes, which are accurate up to as much as 120 feet -- the periscope for scanning the surface of the water --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MYCROFT>
<QUEEN_VICTORIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But where is the glass bottom?

</QUEEN_VICTORIA>
<MYCROFT>

	Nonsense. We refuse to believe that our grandson Willie would do a thing like that.

As Holmes continues opening and closing the parasol, Gabrielle gets out of bed, comes up beside him. Holmes finishes the message, shuts the parasol, draws it back into the room. Then he looks out the window.

	Well, it's up to the good monks now. You can consider your part of the mission accomplished, Fraulein Hoffmanstal.

	You're all wrong about me. My name isn't Hoffmanstal.

	I suppose once they're in the castle... It must amuse you, Mr. Holmes, Trappists walking into a trap.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIELLE>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's more amusing than that. Once in the castle, they will encounter surprisingly little resistance -- it will take but a small bottle of chloroform to overcome the guards.

	You mean you're going to let them have the air-pump?

<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Better than that. We're going to let them have the submersible. They will find it with its engines running, all set to go. I assume they're all expert sailors? And since there is a German battleship cruising off the coast of Scotland, I expect they'll try to sail it out of the lock and rendezvous at sea.

	Did you say try to?

Bright sunlight now floods the room. Gabrielle, fully dressed, is standing in front of the mirror, putting on her hat. Her packed bag has been set out in the middle of the room, and resting on it is the parasol.

The door bursts open and Watson dashes in.

The aide joins the coachman, and the carriage drives off. Gabrielle does not look back toward the hotel.

INT. LIVING ROOM - 221B BAKER STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes, in his dressing gown, and Watson, in his smoking jacket, are at the breakfast table. There is snow on the window-sills, and a cozy fire is burning in the grate. Watson is reading the morning paper. Holmes is sorting through his mail.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>

(holding up envelope)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	H'mmm. A letter from the Diogenes Club.

	Maybe Mycroft is putting you up for membership.

</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If only to have the distinct pleasure of blackballing his brother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
He has slit open the envelope. Watson watches him curiously as he reads the letter, but Holmes' face remains expressionless. Slowly he puts down the letter, rises, crosses to the window, stands there staring out into the wintry street.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aren't you going to finish your breakfast?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes doesn't answer. Watson takes a lump of sugar out of the bowl with a pair of tongs, drops it into his coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then glancing over his shoulder to make sure Holmes isn't watching, he swivels the letter around with the tongs. It is written on Diogenes Club stationery, and reads:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
9th December, 1888. Dear Sherlock, My sources in Tokyo inform me that Ilse von Hoffmanstal was arrested last week by the Japanese counter-intelligence service for spying on naval installations in Yokohama harbour. After a secret trial, she was summarily executed by a firing squad.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It might interest you to know that...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The page ends at this point. Watson turns the sheet of paper over with the tongs. The letter continues on the other side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...she had been living in Japan these past few months under the name of Mrs. Ashdown.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sincerely,

<DIRECTION>
Mycroft.

Watson looks toward Holmes, who is still standing with his back to the room, gets up from the table.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holmes -- I'm terribly sorry about this.

</WATSON>

(after a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In the files. May to July, 1885.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes turns to the bookshelves above the desk. From a row of similar volumes, he slides out the three files marked MAY, JUNE, and JULY 1885. Actually, it's the medical bag, standing on end, with the spines of three volumes pasted on the bottom.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're getting better.

He sets the bag down on the desk, opens it, takes out a bottle of cocaine. Watson watches him with compassion as he crosses to his bedroom with his cocaine, goes in, shuts the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Footsteps are heard hurrying up the stairs, and after a moment there is a knock on the door. Watson approaches the door, opens it to reveal INSPECTOR LESTRADE -- a short, nervous man whose features are sharper than his mind. He is wearing an overcoat, his bowler is in his hands, and his fingers are drumming on the crown.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTRADE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good morning, Watson.

	We've had three rather nasty murders in Whitechapel. All ladies of easy virtue. You may read something about it -- the newspapers are referring to the killer as Jack the Ripper.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh... Well, I just thought it was the kind of case that might interest him. I dare say we can solve it without his help.

</LESTRADE>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I'm sure you will.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
From Holmes' bedroom comes the sound of a melancholy tune being played on the violin. Watson starts to ease Lestrade out of the door.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good day, Lestrade.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
He shuts the door after him, listens to the sound of the violin for a moment. Then he crosses to the wicker chair, seats himself. He takes some sheets of paper out of the rack and places them on the writing arm, dips his pen in the inkwell, starts to write.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The violin music continues OVER SCENE, infinitely romantic, infinitely sad.

FADE OUT.
