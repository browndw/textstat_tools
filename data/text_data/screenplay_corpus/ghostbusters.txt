On the farmhouse roof a CHICKEN-SHAPED WEATHERVANE stands silhouetted against a FULL, BLOOD-RED MOON. The wind HOWLS and the vane swivels with an EERIE SQUEAK. Then a weird ANIMAL CRY is heard--a cross between a chicken CROWING and a wolf HOWLING.

In a BUBBLE above him, we see Slimer's DREAM, various kinds of food dancing and SINGING the first two bars of Los Lobos' "LA BAMBA" a la the California Raisins in "I Heard It Through The Grapevine." Still asleep, Slimer licks his lips hungrily, opens his mouth incredibly wide and pounces on the entire dream balloon with a teeth-jarring CHOMP! that POPS the dream bubble so that it EXPLODES inside his mouth, waking him up.
