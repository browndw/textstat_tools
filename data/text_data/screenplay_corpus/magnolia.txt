	<DIALOGUE>
	And you did hear me right. Tame it. Take it on, head first -- with your skills at work and say, "No. You will not control me. You will not take my soul and you will not win this game." 'cause it is a game, guys, you wanna think it's not -- go back to the schoolyard and have a crush on Mary Jane -- respect the cock -- you are embedding this thought: I'm in charge. I'm the one who says yes, no, now or here. Shit, man. Sad but true. Sad But True. And you wanna know what? It must be the way. The thing about chicks and the thing about this course that we're going through today is how universal the whole thing is. I mean: I wish I could sit here and say that it's not -- because the reality? If each chick had something new, something really new that I'd never seen before? Fuckin' hell: I'd be in the money! Because I'd have to create a hundred new cassettes, a hundred new books, a hundred new seminars and hundred new videos just to deal with each and every situation a chick could create - but that is just not the case. They are universal. They are sheep. They are to be studied and watched -- they have patterns that must be stopped, interupted and resisted. I'd be makin' a fuckin' butt load if they were actually as much of a challenge as they want you to think they are! Reality: They Are All The Same. Each and every one of them. And once you learn these methods: You're Set. You Don't Have To Come Back. That's it. In solid. Boom. Done. Over. Why? Because all women are the same. Period. End of discussion. Sorry. It's true. Sad But True. And anyone who wants to say that these methods we work by are "unfair?" Yes, they are. Guilty as charged. And so's the world. It's a harsh, hard unfair place, but it's not gonna stop me from getting my fair shair of hair pie -- Period. Sorry. End of discussion.

And if they think that way -- then they are asking for you to hurt them and That Is What You Must Do. That is what you must do which is punish them many, many times over.

	This is the number for Hospice. Ok. Now. As far as the morphine pills go, there is something else to consider that can take the pain away that he is in, there is a very strong and very potent solution of liquid morphine....it's a little bottle, with an eye dropper and it's easy to get in his mouth and drop on his tounge and it will certainly diminish the pain that he is in but you have to realize that once you give it to him. there really is no coming back, I mean, it will certainly cure his pain, but he will float in and out of consciousness, even worse than he is now, Linda. I mean, any sign of the recognizable Earl will pretty much go away --

I'm talking about eliminating insight and understanding as human values. GOD DAMN I'M GOOD. There is no need for INSIGHT. There is no need for UNDERSTANDING. I have found a way to take any subjective human experience -- in other words -- all the terrible shit or all the great shit that you've had happen to you in your life -- and quickly and easily transform it in the unconscious mind through the subtle and cunning use of language.
