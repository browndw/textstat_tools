A CRYO-LOCKER BLOWS OPEN, spitting out...

CAROLYN FRY. She hits the deck of the main cabin: Four crew lockers in a forward section, countless more in back. But the deck is canted at a sick angle and ALARMS SCREAM everywhere: The world is dying around her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Legs wobbly, shivering like a flu victim, Fry stumbles to the next forward locker. It's riddled with holes. One DEAD CREWIE is seen through fractured plexi, body pocked and bloodied. But in the next cryo-locked...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAPTAIN is struggling awake. Fry's face floods with relief. Slapping an intercom:
</DIRECTION>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hear me? Cap'n? Some kinda compromise to the hull...holding for now, but...Goddamn, I'm glad you're alive. Gotta pull your E-release...no, red handle, red handle. I'll get the warm-ups out while --

PHFUT-PHFUT-PHFUT-PHFUT: Particles bore through the cabin, blasting open the captain's chest, shattering plexi, DETONATING INSTRUMENTS on the opposite wall and leaving CONTRAILS HISSING in the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fry lands on her ass, horrified. Suddenly...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another LOCKER BLOWS OPEN. A body falls right on top of Fry -- but this one's still alive. Disoriented, frantic:

Johns searches for his pistol. Behind him, two chained feet lower into FRAME -- and then attack, swinging over Johns' head... getting the chain on his neck...twisting hard, using the chain as a choke-collar. Johns flicks open a baton, swings it up at...

<DIRECTION>
Riddick. Still in body chains and mouth-bit. Clinging to a ceiling support. Riding out the baton blows.

Seconds from blacking out, Johns strains forward...forward...and finally breaks Riddick's grip on the support. He keeps hold of the chained feet so that...

INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
START on the cutting torch, abandoned in wreckage. Staring at it is...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Riddick. With his hands cuffed behind him and around a bulkhead, he can't get near it. Or can he? Near the ceiling, the bulkhead is fractured -- a slim spot where maybe chains could pass through.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Riddick stands. With a GRUESOME POPPING, he dislocates both shoulders...carries his arms overhead...passes the chains through the broken spot...and brings his arms down in front of him. A body-flex POPS HIS SHOULDERS back into joint.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Free, he reaches for the cutting torch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pistol in hand, Johns runs into a BIG CLOSEUP, eyes sweeping. Nothing on the horizon. But something lies on the ground nearby. It's Riddick's mouth-bit.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like we needed another way to die.

INT. CARGO HOLD - DAY

FAST CLOSEUPS: Hands pillaging storage lockers, pulling out anything that might qualify as a "weapon." It all gets hauled back and dumped into...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NAV BAY - CRASH SHIP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nav-bay. Gathered, the survivors take inventory: Johns has a pistol, shotgun, baton. Zeke and Shazza offer up a pick-ax, digging tools, hunting boomerang. Imam shows a ceremonial blade. Paris straggles in with antique curios.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNS>

	Well, what's the need, anyway? If he's gone, he's gone. Why should he bother us?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARIS>
<JOHNS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First, because he can only live out there for so long -- he's gonna come back and take what we got. Second, for the sheer thrill of the kill.

</JOHNS>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. They all grab for weapons.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Johns stands atop the crash ship, scanning with a scope. He fixates on...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A blue glow on the horizon. "What the hell is it?"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zeke and Shazza modify breather units, adding straps and tubing and ball-floats. The prototype is tested on Audrey. She sucks on the mouthpiece -- and finds that it works, supplying oxygen on demand rather than in a constant flow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chrislams convert to traditional bedouin head-gear, readying for travel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fry finishes wrapping Owens' body. She looks to the yellow sun, low on the horizon. The red sun seems inclined to follow.

EXT. PLANET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trekking, the Chrislams waft incense pots and CHANT FROM THE KORAN as they head toward the blue star. Johns provides shotgun escort; Fry carries Paris' second war-pick on a shoulder. Silhouetted against the alien sky, the scouting party is an odd, odd sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Already sun-battered, Johns crafts an eye-visor out of plexi. Fry tries to wrap her head like the Chrislams. Imam helps.
</DIRECTION>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>

EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paris has taken over as look-out atop the ship. He deals with the heat by erecting a "misting" umbrella: He fills a reservoir with liquor, dials up a regulator. Umbrella spars shoot bursts of cooling alcohol vapor. Paris luxuriates in it.
</DIRECTION>
<ZEKE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Comfy up there?

Zeke appears below. He loads a scrap-metal sled with tarp, cable, pick-ax.
</DIRECTION>
<PARIS>

	Amazing how you can do without the essentials of life -- so long as you have the luxuries.
	</DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, just keep your bloody-fuckin' eyes open. Don't want that ratbag sneakin' up on me bloody-fuckin' arse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZEKE>
<DIRECTION>
He drags the sled toward the spired hills. Keeping one eye on Zeke, Paris eases into a chair, lays the war-pick across his lap, pours himself a spot of sherry. As he sips, a blade touches his throat.
</DIRECTION>
<AUDREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He'd probably get you right here, right under the jaw. And you'd never hear him coming. That's how good Riddick is.

EXT. BONEYARD OVERLOOK - DAY

The scouting party approaches a rise. The trees loom just beyond.
</DIRECTION>
<PILGRIMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Allahu Akbar...Allahu Akbar....
	</DIALOGUE>
</PILGRIMS>
<DIRECTION>
The young pilgrims break into a excited run, anticipating an oasis. But Fry hangs back, taking a harder look at the trees. They don't move in the wind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pilgrims scramble up the rise -- and go motionless. Fry, Johns and Imam catch up to behold...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The "trees" are actually the dorsal bones of a titanic skeleton, tinted green by lichen. Beyond is a sea of bleached animal bones. Impossibly, the bones seem to MOAN IN PAIN. All told, it's like Hell overflowed right here.
</DIRECTION>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this whole planet dead?

<IMAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some...communal graveyard, perhaps... like the elephants of Earth....

Fry touches one of the towering bones. It shows cut-marks -- almost as if the bone was hacked by a sword. "Graveyard? Or killing field?"

	<DIALOGUE>
	Long time ago. Whatever happened.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNS>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pilgrim #1 reaches a huge skull laced with baleen-like combing. Wind hitting the comb makes a LOW HARMONIC MOANING. By moving a hand over the comb, the pilgrim can "play" DIRGELIKE MUSIC. Wanting to show off the trick:
</DIRECTION>
<PILGRIM_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah....
	</DIALOGUE>
</PILGRIM_1>
<DIRECTION>
He looks for Pilgrim #3 but can't spot him. And when he turns back to the skull -- a face is staring through the combing. But it's only...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pilgrim #3, inside the skull. Johns enters and chases him out. About to leave, Johns notices...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bone-chippings piled on the ground. It could be nothing, but still...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Johns double-checks shadows, probing with the muzzle of his shotgun. Satisfied, Johns exits. Now BOOM UP to reveal...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Riddick. Hidden in a sinus cavity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trailing the others, Fry pauses to change out the O2 on her breather.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Riddick drops to the ground. His arms and hands are now pierced with shards of boneyard ivory -- fashionable little body talons. Spotting a shadow on the combing, he draws closer. And sees Fry. Alone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Johns doubles back to Fry. He takes a hit of scotch, offers her some.
</DIRECTION>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Probably makes it worse. Dehydrates you even more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRY>
<JOHNS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Probably right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNS>
<DIRECTION>
They drink anyway. Moving out of the sun, Fry leans up against the combing. It brings her within arm's length of...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Riddick. He pulls a bone-shiv, freshly chiseled.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNS>
<DIRECTION>

Just as Riddick eases his blade toward Fry's neck...

<JOHNS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What'd Owens mean? 'Bout not touching the switch?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNS>
<DIRECTION>
Fry searches his eyes, wondering if she can trust him -- and again she leans back on the combing. We can actually see Riddick now. They could too, if they would just TURN THE FUCK AROUND!
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNS>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. You can tell me, Carolyn.

<JOHNS>

	You see anybody else here? Just between you and me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNS>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	During the landing...when things were at their worst...Owens was at his best. He's the one who wouldn't let the pilot dump the passenger cabin.

</FRY>
<DIRECTION>
Johns blinks, stunned. "Are you shittin' me?"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trying again, Riddick reaches out with his shiv -- and deftly slices off some of Fry's hair. A locket. A souvenir. That's all he wanted.
</DIRECTION>
<FRY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So now you know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRY>
<JOHNS>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck. Guess I'm more glad to be here than I thought.

Riddick watches them move off -- then looks at the scotch bottle, left behind. It's still got one good swallow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. START OF GAUNTLET - DAY

Leaving the boneyard, the scouting party reaches a cleft in the hills. Ahead is a canyon.

He jumps onto a rock, puts the scope to an eye.

EXT. GRAVE SITE - SPIRED HILLS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Working under the shade of a tarp, Zeke digs a communal grave. Three wrapped corpses wait nearby. He keeps a sight-line on...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crash ship. Shazza waves. Zeke waves back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RIBCAGE - THE GAUNTLET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The scouting party transits a narrowing canyon. Lined with rib bones, it makes us feel like we're in the belly of some beast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fry squints at the ridgetops. More of those spires are visible on the canyon rims, looming like silent sentinels. "What are they? Just mineral deposits?"
</DIRECTION>
<PILGRIM_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Captain...captain....
	</DIALOGUE>
</PILGRIM_1>
<DIRECTION>
The Chrislams have found what appears to be a small desert plant. Leathery petals are spread wide, revealing a round stringy core. ARABIC DISCUSSION. Desert fruit? Is it edible?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait, wait, wait....

Through a window, we see the Johns and the Chrislams crawling over the moisture-recovery unit, assessing repairs. PULL BACK to include Fry inside the settlement, inspecting...

Refectory table. Place settings out. Years of dust.

Fry nods. Johns smiles, leaves. Just as her heart settles, SOMETHING CREAKS behind her.
</DIRECTION>

It's an orrery, a mechanical device that shows the motion of the planets around their suns. Solar powered, the orrery starts turning, CREAKING. One planet seems always to have sunlight.

EXT. PORCH - SETTLEMENT - DAY

Fry reaches a porch. It looks out over the rear of the settlement and more unforgiving terrain. She starts back inside -- but something glints at the edge of her vision. Fry turns back...parts clothes on a laundry line...and sees the source of the glint.
</DIRECTION>

Excited hits on her breather.

Fry vaults off the porch -- and starts walking as if on magnetic bearing. Soon she's running.

Fry stops on a groomed runway, out of breath. The others catch up. They too marvel at...

A SCRABBLING SOUND stops Paris in mid-bite. He eases out of his rocker, moves to the rear edge of the ship and looks down on...

A shadow ducking under him. Small rocks still trickle down a dirt rampart just climbed by...someone.

</SHAZZA>
<DIRECTION>
No answer. Audrey springs to the other side of hold, puts an eye to a crack there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HULL-CRACK POV: Far away, Zeke finishes digging the grave. He starts toward the ship.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Audrey whirls back, mouths a silent alarm: "RIDDICK!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paris goes bloodless. Shazza grabs the war-pick out of his frozen hands, moves catlike to the main doors and poises there, ready to strike. Audrey follows with the hunting boomerang. All eyes watch as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sun-blades, winking off and on, chart Riddick's approach: We feel like we're inside a magician's sword box, watching the blades shave closer and closer to us. Suddenly he appears...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And Shazza swings hard.
</DIRECTION>
<AUDREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUDREY>
<DIRECTION>
Facing them is a TOTAL STRANGER -- burned, half naked, one hand still clutching the emergency-release lever of his cryo-locker. Shazza stopped one inch short of killing him.
</DIRECTION>
<TOTAL_STRANGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought...my God, I thought I was the only one who....
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOTAL_STRANGER>
<DIRECTION>
He lurches toward Shazza, trying to embrace her -- and sees blood and brain-bits BLAM-BLAMMING against her. His own. The stranger sinks bonelessly to the ground. FAST RACK to reveal Zeke in the background, pistol leveled. He reads Shazza's horrified face -- and understands what he's done.
</DIRECTION>
<PARIS>

	Oh, Lord....

	Cripes galore, I thought it was him. The murderin' ratbag. I thought he was....
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZEKE>
<DIRECTION>
He rushes over to check the dead stranger. As he bends down, FAST RACK AGAIN to reveal Riddick in the background. He stands 20 paces off, still unseen by the others. His goggle eyes covet...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zeke's breather.

START on the drag-sled carrying Corpse #4-- the stranger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zeke reaches the grave. The sun-tarp has fallen on one side, blocking the sight-line between ship and grave. Zeke starts to unload the body -- but sees something he didn't notice before: There's some kind of opening at the bottom of the grave.
</DIRECTION>
<ZEKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now what the bloody hell....
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZEKE>

Zeke hops down into the grave. CAMERA MOVES to reveal Riddick hidden among the spires. He's been waiting for a chance just like this.

Zeke drops to all fours. Looks into the tunnel. There seems to be some kind of burrow beyond.

Zeke takes a handlight off his belt, shines it into the burrow. It's the last thing he ever does.

Shazza sprints across hard-pack, heading for...

EXT. GRAVE SITE - SPIRED HILLS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The grave. She slaps aside the tarp to find...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Riddick. Bone-shiv in hand, he just stands on the other side of the grave. Shazza looks down. And SCREAMS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SPIRED HILLS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PURSUES Riddick as he lopes through the spires, running from the scene of the crime. He turns a blind corner -- and SOMETHING NEARLY BLOWS HIS HEAD OFF at close range. He hits ground. A boot steps on his neck, keeping him there.

Fry and Johns stand over the grave. It's a gory mess -- but no sign of Zeke. Johns has Riddick's confiscated shiv.
</DIRECTION>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He used that?

INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Riddick is back in chains, face pulpy from the beating, listening to SOTTO VOCE VOICES outside. Fry enters, looks at him hard.
</DIRECTION>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So where is he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRY>
<DIRECTION>
Riddick turns away, revealing a broken goggle-lens. The eye beneath is closed: For some reason, he won't look at her.
</DIRECTION>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me about the sounds. You told them you heard something right before....
	</DIALOGUE>

	What whispers?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRY>
<RIDDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The ones tellin' me to go for the sweet spot -- just to the left of the spine, fourth lumbar down. The abdominal aorta. What a gusher. Had a cup on his belt, so I used it to catch a little run-off. Metallic taste to it, human blood. Coppery. But if you cut it with peppermint schnapps, that goes away. Course, that's more for winter. Summertime, I take mine straight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIDDICK>
<DIRECTION>
Fry stares. Riddick gets a black satisfaction from his role as Boogeyman: If fear is the only kind of respect he can get, Riddick is going to grab some with both hands.
</DIRECTION>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't we try the truth now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRY>
<DIRECTION>
A head-shaking beat, then:
</DIRECTION>
<RIDDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All you people are so scared of me -- an' most days, I'd take that as a compliment -- but it ain't me you gotta worry about now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIDDICK>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Show me your eyes.

Again he turns away. She strips the goggles off. He sits with lids shut tight, anticipating the pain.
</DIRECTION>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Show me, Riddick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRY>
<DIRECTION>
Imagine a virgin undressing in front of someone for the first time. That's how Riddick opens his eyes, startling us: No irises, just huge black-pool pupils. And from deep within, a jewel-like eyeshine. His eyes are as beautiful and unsettling as those of a starved jaguar.
</DIRECTION>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You did this? To yourself?

	Let's just be sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRY>
<JOHNS>

	I am sure. Look, murders aside, Riddick belongs in the Asshole Hall of Fame. He loves the jaw-jackin', loves making you afraid, 'cuz that's all he has. And you're playing right into --

Letting her eyes adjust, Fry pats around lightly. Quickly she finds Zeke's handlight, tries it. Broken.

Fry makes an uphill turn. Sees a spray of light ahead. Worms forward to reach...

INT. THE LAIR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another chamber, wide and just large enough to stand in. Shafts of daylight bore down into the room. More old bones litter the floor. Fry moves into one shaft and looks up at...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An earthen funnel. The inside of a spire.
</DIRECTION>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're hollow....

CLICK-CLICK.

Fry slow-turns toward the sound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLICK-CLICK-CLICK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's something here, something just beyond the cusp of light. Something unfolding.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An icy hand grips her heart. Soundlessly, Fry backtracks her chain, but...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Something shadows across the exit. It stops her cold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her hand finds something new. She angles it to the light. It's one of Zeke's boots -- with a bit of Zeke still in it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLICKITY-CLICKITY-CLICKITY....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The whole chamber is coming alive around her, shadows unfurling, skulking the perimeter, circling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Something impales the boot out of her hand, reclaiming it. It was faster than a lightning-strike.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A paralyzed beat before...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fry makes her move, rolling back into the shaft of daylight and springing straight up into...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SPIRE - DAY

The spire. Bracing against the walls, Fry tries to "walk" her way up -- but her chain goes taut. Did it catch on something? Or did something catch it? Fry starts pounding the earthen walls.

CLOSE on her feet. Kicking hard at the walls, trying to gouge out footholds.

A stronger tug. Fry loses altitude, slipping closer to...

The MADLY CLICKING LAIR below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She tries to jettison her belt -- but can't brace herself up and undo the belt. Suddenly...

Hands digging in dirt.

Covertly, Audrey and Pilgrim #3 watch Riddick digging near the entrance of a tall windowless structure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He excavates a pair of broken eyeglasses... a shattered light... and a child's tin robot, timeless. Riddick thumbs a solar panel clean. The robot's language program warbles to life:

Now the storm shutters start yawning open, spreading daylight over Pilgrim #3 and...

The ceiling rafters. They're encrusted with thick nests of... something. The SKITTERING grows louder, more agitated.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sensing trouble, Pilgrim #3 hurries for a sliver of daylight in a wall -- the breach he entered through. He never gets there:

Sunlight hits the first nest. It EXPLODES WITH LIFE.

A NOISE from the supply room. Is it Ali? Just too scared to come out? Imam opens the door...

And hatchlings pour out.

<DIRECTION>
Moving with a gang-intelligence, they circle the room in a wave, soar high into the rafters -- then plunge into the coring shaft, SQUEALS VANISHING to infinity. Shocked silence, then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pilgrim #3 tumbles to the ground. He's been shredded into bloody kite-tails. There was a nest inside the supply room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Imam falls on him in grief. Johns and Fry inch forward to peer down...

The coring shaft. It's littered with human bones. The skeletons of the settlers. Scattered about and picked clean.

	You made it a problem when you let Owens die like that. When you had enough drugs to knock out a fucking mule-team.

	Owens was already dead. His brain just hadn't caught on to that fact.

He catches her hands -- and moves them around his body, forcing her into an embrace. We understand why when we see a CLOSEUP of her hands: They find a jagged purple scar beside his spine.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My first run-in with Riddick. Went for the sweet-spot and missed. They had to leave a piece of the shiv in there. I can feel it, sometimes, pressing against the cord.

	So maybe the care and feeding of my nerve-endings is my business.

O.S., we hear the Chrislams JABBERING ARABIC and calling for "Captain, Captain...."

EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fry and Johns move outside. The others have gathered, all eyes gang-locked on...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An arch in the sky. Luminous, ominous, it grows from the horizon.
</DIRECTION>
<PARIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do my eyes see?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARIS>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's starting....

They watch hypnotically as the arch rises, inching toward the two suns. Shazza shakes out of the trance first.

<SHAZZA>

	If we need anything from the crash ship -- I suggest we kick on. That sand-cat's solar.

</SHAZZA>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MULTIPLE SHOTS: Shazza cranking the sand-cat...hands snatching up lights, water, ropes...Chrislams piling aboard the sand-cat.
</DIRECTION>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	LET'S GET THOSE CELLS!
	</DIALOGUE>

Sand-cat moving...Riddick jumping onto the rear bed....Paris and Audrey running, catching up.

They turn back to see the rim of a giant planet. It's cresting over the horizon. The luminous arch is the planet's rings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RIBCAGE - THE GAUNTLET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sand-cat storms through the canyon. As it passes through the massive ribcage...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ROLL CAGE SMASHES OUT some low-bridge bones.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sand-cat reaches the crash ship. Bodies leap off. Paris steals a look at...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rising planet. It threatens to blot out suns, sky, universe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATTERY BAY - CRASH SHIP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Johns yanks the first power cell and starts dragging it over the deck. Riddick yanks a second cell and, carrying it on his shoulder, passes Johns with a suck-my-ass grin. Johns shoulders his cell and stumbles after.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shazza wheels the sand-cat around, getting clearance between it and the ship.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Chrislams lash a scrap-metal sled to the sand-cat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Riddick drops the first cell onto the sled, Johns the second. They're racing the eclipse and each other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SKY - DAY TO DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the rings of the planet eclipse the yellow sun.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. CRASH SHIP - DUSK

It's like God just closed a blind: Daylight dims. The change in light brings a GROWING HIGH-PITCHED SOUND.
</DIRECTION>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't stop, don't stop....
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRY>
<DIRECTION>
But Paris can't help himself. He squints to see...

EXT. SPIRED HILLS - DUSK

The spires. THE SOUND seems to come from there.

EXT. SKY - DUSK

As the rings eclipse the red sun.

EXT. CRASH SHIP - DEEP DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A second darkness sweeps over the survivors. Now they all stop, beholding...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SPIRED HILLS - DEEP DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Something pouring from the spire-tops. Backlit by coronal light, it first seems to be smoke or ash -- but soon we realize these are living things, HATCHLINGS SQUEALING IN DELIGHT over their first nightfall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CRASH SHIP - DEEP DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, how many can there....
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNS>
<DIRECTION>
They keep coming, filling the sky with thick waves. Mercifully, the hatchlings seem to be moving away. But now one wave cleaves from another -- and does a quick about-face.
</DIRECTION>
<PARIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a suggestion, but perhaps we should flee.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARIS>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cargo hold, everyone in the cargo hold. lesgo, lesgo, lesgo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRY>
<DIRECTION>
They run. Reach the cargo hold. Turn back to see...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Riddick and Shazza still coming. Hearing the SQUEALING WAVE descending on them...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Riddick and Shazza hit to the dirt. Hatchlings torrent just inches overhead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE on Shazza. Horrified. Hard to breathe. Like being underwater.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE on Riddick. He watches in awe, no more frightened that a kid lying on his back looking up at the stars. Experimenting, he eases a bone-shiv into the hatchlings. Instantly it's whittled down to nothing. It's like a river of razor blades.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hatchling keep coming. Shazza whips a panicky look at the cargo hold. Can she make it? Should she even try?
</DIRECTION>
<AUDREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell her to stay there. Stay down. SHAZZA, JUST STAY DOWN!
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUDREY>
<DIRECTION>
Shazza starts worming toward the cargo hold. Suddenly the hatchings vanish. A beat. Is it safe? Shazza gets to her feet...
</DIRECTION>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no, NO, NO, NO....
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRY>
<DIRECTION>
...and the wave is back, enveloping Shazza.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. CARGO HOLD - DEEP DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standing in the mouth of the cargo container, the others get a last glimpse of Shazza as she flies by the doors, caught up in the funnel-cloud of hatchlings. Then she's simply gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CRASH SHIP - DEEP DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Still on the ground, Riddick checks left and right like someone about to cross a busy street. Now he gets up, smacks his hands clean, strolls for the hold. Behind him...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A rising GANG-CLICKING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE on Fry. She knows the sound better than anyone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SPIRED HILLS - DEEP DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The spires are crumbling, torn down from within.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CRASH SHIP - DEEP DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reaching the cargo hold, Riddick turns around for one last look. PUSH IN as he sheds goggles -- and looks at the world with his jaguar eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RIDDICK'S POV: In degraded image, we see the predators -- adult hatchlings -- emerge from the spires. They're large, mammalian, hammer-headed. They CLICK with echo-location, sounding out the world they haven't inhabited in 60 years.
</DIRECTION>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it? What's happening?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRY>
<DIRECTION>
RIDDICK'S POV: The predators launch from the hills, gliding, SOUNDING, searching.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CARGO HOLD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vault-like DOORS BOOM CLOSED.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The survivors are locked inside the only secure part of the ship. Somehow they've been reduced to neanderthals huddling in their cave, listening to the howls of the sabertooths.
</DIRECTION>
<AUDREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if...what if she's still out there... still alive....

</AUDREY>
<JOHNS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I don't want to jump to conclusions here...but 'member that boneyard? These just might be the fuckers that killed every other living thing on this planet, okay? Chances of Shazza knockin' on that door anytime soon are just about zero squared.

<IMAM>

Imam is listening at the cargo door. The others pile up alongside, ears tuned like radar. CLICKING SWEEPS PAST outside.

(whispering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do they do that? Make that sound?
	</DIALOGUE>

	Perhaps the way they see. With sound, reflecting back.

(realizing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Echo-location. That's what it is....
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRY>
<DIRECTION>
Now MORE CLICKING -- behind them. Lights whip around to find...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing. Only the door of an open container about halfway down the tunnel-like hold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A volley of looks. "How the fuck could one get in here?"
</DIRECTION>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Breach in the hull. I dunno.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRY>
<DIRECTION>
More CLICKING. Johns realizes they expect him to check it out.

More CLICKING -- along with the sound of TOPPLING CARGO.
</DIRECTION>
<RIDDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Big beads.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIDDICK>
<DIRECTION>
Butching up, Johns sucks on his breather and shimmies toward...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The open container. Leading with his shotgun, he FIRES blindly around the door. Something SQUEALS -- then silence. Johns eases his head and a light around the door to spot...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hatchlings on the ground, blasted into dog food.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNS>
<DIRECTION>
(to others)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. We're okay. Just some small ones that musta --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNS>
<DIRECTION>
Something WHOOSHES for his head, swinging like a scythe. It catches his shotgun, DISCHARGING IT, giving us...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A flash-image of an adult predator. Up close.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In one thin second, Johns is back with the others.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNS>

	Very big beads.

INT. FIRST CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Imam shepherds them into a container. The door slams closed. At first, only the sound of MOUTHS SUCKING BREATHERS. Then a SCRATCHING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Johns fumbles with a cutting torch. Gets it burning. Adjusts the gasses to illuminate...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door. Scythe-like blades are probing joints. Suddenly HEAVY BLOWS drive everyone back.
</DIRECTION>
<RIDDICK>
<DIRECTION>
(to Johns)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you do sumpin' else with that? 'Sides holding it in my fucking face?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIDDICK>
<DIRECTION>
Taking the hint, Johns starts cutting the common wall between containers. It's a race between the sparks of his cutter and the blades of the predators.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SECOND CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An burn-outline appears in the common wall. Johns kicks out the escape hatch. Audrey speed-crawls through first as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FIRST CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Predators shred into the container right behind them, CLICKING, sweeping, hunting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THIRD/FOURTH CONTAINERS - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SERIES OF SHOTS: Again and again, they burn a new escape hatch just as the predators break into the container being vacated, always entering darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FIFTH CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside their fifth container now, Johns torches away. Fry and Paris use cargo to block the entrance hole -- then block the cargo with their bodies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Riddick adds his weight -- until he notices pepper-shot in the cargo. Suspecting the worst, he leaves the others behind...
</DIRECTION>
<PARIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, hello?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARIS>
<DIRECTION>
...and moves to the front of the container where darkness prevails. Something SQUISHES underfoot. He slips off goggles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RIDDICK'S POV: Of dead hatchlings on the floor. This is the open container, the one where Johns found predators.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sensing energy, Riddick lifts his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RIDDICK'S POV: Of an adolescent predator. It squats atop cargo, eating a hatchling. A heavy bone-blade crowns its skull.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sensing Riddick, it sweeps the area with INQUISITIVE CLICKS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PREDATOR POV: Of Riddick.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(NOTE: The PREDATOR POV is a crude image that gives impression without detail. We're "seeing" what the predator hears with echo-location. Think of a sonagram that strobes and wraps its subject in 3-D space.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Oblivious, the others kick out the new escape hatch. Audrey, Fry, and Johns worm through. Imam and Pilgrim #2 hang back. "Where's Riddick?"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's in a stare-down with a predator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Searching, Pilgrim #2 rounds a corner -- and finds his head caught in a vice-like grip.
</DIRECTION>
<RIDDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't. Move.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIDDICK>
<DIRECTION>
RIDDICK'S POV: As a second predator appears above them. This one reaches down with its scythe blade...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And gently probes the two men. It wants know what they're made of.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE on the pilgrim's shoes. Over-running with piss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
More blades descend, moving over them like surgical instruments. One test-slices Riddick's shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SIXTH CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the next container, Fry waits anxiously. Hissing through the escape hatch:

	Imam? Where are they?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRY>

</DIRECTION>
<RIDDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No....
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIDDICK>
<DIRECTION>
The predators are on him, just blurs in the dark. DEATH-SCREAM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RIDDICK'S POV: A third predator appears above him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Making his move, Riddick darts around cargo and heads for the escape hatch as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fry's light catches him square in the face. Blinded, Riddick HOWLS and stumbles forward. Fry's light leaps deeper to hit...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The predator right behind him. With a similar reaction, the beast HOWLS and flails back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HOLD on Fry for a time-stopped moment. What stopped it? Was it really her? Suddenly a SHOTGUN EXPLODES beside her head. Jacked up, Johns is BLASTING shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<FRY>

They give him a look. "Sure you did." Suddenly a CARCASS SLAMS to the floor, sending everyone jumping back in a perfect splash- pattern. "Christ, he did kill one."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fry reclaims her dropped light and beams it on the carcass. Wherever the light strikes it, the flesh chars and steams.
</DIRECTION>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There....

</FRY>
<JOHNS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	79 kilos.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNS>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because you're 79 kilos of gutless white meat, and that's why you can't come up with a better plan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRY>
<DIRECTION>
He makes a move for her. Riddick blocks. Johns' shotgun bumps the underside of Riddick's chin.
</DIRECTION>
<RIDDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Think about that reward, Johns.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIDDICK>
<JOHNS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm willing to take a cut in pay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNS>
<RIDDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How 'bout a cut in your gut?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIDDICK>
<DIRECTION>
Johns looks down. CAMERA DROPS to reveal the shiv Riddick holds, poised for evisceration.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Trash Baby, you're gonna regret this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNS>
<IMAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please...this solves nothing...please....
	</DIALOGUE>
</IMAM>
<DIRECTION>
Johns backs off first. The light grows dimmer.
</DIRECTION>
<FRY>
<DIRECTION>
(to Audrey)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're afraid of our light. That means we don't have to be so afraid of them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRY>
<IMAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you're certain you can find the way back? Even in the dark?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IMAM>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I'm not. But he can.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRY>
<DIRECTION>
She's pointing, of course, to Riddick.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PLANET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The eclipsing planet dominates half the sky. In whatever coronal light remains, we see clouds forming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CRASH SHIP - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cargo doors crack open. Mixed for maximum flame, the cutter is pushed outside and swept around. Fry appears behind it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Moving like hostages, the survivors cross open ground, trying not to heed the PRIMAL SOUNDS beyond their light. Soon they reach...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The main cabin. Blackness inside.
</DIRECTION>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Riddick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRY>
<DIRECTION>
He lifts his goggles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RIDDICK'S POV: Checking the cabin. Finding a lot of wreckage but no life.
</DIRECTION>
<RIDDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looks clear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIDDICK>
<DIRECTION>
Johns shoulders ahead and crawls in first. Just as he stands up inside...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A PREDATOR BUZZSAWS over his head, fleeing the cabin, taking off into the night.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck me. You said "clear."
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNS>
<RIDDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Said "looks clear."
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIDDICK>
<JOHNS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, what's it look like now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNS>
<RIDDICK>
<DIRECTION>
(rechecking)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looks clear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIDDICK>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just get the goddamn lights on....
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRY>
<DIRECTION>
They scramble aboard. Riddick TONGUE-CLICKS behind Johns. He isn't amused.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PREP MONTAGE: We see the survivors powering up cabin lights... yanking three more cells from the battery bay...threading nylon cord through Paris' misting umbrellas, filling the reservoirs with high-octane liquor...swapping out O2 canisters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reloading his shotgun, Johns finds himself shaking again. He unpockets a shell -- a red morphine shell -- and gives it a lover's look. Behind him...
</DIRECTION>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ready, Johns.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRY>
<DIRECTION>
He palms the shell.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He'll lead you over the first cliff. You know that, don't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNS>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're just burnin' light here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRY>
<JOHNS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You give him the cells and the ship -- and he will leave you. He will leave you all out there to die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNS>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't get it, Johns. What is so goddamn valuable in your life that you're worried about losing? Huh? Is there anything at all? Besides your next hype?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(no response)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Got no right to be so scared. Neither one of us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATTERY BAY - CRASH SHIP - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As hands yank the last power cell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cabin lights die. Still brooding, Johns finishes loading his shotgun in the dark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CRASH SHIP - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE on a burning wick. Alcohol mist shoots across the flame to create...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FIREBALL. Two umbrella torches, fabric already burned away, BELCH FIREBALLS into the night. By this light and more, we see...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Imam chained into the first harness of the drag-sled. Beside him, Johns fumbles with a second harness. Hands help him into the chains. The hands belong to...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Riddick. Both men recognize the irony of the prisoner helping his captor into chains.
</DIRECTION>
<FRY>
<DIRECTION>
(to all)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep the light going. That's all we have to do to live through this. Just keep your light burning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRY>
<DIRECTION>
Riddick loops a handlight over his neck, places it to shine light down his back. A beacon.
</DIRECTION>
<RIDDICK>
<DIRECTION>
(to Fry)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be runnin' about 10 paces ahead. I want light on my back -- but not in my eyes. And check your cuts. These things know our blood now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIDDICK>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE on Audrey. Overhearing, she goes stone-faced.
</DIRECTION>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Riddick...was thinkin' we should make some kind of deal. Just in case, you know, this actually --
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRY>
<RIDDICK>
<DIRECTION>
(shaking head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Had it with deals.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIDDICK>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I just wanted to say --
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRY>
<RIDDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nobody's gonna turn a murderer loose. I fuckin' knew better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIDDICK>
<DIRECTION>
It worries Fry. "If he doesn't expect to go free...."
</DIRECTION>
<RIDDICK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Been a long time since anyone's trusted me. That's somethin' right there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIDDICK>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can, can't we? Trust you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRY>
<RIDDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(completely genuine)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what I been askin' myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIDDICK>
<DIRECTION>
He walks away. HOLD on Fry -- wondering if she hasn't made a terrible, terrible mistake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The drag-sled begins moving.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SERIES OF TRACKING SHOTS: Riddick running point, goggles off, eyes flashing. Johns and Imam pulling the drag-sled like malamutes, handlights sweeping. Pilgrims #1 at the first side- guard position, Fry and Audrey at the second, each position carrying an umbrella torch, FIREBALLS BLAZING. Paris stumbling along at rear-point, sweeping the cutter back and forth, every shadow a threat. They are a train of light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE on the sled. Holding four power cells and eight bottles of booze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE on Fry. Looking down. Noting sand-cat tracks underfoot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Below us run the survivors. CRANE UP AND AWAY so that their lights become insignificant...so that we include, in FOREGROUND, the silhouettes of gliding predators. They're following from above, awaiting their chance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FRY'S POV: Of the ground. The sand-cat tracks have vanished.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you noticed too?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNS>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Riddick. Riddick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRY>
<DIRECTION>
The procession grinds to a halt. Everyone sucks hard on breathers as they muster inside the light.
</DIRECTION>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are the sand-cat tracks? Why aren't we still following them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRY>
<RIDDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Saw something I didn't like.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIDDICK>
<JOHNS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Such as.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNS>
<RIDDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hard to tell, sometimes...even for me... but looked like a bunch of those big boys chewin' each other's gonads off. Thought we'd swing wide. Okay by you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIDDICK>
<DIRECTION>
Paris looks over his shoulder. "We went around what?" Nearby CLICKING breaks up the confrontation.
</DIRECTION>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's move.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Audrey)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a detour. He'll get us there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRY>
<PARIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can we switch?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARIS>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What, switch what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRY>
<PARIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I twisted my ankle running backwards like that. And I'm not sure I can....
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off their stares)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, that's a lie. I just don't want to be alone back there anymore. If you could just give me a few minutes up front here --
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARIS>
<JOHNS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's the pilot, she should stay close to the cells.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNS>
<PARIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, so I'm disposable?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARIS>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll switch, I'll switch! Christ, just get this train moving!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRY>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They trundle on, Fry the new tail-gunner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At side guard, Paris relaxes a bit -- even though the CLICKING never seems far from earshot. A weak FIREBALL SPEWS from his torch. He checks the reservoir. Almost empty.
</DIRECTION>
<PARIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Light, please, need light here....
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARIS>
<DIRECTION>
Still moving, Johns and Imam train lights on Paris while he refuels. For a brief moment, Audrey strays from the light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PREDATOR'S POV: Dive-bombing the girl.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HIGH-VELOCITY CLICKING: It's like an incoming missile. Imam lunges at the last nanosecond...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And flattens Audrey to the ground. Scythe blades swing...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHINKING the harness-chains on Imam's back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Johns whirls, BLASTS. Light-beams leap around. But the predator is long gone.
</DIRECTION>
<IMAM>
<DIRECTION>
(trembling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please...have we been cut? Can someone tell me if....
	</DIALOGUE>
</IMAM>
<DIRECTION>
He finds his dropped light, thumbs the switch again and again. Broken.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the confusion, Paris has been left in the dark. Something slashes him from behind. It's like the night has claws.
</DIRECTION>
<PARIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, sweet Jesus....
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARIS>
<DIRECTION>
The bottle drops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The blood flows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CLICKING STOPS.
</DIRECTION>
<PARIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, sweet Jesus, WILL YOU GET ME SOME LIGHT OVER HERE!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARIS>
<DIRECTION>
Faces whip around. But before their lights can rescue him...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paris is gone, snatched away by a swooping blur.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Light-beams jump fitfully, vainly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RIDDICK'S POV: Of predators feasting on Paris. Carrying a youngling on its back, a female predator arrives late and can't find a place at the trough. With shocking apathy, it whips the youngling off its back and begins devouring it. Other predators start in-fighting, killing themselves for food. POV PANS to a pair of predators, closer, SOUNDING out new prey. POV PANS AGAIN to include the object of their desire. Audrey.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE on Riddick. Trying to figure it out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE on Audrey. Listening to the HORRIFIC FEEDING SOUNDS. Oblivious to all the attention she's getting.
</DIRECTION>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you see? Riddick?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRY>
<RIDDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hunger. I see 60 years of hunger.

EXT. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

Into a rising wind, the survivors range on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Audrey now carries Paris' torch, refueled and COUGHING FIREBALLS at regular intervals. Fry seems to be handling rear-point fairly well, until...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cutter sputters and dies. She ditches it and takes the torch from Audrey.
</DIRECTION>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bottle-count.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRY>
<AUDREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Four fulls, one half. That mean we're halfway there? I hope?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUDREY>
<DIRECTION>
Good question. They've just been blindly following...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The light on Riddick's back.
</DIRECTION>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can we pick up the pace?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRY>
<DIRECTION>
Working like a mule, Johns growls to himself. "If you think you can do better...." Abruptly he slaps an arm across Imam's chest, spotting...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sled-track. In front of them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fry hears a SHOTGUN RATCHET. She spins to see...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Johns out of his chains. Moving forward. Jamming the shotgun into the back of Riddick's neck.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We aren't completely stupid.

</FRY>
<RIDDICK>

</RIDDICK>
<DIRECTION>
Imagine a hundred Geiger-counters next to a truckload of plutonium. That's the SOUND that rides the wind now.
</DIRECTION>
<RIDDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Canyon ahead. I circled once to buy some time to think.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIDDICK>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Think about what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRY>
<JOHNS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	About how to kill us and still get these cells to the skiff. Goddamnit, we're just doin' the heavy lifting for this prick!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNS>
<RIDDICK>
<DIRECTION>
(answering Fry)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	About the girl.

</RIDDICK>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRY>
<RIDDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What it's gonna be like when we hit that canyon. With her bleeding.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIDDICK>

(agreeing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. She's not.

It hits Fry like a two-by-four. She looks at Audrey.
</DIRECTION>
<AUDREY>
<DIRECTION>
(confessing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't want you to leave me there... back at the ship...that's why I didn't say anything....

	Aw, this can't be happening to me....

	They been nose-open for her ever since we left. They go off blood.

(scanning)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is no "safe."

An epic beat. The wind gusts...the FLAMES CHATTER...their ears fill with CANYON SOUNDS.
</DIRECTION>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not gonna work. We gotta go back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRY>
<DIRECTION>
Johns brays.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, you're the one who got me out here, turned me into a goddamn sled dog. An' now you 'spect me to go back like a whipped dog?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNS>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was wrong. I admit it. My bad, okay? Now let's just go back to the ship.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRY>
<JOHNS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I dunno. Nice breeze, wide open spaces -- you know, I'm startin' to enjoy myself out here.

</JOHNS>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you fucking high again? Just listen to --
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRY>
<JOHNS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no, you're right, Fry. What's to be afraid of? My life is a steamin' pile of meaningless toadshit anyhow. So I say mush on! Canyon's only couple hundred meters, after that we're in Skiff City! So why don't you just butch up, stuff a cork in that kid, and get --

</JOHNS>
<IMAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's the captain, we should listen to --

	<DIALOGUE>
	This does not help us, Johns.

</JOHNS>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just shut up, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRY>
<JOHNS>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNS>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you RAG YOUR STUPID HOLE!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRY>
<DIRECTION>
She rushes him, ready to rip his eyes out. He shunts her aside.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're not alive because of her -- we're alive in spite of her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNS>
<DIRECTION>
He swung below the belt -- and connected. Fry's chin quakes, her knees fail. The undertow of events finally pulls her down.
</DIRECTION>
<FRY>

	We cannot go through there....

	Fine, fine, you've made your point. We can all be so scared as you.

Johns snatches a light away from Imam.

EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT

They trudge on, slower now, building reserves for the canyon-run. At rear-point, Fry follows like a broken rudder. Pilgrim #1 now draws the sled with Imam. And up ahead...

<DIRECTION>
EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT

Johns falls in step with Riddick.

</JOHNS>
<RIDDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just realized that, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIDDICK>
<DIRECTION>
CLICKING nearby. Johns BLASTS the night, driving the sound away -- and reminding everyone of who carries the Big Gauge.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Six of us left. If we could get through that canyon and lose just one, that'd be quite a fucking feat, huh? A good thing, right?

<RIDDICK>

	Not if I'm the one.

EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT

	Look, it's hellified stuff -- but no different than those battlefield doctors when they have to decide who lives and who dies. It's called "triage," okay?

	Kept calling it "murder" when I did it.

	Sacrifice play. Hack up one body, leave it at start of the canyon. Like a bucket of chum.

</FRY>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FIGHT SCENE: Johns' light hits the ground, creating an arena of illumination. FAST CLICKING nearby. Still struggling, Riddick and Johns somehow manage to gang-aim the shotgun and BLAST THE CLICKING AWAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shotgun goes free. Johns lunges for it, but Riddick kicks it into the night. And then pulls his shiv.
</DIRECTION>
<RIDDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gotta stay in the light, Johns. That's the only rule.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIDDICK>
<DIRECTION>
Johns circles inside the light. Fucking with him, Riddick starts poking and jabbing, backing him up against the wail of dark. Johns stumbles over something. A bone. A club.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Riddick finds his own bone-club, and now they go at it like two cavemen. Riddick beats on Johns' club-hand, breaking fingers, forcing him to drop the bone. Just trying to get away now, Johns makes a desperate lunge for the light, but...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Riddick shivs open his back.
</DIRECTION>
<RIDDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Remember that moment?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIDDICK>
<DIRECTION>
Gushing blood, Johns starts crawling pathetically with the light. Riddick dogs him.
</DIRECTION>
<RIDDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shoulda never took the chains off, Johns. You were one brave fuck, before. Now look at you. Oh, yeah, you were Billy Bad-ass with your gauge...with your chains....
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIDDICK>
<DIRECTION>
Johns finds the shotgun. "And I'm still Billy Bad-ass." He sweeps it around with the light, ready to kill...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blackness. Where'd Riddick go?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLICKING behind Johns. He whirls to see...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Something big coming for him. Johns BLASTS IT back into the night, dropping the light as he does. Eyes in the back of his head, he whirls again and takes aim on...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another bull-rushing predator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Johns triggers a bad round. Crazed, he ratchets and levels the shotgun for another try. He's too late.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BIG CLOSEUP as the ejected shell rolls to a stop. It's red. Johns loaded a morphine shell in the dark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RIDDICK'S POV: With Johns skewered by the armpits, the predator lifts him off the ground and "stares" with a deceptively gentle CLICKING-COOING SOUND.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PREDATOR'S POV: Of Johns' final expression.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RIDDICK'S POV: The predator rears back its head -- then slams forward, hitting Johns with the full force of its skull-blade, splitting him in two.
</DIRECTION>

Fry, Imam, Audrey, Pilgrim #1. They're running, stumbling, trying to backtrack the sled marks. Checking for pursuit, Fry looks over her shoulder...

BLACK SCREEN. We hear the canyon in full cry now -- CLICKING... BATTLING BONE-BLADES...MATING CRIES...the RENDING OF FLESH and SNAPPING OF TENDON. Far below, twin flames appear as the survivors reach the gauntlet. Predators perch in FOREGROUND, just hulking silhouettes "watching" from a canyon rim.

Pilgrim #1. Clutching a handlight.

SLEW OF SHOTS: Fry and Imam on the move, dragging the shield fast. Audrey speed-crawling beneath. Pilgrim #1 tripping along behind the shield.

Thin blue liquid spatters them.

More spattering. Fry looks up -- and stumbles when she beholds...

A ceiling of predators. At the cusp of light, they dive and weave and dart, slashing each other in a rabid desire to SOUND OUT the humans below. It's like looking into a bucket of angry eels.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going!

His voice whips them like the Devil's coxswain. Chastened, Fry keeps her eyes down and speed up.

More blue blood showers down -- followed by entrails dropping out of the sky. Could this be Hell itself?
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
Now WHOLE CORPSES ARE CRASHING DOWN around them, victims of in-fighting. Fry and Imam start slaloming through the ghastly mess.

Pilgrim #1 passes too close to a corpse: A blade slices his leg, drawing blood. He keeps his mouth shut.

But Audrey, on all fours, has to discover the corpses with her hands. Then, taking exception at being walked on...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One "corpse" snaps at her. Audrey recoils sideways...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And tumbles down the mound of corpses. She's exposed.

Audrey shakes out of it and scrambles for the shield just as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A predator kamikazes onto the shield, its bone-blades piercing the metal...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And nearly skewering Audrey beneath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Caught in torchlight, steaming, the PREDATOR HOWLS as it tries to rip free of the shield.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beneath, Audrey hangs on and takes a thrashing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The predator tears clear, spins, pounces blindly at...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Riddick, standing at light's edge. Stunningly, he catches the beast under its scythe blades, blunting the attack. The predator CLICKS MADLY at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PREDATOR'S POV: Of Riddick's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The predator rears back its head, ready to bisect Riddick with its skull-blade.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Switchblade fast, Riddick drops a hand...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...yanks his shiv...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and sweeps it over the belly of the beast. HOWLING, the predator falls, disemboweled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REACTION SHOTS of Fry and Imam. Stunned.

Suddenly Pilgrim #1 reappears, thrust back into the light by unseen forces. He's still alive -- but shouldn't be. He makes a feeble attempt to grab onto Imam, to anyone, but he's gone again before they can even react, jerked out of the light. Out of existence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They flail on. And now, finally...finally....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The canyon widens, opening up like some door to Heaven. The WORST SOUNDS fall behind. We can see it in their sweat-sheened faces: The faintest hope that maybe they've survived the Seventh Circle of Hell. But then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The TORCHES SPIT AND SPUTTER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Audrey hears PATTERING on the metal shield.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blood falls anew.

One torch dies -- yet somehow comes back to life.

Imam upturns a hand, checking the liquid for color. But this blood has no hue.

Riddick disappears over the rise. The four cells follow, slithering through the mud like a serpent's tail.

Drenched in light, Riddick stands in the hatchway of the skiff, looking out into dark rain. Is he struggling with a decision? Or just savoring the safe harbor? Then very deliberately...

Riddick dims interior lights, activates exterior lights. He's actually startled by the sight of...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fry. Standing in the skiffs headbeams. Daring him to run her over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eye-lock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Riddick opens the hatch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SKIFF - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They meet at opposite ends of the gangway -- Fry in the rain, Riddick in the light.
</DIRECTION>
<RIDDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Strong survival instinct. Admire that in a woman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIDDICK>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not leaving. Not until we go back for the others.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRY>
<DIRECTION>
He laughs at that.
</DIRECTION>
<FRY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I promised them we'd go back with more light. And that's exactly what we're gonna do..
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRY>
<RIDDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Think you've mistaken me for somebody who gives a fuck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIDDICK>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What, you're afraid?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRY>
<RIDDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Confusin' me with Johns now -- fear was his monkey. I only deal in life and death. All that stuff in between? Some shade of grey my eyes don't see.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIDDICK>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I trusted you, Riddick. Goddamn, I trusted that some part of you wanted to rejoin the human race.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRY>
<RIDDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Truthfully? I wouldn't know how.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIDDICK>
<DIRECTION>
Fry realizes it's impossible to shame a shameless man. With desperation edging her voice:
</DIRECTION>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then wait for me. I'll go back myself. Just give me more light for them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRY>
<DIRECTION>
He tosses her a light. The broken one.
</DIRECTION>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just come with me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRY>
<RIDDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Got a better idea. Come with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIDDICK>
<DIRECTION>
Fry's mouth moves but nothing comes out.
</DIRECTION>
<RIDDICK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're already dead. Get on board.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIDDICK>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're fuckin' with me. I know you are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRY>
<RIDDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Course I am -- but doesn't mean I won't leave you here. If you believe anything about me, better be that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIDDICK>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you see, I promised them...I have to...I have to go and....
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRY>
<DIRECTION>
She's bleeding resolve. Riddick can see it -- can smell it -- and he keeps slashing away.
</DIRECTION>
<RIDDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Step aboard, Carolyn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIDDICK>
<FRY>
<DIRECTION>
(tortured)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't....I can't....
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRY>
<RIDDICK>
<DIRECTION>
(approaching, extending a hand)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here. Make it easy on you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIDDICK>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't do this to me....
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRY>
<RIDDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just give me your hand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIDDICK>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But they...they could still be....
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRY>
<RIDDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No one's gonna blame you. C'mon. Take my hand and save yourself, Carolyn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIDDICK>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. She takes his hand -- and jerks him down the gangway. They sprawl through mud. She gets a knee on his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will not give up on them! I Will not leave anyone on this rock with those fucking things, even if it means --
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRY>
<DIRECTION>
In a blur, Riddick rolls and slaps a shiv on her neck. Is history repeating itself? Riddick's face, though, is strangely calm. Curious. Even gentle.
</DIRECTION>
<RIDDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'd die for them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIDDICK>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would try for them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRY>
<RIDDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You barely know them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIDDICK>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I'm human. I know you view that as a weakness, but I'm sorry -- I do feel fear, theirs too. Goddamnit, Riddick -- yes. I would die for them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRY>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CREVICE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MORE SCRABBLING at the shield. Imam cocks his blade back, ready to do battle with...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fry. She heaves the shield aside. Behind her, Riddick.
</DIRECTION>
<AUDREY>
<DIRECTION>
(big-eyed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You came for us....
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUDREY>
<RIDDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, yeah -- we're all fuckin' amazed. Anyone not ready for this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIDDICK>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Protected by the meager light of two glow-worm bottles, the four remaining survivors head out.
</DIRECTION>
<RIDDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tighter, tighter....
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIDDICK>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MUDDY RISE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<RIDDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIDDICK>
<DIRECTION>
They pile up awkwardly. Fry listens hard. Only RAINFALL.
</DIRECTION>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't hear --
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRY>
<DIRECTION>
He covers her mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RIDDICK'S POV: Water has pooled at the base of the muddy rise. A predator drinks there.
</DIRECTION>
<RIDDICK>
<DIRECTION>
(on his breath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doesn't see us...wait for it to leave....
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIDDICK>
<DIRECTION>
RIDDICK'S POV: Another predator lands to drink. Then another. Their backs are to us, but the pool is turning into a major gathering place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Soon they all can hear CLICKING above the RAIN. Their nightmare is far from over.
</DIRECTION>
<RIDDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get behind me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIDDICK>
<DIRECTION>
RIDDICK'S POV: Of a half-dozen predators shifting places at the pool. A slim gap appears.
</DIRECTION>
<RIDDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When I go, we go. Full-throttle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIDDICK>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE on their hands, gripping each other.
</DIRECTION>
<RIDDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ready...ready....
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIDDICK>
<DIRECTION>
RIDDICK'S POV: The gap between predators widens into a passage. A gauntlet within a gauntlet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Riddick runs. Linked like paper dolls, the others follow blindly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RIDDICK'S POV: Of a predator turning to "stare" over its shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PREDATOR'S POV: Of Riddick bearing down fast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The survivors hit the water like lawn mowers on legs, crashing through, scattering water and predators alike, managing to reach...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The muddy rise. Audrey loses her grip on the others...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And starts back-sliding. She CRIES OUT, turning the head of...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Riddick. He catches Audrey as her legs hit the pool. He muscles her back up the rise and heaves her over the top, sending her slip-sliding down the other side.
</DIRECTION>
<RIDDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know the way!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIDDICK>
<DIRECTION>
Not waiting for him, Fry and Imam disappear over the rise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RIDDICK'S POV: Of the predators. Regrouping. Crawling up the rise at us.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fry, Imam, and Audrey run hard, glow-worm lights bouncing wildly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RIDDICK'S POV: Chasing them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PREDATOR'S POV: Chasing Riddick.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SETTLEMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fry, Imam, and Audrey reach the settlement. They spill around a corner and see...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The light of the skiff.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SETTLEMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RIDDICK'S POV: Ahead of us, we see Fry, Imam, and Audrey vanishing around the corner. BREATHING LIKE A RACEHORSE, we follow in their steps, storming around the same corner. Suddenly a predator is right there, right in our face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PREDATOR'S POV: Of Riddick skidding to a stop. He snaps a look up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RIDDICK'S POV: Of another predator perched gargoyle-like on the building. It SPEED-CLICKS at us.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PREDATOR'S POV: Of Riddick slowly pulling two shivs. Bracing himself. Ready to blade it out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SKIFF - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Imam and Audrey stagger aboard. Safe in the light of the headbeams, Fry turns back, panting, waiting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Waiting.
</DIRECTION>
<IMAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Captain....
	</DIALOGUE>
</IMAM>
<DIRECTION>
He wants her to board the skiff. Fry gives it another beat, eyes sweeping the dark rain. And just when we think it's over for Riddick -- TERRIBLE SCREAMS are heard from both man and predator: There's a helluva fight going on out there. Close out there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fry snatches the glow-worms off Imam's neck...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And plunges into the darkness, homing in on the SOUNDS until...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A blade flashes in her face. She ducks and spots...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Riddick. Bloody, muddy, he's down on his knees, still trying to fight off the shadow-beasts that swirl and slash all around him. Around them both.
</DIRECTION>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's me, it's me, it's me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRY>
<DIRECTION>
She gets the light around his neck. Now we see his face clearly -- and see a very human expression there: Fear. Fry grabs his armpits and tries to pull him up.
</DIRECTION>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, Riddick -- said I'd die for them, not you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRY>
<DIRECTION>
He gets his feet under him. Gripping each other, they start moving, turning like dancers in a macabre waltz, hoping the predators can't fix on Riddick's blood.
</DIRECTION>
<FRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just 10 steps...keep turning, keep turning...that's right...others're already 'board, waitin' for us right now...five steps...c'mon, almost there, Riddick... almost there...we're almost --
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRY>
<DIRECTION>
Something jolts them. ALL CLICKING STOPS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXTREME CLOSEUPS: Searching each other's eyes. Someone just got slashed from behind, slashed bad. But who?
</DIRECTION>
<RIDDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not for me....
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIDDICK>
<DIRECTION>
In an eyeblink she's gone, ripped from his arms. There was no scream. No cry. No final words. Just...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blackness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PLANET'S ORBIT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Out of the blackness, a spot of fire races toward us. It resolves into the skiff, fabric wings burning off as it hits escape velocity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SKIFF - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE on a bloody hand. It toggles through nav-charts, plots a rendezvous with "Sol-Track 17B" shipping lane.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the cockpit, Riddick finds Audrey beside him. She stares hypnotically at the stars ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<RIDDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Probably okay to talk to me now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIDDICK>
<AUDREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not sure where to go. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing started.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where you goin'?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUDREY>
<RIDDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not sure. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing....
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIDDICK>
<DIRECTION>
Interior smiles. Stars sweep the windscreen as the skiff makes a course-correction. One very bright star comes into view.
</DIRECTION>
<RIDDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Might interest you....
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIDDICK>
<DIRECTION>
Imam moves forward. Seeing, his face lifts.
</DIRECTION>
<IMAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	New Mecca....
	</DIALOGUE>
</IMAM>
<RIDDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Think a soul could get lost there? With all those pilgrim-types?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIDDICK>
<IMAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's more a place where souls are found, Mr. Riddick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IMAM>
<DIRECTION>
As Riddick ponders the possibilities, we CUT TO...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PLANET'S ORBIT - NEW DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The first sun flares out from behind the eclipsing planet. Its light feels cleansing. Renewing. Life-giving.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT
</DIRECTION>
