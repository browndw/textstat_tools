EXT. SMITH STREET STATION -- BROOKLYN -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's very late. It's quiet. Just the sounds of The City
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LINDA SANTANA CRAIG, an attractive Hispanic woman in her thirties, waits at the ELEVATED STATION for the F train.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Linda looks great. She's dressed festively but tastefully. Next to her is her eleven year old DAUGHTER, ALICIA. She is twirling about the platform, still jazzed from the birthday party they attended in The City.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alicia wears a black dress with a pink cardigan and has a pink handbag. We notice a CHARM BRACELET with four-leaf clovers on her right wrist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The mother and daughter wait alone at one end of the station platform.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO TEENAGE BOYS wait at the other end. They speak soft, SLURRED SPANISH to each other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Linda gives the boys a glance and evaluates. She watches them as Alicia spits a wad of gum into her mom's open hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Boys approach. Linda tenses. At the last second the boys make a hard left turn and disappear down the stairwell. It's quiet again. Linda relaxes, smiles at her daughter. The F TRAIN is rounding the final bend into the station.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Their focus is on this train. It's getting closer, louder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And so they don't see, don't hear the Boys coming back up the stairwell behind them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Not until the boys have the mother and daughter boxed in and the one who can hardly grow a mustache is showing them his gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Linda puts her arm around her daughter. Alicia looks terrified.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The train roars INTO THE STATION as Linda quickly hands over her purse, her watch. She hands over her engagement ring and her wedding band.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the boys yanks Alicia's little purse away from her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The other boy fumbles the wedding band. The ring CLANGS to the ground and rolls to a stop a few feet away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear MEN'S VOICES echoing up the stairwell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now the Boys are boxed in. And starting to panic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- THE TRAIN DOORS SLIDE OPEN --.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Boys see their way out and step into the last empty rail car, leaving the mother and daughter alone on the platform.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the window on the train, Linda stares at the boy holding her daughter's purse, her face hardening into a MASK OF CONTEMPT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boy clocks it. Who does she think she is?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- THE TRAIN DOORS BEGIN TO CLOSE --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When a HAND WITH TATTOOED KNUCKLES reaches out and stops the car doors from closing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A forearm and gun extend out of that last subway car ... There's a muzzle flash... a distant POP... a cloud of smoke ... a mist of blood... and Linda's body collapses on itself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alicia's face, shock, terror and blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SMITH STREET STATION -- LATER THAT NIGHT -- M.O.S
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A WORKING CRIME SCENE, lots of uniforms and light, a white sheet draped over Linda's body where it fell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLUE AND RED LIGHT dances against the stairwell wall where a man is taking the stairs two at a time. Late thirties, big, plain clothes, he is SERGEANT JAMES CRAIG. When he reaches the platform, he stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Craig kneels before the white sheet. Peels it back. We stay on him. We don't see what he sees. We just see how he sees it. Then he turns...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE WEDDING BAND. It's been tagged and numbered as evidence. Craig picks it right out of the chalk outline and slips it into his pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alicia, wrapped in a blanket, standing next to a round police MATRON. The Matron is tenderly trying to clean Alicia's face. Alicia locks eyes with Craig and stumbles towards him, her legs not quite working.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Craig saves her from the stumble and envelops her, lifting her as the blanket falls to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alicia makes little gasping noises. Trying to speak but can't.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Craig walking back now, carrying his entire world. He reaches the stairwell and suddenly falls to one knee. Alicia gasps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The closest UNIFORM puts a hand on his arm. A moment. Composure. A deep breath. Then as quickly as he went down, he's back up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Craig looks back now, taking it all in. Is it real? Sees all the cops looking at him, then begins down the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE DRIFT UP above the station until we find ourselves with a clear view of the southern tip of Manhattan, where the TWIN TOWERS STAND TALL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOWER EAST SIDE RAILROAD FLAT -- BEDROOM -- MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUBTITLE: "Eight Years Later"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tiny kitchen, clutter, a MESSENGER BIKE hanging from hooks on the wall, a lot of books. There is a PHONE RINGING under the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TYLER ROTH, early twenties, handsome, looking haggard. He is sitting on the floor, shirtless, bed head, wrapped in a blanket. A GUITAR is on his lap. Tyler has propped some well worn, hand written pages of MUSIC against a box of off-brand laundry detergent and is squinting at the notes, frustration etched in his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A forgettable BLONDE lies sleeping on the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler, not a born musician, is trying to teach himself one of the PHRASES OF MUSIC in front of him. He is completely lost in the moment, with DEEP GROOVES in his fingers. By the ASHTRAY next to him, we can tell he's been at this a couple of hours.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Blonde in the bed re: the ringing phone...
</DIRECTION>
<BLONDE>
<DIRECTION>
(out of it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLONDE>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler gropes around the floor with one hand until he finds the phone, simultaneously glancing at the digital clock. His eyes widen in alarm.
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(listens)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course. I'm on my way. I know...I know...I know...I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler climbs out of his blanket and yanks on a pair of dark suit pants. Before he pulls on his white undershirt we observe a TATTOO that simply says "Michael" over his heart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He searches through a beat-up chest of drawers, seeking a reasonably clean button down shirt...
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gandhi said that whatever you do in life will be insignificant but it is very important that you do it...

</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GREEN WOOD CEMETERY --BROOKLYN -- LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A cluster of MOURNERS stand before a tombstone in the distance. They are not in funeral dress, as this is not a funeral. It's a memorial.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beat up GYPSY CAB with a WEST INDIAN DRIVER pulls to a stop. From the trees and the sky we know its LATE SPRING/EARLY SUMMER. A gorgeous day.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler gets out of the cab, holding the rim of his empty coffee cup in his teeth. He sorts a rumpled wad of singles and hands some to the driver, who screeches into reverse. Time is money.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler crushes the coffee cup flat and slips it in his jacket pocket then lights up a smoke. He takes one long drag then extinguishes it and slips the butt into his pocket. He begins towards the mourners.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His mother... DIANE HOFFMAN, a beauty. Past burdens etched in the lines on her face. Dressed tastefully in expensive bohemian. She smiles like someone who's been crying but doesn't want anyone to know she has.
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
(sweetly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, your majesty. How are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm fine... you look good...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIANE>
<DIRECTION>
He kisses his mother's hand and he's moving to greet his stepfather...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LES HOFFMAN, Unruly curls streaked in gray, tweed jacket and tie. They exchange a firm handshake and muttered hellos.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The weight of Tyler's gaze falls to CAROLINE ROTH, his diminutive bespectacled, eleven year old sister. She's holding a little paper bag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She flashes him a look. He kneels besides her and whispers...
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks for organizing everybody.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
Caroline makes a face. Turns her nose away from him.
</DIRECTION>
<CAROLINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You smell like Listerine and beer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLINE>
<DIRECTION>
He snorts and kisses her cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Caroline reaches into her bag and takes out a handful of smooth white stones, on which she has painted the names: "Mom" "Tyler" "Les", "Dad", "Caroline". She begins to arrange them in a little circle on the grave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler's father...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHARLES ROTH, late fifties, breathes power, precisely dressed, two hundred dollar haircut. A predator.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>
(aside, to Tyler)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You couldn't wear a tie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler holds his father's eye.
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could have.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Charles adjusts his own collar like it's an explosive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV: The Tombstone. The four adult family members stand side- by-side. They look like strangers on the subway as Caroline sits on the ground, arranging the stones.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JUNIOR'S RESTAURANT-- BROOKLYN -- AFTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The family sits together in a booth. Tyler rolls a Bic lighter over his knuckles. Caroline draws a funny portrait of Tyler on her napkin. He is smoking nine cigarettes at once. Diane gives the menu a ridiculous amount of attention. Les is eyeing the Cheesecake. Charles subtly aligns his silverware.
</DIRECTION>
<DIANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...This is nice... I think it's nice that we still do this...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIANE>
<CAROLINE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Mom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLINE>
<DIANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I forgot. I'm trying to purge "nice" from my vocabulary. Michael would like that we still do this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIANE>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler takes out a cigarette. Lights it. Without saying a word his mother takes it and snubs it out in an empty water glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIANE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Caroline)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you tell Tyler what your art teacher said about your portrait?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIANE>
<DIRECTION>
Caroline, as bemused as an eleven year old can be, looks at her mother, then at her brother. She adopts a very motherly tone.
</DIRECTION>
<CAROLINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tyler, did I tell you what my art teacher said about my portrait?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLINE>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why no, Caroline. What did your art teacher say about your portrait?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIANE>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You two. I quit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIANE>
<DIRECTION>
She flickers a glance at her ex husband and squeezes Les' hand.
</DIRECTION>
<CAROLINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...She was very impressed. She said I captured a moment like a young James Whistler.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLINE>
<DIRECTION>
The WAITRESS brings platefuls of extravagant cheesecake to the table. Les dives in. Charles is having toast. He sips a glass of water and takes a surreptitious glance at his Patek Phillippe.
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Young Whistler... good... 'cause Whistler really fell off late in his career. He's the Michael Jackson of European art history.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She suggested your sister take Pratt's Summer Art Intensive and that's hugely prestigious.
	</DIALOGUE>

Caroline looks a bit sheepish, Tyler high fives Caroline.

Diane, again, flickers a glance at Charles.
</DIRECTION>
<CAROLINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would be the youngest one, ever, practically...

	Caroline was speaking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIANE>
<TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
(to Charles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you really this clueless? Are you really dismissing her like this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
Diane touches Caroline's hair.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Caroline is perfectly capable of speaking up if she is feeling dismissed. Caroline, are you feeling dismissed?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<CAROLINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLINE>
<CHARLES>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't mean to change the subject.

</TYLER>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me?

</CHARLES>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The subject we were discussing. What was it?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Now's not the time for your heroics Tyler
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. It's the perfect time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
Charles makes a minute adjustment to his collar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Father and son lock eyes until...
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering, to Caroline)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you need me to take you anywhere?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
Caroline shakes her head.
</DIRECTION>
<CAROLINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll stay with mom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLINE>
<DIRECTION>
Diane glares at her ex-husband.

Tyler rises and kisses his sister's forehead.
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then I'll see you after school.

</TYLER>
<CAROLINE>

He exits as Caroline sips her lemonade, avoiding everybody's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SUBWAY CAR -- JUST AFTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler standing although there are a few seats available. The car window strobes behind him. He takes off his jacket and button down and ties them both around his waist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WALL STREET COFFEE SHOP -- AFTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler in his pants and white tee shirt looks completely out of place amidst all the business types.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sits in the last booth facing the street. His tattered JOURNAL lies open in front of him, a BINDER CLIP holds his page as he works quietly crafting an entry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The HOSTESS, tired, in her 60's, slides a piece of baklava on the table as she shuffles past.
</DIRECTION>
<HOSTESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eat something.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. 4TH STREET -- JUST AFTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler and his roommate, AIDAN BREWER, 22, energetic, inappropriate, walking west towards N.Y.U. Young people in easy, summery dress. Tyler smokes. Aidan doesn't. Aidan remembers something, smirks.
</DIRECTION>
<AIDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I sold your girlfriend a toothbrush.

<TYLER>

</AIDAN>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Congratulations?
	</DIALOGUE>

<AIDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>

</AIDAN>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was unaware we had a previous business venture.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<AIDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The 'Single Lady's Universal Tote'. It's the one-night-stand travel pack for women. We throw in some make-up, toiletries, cell phone charger, cab numbers. Retail it at S19.95, maybe do an infomercial.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AIDAN>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you think women would buy this? With money?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<AIDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey one-night-stands happen... It's a part of life... like stubbing your toe. Sometimes you misjudge a corner and bend back your pinky toe, other times you wake up in a freshman dorm wearing a field hockey tee shirt wondering why your balls smell like cinnamon...
	</DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course. Yes.

</TYLER>
<AIDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't underestimate the novelty gift market. Think about it... instead of giving that token slutty friend a ten-inch purple dildo for her birthday, you hook her up with "The SLUT." Everyone has a laugh and the implication that she'll probably use it someday remains. What do you say? Are you down?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AIDAN>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm down with getting you on some sort of medication.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<AIDAN>

	OK...fine...be cynical...just remember at some point in history two people had a conversation just like this about the light bulb. One of them went on to fame and fortune and the other one probably went to work at Mickey D's or something.

INT. TOWN CAR. (DRIVING) -- LATER

<DIRECTION>
Caroline in the cavernous backseat alone. Her pink knapsack her only company.
</DIRECTION>

The Town Car stops at a crosswalk for a GROUP OF CHILDREN in jeans and tee- shirts on their way to a local Public School. Caroline sees them through the tinted glass. They couldn't see her even if they wanted to.

One girl, a focused brunette with beautiful eyes, takes notes relentlessly. She is present, absorbing the material. She raises her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Isn't that also an ethical question?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler shoots her a glance. He takes in her lovely face, her casual dress, and the CHARM BRACELET with its four leaf clovers. WE REALIZE this is Alicia "Ally" Craig, now 19.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler grimaces at the question and its implications of hope.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CENTRAL PARK -- AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the Alice in Wonderland statue where KIDS climb all over the faded bronze mushroom caps and characters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The statue is warm, the bronze absorbing the late spring sun. Tyler is perched on the Mad Hatter, his face turned towards the sun while Caroline hides with the dormouse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler lights a cigarette. AN UPTIGHT MOMMY glares at him.

	Seriously. They like this freaky poetic crap. I ran into Megan yesterday. She's bartending at Don Hill's tonight. She wants us to stop by. She practically begged me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AIDAN>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
Aidan, visibly frustrated with Tyler's reluctance, grabs the rolling ladder and pushes Tyler into the Romance novels.

<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<AIDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey nothing. You've been a ghost the past couple weeks. You never wanna go out. I'm feeling unappreciated here. I can't deal with this brooding introvert shit anymore man. I'm ready to set up an intervention.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AIDAN>
<DIRECTION>
A silent moment passes.
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You realize interventions typically discourage binge drinking?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<AIDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One drink. Come out for one drink.

</AIDAN>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When's the last time you had one drink?

<DIRECTION>
INT. DON HILL'S -- THAT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hip venue on Greenwich Street. Deejay. Music pumping. Aidan and Tyler make their way through the crowd to a congested bar where the CUTE BARTENDER is swamped.
</DIRECTION>
<AIDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Megan!
	</DIALOGUE>
</AIDAN>
<DIRECTION>
She ignores him.
</DIRECTION>
<AIDAN>

	You look great! Can I get two Heinekens?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AIDAN>
<MEGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do. Not. Speak.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEGAN>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler snorts with laughter.
</DIRECTION>
<AIDAN>

(genuine)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is she mad at me or something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AIDAN>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No no. Girls are like that when they're way into you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<AIDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AIDAN>
<DIRECTION>
Two nubile young GIRLS approach Aidan. Tap his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL_1>
<DIRECTION>
Aidan flashes a winning smile.
</DIRECTION>
<AIDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, hello...
	</DIALOGUE>
</AIDAN>
<GIRL_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could you take a picture for us?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL_1>
<DIRECTION>
She holds out her camera. Aidan hesitates, then smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<AIDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My pleasure...
	</DIALOGUE>
</AIDAN>
<DIRECTION>
The girls pose. Aidan takes the camera. Turns it around. Extends it. Smiles. And promptly SNAPS A PICTURE OF HIMSELF. He casually returns the camera to the confused young woman.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Megan returns and practically flings the beers at Aidan.
</DIRECTION>
<AIDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks. You've met my roommate...

</AIDAN>
<MEGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>

They clink bottles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GREENWICH STREET -- LATE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler and Aidan stand with the girls from Aidan's photo opportunity. All are thoroughly intoxicated. There is a knot of CLUB GOERS halfway down the block, drinking and having a fine time.
</DIRECTION>
<AIDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love this street. I love this city. Where are you guys from, again?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AIDAN>
<AIDAN_S_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miami.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AIDAN_S_GIRL>
<AIDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miami. Miami, Barcelona, Rio. New York is it, man. God broke the mold when he made this city.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AIDAN>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You ever actually been to any of those places?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<AIDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's your point?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AIDAN>
<DIRECTION>
There's a gust of wind. Aidan's girl shivers. She's wearing a tiny dress.
</DIRECTION>
<AIDAN_S_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are we doing? I'm freezing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AIDAN_S_GIRL>
<AIDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shoulda worn a jacket. Like me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AIDAN>
<DIRECTION>
O/S WE HEAR: a beer bottle crashing on the ground, and from far away a ghostly, plaintive girl's voice disappearing into the night...
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE_O_S>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Michael...Mi-i-chael!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE_O_S>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler turns towards the sound. It's as if he's trying to spot a train in the distance. His hand goes to his pocket and fishes out his pack of cigarettes.
</DIRECTION>
<AIDAN_S_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
(to Aidan)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Asshole.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AIDAN_S_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
She walks away, looking back at her friend, annoyed.
</DIRECTION>
<AIDAN_S_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you coming?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AIDAN_S_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler's Girl looks at Tyler, who is still preoccupied.
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER_S_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
(to her friend)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold on, Lauren.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER_S_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
The girls step away. Tyler's Girl appears to be trying to convince her friend to stay. Aidan watches them, hopefully.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler isn't watching them. He's watching two cool looking MUSICIANS, crossing the street with the LIGHT, carrying SOUND EQUIPMENT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A quartet of NEANDERTHALS pulls up at the light in front of them in a car, aggressive music playing. The Neanderthal at the wheel has the brilliant idea to rev his engine and lurch the car forward, startling the musicians, toying with them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MUSICIAN #1 glares, but gives no further response, he just wants to get across the street. The Neanderthal revs and lurches again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MUSICIAN #2 slams his hand on the hood of the car.
</DIRECTION>
<MUSICIAN_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's your problem?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUSICIAN_2>
<NEANDERTHAL_DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My problem? Keep your hands off my car, asshole.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEANDERTHAL_DRIVER>
<MUSICIAN_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Blow it out your ass, Guido.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUSICIAN_2>
<MUSICIAN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go back to Long Island.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUSICIAN_1>
<DIRECTION>
The car's four doors open, and the Neanderthals lope to the front of the car. The driver is holding a mini baseball bat at his side.
</DIRECTION>
<NEANDERTHAL_DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm from Queens, faggot
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEANDERTHAL_DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
A Neanderthal shoves one of the musicians, and the driver starts wailing on the other with the bat. Tyler watches as the Neanderthals overpower them. The altercation has turned into a full on assault. The Musicians are getting stomped into the pavement.
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER_S_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So we were thinking we could go...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER_S_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler walks right past the girl without even looking at her.
</DIRECTION>
<AIDAN>
<DIRECTION>
(under his breath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God damn it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AIDAN>
<DIRECTION>
Aidan runs off after Tyler.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler jumps fully into the thick of it, swinging, grabbing beefiest Neanderthal in a choke hold and pounding guy's face. He fights like a pit bull. Not feeling, not stopping.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Aidan gets punched in the face. Tyler elbows the nose of the guy who punched Aidan and it spurts blood. Then someone hits Tyler in the gut, and he doubles over and takes a knee to the chin. The musicians get back to their feet and fight back. It's a brawl.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Aidan's girl is screaming for the cops. Tyler's girl, following the instincts of the inebriated, has teetered near enough to the brawl to imperil herself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Neanderthal swings at Aidan and misses, grazing the girl. She jerks away in her high heels and crashes to the pavement, splitting her lip on impact. Tyler head butts the guy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SIDE STREET -- LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An AMBULANCE and TWO E.M.T.'S are on site.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE COMBATANTS from the brawl are lined up on the curb.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SERGEANT JAMES CRAIG, a little older and heavier than when we first met him at the train station, is standing with the Girl, who is a mess. Her nose bloody, her dress torn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Craig shields the Girl with his body, listening carefully to her and her friend as the two girls GESTURE ANGRILY at the Neanderthals. Craig's eyes flicker in the same direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Craig's PARTNER, LEO, AFRICAN AMERICAN, a few years younger, is on the radio to Dispatch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Craig snaps his fingers at one of the E.M.T.'s and receives a blanket, which he carefully wraps around the girl. Then, to his partner, indicating Tyler and Aidan...
</DIRECTION>
<CRAIG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cut those two loose.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRAIG>
<DIRECTION>
Leo puts down the handset and uncuffs the guys.
</DIRECTION>
<LEO>
<DIRECTION>
(quiet)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take a walk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEO>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler takes a beat, looking at the lineup. Aidan, rubbing his wrists, gestures "Let's go". Tyler looks at the bloodied Girl and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Craig, going through the pockets of Neanderthal #1.
</DIRECTION>
<CRAIG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anything in here that's going to stab me, Einstein?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRAIG>
<DIRECTION>
Craig finds a packet, or a vial.
</DIRECTION>
<CRAIG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice. You like to get high and hit women?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRAIG>
<DIRECTION>
Aidan gives Tyler's elbow a gentle tug. Tyler's caught up in the action.
</DIRECTION>
<NEANDERTHAL_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't even know the bitch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEANDERTHAL_1>
<DIRECTION>
Rage flickers across Craig's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Craig moves down the line to one of the musicians, going through their pockets.
</DIRECTION>
<CRAIG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about you two?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRAIG>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler, compelled, drawing closer to the action.
</DIRECTION>

	It wasn't us, man!

<CRAIG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright. That's it. Everybody goes downtown.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRAIG>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler steps forward, interrupting...
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It wasn't them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
Aidan, who has been edging away, jerks around to his friend.
</DIRECTION>
<AIDAN>

	</DIALOGUE>
</LEO>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
Craig, big angry Irish cop, turns to Tyler.
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They didn't do anything. They didn't start this. Those assholes did. Why do these guys have to go downtown?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<CRAIG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you still doing here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRAIG>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is bullshit. It was those gorillas who started this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
Craig moves slowly toward Tyler and starts going through Tyler's pockets, roughly. He finds his wallet. Starts rifling through.
</DIRECTION>
<CRAIG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Mr. Roth. What makes you think I give a shit?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRAIG>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a police officer. You're supposed to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
What the hell? Craig looks from the guy he was frisking to Tyler's girl, wrapped in a blanket. She spits blood. He turns a bit to Tyler.
</DIRECTION>
<CRAIG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a great relief to me, Mr. Roth, to know that you're on top of the situation. Now go the fuck home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRAIG>
<DIRECTION>
He turns back to work.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler looks briefly at Aidan. Aidan looks desperate "Please! Let's get out of here!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler TOUCHES CRAIG'S ELBOW.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Aidan's jaw drops. Leo takes several silent steps in. Craig looks at his own elbow then looks at Tyler. The kid must be out of his mind.
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about you do your job?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
SLAM. Craig takes Tyler's legs out, driving his face into the pavement, a GASH opens above Tyler's LEFT EYE. Tyler lies there dazed and disoriented as Craig, with one knee on Tyler's neck, crushes his face into the ground. He slaps the cuffs on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PEARL STREET LOCKUP -- AFTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Who knows what time it is. A lovely ASSORTMENT OF PERPETRATORS, Tyler and the musicians are in lockup. Everybody looks like shit. Tyler sits on a bench in the holding cell, looking quite relaxed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lock up door slides open and Aidan is returned to the perch. The ESCORTING OFFICER shouts across the din to Tyler.
</DIRECTION>
<ESCORTING_OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can have your call now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESCORTING_OFFICER>

He cups his hands to make a megaphone...

	There was no justice in that situation.

<AIDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No justice. Okay, Green Hornet ... Lantern ... Asshole. You may not be actually matriculating in school, you may be having a nice time by yourself lurking in the stacks of your book store, but I actually plan on graduating, and having a career and a wife and a girlfriend and a divorce and a mid-life stalking episode and erectile dysfunction, and I will thank you to keep your complexes and nihilistic bullshit...

Craig comes in through the kitchen door, takes off his jacket and starts washing his hands at the sink.
</DIRECTION>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll call you back. Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<DIRECTION>
Ally hangs up. Makes a quick appraisal of her dad. He has a little blood on his cuff. He splashes his face with water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On automatic pilot, Ally flips on the toaster, pours some hot coffee into a Sesame Street Mug, pours in a measured dose of brown sugar from the dispenser, then flips open a bottle of Aspirin and deposits two of the tablets into the mug.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She packs up her back pack with school stuff as Craig gulps his coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did you tell me you were going to do when things got tight?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>

The toaster dings. She extracts an English muffin and squeezes honey from a bottle shaped like a bear.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DRIVEWAY.
</DIRECTION>

Outside their red-brick row house at the end of a block of red-brick row houses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ally has her mug on the roof of the car and is searching through her bag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Craig comes around the driver's side and slides Ally her keys across the roof. She drops them in her bag.
</DIRECTION>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mrs. Lippman said she'd do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<DIRECTION>
Craig is in the driver's seat, waiting. Ally grabs her coffee mug and gets into the passenger seat. She hands him his English muffin, which he holds in his mouth as he starts the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She flips down the visor and checks her very light eye makeup.
</DIRECTION>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're exhausted. When you have a stroke I'm going to abandon you on a park bench.

INT. EXECUTIVE FLOOR -- RECEPTION -- DAY

Tyler and his messed up face on his feet in the waiting area. English Club chairs, green baize on the walls. A RECEPTIONIST types away across the room. Tyler takes out a cigarette. Lights it. Draws the ire of...

	<DIALOGUE>
	You know you can't smoke in here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_RECEPTIONIST>

Tyler looks down at a heavy crystal ash tray on the coffee table in front of him. It's clearly never been used.

<THE_RECEPTIONIST>

Tyler follows Janine down the corridor. She looks him up and down, doesn't like what she sees.

<JANINE>

INT. CAVERNOUS EXECUTIVE OFFICE -- LATER

A row of floor-to-ceiling windows blocked by vertical blinds. Sunlight glows behind them. There's a lot of leather, brass and rich wood, breathing power. There's a flat screen computer, but no personal effects anywhere.

Charles sits at his massive desk. As Tyler enters, Charles registers his injuries. A flicker of something over Charles' face. Tyler stands.

Tyler stops, catching himself, realizing the emptiness of the gesture. He looks up and sees Janine looking at him.

INT. WALL STREET COFFEE SHOP -- AFTER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler in the same booth, surrounded by a commotion of businessmen and women. He's writing in his Journal, his foot tapping fast. We see the very act of writing eases him, loosening his strangled grip on the pen, slowing down the manic rhythm of his foot.

EXT. PRIVATE SCHOOL. JUST AFTER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's just after three, Caroline emerges from school in a CLUSTER OF 6TH GRADE GIRLS. One of them dips her head towards Caroline's ear, as if to share a secret. Whatever she says makes Caroline's face crumble, almost to tears, and the girls snicker.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler hops from his perch on a parked car. His bike leans on a fire hydrant.
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
(to Caroline)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at the girls, sizing them up, and flicks his cigarette to the sidewalk, cool as hell. The girls have a group swoon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes Caroline by the elbow...
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse us, we're due in surgery.

</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
He hands her the book of Myths.
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This was my favorite book ever. Michael had it and he hit me over the head with it until I read it. Its about all these God and Goddesses who spend all of their time being jealous and petty and otherwise acting like human beings. The illustrations are amazing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>

Caroline opens the book carefully and has a peek. She smiles.

</TYLER>
<CAROLINE>

	Yeah. Other times too. Madamoiselle Fleischman had to snap her fingers at me a lot today. And everybody laughed and they all think I'm a freak of nature.

Caroline takes a brief glance over her shoulder, towards the school.

Aidan appears to have cornered a PROFESSOR on her way in or out of the building. The woman looks tired, annoyed, like she just wants to go. Aidan talks fast, even faster than usual.
</DIRECTION>
<AIDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I know by every numerical measurement I didn't pass but what I was hoping was that maybe you give me a grade on my trying to pass. My commitment to effort. My commitment to commitment...Since the semester is nearly at it's terminus.

Craig's car rolls to a stop just in front of the flags. Ally gives him a kiss on the cheek. She gets out, and walks up the stairs, right past Aidan.

A Student Hangout. The place is bustling. Numerous NYU STUDENTS move, sit, eat, lounge. Aidan scans the crowd. Tyler stands beside him looking far less enthusiastic.

	This is one of those moments I'm already regretting.

	There. The brunette.

Tyler watches her settle into a couch with a big cup of coffee.

Ally briefly looks up from her book.
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My name's Tyler Roth. I was wondering if I could bother you for a minute?

</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
He gives her a charming smile.

Ally looks at him, a little wearily, holding her place in the book.

A surprised laugh escapes from Tyler.

<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, Anonymous, do you see the guy across the room, pretending to read a text book, looking in this general direction?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
Aidan holds a MATH TEXTBOOK at an awkward angle to mask his obvious interest in Ally and Tyler's conversation.
</DIRECTION>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Subtle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have this theory that an objective third-party, having no prior contact, would be able to determine how much of an asshole he is just by looking at him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's my roommate. And I've witnessed so many glaring examples of assaholic behavior that I'm biased as a subject, but I'm convinced that he has an aura, that people can actually perceive. So, just take a good long look. And tell me what you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at Aidan, briefly, who shifts to avoid her gaze. Then she takes a peek at Tyler's profile.
</DIRECTION>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who else do you plan on asking?

She looks at him.

<TYLER>

A COMIC PORTRAIT of Diane and Les kissing in the doorway of their brownstone. Diane has a bit of a manic smile and Les is half her size.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Caroline notices her teacher staring. She doesn't like it and shifts to block her view. The teacher gently eases her back. Smiles softly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Caroline smiles back as her teacher moves across the room. Caroline has just put her pencil back to paper when...

Ally considers.

She gives him a quick but tender kiss.

She gets in the cab.

EXT. PRIVATE SCHOOL. THE LAST DAY OF SCHOOL.

Caroline exiting with the crowd. One of the Bitchy girls shoulder checks her from behind as she passes. Tyler, waiting on his perch, catches it, walks up to her.

	They have me in this art program summer thing at Pratt...

<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A thing?

</TYLER>
<CAROLINE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLINE>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me check my book. Abso-freaking- lutely. I'm camping out. I'm sleeping there the night before.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
Caroline is secretly thrilled.
</DIRECTION>
<CAROLINE>

</TYLER>
<CAROLINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yup. What are we going to do for your birthday?

INT. RAILROAD FLAT-- NIGHT -- DEEPER INTO SUMMER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ally explores Tyler's living room with a tumbler of wine. It's in a state of medium disarray. He clocks her looking.
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. But we have coasters.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't do coasters till the third date.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<DIRECTION>
She looks over his posters, pictures, etc. Tyler scans a stack of CDs, he selects Radiohead's KID A, puts it in. The hypnotic first track fills the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ally comes across a FRAMED PHOTO of a band on stage. The lead guitarist looks like Tyler with long hair.
</DIRECTION>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's Michael. My brother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He looks like you... or you look like him. Does he play around here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not any more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
Ally notices the old guitar in the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you play?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It depends who you ask.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I asked anybody?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They'd say no. I try but it turns out you need talent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what talents do you actually have?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Falconry. I come from a long line of falconers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's a lot of money in that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler smiles. He's actually a hair nervous.
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well there is one thing...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler walks to the kitchen counter where a cleaned and polished COVERED CAKE STAND sits.
</DIRECTION>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our appetizer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler lifts off the cover to reveal a GERMAN CHOCOLATE CAKE. He's written a message in the icing: "In Case Of Ast-- and then a piece has been crudely cut out. Ally's surprised.
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It used to say "In Case Of Asteroid" but I took a shower and Aidan got high.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN -- LATER THAT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ally and Tyler stand in front of a sink full of dirty dishes, up to their elbows in soapy water.
</DIRECTION>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what kind of grade did you end up with from Vogelstein?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't actually get grades.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not technically enrolled. I worked out an auditing thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. And The Strand is not a significant career choice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like the books.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
He indicates the dishes.
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't have to help me, you know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At the rate you're going, dish washing is going to be your life's vocation. I can say I knew you when.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<DIRECTION>
He flicks a bit of water on her shirt. Ally takes a beat.
</DIRECTION>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the playful, you get me all wet part? Right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
(horsing around)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You make it sound so cheap.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
Ally's not having it.
</DIRECTION>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is cheap. I've seen this scene a hundred times.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler's a little confused.
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. I didn't...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what never happens in this scene, Tyler-who-doesn't-really-go- to-school? Tyler-who-doesn't-really care-about-his-job?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler blinks helplessly.
</DIRECTION>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<DIRECTION>
An entire enormous pot of pasta water up ended on the host. Bits of spaghetti cling to him, tiny tomatoes and zucchini on his shoulders like little barnacles. He sputters and gasps and blinks.
</DIRECTION>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, that usually never happens.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<DIRECTION>
She calmly goes back to washing dishes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spaghetti guy stares at her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She gives it right back to him, 100% New York City.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In one move Tyler slings Ally over his shoulder. She grunts, unglamorously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATHROOM -- SECONDS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler bursts through the bathroom door. Ally over his shoulder. Never one to waste a moment, she uses the opportunity to check out what's in his wallet. He turns on the shower. She has his drivers licence.
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Apologize.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never. Your middle name is Keats? Your parents are pretentious as hell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler turns on the shower and tosses Ally into the water. She dances to avoid the stream. Ally grabs the portable shower head and turns it at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler jumps into the tub to avoid the spray. They wrestle for the shower head.
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Apologize.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd rather eat monkeys.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<DIRECTION>
This cracks Tyler up. He stops struggling for the shower and gasps a little with laughter, putting up his hands in surrender. Ally stands there, holding the shower head, giggling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They lock eyes for a moment. The air is charged.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ally spritzes him in the face.
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I surrender! Oh my God, you're relentless.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
He slides down the wall until he's sitting in the tub, Ally follows.
</DIRECTION>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Victory at all costs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATH TUB -- LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler and Ally lie side-by-side, drenched. Their feet hang over the edge of the tub. Tyler reaches into his pocket and removes a dripping cigarette packet. He squeezes out water.
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now... I'm furious.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
He tosses them in a waste basket.
</DIRECTION>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should quit anyway.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? Why? Are cigarettes like bad for you or something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
Ally playfully slaps him. She notices the tip of Tyler's TATTOO peeking out of his undershirt.
</DIRECTION>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that a tattoo? Let me see.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not really...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please. It's very bad ass. All that ritualistic scarring.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler peels the soaked garment off his back as Ally offers polite applause. Michael's name becomes clear. Ally takes a long look. She sees Tyler's not smiling anymore. She gets it.
</DIRECTION>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry... I didn't... I didn't realize.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him. Asking with out asking.
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He killed himself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When he was 21. He had just started working for my father.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
Ally is gently picking spaghetti and tomatoes off Tyler.
</DIRECTION>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought he was a musician.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was. But he wasn't making a living doing music and my father's a very compelling guy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mine too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<DIRECTION>
Ally looks away for a moment. Tucks a curl behind her ear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then they look at each other. Ally opens her mouth to speak.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Aidan bursts in. He's drunk, loud, wearing an Irish Flag like a cape. He carries a bottle of whiskey and a can of Guinness.
</DIRECTION>
<AIDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn, you're not naked.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AIDAN>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not Irish.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<AIDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	T, What happened in the kitchen? It looks like somebody's water broke.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(notices Ally)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AIDAN>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ally, Aidan... Aidan, Ally.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
Aidan takes Ally's hand. Kisses it.
</DIRECTION>
<AIDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't feel bad that you're more attracted to me than you are to him it happens to all of them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AIDAN>
<DIRECTION>
Ally looks at Aidan closely, trying to figure out where she knows him from, it dawns on her.
</DIRECTION>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh! You're the assaholic!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<AIDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I--
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(realizes what she said)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait. What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AIDAN>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler and Ally laugh. Aidan's too drunk to care.
</DIRECTION>
<AIDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright, you two. Up. Dressed. Let's go. "Around The World" party on the third floor... a lot of ugly but a lot more alcohol. Let's go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AIDAN>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't, I would, I'd love to, but I've gotta get home, my dad's waiting up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<AIDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ally. Ally. Listen to me, young lady. One drink. From any country. I'll even put France on the table. One drink. Your choice. And we're gone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AIDAN>
<ALLY>
<DIRECTION>
(to Tyler)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One drink?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
(to Aidan)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One drink?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<AIDAN>
<DIRECTION>
(innocent shrug)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One drink.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AIDAN>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATHROOM -- LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ally VOMITS in their toilet. Tyler holds her hair back. Aidan appears in the doorway still wearing that flag.
</DIRECTION>
<AIDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, how we doin'?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AIDAN>
<DIRECTION>
Ally tries to speak, all we hear is a series of groans. Then she dry heaves again. Tyler shoots Aidan a look.
</DIRECTION>
<AIDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? What do you want me to say? That I'm sorry? You want me to say I"m sorry? You want me to apologize for showing a nice girl a good time? Is that it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AIDAN>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler just looks at him. Aidan considers.
</DIRECTION>
<AIDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AIDAN>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tyler...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler kneels down. Ally pushes her purse at him, she looks like she's about to pass out.
</DIRECTION>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I, need, you... to call... my dad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler and Aidan share a look. Aidan shrugs.
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. OK. Sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler pulls out her cellphone - the battery is dead.
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your phone's dead. Just tell me the number and I'll call him...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler turns around to find Ally passed out on the floor. He tries to gently nudge her awake.
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ally? Ally?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<SERGEANT_CRAIG>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)

</SERGEANT_CRAIG>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CRAIG FAMILY HOME -- ALLY'S BEDROOM -- LATE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bedside clock reads 3:47. Craig is on the phone while searching through Ally's desk drawers. For anything. He finds a note book with a red cover and starts flipping through it.
</DIRECTION>
<CRAIG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...She was supposed to be back. She's not back ... call Ted Proferes ... and what's his face in the 9th...and call me back. Just do it, Leo!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRAIG>
<DIRECTION>
Craig hangs up the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He picks it up again and starts dialing, still flipping through the notebook.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT TYLER'S BEDROOM -- NEXT MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ally wakes up alone in Tyler's bed, hung over, confused, trying to put the pieces together, then she sees the clock. And a wave of panic washes over her as she jumps out of bed.
</DIRECTION>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...oh God oh God oh God oh God...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM -- LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler sleeps on the couch using Aidan's Irish Flag as a blanket. Ally comes in pulling on her shoes. Tyler stirs in time to see her run out the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CRAIG FAMILY HOME -- LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Craig sits at the table, dialing someone, anyone. Ally enters, drops her keys on the counter. Her father doesn't look at her as she pours herself a coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I'm sorry. I fell asleep...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<DIRECTION>
Craig squeezes honey into his coffee, practically strangling the Bear. Not looking at her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ally notices the red notebook on the kitchen table next to the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<CRAIG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You turned your phone off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRAIG>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I forgot to charge it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<DIRECTION>
It dawns on her...
</DIRECTION>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's mine. From my desk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<DIRECTION>
Craig says nothing. Just stirs his coffee. Ally is furious.
</DIRECTION>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How could you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<CRAIG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were gone all night. I was trying to get some information.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRAIG>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How could you go through my stuff like I'm a suspect?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<CRAIG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then stop acting like one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRAIG>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is the matter with you, Dad? You have no respect for me and the way I'm feeling, my privacy. We talked about this! You're totally paranoid...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<CRAIG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You watch your mouth!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRAIG>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't do anything. You don't go anywhere except work. You have no life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<CRAIG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My life is right here! In this house. The same place as yours. But you're spitting all over it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRAIG>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus Christ, Dad! I went on a date!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<CRAIG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I smell alcohol...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRAIG>
<DIRECTION>
Right back at him.
</DIRECTION>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So do I.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<DIRECTION>
Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<CRAIG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	THIS IS MY HOUSE!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRAIG>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	YOU WANNA BURY ME IN IT?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<DIRECTION>
CRACK! He hits her, hard, open hand, from across the width of his body. Ally is knocked off balance and hits her head on the cabinets.
</DIRECTION>
<CRAIG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ally!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRAIG>
<DIRECTION>
His face is contorted with panic and shame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ally's disoriented. Her ears are ringing. Her lip is split. A knot is starting to form where she hit her head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She straightens herself up and stares at her dad like she has no idea who he is.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Craig tries to envelop her. With a guttural snarl she pushes him away, getting a little bit of blood on his shirt. She scrambles up the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RAILROAD FLAT-- ROOFTOP -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sunshine beats down on a little make-shift rooftop hideaway, a few old beach chairs, a stereo, a weight bench. Aidan works out with an old set of dumb bells. Tyler sits on a beach chair, trying again with the guitar.
</DIRECTION>
<AIDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...So? She just left? No good bye?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AIDAN>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler nods, strumming like he's wearing boxing gloves. Aidan finishes up a set.
</DIRECTION>
<AIDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe she heard you play the guitar.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AIDAN>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were the one dumping Jello shots down her throat. You almost killed her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
Aidan lies down to do the bench press... there's a lot of weight on the bar.
</DIRECTION>
<AIDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are sins of omission and sins of commission, my friend. I've dealt with mine and I've forgiven myself... you should do the same.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AIDAN>
<DIRECTION>
Aidan lifts. It's too heavy and falls to his chest. Tyler forgoes his spotting duty, lets him struggle. Aidan strains.
</DIRECTION>
<AIDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...little help, T... little help, little help, lotta help... TYLER?!
	</DIALOGUE>

Tyler blows three perfect smoke rings. Finally he puts down the guitar and helps get the bar up. Aidan panting, rubbing his chest.

INT. RAILROAD FLAT-- LIVING ROOM -- DAY

Tyler and Aidan come into their apartment, Aidan still rubbing his chest. Ally is standing there in the middle of the living area. A packed bag at her feet, her face a mess.

Aidan sits on the couch still in his gym clothes drinking a protein shake out of a blender. Tyler comes out of his bedroom gently closing the door behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<AIDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's she doin'?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AIDAN>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's pretty shaken up.

</TYLER>

Tyler takes a seat beside him. Takes out a cigarette.
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've really got to fix that dead bolt.

</TYLER>
<AIDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My bad. Sorry.

</AIDAN>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be. You think she'll sleep?

</AIDAN>

If looks could kill...
</DIRECTION>
<AIDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too soon?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AIDAN>
<DIRECTION>
A silent moment passes.
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told her she could stay here... Are you alright with that?

</TYLER>
<AIDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As long as she needs.

<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM -- LATER THAT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler has just finished making up the ratty sofa as a bed. Ally appears from the bedroom, framed by the open door. She has slept in one of Tyler's button down shirts.
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I get you anything?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
She nods.
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be out here if you need me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ally takes off the shirt and lets it fall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stands there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TYLER'S BEDROOM -- LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We interrupt Ally and Tyler in the throes of passion. Tyler sits on the edge of the bed. Ally is on top. She kisses his neck. Suddenly, Tyler throws her to the bed. He takes control. Ally's momentarily taken aback, but doesn't stop him. There's noticeable aggression to their love-making.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the midst of everything, the pair slow almost to stopping, a caesura. They stare into each other in a moment of surprise and recognition.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then again. Young, hungry, aggressive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIME LAPSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They lie, eyes closed, almost asleep, entwined with each other. Tyler gives a little sound of contentment. Ally, in her own haze, reaches for him, her hair all over the place. Eyes still closed they fumble for each other, starting, in this dream state, to make love all over again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEDROOM -- BEFORE SUNRISE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sheets have been torn loose from the mattress. Ally lies asleep, curled in the comforter. Tyler lies awake beside her, he smokes a cigarette and watches the sky just starting to brighten.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler gets out of bed. Grabs his journal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A NOTE propped up next to the bed: "Please don't leave. I'll be back."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SIDEWALK -- LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler locking his bike outside the coffee shop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WALL STREET COFFEE SHOP -- SUNRISE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The place is empty. A few early RISERS get coffee to go. He sits in the same booth, his journal held open by the binder clip. He writes, a bag of Bialys next to him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Janine enters. Orders two coffees. She sees Tyler, smiles. She picks up her coffees and approaches him.
</DIRECTION>
<JANINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't believe you still come down here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANINE>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler looks up, grins, nods to her coffees.
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not so far. I can't believe you still get his coffee... three sugars, no milk?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<JANINE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Old habits. You're not writing anything bad about me, are you?

	Not today.

</TYLER>
<JANINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I gotta run. Early meetings.

</JANINE>

Janine turns to go, remembers something, turns back.
</DIRECTION>
<JANINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I probably won't see you before Saturday so...happy birthday.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANINE>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler nods, tries to smile. Janine glances back as she goes.
</DIRECTION>
<JANINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be sure to tell your father that you said hello.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANINE>

Tyler nods sheepishly.

Tyler returns with breakfast. From Aidan's room, a pathetic croak...
</DIRECTION>
<AIDAN_O_S>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bialy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AIDAN_O_S>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler tosses him a Bialy like he's tossing fish to a seal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ally lies on the couch. Curled in a blanket. A cup of hot tea in hand. She sips it. It stings her lip a little.

Tyler pulls his JOURNAL from his pocket. Hands it to her.

	There's a coffee shop. I brought you a Bialy.

</TYLER>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	New York is full of coffee shops.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This one was our place... Michael's and mine. We had breakfast there all the time ... Maybe not as many times as I think we did. But enough times. Anyway we ate there that morning. It was the last place I saw him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. So you go there to write? To him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe. Sometimes. I don't know. But I guess I wanted to tell him about you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
Ally is moved, you can see it in her eyes, but she chooses not to overdo it. She flips through the journal. She hands it back to him. Then out of nowhere.
</DIRECTION>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My mom was murdered eight years ago. The same year your brother died.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler is stunned.
</DIRECTION>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't need to say anything, I know you're sorry. Everyone's always sorry, you know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<DIRECTION>
He does.
</DIRECTION>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's just, I need you to know that, my dad, he's not an evil guy. I don't want you to think that because I'm here he's some kind of belligerent psychotic, he's not...I don't know, it's just recently, he seems really...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at Tyler's face. His eyes are so patient.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ally tears up.
</DIRECTION>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wounded? Our house is like the recovery room, or the critical care unit or something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler strokes her hair.
</DIRECTION>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't feel like that, though. I feel like I'm getting stronger and like I'm leaving him behind to swim in it all by himself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<DIRECTION>
She is weeping. Tyler pulls her to him doing the best he can. Holding her and kissing her hair.

Craig is working up a head of steam.
</DIRECTION>
<CRAIG>

Aidan sits in the living room, trying to assemble an IKEA television stand. A joint smolders in the ashtray. The BUZZER rings.

With Diane's knock the door swings open.

He gives her a kiss on the cheek.

	You really have to fix that door. I'm so sorry to just show up. I called but your phone was busy.

Aidan looks and realizes that the phone is indeed off the hook, as just the handset, wrapped in duct tape, is visible on top of the sofa.

Diane is pumping Ally's hand like she's drilling for oil.

<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sit down, Mom. Can I get you something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
She navigates the IKEA carnage and sits on the sofa, the joint smoldering in the ashtray in front of her. Aidan ever the gent, removes the ashtray to the window ledge.
</DIRECTION>

	Yes. Aidan, would you bring back that spliff, please?

</AIDAN>
<DIANE>
	<DIALOGUE>

She hands it back to him and Aidan and Ally climb away. Tyler sits next to his mom and lights a cigarette.

	Well, first, your sister is all excited about your birthday at the house. I wish you'd told me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIANE>

	I wish she'd told me. It was a unilateral Caroline decision. Will you make sausage and peppers?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course. Tyler, Your father is driving me crazy. I shouldn't even be discussing this with you. I can't get him to say he'll come to your sister's exhibit. Her art exhibit. He says he's in the middle of an IPO.

Tyler rubs his eyes.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler is sitting at the table in the darkened room with Ally standing behind him with her hands over his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Caroline enters from the kitchen carrying Tyler's BIRTHDAY CAKE. She has obviously decorated it herself. She has drawn (as best as she could, given the medium) the characters from the ALICE statue in frosting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It reads "A VERY MERRY UNBIRTHDAY TO YOU", and has "22" in numerical candles and "+ 1 TO UNGROW ON" written next to that.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's singing. Aidan, Ally, Diane are all singing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a flash from a camera off screen. It's Les.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Caroline puts the cake down in front of her brother and Ally takes her hands away just as they finish the song.

Tyler's face in the candlelight as he sees Caroline's efforts. He takes a huge breath...

Caroline at her desk, sketching. Her door is ajar. Ally enters, mouth agape as she lays eyes on Caroline's collection of artwork on the walls.
</DIRECTION>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<DIRECTION>
Caroline's working on a PORTRAIT OF TYLER ON A PARK BENCH, cigarette dangling from his bottom lip. A perfect rendering of a fleeting moment.
</DIRECTION>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	May I?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<DIRECTION>
Caroline shrugs. Ally looks over Caroline's shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's exactly him. It's like the cigarette is the last Coca Cola in the desert.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<DIRECTION>
Caroline smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't believe he smokes in front of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<CAROLINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry, I'm not that impressionable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLINE>
<DIRECTION>
Ally smiles. Caroline goes back to work. Ally looks around at all the portraits papering her walls. It stirs a memory.
</DIRECTION>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know when I was younger, we didn't have air conditioning in the house, so during the summer my mom and I would go to museums to cool down... she loved them all but The Met was always her favorite.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<CAROLINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mine too. The Met is one of my favorite places in the world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLINE>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So... I heard you've got an art exhibit coming up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<CAROLINE>
<DIRECTION>
(skeptical)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wanna come?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLINE>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was it that obvious? But only if you're OK with it. I don't want to impose and I'll completely understand if you don't want some random girl there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<DIRECTION>
Caroline considers this.
</DIRECTION>
<CAROLINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not random... you're Tyler's girlfriend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLINE>
<DIRECTION>
Ally has never heard anyone say it so plainly. She seems a bit perplexed, then grins. It's okay with her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RAILROAD FLAT-- LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT OF CAROLINE'S SHOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler wearing the suit we met him in, it's been dry-cleaned.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ally emerges from the bathroom, looking gorgeous in a vintage black cocktail dress and carrying a pink wrap.
</DIRECTION>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You like?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's just skip dinner and I'll tell you how great you look in like eighteen different languages.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You just want to skip dinner. I got you a tie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<DIRECTION>
She hands him a simple blue tie that matches his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was going to make a joke about how I'm not prepared for the commitment of exchanging accessories and how neck wear especially is a slippery slope, but I should probably shut up and say thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're learning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler puts on his tie in the mirror. He scowls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FOUR SEASONS RESTAURANT -- AFTER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler and Ally sip cocktails at the nicest table in the place. There's an empty seat. Tyler's eyes flicker towards the door. Twice. He touches his tie.
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you ever been here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
Ally tries to lighten his mood.
</DIRECTION>
<ALLY>
<DIRECTION>
(joking)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Every Tuesday with my pop.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<DIRECTION>
This goes right past Tyler whose eyes flicker towards the door again.
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's allowed to stand me up. But he's not allowed to stand you up. Or my sister.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler finishes his drink, signals a WAITER who glides to the table.
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll have a whiskey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get me one too...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>
Like a stealth bomber. At least this moment rescued the men from actually having to greet each other.
</DIRECTION>
<WAITER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. For the lady?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAITER>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm fine, thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<DIRECTION>
The waiter goes.
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is Alicia Craig. Ally, my father, Charles Roth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
Charles gives a courtly nod and takes her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A pleasure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RESTAURANT -- LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An empty wine bottle. Charles cuts into a one-hundred dollar steak.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're going to be a social worker?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. But with an area of focused responsibility. It's easier to find a job that way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What will your area be?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Criminal Justice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tough area.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When I was little I wanted to play first base for the Mets. I don't think it's any harder than that.

</ALLY>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad's a Yankee fan. It has something to do with the payroll.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It has to do with significant ball playing. You were a Yankees fan when you were little. You were Lou Piniella for Halloween.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Blind familial allegiance. I didn't know what overpriced, overfed, fat bastards they were.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>
(serious as a heart attack)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's fat? What Yankee is fat? Tell me.

</CHARLES>
<TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
(right back at him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a metaphor...

Charles adjusts his tie and goes back to his steak.

Tyler tries to get a word in.

<CHARLES>

	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>
Charles and Ally burst out laughing. Tyler rolls his eyes
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--TIME CUT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dessert. Ally is working on an enormous profiterole. Tyler, another whiskey.

<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twenty-two years.

</ALLY>
<DIRECTION>
His cell phone lights up. Charles gently puts his hand on hers.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you excuse me please... I'm so sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's OK.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<DIRECTION>
Charles gets up from the table. Tyler, not able to help himself, shoots him a glance. Ally clocks it.
</DIRECTION>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's just a call. He held out 'til dessert.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<DIRECTION>
Charles returns.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry...And your mother?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She passed away when I was eleven.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She was murdered. I was there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<DIRECTION>
Charles and Tyler are stunned to silence.
</DIRECTION>
<ALLY>
<DIRECTION>
(to Tyler)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never told you that part.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are you saying this now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know.

The men look at her. She's a hero.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And, here you are.

</CHARLES>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yup. Here I am.

</ALLY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CRAIG FAMILY HOME. KITCHEN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is an empty Lean Cuisine box, and two empty Beer Cans on the counter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Craig stands by the microwave as it counts down...4,3,2,1. BEEP. He removes an Eggplant Parmigiana and slides it carefully on to a waiting plate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes it, along with a fresh beer, to the living room. He sits heavily on the sofa and hits a remote, unpausing ERIN BROCKOVICH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. IN FRONT OF THE FOUR SEASONS-- LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler and Ally wait in front of the restaurant as Charles takes another call. A TOWN CAR and DRIVER wait as well.
</DIRECTION>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think he's lovely.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler puts his head in his hands.
</DIRECTION>

Charles returns. His face blank.
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't say it.

</TYLER>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to go to the office.

</CHARLES>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have somewhere else to be, Dad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
Charles adjusts his tie. Tyler loosens his.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ally is unsure where to look.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The exhibit runs til nine. You guys take the car. I'll meet you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't believe you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's all there is, Tyler.

</CHARLES>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not good enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't have to justify anything to you. Take the car. I'll get a cab. I'll meet you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>

He steps into the street to hail a cab.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler watches his dad get into a taxi, then holds the car door for Ally.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAROLINE'S ART EXHIBIT-- PRATT AUDITORIUM -- LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amateur artwork and picked over catering. The rest of the exhibitors are high school age, even a college freshman or two. They mill with their friends and families. Animated.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ally and Aidan stand before a COLLECTION OF FAMILIAR PORTRAITS (Charles reading the paper at breakfast, Les and Diane kissing, Tyler on the park bench).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Caroline sits on a catering table, Tyler next to her. She looks miserable, he looks furious. Diane bustles over with a plate of cupcakes and a big stupid grin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I brought you every flavor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIANE>
<DIRECTION>
Caroline looks once at her mom then...

<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ally...?

<DIRECTION>
INT. RAILROAD FLAT. RIGHT AFTER
</DIRECTION>

Tyler, visibly agitated, is letting Ally in the front door to the apartment. He grabs his bike off the wall.

	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have something I've got to do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<DIRECTION>
Ally reaches for his elbow. He yanks his arm away.
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you capable of taking care of yourself for an hour? Do you need me here every minute, or what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
He slams out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ally looks like she's been slapped.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHARLES'OFFICE -- RIGHT AFTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Charles in a meeting with several SUBORDINATES. Everyone is in late night disarray. They are obviously on their way to pulling an all-nighter. The door to the office flies open. Tyler barges in. Janine trailing.
</DIRECTION>
<JANINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tyler? Tyler? You can't just...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANINE>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's fine Janine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>
There is space between the two men. Tyler extends a rolled up piece of paper to his father.
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She drew you a picture.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler gestures with the portrait
</DIRECTION>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you at least want to know her? She's telling you something, Dad. She's communicating. Why aren't you riveted? Why isn't this the most important thing? At least for one night of your life?

<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've heard this song before, Tyler.

There is still distance between the two men.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who is this display for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You, Mr. Roth.

</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
Beat.

<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sit the fuck down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>
They sit.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that I love her. I love her. Good God, you toss that word around like currency. You have no idea what it means.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe not. Maybe Caroline doesn't either. Where would she have learned it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have provided her world. And yours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That does not mean you're allowed to shatter it whenever there's something better to do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who the hell do you think you're talking to? You pedaled down here on your bike for Christ's sake. You have to take care of nothing. You are responsible for no one. You're a kid. You think you're the first one to lose anything? Do you think that there is anything you feel that I haven't already felt?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<TYLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't find him. I found him. And you're so tragically blind, the rest of your children are going to hang themselves on your watch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYLER>
<DIRECTION>
Charles goes, snarling, for his son, and Tyler is more than willing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Janine and one of the Subordinates get between them.
</DIRECTION>
<JANINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop! Stop!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANINE>
<DIRECTION>
The men are pulled apart. Tyler is white and trembling with rage. Charles' face is completely dark and closed.
</DIRECTION>
<JANINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get out of here Tyler.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANINE>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler runs for the door. Stumbling over furniture, Caroline's portrait crushed under his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RAILROAD FLAT -- RIGHT AFTER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ally, still in her dress, trying to excavate an ice tray frozen in the ancient freezer. There's got to be six inches of frost in there. She starts stabbing it with a wooden spoon. As she hears the door, she turns and puts on her most blistering attitude like an overcoat. As Tyler walks into the light-- his face white with anger, practically crying-- her eyes widen...
</DIRECTION>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<DIRECTION>
She runs to him, he falls into her. He's a mess. He won't let her see his face. She pushes at his hair, trying to see and understand. He kisses her, so she won't see. Tyler is completely lost in the storm and Alicia Santana Craig is going to get him through.
</DIRECTION>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<DIRECTION>
She yanks his head up.
</DIRECTION>
<ALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLY>
<DIRECTION>
They kiss. She brings his hands up into her hair, around her face. They kiss. He kisses her like he's starved for her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:

Raucous laughter. Caroline, Tyler, Les, Ally and Aidan are in the living room playing charades.

	You're just the prettiest girl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LES>

Diane beams at him.

<AIDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holy crap. What's with all the smiling?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AIDAN>
<DIRECTION>
Caroline travels through the living room with a popsicle. She is headed for her bedroom.

<CAROLINE>

	A child could do Berlin Alexanderplatz, you spaz.

His front door is unlocked.

Tyler freezes. Takes a beat. Scans the room, silently dropping his bag. He reaches behind him for the aluminium bat against the door. Wielding it, he takes two steps into the apartment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Craig, in plain clothes, sitting on Tyler's bed, amidst the carnage of Tyler's stuff. He has been rifling through everything. The guitar is propped haphazardly against the wall.
</DIRECTION>

Craig looks up. The men lock eyes.

Craig's eyes go to the bat.

Silence, except for exertion.

Tyler rolls to one side, coughing and gagging.
