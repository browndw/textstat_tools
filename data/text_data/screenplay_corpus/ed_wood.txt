Suddenly the lid starts to creak open. A hand crawls past the edge... and then the lid slams up! Famed psychic CRISWELL pops out. Criswell, 40, peers at us intently, his gleaming eyes framed under his striking pale blonde hair. He intones, with absolute conviction:

Pacing nervously in the rain is ED WOOD, 30, our hero. Larger-than-life charismatic, confident, Errol Flynn-style handsome, Ed is a human magnet. He's a classically flawed optimist: Sweet and well-intentioned, yet doomed by his demons within.

Ed then grabs some pipe cleaners, works them into a shape, and sprints into the dressing room. He takes some green eye shadow and excitedly smears it on the pipe cleaners. Ed then hurries back out, jams the green pipe cleaners into the cut-up shoe... and it looks like a dove with an olive branch in its mouth!

INT. BELA'S HOUSE - SAME TIME

The old movie suddenly stops, and VAMPIRA appears on the TV screen. Vampira, 25, is the sexy "Creature Feature" hostess, a pale ghoul slipped into a tight black dress.

She leers in front of a corny fog-shrouded set. There is a pumpkin, a broomstick, and a sign reading "Happy Halloween."

Ed sits, waiting.

Behind the curtain, something DROPS. We hear a muffled "Shit!"

Bela flaps his cape up and down. We almost think he's going to fly.

Ed as Glen nervously ponders his response.

But suddenly -- MUSIC THUNDERS in. The movie cuts to buffalo stampeding. Bela's angry face is superimposed over this.

<DIRECTION>
ON-SCREEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Out of nowhere, CHEAP JAZZ MUSIC starts, and the movie abruptly cuts to SLEAZY STAG PARTY-STYLE FOOTAGE! A bare-chested man whips a bound woman! A woman dominates another tied to a large stick! A brunette violently rips off her dress and does a hoochie-coochie dance!
</DIRECTION>

IN THE AUDIENCE

The crowd is stunned.

Ed looks back at Georgie, who's wearing a big satisfied grin.

<ED>

	Georgie, what's with the stag footage?? You said you were cutting in establishing shots!

Ed rolls his eyes. He turns back to the movie.

INT. PARTY - LATER THAT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everybody is CELEBRATING, with a raucous party. People are boozing it up. BIG BAND MUSIC plays. Ed dances with Dolores. Paul smokes a joint. Conrad falls over a table and breaks a lamp. Bela dances happily with a cute young REDHEAD.

<DIRECTION>
We're outside a cute little Spanish bungalow house. Ed and Dolores are moving in. They lug furniture from a rented truck.

<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	From today on, our lives are different! We'll be swimming laps in the same pool Jean Harlow did.

	I don't know. It's so much money...

</ED>
<DOLORES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But Ed, we're not even married. And you don't have a job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOLORES>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you do! And anyway, I've got tons of new scripts. And now that I have a track record, studios are bound to hire me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<DIRECTION>
She just stares. Ed shrugs, semi-reassuringly.
</DIRECTION>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look on the bright side. If we miss the rent, what's the worst they can do?

INT. BUNGALOW - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The house is moved in. Ed's unkempt dogs run about. Pumped-up Ed sits on the bed typing fiendishly fast while wearing an angora sweater. A cigarette dangles from his mouth, and a bottle of booze lays in his lap. Bela sits quietly nearby.

<BELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who do I play?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELA>
<ED>

</ED>
<BELA>
<DIRECTION>
(cautious, not to offend)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... can't I play the romantic part? I'm tired of always being the bad guy. You know, back in Hungary, I played Romeo! I would like to be the lover again -- me, in a boat, with the girl...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELA>
<DIRECTION>
Ed considers this.
</DIRECTION>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. Romance, that's great! To engineer your comeback, we're gonna need a whole slate of pictures. Once "Glen Or Glenda" takes off, we'll slam you into one, then another, then another!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<BELA>
<DIRECTION>
(he smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's good. I could use the money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELA>
<ED>

	But we need to start off with a bang! Something we know the audience will want to see. Mmm. What was your biggest hit?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<BELA>
<DIRECTION>
(he thinks)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hmm... my biggest hit? That would probably be "Dracula."

</BELA>
<ED>

	Of course!

</ED>
<DIRECTION>
Ed crabs a pen and excitedly scrawls out the word "DRACULA." Bela frowns.
</DIRECTION>
<BELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those bastards at Universal. I made so much money for them, and now I can't get the time of day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELA>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So let's make another "Dracula." Let's make "The Return of Dracula"!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<BELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can't. Those sons-a-bitches control the rights.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELA>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They do? Shoot. There must be a way to get around that...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<DIRECTION>
Ed's mind is working. He holds out the paper and stares at it. Suddenly, he grins. He grabs the pen and makes a period after the "DR." It now says "DR.ACULA"
</DIRECTION>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ha-ha! Dr. Acula!

</ED>
<BELA>
	<DIALOGUE>

We're outside the imposing gates of MGM. The lion logo is overhead. Ed drives up in his dirty Nash Rambler convertible. He wears his nicest suit. Ed peers nervously at the GUARD.
</DIRECTION>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me, I'm here to see Mr. Feldman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<DIRECTION>
The Guard stares suspiciously at Ed. His filthy car is leaking oil.
</DIRECTION>
<GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's your name?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Edward D. Wood, Junior.

The man frowns. He looks through his files -- then finds a parking slip with Ed's name. He is surprised.

INT. EXECUTIVE WAITING ROOM - DAY

The room is very posh, with fancy paneling and marble floors. Ed sits nervously under posters for "GRAND HOTEL" and "QUO VADIS." Film cans labled "Glen Or Glenda" rest in his lap.

Behind a giant desk is MR. FELDMAN, a glib, thin over- caffeinated man. He jumps up, smiling.

Ed leans in.
</DIRECTION>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Mr. Feldman, I don't believe in thinking small. So I've got a whole slate of pictures for you: "The Vampire's Tomb," "The Ghoul Goes West"... and "Doctor Acula"!

<MR_FELDMAN>

	Lugosi's washed-up. What else you got?

Ed grimaces. Lugosi was 90% of his pitch. He vamps.
</DIRECTION>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... I've got another project I wasn't gonna tell you about. Lugosi's in it, but he's got a smaller part. The lead is an ingenue, a sterling young actress named Dolores Fuller. The title is "Bride Of The Atom."

<MR_FELDMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah! Atomic Age stuff, huh? I like it.

The octopus lays in a dried-up riverbed. There's only about an inch of water. Ed yells at Conrad.
</DIRECTION>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't understand! The octopus is supposed to live in a lake!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<CONRAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is kind of a stream--

Ed storms away. Conrad scratches his head.

IN A DUSTY PARKING LOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bela sits inertly in the back of an open car. He weakly hails over Ed.
</DIRECTION>
<BELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eddie, I'm so tired... I don't know if I can handle a night shoot...
	</DIALOGUE>

<ED>

	Nonsense! You look great --

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, uh, why don't you lie down and take a little nap? We'll film around you for a while.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, buddy...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<DIRECTION>
Ed smiles warmly, then walks off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bela stares after him, then absent-mindedly searches through his pockets. Finally, he finds what he's looking for -- a rubber tube. Bela looks to make sure no one's around, then ties the tube around his upper arm...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE SET - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Crew members have dammed up the end of the river, and Bunny fills it with a hose. There is now a foot of water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ed stands at the shore, admiring it.
</DIRECTION>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. This is looking good!

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Paul, where's the octopus motor?

</ED>
<PAUL_MARCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What octopus motor?

<PAUL_MARCO>

Bela stumbles up, with a dazed smile.
</DIRECTION>
<BELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's shoot this fucker! Where do I go?

</BELA>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll be fighting with the octopus.

</ED>
<BELA>

<DIRECTION>
(he points at the water)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened to the stream?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELA>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This'll look a lot better. We have to match the stock footage of the octopus underwater.

</ED>
<BELA>

	Oh, for Christ's sake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELA>

Bela rolls up his pants and wades out, into the water. He screams.
</DIRECTION>
<BELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goddamn, it's cold!

</BELA>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Once you're in it, it warms up.

	Hey, toss me that J.D.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELA>
<DIRECTION>
A crew member throws Bela a bottle of Jack Daniels.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bela pops the cap and chugs half the bottle in one swig. He licks his lips, then climbs onto the octopus.
</DIRECTION>
<BELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay! How do we turn this thing on?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELA>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bela, somebody misplaced the motor. So when you wrestle the octopus, shake the legs a bit, to make it look like it's killing you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<DIRECTION>
Bela stares, deadpan.
</DIRECTION>
<BELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know I turned down "Frankenstein"?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELA>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<BELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	After I did "Dracula," the studio offered me "Frankenstein"! But I turned it down, the part wasn't sexy enough. It was too degrading for a big star like me.

</BELA>

The crew glances at Ed.
</DIRECTION>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bela, I've got twenty-five scenes to shoot tonight.

</ED>
<BELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't let me slow you down.

<ED>

	Alright! Let's put it on film. CAMERA! SOUND!

Bela takes another swig of J.D., then throws it off-camera.
</DIRECTION>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	ACTION!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<DIRECTION>
Bela starts flailing around the octopus legs and SCREAMING in horror. This image is truly ridiculous.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ed is pleased.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Some crew members nod: Pretty good.
</DIRECTION>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And CUT!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<DIRECTION>
Everybody cheers.

Then suddenly the dam walls BURST.

WHOOSH! The water rushes from the lake and floods the park below.

Ed sees Bela slowly shuffling along. Ed runs over to him.

	</DIALOGUE>
</BELA>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Seriously. I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done for me. A great man like you shouldn't have to run around in freezing water at four in the morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<BELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, there aren't too many other fellas I'd do it for...

<ED>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wrote something special for you. I got to thinking about all the sacrifices you've made... and so I wrote you a new final speech.

</ED>

Ed hands him the paper. Bela starts reading it, as Ed watches anxiously. Bela is very touched.

Bela and Criswell are giggling.

Someone changes the record. Brassy STRIPPER MUSIC begins.

A door opens, and Ed struts out, in full gaudy drag.

Everybody turns. They start WHISTLING and HOLLARING.

Bunny runs up and sticks a dollar bill between Ed's fake tits. People LAUGH hysterically.

Dolores is appalled.

Ed shimmies to the music, blowing kisses all around. He sees Vampira and waves.

Vampira's jaw drops in recognition.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't believe it. It's him!

Ed sashays up to Bela and dances a few steps with him. The music is building to a climax. Ed hurries off to center stage -- and as the MUSIC ENDS, he does a final swing of his hips, then suddenly yanks out his teeth!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This brings down the house. Everyone STAMPS their feet and CLAPS crazily.

Ed cannot believe what he's seeing.
