The small shower presses them close. Dean's smile infects her. He leans over, they kiss. Brushing lips at first. Dean presses closer. Cindy pulls back and pivots him around until the stream of water catches his body. He leans his head back, the water pours over his hair and face. He places his hands on Cindy's hips and pulls her close to him. Cindy hands him a bar of soap. He builds a gentle lather. Cindy inches back, turns around. Dean lathers her back, slow and languid.

He washes her shoulders and neck. His hands sculpt her body and move to her breasts. No longer washing her, but molding her. Cindy looks up. His hands move to her belly. He kneels down. Cindy reaches down and lifts him up by the arms. But Dean remains where he is. He begins, on his knees, to wash the entire surface of her left thigh, knee, calf, foot. Then he moves to her right foot and up her calf, knee and thigh. Cindy releases her breath. Then, Dean's hands move up between her legs.

Cindy grabs under his armpits. He refuses, but she wins. She pivots them around again. Standing in the stream of water, Cindy washes the soap off her body, eyes closed, head back. Dean reaches for her and follows with his fingertips the flow of water down the front of her body.

She forms a quick lather in her hands. She rubs it into his chest, her strong hands making circles of suds. Dean is a tranquil participant. She lifts up his left arm, scrubs his armpit, then his right. Her hands build a lather and wash his penis. Dean catches his breath.

INT. ROMANTASUITES HALLWAY - NIGHT - PRESENT DAY

<DIRECTION>
He takes a big drink, sifts through cassettes in his bag. In the bedroom, Cindy buttons up one of Dean's big flannel shirts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She hears the music begin from the other room, knows the song - (Penny & the Quarters or Dynamite Four) It sounds really good right now. Drink in hand, she begins to sway to the rhythm. Dean peeks his head around the corner with a shit- eating grin. He starts to awkwardly dance to the music and make his way down the hallway to the bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's been years since they danced in front of each other, and it makes them a little embarrassed to be doing it now. The closer they get to each other, the less they can be seen, the less they are exposed. Soon, they are slow dancing, still holding drinks. They don't feel as vulnerable now. The cotton on Dean's robe feels good to Cindy's fingertips, she traces invisible pictures on his back. Dean burrows his nose into Cindy's neck, inhales deeply.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a knock at the door. They both wish it would go away. It doesn't.
</DIRECTION>
<DEAN>

Something about this makes Cindy laugh, Dean too. He backs away from her, slowly, as if pulled by some unseen force. The song continues as Dean opens the door and pays the ROOM SERVICE MAN. Cindy sets the table.

Dean does as he's told. They both hold on for dear life. The world spins in a frenzy. The dread on Dean's face builds to insane laughter. It is super fun. Cindy screams. Her hair snaps in her face. Then, a look of sickness steals her smile away. She wants it to stop, which, slowly, it does. She gets off first, tries to walk, but is too dizzy. She just keeps falling to the ground. Dean crawls off the merry-go round on all fours, laughing.

He sticks his finger down his throat and forces himself to vomit. The sound of it is too much for her. She gags. Side by side, they puke into the gravel. They finish their business and end up on their backs and out of breath, side by side, looking up at the stars. They are both covered in sweat. We see their breath.

Cindy ignores his taunts and pushes as hard as she can. Slowly, she begins to push Dean's hand down. Dean groans, letting her win a little. Cindy presses down with all her weight. His hand is centimeters from hitting the table. Then, he turns the tide. Cindy battles back with all the strength she can muster. Dean laughs, realizing her passion for victory. Dean pounds her hand into the table. He stands kisses his flexed bicep. Cindy lifts her hand. A fork is stuck in the back of it. She looks at it with curiosity.

She removes his hand and places it on her hip. Dean continues to kiss her neck. He slides his hand up to her breasts. Cindy turns her head in the other direction. She pushes his hand away. He brings it back aggressive. Again. Cindy squirms underneath him. He grabs her wrists and holds her arms over her head. His tongue licks Cindy from her breasts to her face. She worms her arms away and grabs onto his hair. She arches her back, looks at him through slit eyes. His pelvis pulses and he moans. He looks up at her over his brow into her desperate eyes. He springs up. Sweat beads on his forehead.

Cindy raises her hips and slips off her panties. She lifts the shirt up over her head, positions her feet on the door jam. Her arm falls over her eyes. Breathless, Dean awkwardly moves one hand up and down her bodice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He unbuckles his belt, pushes his pants and underwear down to his knees, holds himself in his hand. He lowers onto her. Cindy adjusts her legs higher. He rotates his hips, looks away in concentration. Cindy's arms move around him, grabbing the small of his arching back. His pelvis humps in a feeble performance. A small moan. Cindy's eyes press closed harder. The erratic motion slows... stops. Dean's raspy breathing. His weight covers Cindy. She opens her eyes to the ceiling.

Back against the closed door, Cindy turns the lock. Her eyes shift from despair to relief. Her gaze grows more wild. The doorknob jiggles. A secret, crazy laugh builds in Cindy that she suppresses. Dean presses his face into the bedroom door. He talks to her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the other side of the door, Cindy listens. Dean's voice cracks. A wave of confusion backs Cindy away from the door. She searches the room for an escape. There are no windows, the only way out is through the locked door. Trembling, she wraps her arms around herself. She tries to make herself as small as possible. The spaceship bed is the only place where she can disappear. She crawls underneath the covers, curls into a tight ball. Sadness lets loose. Cindy's body pulses with faint, painful tears. The black walls of the room twinkle with stars suspended in space. The cries get lost.

Drunk, Dean and Cindy make out on the street corner. It is cold enough to see their breath. Their hands caress each other, feel what is underneath the layers of clothes. Cindy makes a move. She unbuttons Dean's Pea-Coat, feels the shape of his chest, his abdomen, his back.
