SET IN: BELO QUINTO -- SOUTHEAST BRAZIL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sun is setting low over the long, curving river beside the church in Belo Quinto. Nearby, in the dark, we see an old Priest kneeling, transcribing some hidden document. He whispers the words in hushed tones as he transcribes them. Call him FATHER PABLO ALAMEIDA.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He gently takes a break and prays with his rosary, and presses it against his forehead, closing his eyes. We see his wrists are bandaged....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As his prayers echo, distorted, we...

EXT. CHURCH -- BELO QUINTO -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A large mob of devout religious natives, some carrying crucifixes, some crying. As we move into the crowd we see numerous people carrying a HUGE, LIFELIKE SIZE of the crucifixion. They chant eerily.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We move swiftly through the crowd until we pick up pace with FATHER ANDREW KIERNAN, late thirties, dark, attractive, as he moves in and around the mob in a light windbreaker and a hand-held camera. He furrows his brow...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see deformed, invalids move through the crowd praying to Jesus, some beckoning, kneeling, almost delirious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We RISE into the air as Father Kiernan makes his way into the church.....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHURCH -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kiernan walks in and sees another large mass, not quite as large, gathered around a COFFIN in the middle of the church. He moves through the crowd up to a young priest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They speak in hushed tones, in Spanish.

He motions to the casket......
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SWIFT PAN over the casket of the eerie-looking, deceased corpse of FATHER ALAMEIDA. We recognize him from opening shots, his eyes closed, his bandaged arms crossed over his chest. He is holding a black and white photo, his Bible, and his ROSARY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WWHOOOOOOSSSSH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Father Kiernan looks on, all the candles around him begin to THUMP out, a strong wind blowing in. It's immensely religious, all the members of the church knowingly CROSS themselves, chanting under their breaths.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Father Kiernan turns and sees the main tourist attraction: Standing only a matter of feet away from the casket of Alameida, a striking white, arms in the air desperately, is the statue of the VIRGIN OF GUADALUPE. Expressionless face, blank, albino eyes, standing before the church like its savior. Only one thing is strange and eerie.....ITS EYES ARE CRYING TEARS OF BLOOD, dripping down the cheeks and dripping onto its dress. Suddenly DOVES SCATTER, feathers flying. Kiernan sets down a recorder.

A few mourners cross themselves, mindful of what he is doing, shaking their heads.

<DIRECTION>
The young Priest watches in confusion as Father Kiernan moves to the statue and takes out a knife, presses it against the indentations of the statue's base, checking for fraud. It's solid stone.

CLOSE UP: A Q-Tip dips into a puddle of the WET BLOOD. He places it in a small container for later examination.

WHOOOOSSSH! A flock of DOVES spring up out of nowhere behind the statue of the Virgin, flying in all directions into the air. Kiernan watches in surprise.

She lifts the cup of coffee to her lips and then backs away. Whoa. She begins to gag. She covers her mouth, as if sickened by a stench. She sets down the cup and races out of the room --

Dull light, thick carpets. A dim environment. Father Kiernan emerges into the room, walkes up to the desk of CARDINAL HOUSEMAN, who sits behind it. Late fifties, eyes piercing, graying hair. A bold CROSS necklace hangs from his neck. A devout Catholic.

He holds up a photo of the statue. The colors are different, almost reversed.

	Those are infra-red photographs of tears. The statue is stone, therefore room temperature. And the tears show up as white because, well, because they're warm....

<DIRECTION>
Cardinal Houseman glances up at him.
</DIRECTION>
<KIERNAN>

	I know what you're thinking. But with all due respect Daniel, this isn't a fake. It's a free-standing mass of solid stone, and there is no scientific explanation.

	<DIALOGUE>
	The face of the Virgin Mary on the building?
	</DIALOGUE>

	It's an oxidation stain. Caused by rain water running down untreated side walls. Causes an optical illusion of a veiled woman...

	Yes. I was going to bring it back, obviously, but when I saw the effect it had on the people, it's amazing. It's almost like it's become a cornerstone of their faith.

</KIERNAN>
<CARDINAL_HOUSEMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(Exasperated)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Andrew, cornerstone of their faith is the Church. Not a crying statue. When you're in the field you're a representative of the Catholic church. And the congregation of the Causes of the Saints.

</CARDINAL_HOUSEMAN>
<KIERNAN>

	Yes, I'm very well aware of that. But I'm also a scientist and I observe the facts. And the facts are that this statue has tears of blood.

	In that case, you know the policy. The statue is brought back to the Vatican and we conduct expert tests. Geologists, engineers, medical examiners. We've examined 50 to 60 crying statues in the last twelve months. Not a single one of them has turned out...

She is in the bathtub, candles all around. She stares off, deep in troubled thought.

She reaches over and grabs an apple. BITES into it and sets it back down. Stares off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She dozes and lets herself sink down into the calm, soothing water. Her face slowly sinks....

.......Her image BLURS and splits in TWO, the water slightly trembling with a force...

<DIRECTION>
......WWHHOOOSSSHH!!! A powerful noise makes her JOLT out of the water with a start:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
a dove flies across the small bathroom, gracefully landing above her, looking down at her....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frankie sits up in the tub, confused and startled. She continues to stare at the dove, who stares back and then FLITTERS off.....A single feather falls into the water in front of Frankie. She furrows her brow and picks it up, examines it....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BANG!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A stronger and more malevolent force KNOCKS her back into the water with a throttled YELP!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLURRED, FRANTIC images of Frankie struggling --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--- her foot SMASHES into the faucet of the tub, sending it SMASHING to the floor, water SPRAYING out of the open tube.

Frankie continues to flail against the unseen force...

Frankie is wheeled in on a gurney by a mob of doctors, frantically racing to an ER room.

Frankie is lying on the gurney, blood covering her clothes. Her eyes stare unflinching above her, she's numb to everything. In shock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear Donna trying to get in to see Frankie. A doctor restrains her.
</DIRECTION>
<DONNA_S_VOICE>

The doctors try frantically to PUMP some life into Frankie. Her vital signs are wild, THUMP-THUMPING to different degrees.

Suddenly Frankie Paige sits BOLT UPRIGHT and lets out a WAILED SCREAM that echoes through the ER room.

She nods. But she's not. Something is bothering her. Finally she walks to the window and looks out. Sees it:

Standing on the curb across the busy street, cloaked in a bright blue raincoat, a woman is staring at Frankie, and she is holding a wrapped up baby in her outstretched hands.

	Shit....

Horns blare as cars SCREECH to a stop and just avoid hitting her. She races across the street to the woman whose face is covered by the bright blue hood of the raincoat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At THE CUT, Donna races out after Frankie, completely confused.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frankie approaches the side of the road where the baby was dropped and searches frantically. NO BABY. She does find the red blanket it was wrapped up in. Picks it up, sobbing, hopeless.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The woman stands on the curb, expressionless, unmoving. People walking by seem to only notice Frankie and they stare.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKIE>
<DIRECTION>
(To nobody in particular)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop! There's a baby!!! There's a baby!

Frankie forces a nod.

Donna sits back in silence. A long moment passes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frankie leans forward and scans the surrounding subway box. A few pedestrians sit around her. Two nuns and a priest sit nearby, engaged in a conversation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frankie thinks a beat, then sits back. Silent. We can hear the sounds of the subway on the tracks outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Donna glances at Frankie, who looks back. They look off. Frankie leans forward again and this time focuses on the priest sitting a few people down from her, talking with the nuns. We cannot hear what he is saying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. Frankie thinks. Abruptly she STANDS and walks over to the priest...

<DONNA_S_VOICE>

</PRIEST>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. She gives him a rude look.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No one can help me now. I'm fucked.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKIE>
<DIRECTION>
With that she turns swiftly to the nuns seated across from Father Derning. Reaches forward and GRABS a SILVER CROSS NECKLACE off of one of the nuns and THROWS it down the aisle, letting it skitter to the grimey floor of the train.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All chaos breaks loose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lights FLICKER on and off in a blur of confusion and NOISE as the subway JERKS to the right and left, sending people SCATTERING to the floor in fright.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frankie SLIDES down the middle of the train, reaching out for anything to stop her. She grabs a nearby rail and tries to get to her feet. The train LURCHES to the right and left again, sending people all around again. Frankie quickly reaches out with her other hand to the railing across from the other one, now she is stretched across the train, holding on desperately --

LASHING MARKS echoe through the air. Frankie SHRIEKS.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She drops to the floor in a heap of blood and pain. Sobs desperately, reaching for something to grab onto in the middle of the chaos.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally the train slows and it's over. People get to their feet, but Frankie remains in the middle of the train, on the floor, reaching out aimlessly for something or someone to help her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Donna races to Frankie, not believing her eyes: Frankie's back is covered in blood and whip marks.

	Well, you can't. You've described blood trauma to the head. Disturbing hallucinations. You're hearing voices. These could all indicate epilepsy.

Drizzle splatters against the exterior of the window next to the booth where Frankie and Father Kiernan are seated.

<FRANKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, you live in Rome?

</FRANKIE>
<KIERNAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, but I travel a great deal, so I'm rarely there.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.

A waitress has come up. Pours Kiernan some coffee. Turns to Frankie.

Coffee, honey?

	No thanks.

Waitress walks off. Kiernan and Frankie discuss.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, what brings you to Pennsylvania?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKIE>
<KIERNAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Father Derning asked us to come and speak to you, Ms. Paige.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIERNAN>
<FRANKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OUs'? What's us, I thought you were a priest?

</FRANKIE>

andrew
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
I am a priest, but I'm also an investigator. I work for a division of the Vatican called the Congregation of the Causes of the Saints.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reveals a small tape recorder and sets it on the table between them. CLICKS RECORD.
</DIRECTION>
<KIERNAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you mind if I switch this on?

</KIERNAN>
<FRANKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, go ahead.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frankie Paige.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKIE>
<KIERNAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ok......Your age?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIERNAN>
<FRANKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twenty-three.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKIE>
<KIERNAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ok, which church do you attend?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIERNAN>
<FRANKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't attend church.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKIE>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. He looks up at her.
</DIRECTION>
<KIERNAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You ARE Catholic?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIERNAN>
<FRANKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I don't go to church because I don't believe in God....
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKIE>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. Kiernan nods.
</DIRECTION>
<KIERNAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, that's really it for me. That's all I need to know, Ms. Paige.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIERNAN>
<DIRECTION>
He begins to pack up. Takes the recorder away. Frankie's confused.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKIE>
<KIERNAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Afraid so. See, stigmatics are deeply religious people.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIERNAN>
<FRANKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And there's no exceptions?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKIE>
<KIERNAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIERNAN>
<FRANKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well why do they get stigmata?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKIE>
<KIERNAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When Christ died on the cross, he died with five wounds.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Holds out photo of crucifixion)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His back was scorched by whips. There were gashes on his forehead from the crown of thorns. There were nails driven through his hands and feet. Finally, a spear, driven through his side.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIERNAN>
<DIRECTION>
Frankie listens, and we move to her hands and wrists, which she keeps hidden below the table, mindful of as he describes the wounds that she herself possess.
</DIRECTION>
<KIERNAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Throughout history, only deeply devoted people have been....afflicted of these wounds.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIERNAN>
<FRANKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKIE>
<KIERNAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There really is no satisfactory scientific explanation. All stigmatics are haunted by such intense spiritual pain. In some ways it effects them physically. They're assaulted by their own visions of evil. And they manifest this battle in their bodies. The church regards it as a gift. A gift from God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIERNAN>
<FRANKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A gift?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I give it back?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKIE>
<DIRECTION>
Kiernan barely smiles. Frankie grows serious. Looks down at her wounds.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKIE>
<DIRECTION>
(Softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, Father, could I show you these and...you tell me what you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKIE>
<KIERNAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Yes, of course.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIERNAN>
<DIRECTION>
She holds out her bandaged wrists to him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gently he reaches over and lifts up the bandages one by one, looking at the blood underneath and the stitched wounds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally he sighs and looks away. Frankie now turns her wrists OVER to reveal yet another set of blood stains. The wound goes through the wrist bone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns back to her: sees it. He is absolutely stunned. A beat. He reaches over again and gently lifts up the bandages. Sees the blood and stitched wounds. He is speechless.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up to Frankie, who stares back with pleading eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are interrupted by the Waitress who comes back with another pot of coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
waitress
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coffee honey?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frankie sighs and looks off. The waitress leaves and they are left alone. Father Kiernan is still stunned.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, what do you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKIE>
<KIERNAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doesn't really matter what I think, Ms. Paige.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIERNAN>
<FRANKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKIE>
<KIERNAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It means officially this is not a case for the church. To say that a self-confessed Athiest exhibits the wounds of Christ is a contradiction of terms.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIERNAN>
<FRANKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, you know what...here..
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKIE>
<DIRECTION>
Exasperated, Frankie reaches into her purse and throws a crumpled piece of paper across the table to him.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Read that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKIE>
<DIRECTION>
Kiernan does.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I found that on my kitchen table the other morning. Now I don't know what that says. But that handwriting is mine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKIE>
<KIERNAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's Italian. It says OSplit a piece of wood and I am there. Lift a stone and you will find me.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIERNAN>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up at her and smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<KIERNAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's beautiful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIERNAN>
<DIRECTION>
She takes the paper and crumples it angrily.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This isn't beautiful. This is a warning! It means that no matter what I do, no matter where I go, I can't escape this!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKIE>
<KIERNAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ms. Paige, I would really like to help you --
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIERNAN>
<FRANKIE>
<DIRECTION>
(Standing up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what? This is not going anywhere. You don't know what this is. You can't give me any kind of answer. Coffee's on me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKIE>
<DIRECTION>
She throws some crumpled bills onto the table and rushes out. Kiernan sits, sighing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A few moments later he looks out the window and sees FRANKIE walking down the street in the downpour, and she turns and looks back at him with a glare.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FRANKIE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DRIP. DRIP. Water plops out of the ceiling into numerous bowls that are filled to the brim with rainwater.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sitting among masses of lit candles and books, Frankie leafs through books labeled: EPILEPSY, THE STUDY OF STIGMATA, ETC.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see numerous pictures of Christ with the crown of thorns, whip marks, nails through his palms and feet.
</DIRECTION>
<KIERNAN>

	There really is no satisfactory scientific explanation. Stigmatics are deeply religious people.

	<DIALOGUE>
	We're going to do whatever we can to find out what causes this..But all things considered, I think it might explain a lot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Frankie continues to flip through books with painful, haunting photos. A tear rolls down her cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<KIERNAN>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Throughout history only people who believe in God have been afflicted. The nearer they come to God, the more open they are to the torment of their demons. The church regards it as a gift. A gift from God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIERNAN>
<DIRECTION>
We see on one page the definition of stigmata. She quickly turns the page.

She stops and slams a book shut.

Donna, Jennifer and another friend CLINK! in a toast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

	Don't worry about it. Just order another drink. I'll be right back. I'll go check it out.

Donna moves to the table that Frankie is standing by nervously, smoking a cigarette. She smiles.

	You know what's scarier than not believing in God?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKIE>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. Donna just watches her.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Believing in him. I mean, really believing in him. It's a fucking terrifying thought.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKIE>
<DONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's Friday night. I think you're taking things a little too seriously.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNA>
<FRANKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cause if there is a God, he hates me. He's ruining my life.

A couple bloodied gashes rip open on her forehead!

CA-CHANK!

BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frankie is on the floor, not wearing a crown of thorns, but feeling its pain. Blood seeps down her forehead as she SCREAMS and SHRIEKS in pain, stumbles out of the club as onlookers either make fun or just stare in horror.
</DIRECTION>
<DONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	DON'T JUST FUCKING STAND THERE! SOMEBODY CALL AN AMBULANCE!

She rushes out of the club after Frankie. Nearby, Steven is at the bar, looks behind him.

EXT. CLUB -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens and a bleeding Frankie races out into the rain, into crowds of people and pushes her way out INTO THE STREET --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's all a blur of traffic and HORNS BLARING as she races out into the maze of cars, dodging some and CRYING OUT! Blood oozes down her head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Donna races out, looking around frantically.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE STREET Frankie HOPS up onto the hood of a car, then slides off the other side, racing through the street in a daze of pain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stands still and whips her head back and forth, her face covered in wet blood and rain. Her hair matted against her head. She groans and sobs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Donna finally gathers the nerve to race out into the street and searches around. HORNS continue to blare.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Donna looks around: Frankie is nowhere to be found.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FRANKIE'S APARTMENT COMPLEX -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Father Kiernan moves to the door and BUZZES the name PAIGE. Waits. No answer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Something catches his eye. He looks up --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frankie is moving down the street toward him. She stops when she sees him. He notices the blood dripping down her face. Frowns.
</DIRECTION>
<KIERNAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ms. Paige??
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIERNAN>
<DIRECTION>
She gasps and cries, her hand goes to her head and she immediately turns and races down the street, away from him. He quickly follows --
</DIRECTION>
<KIERNAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ms. Paige!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIERNAN>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BACK ALLEY -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kiernan races through the grime and muck of a back alley, following Frankie, who is nowhere to be found. He finally reaches the clearing in the alley and stops, looking all around.
</DIRECTION>
<KIERNAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ms. Paige? MS. PAIGE!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIERNAN>
<DIRECTION>
Nearby, we see the trembling Frankie hiding behind a flight of metal stairs, her face covered in wet gore, shivering against the cold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With Kiernan, looking around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His voice echoes. Nearby, a flock of BIRDS scatter out of nowhere into a million different directions.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WWWHOOOOOSSH! A pipe BURSTS nearby and sends clouds of SMOKE shooting out into the air. Father Kiernan is startled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A wind starts and blows newspapers and various garbage EVERYWHERE, all around Father Kiernan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up as nearby a window SHATTERS and glass SHOOTS into a million pieces. He dodges it and moves deeper into the alley --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frankie stands and races away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kiernan continues looking around...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
close on a glass bottle as it is smashed --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nearby Donna stops, turns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kierna stops when he sees her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frankie is only yards away, sitting hunched on the hood of a car, digging into the metal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Father Kiernan furrows his brow and moves closer to see what she is doing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ABOVE Frankie now, we see what she is doing: With a chunk of a broken bottle, she is writing a message into the metal. It's in foreign letters. We hear the scrape of metal against metal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We also hear Frankie's voice, speaking what she is writing. But it's in ANOTHER LANGUAGE. We do not understand her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Among the wind and rain, Kiernan moves closer. Cautious.
</DIRECTION>
<KIERNAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ms. Paige?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIERNAN>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. She stops and looks at him. Stands on the hood and we realize her eyes are a striking ORANGE, her expression changed, almost demonic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It looks like a standoff. They stare at each other, neither saying a word. Finally, Frankie returns to her work, digging into the metal of the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WWHOOOOSSH!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A pipe bursts again and more SMOKE is sent out into the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kiernan moves closer, holds out a hand. We see the tape recorder from earlier: He presses RECORD.
</DIRECTION>
<KIERNAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ms. Paige.....?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIERNAN>
<DIRECTION>
She stands and SCREAMS angrily, pointing at him sharply with the broken bottle, furious --
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aalla shatteeen man beesha!!

He stares at her, stunned.

She sighs heavily, exhausted.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Frankie!!???
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNA>
<DIRECTION>
Kiernan turns and we see Donna rushing up to them, also exhausted.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standing on the car, Frankie DROPS the broken bottle and collapses onto the hood of the car, sobbing. Kiernan and Donna move to her, and help her off the car, escorting her away. Donna is overcome with concern, as is Father Kiernan.

Kiernan leaves with Father Derning. Alone, Donna reaches over and softly strokes Frankie's hair out of her face. She smiles gently.

We see a lifelike replica of JESUS, nailed to the cross. NAILS through his PALMS and FEET. Blood drips down his forehead from the crown of thorns.

Observing it, Frankie frowns.

Father Kiernan walks into the church, moves to her.

<KIERNAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good morning, Ms. Paige. You're up early.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIERNAN>
<FRANKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, I think you made a mistake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKIE>
<KIERNAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIERNAN>
<FRANKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't have stigmata. Jesus was crucified through the palms of his hand, not his wrists. Look at my wounds, they're through the wrists. So, you're wrong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKIE>
<KIERNAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, scientists have discovered that in Roman times people were crucified through the wrists, not the palms. There's no way the hands could have supported the weight of the body. So they did crucify them through the wrists.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIERNAN>
<DIRECTION>
Frankie's fascinated.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait, wait. You're telling me that every painting, every statue of Christ, and every single crucifix in the whole world is wrong?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKIE>
<KIERNAN>
<DIRECTION>
(Shaking his head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Just....inacurate. They are all impressions of the truth. Icons are meant to be inspirational.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIERNAN>
<DIRECTION>
Frankie moves away, toward the exit of the church. Kiernan stops her.
</DIRECTION>
<KIERNAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ms. Paige, there's something else you should know. The words you keep repeating that you thought were nonsense. Well it's not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIERNAN>
<DIRECTION>
She stops and watches him. Waits for what's to come.
</DIRECTION>
<KIERNAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's actually a very specific language.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIERNAN>
<FRANKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKIE>
<KIERNAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a form of Aramaic that hasn't been used for 1900 years. It's a dialect that was used in Galalei around the time of Jesus.

Frankie looks at him. Shit.

EXT. APARTMENT COMPLEX -- ROOF -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A quiet night. We find Frankie sitting in solitude on the roof, her legs dangling over the side, her hands cradling her face. She is contemplating something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her hair blows around her as she looks down at the traffic below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She takes out a small crumpled piece of paper and rereads it.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKIE>
<DIRECTION>
(VO)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Split a piece of wood and I am there. Lift a stone and you will find me.
	</DIALOGUE>

She looks off and thinks. Places the paper back inside a pocket and then slowly gets to her feet. Hops across the edge of the roof, and then disappears out of shot....

<DIRECTION>
Father Kiernan moves to the buzzer and hits the nameplate PAIGE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He waits. Nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door to the apartment complex opens and a young woman steps out. He slides inside....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FRANKIE'S APARTMENT -- MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A knock at the door. KNOCK KNOCK. Silence. The door opens and Father Kiernan enters. Looks around for any sign of Frankie. She's nowhere.
</DIRECTION>
<KIERNAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ms. Paige???
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIERNAN>
<DIRECTION>
He walks through the apartment and into the bedroom/living room.....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
in the bedroom/living room
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
he looks and sees Frankie standing by a far wall, her back to him. She is writing in deep concentration on a large, striking blue wall. Black lettering all across the wall. We recognize it from when Frankie was grinding the same letters into the hood of the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kiernan moves into the center of the room, watching Frankie.
</DIRECTION>
<KIERNAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ms. Paige???
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIERNAN>
<DIRECTION>
She doesn't acknowledge him, but keeps writing. Working like a woman possessed.....
</DIRECTION>
<KIERNAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frankie? Frankie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIERNAN>
<DIRECTION>
Kiernan takes out his hand-held camera and holds it up to the sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASH! He snaps a picture. At the wall, Frankie flinches, pauses, then resumes writing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASH! FLASH!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This obviously disturbs Frankie. She pauses and turns halfway to Kiernan, but then turns back to her mission.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We notice something is different about her. Her hair is frizzled, her face a sickly pale. Her skin on her hands and face are WRINKLED, like an old woman. Her eyes rolled back into her head. A gutteral groan rolls out of her mouth as she scribbles the foreign words.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Moving closer, Kiernan holds the camera up and FLASHES! another photo. Lowers the camera and watches Frankie with the same haunted look he watched the corpse of FATHER ALAMEIDA....
</DIRECTION>
<KIERNAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIERNAN>
<DIRECTION>
A long beat. Frankie struggles to turn around and look at him. We notice for the first time the full effect of Frankie's state. Her eyes are in the back of her head, her entire face pale and wrinkled, her lips cracked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FRANKIE/ALAMEIDA'S VOICE (Subtitled) The messenger is not important.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are shocked. The voice is not Frankie's. It is a deep, heavily- accented man's voice. Father Alameida's....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With that she turns back to her writing, scribbling the letters over and over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kiernan moves to her and FLASHES more pictures. She flinches after each FLASH, but resumes writing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASH! FLASH! FLASH!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stops, drops the marker and swiftly turns on her heels, stares across the room at a spooked Father Kiernan. Her eyes rolled in the back of her head. Her head bobbing weakly, a gutteral groan coming out of her mouth....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
......She slowly begins to walk toward Father Kiernan. As she does so, we notice she has a LIMP, as if it's an effort to move her legs. She is also HUNCHED over, grunting with each painful step.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Father Kiernan doesn't flinch as she moves toward him, and then past him.....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
.......over to her bed where she drops down onto the covers and sprawls out.....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kiernan watches as water DRIP DRIPS down from the ceiling onto her face, cleansing her wounds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her hands go to her face as the water drips down her fragile skin, over her wounds....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
......and she is back to normal vitality. She gasps, her own voice coming out of her now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kiernan watches as she opens her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I feel like my heart is breaking. Why am I so sad??
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKIE>
<DIRECTION>
She sobs desperately. Then slowly she sits up, looks around.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It smells like flowers in here....like Jasmine or rose or something....Can you smell that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKIE>
<KIERNAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes I can.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIERNAN>
<DIRECTION>
She stands and walks to the center of the room. Looks up and sees the wall full of writing. She is puzzled.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who wrote that?

</FRANKIE>
<KIERNAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You did.

Frankie sits by the window, in awe as a couple doves fly onto her hand and eat out of her palm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nearby, Kiernan has his camera set up on a tripod, FLASHING photo after photo of the writing on the blue wall. He pauses and turns to her.
</DIRECTION>
<KIERNAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frankie, would you please come over here and have a look at this?
	</DIALOGUE>

She doesn't answer. She stares at the doves, captivated by their essence.

FLASH! FLASH!

Frankie has covered the blue wall at the far end of the room in red paint, smeared all across the message.

FRANKIE/ALAMEIDA'S VOICE You are so proud of your holy abstinance--!

She hurls him across the room, sending him slamming into cabinets, knocking objects over, sending them toppling to the floor --

<DIRECTION>
FRANKIE/ALAMEIDA'S VOICE Like touching a woman would kill you! Women are joining the...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now a swift WIND blows through the room, throwing papers and furniture and other objects SLIDING and FLYING around. Frankie's hair billows around her face as she continues to assault Kiernan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FRANKIE/ALAMEIDA'S VOICE So that's why you became a priest...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kneels over, picks him up, HURLS him into a mirror, sending GLASS shattering into a million pieces. He slides to the wall, she kneels and grabs him --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FRANKIE/ALAMEIDA'S VOICE It has nothing to do with your convenient little stories!!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She throws him across the room. Everything is blowing about in the almost supernatural wind. She goes to him and picks him up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FRANKIE/ALAMEIDA'S VOICE You're so proud of your CHURCH! Of virgins...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--- and hurls him into the nearby bathroom --
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kiernan falls to the floor beside the bathtub, looks up as Frankie stalks in and kneels down in front of him. Stares at him, her eyes the fierce orange as they were before that night in the alley. Again, she just stares at him. He stares back. Eerie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She grabs him by the collar and HOISTS him through the glass of the shower, sending shards of glass EVERYWHERE. Kiernan sits up, blood dripping down his nose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
close up: a drawer as FRANKIE opens it and grabs a sharp knife --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kiernan is kneeling against a wall, trying to stand. She walks over to him and levels the knife under his chin. Looks at him with the gleam of the devil in her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FRANKIE/ALAMEIDA'S VOICE How's your faith these days, Father?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stares at her....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FRANKIE/ALAMEIDA'S VOICE How's your faith these days!?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He continues to stare.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FRANKIE/ALAMEIDA'S VOICE This is what you fucking call God!?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kiernan watches in horror as the possessed Frankie DIGS the knife into her wrist wound, sending fresh blood spilling out of it, soaking the tissue, dripping down her arm. He turns away, ill at the sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FRANKIE/ALAMEIDA'S VOICE Blood of Christ!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He can't watch as she SLITS the skin of her lower arm, creating new wounds, more blood spilling down her arm, dripping onto the floor. SCREAMS echoe out of her, she sobs and turns away, DIGGING into both wrists, the blood spewing out. Her blouse is soaked with gore.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She drops, exhausted, onto her bed in front of Kiernan, and for a silent moment she lies still.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the bed SLIDES out from under her, moved by an unseen force.....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kiernan stands, not able to take his eyes off the spectacle. Stunned.....

Frankie remains lying down, levitated in the air...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WWHOOOSH! She rises further into the air, her arms outstretched at her sides, the blood dripping down her arm....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is THROWN forward and hangs in the air, her arms up at her sides. She is being crucified in the air, her head hung, hair blowing all around her...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kiernan cautiously moves forward.....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her head rises and she looks at him. Blood pours out of her eyes, tears of blood...

Frankie's tears of blood drip down her cheeks, and she gazes at Kiernan, suspended in the air, arms at her sides.

Finally Kiernan moves to her and gently takes her in his arms, lowers her to the ground. As she lies there, unmoving, her face blood- streaked, he checks her pulse.

Kiernan sits down in front of Frankie's bed and reveals the ROSARY Frankie's mom sent her -- Father Alameida's rosary. He closes his eyes and, pressing it to his lips, prays.

They lie in the bed looking into each other's eyes. He gently strokes the hair out of her eyes. Her face is still streaked in dry blood. From her eyes, forehead.....She looks at him with sad eyes.

	<DIALOGUE>
	It's an Aramaic scroll from the 1st century, discovered near the cave of the dead sea scrolls outside Jeruselum. Alameida and I concluded that it is a gospel of Jesus Christ. In his own words: Aramaic. There are some from the Vatican who believe that this document could destroy the authority of the modern church.
