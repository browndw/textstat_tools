JUNO MacGUFF stands on a placid street in a nondescript subdivision, facing the curb. It's FALL. Juno is sixteen years old, an artfully bedraggled burnout kid. She winces and shields her eyes from the glare of the sun. The object of her rapt attention is a battered living room set, abandoned curbside by its former owners. There is a fetid-looking leather recliner, a chrome-edged coffee table, and a tasteless latchhooked rug featuring a roaring tiger.

Then she looks over and notices the FINGERNAILS of a nearby teen, who looks as nervous as she does. The girl bites her thumbnail and spits it onto the floor.

Juno looks away, but immediately notices another waiting woman, who absently scratches her arm with long fake nails. Suddenly, she sees fingernails EVERYWHERE. The receptionist clicks her nails on the front desk. Another woman blows on her fresh manicure. Everyone seems to be fidgeting with their fingers somehow. Juno suddenly looks terror-stricken...

	I couldn't do it, Leah! It smelled like a dentist in there. They had these really horrible magazines, with, like, spritz cookie recipes and bad fiction and water stains, like someone read them in the tub. And the receptionist tried to give me these weird condoms that looked like grape suckers, and she told me about her boyfriend's pie balls, and Su-Chin Kuah was there, and she told me the baby had fingernails. Fingernails!

	What does that even mean? Anyway, I got to thinking on the way over. I was thinking maybe I could give the baby to somebody who actually likes that kind of thing. You know, like a woman with a bum ovary or something. Or some nice lesbos.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNO>
<LEAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But then you'll get huge. Your chest is going to milktate. And you have to tell everyone you're pregnant.

	I know. Maybe they'll canonize me for being so selfless.

	It means they'd send annual updates, photos, let Juno know how the baby is doing as he or she grows up. Of course, Juno's legal rights would be terminated...

</GERTA>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoah. I don't want to see pictures. I don't need to be notified of anything. Can't we just kick it old school? I could just put the baby in a basket and send it your way. You know, like Moses in the reeds.

Vanessa is obviously entertaining some worse-case scenarios. Her eyes are wide and she's uncharacteristically ruffled.

<VANESSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is the baby okay?

</VANESSA>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. It's the right size and everything. I even saw its phalanges today! Check this...

She holds the ULTRASOUND up to show Vanessa and drapes her arm around her.

	Yeah. Yeah, it kind of does.

</MARK>
<VANESSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh it's just some stuff I picked up. For, you know, the baby. Babies need a lot of things. I want everything to be just right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VANESSA>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought people got all that stuff at baby showers. When my stepmom had my sister I remember she got about a million presents. They were all lame though, so I wasn't jealous.

	No, no, I don't think that, Juno. It's just that, we went through a situation before where it didn't work out.

Juno glances at Mark and again at Vanessa. Vanessa looks embarrassed.

<MARK>

	Cold feet.

	Naah. I'm already pregnant, so they figure nothing worse could happen to me. I gotta bounce anyway. It was nice seeing you guys again.

	<DIALOGUE>
	A couple of hours? Why are you going up there in the first place?

	They said they wanted to know about this stuff. They said to keep them updated, so I did!

<JUNO>

	I don't know, I just did. And while we were waiting for Vanessa, Mark and I watched The Wizard of Gore and he burned me some CDs of weird music. He's kind of cool.

A beat as Bren absorbs this.
</DIRECTION>
<BREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was a mistake, Juno. Mark is a married stranger. You overstepped a boundary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BREN>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, Bren-duhhh, I think you're the one overstepping boundaries. You're acting like you're the one who has to go through this and get huge and push a baby out of your vag for someone else. Besides, who cares if he's married? I can have friends who are married.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNO>
<BREN>

	It doesn't work that way, kiddo. You don't know squat about the dynamics of marriage.

Bleeker's mom escorts Juno wordlessly up the stairs and down the hallway to Paulie's bedroom. Juno discreetly tries to charge ahead of her, but her expanding middle prevents her from getting past Bleeker's mom. They share an extremely awkward moment wedged side-by-side in the narrow hallway.
</DIRECTION>

Bleecker's mom nudges past Juno and knocks on Bleeker's bedroom door. The door has a cheesy racecar-themed decoration hanging on it that says PAULIE'S VRROOOM! It looks like something a 5-year old might have.

<VANESSA>

Annoyed and out of ideas, Mark begins an impromptu song...

	Cute?

</JUNO>
<LEAH>

	He asked her. I heard they were going to Benihana, then the prom, then to Vijay's parents' cabin.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Bleeker told me Katrina's whole house reeks of soup!

</JUNO>
<LEAH>

	Oh, it totally does. I was there for her birthday about four years ago and it was like Lipton Landing. But you know, boys have endured worse things for nookie.

</LEAH>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's no way in hell they're having sex or even holding hands.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNO>
<LEAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wouldn't be so sure about that. He did it with you. He's a man now.

</LEAH>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, well, Bleek trusted me. We're best friends.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNO>
<LEAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you jealous? I thought you said you didn't care what he did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEAH>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not jealous, and I don't care. I just know he doesn't like Katrina and I don't think he should toy with her emotions like that. She seems so nice and all.

</JUNO>
<LEAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay Juno, I'm really convinced.
	</DIALOGUE>

</JUNO>
<BLEEKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Um, hi?

</BLEEKER>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leah just told me you were going with her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNO>

</JUNO>
<BLEEKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're mad. Why are you mad?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLEEKER>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not mad. I'm in a fucking great mood. Despite the fact that I'm trapped in a fat suit I can't take off, despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back, despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNO>
<BLEEKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Katrina's not my girlfriend! And I doubt she was actually giving you the stinkeye. She just looks like that all the time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLEEKER>
<DIRECTION>
A GIRL strides past (obviously KATRINA) with a sour look aimed squarely at Juno.
</DIRECTION>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever. Have fun at the prom with Soupy Sales. I'm sure I can think of something way more cool to do that night. Like I could pumice my feet, or go to Bren's dumb Unitarian church, or get hit by a ten-ton truck full of hot garbage juice. All those things would be exponentially cooler than going to the prom with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNO>
<DIRECTION>
She starts to walk away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bleeker takes a deep breath.
</DIRECTION>
<BLEEKER>

</BLEEKER>
<JUNO>

	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNO>
<DIRECTION>
Bleeker BRACES himself and pushes up his lab goggles.
</DIRECTION>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not how our thing works! I hurl the accusations and you talk me down, remember?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNO>
<BLEEKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not this time. You don't have any reason to be mad at me. You broke my heart. I should be royally ticked at you, man. I should be really cheesed off. I shouldn't want to talk to you anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLEEKER>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why? Because I got bored and had sex with you one day, and then I didn't, like, marry you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNO>
<BLEEKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like I'd marry you! You would be the meanest wife of all time. And anyway, I know you weren't bored that day because there was a lot of stuff on TV. The Blair Witch Project was on Starz, and you were like, "Oh, I want to watch this, but we should make out instead. La la la."
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLEEKER>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forget it, Bleek. Take Katrina the Douche Packer to the prom. I'm sure you guys will have a really bitchin' time!

Juno picks up her BACKPACK dejectedly and slides it over her shoulder. She's about to walk away, when...
</DIRECTION>
<BLEEKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait, let me take that.

</BLEEKER>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>

Juno climbs ungracefully into the van. She starts the engine, then pauses to dig through her backpack for something. She produces a brush and begins brushing her hair in the rearview mirror, examining herself self-consciously. She puts on some Dr. Pepper Lip Smacker and backs out of the driveway.

Mark opens the door. Juno stands there, looking radiantly knocked-up. She holds a stack of CDs. Mark breaks into a grin.

:SC: INT. LORING HOUSE - BASEMENT - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Lorings' basement is dank, cluttered unfinished and unattractive, much like Paulie Bleeker's. Mark pulls a chain to illuminate a bare bulb.
</DIRECTION>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Mark! Is this the baby's room? It's beautiful!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNO>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hilarious. No, I just keep all of my old comics down here, and I want to show you one of them.

<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh God, you're one of those guys...

Mark RUMMAGES through a cardboard box in the corner.

<MARK>
<DIRECTION>
(extracting a bagged COMIC from the box)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here it is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
He shows the COMIC to Juno. It's called "Most Fruitful Yuki." It depicts a pregnant JAPANESE GIRL kicking ass and taking names.
</DIRECTION>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Most Fruitful Yuki"? What is... Oh my god, she's a pregnant superhero!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNO>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Isn't that great? I got it when I was in Japan with my band. She reminds me of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
Juno examines the comic. "Most Fruitful Yuki" does resemble her.
</DIRECTION>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow, I actually feel like less of a fat dork now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNO>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Most Fruitful Yuki is bad ass, man. You should be proud to be the same condition.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>

She throws a KARATE KICK in Mark's direction with a KEE-YA!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Juno is sincerely pleased.
</DIRECTION>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, how about some tunes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNO>
<DIRECTION>
There's a battered portable CD player in the corner. Juno kneels down and pops in one of the discs.
</DIRECTION>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now this first one is kinda slow. But it's Mott the Hoople so it's still totally rad and hardcore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNO>
<DIRECTION>
Juno puts in the CD and "All The Young Dudes" fills the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mark Laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?

</JUNO>

</MARK>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNO>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, this song's older than me, if you can believe that. I danced to it at my senior prom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's almost interesting, Mark. Who did you dance with?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNO>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Her name was Cynthia Vogel and she was a good dance partner. Even let me put my hands on her butt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh man, I can just picture you slow dancing like a dork!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNO>
<DIRECTION>
She mockingly places her hands on Mark's waist and moves back and forth stiffly.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I put my hands on your waist. Then you put your arms around my neck. That's how we did it in '88.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
Mark puts his hands on what remains of Juno's waist. She drapes her arms around his neck self-consciously.
</DIRECTION>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, okay. Like this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNO>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've never been to a dance, have you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<JUNO>
<DIRECTION>
(casually defensive)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only squares and nerds go to dances.

	What are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNO>
<DIRECTION>
They SWAY slowly to the music. Juno's belly bumps up against Mark.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I feel like there's something between us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
They laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Juno rests her head on Mark's chest. They dance in silence for a few moments, then stop moving. Mark pulls Juno as close as he possibly can, given her expanding girth.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm leaving Vanessa.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<JUNO>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	What?

</JUNO>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's just not working out, but I'm getting my own place in the city... and I've got it all planned out. It's something I've wanted to do for a long time...

Juno backs away.

<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No?

</MARK>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. No, you definitely cannot do that, Mark. That's a big, fat sack of no!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNO>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the matter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This isn't what we agreed on. You guys have to take care of... this! You are the chosen custodians of the big-ass bump!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNO>
<DIRECTION>
She GESTURES wildly to her belly. Suddenly, something matters to her far more than the approval of an older guy.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I thought you'd be cool if...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<JUNO>
<DIRECTION>
(interrupting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want you guys to adopt the Buglet. I wanted everything to be perfect. Not shitty and broken like everyone else's family. Listen, once I have the baby, Vanessa is going to finally be happy, and everything will be all right. Believe me on this one!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNO>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A baby is not going to fix everything. Besides, I don't know if I'm ready to be a father.

</MARK>
<JUNO>

	<DIALOGUE>
	But you're old!

	I... How do you think of me, Juno? Why are you here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. I just liked being your friend. I sort of liked becoming furniture in your weird life.

(he gestures to the

room)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...this is what my life has become. Stuff in boxes. Stuff underground. Is that so appealing to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I guess... Is this my fault? Is Vanessa mad at you because of me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNO>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not the point. We're just not in love anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but didn't you love Vanessa when you married her? If you love someone once, you can love them again, I know it. My friend Leah has gone out with the same guy, like, four times. You're just not trying.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNO>
<DIRECTION>
Mark suddenly sees Juno for what she is -- a teenage girl.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm such an idiot. I can't believe what an idiot I am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
He paces over to the wall and KICKS it softly.
</DIRECTION>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please don't get a divorce! God, Mark, just do me a solid and stay with your wife.

</JUNO>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God, you're so young.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not really. I'm sixteen. I'm old enough to tell when people are acting like total a-holes!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNO>
<DIRECTION>
Juno turns to leave, then shoots one furious look back at Mark.
</DIRECTION>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh and by the way, I bought another Sonic Youth album and it's the worst thing I've ever heard! It's just noise, man!

It's obvious from Juno's tears and flushed face that she's lying. Vanessa instantly goes pale with fear, but she tries her hardest to seem serene and "together" in front of Juno.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Mark? Why is Juno crying?

</VANESSA>
<JUNO>

</VANESSA>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's hormonal. Right, June? It's just part of the whole process.

Juno looks totally betrayed. She doesn't respond. Vanessa looks at Juno's expression and knows Mark is lying.

</VANESSA>

</MARK>
<VANESSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course we're ready. We've taken all the classes. The nursery. The books --

	I know we're prepared. I just don't know if... I'm ready.

Juno's face continues to fall. Vanessa notices.
</DIRECTION>
<VANESSA>
<DIRECTION>
(to Juno)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Juno, don't worry about this. He just has cold feet. That's how boys are. The books all say the same thing. A woman becomes a mother when she gets pregnant. A man becomes a father when he sees his baby. He's going to get there. He'll get there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VANESSA>
<DIRECTION>
Juno ain't buying it.
</DIRECTION>
<VANESSA>

	Why don't we let Juno go home and we can discuss this later on, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VANESSA>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It all just happened so fast. We put that ad in the paper. I thought it would take months if, you know, ever and then -- boom -- Two weeks later, she's in our living room.

<VANESSA>

	Ever since, it's just been like a ticking clock.

<DIRECTION>
This stops Vanessa. Juno looks offended.
</DIRECTION>
<VANESSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you saying?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VANESSA>
<DIRECTION>
A long hideous beat.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It just feels a little like bad timing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
Another hideous beat.
</DIRECTION>
<VANESSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What would be a good time for you?

</VANESSA>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. There's just things I still want to do.

</MARK>
<VANESSA>
	<DIALOGUE>

</VANESSA>

</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
Vanessa sighs. It's done.
</DIRECTION>
<VANESSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're trying to do something that's never going to happen. And you know what? Your shirt is stupid. Grow up. If I have to wait for you to become Kurt Cobain, I'm never going to be a mother.

Vanessa looks defeated.

Juno runs up to her car sobbing. She struggles with the keys, but finally makes it into the Previa and drives off.

The Previa slides off the road and comes to a stop on the shoulder.

Juno buckles over the steering wheel, crying, unwinding for the first time since she became pregnant.

After a beat, she begins to gather herself.

Juno lays on the hood of her Previa, contemplating her future. We push in close... when she gets an idea.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She hops off the hood and scurries into the Previa where she finds a crumpled up Jiffy Lube receipt. She unfolds it and pulls out a pen, ready to write something... a note?
</DIRECTION>

It's quiet after the storm. Inside, we see Vanessa sitting alone at her perfect dining room table, drinking a glass of wine.

<DIRECTION>
Vanessa takes a sip and continues to let the days events sink in. After a beat, Mark comes down the stairs to join her.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I called Gerta Rauss. She says she can represent both of us. They call it "collaborative divorce." It's apparently all the rage right now. And it's easy because we don't have children.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<VANESSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it's fine. Thanks for making the call, I guess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VANESSA>
<DIRECTION>
Mark nods and sits down.
</DIRECTION>
<VANESSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're actually, finally doing this?

	Looks like it, yeah.

<VANESSA>

<VANESSA>

They STARE at the wall, speechless and defeated.
</DIRECTION>
<VANESSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wanted a baby so bad. So bad.

</VANESSA>
<DIRECTION>
She buries her head in her hands.

</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
There's a LOUD KNOCK on the front door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. LORING HOUSE - ENTRY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mark opens the door. There's a folded piece of paper sitting on the doormat. He squints and sees Juno pulling away in the van.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mark carefully unfolds the piece of paper -- it takes a minute because of Juno's proficiency in "teen girl origami." He holds it up. We can see there's WRITING on the back.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It looks like a bill from Jiffy-Lube.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
Vanessa takes the note from his hand and turns it over, examining it.

	It's not easy, that's for sure. Now, I may not have the best track record in the world, but I have been with your stepmother for ten years now, and I'm proud to say that we're very happy.

<DIRECTION>
Juno nods in agreement.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In my opinion, the best thing you can do is to find a person who loves you for exactly what you are. Good mood, bad mood, ugly, pretty, handsome, what have you, the right person will still think that the sun shines out your ass. That's the kind of person that's worth sticking with.

Bleeker steps out of the house for his usual early-morning run. He looks down to see a message scrawled in chalk on the stoop: "BLEEKER -- CHECK THE MAIL."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks down to the end of the driveway and opens the latch on the mailbox.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At least one hundred containers of ORANGE TIC TACS come pouring out in an colorful deluge. They spill out onto the driveway. Bleeker smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - TRACK - MORNING

Juno waddles toward the field. The guys on the track team, ridiculously arrayed as usual, are doing hurdler stretches. They stare at her quizzically. Bleeker spots Juno approaching and jogs up to the chainlink fence.
</DIRECTION>
<BLEEKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you put like a hundred things of Tic Tacs in my mailbox?

</BLEEKER>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?

	Because they're your fave. And you can never have too much of your favorite one-calorie breath mint.

	Well... thanks. I think I'm pretty much set until college on the Tic Tac front.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLEEKER>
<JUNO>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I try really hard, actually...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLEEKER>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you're naturally smart. You always think of the funniest things to do. Remember when you passed me that postcard during Spanish class, and it was addressed like, "Junebug MacGuff, Row 4, Third Seat From the Blackboard"? And it said, "I'm having fun in Barcelona -- wish you were here"? That was hilarious.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNO>
<BLEEKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was just bored. I only think school is awesome like, 80% of the time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLEEKER>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Plus, you're the only person who doesn't stare at my stomach all the fucking time. You actually look at my face. And every time I look at you, the baby starts kicking me super hard.

<JUNO>

	P. Bleeker has just broken a district record in the 400.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNOUNCER>
<DIRECTION>
Bleeker looks out at the BLEACHERS, scanning them for Juno.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's not there.
</DIRECTION>
<JUNO>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But he figured it out anyway.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNO>
<DIRECTION>
Bleek takes off RUNNING toward the parking lot without stopping to explain. His mother stands up, confused.
</DIRECTION>

:SC: INT. HOSPITAL - MATERNITY WARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A NURSE reaches into one of the maternity ward bassinets and gently lifts up a swaddled newborn baby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The nurse turns and addresses an unseen spectator.
</DIRECTION>
<NURSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you like to meet your son?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NURSE>
<DIRECTION>
Pull back to reveal she's speaking to VANESSA, who stands, paralyzed, several feet away.
</DIRECTION>
<VANESSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have a son?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VANESSA>
<NURSE>
<DIRECTION>
(amused)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are the adoptive mother?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NURSE>
<VANESSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have a son.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VANESSA>
<NURSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Healthy kid, too. Didn't waste any time getting out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NURSE>
<DIRECTION>
Vanessa reaches out for the baby and gingerly accepts him in her eyes. She spends a few moments just looking at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She feels someone watching her, then looks up to see a Bren leaning against the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vanessa blinks away her tears self-consciously.
</DIRECTION>
<VANESSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do I look?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VANESSA>
<BREN>
<DIRECTION>
(gently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like a mom. Scared shitless.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BREN>
<DIRECTION>
Vanessa laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. HOSPITAL - BIRTHING SUITE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Juno is curled up on her bed in the birthing room. The birth is obviously over; there's that air of stillness and accomplishment, a task completed. The doctors have cleared out. Mac sits in a chair next to the bed, looking like he's not sure what to say.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He holds up a deck of Playing cards as if to initiate a game, but Juno gently pushes his hand away. Their eyes meet. His expression is helpless, hers is utterly drained.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Someday, you'll be back here, honey. On your terms.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
Juno nods and swallows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Over Mac's shoulder, a silhouette appears in the doorway. It's Bleeker in his track uniform.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Juno sees him and bursts into sudden, ragged sobs. Mac glances at her, alarmed. Paulie moves toward the bed. Mac clears his throat, gets up and leaves the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paulie climbs onto the hospital bed and carefully puts his arm around Juno. She leans into him, letting herself go for the first time in months.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - BIRTHING SUITE - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Juno lies on the bed. She looks rested and relaxed compared to her earlier crying jag, but her face is still pink and swollen. Bleeker is curled up next to her, still in his track uniform and spikes.
</DIRECTION>
<JUNO>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bleeker decided he didn't want to see the baby. Neither did I, really. He didn't feel like ours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNO>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. HOSPITAL - MATERNITY WARD - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see Vanessa leaning over the bassinet, unable to take her eyes off the baby, touching it's hair reverently.
</DIRECTION>
<JUNO>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think he was always hers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNO>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. LORING HOUSE - NURSERY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The nursery is perfectly decorated in Vanessa's immaculate taste. Nothing looks as though it's been touched. We see the antique ROCKING CHAIR sitting empty.
</DIRECTION>
<JUNO>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It ended with a chair.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNO>
<DIRECTION>
We pan past the wall Vanessa had said "needed something." There's a framed note on the wall. It looks like it was handwritten on the back of a Jiffy Lube bill. We see that it says: "Vanessa -- If you're still in, I'm still in. Juno."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We move to the door and get a view of Vanessa's bedroom. We see her lying in bed with a burp cloth draped over her shoulder, feeding the baby. For the first time ever, Vanessa looks disorganized, unshowered -- and incredibly happy. There are formula bottles on the bedside table and a bassinet pushed close to the bed. Obviously, she hasn't been away from the baby for a single moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The baby reaches up and grabs Vanessa's thumb. Vanessa glows with an expression of pure bliss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. MACGUFF HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a sparkling summer afternoon. Juno wheels her bicycle out of the detached garage. She waves goodbye to Bren, who is playing in the yard with two WEIMARANERS. She looks almost as happy with her dogs as VANESSA looked with her baby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. SUBURBAN STREETS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Juno rides her bike aggressively down the street. Her guitar is slung over her shoulder in a gig bag. She's obviously not pregnant anymore. She looks happy, but older.
</DIRECTION>
<JUNO>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As boyfriends go, Paulie Bleeker is totally boss. He is the cheese to my macaroni. I know people are supposed to fall in love before they reproduce, but normalcy's not really our style.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNO>
<DIRECTION>
As she tears recklessly down the street on her bikes, she passes the Dancing Elk TRACK TEAM, still running in outrageously skimpy shorts and bandanas.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Juno RIDES up to a garage where Bleeker is sitting, tuning his guitar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. BLEEKER HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Juno bikes up to find Bleeker sitting on the stoop. She smiles and takes out her guitar. She sits across from Bleeker and pulls the pick out of the strings.
</DIRECTION>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ready?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNO>
<DIRECTION>
Bleeker nods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Juno begins strumming her guitar and playing "Anyone Else But You," by the Moldy Peaches. Bleeker joins in. At first their playing is discordant, but suddenly it works.
</DIRECTION>
<BLEEKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a part time lover and a fulltime friend. The monkey on your back is the latest trend. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLEEKER>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here is the church and here is the steeple. We sure are cute for two ugly people. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNO>
<BLEEKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We both have shiny happy fits of rage. You want more fans, I want more stage. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLEEKER>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are always trying to keep it real. I'm in love with how you feel. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNO>
<BLEEKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train. I kiss you all starryeyed, my body's swinging from side to side. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLEEKER>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The pebbles forgive me, the trees forgive me. So why can't you forgive me? I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNO>
<JUNO_AND_BLEEKER_TOGETHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Du du du du du du dudu. Du du du du du du dudu. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNO_AND_BLEEKER_TOGETHER>
<DIRECTION>
She and Bleeker exchange glances as they play. They smile ambiguously. Juno leans over and kisses Bleeker on the cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pull out to reveal the surrounding green suburb buzzing with life and summer activity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO BLACK

THE END
