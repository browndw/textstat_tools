BAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ESTABLISHING SHOT - BLACK ROCK - PART OF TOWN: FOCAL POINT: RAILROAD STATION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
abandoned, in an extreme state of dilapidation. The structure is blistered by the resolute sun, the roof is weather-warped. Dry rot and mildew wage a relentless battle against the foundation. Between the building and the tracks is a long, somewhat narrow platform, its floorboards twisted by time, termites and the elements. The match-board overhang of the building, throwing some little shade to a portion of the platform, sags and bellies. From the overhang is appended a rectangular panel on which, in flaky paint, the town is identified:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLACK ROCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the broken wires holding the panel is longer than the other, cocking the sign irregularly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The railroad tracks reach endlessly into the horizon. Past the town on each side stretches the ocean-like prairie, with sand dunes rising and falling monotonously, shouldering each other toward infinity. The morning sun lays over this wasteland of the American Southwest, a gigantic yellow bruise from which heat waves like bloodshot arteries spread themselves over the poisoned sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small shack stands next to the station, separated from it by a narrow alleyway and leaning toward the larger building, as if for support. The words POSTAL TELEGRAPH are arced across its dusty vitrine. An old straight-backed chair, reinforced with twisted wire, is tilted against the north-west corner of the shack. In it is Mr. Hastings, the postal telegraph agent, a man of middle years and exorbitant mediocrity. He sits there spinelessly, fingering a wart on his receding chin and, once in a while, for variety, rubbing a knuckle under his watery nose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FULL SHOT - BLACK ROCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The town is minute, dismal and forgotten, crouching in isolation where the single line of railroad track intersects a secondary dirt road. The twin strips of steel glisten in the fierce sunlight, fencing the dreary plain from the false fronts of the town. In b.g. is the bluff of a black stony mountain. Against this ancient mass the houses of Black Rock's single street*** (See map, P.2A) are scanty in number and insignificant in architecture, a conglomerate paint-peeled modern trussed together with rusty nails and battered tin strips torn from signs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The town and the terrain surrounding it have, if nothing else, the quality of inertia and immutibility -- nothing moves, not even an insect; nothing breathes, not even the wind. Town and terrain seem to be trapped, caught and held forever in the sullen, abrasive earth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STRAIGHT SHOT - STREAMLINER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
jarring in its power as it ramrods across the desert, its diesel engines pounding. Its horn "WONKS" twice, blasting the shatterable air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FULL SHOT - BLACK ROCK - ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing is changed, nothing is altered. But look close and you will see a small shallow current of wind sweeping lazily across the dirt and dust of the single street. HOLD for a beat, then MAIN TITLE appears. Between the ensuing credits INTERCUT a series of sharp LONG SHOTS. The composition of each shot has that hard, sun-beaten texture of American primitive painting -- pressurized in its simplicity -- best exemplified, perhaps, by the work of Grant Wood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. SAM'S SANITARY BAR AND GRILL - ANGLE ON DOC VELIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
assayer and notary public, mortician to the citizens of Black Rock who have departed to a better place, and veterinarian to its lesser animals. An elderly, somewhat untidy gentleman, he sits nonchalantly on a chair outside the Bar & Grill. Idling with him are three or four other loafers, among them Sam, the middle-aged proprietor of the restaurant. Doc glances casually at his watch; no one else moves. The hot wind continues listlessly down the empty street.

:SC: EXT. GARAGE - LIZ BROOKS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A tall, attractive girl of twenty in dungarees and cotton shirt. She stands just outside the open barn-like door of the garage, staring, from the compulsive force of habit, at the endlessly receding tracks. The sultry wind, its gustiness slightly increased, blows through her fine dark hair.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. PORCH OF HOTEL - COLEY TRIMBLE AND HECTOR DAVID
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
two enormous men. HECTOR is tall, and there is about him a nasty, raw-boned tautness; COLEY is more the anthropoid type -- long thick arms and a round, iron casing of a belly. They glance down the street, watching incuriously a dust devil swirling in the wind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now the CAMERA has completed its probe of the town and its denizens. MAIN TITLE and CREDITS are completed...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - MR. HASTINGS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
still spineless in his chair, the chair still tilted against the shack. From o.s. and far away, we hear the horn of the streamliner -- two long "WONKS", a short and a long (engine whistle signal for approach to bridge crossing). Hastings straightens up ever so slightly as he reacts to the oncoming train.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - HASTINGS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
getting jerkily to his feet, as though charged by a galvanic current. The uncharacteristic speed of his movements throws the tilted chair to the station platform. He raises an arm to shield his watery eyes from the sun...

<DIRECTION>
SHOT - TRAIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
heading toward CAMERA, churning across the desert like a juggernaut. It PANS past CAMERA in a blur of speed. CAMERA SWINGS UP on a level with the great iron wheels as the brakes are applied. The wheels shriek agonizingly against the rails, kicking up cinders and a wild flurry of dust. She cuts speed, brakes hissing, and starts to slow down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LONG SHOT MAIN STREET - BLACK ROCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOOTING from rear of town, toward the railroad tracks. The townspeople step out, frowning, cautious, disturbed. The secure ritual of the train passing through, never stopping, has somehow, for some unknown reason, been violated.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - DOC VELIE

as his mouth tightens. His air of placidity vanishes, leaving his features disturbed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - LIZ BROOKS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her fine young face stiffens almost imperceptibly. Her eyes are coated with a vague emptiness. She seems confused as she halfturns toward the hotel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE SHOT - WHAT SHE SEES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coley Trimble and Hector David, standing on the porch of the hotel. They seem tense, responding variously to what might be fear. Coley's nostrils flare, his flat ugly mouth compresses. He looks profoundly serious. Hector wipes a glob of dusty sweat from the socket of an eye and blinks rapidly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - HASTINGS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as he stands in surprise, nervously alert, watching the train as it comes to a complete stop. His jaw droops with the slackness of fear.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. STATION PLATFORM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
with the train stationary before it. A sleek steel door of a pullman clangs open. A colored porter carrying a suitcase walks down the wrought-iron steps. He is stately, gray-haired and lean, with the almost finical tidiness travelers associate with trainmen. The man behind him is big-shouldered, a granite- like wedge of a man with calm, piercing eyes. There is about him an air of monumental dependability and quiet humor, but his eyes are those of a man who has lately lived in somber familiarity with pain. His left arm hangs from his shoulder with that lifeless rigidity of paralysis, while the hand is hidden in his pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE - MACREEDY AND PORTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The porter puts the suitcase on the platform. In the distance the town and its people are seen staring silently, motionlessly. The big man glances toward them. He smiles a sad, distasteful greeting to the town, its wretched dust. its mean, modest buildings. The porter disappears into the train as the conductor enters scene. He turns slowly, following Macreedy's gaze...

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good luck, Mr. Macreedy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONDUCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Macreedy nods his thanks. The conductor signals the engineer (o.s.) and steps on the train. The diesel's claxon blasts the torrid air ominously. The train slowly, smoothly, begins to move, picking up speed. The cars slip past until, quite suddenly, the Streamliner is gone. For a moment Macreedy watches it. Then, quite unconsciously, he takes a package of cigarettes from his left hand pocket, taps the last one free of the pack, sticks it between his lips and, crumpling the empty pack, drops it beside the tracks. He takes a cardboard book of matches, flicks it open, bends a match in half with agile fingers, and with a sure frictional motion scrapes the head against the sandpaper guard. The match flares, the cigarette is lit. Macreedy inhales, exhales deeply, and turns to pick up his suitcase. Then he sees Hastings, who walks slowly, almost painfully, to him. His Adam's apple grapples protestingly with his collar. After a moment he controls it sufficiently to talk...

With his suitcase, he cuts across a weedy path, running into Black Rock's single street. For a moment, Hastings stares after him; then he breaks hurriedly, entering telegraph agent's shack.

REVERSE SHOT - MAIN STREET - BLACK ROCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOOTING down the street as Macreedy slowly walks toward the hotel. Not a person has moved, each eye is glued on the stranger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hollow rasp of Macreedy's tread on the wooden platform of the "pavement" seems shatteringly loud in the enveloping silence...

CLOSE ANGLE - ON MACREEDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as he walks along. He feels the eyes of everyone following him, glaring at him. He halts, looks around. The townspeople continue to eye him brazenly, yet with an almost animal incuriosity. He grins and walks on past a cluster of five or six RFD mail boxes and a road sign [1], its paint peeling, its face punctured by three or four bullets from a drunk's pistol long ago.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOT - MACREEDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
heading toward the hotel. In b.g. is a relatively small farm equipment yard compressed between a general store (which Macreedy has just passed) and the hotel just ahead. In the yard are a few tractors, and among them huddles a tiny office. It is empty; the front window is thick with dust. On it, etched by an anonymous, childish finger, is a skull and crossbones. Running diagonally across is the printed legend:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
T.J. HATES J.S.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Macreedy notes the inscription with a sort of wry bemusement. He walks on, reaching the facade of the weather-beaten hotel. A gust of wind swirls down the street, momentarily engulfing Macreedy and the entire area in a sudden eddying whirlpool. As it subsides...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE - MACREEDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he peers through the dust toward the dingy hotel. It has a narrow stoop and outsize bay windows on each side. Macreedy mounts the hotel steps. At the top of the steps Coley Trimble and Hector David watch him silently. Hector is large and leanly muscular, yet Coley looms over him like a battleship. He is a gross behemoth of a man, with sharp flinty eyes the size of glistening pinpoints and a slack, oversized jaw. Both men wear modern Western work clothes, but there is one incongruous accessory which Hector affects. Around his thick wrist is a watch with a large flat face and an elaborately tooled leather strap -- a cheap reproduction of one of those expensive Swiss timepieces which, among many distinguished accomplishments, tells the day of the week, the month of the year, the phase of the moon, etc., etc.

:SC: INT. HOTEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a typical small town hotel, but crummier, with a tiny lobby. Macreedy is waiting at the empty desk as Hector strolls in, flopping his enormous bulk into a nicked and mothy chair. He picks up a newspaper, but his eyes remain on Macreedy. Macreedy waits patiently for the absent clerk. For a moment, he studies the open registration ledger; his eyes rove from the ink-splotched blotter up over the desk to one of those World War II banners, the imitation silk now stained and faded. It depicts a shrieking eagle rampant, clutching The Flag in a claw. Under it, the legend:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"GOD BLESS AMERICA"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Near it, a tacky placard proclaims:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DO ALL THE GOOD YOU CAN, BY ALL THE MEANS YOU CAN, IN ALL THE WAYS YOU CAN, AT ALL THE TIMES YOU CAN, TO ALL THE PEOPLE YOU CAN, AS LONG AS EVER YOU CAN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Feeling the eyes of Hector on him, Macreedy turns. Hector meets his gaze with bland, insolent interest. Now a young man (his name is PETE) comes out of a small room behind the registration desk and walks up to it. There is a softness about his regular features, a certain indefinable sugariness about his mouth. He seems tight-lipped, for lorn and uneasy as he faces Macreedy across the counter.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	This is 1945, mister. There's been a war on.
	</DIALOGUE>

Macreedy looks at the young man with impeccable tolerance. Without shifting his gaze, he slowly lets fall his small suitcase. It thuds softly on the frayed carpet.
</DIRECTION>
<MACREEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought it ended a couple of months ago.

</MACREEDY>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but the O.P.A. lingers on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<DIRECTION>
Macreedy looks down at the open ledger on the desk before him. The clerk reaches out to close it. Gently, yet firmly, Macreedy stops him, reopening the big book. He studies it, a finger straying unconsciously inside his collar. He [...] on it to relieve the starchy stiffness.

He draws a safety razor down his face, completing his shave; then he wipes a hand over the mirror, which clouds with steam almost as fast as he can clear it. o.s., the SOUND of bath water gurgling down the tub drain. He runs a tentative finger inside the collar of his robe, pulling loose a price tag. He drops it carefully into a wastebasket. He turns on the faucet at the sink to rinse his shaving brush. The rusty pipes cough and rumble, roaring as a trickle of water arrives while the drain sucks loudly at its departure. He dries the razor, turns off the faucet and exits.

As he walks down the dark, narrow hall. He wears the bathrobe and slippers; a large towel is draped over his head, like a prize fighter. He stops outside a door, pushes the towel from his head to his neck and puts his hand on the knob. He is about to insert the key when he tenses. Slowly, silently, he turns the knob and throws open the door.

Next to the door, in the corner of the small, sparsely furnished room is Macreedy's suitcase, open, its contents askew and scattered over the dusty floor. On the bed sprawls Hector David, his gigantic body straining the springs. He lies on his back, hands clasped easily under his head, thick legs crossed, his Stetson tilted over his low forehead. He is completely unconcerned by Macreedy's entrance. For a moment Macreedy stares at him. Then...

:SC: INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY - FULL SHOT - SAM AND THE LOAFERS

They sit around, each with his own thoughts. They are generally stolid; only Sam seems nervous. He looks up eagerly as Doc Velie enters the lobby. As he joins Sam...

Sam walks light for a big man, Doc.

Macreedy walks down the stairs. Pete looks up from the desk. He is about to dart behind the partition when...
</DIRECTION>
<MACREEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! Hold it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
He walks to the desk, smiling at Pete. In b.g., Doc, Sam and the loafers watch.
</DIRECTION>
<MACREEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Got any cigarettes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
Pete studies him, then bends under the counter, coming up with a pack. Doc leaves Sam and is slowly walking toward the stranger, eyeing him curiously.
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>

Macreedy throws the money on the desk and opens the pack, dexterously using the fingers of his left hand.

Macreedy looks at him, inhales deeply on his cigarette then, as he slowly lets the smoke out, removes the cigarette and looks at it.
</DIRECTION>
<MACREEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stale.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
Now Doc is at the desk not far from Macreedy. Macreedy starts out, then turns to Pete.

<MACREEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>

</MACREEDY>
<PETE>

Macreedy smiles and sighs tiredly. Then...
</DIRECTION>
<MACREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
(as to a child)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's put it this way -- if I had a car and if I wanted to put gas in it, where would I go?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<PETE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	But you don't have a car.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You might try the garage at the end of the street.

Macreedy pauses, looking at Doc, who blandly returns his stare.
</DIRECTION>
<MACREEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
Doc nods. Macreedy smiles and walks toward the door; Pete, Doc et al watching him. He goes out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Macreedy walks down hotel steps, a station wagon pulls up just before him. Tied with a rope to the right front fender is a magnificent eight-point buck. A stain of dry blood weaves an uneven course down his glossy flank from an unmistakable bullet hole in his shoulder. Two men get out of the car; one of them is Coley Trimble. He sees Macreedy coming toward him. He stands motionless in the center of the narrow pavement, picking at his nose with the detachment of a child. The other man is broad and excessively masculine as he swings out from behind the wheel. He walks around the car, joining Coley at the curb. Macreedy comes on. The man with Coley looks at the stranger with colossal indifference, as expressionless as the soil of Black Rock. His handsome face, under a dusty hunting cap, is taut and hard and wind-shaven. Next to Coley he stands motionless, except for the wisp of smoke from a black Cuban cigarette between his thin lips. In b.g., the loafers who had been ensconced in the hotel lobby move out the door and stand on the porch. They watch Macreedy, Coley and Reno Smith, the handsome, taut-faced man. Silence soems to settle over everything. It is Macreedy who breaks it...
</DIRECTION>
<MACREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
(grinning wearily at Coley)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here we go again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
Gently he walks around Coley and Reno Smith and continues down the street. Coley's eyes follow him. Smith goes up the steps of the hotel and enters the lobby. Coley quickly follows him. The loafers on the porch go back inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. HOTEL LOBBY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The loafers resume their familiar places as Smith walks briskly to the clerk's desk. Pete, in anticipation, opens the hotel register, places it before Smith
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>
<DIRECTION>
(deferentially,
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	gesturing toward the

open register)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's all I know about him, Mr. Smith.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<DIRECTION>
Smith doesn't answer; he looks up thoughtfully. His eyes harden almost imperceptibly as he sees Coley, across the narrow room, looking out the window after Macreedy.
</DIRECTION>
<SMITH>
<DIRECTION>
(to Coley's back)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sit down.

Coley sits in the nearest chair. Beyond Smith, still resting easily against the high counter of Pete's desk, the gigantic figure of Hector appears at the top of the stairs. He comes down and joins Smith.

He hesitates as Doc Velie sidles amiably into earshot.

</SMITH>
<DOC>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Smith looks thoughtfully out the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE SHOT - WHAT HE SEES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Macreedy, down the end of the block, saunters easily up to Liz's garage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. LIZ'S GARAGE - FULL SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The garage, without a door, opens on the street. Against the front of the building is parked a battered bicycle. On one of the barnlike walls a boy of nine is drawing laboriously with a piece of chalk. He puts the last flourish to a skull and crossbones identical with that seen earlier on the window of the equipment yard office. Macreedy stops a few feet from him, waiting until the boy prints "T.J.". As he steps back to admire his handiwork...
</DIRECTION>
<MACREEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, T.J.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
T.J. nods. He approaches the wall, raising his chalk.
</DIRECTION>
<MACREEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This your garage?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<T_J>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nope.
	</DIALOGUE>
</T_J>
<MACREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's the man it belongs to?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<T_J>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ain't a man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</T_J>
<DIRECTION>
He pauses. As Macreedy opens his mouth to interrogate further...
</DIRECTION>
<T_J>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lady runs this garage.
	</DIALOGUE>
</T_J>
<DIRECTION>
Again a pause. T.J. has just completed the final letter of the word "HATES". And again as Macreedy opens his mouth...
</DIRECTION>
<T_J>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's not here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</T_J>
<MACREEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where'd she go?

	When will she be back?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<T_J>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I dunno. Sometime.
	</DIALOGUE>
</T_J>
<DIRECTION>
Again the pause. T.J. steps back, having completed his work, which, of course, broadcasts the fact that "T.J. HATES J.S.". And again as Macreedy begins to speak...
</DIRECTION>
<T_J>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In about ten minutes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</T_J>
<MACREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
(with a grin)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
T.J. turns, pulls the bike away from the building, completes a fastidious "pony express" and peddles furiously out of scene.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. STREET - FULL SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Macreedy, after a moment's hesitation, starts down it. From the far end, at the telegraph agent's shack, a figure starts running toward Macreedy. It is Hastings. INTERCUT between the two men. Hastings, in his concentration, doesn't see the stranger until he is almost upon him. He slows down, suddenly, awkwardly, to a self-conscious walk. Macreedy grins at him, passes on, shaking his head speculatively. Hastings, with a parting glance, gallops up the hotel steps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. HOTEL LOBBY - FULL SHOT

<DIRECTION>
Smith, Coley, Hector, Pete, Doc, Sam et al are still in evidence. Smith is in a tight little group at the desk with Coley, Hector and Pete. Doc has taken a position at the window, looking out. Hastings bursts in and half-runs to Smith...

<SMITH>

	<DIALOGUE>

</DOC>
<DIRECTION>
Smith goes to the window, edging Doc to one side with a shoulder. He looks out grimly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE SHOT - WHAT HE SEES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Macreedy, down the street, cuts up the steps of the jail.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smith staring out the window with a frown. Doc watching him out of the corner of his eye, a bemused expression crossing his puckish features.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. JAIL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE on Macreedy as he enters the jail. It is small and dirty, with only a tired desk, two chairs and the usual police posters on the wall. One side leads to the cell block and Macreedy heads for it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE from interior of cell block comprising two cells, both of which are open. A man is asleep in the lower bunk of the front cell. The keys are in the lock. Macreedy shakes his head and starts to close the creaking cell door. Sheriff TIM HORN, the man in the bunk, lifts his head, blinking his bleary eyes. He is in terrible shape.
</DIRECTION>
<TIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold it, friend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIM>
<DIRECTION>
He manages to crawl off the bunk and out toward Macreedy.

The Sheriff reaches for his bottle. In his haste he drops it. Macreedy's hand moves quickly, catching the bottle before it hits the floor.

Frowning, deep in thought, Macreedy walks down the dusty street. As he reaches the hotel...

	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Macreedy.

Macreedy stops, looks toward Smith as he walks out to meet him.
</DIRECTION>
<MACREEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the friendliest word I've heard since I got here.

As Smith joins him, he walks on. Smith falls in step beside him. GO WITH THEM.

	My name is Smith. I own the Triple- Bar ranch.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to apologize for some of the folks in town.

</MACREEDY>
<SMITH>

(disarmingly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Nothing like that. We're a little suspicious of strangers is all. Hangover from the old days. The old West.

</SMITH>
<MACREEDY>

	I thought the tradition of the old West was hospitality.

	I knew a man once, lost an arm in a threshing accident. Used to hunt all the time.

</SMITH>
<MACREEDY>

(eyeing him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A man named Komako.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<SMITH>
<DIRECTION>
(no hesitation)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Komako -- Sure, I remember him -- Japanese farmer. Never had a chance.

</SMITH>
<MACREEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He got here in '41 -- just before Pearl Harbor. Three months later he was shipped to one of those relocation centers.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(shaking his head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tough.

</MACREEDY>
<SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who knows?

</SMITH>
<MACREEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think maybe if I wrote him, the letter would be forwarded?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sure it would. Write your letter. I'll see it gets out tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SMITH>
<MACREEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It wouldn't be too much trouble?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No trouble at all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SMITH>
<MACREEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Funny. Because I think it would be a great deal of trouble for you. It's been a great deal of trouble for me.

<DIRECTION>
At this point they are in front of...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. LIZ'S GARAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Macreedy stops, as does Smith. He looks keenly at Smith as he takes from his inner jacket pocket a half-dozen letters...
</DIRECTION>
<MACREEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wrote these letters to Komako. They weren't forwarded. They were returned -- address unknown.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he smiles grimly at Smith)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So I guess there's nothing you can do for me, after all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
Smith opens his mouth to reply when the NOISE of a jeep o.s. interrupts him. The jeep comes INTO SHOT. Liz Brooks, at the wheel, cuts the engine and jumps out. Smith ambles silently to a wall and leans against it. Liz reaches behind the driver's seat and hoists, with both hands and some effort, a five-gallon drum of axle grease from the floor of the jeep. As she rests it on the rear fender...
</DIRECTION>
<MACREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
(going to her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Need a little help?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>

The girl looks at Smith, who has made no attempt to help her.
</DIRECTION>
<LIZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can manage.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZ>
<DIRECTION>
She lifts the drum to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<MACREEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I need a little help.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she looks at him questioningly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like to rent your jeep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<LIZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It'll be two dollars an hour, gas extra, and ten dollars for my time.

<SMITH>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aren't you going to ask him where he wants to go?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SMITH>
<DIRECTION>
Liz looks from Smith to Macreedy, puzzled.
</DIRECTION>
<SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He wants to go to Adobe Flat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SMITH>
<DIRECTION>
Liz hesitates. Macreedy notes her confusion as her eyes seek Smith's for instructions. Quickly he moves in...
</DIRECTION>
<MACREEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The road's marked?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<LIZ>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. It's about six -- seven miles down...

</LIZ>
<MACREEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then I won't need your time.

Macreedy hands her a bill. She fumbles with it, not knowing what else to do. Her eyes drift to Macreedy's stiff arm...
</DIRECTION>
<LIZ>

(uneasily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you might... need a little help.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZ>
<MACREEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can manage.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
He steps toward the jeep as...
</DIRECTION>
<SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Liz. Do you have a license to rent cars? You could get into trouble.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SMITH>
<MACREEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all right. I won't mention it to the Sheriff.

He steps into jeep and, with one hand expertly manipulating the controls, drives off.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, what could he find out?

</LIZ>

For a moment Smith doesn't answer. Instead, with a half frown, he lifts the bill Macreedy had given her from Liz's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<SMITH>
<DIRECTION>
(as he studies it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is liable to be the hardest ten dollars you ever earned in your life.

Hastings slaps the sheet of paper in front of Smith. Utter quiet.

Tim stands facing the wall, shoulders hunched, suffering. Doc comes in and watches him silently, Tim turns, facing Doc, turns again to concentrate on a faded newspaper photograph framed and hanging on the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE - TIM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOOTING over his shoulder. Focal point: the "photograph". It shows a widly grinning, moderately alert and healthy Tim of perhaps five years ago. He is wearing, proudly, his badge of office, and behind him, mildly interested in the proceedings, is Reno Smith, his erstwhile sponsor. The heading on the photo reads: DEPUTY SHERIFF NAMED FOR BLACK ROCK.

OUT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. DESERT ROAD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An old marker, jutting on an angle at the side of the road, reads: ADOBE FLAT. Beneath it an arrow points ahead. Macreedy steers the jeep up the narrow, rutted trail between a serious of enormous boulders.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as he drives to the far end of the boulders, reaching a flat piece of land completely surrounded by rocks. Beyond the rocks is what remains of a burned-out ranch house, and an abandoned well.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. SHOT - MACREEDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
in the wreckage. The remains of an iron bed. The burned-out shell of a pick-up truck. Part of a stove. A morass of bottles, all sizes and shapes, some of them broken. Macreedy halts momentarily beside the well. Reaching out he touches the warped sun-beaten boards that cover the mouth. He removes one, and, picking up a pebble, drops it through the opening. There is a long beat and then, from far, far below we HEAR a faint PLUNK (o.s.). He replaces the board and walks to a broken wall. He touches the burned out frame of a picture. The frame falls to the ground, leaving an un-scorched square on the surface of the wall. He goes past a solitary standing stone chimney. Suddenly he halts, arrested by something among the rubble, the rottenness and the ashes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE ANGLE - WHAT HE SEES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Surrounded by the seared and blackened earth is a rectangular patch of lovely wild flowers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO MACREEDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
studying the brightly colored flowers. His face is lined in thought. He stoops, gathers a few buds in his hand. He examines them, his brow furrowed. As he slowly twirls a flower between thumb and forefinger, CAMERA PANS from Macreedy in a long slow arc, taking in miles and miles of barren wasteland. CAMERA RISES, TILTING UPWARD to a cliff far away and shielded from Macreedy's view by the intervening rocks and ridges.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXTREME LONG SHOT - CLIFF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
and on it the outline of an automobile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. SHOT - THE CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
empty. It is parked on a narrow dirt road. On one side of the road the cliff falls abruptly to the valley far below; on the other, the steep, shaly outcropping continues to rise. For a moment CAMERA HOLDS on the car. Then it PANS SLOWLY upward about fifty feet, HOLDING this time on...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PINNACLE OF CLIFF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
where a man is looking off toward Adobe Flat through a pair of high-powered glasses. The man is Coley Trimble.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ADOBE WELLS - MACREEDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grimly he walks toward the jeep, still holding the wild flowers. Now he pockets them, jumps into the vehicle and drives off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
continues to train his glasses on Macreedy far below in the moving jeep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE JEEP - MACREEDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
driving steadily over rough, rocky terrain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLEY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
climbs down from the pinnacle of the cliff and enters a big, powerful '36 Packard sedan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MACREEDY

shifts to low gear as the jeep presses into hilly country.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLEY - IN HIS CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
turns on the ignition.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MACREEDY - IN THE JEEP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as it winds along a road with the cliff rising on one side and falling off steeply on the other. He rounds a curve, passes an insignificant side road, drives on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SIDE ROAD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car with Coley at the wheel pulls out, follows Macreedy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERCUT between the two cars, with the distance between them constantly diminishing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. - FLAT ROAD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
a straightaway, cutting through rocky outcroppings on both sides. Macreedy's jeep roars by, pursued by the gaining Packard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - MACREEDY IN JEEP - (PROCESS)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For the first time he is aware that he is being followed, and that the man at the wheel of the big Packard is Coley.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
picking up tremendous speed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. - ROAD BED
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
proceeding over a series of turns, inclines, declivities (according to location terrain). Engines roar, brakes whinny, tires scream, skidding on the turns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE - ROAD BED
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Coley overtakes Macreedy. He steers the big car within a foot or two of the jeep. The terrain has steepened; on the right there is nothing between the road and the valley floor far below but a few inches of soft shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Macreedy pulls wide on a razor turn, Coley tries to come inside him. Macreedy, fighting for control of the veering jeep, succeeds in cutting him off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CURVE IN ROAD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the approach, Coley cuts sharp into the jeep. The jeep seems to roll with the blow, then leaps ahead, maneuvering the turn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT COLEY IN CAR (PROCESS)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coley is flustered, his face blood-shot with fury. He seems to generate an atmosphere of vicious, cruel craziness; the wild smile across his mouth is almost sensual, obscene. He floorboards the Packard. Like some monstrous battering ram, the heavy car smashes into the jeep's rear bumper, kicking the smaller vehicle jerkily ahead. Coley floorboards the gas pedal, again. Each time he slams into the jeep with sickening force, with the brutal abrasion of metal pounding metal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - MACREEDY - (PROCESS)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With one arm he works frantically to keep his under-sized car on the twisty road. He sees ahead a precipitous cliff falling off on an impossibly sharp curve. He makes a decision...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just ahead the gradient is comparatively gradual, however steep by normal standards. He swings the jeep off the road, onto the declivity. The car plunges downward, miraculously upright. Macreedy jockeys it to a whirring, shuddering halt in the soft sand at the bottom of a draw.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Macreedy turns slightly and looks up the mountain-side with the road at its summit...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHAT HE SEES: EXTREME LONG SHOT - COLEY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
standing at the edge of the road, peering down at him. In b.g., the Packard. Coley turns emphatically, gets into car, drives off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO MACREEDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His face is caked with the sweat of his exertions and dust kicked up by the grinding wheels. He exhales heavily and runs a shaky hand across the side of his head. He becomes aware suddenly of a NOISE, a trickling, an unmistakable tinkle as of running water. He frowns, opens the jeep door...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM SHOT - JEEP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Macreedy unlatches the hood and throws it open. The NOISE continues. Macreedy examines the engine and finds the difficulty...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT - ENGINE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
focal point: the nut joining the gas line with the carburetor has worked loose in the jouncing the car has taken. With his hand Macreedy screws it tight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM SHOT - JEEP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Macreedy lowers the hood, re-enters jeep. He turns on ignition. The engine fires. As he drives slowly out of the ravine...

his long face even more horsey than usual, with half an apple in his mouth. He stands in front of the grocery store, with the baskets of fruit on the sidewalk. He looks up, stops crunching.

GROUP SHOT - FAVORING SMITH AND COLEY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standing on the porch of the hotel, watching. Smith's face compresses, and his eyes swivel to rest on Coley's with cold, contemptuous anger. Coley licks his lips uneasily. Smith turns and enters the hotel. Coley meekly follows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FULL SHOT - MACREEDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He brakes the jeep before the garage. No one is there. He parks the vehicle, gets out and heads down the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. HOTEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Macreedy is about to go up the steps when he sees Coley's car at the curb. Both right fenders are creased. An ugly, jagged break has split the front bumper almost in half, one part angling crazily toward the sky, the other drooping in the dust of the road. Smith and Coley come out of the hotel. They stand on the porch, watching Macreedy as he in turn watches the car. They exchange a glance. Smith nods, so...

	Because of my brother. Pete. He'd never leave.

</LIZ>
<MACREEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't you ever think of going without him. You're sort of independent and he's... he's...

</LIZ>
<MACREEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing much. Only, there're not many places like this in America -- but even one is too many. Because I think something sort of bad happened here.

	<DIALOGUE>

He stands facing Smith on the porch, then...
</DIRECTION>
<MACREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
(with just a touch of wryness)

	<DIALOGUE>
	It's just, a girl like that has a future.

</SMITH>
<MACREEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What stopped you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The physical. They wouldn't take me. The morning after Pearl, I was the first man in line at Marine recruiting in Sand City. And they wouldn't take me.

<MACREEDY>

<SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What were you looking for in Adobe Flat?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SMITH>
<MACREEDY>

Smith laughs quietly.
</DIRECTION>
<MACREEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's so funny?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing. It's just -- I don't believe you. I believe a man is as big as what he seeks. I believe you're a big man, Mr. Macreedy.

</SMITH>
<MACREEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Flattery will get you nowhere.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why would a man like you be looking for a lousy Jap farmer?

</SMITH>
<MACREEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>

	Yes, you are.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat; looking hard at Macreedy)
</DIRECTION>

</SMITH>
<MACREEDY>

	What makes you mad, Mr. Smith?

(calmly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...the Japanese make you mad...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's different. After the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor... after Bataan...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SMITH>
<MACREEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and Komako made you mad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the same thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(scoffing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Loyal Japanese-Americans -- that's a laugh. They're mad dogs. Look at Corregidor, the death march.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SMITH>
<MACREEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did Komako have to do with Corregidor?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wasn't he a Jap? Look, Macreedy, there's a law in this county against shooting dogs. But if I see a mad dog loose, I don't wait for him to bite me.

<DIRECTION>
(exhales sharply,
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	All strangers do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not all. Some of 'em. When they come here snooping.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SMITH>
<MACREEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Snooping for what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, outsiders coming around, looking for something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SMITH>
<MACREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
(pressing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. People are always looking for something in this part of the West. To the historian, it's the "Old West." To the book writers, it's the "Wild West." To the businessmen, it's the "Undeveloped West." They all say we're backward and poor, and I guess we are.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We don't even have enough water.

	But this place, to us, is our West.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just wish they'd leave us alone.

</MACREEDY>
<SMITH>

(coldly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know what you mean.

</SMITH>
<MACREEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened to Komako?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He went away, I told you. Shortly after he left, a bunch of kids got fooling around out his place. They burned it down. It was one of those things -- you know how kids are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SMITH>
<DIRECTION>
Macreedy laughs quietly.
</DIRECTION>
<SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's funny?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SMITH>
<MACREEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing. Only -- I don't believe you. Any more than I believed you about the letters.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<SMITH>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't seem to believe anything I say.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SMITH>
<MACREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
(vaguely)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I do -- about businessmen, for instance. I think a businessman would be interested in Adobe Flat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SMITH>
<MACREEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All that land lying fallow. Could be put to some use. Like a graveyard.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Smith opens his mouth
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	to speak but Macreedy
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
goes on)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A historian might be interested, too. Because of the strange customs around here, such as burying cattle...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Burying cattle...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SMITH>
<MACREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
(calmly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something's buried out there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
He takes the wild flowers from his pocket, holding them in front of Smith.
</DIRECTION>
<MACREEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See these wild flowers? That means a grave. I've seen it overseas. I figure it isn't a man's grave or someone would have marked it. Sort of a mystery, isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sort of. Maybe you can figure it out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SMITH>
<DIRECTION>
Macreedy gets up, half turns to Smith.
</DIRECTION>
<MACREEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
He starts down the steps.
</DIRECTION>
<SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not give it a whirl?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Macreedy turns)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It'll help you pass the time...

He turns and walks down the street.

headed towards Doc's establishment. The building, which serves Doc as home, office and laboratory, has centered on a pane of glass:

<DIRECTION>
And in the lower right hand corner:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ASSAYER NOTARY PUBLIC

A few of the peeled gold and black letters are completely missing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The building is separated from the structure next to it by an alleyway. Filling the narrow passage is Hector David, his long massive body wedged against the wall like an unkempt monument. His little pig eyes meet Macreedy's. Hector spits in the dust with bland insolence.

walks up the steps and enters.

<DIRECTION>

Dark and shadowy. At the far end of a hallway an insipid light bulb burns. Macreedy goes toward it, entering...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. DOC'S LAB
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
devoted to the care and preservation of the Dear Departed. In the center of the room is a long rectangular slab stained with the juices of those unfortunates who have had occasion to rest thereon. The walls are lined with rickety bookcases jammed, not with volumes, but with the jugs and jars, the chemicals and unguents of Doc's multiple callings. In a corner three or four neat pine boxes are stacked one on the other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Doc sits at a cluttered desk feeding a large bowl of goldfish and sipping a glass of milk. He looks up as Macreedy enters.

He moves to photograph beside the map on the wall -- a large, impressive photograph of a placer mine in operation.

He moves to his desk, picks up a glistening blob of stone, resting next to an assayer's scales, and examines it...

He moves to the coffins piled in a corner and runs his hand down the smooth pine sides with loving tenderness.

Macreedy turns on the ignition switch. His foot kicks over the starter, but the spark doesn't catch. He tries again, then again. He pauses, frowns, as Doc comes down from the porch and joins him.

Again he presses the ignition switch. Nothing. And suddenly, in b.g., the great bulk of Hector David looms up, leaning against the porch pillar at the corner of the alleyway. His expression is almost dreamy. For a moment he stands there while Macreedy toys with the ignition and the sick engine wheezes and grinds. Then he ambles up to the hearse...

Macreedy takes the cigarette, lighting a match with one hand. He puts the fire to Doc's smoke and then lights his own. He inhales, exhales, thinking. Finally...
</DIRECTION>

Macreedy gets out of the car. Hector has already opened the hood. Doc peers nervously over his shoulder. As they study the engine, Hector's horsey face appears behind them. He gestures toward the engine.

Macreedy stands at the high counter, writing on a Postal Telegraph blank. Behind the counter, watching him nervously, is Hastings. At the agent's elbow is a big pitcher with dew on the glass. It holds a pale liquid and a chunk of ice. His eyes on Macreedy, Hastings refills a glass tumbler. He takes a gulp as Macreedy puts down the pencil and pushes the message toward him. Now Hastings puts down his glass, picks up the form and scans it hurriedly. He looks at Macreedy, eyes glazed with anxiety...

A few loafers are at the bar, draped bonelessly on high stools. There is the usual array of bottles and glasses aligned before a cracked, discolored mirror. In the corner is a jukebox. Along the opposite wall is a line of low stools facing a counter covered with oil-cloth thumb-tacked in place. Behind it is a greasy hot plate and a couple of soiled displays -- breakfast food, soft drinks, etc. At the grill counter is Sam, cleaning his finger-nails with a toothpick. At the bar, engaged in a worrisome conversation, are four loafers, FRANKLIN KROOL, WALT MURTRY, RON BENTHAM and STERLING LENARD.

He gets up, with his chili, and sits down three stools away. Coley straddles the stool Macreedy has vacated. He squirms on it, his movements exaggerated. Now he spins to face Smith.

Coley opens his mouth but, realizing he has been outmaneuvered, closes it again. The loafers in b.g. are silent, watching. Sam, seemingly oblivious to Coley's pressure on Macreedy, places a bottle of ketchup in front of the stranger. Coley gets up slowly and walks stiff-legged to Macreedy. He takes the bottle of ketchup and, without removing the cap, upends it over Macreedy's plate. The cap is drowned in a deluge of ketchup which overflows the plate and runs onto the counter.

Macreedy rises to go out. As he passes Coley, Coley takes his limp left arm and spins him slowly but firmly around. The two men face each other.
</DIRECTION>
<COLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I tied both hands...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Macreedy shakes free of Coley's grasp. Coley lunges. His big right fist streaks toward Macreedy's face. Macreedy ducks, weaving with the punch. He grabs Coley's belt, twisting Coley's body. The momentum of the swing throws Coley off balance. As he goes past Macreedy, the stranger tugs at his belt, twisting him to one side. He plants his left foot firmly on the toes of Coley's left boot, for a split second anchoring Coley in place. He chops the under side of his open hand in a short, vicious arc that lands solidly under Coley's ear. With the same motion, he brings the heel of his hand hard against and slightly under the tip of Coley's nose. The cartilage shatters. Blood spills down his face. Following through, Macreedy's elbow smashes beneath Coley's cheekbone. Macreedy's arm goes past the astonished, wind-burned face, finding Coley's right wrist. He jerks the wrist out and backward. It snaps. Coley whimpers, his face twisted in pain and perplexity. His body lolls forward. Macreedy steps back. He raises his right shoulder a few inches. His bent right arm drives up like a piston attached to the shoulder's lift. Fist and arm seem all one rigid piece with only the limber shoulder giving them motion. The fist strikes Coley's face, covering for a moment one side of his chin and a corner of his mouth between cheekbone and jawbone. Coley shuts his eyes and falls unconscious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smith, a puzzled expression on his face, watches Coley fall. He takes half a step toward him. Macreedy looks at Smith. Smith stops. Macreedy's face is wooden, with a trace of sullenness around the hard lines of his mouth. Working methodically, Macreedy frisks Coley. He takes from a pocket a long, ugly knife. He snaps the spring and the four-inch blade leaps into place. He looks at the knife in his hand and then at Smith. He smiles gently, even dreamily.

Macreedy walks slowly toward him, holding the knife. The are only three feet apart. Smith's hand goes to a pocket, closes inside over the outline of a pistol. Sam glances from Macreedy to Smith to the unconscious Coley. He sidles toward the door and runs out fast.

He walks past Smith and goes out the door. Self-consciously holding the knife, Smith turns to face the loafers at the bar. They say nothing; they stare at him, through him, like a panel of ghouls. The door opens, admitting Sam and Doc, who carries his little black medical bag. Doc looks at Coley.

Doc sits deep in the battered upholstery of one of the chairs. He stares fiercely across the room at Smith who is on the couch, reading a neatly folded newspaper. Behind him at the clerk's desk, Pete is fitfully involved in a game of solitaire. At the foot of the stairs Hector is pouring change into a slot machine. It whines, grinds, and clicks with rhythmic monotony, but it never seems to pay off. In the chair nearest Doc is Tim, with one of his boots off. He works hard and with some concentration, removing the other. Then he places them neatly at the foot of his chair. He wiggles his toes -- watching them with some interest.

</MACREEDY>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing.

</PETE>
<MACREEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Any message -- a telegram?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<PETE>
<DIRECTION>
(returning to his cards)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<DIRECTION>
As Macreedy turns from the desk, Doc joins him.
</DIRECTION>
<DOC>
<DIRECTION>
(to Macreedy, shrilly, gruffly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In case you're interested, Coley'll live.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(glaring at Smith and Hector)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm truly sorry to say.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOC>
<DIRECTION>
Smith coolly continues to read his paper. It is Hector who turns toward Doc...
</DIRECTION>
<HECTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(to Doc, jerking a
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	fat hand toward
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Macreedy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your friend's pretty tough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HECTOR>
<DOC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. He's wicked. He defends himself when he's attacked.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOC>
<DIRECTION>
Macreedy ignores the exchange of words. He walks across the frayed carpet to the nearest chair and drops into it. Doc, who has followed him, stands looking down at Macreedy for a long moment. Then...
</DIRECTION>
<DOC>
<DIRECTION>
(with some irritation)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well...? You going to just sit here and let time run out?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOC>
<MACREEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm waiting for a wire. From the state cops.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<DOC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sent it through Hastings?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(an audible sigh)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just don't expect an answer, if that's the way you sent it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOC>
<MACREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
(looking toward the door)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he rises)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Doc follows his gaze as Hastings enters the lobby and looks around. He sees Macreedy coming toward him. He walks rigidly in an arc past Macreedy to Smith. He holds out a Postal Telegraph form. Smith puts down his paper and takes it. Macreedy, followed by Doc, goes over to Smith. Tim in his stockinged feet joins them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smith scans the message. He looks up to meet Macreedy's gaze. Smith rises. Hector swaggers over from the slot machine. Hastings slips around the back of the couch, protected by the barricade of Hector's great body.
</DIRECTION>
<MACREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
(evenly, to Smith)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think that's for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he takes the message
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	from Smith's hand and quickly glances at it. Looking up at
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Hastings)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's the answer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
Hastings is silent. A brittle expression of bemusement crosses Smith's features.
</DIRECTION>
<SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You expect an answer -- to a wire that's never sent?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SMITH>
<DIRECTION>
Macreedy's mouth compresses in a harsh grin.
</DIRECTION>
<SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's so funny?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SMITH>
<MACREEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing. Just a thought --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(his eyes turn to
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hastings. Hastings
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
wilts)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- a thought dazzling in its purity...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
Macreedy takes a step toward Hastings. The telegraph agent bounces away.
</DIRECTION>
<MACREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
(slowly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're in a jam, Hastings. You gave my telegram to Smith.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<DOC>
<DIRECTION>
(excitedly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You warty wretch! That's a federal offense!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOC>
<MACREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
(to Smith)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're in deep, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(grins hard)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like I said, it's getting tougher and tougher.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Tim)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sheriff, you'd better do something about this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
Tim hesitates, blinking his eyes worriedly, shifting from one stockinged foot to the other. Smith watches him insolently as he takes the message from Macreedy and gestures with it vaguely...
</DIRECTION>
<TIM>
<DIRECTION>
(to Smith)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I reckon that's right, Mr. Smith...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIM>
<HECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be a jerk, Tim.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HECTOR>
<TIM>
<DIRECTION>
(to Smith, seriously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Divulging information -- there's a law...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIM>
<SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tim, you're pathetic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SMITH>
<TIM>
<DIRECTION>
(doggedly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could be. But I'm still Sheriff.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIM>
<SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the point. You're not Sheriff any more. You just lost a job, you're so pathetic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SMITH>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches out, clawing the badge from Tim's chest. He jabs it on Hector's vest.
</DIRECTION>
<SMITH>
<DIRECTION>
(to Hector)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, Sheriff. Take over.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SMITH>
<DOC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't do that!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOC>
<SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't I? I put him in office. Now I take him out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SMITH>
<DIRECTION>
Hector moves his elephantine bulk within inches of Macreedy...
</DIRECTION>
<HECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now. You want to register a complaint?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HECTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Macreedy doesn't answer. Hector takes the message from Tim's limp hand and tears it into little pieces.
</DIRECTION>
<HECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To register a complaint, boy, you've got to have evidence. You got evidence?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HECTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Macreedy doesn't answer.
</DIRECTION>
<HECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got a big mouth, boy, makin' accusations, disturbin' the peace. There's laws in this county protectin' innocent folks from big mouths. Why, I'd just hate to...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HECTOR>
<SMITH>
<DIRECTION>
(interrupting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hector...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(wearily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Hector.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SMITH>
<DIRECTION>
He walks out, the new Sheriff strutting beside him, with Hastings in their wake. For a moment Macreedy, Doc and Tim stand in the center of the lobby. Pete eyes them non- committally and goes back to his solitaire. He glances up now and then, moving the cards with a purposeful sort of slowness, as of a more natural swiftness restrained by his preoccupation with the three men in the lobby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Macreedy is deep in thought. Abstractedly he tugs at his collar and then repeats the ritual of lighting a cigarette. Tim's shoulders are slumped. Humiliation has corroded him, flesh and soul. Even Doc is momentarily subdued; he too, feels degraded, unclean. Macreedy looks from one to the other of the good, ineffectual companions that circumstance has so haphazardly tossed his way. He takes a few steps to his suitcase, Doc and Tim trailing him; Doc, for want of something better to do; Tim, out of his deep, inexpressible need for support. Macreedy takes an untapped bottle of whiskey from his bag. He thumbs the cork loose and holds the bottle out to Tim. Tim takes a drink.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The light on the clerk's desk goes on, and we are aware that day has gone and that night is falling. The pressing, fierce light has drained from the lobby, leaving a shadowy, silvery dreariness. The shadows have lengthened and the silver has tarnished with the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DOC>
<DIRECTION>
(hopefully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all right, Tim. We're not licked yet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOC>
<TIM>
<DIRECTION>
(numbly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ain't we? I am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIM>
<DOC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There comes a time, Tim, when a man's just got to do something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOC>
<TIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not me. I'm useless, and I know it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIM>
<DOC>
<DIRECTION>
(imploring)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No man is useless, if he's got a friend...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOC>
<DIRECTION>
Pete comes out from behind the desk, walking from one lamp in the lobby to another, turning them on.
</DIRECTION>
<DOC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm your friend, Tim.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOC>
<TIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then let me alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIM>
<DIRECTION>
He hands Doc the whiskey bottle.
</DIRECTION>
<DOC>
<DIRECTION>
(jabbing at Macreedy with a thumb)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's going to need you before the night is over.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOC>
<DIRECTION>
He downs a snort, then looks at Pete, who approaches them.
</DIRECTION>
<DOC>
<DIRECTION>
(contemptuously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And all the useful men are on the other side.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOC>
<DIRECTION>
As Pete turns on the lamp behind Doc, he reacts ever so slightly to Doc's words. His almost imperceptible grimace is not lost on Macreedy. Macreedy watches the young man as he continues to light the lamps...
</DIRECTION>
<TIM>
<DIRECTION>
(angrily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lemme alone, I tell ya!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIM>
<DIRECTION>
Doc slams the whiskey bottle down on a nearby table.
</DIRECTION>
<DOC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't let you alone! I can't let myself alone! Don't you understand that?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he turns from Tim to
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pete, who is unable to shake his gaze.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Then, sadly, fiercely)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Four years ago something terrible happened here. We did nothing about it. Nothing. The whole town fell into a sort of settled melancholy, and the people in it closed their eyes and held their tongues and failed the test with a whimper.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOC>
<DIRECTION>
Self-consciously Pete has backed off until now he leans against the outside of the clerk's desk. But he still can't shut his ears to what Doc is saying...
</DIRECTION>
<DOC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now something terrible is going to happen again, and in a way we're lucky because we've been given a second chance. And this time I won't close my eyes, I won't hold my tongue, and if I'm needed I won't fail.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(almost harshly, again facing Tim)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And neither will you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOC>
<DIRECTION>
Tim sighs, running a thick hand over his forehead...
</DIRECTION>
<TIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got such a headache, I'm bewildered. I hurt all over.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIM>
<MACREEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(unconsciously his
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	right arm strays to massage the paralyzed
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
left)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- pain is bewildering. I came here bewildered, full of self-pity, afraid to fight back.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(gesturing with his hand to Pete)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And then your friend Smith tried to kill me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(the muscles around Pete's mouth tighten)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Funny, how a man clings to the earth when he feels there's a chance he may never see it again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<DOC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's a difference between clinging to the earth...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(eyeing Tim almost contemptuously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and crawling on it. You going to stand by and watch forever?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOC>
<TIM>
<DIRECTION>
(flatly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I ain't gonna watch, and I ain't gonna get into it, either.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIM>
<DIRECTION>
There is a moment of crashing silence. Then...
</DIRECTION>
<TIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm gettin' out. I'm sorry, Mr. Macreedy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIM>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly he lumbers out of the lobby. Doc watches him go. Again the benumbing silence, cut finally, unexpectedly by...
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Doc)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'd be smart to get out, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<DOC>
<DIRECTION>
(angrily turning to Pete)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's too many smart guys around here. I'm glad I'm a dummy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOC>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a troublesome dummy. You're liable to end up on your own slab...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<DOC>
<DIRECTION>
(heatedly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I expect to be in a lot more trouble before I die...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOC>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go home, Doc.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he jerks his head
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	toward Macreedy, and
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
with mock bravado...)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's all washed up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<MACREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
(grinning harshly at him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think so?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
His right hand closes over the neck of the whiskey bottle on the end table. Abstractedly fingering it, he walks with tense, deliberate steps toward Pete at the desk.
</DIRECTION>
<MACREEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was washed up when I got off that train...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
He continues to advance inexorably toward Pete.
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>
<DIRECTION>
(flatly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You shouldn' of got off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<MACREEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Had to. I had one last duty to perform before I resigned from the human race.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<DOC>
<DIRECTION>
(quizzically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you were going to Los Angeles, that hot-bed of pomp and vanity. Is that resigning from the human race?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOC>
<MACREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
(shrugging)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	L.A.'s a good jumping off place -- for the Islands, for Mexico, Central America.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<DOC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOC>
<MACREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
(again shrugs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. I was looking for a place to get lost, I guess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<DOC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOC>
<MACREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
(slapping his paralyzed
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	arm with the whisky
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
bottle)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because of this. I thought I'd never be able to function again.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turning to Pete)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks to your friend Smith, I found I was wrong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
He is now within a couple of yards of Pete.
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>
<DIRECTION>
(drily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. You're a man of action.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<MACREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
(slowly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know your problem.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(with mounting vigor)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'd like me to die quickly, without wasting too much of your time...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Pete opens his mouth
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	to say something, but Macreedy presses
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
on)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...or silently, without making you feel too uncomfortable... or thankfully, without making your memories of the occasion too unpleasant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment Pete stares at Macreedy, terribly disturbed by the incisiveness of Macreedy's analysis. Then...
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>
<DIRECTION>
(bitterly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My memories are so pleasant as it is...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<DIRECTION>
In sudden frustration, Pete grabs the deck of cards on the clerk's desk and slams them down hard. They scatter. He turns, stares blankly [...] between Doc and Macreedy.
</DIRECTION>
<MACREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly pressing his advantage)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened, Pete?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
Pete doesn't answer.
</DIRECTION>
<DOC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you going to tell him -- or you want me to?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Smith owns Adobe Flat. He leased it to Komako -- thought he had cheated him, thought Komako could never even run stock without water. There was never any water on Adobe Flat. Komako dug a well, by hand. He must have went down one hundred and fifty feet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOC>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He got water, plenty. Smith was pretty sore. He didn't like Japs anyway.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<DOC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's an understatement.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOC>
<PETE>

	The day after Pearl Harbor, Smith went to Sand City.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<MACREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
(interrupting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. To enlist. He was turned down.

</MACREEDY>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was sore when he got back. About ten o'clock he started drinking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<MACREEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ten o'clock in the morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Hector joined him, and Coley. Then Sam, and about nine p.m. -- me. We were all drunk -- patriotic drunk. We went out to Komako's for a little fun, I guess -- scare him a little.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<MACREEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you know him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'd seen him around some, but none of us knew him. When he heard us coming, he locked the door. Smith started a fire. The Jap came running out. His clothes were burning. Smith shot him. I didn't even know Smith had a gun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<MACREEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then you all got scared, buried him, kept quiet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
Pete nods helplessly, bowing his head. Macreedy sighs, looks down at the bottle in his hand, slowly puts it on the table...
</DIRECTION>
<MACREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
(softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did Komako have any family besides his son Joe?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<DOC>
<DIRECTION>
(puzzled)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His son...? Nobody around here knew he had a son.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOC>
<MACREEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He had one. But he's dead, too. He's buried in Italy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<DOC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing here, Mr. Macreedy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOC>
<MACREEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Joe Komako died in Italy, saving my life. They gave him a medal. I came here to give it to his father.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. Doc, realizing the enormity of Macreedy's admission, frowns, rubs a hand across his tired eyes. Pete looks at Macreedy for a long, shocked moment. He shivers.
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>
<DIRECTION>
(awfully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God forgive me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<DIRECTION>
He takes the bottle from the table and shakily pours a shot glass of liquor. As he raises it to his mouth...
</DIRECTION>
<MACREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
(to Pete, harshly guttural)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It'll take a lot of whiskey to wash out your guts...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
Pete is motionless, holding the glass inches from his lips, hypnotized by Macreedy's voice, as hard and as cold as his eyes...
</DIRECTION>
<MACREEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...And it will never help -- not even a barrel full washes away murder!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
Macreedy's hand shoots out, in a short, inexorable arc, smashing his palm across the shot glass. The whiskey bursts in a spray, the glass flies halfway across the room, shattering as it lands against something solid. Pete is stunned, Doc perplexed, at Macreedy's violence. They stare at him...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Macreedy's eyes are murky. The creases between the brows over his nose are deep. His nostrils move in and out with his breathing. Pete and Doc regard him with growing uneasiness. Rage comes into Macreedy's face, turning it a painful red.
</DIRECTION>
<MACREEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But maybe I'm wrong. Go on -- drink.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(scornfully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What else is left for you?!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(mounting anger)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're as dead as Komako, only you don't know it!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(roaring)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You also don't know that it's not enough to feel guilty. It's not enough to confess. It's not enough to say, "Forgive me, I've done wrong."
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<DOC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take it easy, Macreedy. Sit down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOC>
<MACREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
(turning on him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sit down?! Or would you rather have me kneel, to beg his pardon for raising a touchy subject?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
Pete squirms under Macreedy's relentless attack.
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>
<DIRECTION>
(shaking his head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't have to remind me. I've never forgotten...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<MACREEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, that's mighty noble of you. You feel ashamed -- that's noble, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(in mounting crescendo)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And four years from now you'll probably be sitting here telling somebody else you haven't forgotten me. That's progress -- you'll still be ashamed but I'll be dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
Macreedy grabs the bottle, shoving it across the table toward Pete.
</DIRECTION>
<MACREEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go on, have your drink.

Pete pushes the bottle aside, too ravaged by Macreedy's words and his own thoughts to drink. He shakes his head grimly and then, with sudden decision, goes to the switchboard and plugs in a line.

ANOTHER ANGLE - MACREEDY AND DOC

Slowly he replaces the phone on the switch-board. He comes around from behind the desk, joining Macreedy and Doc.

DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. HOTEL LOBBY - PETE, HECTOR AND DOC - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pete and Doc are nervously alert, drained of energy, waiting. Hector is downright bored. He toys with his pistol, squinting at it, twirling the barrel. Finding neither interest nor pleasure in the piece, he jams it back in his holster and strolls with exaggerated surety out on the porch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. PORCH - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The congregation of loafers look up as Hector emerges. Imbued with his own bullying importance, he draws the pistol, maneuvers an extravagant pinwheel and a few other gaudy tricks. Then he sighs as boredom again takes over. He walks down the steps to catch a bit of air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. LOBBY - DOC AND PETE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The disappearance of Hector (o.s.) down the street galvanizes them into action. They hurry out of the lobby toward the back of the hotel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. ALLEY - BEHIND HOTEL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vague in the pallid light escaping through a few back windows. The hotel's rear door is tightly shut. Around the far corner of the street (extreme b.g.) comes the gangling body of Hector David. He walks toward CAMERA. Perhaps twenty-five yards away he stops to rest against a fence like a leaning tower.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - HECTOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His hand goes to a pocket and comes out with a crumpled half pack of cigarettes. Suddenly the movement is arrested; something at the other end of the street captures his bleak attention.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHAT HE SEES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A jeep, headlights off, slowly turns the corner, pulls up to the curb and parks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE - HECTOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
pockets his cigarettes and starts slowly for the jeep, a quizzical frown on his horsy face. He approaches the back door of the hotel, oblivious to it as he continues toward the jeep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. REAR HALLWAY OF HOTEL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the far end b.g., toward the lobby, a single unshaded light bulb burns dully. A slight figure stands in f.g. To one side is a narrow U-shaped alcove blanketed in heavy shadows. The features of the man in the hall and the slim lines of his body blend vaguely in the darkness. With enormous care, he turns a knob and opens the door leading to the alley behind the hotel. Light thrown by the back windows reveals that the figure is Pete. The same pallid light from the alley, glancing across the alcove, momentarily illuminates it. Glued as close to the recessed wall as is humanly possible is Doc. He is partially shielded by one of those hotel hose wheels around which an old fire hose is wound. The heavy brass nozzle of the hose hangs from the end.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Doc grips a twelve-inch length of lead pipe. Pete swallows nervously and peers outside, first to the right, then to the left. His eyes glaze with fear, and his jaw tightens with tension.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. ALLEY - ANOTHER ANGLE - FAVORING PETE

</DIRECTION>
<PETE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hector!

<DIRECTION>
Hector stops, turns to face Pete. He hesitates, then...
</DIRECTION>
<HECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hmmmm?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HECTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Then, with a final glance at the jeep, Hector lumbers to Pete, who disappears inside the hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. REAR HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Hector enters and stops. Pete quickly closes the door behind him and walks toward the lobby, attempting to draw Hector toward the black alcove center screen b.g. But Hector is not to be sucked in. He glares at Pete, waiting. (NOTE: The following dialogue is delivered sotto voce.)
</DIRECTION>
<HECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What you want?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HECTOR>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's still in his room. Macreedy, I mean.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<HECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So...? You want me to tuck him in?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HECTOR>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought maybe you wanted to tell Smith.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<HECTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(explaining something
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	he feels Pete already

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Smith said he'd be here at midnight. He don't want to be disturbed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HECTOR>
<DIRECTION>
He jams a cigarette in his mouth. Pete watches him frantically as he searches his pockets for a match. He can't find one.
</DIRECTION>
<HECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got a match?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HECTOR>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on. I got some in the lobby.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to turn. Hector's pig eyes are slits of suspicion. Before Pete can move, Hector reaches out, hooking two heavy fingers inside a pocket of Pete's shirt. Slowly Hector's expression changes to one of insidious cunning. His fingers come out of Pete's pocket, and between them is a paper book of matches.
</DIRECTION>
<HECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you didn't have a match.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HECTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Pete is unable to answer. He is scared to death.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. ALCOVE - DOC
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
sweating with frustration. Hector is six feet away, and armed -- too far away for Doc to risk an attack with his lead pipe. Doc looks around vaguely, wildly, for another weapon. A fraction of an inch from his nose is the hose wheel. For a split second he hesitates. Then slowly, with infinite care, he tightens the heavy brass nozzle and begins to unwind the hose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. REAR HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now Hector is alert. He studies Pete's twitching face. Elaborately he tears a match from the pack and scratches it. It takes fire, cupped in the rampart of his big hands. It lights up the hall, and as Hector looks around he sees something through a mirror -- over his shoulder and six feet away Doc materializes out of the shadows of the alcove. As Hector whirls, going for his gun, Doc swings the hose with sudden deadly aim. It uncoils like a snake, and the brass nozzle crashes with a mighty thud across Hector's skull. Hector groans. He sinks unconscious to the floor. Doc stands there, paralyzed by his action. Pete tears toward the lobby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. LOBBY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Pete rushes in. He moves directly to the desk, leans over and presses the buzzer behind the desk three times. He turns and runs back toward the rear of the building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. REAR STAIRS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Macreedy barrels down. He pauses briefly in the hall as he sees Doc still standing with the hose and the nozzle dangling like a pendulum from his hand. Their eyes lock briefly in understanding...
</DIRECTION>
<MACREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
(with a half smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll never forgive you, Doc...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he gestures toward Hector, out cold)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...for depriving me of that pleasure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
He heads toward the alley.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. ALLEY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Macreedy rushes out. He pauses, looking quickly right, then left. He sees a jeep parked at the curb far down the street. He runs toward it. The jeep, its headlights off, starts for him. He swings onto the moving vehicle, falling heavily into the seat beside Liz Brooks. He slumps there, breathing heavily as the jeep, with a grinding of gears, cuts through the night, picking up speed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. REAR HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Pete joins Doc. Silently, motionlessly, the two men stare for a long moment at Hector -- particularly at the pistol lying beside him. Then they look at each other, and the same thought seems to flash in their minds...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
QUICK DISSOLVE:

MED. SHOT - JEEP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
with Liz and Macreedy as she cuts sharply into a crossroad. She drives skillfully over the knotty road which is little more than a trail. Her lovely features are distorted with her discontent and the ache for attention. After a moment she gives voice to her fantasy...

ANOTHER ANGLE - JEEP

<DIRECTION>
with Macreedy and Liz as it winds to the far end of the boulders on a trail that drops off into a flat basin. Solid forms loom up in the darkness; they are unrecognizable, yet Macreedy senses some tense familiarity with the terrain... He frowns. Suddenly Liz brakes the jeep -- so sharply Macreedy lurches forward in the seat.
</DIRECTION>
<MACREEDY>

She moves away from Macreedy to get out of the jeep. He reaches across quickly, gripping her arm. She turns to face him, disturbed by his hardness of jaw and eye...

<LIZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leggo! Leggo of me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZ>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly they are hit by a blinding pair of headlights like [...] The beams cut jaggedly through the night, throwing into sharp immediate relief the lava rocks, the broken windmill, the gutted house, the litter-strewn, unmarked grave at Adobe Flat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Liz throws away the ignition key. Macreedy bails out of the jeep, still holding the girl.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE TWO SHOT - LIZ AND MACREEDY

He looks up blindly into the headlights glaring from the granitic high ground some 60 yards away. His grip on the girl's shoulder is like a steel trap. He pushes her down beside Komako's grave, hugging the side of the jeep as a SHOT rips the gravel at their feet. Pulling the girl with him, he takes cover in the slight concavity of the grave. The jeep is between them and the headlights -- between them and the source of the gunfire. Liz struggles to break away. Suddenly bullets kick up a storm around him. A bullet smashes into the flowers, exploding tiny cruel fragments of dirt into Macreedy's face. He gasps in pain, releasing Liz. He rubs his eyes as if to convince himself that he is not blind. Liz breaks from the grave. Now, five yards from Macreedy...

She starts toward the headlights.

She reaches the foot of the rocky ridge, with the two enormous eyes on top. She begins to climb, up... up...

	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a few more steps, honey.

She is almost at the top; a vertically sheer rock about five feet high separates her from it. She looks up at Smith, towering over her at the edge of the precipice. He holds his rifle almost languorously.

He brings the rifle down, aiming almost casually at Liz. Her eyes go wide. She steps back, spins around, running crazily down the steep incline.

<LIZ>

(yelling wildly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Macreedy! Macreedy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZ>
<DIRECTION>
A SHOT rings out. She falls forward, rolling slowly down the embankment. She lies there. Blood trickles from the corner of her pretty mouth. A rattling noise rises from deep in her throat, and then subsides.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the silence the outline of Reno Smith emerges. Holding his rifle at the ready, his silhouette illuminated sharply in the twin beams of light, he climbs down the side of the cliff. He looks toward the jeep and Macreedy, not once at the girl at his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<LIZ>

(sadly, almost reproachfully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You shouldn't have done that...

Smith pays no attention to her. He advances inexorably with rifle held at his hip. He fires at Macreedy.

Macreedy wipes the last of the fragments from his eyes. His face is still streaked with dirt and shale. He turns, searching for something, anything, to fight back with. Then he remembers... Stiffening, his body set, his eyes narrow, he moves purposefully toward the front of the jeep and crawls under it. Again Smith opens up on him. Bullet after bullet pours into the confined space, nicking the wall, ricocheting off the jeep with a frightening, fluttery, wheezing sound. The firing stops again and in the silence we HEAR a familiar TRICKLE, as in running water...

<DIRECTION>
He has unscrewed the nut and unconnected the gas line with the carburator. A spurt of gasoline is running out. With a quick motion he picks up an empty whisky bottle from the litter-strewn earth. He fills it with gasoline, quickly screws the nut back on. Now he sweeps his necktie free of his collar. Holding it with his teeth, he tears the felt lining free from its silk face. He twists half the lining inside the bottle, knotting the other end securely around the bottle's neck, leaving a long strand dangling.

lights a match, placing the flame to the dangling end of the tie. It catches. He flings himself to his feet and with the same motion whips the fiery bottle like a football, hard and straight toward Smith. Smith fires once, fast and wild. The bottle crashes against the rocks at his feet and bursts with a shattering explosion. Smith screams as the razor-sharp slivers rip his flesh. In a puff of flame, his clothes ignite. He drops the rifle and goes down, squirming frantically on the black ashy ground.

favoring Macreedy as he tears out of the hole. He hurls himself at Smith. Wooden-faced, almost dreamy-eyed, he shovels the ashy dirt over Smith's prone chest, putting out the fire. Smith struggles halfway to his feet. Macreedy grabs his shoulder, helping him up. Smith looks at Macreedy through eyes bleary with fear and pain and shock.

He drives his right fist against Smith's chin. Smith's head snaps back as far as it can go and then wobbles to rest on his chest. He collapses. Macreedy blows out his breath hard. He staggers to Liz. As he bends over her...

Liz's jeep, driven by Macreedy, rolls slowly down the empty main street of the sleeping town. Behind him, under a tarp, the body of the girl lies lifeless across the seat. On the seat beside him is Smith's rifle, the balance a few inches from Macreedy's elbow. On the right front fender of the jeep Smith sits precariously, his shirt scorched and ragged. He wears a sullen expression of pained indifference.

as Macreedy pulls up to the curb in front of the jail and cuts the ignition. He grabs the rifle, and steps around to Smith.

Smith complies.

<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. JAIL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Macreedy marches Smith up the steps. The jail door opens. A man emerges, wearing a Mackinaw over his vest and carrying a rifle. It is Tim. For a moment Macreedy eyes him in silence. His gun finger tightens on the rifle in his hand. Tim's rifle, too, is at the ready...

<MACREEDY>

(after a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Am I going to have trouble with you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<TIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nope. But I sure thought the situation was going to be like reversed. I thought I was going to have trouble...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(nodding sharply in Smith's direction)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...with him. I'll take care of him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIM>
<MACREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
(still hesitating)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just as you took care of his buddies?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<TIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just as I took care of his buddies. Me, an' Doc, and Pete...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIM>
<DIRECTION>
The SOUND of running feet padding along the dirt road increases on SOUND TRACK. Macreedy turns slightly, to see Doc huffing toward him. The older man climbs the jail steps and comes to an abrupt halt, his eyes going from one to the other of the two men in the stand-off.
</DIRECTION>
<DOC>
<DIRECTION>
(to Macreedy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all right, Macreedy...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOC>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls Tim's Mackinaw to one side, revealing the silver- plated star pinned at the breast.
</DIRECTION>
<DOC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Old Tim here's got his badge back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOC>
<DIRECTION>
Macreedy swings his rifle from Tim to Smith. Tim lowers his, stepping to one side, allowing Smith, covered by Macreedy, to enter the jail. He goes in, Doc following. Pete sits silently at Tim's desk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. JAIL

<DIRECTION>
In one of the two cells are Coley and Hector. In the other, Sam and Hastings.
</DIRECTION>
<MACREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
(looking around)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well. The gang is all here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<TIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought I'd take one last whack at my job. Even if Smith killed me for it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIM>
<MACREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
(jerking his head toward Smith)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put him in with Hastings.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
Tim turns his key in the cell door. Macreedy tiredly goes to Pete at the desk.
</DIRECTION>
<MACREEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your sister's outside, Pete.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
Pete rises. Macreedy halts him momentarily, gripping his arm...
</DIRECTION>
<MACREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
(flatly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
Pete walks dazedly out the door. Tim grabs Smith's shoulder and propels him roughly through the cell door. He slams it hard. As the clatter of the iron door reverberates harshly...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. HOTEL - BLACK ROCK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The townspeople, with Doc f.g., are gathered silently in the street, staring sadly, dumbly at the hotel before them. Doc wears a dark business suit, neat and conservative. The door opens (o.s.) and the people look up, their eyes lighting with expectancy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHAT THEY SEE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Macreedy comes out of the door, carrying his suitcase. For a moment he pauses, looking at the uplifted faces of the people in the street. In the distance we HEAR the horn of a stream- liner. Macreedy goes down the steps, skirts the watching crowd and heads for the railroad station. Almost immediately Doc falls in step with him. The townspeople, still silent, trail after them
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVING SHOT - MACREEDY AND DOC

in f.g., the townspeople behind them. In b.g., as we pass, we see the main street just as we saw it when Macreedy entered town a few short hours ago.
</DIRECTION>
<MACREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
(walking, after a beat, to Doc)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tim knows where to find me if I'm needed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
Doc nods. He blinks and frowns...
</DIRECTION>
<MACREEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's on your mind, Doc?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<DOC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing. Only... about that medal. Can we have it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOC>
<MACREEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"We...?" Can who have it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<DOC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We.

(indicating the

	Us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOC>
<MACREEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<DOC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, we need it, I guess. It's something we can maybe build on. This town is wrecked, just as bad as if it was bombed out. Maybe it can come back...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOC>
<MACREEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some towns come back. Some don't. It depends on the people.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREEDY>
<DIRECTION>
A NOISE o.s. attracts Macreedy's attention. He turns, as do Doc and the townsmen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHAT THEY SEE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In front of the jail, each of them handcuffed, are Smith, Coley, Hector, Sam and Hastings. Tim and four cops escort them to two State Police cars which are parked beside Tim's old sedan and another car (presumably belonging to a member of the press). The newspaperman (WITHOUT A PRESS CARD IN HIS HAT) stands to one side with Pete. Pete as well as Tim have changed clothes; they look clean and trim. Coley has his arm in a sling. Hector's hat hides the bandage on his head.

<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Macreedy resumes walking toward the abandoned station, with Doc at his side and the people behind him. The train pulls in.
</DIRECTION>
<DOC>
<DIRECTION>
(still pressing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That medal would help.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOC>
<DIRECTION>
Macreedy is silent. He walks on, to the platform. He pauses, looking at the people silently in his wake and then at Doc. He takes a black velvet-covered box from his pocket -- the box containing the medal -- looks at it, and slowly hands it to Doc.
</DIRECTION>
<DOC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, Macreedy. Thanks for everything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOC>

Macreedy turns and exits from SHOT. The people look after him.

Macreedy and a conductor stand at the doorway. The town is seen behind them and the people standing there. In the distance, Tim's car recedes.
