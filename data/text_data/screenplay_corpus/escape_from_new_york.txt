</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BUS -- NIGHT S.D. "SNAKE" PLISSKEN gets off the bus, looks around, and is escorted by three guards into the base. He looks like the essence of cool. His hair is long, wavy, and ratty, he lost his left eye somewhere along the line, and he's got a two-day beard thing going on. He's wearing a black spandex/kevlar type shirt with zippers across the shoulders, and a pair of camouflage pants with lots of pockets. His jacket is a brown leather jacket that has seen far better days, and he's wearing a pair of handcuffs that have, instead of the links we're used to, a straight metal bar between them. He's not resisting anything, but the police are not taking any chances.

She pulls out a slip of PAPER and proceeds to read.

	We, the soldiers of the national liberation front of America, in the name of the workers and all the oppressed of this imperialist country have struck a fatal blow to the racist police stick!
	</DIALOGUE>
</REBEL>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PLANE -- NIGHT A secret service AGENT taps on the door with his rifle as the rebel continues.
</DIRECTION>
<REBEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What better revolutionary example than to let the president perish in the inhuman dungeon of his own imperialist prison?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REBEL>

The agent runs back down the plane to the President and his advisers.
</DIRECTION>
<AGENT>

<DIRECTION>
INT. BASE -- NIGHT Rehme watches monitors as Hauk talks.
</DIRECTION>
<HAUK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	1-W-Larry. Over the battery. We're moving down. Direct sight ahead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAUK>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NEW YORK -- NIGHT The helicopters land. A swarm of policemen run out, and Hauk hangs back. He follows with a second swarm. The first swarm assumes a defensive position near the pod. Hauk examines the pod. It's definitely empty, and the rest of the jet is surrounded in flames.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An odd LAUGH from nowhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WEIRDO walks out of the darkness. He nods his head to Hauk.
</DIRECTION>
<WEIRDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You touch me... he dies. If you're not in the air in thirty seconds... he dies. You come back in... he dies.
	</DIALOGUE>

Weirdo takes a package out of his shirt and unwraps it to reveal the President's middle finger, complete with ring.
</DIRECTION>
<WEIRDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twenty seconds.

</WEIRDO>

	</DIALOGUE>
</WEIRDO>
<HAUK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go. Let's go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAUK>
<DIRECTION>
Weirdo grins in triumph as the police force swarms back to the helicopters and hauls ass out of New York.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BASE -- NIGHT Rehme stands behind a desk, talking on the phone. Hauk is in the foreground, looking pensive.
</DIRECTION>
<REHME>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, he's right here, Mr. Vice President.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REHME>
<DIRECTION>
Hauk picks up a phone.
</DIRECTION>
<HAUK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is Bob Hauk. ...We can't. If we move in with choppers, they'll kill him. We're lucky if he's not dead already... They don't want anything yet. By the time they figure out what they want, it'll be too late.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAUK>
<REHME>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell him we have to go with your plan now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REHME>
<DIRECTION>
Hauk waves him off.
</DIRECTION>
<HAUK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can't wait until tomorrow. If we have to move in and take the island, it's a last resort. It's 8:45. I want permission to try a rescue. Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAUK>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HAUK'S OFFICE -- NIGHT Hauk calmly arms a .45 pistol. He looks up from his desk.
</DIRECTION>
<HAUK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAUK>
<OVERPROTECTIVE_SECURITY_GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's dangerous, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OVERPROTECTIVE_SECURITY_GUARD>
<HAUK>
<DIRECTION>
(with quiet confidence)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. I'll be OK.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAUK>
<HAUK_S_P_O_V>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We see the silhouette of an unmistakable figure. It's Snake Plissken all right, live and in the flesh. The guards leave. Snake walks into Hauk's office and sits down in the chair across from Hauk. He raises his cuffed hands to Hauk as if to say "Take these off me, asshole," but he doesn't actually say anything. Hauk shakes his head.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAUK_S_P_O_V>
<HAUK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not a fool, Plissken.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAUK>
<SNAKE>
<DIRECTION>
(coooooool)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Call me Snake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SNAKE>
<DIRECTION>
Hauk puts on his glasses and proceeds to read a file.
</DIRECTION>
<HAUK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	S.D. Plissken. American Lieutenant. Special Forces Unit, Black Flight. Two Purple Hearts, Leningrad and Siberia. Youngest man to be decorated by the President. You robbed the federal reserve depository. Life sentence, New York Maximum Security Penitentiary. I'm ready to kick your ass out of the world, War Hero.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAUK>
<DIRECTION>
Snake could not care less. He reaches forward with his still-cuffed right hand, picks up a cigarette, picks up a match with his left hand, strikes the match and takes a drag from his cigarette. He lets out a calm breath and says:
</DIRECTION>
<SNAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SNAKE>
<HAUK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hauk. Police Commissioner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAUK>
<SNAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bob Hauk...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SNAKE>
<HAUK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Special Forces Unit. Texas Thunder. We heard of you, too, Plissken.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAUK>
<SNAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are we talking?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SNAKE>
<HAUK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have a deal for you. You'll receive full pardon for every criminal act committed in the United States.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAUK>
<DIRECTION>
Hauk shows Snake the pardon. Snake's eye lights up. This is something he wants. He's interested now, and can't hide it.
</DIRECTION>
<HAUK>
<DIRECTION>
(pressing his advantage)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There was an accident about an hour ago. A small jet went down inside New York City. The President was on board.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAUK>
<SNAKE>
<DIRECTION>
(re-establishing control over the conversation)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	President of what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SNAKE>
<HAUK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not funny, Plissken.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You go in, find the President and bring him out in 24 hours, and you're a free man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAUK>
<DIRECTION>
We sense amusement from Snake. This is not the first time the government has asked him for a favor. But he's not a soldier or a "War Hero" anymore. He knows they need him more than he needs their pardon. He's holding the cards now, and he knows it.
</DIRECTION>
<SNAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twenty-four hours, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SNAKE>
<HAUK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm making you an offer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAUK>
<SNAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bullshit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SNAKE>
<HAUK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Straight just like I said.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAUK>
<SNAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll think about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SNAKE>
<HAUK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No time. Give me an answer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAUK>
<DIRECTION>
Snake turns away. Hauk is pushing way too hard, and Snake is determined to be in the driver's seat.
</DIRECTION>
<SNAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get a new president.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SNAKE>
<HAUK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're still at war, Plissken. We need him alive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAUK>
<SNAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't give a fuck about your war... or your president.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SNAKE>
<HAUK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that your answer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAUK>
<SNAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm thinking about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SNAKE>
<HAUK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Think hard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAUK>
<DIRECTION>
Snake pauses to take a draw on his cigarette. Next question:
</DIRECTION>
<SNAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SNAKE>
<HAUK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You flew the Gullfire over Leningrad. You know how to get in quiet. You're all I've got.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAUK>
<SNAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess I go in one way or the other. Doesn't mean shit to me. Give me the paper.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SNAKE>
<HAUK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When you come out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAUK>
<SNAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Before.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SNAKE>
<HAUK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you I wasn't a fool, Plissken.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAUK>
<SNAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Call me Snake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SNAKE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WEAPONS ROOM -- NIGHT Rehme talks as we PAN ACROSS a table full of weapons. We see two guns, a belt, grenades, several pouches full of various stuff, a flashlight, a Uzi, throwing stars, and more. Snake surveys them with a cool expression.
</DIRECTION>
<REHME>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some of them have cars. They took old junkers that were left behind and converted them to steam. We think they may also have a gasoline source in there, and power. Greenhouses, rigged up generators. Some areas have streetlights. The crazies. Live in the subways. Complete control of the underground. They're night raiders.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REHME>
<DIRECTION>
Snake's not into this. He'll figure it out when he gets there. He picks up a bracelet with an eagle on it.
</DIRECTION>
<HAUK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tracer. Sends a radio signal for fifteen minutes. You push it, we can track you on radar. Just like Leningrad. But they added something. A safety catch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAUK>
<DIRECTION>
Snake pushes the safety catch. Simple enough. And yes, there's the button. This is familiar. He smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALL -- NIGHT Snake has his jacket slung over his shoulder now. He walks down the hall to the medical room with Hauk. Rehme has disappeared.
</DIRECTION>
<SNAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where am I landing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SNAKE>
<HAUK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Top of the world trade center. Only place you can land. They won't see it, and you can take off from a free fall. On the roof there's a service elevator. It's still operational. We use it to infiltrate the prison. There's a power box. It'll activate the elevator down to fifty. From there on down you walk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAUK>
<DIRECTION>
Snake shrugs on his jacket. He knows Hauk is just trying to assert his authority, and it's not working very well.
</DIRECTION>
<HAUK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can locate the President by his vital signs bracelet, on his wrist. It sends out a sig pulse. Use this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAUK>
<DIRECTION>
He hands Snake a homing device.
</DIRECTION>
<HAUK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Homing device. Shows directions and distance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAUK>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MEDICAL ROOM -- NIGHT Snake and Hauk walk into the room. They're met by a young medic.
</DIRECTION>
<HAUK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Strong antitoxin. Stops bacteria and viral-proofs you for 24 hours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAUK>
<DIRECTION>
Snake braces himself against a table. The medic is holding an injection-type tech gizmo.
</DIRECTION>
<MEDIC>
	<DIALOGUE>

	I don't like needles.

<HAUK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's about the survival of the human race, Plissken. Something you don't give a shit about.

Hauk steps aside. The medic swabs Snake's neck on both sides.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to inject you. It'll sting for a second or two...

<SNAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did you do to me, asshole?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SNAKE>
<HAUK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My idea, Plissken. Something we've been fooling around with. Two microscopic capsules lodged in your arteries. They're already starting to dissolve. In twenty-two hours, the cores will completely dissolve. Inside the cores are that heat-sensitive charge. Not a large explosive. About the size of a pinhead. Just big enough to --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he gestures)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	open up both your arteries. I'd say you'd be dead in ten or fifteen seconds --

Hauk stops talking because Snake has grabbed him by the throat.

<SNAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>

No one pays attention. Snake advances on Brain. Brain sits down.

<DIRECTION>
The two of them run off. After a while, Snake follows. The three of them hide. The Duke's car is an old Chrysler with chandeliers suspended over the headlights. It's in a caravan of three, leading the way. A fourth car comes up later. The Duke is sitting in the passenger seat of a car with Weirdo in the back. The Duke gets out of the car, Weirdo at his side. The Duke is wearing a cowboy hat, sunglasses, a snazzy jacket, bluejeans, and boots. He looks TOUGH. He sends Weirdo to knock on the door.

EXT. CAR -- NIGHT A lone man sits, looking bored. Snake subtly goes up to him, knocks him out, and gets him out of the car. He briefly considers shooting the guy on the hood of the car.

People start throwing bricks. Snake hands his gun to Brain, who passes it to Maggie, holding it like a dead rat (or like a macho guy would hold a purse). Snake drives as fast as he can, gunning off the bystander who gets on the car. A bystander grabs Brain.
</DIRECTION>
<BRAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maggie!

Maggie protects him. She shoots the people grabbing at him. Snake angles the car through a pile of scrap metal and drives away. He glares at Brain. Everyone seems visibly shaken.

Snake turns to face him. He stands up. We see for the first time exactly why he's called "Snake" Plissken. There's a snake tattooed on his stomach. The snake's tail disappears into his pants, but we have a good idea of where it leads and what it becomes. Ah ha.

Snake's life clock is gone. He has no idea how much time he's got. Shit.
