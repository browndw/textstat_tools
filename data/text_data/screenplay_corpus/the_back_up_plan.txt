It's POURING outside. The kind of rain that turns umbrellas inside out. NEW YORKERS run for cover with newspapers over their heads.

INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zoe is asleep with the morning sun on her face. Nuts is beside her, his two little, lame legs hanging off the pillow. Zoe opens her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a beat, she gets up and walks to the mirror. She lifts up her pajama top and looks at her stomach, sticking it out as far as it will go. It's flat as a board.
</DIRECTION>

INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seven WOMEN sit around the cramped living room of this small, East Village apartment. At least one woman is nursing a child that looks entirely too old to still be nursing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is the SINGLE MOTHERS BY CHOICE Support Group. CAROL, 40's, short hair, tank top and no bra, is the leader.
</DIRECTION>
<CAROL>

	Everyone, please say hello to Zoe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROL>
<EVERYONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Zoe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVERYONE>
<CAROL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Welcome to Single Mother's By Choice. As the name suggests, we are all single mothers by choice. Some of us have adopted, some conceived with a donor, every story is different, but with the same common denominator. We wanted to have a child, and we didn't need a partner to make it happen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROL>
<DIRECTION>
The women smile and nod. They are a proud, no-nonsense, somewhat masculine bunch. LORI, pregnant with a buzz cut, turns to Zoe.
</DIRECTION>
<LORI>

	Are you already a single mother or are you trying to become one?

	Oh, I guess I'm trying. I was just inseminated a few days ago.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Inseminated...makes me feel like a cow or something.

	Well, when we don't have partners with penises, we do what we've got to do, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, tell us a little bit about yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROL>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Let's see...um, I own a pet store on Hudson Street. Dogs, cats, rabbits...no birds, they creep me out. Before that, I worked for Google, which I completely hated. One day, I decided life was too short, and, against my accountant's advice, I quit Google, cashed out and bought the pet store. Now I'm really happy on the work front, but I still haven't found, you know, the one.

<CAROL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, yes. The elusive "one."

</CAROL>
<ZOE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<CAROL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Society tells us we're supposed to find that special person to make us happy and complete. But guess what...you have to create your own happiness. You don't need someone to complete you, some...man. You already are complete.

EXT. FARMER'S MARKET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Farmer's Market is crowded with people. We hear the sounds of a bluegrass band playing somewhere nearby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zoe spies the LITTLE GOAT sign. But Stan is not there. She looks around the neighboring stalls for him, but no luck.
</DIRECTION>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<DIRECTION>
She walks towards 14th street. We see the bluegrass band on the steps by the subway station. It's not a big band, just a few guys with an open banjo case and a sign that reads, "The Organics." The country twang of the music is in sharp contrast with the tall buildings all around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she gets closer, she notices that Stan is in the band. He's playing banjo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zoe quickly ducks into the nearest food stall, OLIVIA'S BERRIES. OLIVIA, mid-twenties, natural beauty, approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<OLIVIA>

	Can I help you?

Zoe watches Stan. She mindlessly starts eating some blueberries out of the display pint. Olivia sees that Zoe is looking at Stan.
</DIRECTION>
<OLIVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tasty, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVIA>
<DIRECTION>
Zoe nods and takes another berry.
</DIRECTION>
<OLIVIA>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All ripe and juicy. And firm, too. Bet you could just eat him up in one bite, right?

Zoe now turns, confused.
</DIRECTION>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<OLIVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And don't look now, but he's coming this way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVIA>
<DIRECTION>
Olivia winks and moves off. Zoe turns back and is now face- to-face with Stan, who's smiling from ear-to-ear, his banjo slung over his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A-ha! I didn't scare you away after all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN>
<ZOE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was just in the neighborhood. I thought I'd come by and get some blueberries. I'm going to make a pie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love blueberry pie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN>
<DIRECTION>
Stan takes two pints of blueberries and hands them to Zoe.
</DIRECTION>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm confused. I thought you made cheese or something.

</ZOE>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What makes you think I don't?

</STAN>
<ZOE>

</ZOE>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't someone do both?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honestly, I didn't know anyone did either.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>

Olivia returns.
</DIRECTION>
<OLIVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aren't you going to introduce me to your new friend?
	</DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on. Let me show you around.

EXT. THE LITTLE GOAT CHEESE STAND - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stan walks Zoe through his cheese stand.
</DIRECTION>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is our basic chevre, probably our best seller. The cheese that started it all, as they say. Then over here we have our surface- ripened cheeses. These are the aged/raw milk cheeses.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(realizing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is really boring, huh?

</STAN>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, not at all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's like you're in a foreign country and the only thing to watch on tv is a documentary on cheese. You don't want to watch it, but somehow you can't stop...

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think it's interesting. Really.

</ZOE>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, you asked for it...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(boring voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The aged/raw milk cheeses are made from raw milk and then aged for four to six months. Sometimes more. Sometimes less. Usually more. Depends on the cheese.

	Stop. You're killing me.

</FRED>
<ZOE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<FRED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be afraid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRED>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't scare her away. I'm trying to redeem myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN>
<FRED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then you should put down the banjo. You look like a doofus.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRED>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doofus?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then, to Zoe)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you think I look like a doofus?

	I don't really know what a doofus looks like.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>

Fred points to Stan.
</DIRECTION>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. If I put the banjo down, can I take you to lunch or something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I should really get back to work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, say the word and we can have a six-course tasting menu at Union Square Cafe. I know the chef.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That sounds nice, but, I should probably go.

	So what did Stan say?

</ZOE>
<BOBBY>

	He says to name any restaurant you want to go to. He'll be there with bells on.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

Nana gives her friends a nod, and they fall back several paces. Zoe waits for them to be out of earshot.

<NANA>

INT. NANA'S ROOM - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nana hands Zoe a cup of tea. Zoe's eyes well with tears.
</DIRECTION>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What am I going to do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<NANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm confused. Isn't this what you wanted? You bought sperm and were inseminated by your doctor. This isn't what we would call an accident.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NANA>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But now it's all happening so fast. Did I really think this through?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<NANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We talked about it for months. You said it was what you wanted more than anything in the world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NANA>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But this guy, he's...special. It's all going to fall apart now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<NANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What makes him so special?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NANA>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. He's very...real. And funny. And different. The other guys I've been with all had their briefcases and their five- year plans and their secretaries they were fucking. Stan doesn't have a five-year plan. I don't even know if he has a plan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<NANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about a secretary?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NANA>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>

	Well, if he's the right one, he'll stay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NANA>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you really think so?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<NANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gosh, I don't know. I hoped that would be enough to appease you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NANA>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Should I still visit him for the weekend? Or should I just vanish and hope he forgets I ever existed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<NANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be silly. Go up there for the weekend. Spend some time with him and see what he's really like.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NANA>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. You're right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<NANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You might find out he's a total douchebag and then the whole thing is moot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NANA>

Zoe looks at Nana. Douchebag?

<DIRECTION>
INT. CAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zoe is in the car. We are CLOSE on her as she talks rapidly and a bit maniacally.
</DIRECTION>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, so we'll just hope that he's a douchebag. Could happen, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<DIRECTION>
WIDEN to reveal Nuts in the passenger seat. He's yawning.
</DIRECTION>
<ZOE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. Am I keeping you up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<DIRECTION>
Nuts closes his eyes and lays down.
</DIRECTION>
<ZOE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My whole life is falling apart and you can't keep your bug-eyes open?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(yawning)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks. Now I'm yawning. But why am I so tired? I slept nine hours.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(thinks, then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I'm starving, too. What the hell is going on?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<DIRECTION>
Zoe sees a gas station and jams on the breaks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GAS STATION MINI MART - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zoe pours a massive cup of coffee. One of those gas station Big Gulp cups. Even the TRUCKER next to her chooses a smaller cup. Then, a look crosses her face.
</DIRECTION>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Am I even allowed to drink coffee?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<DIRECTION>
The trucker looks at her. She looks at him.

EXT. CAR - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zoe's car is now parked on the side of a highway in the middle of nowhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAR - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zoe is sound asleep with her head back and her mouth open. A small, empty coffee cup in her hand, crumpled candy bar wrappers on the floor, and an almost empty bag of Cheetos is in her lap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her cell phone RINGS. Zoe doesn't move. After the third ring, she lifts her head and looks around. It takes her a few moments to realize what's happened. She looks at the little coffee cup.
</DIRECTION>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks a lot, decaf.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<DIRECTION>
She picks up the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<STAN>

	Where are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN>

Zoe looks around.

<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have no idea.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LITTLE GOAT FARM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zoe bumps along the winding driveway of this idyllic Hudson River farm. There are red barns in the distance and green pastures filled with goats and sheep. The house is an old carriage house with a rusty weather-vane on top.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zoe parks the car and takes in the whole scene. Stan opens the front door, with a huge smile on his face. Zoe sighs.
</DIRECTION>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's so not a douchebag.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They enter the front door. Zoe takes in the charming carriage house.
</DIRECTION>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't believe you live here. This is ridiculous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just come on weekends. My parents really live here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Where are they now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In the kitchen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN>
<DIRECTION>
Zoe stops short.
</DIRECTION>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait, they're here? Now? Is this a "meet the parents" kind of thing? I wasn't prepared for this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Not at all. I mean, you'll meet them, but--
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When you said come up for the weekend, I assumed it was just us.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I need to lay down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STAN'S BEDROM - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zoe lies in the small bed with the covers pulled up to her chin. Stan stands above her with an odd look on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you hung-over or something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm just...not myself. Give me ten minutes. A ten-minute power nap and I'm good. I need to regroup.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you sure you're okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Zoe? Hello?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN>
<DIRECTION>
But she's already out. Stan gives her a little poke.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stan enters the kitchen. His parents, JOAN and EDWARD look up expectantly, as if about to meet their new daughter-in- law.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. It's just you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's taking a nap.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A nap? Now? She just got here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mom, I need you to not be judgemental, okay. I like this girl a lot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How can I be judgemental? We haven't even met her yet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<DIRECTION>
We hear a SQUEAK, SQUEAK, SQUEAK coming down the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the heck is that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<DIRECTION>
The SQUEAKING continues and then all eyes turn as Nuts rolls into the kitchen and stops. He tilts his head.
</DIRECTION>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. This is Nuts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN>
<DIRECTION>
Joan and Edward take in the raggedy/wheelchair-bound dog and then look at Stan. Stan shoots his mom a look.
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's judging?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STAN'S BEDROOM - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's now dark. Zoe is asleep in the exact same position. Suddenly, we hear a loud GRUMBLE. Her eyes open.
</DIRECTION>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<DIRECTION>
We hear the GRUMBLE again. It's her stomach. She puts her hands over it.
</DIRECTION>
<ZOE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<DIRECTION>
Zoe gets out of bed and goes right for the Cheetos. The bag is empty. She smears her hand on the inside of the bag and then licks the orange cheese from her fingers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zoe peeks out of the bedroom and looks both ways.
</DIRECTION>
<ZOE>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stan?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<DIRECTION>
No one in sight. She waits a beat and then whispers louder.
</DIRECTION>
<ZOE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stan!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zoe peers her head into the empty kitchen. Nuts is with her.
</DIRECTION>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stan? Hello?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<DIRECTION>
Zoe stands there unsure of what to do next. Then we hear her stomach GROWL again. Her eyes turn to the stove. Something smells out of this world. She tiptoes over and opens the pot. It's beef stew.
</DIRECTION>
<ZOE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, my God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<DIRECTION>
She makes sure the coast is clear and then looks for a spoon. She can't find one. She spies a loaf of white bread. Grabs a piece, folds it and then scoops up a heaping bite of stew and devours it.
</DIRECTION>
<ZOE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (mouth full)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, my God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<DIRECTION>
She replaces the lid on the pot. And now she just stands there. And stands there some more.
</DIRECTION>
<ZOE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, who am I kidding?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<DIRECTION>
She quickly takes two slices of bread and goes back in. This time, she uses one piece of bread as a ladle and then the other to turn it into a sandwich. She takes a huge bite.
</DIRECTION>
<ZOE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. My. God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<DIRECTION>
Stew dribbles down her chin. She takes a third piece of bread to wipe her face and then takes a bite of that one.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nuts starts to whine and beg. Zoe uses her bread-ladle to toss some stew on the floor for him. It lands with plop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And now Joan enters. Zoe and Nuts turn, their mouths bursting. Joan doesn't quite know what to do. All she knows is she's supposed to be open-minded.
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you like a plate?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<DIRECTION>
Zoe shakes her head no. Wow. This is embarrassing.
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A napkin?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<DIRECTION>
Zoe nods her head. Joan gives her one. Zoe holds it over her mouth as she tries in vain to swallow this inhuman bite.
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm Joan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<DIRECTION>
Zoe nods. Still can't swallow the bite.
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you must be Zoe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<DIRECTION>
Zoe nods again. She tries to shake Joan's hand. It's the best she can do. Unfortunately, her fingers are fluorescent orange from the Cheetos powder. Joan pulls her hand back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DINING ROOM - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dining room is warm and lovely. There's faded wallpaper and an old stagecoach lamp serving as a chandelier. Despite the inviting room, Zoe looks very uncomfortable.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The stew is delicious, honey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, Mom, it's awesome.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN>
<EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
(to Zoe)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you ever in your life had stew like this? Come on, be honest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
Zoe looks at Joan. Joan smiles. It will be their secret.
</DIRECTION>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh...no. Never.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are having coffee and dessert in the living room. Things seem more comfortable now. Zoe actually looks like she might be enjoying herself. Nuts sits beside her.
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So are all the animals in your pet store...differently abled?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, you can say paralyzed. He doesn't mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, our pets are all in great shape. Purebreads mostly, but not from puppy mills.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those puppy mills are terrible. I read about them in the paper.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, that's actually how I ended up with Nuts. I bought him from this pet store near my house. Six months later, I had thousands of dollars in vet bills and had to put him in a wheelchair.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should have sued that place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought about it, but what was that really going to do? They were still going to sell inbred dogs. So...I took the money I made when I left Google and just bought the place figuring I would do better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You worked for Google?
	</DIALOGUE>

Zoe nods.

</STAN>
<ZOE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you made a lot of money and then bought a pet store?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN>
<DIRECTION>
Stan puts his arm around her and gives her a squeeze.
</DIRECTION>
<STAN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love that.
	</DIALOGUE>

<ZOE>

<JOAN>
<DIRECTION>
(to Edward)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That sounds like us, honey.

</JOAN>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's true.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Zoe)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When we bought this farm we just wanted to make cheese because we couldn't find anything we liked in the stores. And now, twenty years later, here we are...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sometimes in life you just have to take matters into your own hands. Make things happen your own way, you know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<DIRECTION>
Zoe forces a smile. If only they knew.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LITTLE GOAT FARM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The moon is full and fireflies dot the air as Zoe and Stan walk the grounds of the farm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nuts trots/rolls ahead of them in a different wheelchair. This one is more rugged, with mountain-bike-type wheels.
</DIRECTION>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't believe that Nuts has an off-road wheelchair.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's got one for snow, too. With little skis on the bottom.

Stan smiles and shakes his head.

	Are you making fun of me? Do you think I spoil him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I really think you're amazing. I mean, that story you told tonight. You just quit your whole professional life because of this little dog? Started your own business, just like that?

Zoe shrugs.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're very...unique.

	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I keep waiting for the other shoe to drop. Like, how can you be so perfect? Why are you even still single? I can't believe no one's snatched you up by now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I drive them all away, I guess.
	</DIALOGUE>

Stan takes her in his arms.

Zoe opens her mouth. She's got to tell him. Before this goes any further, she has to tell him.
</DIRECTION>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stan.

</ZOE>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on. There's something I want to show you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHEESE CAVE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's floor to ceiling wooden shelves all filled with cheese. Stan ceremoniously unwraps a wheel.
</DIRECTION>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's cheese.

</STAN>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can see that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a new kind of goat's milk we're using. I've been developing the recipe, and now it needs to age. It'll be ready for market in several months.

	<DIALOGUE>
	You named a piece of cheese after me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not just one piece. The whole line. This will forever in history be known as the Zoe. Unless, of course, it tastes like shit, and then we'll just scrap it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(with a wink)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<STAN>

	Because it's going to be fantastic. Sweet and sassy and very complex. Why do you think I'm calling it Zoe?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN>
<ZOE>

	No one's ever named a piece of cheese after me before.

The door to the dairy kicks open and Stan carries Zoe out. Her legs are around his waist and they are making out like crazy.

INT. HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stan carries Zoe up the stairs. They are tripping and kissing and now tearing at each other's clothes.

<DIRECTION>
INT. STAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stan throws Zoe on the bed and then peels off his shirt. His body looks amazing in the shadowy moonlight. Zoe lies there, looking at him before he jumps on top of her.
</DIRECTION>
<ZOE>
<DIRECTION>
(under her breath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're such a douchebag.

Zoe shakes her head and then melts into him.

INT. STAN'S ROOM - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are now on their backs staring at the ceiling. They look happy and worn out
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Their P.O.V. Those little glow-in-the-dark star stickers are all over the ceiling. There's barely any glow left.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stan lets out a big sigh as he looks at the "stars"...
</DIRECTION>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was amazing. I mean, like, totally and exceptionally, over-the- top, amazing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN>
<DIRECTION>
Zoe turns to him. Takes a deep breath.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I go first? `Cause if we're going to say the same thing, I want to say it first.

</STAN>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're not going to say the same thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, let me go, because this is really embarrassing, and I just have to say it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've dated a lot of women. I mean, not tons, but a lot. And, the thing is, I've never...been in love before. I've never even told anyone I love them before. Because I just never felt it. But from the day we met, from the first time our backs accidentally touched in the subway, I feel this, this...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he shakes his head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe this is too much to say right now, but...I love you, Zoe. I really do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN>
<DIRECTION>
Stan finishes. He looks at her and smiles. Zoe just stares at him.
</DIRECTION>
<STAN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In my mind, you were supposed to say, I love you, too.

Instead, Zoe covers her mouth and runs to the bathroom. A beat later, we hear her vomit.

Zoe is at the sink, furiously brushing her teeth. Stan enters.

Zoe shakes her head.

</STAN>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>

</ZOE>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know who the father is. I kind of know him. I just don't know his name exactly. It was sort of anonymous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anonymous?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's a donor. From a sperm bank.

	Seriously, what the fuck are you talking about? Sperm bank? What?

</STAN>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>

</ZOE>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When did all of this happen?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The day we met. That same day. And I didn't tell you because I didn't think there was any way I could be pregnant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But...why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because supposedly with frozen sperm it takes a few tries and...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, why would you do this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I wanted a baby. And I'm almost forty, and I never met the right guy. I was afraid if I waited any longer it would all pass me by, and I'd miss my chance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<DIRECTION>
Stan just looks at her. Speechless.

	Don't say it like that. You make it sound dirty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. I...I'm stunned. I don't know what to say. What the fuck am I supposed to say?! This is great fucking news? Congratulations?! Why did you wait so long to tell me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I'm freaking out, okay! I didn't know what to do. I made this big decision to do this and then I met you--
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, what am I supposed to do now? This isn't how it was supposed to be. This isn't what--
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. I'm sorry, okay? Life isn't perfect. It's not all neat and tidy like your perfect family and your perfect farm and your bluegrass band. It's messy. It's fucked up. This is real life, okay? I'm sorry to break it to you.

They both stand there. After the raised voices, the silence feels more pronounced.

Zoe lies in bed awake. Nuts is beside her. They are alone.

Stan lies awake in a small guest room. Joan enters and is startled to find him in there.

Zoe sits in the passenger seat with the key in the ignition. Stan leans against the car. They are both quiet.
</DIRECTION>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know what to say.

<DIRECTION>
Neither does Stan, who says nothing. He runs his foot back and forth in the gravel.
</DIRECTION>
<ZOE>

(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess I'd given up on meeting someone like you, and I did what I thought was best.

EXT. MONA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Zoe stands in the hallway of Mona's apartment building. A beat later, Mona opens the door and holds out her arms.
</DIRECTION>
<MONA>

	Come here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONA>
<DIRECTION>
Zoe walks slowly into her embrace. They stand like this for a long time. Just holding each other. Until Mona's three kids run out with wiffle-ball bats and chase each other down the hall. A beat later, the toddler runs after them crying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zoe lies in bed with Nuts. She opens her eyes and stares at the ceiling. Then, with a sigh, she gets up and does her morning ritual.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls up her nightgown and sticks out her stomach. For the first time, we actually see a little bump.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EXAM ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>

Zoe lies on the table with a paper gown over her lap. She looks down at her feet in the stirrups. Sadly, we notice a perfect pedicure.

Dr. Harris comes in with a big smile.

	Well, your hormones aren't helping, and going through this without a partner must be difficult.

Dr. Harries readies the ultrasound wand and inserts the device. He turns the monitor so that Zoe can see.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_HARRIS>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, the good news is everything looks great. You are now eight weeks pregnant, which is an important milestone. With a little luck, we should be able to see a heartbeat today.

On the screen we see a small flickering dot. Dr. Harris smiles.

<ZOE>

Saying these words out loud for the first time hits Zoe. Tears fill her eyes.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you ever met a guy and you get butterflies and you think this is the kind of man who could take care of me forever? The kind of guy who makes you re-examine everything? Like, maybe I can be a stay-at-home mom and be barefoot and pregnant.

Stan leans against the bar with a beer in hand. He is watching all of the Farmer's Market girls and his co-worker, Fred, on the dance floor. Everyone looks drunk and happy.

<STAN>

	I also don't know what you really like to eat and what's just a craving, or when you start laughing hysterically and then crying and you say, this isn't me, if that's true because I don't really know the real you. All I know is the pregnant you.

INT. ZOE'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zoe sits on the floor of the living room sifting through a box of photographs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We FOLLOW her back into the bedroom and onto the bed. As Stan slowly opens his eyes, she holds up a photograph.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His P.O.V. It's a picture of a woman's ass.
</DIRECTION>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is my old ass.

Stan blinks a few times. His eyes adjusting.
</DIRECTION>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you have a picture of your ass?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My college boyfriend took it. So, I guess in fairness, my ass doesn't look exactly like this anymore, but it's pretty close. It's held up.

</ZOE>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a nice ass.

</STAN>
<ZOE>

</STAN>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This period, as horrible as it was, made me who I am. I think every person should go through a hideously ugly phase. It builds character.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It also taught me that I should never, under any circumstances, have short hair and a perm again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>

She picks up another picture. It's Zoe in a bathing cap and Speedo. She's holding up a yellow ribbon and has her arm around Nana.
</DIRECTION>
<ZOE>

<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fifth place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN>

	</DIALOGUE>

The next picture is a Halloween shot of Bobby, Mona and Zoe. Bobby is all in green, Zoe is all in yellow and Mona is in regular clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<ZOE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These are my best friends, Bobby and Mona. Mona and I met in high school and Bobby passed out on my couch in college and never left. You haven't met them yet because they might scare you away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are you dressed like that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Halloween. We were supposed to be a traffic light but Mona bagged out at the last minute and so Bobby and I just look like idiots. That's typical Mona, by the way.
	</DIALOGUE>

Zoe puts the picture down and picks up another. It's a woman in a hospital bed. She's giving the thumbs up sign.

<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You look just like her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the last picture of her that I have. She lived for a few more years, but we never took any pictures because she didn't want us to remember her like that. I was eight when she died.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I...can't imagine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She had a great laugh. And really soft hands. She used to rub my back before I went to sleep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>

Zoe puts the picture on the bedside table, propping it up next to her clock.
</DIRECTION>
<STAN>

Stan takes her hand, and they stay like that for a while. Just holding hands on the floor of her moonlit room. Finally, the silence is broken by the telephone RINGING.

Zoe and Stan enter the lobby of an old building in Tribeca.

	I'm confused. Why did you say you would come witness this birth in the first place?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. Seemed like a good idea at the time. I was trying to get back in their good graces. Go home. I'll meet you there. I don't want them to see you anyway.

	It's four in the morning. I'm not letting you walk home alone.

There are candles everywhere and a table of food and drinks. Kind of like a birthing cocktail party. Zoe eats a brownie.

Carol approaches with Lori, who is wearing a caftan and rubbing her large stomach. They all hug.

Zoe and Stan turn just in time to see the baby emerge and plop into the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CU of the baby in the dirty water still attached to the umbilical cord.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CU of Zoe and Stan's horrified faces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zoe's eyes roll back and we:
</DIRECTION>

FADE TO BLACK.

<DIRECTION>
OVER BLACK we hear silence. Blessed silence. No drums. No chants. No screams. Nothing. Until, we hear the SPLASH.

INT. LORI'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

WIDEN to reveal that Zoe is lying in the inflatable pool. Her eyes go from side to side. The horror of the situation becoming clear. A spongy, purple thing floats by.

	What is that?

FADE TO BLACK.

EXT. 14TH STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
14th street is just coming to life as the FARMERS start to unload their wares.

Zoe and Stan head up the street slowly, wearily, like soldiers back from battle.

At the same time, Zoe notices the post-it on the pie. It says, SORRY ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

	Flustered?

The minute he says this, he wishes he could take it back. Zoe just looks at him. She shakes her head.

	You know, all this time you're trying to figure out who the real me is, but who the fuck are you?
	</DIALOGUE>

Zoe and Mona are at their usual table. Zoe looks like she hasn't slept.

	Do you really think something happened with the berry girl? They both said nothing happened.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONA>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, are they going to come out and tell me? And that's not even the point. He said, the babies weren't his. And if he says that, he thinks that. And if he thinks that, he's not really committed.

</ZOE>
<MONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, now you run?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONA>
<ZOE>

	Why should I stick around for the end of the story when I know what it's going to be?

	What? If you want to say something, say it.

</MONA>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You haven't even met him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<MONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, and don't think I don't know the reason for that. You were never going to see this through, Zoe. Never. It was doomed before it began. Just like all of your relationships. You get out before you get hurt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONA>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't think I'm hurt right now?

	You don't know what you're talking about.

</MONA>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leave Nana out of this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<MONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's never going to marry him. Just like you'd never marry Stan. No wonder you ended up with a sperm donor. He'll never let you down. It's your ideal boyfriend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONA>

Zoe's face changes. She looks incredibly hurt.
</DIRECTION>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I used a donor because I wanted a baby.

</ZOE>
<MONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. I went too far.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONA>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I wanted to have a family. Because Nana is the only one I've got and she's eighty-four years old. And then it will just be me. So, yeah, you went a little too far.

Zoe leaves Mona at the table.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't say that. That's not true.

	You're not good for me. You made me think I needed you, and I don't.

	So that's it? Because of one stupid, asinine thing that I said, it's all over? This is how it ends?

	Yes. This is how it ends.

After a long beat, she puts it on her bedside table, next to the one of her mother. The two pictures, side-by-side make up a family. Zoe and her father in one shot and her mother from the hospital bed giving the thumbs up sign in the other.
