CLOSE ON an ornate ring. It's intricately carved with a seal, an image of St. Peter casting a net. The ring is carried on a satin pillow through a darkened, regal apartment. In the distance, BELLS ARE TOLLING -- the slow, solemn tones that announce a death.

A dozen men in scarlet cassocks, ROMAN CATHOLIC CARDINALS, bend down to inspect the ring, nodding in affirmation, part of an ancient ritual.

A younger man (the CAMERLENGO) in a black cassock takes a silver knife and scratches the ring's seal twice, once horizontally and once vertically, in the sign of the cross.

Now the ring is placed on a lead block. The Camerlengo raises a silver mallet and SMASHES it down, shattering the ring into a thousand tiny pieces.

They turn a corner and approach a squat stone building labeled "Offizia della Guarda Suiza."

TWO SWISS GUARDSMEN are standing outside the entrance to the building. They're somewhat comically dressed in puffy tunics vertically striped in brilliant blue and gold, with matching pantaloons and spats, topped by a black beret.

Langdon can't completely hide a smile. Olivetti notices. The Guards raise their eight-foot swords, allowing the three of them to enter the building.

INT SWISS GUARD HEADQUARTERS DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The headquarters of the Swiss Guard is in a lushly adorned Renaissance library crammed with sophisticated communications and surveillance equipment. It's crowded, Swiss Guard (in suits and ties, the pantaloons are more for show), uniformed Carbinieri, and Vatican Police crammed around different stations, some working together, others arguing, mostly in Italian.

While they confer, Langdon notices a woman to his left. We recognize Vittoria Vetra, the physicist we saw at CERN.

She catches Langdon's eye, forces a grim smile, recognizes they're both strangers here. Olivetti comes back with COMMANDER ROCHER, the tall man, very much in charge. He speaks with a French/Swiss ACCENT·

AT THE MONITOR,

<DIRECTION>
Langdon and Olivetti join Rocher and Vittoria and stare at the image on a video monitor -- it's a familiar-looking canister, in which a metallic drop of liquid shimmers in the middle, suspended. The acronym CERN is stenciled up its side. On its base is an LED display, counting down from about six hours.

A few moments later, they're crowded around the communications console at Rocher's desk, where a dimly-lit video recording is playing back on a computer screen. (The office is behind a glass wall to one side of the headquarters.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The images on the recording are of FOUR OLDER MEN, some in their sixties, the others in their seventies, filmed in dim light behind bars in a dank, dungeon-like space.

A lightly accented VOICE speaks from behind the camera.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you guys read your own history? 1668. The church kidnapped four llluminati scientists and branded their chests with the symbol of the cross. To "purge their sins." Murdered them and left their bodies in the street as a warning to others to stop questioning church rulings on scientific matters. It was after La Purga that a darker, more violent llluminati emerged. This sounds like retribution.

	The Path of Illumination is an ancient trail through Rome that leads to the Church of the Illumination, a secret place where llluminati members could meet in safety. If I can find the Segno, the sign that marks the start of the Path, I'm willing to bet the four churches along it are where he intends to murder your cardinals. If we can get to one of them before he does, we can stop it. But to find the start of the path, I need to get into the Archives.

A spectacular view of St. Peter's Square, through the windows of the Papal offices. Moving down, we find a figure dressed in a simple black cassock, his back to us, staring out at the crowd. FATHER SEBASTIAN GUTTIEREZ, the Camerlengo, speaks with a soft Spanish accent.

In a dark space, a tea bag bobs delicately up and down in a cup of hot water. An elegant man in his forties, dressed in a casual suit, no tie, HUMS softly to himself as he steeps his tea. No idea of his name, but his suit is gray, so how about MR. GRAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tea is on an old wooden table, being heated by a small can of sterno. While Mr. Gray bobs the tea bag, he stares at something to his right.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Money. A lot of it, in a number of different denominations, neatly segmented in a briefcase. And three passports, all different colors (and nationalities), neatly placed on top of it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Satisfied, Mr. Gray CLICKS the briefcase shut and slides it under the table, tucking it up against the wall. He removes the cup from the heat, still bobbing the tea bag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks, lit by candlelight that throws harsh shadows on strange walls. He heads down a very dark hallway, past a row of stonewalled cells, and within each is the dimly lit figure of the older men we saw on the videotape earlier -- the kidnapped cardinals.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the front door of the church,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Langdon hops over the sawhorses blocking the entrance and tries the door. Locked. A sign says the place is under construction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At a side door,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Olivetti races alongside the church, followed by the others. He reaches a door with a large, heavy ring, and pulls it toward him. But the door won t budge. He pushes, throws his shoulder into it. Locked.

INT SANTA MARIA DEL POPOLO DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and the heavy door CLUNKS open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The interior of the church is an obstacle course of torn-up flooring, brick pallets, mounds of dirt. Silt drifts in the dying sunlight that shines through the broken windows and walls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing moves. Dead silence. Langdon and Vittoria walk slowly to the middle of the floor, at one end of the chapel. There are eight recesses, four on either side of a central aisle, all covered with large sheets of plastic, to protect them during construction.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Langdon gestures --- everybody quiet. Olivetti points to the left gestures to Langdon and Vittoria to go to the right.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They separate, to either side of the main aisle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE FIRST CHAPEL,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Langdon pulls the plastic aside, eyes scan the chapel. Nothing. ON THE OTHER SIDE,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Olivetti does the same, at another chapel. Nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE THIRD CHAPEL,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vittoria pushes the plastic aside, gun in front of her. There's a sudden movement to her left, she whirls --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--- and a rat scurries away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE FOURTH CHAPEL,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Langdon pushes the plastic aside, steps inside --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and GASPS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Moving behind him, we see a Christian chapel like no other we've ever seen. Finished entirely in chestnut marble, overhead it has a domed cupola with a field of illuminated stars and the seven planets (as known in Galileo's day).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Further down the wall, there are tributes to earth's four seasons but most incredible of all are the two huge structures that dominate the room from either side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pyramids. Ten feet high.

Vittoria steps in behind him.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Pyramids. In a Catholic church. This is it.

Behind them, the plastic rustles, as if drawn by a wind, and as Langdon turns, he hears, faintly, a DOOR CLOSING far away.
</DIRECTION>

He turns back, eyes drawn to the floor. There is a large oval medallion there, with a skeleton carved into it. It's slightly off center, raised. As if it's been opened recently, and hurriedly replaced.

Langdon squints, trying to see inside.
</DIRECTION>

Vincenzo hands him one. Langdon shines it down into the crypt. There are shapes, but thirty feet down and hard to make out.

There's one in particular, in the darkness, seems too short to be a person, but it's moving slightly.

Langdon reaches the bottom, still shining the light at the figure in the distance. It's brighter here, he can see it's flesh- colored, but still indistinct. He takes a step toward it --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and something CRUNCHES under his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He shines the light down. He's standing on a pile of human skulls

He takes two more steps, closer to the swaying figure on the other side of the crypt. He can now clearly see a man's naked back.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</LANGDON>
<DIRECTION>
It's a human figure. As Langdon draws close, he sees the source of the movement --- rats, gnawing at the dead body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They scurry away as Langdon comes around the front, and we pull back to see what he sees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's Cardinal Lamasse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's been buried in the earthen floor of the crypt up to his waist his jaw broken, his mouth crammed full of dirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But that's not the worst of it. Langdon GAGS as he sees the blackened word that has been branded into the red flesh of the Cardinal's chest. It's an ambigram, like we've seen before, but this time it says --

The African Cardinal stands, holds his ballot over his head, t lowers the ballot to the altar, where a plate sits atop a large chalice.

He places the ballot on the plate, then picks up the plate and uses it to drop the ballot in the chalice. He then replaces the plate over the chalice, bows to the cross, and heads for his seat.

The next cardinal steps up to repeat the process.

EXT CHURCH ROOF DUSK

<DIRECTION>
--- the roof of the old church, also undergoing renovation. The view of Rome is spectacular from up here, and Langdon rushes to the western wall, looking intently off in that direction.

He sees something that makes him suck in his breath, hears a voice from behind him ---

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A compass. He catches it, holds it steady, and walks toward the edge of the roof as the compass needle swivels and settles on SW.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Langdon looks up, following the line of the needle, up over the rooftops of Rome, to a massive structure in the distance, exactly in line with the compass needle.

A huge dome on the horizon blots out the setting sun.

	The black rectangles with crosses are churches, and none of them intersect the line until it comes to an end, right in the middle of St. Peter's Square.

Night has fallen, and the four Alfa Romeos are now speeding across Rome. No sirens, but lots of speed. Olivetti drives, Rocher is in the passenger seat.

EXT ST. PETER'S SQUARE NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
--- on a television monitor in St. Peter's Square. The Reporter, a JAPANESE WOMAN, is giving a stand-up report on the progress so far, gesturing to the chimney over the Sistine Chapel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd has grown, now four thousand, maybe five. FLASHBULBS POP. A few PROTESTERS CHANT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Almost silently, behind them all, half a dozen black Alfa Romeos race in, too fast, and come to an abrupt halt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN ROCHER'S CAR,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
they all get out, trying to avoid causing a panic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Langdon walks into the square, eyes focused on an object in the middle.
</DIRECTION>
<LANGDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Another obelisk. We're close.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANGDON>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up, at row after row of statues that ring the square from atop the oval colonnades.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHARPSHOOTERS scurry among the statuary, setting themselves up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the crowd, Rocher MUTTERS into his radio and to undercover SWISS GUARD scattered throughout. The crowd is unaware of them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Langdon keeps walking, turning in circles, looking above him, to the tops of the colonnades that border the square.

And indeed there are. Langdon looks at his watch. Two minutes to nine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then he freezes. Staring down, not up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a step back. There is a fresco carved into the square beneath his feet, or more accurately --
</DIRECTION>
<LANGDON>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bas relief!
	</DIALOGUE>

He takes a step back, to look at the carving, as does Vittoria.

	Look for more! Something having to do with air!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANGDON>
<DIRECTION>
They move through the crowd, pushing people aside, causing a bit of a ruckus as they try to uncover the elaborate carvings in the stone of the square.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(IF WE ARE EAGLE-EYED, at this point we will see TWO ROBED MEN, one helping the other, who carries a cross, as they pass through the crowd behind Langdon.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Remembering something, Langdon rushes forward, toward the center of the square, uncharacteristically brusque with the crowd, shoving his way through now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He draws close to one carving in particular, slows to a stop, and stares down at it, eyes wide.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a carving of an angel's face, cheeks billowing outward as it blows a gust of wind, symbolized by five vertical streaks. Its title is ---
</DIRECTION>
<LANGDON>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"West Ponente." The West Wind. An angel's face and five streaks. Air!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANGDON>
<DIRECTION>
So this is it, but now what? They look around frantically, scanning the crowd. So does Rocher, so does Olivetti. The BELLS of St. Peter's start to TOLL the hour.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEARBY,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
a LITTLE GIRL dances with a doll. Happily unaware of what's going on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELSEWHERE,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
some PROTESTERS tangle. Some believe one thing, others don't.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Swiss Guard and Vatican Police race in to break it up. But there's no bloodshed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE TO THAT,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
a ROBED MAN carrying a small wooden cross falls to the ground. Somebody near him SCREAMS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEARBY,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the Little Girl is jostled by a HOMELESS MAN, drops her doll.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE ROBED MAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is helped to his feet by the Police. He's fine. He wanders away, holding his cross high.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And as he passes us, we catch just a glimpse of his face ---
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--and recognize Mr. Gray.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE LITTLE GIRL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
bends down, picks up her doll, and sees --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- IT'S COVERED IN BLOOD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks down at the ground, sees a trail of blood, follows it with her eyes to where ---
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- the Homeless Man, dressed in torn rags, leans against a fountain, gasping for breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ACROSS THE CROWD,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vittoria and Langdon hear the SCREAMS. They're closest, and they're at the fountain in just a few seconds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Langdon drops to his knees, turns the Homeless Man over. Through the man's torn shirt, he can see a black and red brand burned into his chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Three letters, ornate script, reading the same front to back:
</DIRECTION>
<AIR>
<DIRECTION>
Vittoria grabs his arm, feels for a pulse.
</DIRECTION>
<VITTORIA>

</VITTORIA>

But the dying Cardinal is gasping for breath, his mouth opening and closing like a fish on a dock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She bends down, arches his neck, closes her mouth over his, and blows air into his lungs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Immediately, a fog of red mist BILLOWS from two puncture holes in the man's chest, covering Langdon in blood --- his face, his clothes.

Rocher arrives, as does Olivetti, as do a DOZEN MORE SWISS GUARD and VATICAN POLICE. Rocher looks around, defeated and enraged, as the Cardinal expires and the Crowd panics, fleeing in all directions.

He presses his radio to his lips and keys the mic.

Blood and water swirl down a drain. Langdon looks up from the sink, water rushing from his face. He dries himself, looks in the mirror. He holds up his hands. They're shaking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's standing in a lavish marble bathroom, now cleaned up and changed into black pants and a black long-sleeved shirt. No Roman collar, they don't just give you those, but clearly the clothes of a priest. He steps out of the bathroom and into ---

<DIRECTION>
INT PAPAL OFFICE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- the papal office, where the Camerlengo, Rocher, Olivetti, and Vittoria are gathered again, as are HALF A DOZEN other security officers. It's crowded, busy, little knots of jurisdictional arguments and competing theories around the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Camerlengo, at his desk, is stunned, speaking to Olivetti. Langdon edges close enough to hear, but not too close.

<CAMERLENGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When did this call come in?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMERLENGO>
<OLIVETTI>

</OLIVETTI>
<CAMERLENGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And he actually claimed responsibility for the death of His Holiness?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMERLENGO>
<OLIVETTI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not personally, but he said it was the Illuminati. He said they murdered him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVETTI>
<CAMERLENGO>

	That's ridiculous, the Holy Father died of a stroke. Did he say how they claim to have done it?

KA-CHUNG! Emergency lights switch on in the Vatican Archives, casting a weird, reddish glow over everything.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But the ribbons at the oxygen panel remain limp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Below, Langdon pushes, again and again, on the deadened exit button, trying to activate the doors. Nothing doing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's weak, weaving, barely on his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chartrand's already slumped against a wall, his radio in hand, keying it over and over again, but getting only static.
</DIRECTION>
<LANGDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anything?

Chartrand gestures weakly around the room.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARTRAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Walls... lead-lined... no signal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARTRAND>
<DIRECTION>
Langdon blinks, his vision becoming seriously impaired. He holds his eyes closed for a moment, opens them, it's not much better.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Langdon looks at the glass wall on the far side of the vault. Then at the row of bookcases. Gets an idea.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He goes to the last bookcase, which is about six feet from the glass wall. He hoists himself up on the shelf of the bookcase opposite it, wedges himself in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And pushes with one leg. The giant bookcase teeters, but just barely.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Langdon hoists himself further up, gets both legs up against the bookshelf.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pushes again -- more movement this time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now he puts everything he has into it, straining like hell. The bookcase starts to tip, goes just past the point of no return, starts to fall, gloriously headed straight for the glass wall, which it SLAMS into with enormous power and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--- stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leaning against the wall. Forget cracks, there's not even a scratch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Langdon CURSES under his breath, looks around for another idea.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He hears a soft THUD from the other side of the room, sees Chartrand has slumped over, unconscious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But his jacket has fallen open, revealing the sidearm he carries in a shoulder holster.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LANGDON'S HAND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
slips the gun out of the holster and hefts it. Safe bet he's never held one of these before.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He staggers over toward the glass wall, raises the gun, and pulls the trigger. Nothing happens. Trigger doesn't even move.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a moment of oxygen-poor thinking, he figures out how to CLICK off the safety. Tries again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(Pow.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of the shot is barely audible to Langdon. His brain's going fast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
If he was hoping to bring the whole wall down, he failed, but there's a faint HISSING sound coming from the bullethole, and he goes to it and takes a deep breath of air from the outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stands back, his brain clearing momentarily.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seized by an idea, he looks up at the wall, at its four corners, and at the tiny web of cracks radiating out from the hole he just made in the center.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He raises the gun again and fires off FOUR SHOTS in quick succession. They're in an odd pattern-- upper left corner, upper right, not quite as high, lower middle-left, and the very lower right corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now there are four new holes, each HISSING slightly, and the first hole, in the center.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shaking his head once more to clear it, Langdon steps forward to the glass wall, but instead of barreling against it or throwing a chair, he simply raises one hand, places it flat over the first hole he made, the one in the center of the glass wall ---
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and presses gently.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Almost immediately, a SHARP SOUND comes from the hole beneath his hand and a jagged crack leaps out from the first hole, shooting up to connect with the hole in the upper left corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He presses just a touch harder and a SECOND CRACK starts, shooting down to the lower right. Then a third, and a fourth, the glass is cracking like ice in springtime, all four extremities connecting with the central hole, and with a huge GROANING SOUND - -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- the entire glass wall falls to pieces at his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Air RUSHES into the vault.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And, wouldn't you know it, the power comes back on in the Archives.

-- their power goes out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two flashlights CLICK on, and the Guardsmen lead the way in. On both sides, hollow niches line the walls. Recessed in the alcoves, as far as the flashlights let them see, the hulking shadows of sarcophagi loom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On top of each tomb are life-sized marble carvings of each Pope, shown in death and wearing full papal vestments, arms folded across their chests.
</DIRECTION>

the Camerlengo closes the last few feet alone. He knees down in front of the bright marble carving, a likeness of the late Pope. He WHISPERS.

	Father... Holy Father... You told me when I was young that the voice in my heart was that of God. You told me I must follow it no matter what painful places it leads. I hear it now, asking me the impossible. Give me strength. Forgive me. What I do, I do in the name of everything you believe.

<DIRECTION>
A moment of silence, and then --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- they step forward. Set their flashlights on the floor. And step to the tomb. Bracing their hands against the marble covering near the head of the tomb, they plant their feet and push.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It doesn't move.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They push harder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vittoria and the Camerlengo join them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With an almost primal GROWL of stone on stone, the lid slides, rotating off the top of the casket and coming to rest at an angle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Camerlengo picks up a flashlight and shines it in the crypt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vittoria leans forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The light creeps up the Pope's body, over his burial vestments, past his folded hands, and finally to his face.

His cheeks have collapsed, the Pope's mouth gapes wide --

</LANGDON>
<DIRECTION>
He's pointing at a cleat, maybe ten feet up on the wall, where the right guide wire is attached.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vatican Cops 2 & 3 drag a half-burned pew out of the fire and pull it underneath, leaning it against the wall for greater height,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Langdon starts to climb it, to uncleat the wire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE DARKENED LEFT AISLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Olivetti creeps forward, gun at the ready, Vincenzo close behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They see a form on the floor in front of them and Olivetti bends down -- it's the first Vatican Policeman.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dead in a pool of his own blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vincenzo, standing behind Olivetti, looks down, horrified, and in that moment of distraction, a figure creeps up behind him --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and twists his head 180 degrees with one smooth motion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Olivetti whirls, but his gun comes around a split-second slower than he does and in that split-second a shadow falls over him, something SLASHES through the air and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE MAIN AISLE,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Langdon struggles to climb the pew that's leaned against the wall as Vatican Cop 4 finds a long-handled candle snuffer and races toward the edge of the fire with it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blinking back the intense heat, he manages to hook the Cardinals manacled foot with it, he turns to Langdon--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- who, stretched as far as he possibly can, just manages to loose the wire from its cleat, holding tightly to it so as not to let the Cardinal go into free-fall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But the pew on which he's balanced starts to wobble, then- --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- BLAM! BLAM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two gunshots THUD into the chests of Vatican Cops 2 & 3, who were supporting the pew. They fall, the pew tips --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and Langdon, falling --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- loses his grip on the chain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Cardinal falls toward the flames. Vatican Cop 4 tries to pull him to safety, but doesn't have enough of WHIRRS through the pulley until it reaches its the Cardinal to an abrupt stop, six feet lower
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and directly in the middle of the bonfire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His SHRIEK of agony echoes through the burning church.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Langdon SLAMS to the floor just at the edge of the burning church pews, maybe CRACKING a rib on the hard floor of the church.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FIGURE steps out of the shadows, looming over him, Langdon looks up, expecting a gunshot, but instead --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- sees the bleeding figure of Olivetti, staggering toward him, clutching his slit throat in his last moments of life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEARBY,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vatican Cop 4 is desperately trying to pull the Cardinal from the flames, the end of the candle-snuffer is now hooked around the Cardinal's foot, he pulls him closer, reaches out, can almost grab his ankle --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- until he is SHOT in the back. He falls to the floor, drawing and dropping his gun in the process, losing his grip on the long-handled pole as well.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the ground, bleeding, he sees his gun, just a foot away from his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches for it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And a foot steps on his wrist, BREAKING it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Gray stands over him, implacable.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FROM A DISTANCE,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
we see Mr. Gray fire two shots into the ground where Cop 4 is lying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he turns toward us.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEARBY,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Langdon, still on the ground, looks up at the sound of the shots. Through the burning church pews he can see Mr. Gray, starting toward him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Langdon crawls, on all fours, through the outskirts of the bonfire, toward a recessed part of the wall ten or fifteen feet away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Gray steps up behind him, raises his gun --
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Polizia!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
-- and turns. TWO MORE COPS, Roman Carbinieri, have run into the burning church and are making their way down the center aisle, straight toward him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Gray raises his left (non-gun holding) hand, displaying a leather billfold with a badge in it.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_GRAY>
<DIRECTION>
(good Italian accent)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gendarmeria Vaticano!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_GRAY>
<DIRECTION>
Recognizing the ID, the two Cops glance away for a second, to search the rest of the church --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and Mr. Gray BLASTS two shots into each of them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They drop, dead, but one of them squeezes off a single round before falling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Gray looks down, at his right shoulder, where a dark red stain is spreading on his suit. He touches it, more annoyed than anything.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNDERNEATH THE BURNING PEWS,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Langdon has crawled as close as he dares to the raging fire, and the sleeve of his shirt is ablaze. He rolls out the other side of the embers, stamping out the flames, gets to his feet, and takes off running.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Gray pursues, only slowing his gait slightly to DOUBLE TAP two shots into the head of a dying Vatican Cop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ACROSS THE CHURCH,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Langdon hurls himself over a balustrade and into a chapel on the far side of the church. Bullets SHATTER the glass of an elevated crypt, three feet off the floor. (Inside is a superbly detailed wax statue of a saint in death.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Langdon dives under it and crawls backwards, staring in horror at Mr. Gray's feet as they approach the chapel from across the church.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Langdon's back THUDS into a wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dead end.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But there's an old wooden grating in the wall. He turns, KICKS it with both feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The grating CRUNCHES into pieces, revealing a narrow crawlspace
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE CRAWL SPACE,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Langdon army-crawls through it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Gray's face appears in the entry to the crypt. He pauses to change clips on his handgun --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- the floor beneath Langdon abruptly runs out --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Mr. Gray raises his gun --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and Langdon disappears. The gunshots THUD into cement wall where he was, not where he is.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNDERGROUND,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Langdon CRUNCHES to a hard landing on a subterranean stone floor, rolls over, and sees Mr. Gray above him, now pointing down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But there's another crawl space, and Langdon scurries into it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE SECOND CRAWL SPACE,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
it's hopelessly dark, an even tighter space than the last one, filled with cobwebs that Langdon blindly claws his way through.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He hits another hole in the floor, falls a second time ---
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTO THE CATACOMB,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and lands on top of a pile of long-decayed skeletons in the nearly-black bottom of the church's underground warren of hiding places.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up. He's ten feet from the nearest handhold, only a fool would follow him down here
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK UP IN THE BURNING CHURCH,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and Mr. Gray is no fool. He steps back over the balustrade and leaves the chapel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The waxen face of the carving in the sarcophagus melts in the intense heat of the out-of-control fire.

Commandante Rocher is at his desk, Vittoria's leather-bound journals on the desk in front of him. He's studying them carefully, and seems troubled by what he reads.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the glass walls of his office, we can see a commotion in the still-chaotic Swiss Guard headquarters. Someone is walking toward us, briskly, a WOMAN'S VOICE complaining loudly in Italian.
</DIRECTION>

Rocher calmly places the journals on top of the screen of the video monitor inlaid in his desk, the one we saw earlier, with a keyhole where a power switch should be.

He pushes a button and the monitor rotates shut, into an inlaid panel in the desk's surface. It closes just after --

<DIRECTION>
INT SANTA MARIA DELLA VITTORIA NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As FIREMEN put out the last of the flames (not using water, but Halon gas, which creates no steam), a metallic TAPPING sound comes from somewhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the Firemen approaches another, gets his attention -- stop what you're doing and listen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They shut down a hose and stop, listening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There it is again. They SHOUT in Italian to the others, now everybody shuts down their hoses and listens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The metallic TAPPING echoes in the smoldering church.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They walk toward it -- it's coming from an oval plate in the floor, like a manhole cover, heavy and carved. We've seen one of these before, it leads to a Demon's Hole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The TAPPING is louder now, rhythmic. Somebody's down there. Crowbars are produced, the cover of the Demon's Hole is pried off and shoved aside, revealing --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Robert Langdon, wedged into the top of the opening, holding a rock in one hand as he clings precariously to the walls he has climbed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Strong hands reach down, haul him to his feet --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE FRONT OF THE CHURCH,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and those same feet hurry to the front of the smoldering church, coming to a stop in front of --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Bernini's Ecstasy of St. Teresa.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The statue he came here to find. Now, as the Italian-speaking police and firemen work around him, Langdon moves, as if in his own world. He looks to the statue, repeating fragments of the poem he has by now memorized:
</DIRECTION>
<LANGDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let angels guide you on your lofty quest...

His finger travels over the map and --

we watch as his finger crosses church after church after church, tiny black boxes with crosses in them. There must be two dozen.

EXT PIAZZA NAVONA NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Piazza Navona is lightly peopled on this soft summer night with so much attention directed toward the Vatican.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hood of a car glides into view, nearly silent, on the far side of the fountain. Langdon and the two Roman Cops step out and survey the area.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Langdon looks to the fountain. Its central core is twenty feet tall, a rugged mountain of marble with caves and grottoes through which water churns. Atop it stands an obelisk that climbs another forty feet.

</ROMAN_COP>
<DIRECTION>
But the Cop stops mid-sentence as he notices the black van parked on the far side of the fountain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Silently, the Cops gesture to each other to go opposite ways around the fountain, and to Langdon to stay where he is.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Langdon, frustrated but no action hero, watches them as they slowly encircle the van.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE DRIVER'S SIDE,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the First Cop approaches the Driver's Window, sees Mr. Gray sitting implacably behind the wheel. He taps lightly with a knuckle, his drawn gun at his side, just out of view.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Gray opens the window.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_GRAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Si?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_GRAY>
<DIRECTION>
The Roman Cop looks down, ever so briefly, at a small spreading bloodstain on Mr. Gray's shirt. When he looks back up --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- there is a silenced pistol pointing directly at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PHOOM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a bullet in the forehead, slumps forward against the window, and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FROM A DISTANCE,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
we see his body pulled rapidly into the van through the driver's window. Whole thing took about three seconds. DINERS at an outdoor cafe don't even notice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FROM LANGDON'S POINT OF VIEW,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
on the other side of the fountain, the van rocks slightly, but he can't see anything out of the ordinary.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns, looks to the Second Cop, who is just now approaching from the rear of the van.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WITH THE SECOND COP,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
this one's got his gun in front of him, he's ready for anything. We creep around the back of the van with him, and just as he comes around to where he can see the driver's side --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- the barrel of the silencer presses into his forehead. A quick exchange in Italian:
</DIRECTION>
<SECOND_COP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Per favore?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECOND_COP>
<MR_GRAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Non posso.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_GRAY>
<DIRECTION>
PHOOM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another bullet, another slumping Cop, and
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FROM LANGDON'S POINT OF VIEW,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the van rocks again, but he can't see anything more detailed than that. All he knows is the two cops aren't coming out from the other side of the van, something is going on --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and the bell in the clock tower starts to BONG.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EVEN UNARMED, LANGDON STARTS TO MOVE FORWARD, JUST AS --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- the sliding door on the fountain side of the van SLAMS open
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- revealing the figure of the FOURTH CARDINAL, wrapped in chains and with manacled hands and feet. He thrashes against the iron links, but the chains are too heavy. One of the links bisects his mouth like a horse's bit, stifling his cries for help. Mr. Gray hovers over him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Langdon GASPS --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and Mr. Gray shoves the bound figure roughly out of the van.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Cardinal rolls, falling into the fountain with an enormous SPLASH. His weighted body sinks immediately to the bottom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a moment, frozen in time, in which Langdon locks eyes with Mr. Gray, still hunched in the back of the van as the clock tower continues to BONG, the only sound we can hear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Langdon looks at him, then down at the body in the fountain, then back up at Mr. Gray--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- who salutes him ---
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- the van door SLAMS shut, and the van tears ass out of there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Langdon looks from its receding taillights to the idling police car, its door hanging open, he could jump in and give chase, but then his eyes go back to the fountain, where the drowning cardinal must not have much time left, and it's really no decision at all.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Langdon covers the distance to the fountain in two quick strides and leaps in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE FOUNTAIN,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the water is waist deep and like ice. Steady streams of bubbles rise up from the bottom, churning it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Langdon reaches the body of the Cardinal, plunges in --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNDERWATER,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and struggles to get both arms underneath the drowning man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the watery haze, we can see the man's bare chest, branded with the final ambigram:
</DIRECTION>
<WATER>
<DIRECTION>
Langdon struggles to lift him, but the weight is too much, he can barely get him a few inches off the bottom of the fountain, much less all the way to the surface.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Langdon, running out of air, bursts to the surface and -- ON THE SURFACE,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- takes a deep breath, then plunges back --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNDERWATER,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- but he still can't move the Cardinal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He makes eye contact with the dying man, who seems to be accepting his fate, maybe even welcoming it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Langdon changes his grip, strains like hell, and actually gets him a few inches higher this time, but nowhere close to the air supply.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But with the new position, his eyes fall on something behind the cardinal -- a plastic tube, six inches across, streaming bubbles into the fountain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He goes back --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ABOVE THE SURFACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- takes another breathy and sees the fountain of bubbles rising up to the surface just above the tube. Air!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Several PASSERS-BY notice the commotion in the fountain as Langdon dives back under the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNDERWATER,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Langdon drags the body of the Cardinal a few feet across the bottom of the fountain and RIPS the tube free from its mooring, pulling it to the Cardinal's mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He clamps it down over the man's lips, and the Cardinal sucks a few greedy breaths from it. Enough to keep him alive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Langdon takes the tube and draws a couple breaths of his own, then digs his hands back underneath the Cardinal to lift him, but this time --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- SIX MORE HANDS come in from all sides.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Several Passers-by have jumped into the fountain to help, and as they all strain together --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE SURFACE,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- the Cardinal's bound body breaks the surface and he GULPS deep lungfuls of air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is saved. Langdon sags against the side of the fountain, exhausted and freezing, as the others pull the Cardinal's body to safety.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the distance, SIRENS.

Langdon, gathering himself, goes to the Cardinal, speaks in rapid Spanish, subtitled.

EXT CASTEL SANT'ANGELO NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We fly over a bridge, flanked by a dozen angel statues standing sentinel on either side, leading directly toward--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- the Castel Sant'Angelo, Castle of the Angels, its ancient stone ramparts lit by floodlights. Soaring swiftly up its facade, we close in on a mammoth bronze angel standing atop the citadel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It points the way, all right, its sword aimed directly downward, at the castle itself, as if to say you've found it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DOWN ON THE GROUND,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
several Police Cars come to a stop in front of the castle at the same time.

Cops pour into the courtyard of the castle. Langdon and Vittoria follow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT CASTEL SANT'ANGELO - COURTYARD NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They dash around the outer bulwark of the Castle. The courtyard beneath them looks like a museum of ancient warfare -- catapults, stacks of marble cannonballs, fearful contraptions.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the Cops quickly and silently search every nook, Langdon and Vittoria follow closely.
</DIRECTION>
<LANGDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Vatican used this place for centuries as a hideout, a prison for enemies of the church -- there are passages and catacombs everywhere. It makes sense, the Illuminati infiltrated the Church's own stronghold. Bernini was chief architect here, he left clues everywhere, it's even surrounded by a pentagonal park!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANGDON>
<DIRECTION>
They reach the central core of the castle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another angel statue, similar to the one atop the citadel, stands in front of them, its sword held in the same position, pointing downward at an angle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Langdon studies it, follows the line of the angel's sword -- and sees a gated drive that cuts across the courtyard itself.

he and Vittoria are down in the courtyard, at the mouth of the gated drive. The gate is open and leads to a tunnel, a gaping entry in the central core.
</DIRECTION>
<LANGDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A traforo. Commanders on horseback used them to ride directly into a castle from the outside.

He gestures to the nearby Cops, who are already on it, and they all head into the darkened tunnel.

<DIRECTION>
INT TUNNEL NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Police flashlights switch on and their beams bounce crazily off the walls of the tunnel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Footsteps CRUNCH as they all press in, Langdon and Vittoria content to let men with guns lead the way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It gets darker as they descend, and then, by the echo of their footfalls, they can tell they've entered --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LARGE CHAMBER.

<DIRECTION>
More lights are switched on, illuminating the space, which terminates in three stone walls.
</DIRECTION>
<LANGDON>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
But the Police attention is focused on the black van parked in the center of the room.
</DIRECTION>

Roman Police snap into action, flashlight beams bounce everywhere, guns point in every possible window of the van, SHOUTS for whoever's inside to get the hell out now, now, now.

The doors are flung open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The van is empty.
</DIRECTION>

Except for the two dead policemen from the Piazza Navona.

Vittoria borrows a flashlight from one of the two remaining Cops, who now get a CRACKLY MESSAGE on their walkie-talkies and race out of the tunnel, toward the top, leaving Langdon and Vittoria alone in the dead end.

She brings the light to Langdon, who shines its beam down at the floor. There, in the corner, is a granite block.

But as he shines the light, there's something off about the shadow it casts in the corner of the room. It creates an odd, dark slit.
</DIRECTION>

Langdon crouches in the corner and slides his hand along the back wall of the chamber. When he reaches the point at which it should intersect the side wall --

<DIRECTION>
Vittoria follows.
</DIRECTION>

They look ahead, shining the light. They're in an extremely narrow passageway.

They approach an iron doorway in the wall. The door is ajar and beyond it there is some sort of passage. Langdon squints at two words above it -- II Passetto.

HE TAKES A DEEP BREATH, SLIPS THROUGH THE GAP --

INT POPE'S OFFICE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Langdon and the others race into the pope's office and find a truly bizarre scene.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rocher is near the fireplace, brandishing his sidearm, aimed at the Camerlengo, who lays on the floor, writhing in agony.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His cassock is torn open, and his bare chest is seared black. A large, square brand is on the floor at Rocher's feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two of the Swiss Guard act without hesitation -- they open fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two bullets SLAM into Rocher's chest and he crumples.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Father Simeon bursts into the room, and as he does the Camerlengo rolls over onto one side, points his index finger at Simeon, and cries out a single word:
</DIRECTION>
<CAMERLENGO>

He rushes at the Camerlengo and Chartrand reacts on instinct, putting three bullets in Father Simeon's back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He falls to the floor, dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chartrand and the Guards dash to the Camerlengo, who clutches his chest, convulsing in pain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Langdon walks toward him, stunned, as the Guards pull the Camerlengo's hands away from his wound, revealing the fifth brand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crossed keys, seared into the flesh of his chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Langdon looks at Rocher in utter disbelief. Rocher's still alive, trying to say something, holding out a hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone else in the room is focused on the Camerlengo, so Langdon bends down, takes the dying man's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rocher looks up at him, desperation in his eyes, trying to communicate something but too weak to say more than:
</DIRECTION>
<ROCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For safety.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCHER>
<DIRECTION>
And his eyes close.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Langdon withdraws his hand from Rocher's, and finds the dying man has pressed something into his palm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A key.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Langdon looks at it, and it gives him a thought. He turns, looks at the Camerlengo, whose chest is exposed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crossed keys are indeed branded there -- but they're upside down.

Langdon slips the key in his pocket and approaches the Camerlengo as Chartrand gets to his feet, on his radio.

<DIRECTION>
The only sound that remains in the square is a soft night wind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wounded pick themselves up off the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd, realizing the blast is over, turns its attention to the body of the Camerlengo, on the far side of the square.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Langdon and Vittoria try to make their way toward him, but the crowd surges past them, and we soar over the heads of the crowd, wanting to get there first, wanting to be the first ones to see
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--- his eyes open. He's alive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDE ON THE SQUARE AS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
a great CHEER rises up from the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:

<DIRECTION>
INT SISTINE CHAPEL NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CHEERS from outside are clearly audible in the Sistine Chapel, where the doors have been thrown open and they have gotten the news. Jubilation reigns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SWISS GUARDSMAN runs in, finds Cardinal Mortati.
</DIRECTION>
<SWISS_GUARDSMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Signore Mortati, he is alive! The Camerlengo is alive!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWISS_GUARDSMAN>
<MORTATI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Praise God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORTATI>
<DIRECTION>
But he looks around him -- the Cardinals have split into small groups, they're discussing something with great animation amongst themselves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mortati watches, doesn't like what he's seeing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

INT OFFICE OF THE SWISS GUARD NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Langdon and Vittoria, on a bench in the office of the Swiss Guard, are having superficial wounds treated. The buzz in the office is intense, just as excited as in the square and the Sistine Chapel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Langdon looks over at Vittoria.
</DIRECTION>
<LANGDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANGDON>
<DIRECTION>
She looks back at him, nods. Smiles. He reaches over, interlaces his fingers with hers, and takes her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<LANGDON>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANGDON>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles, turns his hand, noticing the glass on his wristwatch is broken. He notices, seems distressed.

She smiles and kisses the back of his hand -- yes. A ROAR comes from outside and we see --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT ST. PETER'S SQUARE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- the crowd in St. Peter's Square, in rapture. There is SINGING, there's CHANTING of the Camerlengo's name. It's exactly midnight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT SISTINE CHAPEL NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the Sistine Chapel, Cardinal Mortati is in hushed, urgent conversation with a group of seven or eight Cardinals.
</DIRECTION>
<MORTATI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Signores... you are no doubt aware that by Holy Law the man is ineligible for election to the papacy. He is not a cardinal, he is a priest, a chamberlain. And there is the matter of his inadequate age. I'm sorry, the protocols of conclave are not subject to modification. I will not call a ballot on this matter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORTATI>
<DIRECTION>
The African Cardinal who cast his vote earlier speaks up.
</DIRECTION>
<AFRICAN_CARDINAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But Signore, you would not call the ballot. Surely you remember -- you gave up your post as Great Elector.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AFRICAN_CARDINAL>
<DIRECTION>
Mortati looks at him. Boxed into a corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Outside, the crowd in St. Peter's can be heard, singing joyously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SECOND CARDINAL steps forward.
</DIRECTION>
<SECOND_CARDINAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They are singing in St. Peter's Square! What happened here tonight transcends our laws!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECOND_CARDINAL>
<MORTATI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does it? Is it God's will that we abandon reason and give ourselves over to frenzy? Discard the rules of the church?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORTATI>
<DIRECTION>
A THIRD CARDINAL now, a peacemaker:
</DIRECTION>
<THIRD_CARDINAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps they need not be discarded.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THIRD_CARDINAL>
<DIRECTION>
They all look at him.
</DIRECTION>
<THIRD_CARDINAL>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am thinking now of Romano Pontifici Eligendo, Numero 63.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THIRD_CARDINAL>
<DIRECTION>
Most of the Cardinals look puzzled -- but Mortati's face darkens.
</DIRECTION>
<THIRD_CARDINAL>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Balloting is not the only method by which a Pope can be elected. There is another, more divine method.

The Second Cardinal sparks to this idea.
</DIRECTION>
<SECOND_CARDINAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(answering those around him who look confused)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Election by Adoration occurs when all the cardinals, as if by inspiration of the Holy Spirit, freely and spontaneously, unanimously and aloud, proclaim one individual's name.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECOND_CARDINAL>
<THIRD_CARDINAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the law states that Adoration supersedes all other eligibility requirements. The candidate need only be an ordained member of the clergy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(DRAMATICALLY)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	BUT!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(they listen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He must be present in the Sistine Chapel at the moment of election.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THIRD_CARDINAL>
<DIRECTION>
Many cries now of "Bring the Camerlengo to us!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mortati looks deeply troubled.

INT ROCHER'S OFFICE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bandaged now, Langdon and Vittoria are ushered into Rocher's office by a Swiss Guardsman.
</DIRECTION>
<SWISS_GUARDSMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please wait here while we arrange your transportation. May I get you anything?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWISS_GUARDSMAN>
<DIRECTION>
They shake their heads, no thanks. Settle into chairs to the side of Rocher's desk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They look uncomfortable -- it's weird to be in a dead man's office.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vittoria looks at his desk. Thinks of something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She gets up and goes to it, running her hand lightly over it.
</DIRECTION>
<LANGDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANGDON>
<VITTORIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leonardo's journals. I want them back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VITTORIA>
<DIRECTION>
She feels in the surface of the desk and finds the square outline of the inlaid panel where Rocher hid the journals. She tries prying it open, but that doesn't work, she tries pushing down on the front of it --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and the panel slowly rotates open. The journals, which were laid on top of the television monitor, slide out and onto the desk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vittoria scoops them up and is about to close the panel again when --
</DIRECTION>
<LANGDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a minute.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANGDON>
<DIRECTION>
He looks down at the monitor. Thinking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At its odd, key-shaped on/off switch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls something from his pocket -- the key Rocher gave him, just as he died.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN LANGDON'S MIND,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
he sees Rocher's face, looking up at him, dying:
</DIRECTION>
<ROCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For safety.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCHER>
<DIRECTION>
BACK IN THE OFFICE,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Langdon looks at the key, and its odd shape. Looks down at the monitor, the same odd shape where its switch should be.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN LANGDON'S MIND,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
they're back in the Pope's office, but Rocher is alive, and saying words he said earlier:
</DIRECTION>
<ROCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Holy Father was subject to seizures... but he took steps.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCHER>
<DIRECTION>
BACK IN THE OFFICE,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rocher's voice continues over, but Langdon mouths the words as he remembers them:
</DIRECTION>
<ROCHER_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"MADE SURE HE WAS WATCHED."
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCHER_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
IN LANGDON'S MIND,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rocher is back in the office again, finishing his sentence:
</DIRECTION>
<ROCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For safety.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCHER>
<DIRECTION>
IN ROCHER'S OFFICE,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Langdon holds the key up, repeating those last words:
</DIRECTION>
<LANGDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For safety.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANGDON>
<DIRECTION>
He lowers the key to the monitor, extending it toward the keyhole
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and it's a perfect fit. He twists it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And with a ZZZZT of power, the monitor winks to life. An image comes into focus.
</DIRECTION>
<VITTORIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VITTORIA>
<LANGDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That...is the papal office.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANGDON>
<DIRECTION>
On the monitor,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
they are indeed looking at an image of the Pope's office. There are two dead bodies on the floor, covered with sheets, and VATICAN POLICE are photographing everything. Must be live.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN ROCHER'S OFFICE,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Langdon's figuring it out.
</DIRECTION>
<LANGDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Pope spent a lot of time in contemplation, alone. If he was worried about seizures, he must have asked Rocher to install a camera without telling anyone. To keep an eye on him. For safety. And maybe --
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANGDON>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches down to the screen, toward a touch panel at the bottom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
You don't have to be a symbologist to understand these symbols- play, pause, fast forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And rewind. Langdon touches it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE MONITOR,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the image ZIPS backwards, rapidly, to the shooting, and the all the way back to when Rocher and the Camerlengo were alone together. Rocher stands just behind him, the Camerlengo still kneels before the fireplace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the image starts to play forward, in real time, we go in close on the monitor and come out --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT POPE'S OFFICE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- in the papal office, to watch the scene in person.
</DIRECTION>
<CAMERLENGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The scientist kept journals? So?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMERLENGO>
<ROCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You figure prominently in them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCHER>
<DIRECTION>
The Camerlengo turns his eyes back to the flames, stirring the embers with a poker.
</DIRECTION>
<CAMERLENGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMERLENGO>
<ROCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leonardo wasn't just a physicist, he was a Catholic priest. Deeply conflicted about the implications of his work and in need of spiritual guidance. About a month ago, he requested an audience with the Pope. But you'd know that, because you granted the audience, and were present during it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCHER>
<DIRECTION>
The Camerlengo twists the poker in the fire. Speaks softly.
</DIRECTION>
<CAMERLENGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The fool thought he had duplicated the moment of creation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMERLENGO>
<ROCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the Holy Father urged him to go public. His Holiness thought the discovery might actually prove the existence of a divine power -- begin to bridge the gap between religion and science.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCHER>
<CAMERLENGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Science. The new God. Ignore the weapons and chaos and madness.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMERLENGO>
<DIRECTION>
The Camerlengo looks up at him, and his expression is different than we've ever seen it. Contemptuous. Angry. Violent.
</DIRECTION>
<CAMERLENGO>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His work was not religious, it was sacrilegious!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMERLENGO>
<ROCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you saw the Pope's position as a softening of church law. An old man's weakness. Your father's weakness.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCHER>
<CAMERLENGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He raised me to protect the church. Even from within.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMERLENGO>
<ROCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you brought an old enemy back from the dead to frighten people.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCHER>
<CAMERLENGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing unites hearts like the presence of evil.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMERLENGO>
<ROCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It didn't work, Father.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCHER>
<CAMERLENGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It isn't finished.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMERLENGO>
<ROCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've informed Father Simeon of what I learned and he'll get word to the Cardinals the moment conclave opens.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCHER>
<DIRECTION>
The Camerlengo looks at him calmly for a moment --
</DIRECTION>
<CAMERLENGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was planning on doing this alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMERLENGO>
<DIRECTION>
-- and then removes the poker from the fire. But it isn't a poker, it's a long-handled brand, with a cross of some kind at the end.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rocher pulls his gun, holds it at his side.
</DIRECTION>
<ROCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put that down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCHER>
<DIRECTION>
The Camerlengo rips open his cassock with his free hand.
</DIRECTION>
<CAMERLENGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But perhaps it's better that you're here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMERLENGO>
<ROCHER>
<DIRECTION>
(raising the gun)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put it down!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCHER>
<DIRECTION>
But the Camerlengo RAMS the red-hot brand into the exposed flesh of his bare chest. His skin SIZZLES and smokes, Rocher SHOUTS, the Camerlengo SCREAMS in agony, and we know the rest --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- the door bursts open, Swiss Guard pour in, Rocher is shot, Father Simeon races toward the Camerlengo --
</DIRECTION>
<FR_SIMEON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You bastard! You sanctimonious-
	</DIALOGUE>
</FR_SIMEON>
<DIRECTION>
-- and the Camerlengo rolls over, pointing one long finger at Father Simeon and CRYING OUT:
</DIRECTION>
<CAMERLENGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	ILLUMINATUS!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMERLENGO>
<DIRECTION>
As we saw before, Lt. Chartrand FIRES THREE TIMES, killing Father Simeon in his tracks, we pull back, the image turns to --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT ROCHER'S OFFICE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- video again, and as we complete the move out from the monitor, we see it isn't Langdon and Vittoria watching the image this time --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--- but Cardinal Mortati, flanked by two other red-robed Cardinals and a half-dozen Swiss Guardsman.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Langdon and Vittoria stand to one side as Mortati turns and looks at them. Suddenly, he seems very, very old.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT GRAND STAIRCASE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Camerlengo, escorted by two Swiss Guardsman, descends the Royal Staircase that leads to the Sistine Chapel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Though he is injured and limping, he radiates confidence, even benevolence, a man certain this is the greatest day of his life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He approaches the chapel doors, speaks to the Swiss Guard posted there as he approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<CAMERLENGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have been summoned by the College of Cardinals.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMERLENGO>
<DIRECTION>
Oh, they know all about it. They lift their swords, the doors sweep open, the Camerlengo strides boldly across the threshold --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT SISTINE CHAPEL NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and stops, right there, the look of imminent ascendancy frozen on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Cardinals are looking at him, all right, but not in joy, not in wonder, not for leadership. One hundred sixty-one faces are turned toward his, with an expression of ---
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- utter condemnation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stands there for a moment, searching their faces, trying to figure out what could possibly have happened.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But it doesn't matter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They know. And he knows they know.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes two steps backwards, almost involuntarily.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Starts to teeter, balances himself in the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then straightens himself, smoothes his cassock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And turns and walks away, back up the staircase.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two Swiss Guard move to go after him, quickly, but Cardinal Mortati gestures to them.
</DIRECTION>
<MORTATI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gently. But within our walls.

INT ST. PETER'S BASILICA NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Camerlengo comes out of a doorway and into St. Peter's Basilica. He heads for the main doors --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- just as HALF A DOZEN SWISS GUARD step in from outside, blocking his way. Some MURMUR softly into their radios.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stops, turns around to come back the way he came ---
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- but TWO SWISS GUARD appear in that doorway, also with radios.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns again, no way to go but toward the front of the Basilica.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sees the candlelit balustrade near the front, the one that leads to the grottoes and the Necropolis. He picks up his pace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Swiss Guard follow, at a slight distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Camerlengo reaches the spiral staircase and stops, looking down, seeing the oil lamp he kicked over earlier.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He thinks. He picks up a fresh lamp, holds it to his face --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and blows out its flame with a soft PUFF.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ACROSS THE BASILICA,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
we're with the Swiss Guard as they walk slowly toward him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But they hear a CRY from ahead, he's gone down the stairs a short distance, and they can hear the sound of liquid SLOSHING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They break into a run as they realize what he's about to do, they're twenty feet away, then ten, then just close enough to see the Camerlengo as he --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- SMASHES a burning oil lamp at his feet. The flames leap onto his oil-soaked clothes and --

INT PAPAL APARTMENT DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside the papal apartments, Robert Langdon sits stiffly on a straight-backed chair in a hallway. Couldn't look more uncomfortable if he tried.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Swiss Guardsman stands on either side of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door to his right suddenly opens, another Guardsman nods to him, and Langdon gets to his feet, straightening his jacket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT OFFICE OF THE POPE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Langdon is shown into the office, where a robed figure is being dressed by two VATICAN ATTENDANTS -- the clothes he dons are unmistakably papal vestments. The figure, his back to us, gestures to a nearby table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the Swiss Guardsmen goes to the table and picks up an envelope, hands it to Langdon.
</DIRECTION>
<SWISS_GUARDSMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A token of thanks from His Holiness.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWISS_GUARDSMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Langdon, puzzled, opens the envelope and lets the contents fall into his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a thin volume, but a familiar one -- the only surviving copy of Galileo's Diagramma. Langdon nearly GASPS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The figure in the papal robes turn around. It is, of course, Cardinal Mortati.
</DIRECTION>
<MORTATI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This should help you complete your scholarly work, Professor.

<MORTATI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The world is in need of both. Science can heal, or science can kill. It depends on the soul of the man using the science.

<DIRECTION>
Langdon looks at him. Likes the sound of that.
</DIRECTION>
<LANGDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll lead wisely.

</LANGDON>
<MORTATI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm an old man. I'll lead briefly,

Mortati comes closer to Langdon, raises his right hand, and makes a gentle sign of the cross over him, murmuring softly.

<MORTATI>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks be to God, for sending someone to protect His church.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORTATI>
<LANGDON>
	<DIALOGUE>

He turns, and his Aides part the billowing silk curtains that lead to the papal balcony.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We move forward with him as he steps out over St. Peter's Square and a great ROAR rises up from below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cardinal Mortati, Pope Luke I, holds his arms out to his sides, an embrace to take in the world --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and behind him, hidden in the shadows of the papal apartment, just behind the billowing curtains, Robert Langdon folds his hand in front of him --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and bows his head.
