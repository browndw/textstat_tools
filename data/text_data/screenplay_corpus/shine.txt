INT. OLD HALL - DAY As if in a dream, children's faces turn to look at camera in soundless slow-motion. Some are made up, prissy, perfectly dressed for a performance, accompanies by 'stage mothers', fanning themselves in the stifling heat, all eyes focused on the next contestant as he makes his way up the centre aisle.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's hear it for our next young contestant, David Helfgott.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNOUNCER>
<DIRECTION>
David, nine, makes his way down the aisle clutching a score. His hair is meticulously parted and he wears spectacles. A little uncertain, he stops and looks back to his father. Peter HELFGOTT is a thickset Polish man in his fifties. He motions for David to keep going, then sits, anxious and excited. David walks up some steps onto the stage.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Chopin! The Polonaise!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<DIRECTION>
Peter smiles full of charm, and a little embarrassed at all eyes on him; he applauds encouragingly then sits. David's hells click on the bare boards as he crosses to the old upright piano centre-stage. HE adjusts his music. His bony legs barely reac the pedals. HE difgets, looks into the spotlight. He takes a deep breath, then launches into Chopin's Polonaise in A Flat, the first few bars ring out with unusual power, surprising everyone - BEN Rosen in particular.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David attacks the keys with such gusto that the piano inches forward. HE hooks his foot around the leg of the stool and drit in. He plays on. The piano moves again. He blurs some notes. Again he readjusts the stool without missing a beat; pages of his score flutter to the ground but David plays on, undaunted, to the end. Rosen watches the courageous performance with wry amazement. Peter arrives backstage flustered. To the ANNOUNCER :

Moments later Peter takes a score from a battered suitcase full of music: Rachmaninov's Third Piano Concerto. IT's awesome in its complexity, page after page.

EXT. STREET - DAY A rickety pram wheel wobbles along. Widen to reveal Peter pushing the dilapidated old pram down the ordinary suburban street, flanked by David and SUZIE wearing grubby school uniforms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Several kids playing hopscotch stop as they see them approaching, then clear a path for the odd trio to pass. SUZIE looks down her nose at them. David performs the hopscotch without missing a beat as the trio continues on its way. The kids watch after them, like they were from another planet.

INT. SYNAGOGUE. OFFICE CORRIDOR - DAY An elderly receptionist types with one finger on an antiquated typewriter. Peter sits in the narrow corridor, arms folded tightly. He would rather be somewhere else. On the wall opposite him a long line of faces - the portraits of past rabbis of the synagogue stare down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Peter glances at the folded newspaper on the seat next to him: The Maccabean. On the front page - a photo of David seated at the piano with a smiling Peter, pointing at a score as if taking David through a lesson.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The elderly typist removes the sheet from the typewriter and smiles at Peter. He nods politely, then resumes his steely composure. The door to the RABBI's office opens. Peter stands.

MRS. BOKSER Mr. Helfott, it's exciting isn't it? David, the Lord Mayor's dying to meet you.

EXT. HELFGOTT HOUSE - DAY David hurries out the front door excitedy at the sound of the POSTMAN's whistle. The POSTMAN finds a letter for David in his satchel and holds it away before playfully dropping it into the letter box. David grabs it and registers where it's come from.

EXT. BEN Rosen'S HOUSE - NIGHT The house is in darkness. David knocks. He's been running, in a sweat.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Rosen?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
No answer.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Rosen. It's David.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(He bangs at the door.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please Mr. Rosen. Please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
There's nobody home. David slides down the door, clutching his knees, bewildered.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cut to water rippling in the moonlight. David's reflection appears in the pond. He watches the distortion of his face in the water, then slaps the surface and after a moment the image settles again. He puts his head under, right up to his shoulders.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cut to underwater, David's face, as bubbles escape from his mouth. In fact we are :
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HELFOTT BATHROOM - NIGHT We realize David's face is underwater in the bath. He surfaces, for air... and just stares, breathing awkwardly. Peter enters in a dressing gown.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on David, you have been long enough. Are you feeling better now? Silly boy, all this nonsense. This is your home, this is where you belong...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<DIRECTION>
David's POV: Peter peeling off his dressing gown singlet, talking but there is no sound - it's like a dream. Peter goes to get in but stops as he sees something in the bath that horrifies him.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	David!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(He slaps David's head.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You animal. You disgusting animal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<DIRECTION>
He slashes at David with a white singlet, splashing water everywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To shit in the bath. To do this to me. You callous boy. To shit like an animal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<DIRECTION>
David barely reacts as the attack with the wet singlet continues, across his bare back, his head... water arcs across the small bathroom with each blow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just as suddenly as it started, it's over. Peter is gone. Water runs down the walls like blood. A drop forms on the flickering light globe, then falls. David just stares... in shock. Silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SYNAGOGUE - DAY RACHEL is huddled with SUZIE, Margaret and LOUISE in the upper balcony. The Jewish community watches as David sings from the Torah, taking his bar mitzvah, head bowed, almost cowering.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rosen senses something is wrong. He looks across at Peter whose stern unwavering expression gives nothing away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Close-up: Peter, a man of steel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HELFGOTT HOUSE - NIGHT Wide shot. The house is in near darkness. Rosen walks up purposefully and scrapes the front gate open. He knocks at the door. No answer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HELFGOTT HOUSE - NIGHT In the hallway - Rosen's silhouette through the opawue glass. He knocks again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reveal Peter, in the shadowy darkness, the outside world completely shut out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE LOUNGEROOM - NIGHT The air is thick with tension. RACHEL amuses little LOUISE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUZIE flips through the scrapbook. Margaret fingers the same note on the piano. All stop as the knocking echoes again through the solemn quiet, like a knell. Silence.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This house is like a concentration camp.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET>
<DIRECTION>
She lets the piano lid drop shut. In the hallway Rosen's shadow waits at the door.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSEN>

Rosen give up, turns to go, but then as an afterthought:
</DIRECTION>
<ROSEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever you do, don't inflict bloddy Rachmaninov on him. He's not ready!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSEN>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HELFGOTT HOUSE - NIGHT In the hallway - Rosen's shadow disappears. The gate is heard scraping open as he leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Peter just stands there. The sound ofRosen's car is heard driving away, the headlights flicker across Peter's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HELFGOTT HOUSE - NIGHT Peter stands over the bed where David lies, facing away.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>

</PETER>
<DIRECTION>
Pause.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a terrible thing to hate, to hate your fatehr.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. He sits on the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Life is cruel, but music, it will always be your friend. Everything else will let you down in the end. Everything. Believe me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Pause.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please don't hate me David.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<DIRECTION>
He begins to cry. He sobs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David looks at his father crying, full of confusion. Their eyes meet and Peter pulls David up and hugs him. David throws his arms around his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(in Yiddish)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't hate me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<DIRECTION>
Peter kisses David repeatedly on the side of the face, all the while stuttering:
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's tough, life can be tough but you have to survive, say it. You have to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Survive, Daddy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right, David. No one will love you like me. You can't trust anyone but I will always be there - always be with you, forever. Do you understand?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Daddy, forever.
	</DIALOGUE>

Peter AND David Forever and ever.

INT. David'S ROOM. EDEN LODGE - NIGHT ADULT David sits on the floor in the middle of the room, scrounging for a match amidst the mess of paper and music spread around him. He picks up something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a crumpled old letter with distinctive letterhead: Royal College of Music. David peers myopically at it - we only glimpse a few words: 'Dear Mr. Helfgott, we are pleased to inform you.'
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fade up - music, from the past - 'Sospiro' by Liszt. It continues over:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRAIN TUNNEL. DAY. THE PAST. The train exits a tunnel into bright strobing light. EXT. OVERGROWN DRIVEWAY OF KATHERINE'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON Bright light pours through a jungle of trees and exotic plants. David makes his way down the long overgrown drive. Finally, a small weatherboard cottage comes into view, its verandah wreathed in wisteria, jasmine and honeysuckle.

INT. KATHERINE'S HOUSE - NIGHT David plays the final bars of the Appassionata. When he finishes, he looks to KATHERINE in front of several photos on the mantel, lost in the past, moved by his palying.

</KATHERINE_s_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The camera moves towards the piano, where David is stooped over. We just see the top of his head until he lokos up and, we realize, years have passed. David is now a young adult. He scribbles the words of the poem onto a score, awed by their beauty as she continues to read.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
INT. CONCERT HALL - NIGHT Stagehands carefully position the grand piano onstage. Lights and curtains are being set for a performance. Cut to backstage, hands soak in a steaming bowl of water, next to it is a score of Rachmaninov's Third. David warms his hands in the water, the poise and confidence of his younger years gone, replaced by a shambling insecurity. He throws a nervous look around at the other contestants:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CELLIST warms up, a VIOLINIST paces, a CONTESTANT goes over her score while another pianist, ROGER, 25, warms up on an old upright piano in the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cut to the foyer. The audience assembles, waiting to go in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A poster tells us the occasion is the 'ABC - NATIONAL CONCERTO COMPETITION'.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Arriving amidst the furs and jewellery, Peter is just another face in the crowd. Something draws his attention: BEN Rosen on the stair. He catches Peter looking. Neither hids their contempt. Rosen comments to his companion:

<ROSEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Poor man's Leopold Mozart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSEN>

She puts the book aside.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was forever busy in his study. 'Go away, Kattie, I'm writing,' he'd always say. One day, I was very young, I got so annoyed I emptied the inkpots all over his desk and I scrawled on his work, pages of it. When he saw it he stood there seething with anger; I could feel it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
David fills with dread.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'What are you doing?' he shouted.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
It startles David, feeding his own fears.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There was this terrible silence. I just stared at him and said, 'Go away, daddy, I'm writing.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
David is suspended.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>

INT. RCOM CORRIDOR. DAY - The present David shuffles along, past the practice rooms from where different instruments sound, merging into one another as David continues on his hourney, his face full of childish wonder.
