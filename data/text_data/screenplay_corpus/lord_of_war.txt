<DIRECTION>
FADE UP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP on the face of YURI ORLOV.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Late-thirties, maybe the wrong side of forty, cigarette dangling from his fingers, wearing a conservative suit and tie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Black smoke wafts in front of his face. He speaks matter-of-factly, directly into camera.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are over 550 million firearms in worldwide circulation. That's one firearm for every twelve people on the planet. The only question is...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(taking a draft and stubbing out the cigarette)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...how do we arm the other eleven?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
The camera zooms away from his face, revealing:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yuri alone on a battlefield surrounded by the charred carcasses of armored military vehicles and other equipment, discarded weapons and ammunition, desert floor stained with what appears to be blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The faint sound of gunfire, some distance away, carries to us on the wind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A TITLE SEQUENCE FOLLOWS - A CONTINUOUS SHOT FROM A CAMERA MOUNTED ON THE BACK OF A BULLET CASING - ILLUSTRATING THE LIFESPAN OF THE BULLET.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- Gunpowder is poured into a metal casing, lead slug mounted on top. A BULLET is born. A perfect 39mm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- The BULLET travels along a conveyor belt with thousands of identical siblings in a Ukrainian factory so grey it's monochrome.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- The BULLET, picked up by a ham-fisted UKRAINIAN FACTORY WORKER, is tossed into a crate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- The BULLET, lying in its open crate, rolls down a chute where it's inspected by a UKRAINIAN MILITARY OFFICER holding a manifest. He seems to stare directly at our BULLET.
</DIRECTION>
<UKRAINIAN_OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
(to his SUBORDINATE carrying a manifest, in Ukrainian)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Call it "agricultural machinery".
	</DIALOGUE>
</UKRAINIAN_OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
- The BULLET's crate rattles around in an open-bed truck along an industrial road, passes a decapitated statue of LENIN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- The crate containing our BULLET is placed on a ship in the cold grey Odessa harbor. A container door closes, plunging the bullet into darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- The door re-opens. The BULLET, still in its crate, now basks in bright, tropical sunshine, surrounded by an azure sea.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- The crate is removed by a pair of slim, dark hands, revealing a glimpse of the bustling, weathered port of Abidjan in the Ivory Coast. The crate is one of dozens unloaded from the ship.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- BULLET's POV from another open-air truck, now slogging through a mud-clogged road in lush rainforest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- The BULLET is unloaded from the truck in Freetown, Sierra Leone - immediately grabbed by the young HAND of a RUF soldier.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- The BULLET is loaded into a 30-round magazine which is inserted into an AK-47 machine gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- The BULLET waits - in the gloomy chamber. Suddenly, from outside, the sound of raised voices and gunfire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- The BULLET and its neighbors start to rise quickly up the magazine towards the chamber as the Kalashnikov is fired.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- Our hero BULLET is next. Will it see action?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- Smack. The gun's bolt strieks the explosive cap, gunpowder ignited, the BULLET driven out of the barrel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- Shed of its casing - now only a slug - the BULLET emerges into bright sunshine. It is flying down the main street in Freetown.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- The BULLET gives us a perfect point-of-view of the bullet ahead of it. They are both flying towards their intended target - a wild- eyed CHILD SOLDIER, a boy no more than twelve, firing an AK-47 almost as tall as he is.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- The leading bullet narrowly misses, whistles past the boy's ear, striking the whitewashed wall behind - one more pock-mark in a building riddled with pock-marks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- Our BULLET, following close behind, finds its mark, slamming into the boy's forehead just above his left eye - his expression, oddly relieved.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- The BULLET carves through the lobes of the boy's brain where it is enveloped in blood, finally plunged into darkness - the bullet's final resting place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

	I was born Yuri Orlovitch in the city of Odessa in a country that no longer exists. You might have heard of it - a little place called the Soviet Union.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
A YOUNG COMMUNIST sits in the shadow of a statue of Trotsky in the Soviet-style plaza, jacket and neckerchief removed in the summer heat, poring over a Communist text. Yuri approaches, pretends to be interested in the statue, glances to the Young Communist's book.

Now wearing the pin in his own jacket along with the neckerchief and a stern expression, YURI strides to the front of the line in the store.

The female STORE CLERK is about to order Yuri to the back of the line when Yuri flashes the pin.

Intimidated, the Clerk smiles and pulls a special tray from under the counter. In contrast to the meager offerings on the shelves, the tray contains bags of sugar, coffee, bananas, even Pepsi.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
While a parade of weapons in Red Square plays silently on the state- controlled TV, father ANATOLY and Military Cadet older brother VITALY, shoulder bandaged, sit at a tiny table, drinking cheap vodka and listening intently to an illegal shortwave radio - coat hanger for antenna.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My father was a wounded hero of World War Two, my younger brother was wounded in Afghanistan - a war without heroes. I'd gotten out of military service due to a heart problem - it wasn't completely a lie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
YURI joins them, careful not to interrupt the broadcoast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He goes to pour himself a glass of vodka. Without looking away from the radio, his father's hand grasps Yuri's in a vice-like grip, preventing him from lifting the bottle.

INT. UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT OFFICE. DAY.

ANATOLY, with YURI at his side, presents the rubbing along with other crudely forged paperwork confirming their Jewish ancestry to a CLERK. "ORLOVITCH" now "ORLOV".

	The rubbing from the Jewish headstone was my first forged document. Little about my life has been kosher ever since.

INT. APARTMENT, BEDROOM. NIGHT.

<DIRECTION>
Suitcase in hand, YURI surveys his bedroom for the last time.
</DIRECTION>

A car horn. He glances through the window to the communist-style plaza below. ANATOLY beckons impatiently to Yuri. VITALY and IRINA load overstuffed suitcases into an old Russian sedan driven by an old Russian Military Officer, UNCLE DMITRI.

Yuri stares at himself in the mirror. He replaces his stolen Soviet pin for a necklace - a Star of David.

Baptiste washes his hands, stares at Yuri in the mirror, smiles.

From behind a jerry-rigged curtain appears the vision that is AVA CORDOVA. She wears a dress that appears to have been sewn onto her. She is obscenely beautiful in the squalid setting.

YURI and two other U.N. PEACEKEEPERS get loaded on local beer with local PROSTITUTES - one of the peacekeepers pouring beer down a prostitute's throat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the shadows across the street, a LIBERIAN MAN observes the group.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yuri's colleagues toss some Liberian dollars at a waiter and stagger drunkenly away from the bar, leaning for support on the PROSTITUTES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
YURI remains at the verandah, exchanges a smile with a YOUNG PROSTITUTE, at least two years from legal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's tempted. He knocks back his drink. He approaches the girl - presses a few bills into her hand. She picks up her purse, makes to leave with him but he motions her to stay.

Yuri exits alone. The Liberian Man, across the street, follows.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. DOWNTOWN MONROVIA - STREET. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
YURI walks down a poorly-lit sidestreet. He feels something in his back - stops abruptly. His hand reflexively goes to his holster. Empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns. The young LIBERIAN MAN is holding him up with his own gun.

</DIRECTION>
<YURI>

INT. CAPTAIN CARLISLE'S PRIVATE QUARTERS. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>

CLOSE ON two blue helmets lying beside each other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
YURI and CAPTAIN VIVIAN CARLISLE are under the mosquito netting of a bed in her private quarters - trying to get each other out of their respective clothes as fast as possible - mouths and hands everywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Even in the heat of the moment, VIVIAN is unable to completely let go of her work.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>

Satisfied with the answer, she completely gives in to the throes of passion - pulls him to her.

EXT. EMBASSY COMPOUND. NIGHT.

<DIRECTION>
A white armored personnel carrier sits unattended.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The LIBERIAN MAN and two COLLEAGUES approach the carrier's door. It opens with their newly-made key.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The men start to unload the weapons inside the carrier, spilling a box of ammunition in their haste.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The camera drifts off the carrier to reveal YURI, behind the barracks, counting a thick wad of U.S. dollars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spying a lone BULLET on the ground, Yuri picks it up. We sense he has made a decision from which there is no return.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. INT. "THE CRIMEAN" RESTAURANT - BRIGHTON BEACH. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The BULLET has been turned into a pendant, replacing Yuri's Star of David.

Yuri flashes his killer smile in response.

<DIRECTION>
Out of their sight, he slips a hundred dollar bill into the cash register and breezes into the kitchen.

<DIRECTION>
INT. "THE CRIMEAN" RESTAURANT - KITCHEN. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VITALY, now chef in the family business, prepares a Russian borscht in a kitchen unlikely to pass a health inspection.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
YURI tastes the food, pretends to gag, spits it out in the sink. Vitaly affectionately cuffs his older brother - the joke obviously a familiar ritual.
</DIRECTION>

Yuri takes his brother to the kitchen's rear door.

At the back of the restaurant, YURI and VITALY sit on the steps amongst the garbage cans.

Yuri drags Vitaly away from the sales girls.

Yuri and Vitaly drop to the ground, money flying.

The machine gun fire subsides, a shower of dust, fragments of brick and hundred dollar bills still floating to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vitaly, first to recover, draws his own handgun, sneaks a look through a shell hole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the other side of the wall, a firing squad of MILITIAMEN has executed one group of MEN, lying contorted, slumped against the wall. Their bound hands and feet give the bodies a macabre awkwardness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yuri is scrabbling in the dust for the cash.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Militiamen prepare to execute another six men. Men? We focus on one HANDSOME YOUNG LEBANESE BOY, barely in his teens.

Vitaly, gun poised, goes to intervene. A HAND, stuffed with cash, stops him. Yuri.

Up the street, a celebration is taking place - a band, balloons, confetti, dancing.

Finally, a Congolese man, JOHN "CANNIBAL" NGAWE, appears at the warehouse.

The conversation is in French.

(looking to his unopened crates, more and more agitated)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Friends?! You can't be fucking friends. Last week I spoke to you on the phone. You said you would not rest until every last rebel was dead. You called them vermin. You said would piss in their mouths, you said you would exterminate them like cockroaches. Just last week, you said this!

EXT. NORTHERN AFGHANISTAN. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
YURI and VITALY stand at a checkpoint in the rugged mountains. Guns and ammunition are strapped to donkeys tended by MUJAHIDEEN FIGHTERS. An AFGHANI OFFICIAL inspects the cargo.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I even shipped cargo to Afghanistan when they were still fighting fellow Russians. But I never sold to Osama bin Laden. Not for any moral grounds. Back then he was always bouncing checks.

Vitaly hands the Official his documentation - clipped to it, a thick wad of bills.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Afghani Official smiles. He returns to his mud-brick border station beside the confiscated merchandise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yuri focuses on a swimsuit calendar hanging on the mud wall - Miss May is AVA CORDOVA.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And everywhere I went, Ava Cordova kept following me around. We were as international as each other.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FREIGHTER SHIP. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We tilt up from the water to find YURI on the deck of a freighter, ploughing the ballpoint blue seas off the coast of Colombia.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
North of Barranquilla, Colombia - 1989.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>

VITALY holds onto a railing trying to stave off seasickness, not helped by standing downwind from Yuri's cigarette smoke.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
<DIRECTION>

Yuri makes a call on his cell phone.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To keep authorities in the dark, I often spoke in code. Rocket launchers were "mothers", the rockets "children". Assault rifles were "apples". The AK-47 was "the Angel King".

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Angel King will arrive tomorrow...Hallelujah to you too.

Yuri hangs up. His phone rings with an incoming call.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes?...Slow the fuck down--what do you mean, tipped off? They know where we are?! Where are they?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
Yuri grabs a pair of binoculars. On the horizon, a fast-approaching speed boat - INTERPOL AGENTS visible on the racer's deck.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

The CREWMAN hastily complies. Yuri's call is answered.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now!

The terrified PAINTER makes for the stern where he's hurriedly winched over.

Yuri returns to the phone call.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, it's got to check out...you got a shorter name!...what?--Kono? How do you spell that?...K-O-N-O. That's good!

He hangs up.

<YURI>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kono! K-O-N-O.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
The PAINTER, nods nervously from his precarious perch, starts to paint.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yuri sneaks another look through his binoculars. The Customs Boat is closing fast.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd) (back into phone)

	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>

<YURI>

	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
Vitaly turns the flag sideways - now a makeshift Dutch flag. Vitaly nods, impressed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yuri looks forward. The Customs Boat has almost reached the bow of the freighter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The flag is hoisted. The Painter, barely completing the last "O" of "KONO", is hauled back on deck.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's it! Everybody look innocent--now!
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
The CREW resume their normal duties as the Customs Boat slows to a crawl itself, at close quarters with the freighter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The heavily-armed INTERPOL AGENTS eyeball the rusted vessel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
YURI focuses on the senior agent - JACK VALENTINE. While the other agents wear sunglasses, long hair, tattoo or personalized uniform, Valentine is completely by the book. His Interpol windbreaker clean and zipped to the neck.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They say every man has his price - but not every man gets it. Interpol Agent, Jack Valentine, couldn't be bought, at least not with money. For Jack, glory was the prize.

</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
The Customs Boat ominously circles the freighter like a hungry shark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. INTERPOL BOAT. DAY.

<DIRECTION>
VALENTINE never averts his eyes from the ship.
</DIRECTION>
<VALENTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not exactly "The Love Boat".

Another AGENT hands him a phone.

</VALENTINE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FREIGHTER / INTERPOL BOAT. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the railing, YURI watches the Interpol boat draw alongside the freighter. He surreptitiously makes another phone call.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
<DIRECTION>
(anxious whisper into phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's Yuri. Phone in a sighting of the Kristol south of Aruba.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
The boat is secured to the ladder that runs down the side of the freighter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VALENTINE checks his sidearm, climbs the ladder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DECK - FREIGHTER. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yuri spies a life ring emblazoned with the word "KRISTOL". He flips it around as Valentine and the other agents board.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Valentine strides past Yuri to a container, nods to an agent to open it. The large metal door opens to reveal a large container full of grain - grain spilling onto the deck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Valentine is about to plunge his hand into the grain when a mobile phone rings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CREWMAN calls to Valentine from the bridge of the Interpol boat.
</DIRECTION>
<AGENT>
<DIRECTION>
(referring to the phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, sighting of the Kristol due north.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGENT>
<DIRECTION>
Valentine hesitates, returns to the ladder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the agents go, they fail to see the pile of grain shift in the container exposing a crate of assault rifles hidden there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RAILING - FREIGHTER. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yuri and Vitaly watch the Interpol boat leap away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the FREIGHTER, we focus on the terrified PAINTER standing beside Yuri - a pool of urine appears from the trouser leg.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yuri pretends not to notice, slaps the Painter on the back.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON the word, "KONO". From the "O", a paint drop runs down the stern.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BARRANQUILLA HARBOR, COLOMBIA. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
YURI and VITALY supervise the unloading of the freighter from the dockside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are alerted by the sound of a battle raging somewhere on the outskirts of the docks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Jeep, full to overflowing with heavily-armed NARCO-GUERRILLAS suddenly appears at the far end of the dock and speeds towards them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A military vehicle full of COLOMBIAN SOLDIERS chases the Guerrillas several hundred yards behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Jeep full of Guerrillas screeches to a stop by the freighter. The NARC LEADER grabs a box of unloaded ammunition.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you don't fuck him--
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
The Narc Leader turns and shoots Yuri in the side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yuri shudders with the impact. The enraged Vitaly lunges towards the Leader but Yuri, despite his wound, holds him back.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>

	<DIALOGUE>

</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
Vitaly nurses Yuri to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The GUERRILLAS ignore them, frantically re-load just in time, immediately start shooting at the approaching government vehicle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The government vehicle throws a vicious 180, almost toppling over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Guerillas, now back in business, take off after the government troops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yuri lies on the dock, genuinely surprised by the sight of his own blood.

YURI, now heavily bandaged around the waist, and VITALY keep a watchful eye as the NARC LEADER inspects crates of machine guns and other ammunition.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The second rule is always ensure you have a foolproof way to get paid. Credit card, check, cash. Preferably in advance, ideally to an off-shore account. It's why I choose my customers so carefully. Say what you like about warlords and dictators, they tend to have a highly developed sense of order. They always pay their bills on time.

The Narc Leader nods his approval.

The Narc Leader ignores him, climbs in his Jeep and drives off. The truck, loaded with munitions, also exits.

Yuri and Vitaly are left alone in their warehouse.

(staring at their "remuneration")
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VITALY>
<DIRECTION>
Yuri shrugs, slices open one of the packs of cocaine. He takes a bill from his pocket, rolls it into a tube.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He goes to hand Vitaly the tube but his brother has already rolled his own.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vitaly dips his tube into the coke - snorts, keeps snorting - a longer inhale than should be possible for a human being.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL ROOM - BARRANQUILLA, COLOMBIA. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Six kilo-sized coffee cans. YURI, still bandaged, is pouring the coffee down the toilet and replacing it with the bags of cocaine, mumbling Ukrainian profanities as he works.

	<DIALOGUE>
	The end of the Cold War was the beginning of the hottest time in arms dealing. The Wall had fallen. The arms bazaar was open. Those forty-five years had generated the highest weapons build-up in history. The Soviets had tanks and guns coming out the demon hole - huge stockpiles and now no enemy.

	10,000 Kalashnikovs for a battalion. Your stocks are dangerously depleted, Dmitri. You should order more from the factory.

</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
This is too much for Dmitri. He stops, confronts Yuri - takes back the AK-47 Yuri is inspecting.

<DMITRI>

	Someone will work this out, Yuri. What happens then?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DMITRI>
<YURI>

EXT. ODESSA MILITARY BASE. DUSK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sun sets over a grassy field. YURI sits alone - closely inspects a Kalashnikov.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a strange moment between a man and his favorite gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As we hear Yuri's thoughts, we are treated to lovingly shot close ups of the weapon and its features often seen in slow motion: Sun glistening off the chromed barrel. Folding metal stock arcing elegantly into place. Precise docking of the 30-round curved magazine.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Avtomat Kalashnikova, model of 1947 - more commonly known as the AK-47 or Kalashnikov. It's the world's most popular assault ritle - a weapon all fighters love. An elegantly simple nine pound amalgamation of forged steel and molded plastic. It doesn't break, jam or over-heat. It will shoot whether its covered in mud or filled with sand. It's so easy, even a child can use it. And they do. The Russians put the gun on a coin. Mozambique put it on their flag. Since the end of the Cold War, the Kalashnikov has become the Russian peoples' greatest export - after that comes vodka and suicidal novelists. One thing's for sure, no one was lining up to buy their cars.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
We reveal where Yuri is sitting - on the roof of a rusting Russian sedan, the Vaz 4-door. A goat is eating the upholstery.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yuri checks on the crates of AK-47's being loaded into a convoy of trucks. In the background, the armory, full a week ago, is now virtually empty. Yuri smiles a satisfied smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His reverie is interrupted by the sound of a car horn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A commotion at the gate. Another large, black Mercedes is parked there, DRIVER leaning on the horn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
YURI smiles as he sees the passenger emerge from the car - SIMEON ZAHAROFF.
</DIRECTION>

	Of course my idea was not entirely unique. I had rivals.

Simeon angrily confronts the SOLDIER at the gate.

DMITRI puts on his cap, about to investigate. YURI stops him.

Dmitri shrugs and complies. Yuri strides towards the gate.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What papers?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
The Officer turns on his heel and returns to his guard station with the passport, starts watching TV. The Bodyguards make to follow but the Soldiers close ranks, barring their path.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Simeon fumes.

<YURI>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're late, Simeon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
YURI breezes past the Soldiers with an easy familiarity. He enters the guard station as if he owns it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From beside his car, Simeon watches as Yuri jovially discusses the situation with the Young Officer. After a moment Yuri slips the Officer money in exchange for Simeon's passport.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yuri emerges from the station and returns the passport to the veteran gunrunner.

</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
The Barmaid giggles and exits.
</DIRECTION>

Simeon is clearly disquieted by the change in the balance of power or maybe it's the bad early-nineties pop music. His BODYGUARDS sit at the table behind.

<DIRECTION>
Simeon shrugs.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMEON>

	I can't deny, it takes some getting used to. Last week we were trying to beat their brains in and now we're going into business together.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMEON>

	There's no place in gunrunning for politics anymore, Simeon. I sell to leftists, rightists. I'd sell to pacifists but they're not the most regular of customers.

Simeon regards the young man with a mixture of fear and admiration pours himself another drink.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMEON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I understand you have Ukraine in your pocket but there are the other satellite states. Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Belarus. Instead of cutting each other's throats, it may be more profitable to work together. What do you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMEON>
<DIRECTION>
Yuri smiles - the proposal is the victory he has been seeking.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you are the amateur now. I think you suffer from a philosophical disadvantage - you have a philosophy. I think you should go with your instincts - your first instinct.

	My best customer was self-declared president of Liberia, Andre Baptiste. Even though we'd met before, I was in no hurry to meet him again. He'd gotten a reputation for routinely hacking off the limbs of those who opposed him. His seven-year civil war has been described as "a relentless campaign of sadistic, wanton violence unimaginable to those unfamiliar with the details of man's capacity to visit the abyss." That kind of sums up Andy for me.

</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
As the final truck door is secured, a customized Lincoln Continental convertible comes flying around a corner - stereo blaring, deliberately terrorizing the locals on the dock.
</DIRECTION>

The car slides to a stop beside Yuri. It contains ANDRE BAPTISTE JNR., a handsome young man with sunglasses, a mirror for an earring and a facial tattoo. Also in the car, two BODYGUARDS and a pair of LIBERIAN TEENAGE GIRLS dressed in Dallas Cowboy cheerleader uniforms.

(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But if I thought I was scared of Andre Senior, I knew I was scared of Andre Junior. Like father, like son. The guava doesn't fall too far from the tree. He was a heavy- drinker, a womanizer with a penchant for cheerleaders and a lover of fast American automobiles which he drove recklessly and with total impunity around the streets of the capital. Oh yes, he was also a cannibal. They say Andre would eat a victim's heart while it was still beating to give him superhuman strength. I could've told him he'd get the same effect from a pastrami sandwich at Carnegie's Deli.

	Monrovia itself was like being on another planet. Planet Monrovia. From the temperature it was obviously a planet close to the sun.

A Glock .45, Heckler & Koch .40 and a Beretta 9mm sitm on the ostentatious mahogany desk in front of President of Liberia, ANDRE BAPTISTE - a few pounds heavier, still wearing the same size uniform. ANDRE JNR. watches over his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andre Baptiste examines each handgun methodically.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In front of him, a pensive YURI, taking in his surroundings. Half a dozen gun-toting ELITE GUARDS keep an idle watch. Several HOSTESSES tend to a refreshments table. On a nearby sofa, a LIEUTENANT flirts with one of the hostesses.

The other Officers laugh uncertainly.

The Lieutenant's body is dragged out - leaving a smear of blood across the marble floor.

Baptiste, seemingly oblivious to the carnage he's wreaked, resumes talking to Yuri, in a measured way as if he's discussing the sad state of punctuality in contemporary society.

ANDRE BAPTISTE haggles with YURI as he inspects his troops ranging from twelve to fourteen. Yuri, averts his eyes from the boys, uncomfortable reviewing soldiers a head shorter than he.

OLDER SOLDIERS fill the ranks behind.
</DIRECTION>
<BAPTISTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't pay your asking price, Yuri. We are not a rich people and the market is already flooded with your Kalashnikovs. In some places you can buy one for the price of a chicken.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAPTISTE>
<YURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't just look at the unit price. You forget the ancillary costs. End user certificates need to be forged and notarized, shell companies set up, insurance purchased, pilots and crews hired. Not to mention the bribes. You can't get a nut and bolt out of the Eastern bloc without a bribe. There's one bribe for the nut. Another for the bolt. This is an expensive proposition.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I figured I was a patron of the arts and of everything else Ava had tried and failed at after modelling. Acting, her own cosmetics line. I didn't sabotage her careers but I can't deny it was convenient for me in maintaining a low profile. She was a beautiful bird in a gilded cage.

YURI rides in the back seat of the sedan, scouring the world affairs sections of several newspapers.

AVA, dressed in a robe, all smiles, pours herself a cup of coffee. She sips the coffee at the window, glances down.

In the courtyard below, INTERPOL AGENTS are picking through the garbage cans under the supervision of AGENT VALENTINE. Valentine curiously examines the toy gun.

The cargo hold of an Ilyushin-76 cargo plane. It's so overflowing with weapons, many are strapped into the passenger seats.

<DIRECTION>
Sierra Leone - 1999.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was now the best merchant of death alive. I didn't own my own plane. I owned a fleet - running guns into Liberia, Sierra Leone or the Ivory Coast at least once a week. Unfortunately, my friends at Interpol were also starting to find West Africa on the map. Most trips I had phoney paperwork. If the deadline was tight, I had no paperwork at all.
	</DIALOGUE>

In the cockpit, an American PILOT and CO-PILOT keep an idle watch on their instruments as they fly over the endless plains of Sierra Leone. YURI sits in the jump-seat, reading the Wall Street Journal.

EXT. HIGHWAY. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A heavily-trafficked highway. WOMEN carrying water jars on their heads, a thin COW pulling the carcass of a car, VENDORS selling dry meat, CHILDREN playing war games.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pedestrians look up to see the lumbering Ilyushin making its final approach - they scatter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Ilyushin weaves on landing, hits a bone-jarring pothole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE PLANE - boxes of grenades, bullets and other munitions jump dangerously up and down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, the Ilyushin pulls up safely on the highway, engines shutting down. YURI's head appears out of the cockpit window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Curious LOCALS, recovered from the shock, are gathering at the side of the road.

(to the gathering locals)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help yourselves. Be my guest. No charge.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
One LOCAL MAN tentatively approaches the cargo bay. Yuri hands him an AK-47 and a box of shells.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
More SIERRA LEONESE LOCALS emerge from the side of the road, seemingly out of thin air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yuri hands out more guns.

<YURI>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd) (to other locals)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take the whole crate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
Two men oblige, ferrying the crate away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The other locals become bolder, then brazen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Soon it's a free-far-all. Men, women and children swarm all over the plane pilfering the arms and anything else that isn't bolted down - also a lot that is.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yuri has to exit the plane to avoid being trampled in the rush.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HIGHWAY. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
YURI buys a Fanta from a vendor - exchanging it for a box of grenades.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sits on a soda crate for a front row seat at the chaos.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yuri has a calculator out - totalling his losses.

<YURI>

</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
Glancing up the highway, Yuri sees an approaching cloud of dust - VALENTINE and two truckfuls of heavily-armed Interpol Agents.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Too late. The last of the guns and ammunition are being carted away on the back of a thin cow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Valentine's truck fishtails to a halt beside the stripped plane.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Valentine is first off the trucks and into the plane's cargo bay - empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Other INTERPOL AGENTS fan out - futilely questioning locals.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miraculously the weapons have vanished into the bush.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Valentine calls out to the last fleeing local - a BOY with a lifevest.
</DIRECTION>
<VALENTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTINE>
<DIRECTION>
The boy stares back, defiantly inflates the life preserver.

<DIRECTION>
(cont'd) (exasperated)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forget it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTINE>
<DIRECTION>
The entire cargo has gone. An errant bullet falls off a shelf in the plane and rolls down the floor - Valentine picks it up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
YURI sits innocently on his soda crate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A frustrated African Interpol Agent, MBIZI, wound-up by the chase, rushes Yuri - slams him to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<MBIZI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You run from us.

<DIRECTION>
(flashing a machete in Yuri's face)
</DIRECTION>

	No, Mbizi. No, no, no.

Valentine drags Mbizi out of Yuri's earshot. Mbizi still wants a piece of Yuri - Valentine preventing him getting to the gunrunner.

Valentine returns to Yuri who is dusting himself off. Valentine handcuffs Yuri himself, picks up the soda crate and sits Yuri back on it.

Yuri remains handcuffed, sitting on the soda crate - dwarfed by the cargo plane. Valentine paces beside him.
</DIRECTION>
<VALENTINE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd) (ignoring him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are more prestigious assignments, you know. Keeping track of the nuclear arsenals. You would think it more critical to world security. It's not. Nine out of ten war victims today are killed by assault rifles and other small arms - like yours. Those missiles just sit in their silos. Your AK-47 - it's the real weapon of mass destruction.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTINE>
<DIRECTION>
Yuri regards his interrogator curiously. Despite the sun beating down, he feels obliged to give him his version of the facts of life.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want people dead, Agent Valentine. I admit, a shooting war is better for business. But I'd prefer people to fire my guns and miss. Just as long as they're firing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
He regards Valentine with something approaching pity.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I realize the unspeakable things that are done with my weapons. I also understand the unspeakable things that are done with Williams Sonoma carving knives and Wilson baseball bats and they aren't taking those off the market any time soon. People will always buy guns. Why not mine?

Valentine appears to have no answer.

<YURI>

	</DIALOGUE>

(unable to resist)

Now Valentine smiles.

<VALENTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am legally permitted to hold you for twenty-four hours without charging you.

</VALENTINE>
<DIRECTION>
Yuri looks away, knows where this is going.
</DIRECTION>
<VALENTINE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You may ask, why do I bother to do that? I can assure you, it is not because I enjoy your company. And you may be surprised to learn that it is not for any vindictive motive. No. The reason I delay you for every second of the permissible twenty-four hours, is that I am delaying your deadly trade and the deaths of your victims. I don't think of it as taking a day from you but giving a day to them. Some innocent man, woman or child somewhere has one more day on this earth because you are not free.

Valentine looks to his watch.

	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTINE>
<DIRECTION>
Valentine walks away. Yuri is left to ponder the notion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see time lapse photography of Yuri waiting out his twenty-four hours, under armed guard on the highway - stretching his legs, eating a suspicious-looking sandwich, going to the bathroom, the sun arcing across the sky - all the while his plane is being cannibalized by the locals. Finally the time lapse slows back into real time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Valentine returns in a Jeep with Mbizi and other Agents.

EXT. HIGHWAY. DUSK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
YURI starts to walk down the deserted highway alone - his cargo plane is now just another carcass in the jungle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CONVOY of armored personnel carriers barrels past him - the color: U.N. white. The lead car slams on its brakes, bringing the train to a stop. A woman pokes her head out of the window - CAPTAIN VIVIAN CARLISLE.

<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. Climb in.

Yuri steps back into a vehicle with which he is very familiar.

INT. HOTEL AFRICA - YURI'S HOTEL ROOM. NIGHT.

A weary YURI enters his room. Sitting on the green sofa - bound and gagged, face reduced to pulp, silver hair matted with blood - SIMEON.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus! Simeon!
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
ANDRE JNR., a FLUNKY and his CHEERLEADERS appear from behind the door, laughing at his shocked reaction.

	<DIALOGUE>
	You got here just in time. I was afraid he would die before you got a chance to kill him.

He offers Yuri a Beretta.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me?!

</YURI>
<ANDRE_JNR>

Yuri spits on Simeon.

<YURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. No. I...
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
Andre offers him the gun a third time. Yuri refuses it.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDRE_JNR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you do want him dead. You just don't want to kill him yourself? I understand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDRE_JNR>
<DIRECTION>
Andre grabs Yuri and presses the gun into Yuri's palm, clasping his own hand over Yuri's.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDRE_JNR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll do it together. A bonding experience.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDRE_JNR>
<DIRECTION>
Andre forces Yuri's finger onto the trigger as he aims at the terrified Simeon - eyes pleading.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yuri attempts to pull his hand away but Andre is too strong.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDRE_JNR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can stop if you want - but you do. Just say the word.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDRE_JNR>
<DIRECTION>
Andre stares at Yuri not Simeon.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDRE_JNR>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say, "stop".
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDRE_JNR>
<DIRECTION>
Yuri opens his mouth but no word comes. Andre presses Yuri's finger onto the trigger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The gun goes off. A splash of blood across the sofa's green upholstery.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The gunshot echoes around the room. Simeon is very dead.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop.

Andre smiles.

INT. HOTEL AFRICA - LIBERIA. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
YURI collapses on the bar - gestures to the BARMAN who immediately pours a line of cocaine in full view.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
YURI hoovers it up.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I started doing a lot of cocaine in West Africa. I wasn't medicating myself. I was simply playing catch-up. I was constantly dealing with people who are chemically imbalanced without the aid of chemicals. It's just a matter of etiquette. It's rude to act sane in a room full of lunatics.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
The Barman nods to a patron at a corner table - a SEASONED FIGHTER - no more than eighteen years old.
</DIRECTION>
<BARMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He bought you "brown-brown", Mr. Yuri.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARMAN>
<YURI>
<DIRECTION>
(wiping his nose)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?

<BARMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Brown-brown".

<YURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<BARMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A mixture - cocaine and gunpowder.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARMAN>
<YURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What does the gunpowder do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<BARMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's magic. They give it to the small boys before battle - they do anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARMAN>
<YURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some other time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<BARMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have to try it at least once, Mr. Yuri.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The Barman starts chopping another line.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<BARMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(laughing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because it's your gunpowder.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Sure enough the Barman pours the gunpowder from one of Yuri's 39mm shells into the cocaine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SEASONED FIGHTER, assault rifle slung over his shoulder, intimidating air, sidles up to Yuri - stares him down. Yuri has no option, does a line.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He washes it down with a swig from a vodka bottle, raises his glass to the fighter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Barman puts on a Ukrainian folk song. Yuri picks out one of the PROSTITUTES in the bar, starts dancing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He drunkenly dances with one PROSTITUTE after another - the dance almost violent, the prostitutes flung aside, none lasting more than a few seconds - caught in the arms of the other PATRONS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
To Yuri, the bar swims before his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The music stops. Yuri, wild-eyed, looks at the stunned bar room.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
<DIRECTION>
(to no one in particular, whipping his vodka bottle off the bar)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going for a walk.

EXT. MONROVIA. NIGHT.

A MONTAGE OF SCENES FROM YURI'S P.O.V. IN HIS ALTERED STATE. [A MIXTURE OF FORMATS INCLUDING SUPER-8 & VIDEO, SHAKY HANDHELD FOOTAGE, OVER-EXPOSED FOOTAGE, BLACK & WHITE FOOTAGE EDITED OUT-OF- SEQUENCE WITH JUMP CUTS AND FLASH FRAMES]

<DIRECTION>
YURI staggers towards the edge of town - still swigging from his bottle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A ROOM WITH A CURVED CEILING ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF MONROVIA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
YURI, eyes unable to focus, stares at a WOMAN'S FACE in front of him, moving back and forth. The gyrating stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yuri realizes he is lying in the mouth of an enormous cement pipe on his back, a prostitute on top of him. She gets to her feet, adjusting her dress.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yuri panics, hurriedly zipping himself.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
<DIRECTION>
(a mixture of French and English)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't fuck you, did I? Did I fuck you?

(in French, as she counts Yuri's money)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not what I would call a fuck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROSTITUTE>
<DIRECTION>
The prostitute tosses a couple of bills back to him. Yuri ignores the money, staggers after her.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you sick?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
She ignores him.

Yuri staggers to his feet - wanders aimlessly across a field.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A DANCE IN DUST SOMEWHERE ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF MONROVIA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two dozen pairs of feet chase each other on a dirt field to cheers from a crowd. The dust clears, revealing a bundle of cloth and string doubling as a soccer ball. The game is between two indistinguishable teams of MONROVIAN YOUNGSTERS on a makeshift dirt field, goalposts constructed from tree branches lashed together.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
YURI wanders onto the field, joins the game without asking. The players humor him by letting him have the ball.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yuri dribbles up field, takes an enormous swipe at the ball, misses completely, clattering to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd and players laugh. The game goes on. Yuri, also laughing but in a far more desperate manner, picks himself up and wanders away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LIBERIAN BAR CALLED "ZANZI-BAR"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
YURI throws up at the back of a saloon flimsily constructed from rusted corrugated iron.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rinsing out his mouth with vodka, he is distracted by the sound of two little GIRLS arguing.
</DIRECTION>

The GIRLS approach Yuri - no older than seven, formal white dresses, hands politely behind their backs.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello.

</YURI>
<GIRL_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, will my fingers grow back?

One of the girls shows Yuri a healed stump where her hand should be.

Yuri runs away.

A MODERN SCULPTURE SOMEWHERE IN MONROVIA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
YURI passes in front of an abstract arrangement of holes that turns out to be a building pock-marked with gunshells.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly a FACE appears in one of the holes - SIMEON. The gunshot wound in his forehead still evident. Yuri gasps.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Simeon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
Simeon turns and walks away - revealing a large exit wound in the back of his head.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Simeon!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
Yuri pokes his head through the hole but Simeon has vanished. Yuri turns back to find himself trapped by TWO MEN in flip-flops, shorts, Gap T-shirts and AK-47's.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through Yuri's eyes the two men look like four. The two/four men go through Yuri's pockets, take his watch, shoes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yuri is oddly compliant - clumsily helping one of the thieves fasten the watch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the men, tired of Yuri's antics, aims his gun at Yuri's head. His colleague stops him.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't. He's Andre's.
	</DIALOGUE>

(seemingly beyond caring)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, fuck Andre.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
The man fires at Yuri. The gun jams. Yuri looks almost disappointed. The man tries again. Again the gun jams.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
<DIRECTION>
(referring to the gun)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. They don't usually do that. Let me have a look. Maybe I can fix it.

The man whips the gun across Yuri's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A PATH OUTSIDE MONROVIA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
YURI, face streaked with blood and dirt, wanders aimlessly through the brush outside Monrovia.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HYENA appears on the dirt path in front of him - teeth bared, frenzied eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yuri stares at the wild dog - starts to quietly cry. Tears roll down his cheeks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hyena runs away. Yuri is alone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:

A vacant-eyed YURI sits in the shadow of an enormous stack of arms, unloaded from a freighter.

A presidential motorcade appears on the dock. ANDRE BAPTISTE emerges out of his Mercedes Jeep, gun in his hand. He strides up to Yuri.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDRE_BAPTISTE>
	<DIALOGUE>

Andre Baptiste and Andre Jnr. are clearly taken with the idea.

	And now, one of the sponsors of tonight's evening, former Miss World, Ava Cordova.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASTER_OF_CEREMONIES>
<DIRECTION>
AVA appears from behind the wings in a designer gown. She modestly accepts the applause - gradually becomes aware of a projection on her face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns to see the projected image of a CHILD holding an AK-47.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When she turns back, tears are rolling down her face.

INT. NEW YORK HOUSE. NIGHT.

Back to us, AVA naked, sits on the end of her bed, clothes laid out beside her.

<YURI>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ava?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
YURI, still carrying his suitcase, appears in the doorway. He drops the case.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ava, what's wrong? Where's Nicki?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<AVA>
<DIRECTION>

Yuri senses something very wrong.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why aren't you dressed? I thought we were going out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
He finds a robe from the closet - gently places it around her. She pulls it off her shoulders.
</DIRECTION>
<AVA>
<DIRECTION>
(turning back to look at him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't wear the clothes. I can't wear the jewelry. I can't drive the car. I can't live in this house. Everything1s got blood on it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AVA>
<DIRECTION>
Yuri pulls the robe back onto her shoulders, walks to the window.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be so melodramatic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
Ava pulls the robe to her, follows Yuri to the window.
</DIRECTION>
<AVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course I'm melodramatic. I'm a failed actress, remember? We need to talk about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AVA>
<YURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why? We never have before.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<AVA>

Yuri notices the Interpol business card on the bedside table.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These people - you can't trust them--
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<AVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--I've talked to your parents. Why do you think they don't want your money? They know where it comes from. We all know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AVA>
<DIRECTION>
Yuri sighs, resigned.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I sell people a means to defend themselves, Ava. That's all. I don't hold a gun to any one's head and make them shoot--
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<AVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--Yuri, I see the news. Sierra Leone--
	</DIALOGUE>
</AVA>
<YURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--I don't sell machetes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<AVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--What do you think is pointing at the victims when they use those machetes? I see the pictures. Yuri, the guns are bigger than the boys.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AVA>
<YURI>
<DIRECTION>
(angered)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's nothing illegal about what I do.

<DIRECTION>
Ava meets his eye.

<AVA>

Yuri looks away.
</DIRECTION>
<AVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please stop.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AVA>
<YURI>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It makes no difference if I stop. Someone will take my place the next day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<AVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let them. We have enough. You're not that little boy in Odessa anymore, lining up for a loaf of bread--
	</DIALOGUE>
</AVA>
<YURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--It's not about the money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<AVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AVA>
<DIRECTION>
He doesn't answer - perhaps he doesn't have one. Ava looks out of the window at their expensive view.
</DIRECTION>
<AVA>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I feel like all I've done my whole life is be pretty. All I've done is be born. I'm not just a failed actress. I'm also a failed writer, failed artist, failed businesswoman. I'm not much good as a mother. Come to think of it, I'm not even that pretty any more. I've failed at everything, Yuri.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turning back to him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I won't fail as a human being. I'm leaving.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AVA>
<DIRECTION>
The words finally register with Yuri.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't leave. I'll stop.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as if trying to convince himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll stop.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
Ava is skeptical. He holds her, reassures her.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been thinking about it for a while. A lot, lately.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as if trying to convince himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm making more from the oil and timber anyhow.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(further reassurance)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll stop.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
She interrogates his eyes for the truth.
</DIRECTION>
<AVA>
<DIRECTION>
(pleading eyes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You will? You promise?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AVA>
<YURI>
<DIRECTION>
(deadly serious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(changing the subject a millisecond too fast)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now get dressed. We'll go out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
Ava picks up the dress off the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yuri gazes at her.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By the way, you're wrong about not being pretty any more.

She turns back and smiles.

<YURI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For the next month I stopped running guns. I went legitimate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
The van door opens to reveal VALENTINE and other INTERPOL AGENTS, wearing headsets, monitoring a scanner device. The agents read porn to keep themselves amused - except Valentine.

	<DIALOGUE>
	No wonder Valentine was confused.

INT. UPPER EAST SIDE APARTMENT. DUSK.

YURI toys with his old BULLET pendant as he talks on the phone.

For once the spreadsheets in front of him deal with oil and timber.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank God there are still legal ways to exploit developing countries.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
With the cordless phone to his ear, Yuri wanders to the kitchen. He tosses the pendant down a trash chute.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Back in the den, Yuri punches a calculator as he continues his phone call.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But the only problem with an honest buck is they're so hard to make. The margins are too low. Too many people are doing it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
Finally we are privy to the conversation.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
<DIRECTION>
(into phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--Impossible. Two and a quarter? I can't make a profit at two and a quarter. Why don't you take my oil and I'll fucking pay you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
Yuri hangs up, stares down from his apartment window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Valentine's panel truck drives away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Night has fallen over Central Park - criss-crossed by a necklace of lights. Yuri continues to stare out of the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is perplexed by the sight of a diplomatic motorcade parked in front of his building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Before he can make sense of it, the house phone rings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AVA enters.

<AVA>

ANDRE BAPTISTE is admiring his new uniform in a gilt edged mirror.

ANDRE JNR. is flirting with two TEENAGE GIRLS - residents of the building. The perplexed DOORMAN stares at the motorcade outside his door - flashing lights on the police escort.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDRE_JNR>
<DIRECTION>
(to the girls)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--You should come to Liberia with me tomorrow. It is beautiful this time of year.

	So at the same time you thought you'd drop in on your arms dealer?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<ANDRE_BAPTISTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that what you still are? You're a hard man to get hold of all of a sudden.

(a smile, for once correcting Yuri)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Witch-hunt". But I have been granted diplomatic immunity due to the escalation in hostilities.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(conspiratorial)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That is why I need you. They are making life difficult to re-supply. It will require a man of your unusual ingenuity.

	I can't help you. I'm sorry.

Yuri realizes that Andre has placed a huge uncut diamond in his hand.

AVA, NICOLAI in tow, approaches Yuri's locker.

</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)

	I can put myself in Ava's place. She might have understood if the combination was the last four digits of my social, my birthdate, even her birthdate but not Nicolai's.

Ava looks to Nicolai, tries one more combination, reluctantly.

Ava opens the storage room door - at first struck by the exhibition of her paintings inside the locker. Shaking the image from her head, she turns her attention to the briefcases and other documents.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She shuffles through the passports in horror - different photos of Yuri, different names: "George Eagleman", "Georges D'Aigle", etc. Who is her husband? Is he any of them?

	<DIALOGUE>
	That's because it's not true.

Vitaly is hardly surprised.

	Every faction in Africa calls themselves by these noble names - "liberation-this", "patriotic-that", "democratic-republic-of- something or other". I guess they can't own up to what they usually are - "federation- of-worse-oppressors-than-the last-bunch-of- oppressors". Often the most barbaric atrocities occur when both combatants proclaim themselves "freedom fighters".

A tent city. A Jeep packed with young, machete-wielding FREEDOM FIGHTERS circles the refugee camp, taunting and terrorizing the inhabitants.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The mostly WOMEN and CHILDREN are trapped by the circling Jeep. Whenever a refugee attempts to escape, they are driven back by the increasingly manic, shrieking rebels.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yuri's two trucks are parked on the roadway above the camp where the rest of the REBELS are massed - a rag-tag mob wearing over-sized sneakers, carrying machetes and the occasional AK-47.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At a small folding table a REBEL LEADER negotiates with YURI and ANDRE JNR. The Leader places a pile of uncut diamonds on the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VITALY is more interested in the camp - observing the circling Jeep full of Rebels and their smirking comrades on the highway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From a distance, he spies a WOMAN and YOUNG SON make a desperate bid for escape from the camp. Two REBELS, on foot, give chase. The woman appears to be pregnant.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vitaly watches in horror. The Woman is quickly overtaken and hacked to death. Then the Boy. Vitaly can't look, turns away.
</DIRECTION>
<VITALY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VITALY>
<DIRECTION>
Vitaly comes to a horrific realization.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He hurries to Yuri, still negotiating with the Rebel Leader.
</DIRECTION>
<VITALY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yuri, I need to talk to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VITALY>
<YURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<VITALY>
<DIRECTION>
(insistent)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VITALY>
<YURI>
<DIRECTION>
(to the Rebel Leader)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
Vitaly draws Yuri out of earshot.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
<DIRECTION>
(irritated by the interruption)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<VITALY>
<DIRECTION>
(anxious whisper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can't do this deal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VITALY>
<YURI>
<DIRECTION>
(incredulous)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The fuck we can't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<VITALY>
<DIRECTION>
(referring to the camp)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look over there. As soon as we leave, they're going to die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VITALY>
<YURI>
<DIRECTION>
(averting his eyes from the camp)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not our business.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<VITALY>
<DIRECTION>
(protesting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They killed a boy just now - as young as Nicki.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VITALY>
<DIRECTION>
Yuri flinches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The suspicious Rebel Leader and Andre Jnr. approach the two brothers.
</DIRECTION>
<REBEL_LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the hold up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REBEL_LEADER>
<YURI>
<DIRECTION>
(trying to keep his poise)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is no hold up. I'll be right there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
Yuri draws Vitaly further away.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vitaly, it's what we always know - we can't control what they do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<VITALY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Today we can. They're right there - close enough to touch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VITALY>
<YURI>
<DIRECTION>
(angry, impatient)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you think they'll do if we back out - they'll kill us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<VITALY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And if we go ahead - they'll kill them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VITALY>
<DIRECTION>
The Rebel Leader approaches again - this time he's not leaving.
</DIRECTION>
<REBEL_LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is he saying?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REBEL_LEADER>
<YURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
Vitaly realizes the futility of the discussion, backs down.
</DIRECTION>
<VITALY>
<DIRECTION>
(resigned)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing. You're right, Yuri. You're right.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(getting his head back in the game)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did I hear you say 300 IPG's, 500 assault rifles and 800 grenades? I thought it was 1,200 grenades. I'd better check.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VITALY>
<DIRECTION>
Yuri pats his brother on the back, returns to the negotiating table. Vitaly heads for the trucks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For once we follow Vitaly. Andre Jnr. regards Vitaly warily.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRUCK. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The prongs of a hammer on a box of grenades. VITALY is prying open the lid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andre Jnr. appears behind him - M60 poised ominously on his hip.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDRE_JNR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDRE_JNR>
<VITALY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something for Yuri.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VITALY>
<ANDRE_JNR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Step away - slowly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDRE_JNR>
<DIRECTION>
Vitaly closes the lid - a ruse. He picks up the hammer and in one sudden, violent motion swings it across Andre's face, smashing his jaw, teeth flying, Andre's body flopping like a rag doll.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vitaly grabs two grenades from the box, pulls the pin from one and bowls it into the truck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He runs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The truck explodes in a fireball - instantly incinerating Andre Jnr.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yuri's head whips around. The Rebel Leader's head whips around.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vit!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
Vitaly dashes for the second truck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The REBEL LEADER opens fire, raking Vitaly with machine-gun fire - still trying to run with legs torn to shreds.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
A second hail of gunfire - all REBELS firing. Vitaly's legs betray him. He collapses to the ground in a pile of blood and dust.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We focus on Vitaly's still FACE - he has taken enough bullets to kill him three times over. But he is not quite dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Agonizingly slow, he raises the grenade hand to his mouth - pulls the pin with his teeth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE on Vitaly's HAND, trying to summon the strength to throw the grenade.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hand appears, grasps Vitaly's hand - gently but firmly removing the grenade.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
YURI.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Rebels keep their guns trained on Yuri, unsure where his loyalties lie. Yuri holds the fate of the camp in his hands - he could still toss the grenade, destroy the second truck, sacrifice his life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yuri stares to his brother and then to the grenade in his hand. He reaches down and delicately takes the pin from between Vitaly's lips.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The eyes of the brothers meet for the last time. Yuri inserts the pin into the grenade, disarming it - the life goes from Vitaly's eyes forever.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yuri removes any last doubt by tossing the disarmed grenade to the Rebel Leader.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yuri walks away from Vitaly's dead body and returns to the negotiating table - Yuri now the living dead. The Rebel Leader looks to the two trucks - one burning, one not. He removes half of the diamonds from the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TRUCK. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
YURI sits in the cab, staring out of the window as the truck drives away.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vitaly broke the cardinal rule of gunrunning. Never pick up a gun and join the customers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
The truck turns the bend. In the background, true to Vitaly's prediction, the rebels descend on the tent village, firing indiscriminately with their new weapons.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yuri hears the sound - we detect a barely perceptible flinch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. REAR OF TRUCK. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A lone gun crate, emptied of its contents has been put to use as VITALY's makeshift coffin.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Coffins are hard to come by in Sierra Leone. Demand is so high. Fortunately, we had a lot of boxes just the right size.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SIERRA LEONE MARKET. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"America's Funniest Home Videos" plays on a TV set. The canned laughter appears to be almost directed at YURI who is making a long- distance call on a geriatric telephone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We aren't privy to the conversation.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know which is worse, Jewish guilt or Catholic guilt. My parents were like God's tag-team.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
We pull back to reveal the makeshift coffin sitting at Yuri's feet.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I could not deny them the chance to say goodbye to their eldest son.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
INT. J.F.K. AIRPORT - CUSTOMS BAY. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON the screen of an X-RAY machine. Innocuous oversize cargo passes in front of the screen - a surfboard, a double bass, then the crate containing VITALY's body.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For twenty Monrovian dollars a doctor removed the lead from Vitaly's body and wrote a bogus death certificate. I should have paid more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
The OPERATOR of the machine, stops the conveyor belt.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've smuggled millions of rounds of ammunition and the bullet that lands me in jail is found under my dead brother's rib.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
In Vitaly's chest, a bullet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. J.F.K. AIRPORT - CONVEYOR BELT. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The other oversize items move down the conveyor belt for collection - YURI waits with two burly PORTERS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No other items are appearing - finally the coffin containing VITALY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two ATF AGENTS appear behind Yuri.
</DIRECTION>
<AGENT>
<DIRECTION>
(flashing some ID)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yuri Orlov, we're with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGENT>
<YURI>
<DIRECTION>
(resigned smile, regarding the insignia on their jackets)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Believe it or not, I only use the first two.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
The agents are not amused - handcuff Yuri.
</DIRECTION>
<AGENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have the right to remain silent. Use it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGENT>
<DIRECTION>
They march him away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NEW YORK APARTMENT. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A phone rings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AVA, out in the hallway, surrounded by suitcases, looks to the phone, senses the identity of the caller.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She hustles NICOLAI out of the door, closes it behind her. The phone continues to ring.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MANHATTAN CENTRAL JAIL. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
YURI, on a payphone, in the jailhouse corridor, reluctantly hangs up. He makes another call.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. "THE CRIMEAN" RESTAURANT - BRIGHTON BEACH. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANATOLY, lighting a candle, picks up the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<ANATOLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Crimean Restaurant".
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANATOLY>
<YURI>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Papa?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
Anatoly looks at the telephone receiver in his hand - without another word he passes the phone to IRINA. ANATOLY walks away.
</DIRECTION>
<IRINA>
<DIRECTION>
(into phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Both my sons are dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRINA>
<DIRECTION>
INT. INTERVIEW ROOM. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON a SLUG in an evidence bag tossed onto a table - by VALENTINE. The Agent can scarcely contain his excitement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
YURI sits at the small table, stares at the slug.
</DIRECTION>
<VALENTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One of yours?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTINE>
<DIRECTION>
Yuri doesn't take the bait.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two other AGENTS sit at the back of the room observe the interrogation.
</DIRECTION>
<VALENTINE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd) (referring to a document)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Curiously, the death certificate says he died of heart failure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTINE>
<YURI>
<DIRECTION>
(shrug)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe he did.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(referring to the slug)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I saw one of those coming at me, l'd have heart failure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
The flippant comment gets under Valentine's skin but he keeps his temper in check.
</DIRECTION>
<VALENTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We performed the autopsy and released your brother's body to your family. You tried to do something decent, Yuri. You went against your nature. And now it's cost you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(unable to resist)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your brother's funeral is looking a lot like your funeral.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTINE>
<YURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Falsifying a death certificate? That's not going to hold me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<VALENTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're right, as usual.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTINE>
<DIRECTION>
Yuri not so cocky now - waits to see where this is going.
</DIRECTION>
<VALENTINE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd) (putting a copy of the New York Times in front of Yuri)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you seen today's paper?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTINE>
<DIRECTION>
A front photograph of VALENTINE posing beside Yuri's documents including his five BRIEFCASES. The headline reads, "MERCHANT OF DEATH IN CUSTODY". Caption - "Catalogue of carnage."
</DIRECTION>
<VALENTINE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd) (pacing, lauding it over Yuri)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fake end-user certificates, cut-out companies, all meticulously catalogued. There's hardly a dictator, warlord or despot anywhere in the world you aren't on first name terms with.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(producing another evidence bag
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	containing Ava's diamond earrings
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
and an engagement ring)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your trophy wife gave us the prize. She also provided us with these - which we suspect are conflict diamonds.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTINE>
<DIRECTION>
Yuri takes all this in.
</DIRECTION>
<VALENTINE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She has agreed to testify against you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTINE>
<DIRECTION>
Yuri nods - picks up the newspaper. But instead of reading about his own front page news, he opens the paper, turns to World Affairs - various items on the warzones at the end of the millennium.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yuri reads, takes his time. Valentine cannot believe his audacity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally Yuri reacts. A broad smile - his killer smile.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Enjoy it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<VALENTINE>
<DIRECTION>
(confused)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTINE>
<YURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This. Tell me that I am everything you despise, that I am the personification of evil, that I'm responsible for the breakdown of the social fabric of society and world order, that I am a one man genocide. Say everything you want to say to me now - because you don't have long.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
Valentine is infuriated by Yuri's casual demeanor.
</DIRECTION>
<VALENTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you not paying attention or are you delusional? You've broken every arms embargo written. There's enough in those briefcases to buy you consecutive life sentences. You'll spend ten years going from a cell to a courtroom before you even start doing your time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTINE>
<DIRECTION>
Yuri is looking away, apparently completely unconcerned. His attitude further angers Valentine.
</DIRECTION>
<VALENTINE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't seem to fully appreciate the seriousness of your situation!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTINE>
<YURI>
<DIRECTION>
(snapping back - his emotion finally showing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My family has disowned me. My wife and son have left me. My brother is dead. Trust me, I fully appreciate the seriousness of my situation. But I promise you I won't spend a single second in a courtroom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
Valentine laughs derisively.
</DIRECTION>
<VALENTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are delusional.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTINE>
<DIRECTION>
Yuri is still unfazed. He leans forward to close the deal.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like you, Jack. Well, maybe not. But I understand you. You feel your loyalty to your badge has finally been rewarded. But you haven't counted on the people who gave you that badge.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
Valentine's turn to hesitate.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd) (meeting Valentine's gaze)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me tell you what's going to happen so you can prepare yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
Yuri nods to the interview room door.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Soon there's going to be a knock on that door and you're going to be called outside.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
A montage of scenes - Yuri's prediction plays out accompanied by his commentary.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. INTERVIEW ROOM. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A knock at the door and an AGENT nods to VALENTINE.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In the hall there will be a man who outranks you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY - JAIL. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sure enough, a decorated military OFFICER talks to VALENTINE in the hallway as Yuri describes.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First, he will compliment you on the fine job you've done, how you're making the world a safer place and then he is going to tell you that I am to be released.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
We observe valentine's reaction - vigorously arguing with his superior.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are going to protest, you will probably threaten to resign.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
The Officer, still turned away from us, tries to calm Valentine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY - JAIL. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door to the interview room opens.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But in the end I will be released.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
Yuri exits the cell to freedom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We return to the present.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. INTERVIEW ROOM. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VALENTINE's eyes burn into YURI.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
<DIRECTION>
(glancing to the open newspaper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The reason I'll be released is the same reason you think I will be convicted. I do rub shoulders with the most vile, sadistic men calling themselves leaders today.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(referring to the newspaper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But some of those men are the enemies of your enemies.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
Valentine is starting to get a sick feeling.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And while the biggest arms dealer in the world is your boss, the President of the United States - who ships more merchandise in a day than I do in a year - sometimes it's embarrassing to have his fingerprints on the guns. Sometimes he needs a freelancer like me to supply opposition forces he can't be seen supplying. You call me evil, but, unfortunately for you, I am a necessary evil.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
There is a long silence. Then,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A KNOCK AT THE DOOR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Valentine and Yuri exchange a look. Valentine rises from the desk.
</DIRECTION>
<VALENTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would tell you to go to hell. But I think you're already there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTINE>
<DIRECTION>
Valentine turns on his heel. He is at the door when Yuri finally replies.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if I'm not? What if I sleep fine at night? What if I sleep better than you? I think that's what truly scares you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
Valentine doesn't look back, exits. Sure enough, the Officer is in the hall as Yuri predicted - COLONEL SOUTHERN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MANHATTAN JAIL - REAR EXIT. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A car trunk closes on Yuri's five briefcases and other documents.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
YURI is escorted out the rear entrance of the city jail to the nondescript sedan by COLONEL SOUTHERN. As he's ushered into the car, Southern hands Yuri yet another briefcase.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLONEL SOUTHERN ushers Yuri into the car, hands him yet another briefcase as the car door closes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NONDESCRIPT SEDAN. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
YURI rides alone with the briefcase on his lap.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Most people are happy just to get out of jail. I expect to be paid to leave.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
Yuri opens the case - BALES OF CASH.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not a fool. I know that just because they need me one day doesn't mean they won't make me a scapegoat the next. But I was back doing what I do best.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MANHATTAN. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The nondescript sedan melts into rush-hour traffic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE EAST - DESERT CHECKPOINT. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A checkpoint in the desert - the fence a literal line in the sand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
YURI accompanies a convoy of trucks. He is joking with a BORDER OFFICER - back to doing what he loves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Border Officer inspects the crates in a truck, reads the manifest marked, "UMBRELLAS - QTY: 4,040 units".
</DIRECTION>
<BORDER_OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
(skeptical)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Umbrellas - to Saudi Arabia?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BORDER_OFFICER>
<YURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sun umbrellas.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
Yuri hands the Officer a plain, brown paper bag. The Officer looks inside - a wad of cash.
</DIRECTION>
<BORDER_OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have a safe trip.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BORDER_OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
The Officer waves the convoy through.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DESERT - BATTLEFIELD. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The desert where we first found YURI, the aftermath of a battle. He speaks directly to camera once again.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For someone who's never fired a gun or been in a battle, I have suffered many casualties in my life. I guess that's how I survived. I never went to war...
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
His thought is interrupted by a burst of gunfire.
