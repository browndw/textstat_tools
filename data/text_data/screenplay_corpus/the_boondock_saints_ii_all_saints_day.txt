EXT. BOYLESTON STREET, BOSTON -- MORNING

<DIRECTION>
The boulevard is empty, eerie silence. No cars, no people. A man walks down the middle of the street, long trench, dark shades. Though he does not speak, we hear...

	There's two kinds of people in this world when you boil it all down. You got your talkers and you got your doers.

We recognize this man as ROCCO. He crosses Copley Square toward the looming dome of the Trinity Church.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Most people are just talkers. All they got is talk. But when all's said and done, it is the doers who change the world. And when they do that, they change us. That's why we never forget them...So, which one are you? Do you just talk about it? Or do you stand up and do something about it? Because believe you me all the rest of it is just coffee house bullshit.

SUBTEXT: "Ireland"

From behind we see two men perched atop a boulder. A flock of sheep encircles them. Their army sacks and shotguns are nearby. They roll their own cigarettes with effortless synchronicity and light up. CONNOR and MURPHY MacMANUS (30's) now have long hair with heavy facial growth. Rugged. Piercing eyes. Looking to the horizon...

Very early dawn, shadowy morning light. Connor and Murphy sip coffees and look out into the rain. Lightening lights up the flock.

<DIRECTION>
Through the open door behind them, Poppa M stokes a warm fire.

Connor touch the Celtic Cross tattoo on his forearm. The boys look at each other as the rain suddenly stops and all the "little sounds" of morning cease. Something's amiss. Thunder. Ominous music as...

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOSTON: A frantic priest in his 50's weeps and begs as Crew Cut slams him to his knees with a .9 mm to his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IRELAND: The wolves savagely attack the screaming sheep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOSTON: Muzzle flash, blood splatters on the altar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IRELAND: BOOM! BOOM! Connor and Murphy blast shotguns at the wolves. One is hit, the rest retreat. The boys perform mercy killings on the wolf and one sheep.

Downpour. A rugged old jeep tears through the mud. It stops at the farmhouse. Poppa M and the boys come out onto the porch. A dark figure with a fedora and rain slicker exits the jeep and hurries to the porch. Meet Uncle SIBEAL (62yrs). He wears a priest's collar.

Breaking news. REPORTER #1 is live from outside a church. Squads, coroner's vans, CSI etc. Police hold back crowds.
</DIRECTION>
<REPORTER_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is no new information on the victim found slain this morning inside Trinity Church. As you can see the size of the crowd here has increased substantially over the last couple of hours. People are demanding answers as to how a priest could be murdered in a church. But perhaps more shocking, we have confirmed that the body was ritualized with pennies in the eyes. Many remember this as the grisly calling card of the prolific vigilante killers known as the Saints, who went on a murder spree here in Boston.

MOODY MUSIC: The boys begin to look more like "themselves" as the they cut their hair and beards with sheep sheers.

	Their interest, Detective, is capturing the men responsible for the murders of 22 of Boston's finest criminals. Y'see public perception is that these boys stepped in, did our jobs for us and then disappeared into thin air as we fecklessly searched for them. The FBI tends to take exception to such things. They coulda sent anyone. They sent me. Why do you think that is?

	Well, since we've broken the "Fuck Barrier," allow me to be blunt. It is because I am so fucking smart that I make smart people feel like retards.

<DOLLY>

Eunice stands right in front of Dolly.

The CHIEF (50's) sits, arms folded. The detectives are present. Eunice stands before a wall adorned with crime scene photos, reports, Concezio and his Capos.

	Why would Yakavetta want them back here? Him of all people.

	The Saints killed his daddy six years ago, right? He was inside when that happened doing a nickel for extortion.

</GREENLY>
<DOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. From inside he could only do so much. Since he got out nine months ago, the Yakavetta's have regained their original strength. Looks like their clearing all their open accounts.

	Look, I been stone walling the media on this thing but the Mayor's been riding me like a rented mule here. I got half of New England thinking the Saints whacked a priest and the other half thinking their innocent. Its a powder keg. I'm talking riot gear at Celtics games, here. I could clear them of this murder, take the piss right out of this thing, keep the peace in the Commonwealth. Gimme one good reason why I shouldn't go public right now.

	I understand you got a job to do, Chief. But if Yakavetta even sniffs that we're onto him, he puts a bullet in Napoleon's head, plants him at the bottom of the ocean and walks.

Uneasy, the woman continues her work as Eunice lotions her hands. She covertly replaces the masseuse and motions her out of the room. Eunice digs in as the fatted mobster moans with pleasure.

	You know what's always tripped me out? How hundreds of years ago, a bunch of desperate gamblers in leaky ass ships, crossed the ocean blue. They had no clue what was on the other side of it. Took real balls. But they sailed into infinity and made it all the way to the shores of the New fucking World...

INT. GREENHOUSE -- SAME TIME

The Roman, swirls a tomato in a plate of salt and bites into it. Beside him, a horned phonograph plays 40's Jazz. Behind him, we see that the greenhouse is merely an extension of the home.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Roman sits in front of a sunken fire pit at a low flame. Across the pit, an empty chair. Extended before him is a stunning garden, standing in stark contrast to the common house: vines, flowers, cobblestone walks, fountains. The center piece is a Turkish pool with pure white Lillys afloat. Poppa M slowly approaches the Roman from behind. He holsters his weapon and sits. The Roman halts the phonograph.

The double doors crash in and men barrel through as Poppa M turns, pulls two weapons and fires upon them, hitting one.

The garden is being torn apart as the brothers, Poppa M and Romeo hit their marks and the hit squad returns fire. The boys dive behind fountains which are then pulverized.
