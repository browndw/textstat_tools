INT. BAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A smoky cocktail bar downtown Detroit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLARENCE WORLEY, a young hipster hepcat, is trying to pick up an older lady named LUCY. She isn't bothered by him, in fact, she's alittle charmed. But, you can tell, that she isn't going to leave her barstool.
</DIRECTION>
<CLARENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In "Jailhouse Rock" he's everything rockabilly's about. I mean he is rockabilly: mean, surly, nasty, rude. In that movie he couldn't give a fuck about anything except rockin' and rollin', livin' fast, dyin' young, and leaving a good-looking corpse. I love that scene where after he's made it big he's throwing a big cocktail party, and all these highbrows are there, and he's singing, "Baby You're So Square... Baby, I Don't Care". Now, they got him dressed like a dick. He's wearing these stupid-lookin' pants, this horrible sweater. Elvis ain't no sweater boy. I even think they got him wearin' penny loafers. Despite all that shit, all the highbrows at the party, big house, the stupid clothes, he's still a rude-lookin' motherfucker. I'd watch that hillbilly and I'd want to be him so bad. Elvis looked good. I'm no fag, but Elvis was good-lookin'. He was fuckin' prettier than most women. I always said if I ever had to fuck a guy... I mean had too 'cause my life depended on it... I'd fuck Elvis.

The sounds of the city flow in through an open window: car horns, gun shots and violence. Paint is peeling off the walls and the once green carpet is stained black.
</DIRECTION>

On the bed nearby is a huge open suitcase filled with clear plastic bags of cocaine. Shotguns and pistols have been dropped carelessly around the suitcase. On the far end of the room, against the wall, is a TV. "Bewitched" is playing.

	Look, goddamnit, I never asked you for a goddamn thing! I've tried to make your parental obligation as easy as possible. After Mom divorced you, did I ask you for anything? When I wouldn't see ya for six months to a year at a time, did you ever get your shit about it? No, it was always "OK", "No problem", "You're a busy guy, I understand". The whole time you were a drunk, did I ever point my finger at you and talk shit? No! Everybody else did. I never did. You see, I know that you're just a bad parent. You're not really very good at it. But I know you love me. I'm basically a pretty resourceful guy. If I didn't really need it I wouldn't ask. And if you say no, don't worry about it. I'm gone. No problems.

That's as good as it's ever gonna get, and it won't ever get that good again. We talked to your neighbors.

That whore your boy hangs around with, her pimp is an associate of mine, and I don't just mean pimpin', in other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity. Well, apparently, that dirty little whore found out when we're gonna do some business, 'cause your son, the cowboy and his flame, came in the room blastin' and didn't stop till they were pretty sure everybody was dead.

	It's a fact. Sicilians have nigger blood pumpin' through their hearts. If you don't believe me, look it up. You see, hundreds and hundreds of years ago the Moors conquered Sicily. And Moors are niggers. Way back then, Sicilians were like the wops in northern Italy. Blond hair, blue eyes. But, once the Moors moved in there, they changed the whole country. They did so much fuckin' with the Sicilian women, they changed the blood-line for ever, from blond hair and blue eyes to black hair and dark skin. I find it absolutely amazing to think that to this day, hundreds of years later, Sicilians still carry that nigger gene. I'm just quotin' history. It's a fact. It's written. Your ancestors were niggers. Your great, great, great, great, great-grandmother was fucked by a nigger, and had a half-nigger kid. That is a fact. Now tell me, am I lyin'?

<ALABAMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Apparently, I was hit on the head with something really heavy, giving me a form of amnesia. When I came to, I didn't know who I was, where I was, or where I came from. Luckily, I had my driver's license or I wouldn't even know my name. I hoped it would tell me where I lived but it had a Tallahassee address on it, and I stopped somebody on the street and they told me I was in Detroit. So that was no help. But I did have some money on me, so I hopped in a cab until I saw somethin' that looked familiar. For some reason, and don't ask me why, that theater looked familiar. So I told him to stop and I got out.

	That's what happened. In fact, when she died, it was considered to be the happiest time of her life. She'd been fucked over so much by men she didn't trust them. She was havin' this relationship with this guy and he asked her to marry him. Now, other people had asked to marry her before, but she couldn't be sure whether they really loved her or were just after her money. So, she said no. And the guy says, "Look, I really love you, and I wanna prove it. So have your lawyers draw up a paper that says no matter what happens, I can never get any of your money, and I'll sign it." So she did, and he asked her, and she said yes. And once they were engaged he told her a secret about himself that she never knew: he was a millionaire.

	</DIALOGUE>
</CLARENCE>
<ALABAMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At the bus station. He said I'd be a perfect call girl. And that he knew an agency in California that, on his recommendation, would handle me. They have a very exclusive clientele: movie stars, big businessmen, total white-collar. And all the girls in the agency get a grand a night. At least five hundred. They drive Porsches, live in condos, have stockbrokers, carry beepers, you know, like Nancy Allen in "Dressed to Kill". And when I was ready he'd call 'em, give me a plane ticket, and send me on my way. He says he makes a nice finder's fee for finding them hot prospects. But no one's gonna pay a grand a night for a girl who doesn't know whether to shit or wind her watch. So what I'm doin' for Drexl now is just sorta learnin' the ropes. It seemed like a lotta fun, but I don't really like it much, till last night. You were only my third trick, but you didn't feel like a trick. Since it was a secret, I just pretended I was on a date. An, um, I guess I want a second date.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALABAMA>
<CLARENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you. I wanna see you again too. And again, and again, and again. Bama, I know we haven't known each other long, but my parents went together all throughout high school, and they still got a divorce. So, fuck it, you wanna marry me?

It's pretty late at night. Clarence steps out of his red Mustang. He's right smack dab in the middle of a bad place to be in daytime. He checks the pulse on his neck; it's beating like a race horse. To pump himself up he does a quick Elvis Presley gyration.

Now, see we're sittin' down here, ready to negotiate, and you've already given up your shit. I'm still a mystery to you. But I know exactly where your ass is comin' from. See, if I asked you if you wanted some dinner and you grabbed an egg roll and started to chow down, I'd say to myself, "This motherfucker's carryin' on like he ain't got a care in the world. Who know? Maybe he don't. Maybe this fool's such a bad motherfucker, he don't got to worry about nothin', he just sit down, eat my Chinese, watch my TV." See? You ain't even sat down yet. On that TV there, since you been in the room, is a woman with her titties hangin' out, and you ain't even bothered to look. You just been starin' at me. Now, I know I'm pretty, but I ain't as pretty as a couple of titties.

	I'm not eatin' 'cause I'm not hungry. I'm not sittin' 'cause I'm not stayin'. I'm not lookin' at the movie 'cause I saw it seven years ago. It's "The Mack" with Max Julian, Carol Speed, and Richard Pryor, written by Bobby Poole, directed by Michael Campus, and released by Cinerama Releasing Company in 1984. I'm not scared of you. I just don't like you. In that envelope is some payoff money. Alabama's moving on to some greener pastures. We're not negotiatin'. I don't like to barter. I don't like to dicker. I never have fun in Tijuana. That price is non-negotiable. What's in that envelope is for my peace of mind. My peace of mind is worth that much. Not one penny more, not one penny more.

You could hear a pin drop. Once Clarence starts talking Marty goes on full alert. Drexl stops eating and the Whores stop breathing. All eyes are on Drexl. Drexl drops his chopsticks and opens the envelope. It's empty.

Before Drexl finishes his sentence he picks up the card table and throws it at Clarence, catching him of guard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marty comes up behind Clarence and throws his arm around his neck, putting him in a tight choke hold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clarence, with his free arm, hits Marty hard with his elbow in the solar plexus. We'll never know if that blow had any effect because at just that moment Drexl takes a flying leap and tackles the two guys.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All of them go crashing into the stereo unit and a couple of shelves that hold records, all of which collapse to the floor in a shower of LPs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marty, who's on the bottom of the pile, hasn't let go of Clarence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Since Drexl's on top, he starts slamming fists into Clarence's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clarence, who's sandwiched between these two guys, can't do a whole lot about it.

</DREXL>
<DIRECTION>
He hits Clarence hard in the face with both fists.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clarence, who has no leverage whatsoever, grabs hold of Drexl's face and digs his nails in. He sticks his thumb in Drexl's mouth, grabs a piece of cheek, and starts twisting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marty, who's in an even worse position, can do nothing but tighten his grip aroud Clarence's neck, until Clarence feels like his eyes are going to pop out of his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Drexl's face is getting torn up, but he's also biting down hard on Clarence's thumb.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clarence raises his head and brings it down fast, crunching Marty's face, and busting his nose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marty loosens his grip around Clarence's neck. Clarence wiggles free and gets up on his knees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Drexl and Clarence are now on an even but awkward footing. The two are going at each other like a pair of alley cats, not aiming their punches, keeping them coming fast and furious. They're not doing much damage to each other because of their positions, it's almost like a hockey fight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marty sneaks up behind Clarence and smashes him in the head with a stack of LPs. This disorients Clarence. Marty grabs him from behind and pulls him to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Drexl socks him in the face: one, two three! Then he kicks him hard in the balls.
</DIRECTION>

Marty lets go and Clarence hits the ground like a sack of potatoes. He curls up into a fetal position and holds his balls, tears coming out of his eyes.

Drexl's face is torn up from Clarence's nails.

Alabama's laying flat. She actually blacks out for a moment, but the salty taste of the blood in her mouth wakes her up. She opens her eyes and sees Virgil standing there, smiling. She closes them, hoping it's a dream. They open again to the same sight. She has never felt more helpless in her life.

Alabama's pretty beat up. She has a fat lip and her face is black and blue. She's crawling around on the floor. Virgil is tearing the place apart looking for the cocaine. He's also carrying on a running commentary.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIRGIL Now the first guy you kill is always the hardest. I don't care if you're the Boston Strangler or Wyatt Earp. You can bet that Texas boy, Charles Whitman, the fella who shot all them guys from that tower, I'll bet you green money that that first little black dot that he took a bead on, was the bitch of the bunch. No foolin' the first one's a tough row to hoe. Now, the second one, while it ain't no Mardi Gras, it ain't half as tough row to hoe. You still feel somethin' but it's just so deluted this time around. Then you completely level off on the third one. The third one's easy. It's gotten to the point now I'll do it just to watch their expressions change.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's tearing the motel room up in general. Then he flips the matress up off the bed, and the black suitcase is right there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alabama's crawling, unnoticed to where her purse is lying. Virgil flips open the black case and almost goes snow blind.
</DIRECTION>
<VIRGIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, well, well, looky here. I guess I just reached journey's end. Great. One less thing I gotta worry about.
	</DIALOGUE>

Virgil closes the case. Alabama sifts through her purse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls out her Swiss army knife, opens it up. Virgil turns toward her.
</DIRECTION>
<VIRGIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OK, Sugarpop, we've come to what I like to call the moment of truth -

CLOSEUP - Alabama's face. Virgil's right, she doesn't have anything to lose. Virgil's also right about his being the moment of truth. The ferocity in women that comes out at certain times, and is just here under the surface in many women all of the time, is unleashed. The absolute feeling of helplessness she felt only a moment ago has taken a one hundred and eighty degree turn into "I'll take this motherfucker with me if it's the last thing I do" seething hatred.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Letting out a bloodcurling yell, she raises the knfe high above her head, then drops to her knees and plunges it deep into Virgil's right foot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP - VIRGIL'S FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Talk about bloodcurling yells.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Virgil bends down and carefully pulls the knife from his foot, tears running down his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
While Virgil's bent down, Alabama smashes an Elvis Presley whiskey decanter that Clarence bought her in Oklahoma over his head. It's only made of plaster, so it doesn't kill him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Virgil's moving toward Alabama, limping on his bad foot.
</DIRECTION>
<VIRGIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OK, no more Mr. Nice-guy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIRGIL>
<DIRECTION>
Alabama picks up the hotel TV and tosses it to him. He instinctively catches it and, with his arms full of television, Alabama cold-cocks him with her fist in the nose, breaking it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her eyes go straight to the door, then to the sawed-off shotgun by it. She runs to it, bends over the chair for the gun. Virgil's left foot kicks her in the back, sending her flying over the chair and smashing into the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Virgil furiously throws the chair out of the way and stands over Alabama. Alabama's lying on the ground laughing. Virgil has killed a lot of people, but not one of them has ever laughed before he did it.
</DIRECTION>
<VIRGIL>

She laughs louder. Virgil's insane. He picks her off the floor, then lifts her off the ground and throws her through the glass shower door in the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<VIRGIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Laugh it up, cunt. You were in hysterics a minute ago. Why ain't you laughing now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIRGIL>
<DIRECTION>
Alabama, lying in the bathtub, grabs a small bottle of hotel shampoo and squeezes it out in her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Virgil reaches in the shower and grabs hold of her hair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alabama rubs the shampoo in his face. He lets go of her and his hands go to his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<VIRGIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh Jesus!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIRGIL>
<DIRECTION>
She grabs hold of a hefty piece of broken glass and plunges it into his face.
</DIRECTION>
<VIRGIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh Mary, help me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIRGIL>
<DIRECTION>
The battered and bruised and bloody Alabama emerges from the shower. She's clutching a big, bloody piece of broken glass. She's vaguely reminiscent of a Tasmanian devil. Poor Virgil can't see very well, but he sees her figure coming toward him. He lets out a wild haymaker that catches her in the jaw and knocks her into the toilet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He recovers almost immediately and takes the porcelain lid off the back of the toilet tank.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Virgil whips out a .45 automatic from his shoulder holster, just as Alabama brings the lid down on his head. He's pressed up against the wall with this toilet lid hitting him. He can't get a good shot in this tight environment, but he fires anyway, hitting the floor, the all, the toilet, and the sink.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The toilet lid finally shatters against Virgil's head. He falls to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alabama goes to the medicine cabinet and whips out a big can of Final Net hairspray. She pulls a Bic lighter out of her pocket, and, just as Virgil raises his gun at her, she flicks the Bic and sends a stream of hairspray through the flame, which results in a big ball of fire that hits Virgil right in the face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He fires off two shots. One hits the wall, another hits the sink pipe, sending water spraying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Upon getting his face fried Virgil screams and jumps up, knocking Alabama down, and runs out of the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Virgil collapses on the floor of the living room. Then, he sees the sawed-off laying on the ground. He crawls toward it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alabama, in the bathroom, sees where he's heading. She picks up the .45 automatic and fires at him. It's empty. She's on her feet and into the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches the shotgun, his hands grasp it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alabama spots and picks up the bloody Swiss army knife. She takes a knife-first-running-dive at Virgil's back. She hits him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He arches up, firing the sawed-off into the ceiling, dropping the gun, and sending a cloud of plaster and stucco all over the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alabama snatches the shotgun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Arched over on his back Virgil and Alabama make eye contact.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The first blast hits him in the shoulder, almost tearing his arm off. The second hits him in the knee. The third plays hell with his chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alabama then runs at him, hitting him in the head with the butt of the shotgun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ever since he's been firing it's as if some other part of her brain has been functioning independently. She's been absent-mindedly saying the prayer of Saint Francis of Assisi.

	Lord, make me an instrument of Thy peace; where there is hatred, let me sow love; where there is injury, pardon; where there is doubt, faith; where there is despair, hope; where there is darkness, light; and where there is sadness, joy. O Divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek to be consoled as to console; to be understood as to understand; to be loved as to love; for it is in giving that we receive, it is pardoning that we are pardoned, and it is in dying that we are born to eternal life.

	I feel so horrible about what she went through. That fucker really beat the shit out of her. She never told him where I was. It's like I always felt that the way she felt about me was a mistake. She couldn't really care that much. I always felt in the back of my mind, I don't know, she was jokin'. But, to go through that and remain loyal, it's very easy to be unraptured with words, but to remain loyal when it's easier, even excusable, not to - that's a test of oneself. That's a true romance.

She pulls back hammer. She looks up and sees her reflection in the rear-view mirror. She turns it the other way. She looks straight ahead. Her finger tightens on the trigger. She sees the napkin on the dashboard. She opens it up and reads it: "You're so cool".
