EXT. SAWYER'S BACKYARD--DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elegiac music murmurs as three female and barefoot PAIRS OF LEGS in skirts break from tableau to gently engage in Croquet. A blue mallet hits a blue ball through a wicket, a green mallet knocks a green ball, and a yellow mallet pushes forward a yellow ball, all in enticing syncopation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly a red ball rockets through the dew covered grass and hits the green ball. The LEGS all stop moving as a FOURTH PAIR OF LEGS, this one in stylish shoes and stockings, marches to the red ball and steps on it. A red mallet is brought down hard on the red ball causing the adjacent green ball to thunder out of view. The Pair of Legs manuevering the green ball departs. This process of elimination is grimly repeated with the yellow ball and yet again with the blue ball.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
However, when the BLUE MALLETED PLAYER makes her sad exit, the viewer's viewpoint glides along with this particular Pair of Legs. A red ball whizzes by. The Legs stop. Another red ball malevolently sails past the Legs. Then yet another red ball. A fourth red ball makes brutal contact with the Legs causing the Player to fall to her knees and into the frame. The Player is VERONICA SAWYER.

INT. VERONICA'S BEDROOM--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VERONICA SAWYER, a sullen seventeen year old beauty, lies atop her bed dressed in a chic but understated ensemble, her eyes glazed open in a morning reverie. She blows up at her bangs then slides off her bed, launching into voice-over narration over the empty bed.

Continuing her narration, VERONICA glides through a bustling high school hallway with a frozen smile.
</DIRECTION>
<VERONICA>

	<DIALOGUE>
	She said Real Life sucks Losers dry. If you want to fuck with the eagles, you have to learn to fly.

<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE CAFETERIA--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With her back turned to the viewer, VERONICA stands at the outskirts of the cafeteria entrance. The viewer's viewpoint approaches and finally curls around VERONICA to reveal that she is writing in a diary, wearing a monocle.
</DIRECTION>
<VERONICA>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said so you teach people how to spread their wings and fly. She said Yes.

THE DIARY PAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VERONICA'S pen sways across the diary page forming the words echoed by her voice-over.
</DIRECTION>
<VERONICA>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said You're Beautiful.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God, come on Veronica!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER_MCNAMARA>
<DIRECTION>
VERONICA coolly pops the monocle from her eye before angrily addressing the amusingly robust, conventionally beautiful, trendily coiffed HEATHER MCNAMARA.
</DIRECTION>
<VERONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's your damage, Heather? You ruined my...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERONICA>
<HEATHER_MCNAMARA>

	God, I'm so sure. Don't blame me, blame Heather. She told me to haul your ass into the caf pronto. Back me up, Heather.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER_MCNAMARA>
<DIRECTION>
From behind HEATHER MCNAMARA emerges a similarly trendily accessorized but noticeably more inhibited waif, HEATHER DUKE. She is clutching a tattered copy of "The Catcher in the Rye."

INT. INSIDE THE CAFETERIA--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VERONICA, flanked by HEATHER MCNAMARA and HEATHER DUKE, strides into the lunchroom pandemonium.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The stunning HEATHER CHANDLER turns from the tray before her toward her incoming comrades. She is dressed stylishly and expensively but not trendily; her hair, dramatically tied back.
</DIRECTION>
<VERONICA>
<DIRECTION>
(submissively)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Heather.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERONICA>
<DIRECTION>
Pulling out a crumpled piece of yellow paper, HEATHER CHANDLER smiles. The content of what Heather says is consistently offensive but the tone in which she speaks is sexy, dangerous, and mysterious. She is a mythic bitch.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER_CHANDLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Veronica. Finally. Got a paper of Kurt Kelly's. I need you to forge a hot and horny but realistically low-key note in Kurt's handwriting and we'll slip it into Martha Dumptruck's lunch tray.

</HEATHER_CHANDLER>
<VERONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit, Heather. I don't have anything against Martha Dunnstock.

</VERONICA>
<HEATHER_CHANDLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't have anything for her either. Come on, it'll be Very. The note'll give her shower nozzle masturbation material for weeks.

	It'd be so righteous to be in a Veronica Sawyer-Heather Chandler sandwich. Punch it in, Ram.

In slow motion, VERONICA finishes the note and rises up along with her makeshift desk, HEATHER DUKE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HEATHER MCNAMARA hawkishly gazes toward the cafeteria line.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VERONICA hands the note to an impressed HEATHER CHANDLER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK pays the CASHIER and then, grasping her lunch tray with both hands, moves toward VERONICA and the HEATHERS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HEATHER MCNAMARA excitedly tugs on HEATHER CHANDLER'S arm as MARTHA approaches. With a tranquil smile, HEATHER CHANDLER passes the note to her frantic disciple.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a self-consciously clandestine manner, HEATHER MCNAMARA saunters past MARTHA then wields around to sneakily tuck the note onto MARTHA's tray.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The slow motion concludes as their plump victim shuffles past a magnetic preppie PETER DAWSON and a thin, black, bespectacled DENNIS. The guys are working a large stand which has a cashbox reading THE FOODLESS FUND and a banner reading WESTERBURG FEEDS THE WORLD.
</DIRECTION>

</HEATHER_CHANDLER>
<DIRECTION>
VERONICA shakes her head and looks off. She's suddenly captured by the sight of a JAMES DEANESQUE GUY sitting stark in a long, tan gunslinger coat, behind a Rebel Without a Cause lunchbox. They make eye contact.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Transfixed, VERONICA crashes into seated BETTY FINN, a slightly overweight, unstylishly dressed sweetie surrounded by clones.

BETTY pulls from her purse a picture showing a YOUNG BETTY FINN AND VERONICA SAWYER, arm-in-arm, dressed in Halloween costumes: BETTY is an angel, VERONICA is a witch.

VERONICA glows at the photo until HEATHER CHANDLER tows VERONICA away causing the picture to fall face up on the floor.

COURTNEY expresses elation in spite of herself as HEATHER CHANDLER delicately takes a tot and turns around to face VERONICA. HEATHER CHANDLER inserts her finger in her mouth doing the "induce-vomiting" signal before devouring the tot and turning back around.
</DIRECTION>
<COURTNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks. I just got it last night at the Limited. Totally blew my allowance.

<DIRECTION>
Panting, VERONICA collapses at a desk in the "coat" room. She draws a Vodka bottle from a stockpile of liquor and pours some in her beer cup, slouching down in her chair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VERONICA lights a match from a 7-11 matchbook. She eerily brings her hand closer and closer to the fire until it touches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With an eek of pain, she tosses the match away into the Vodka cup, setting it afire. VERONICA laughs to herself before tossing the flaming cup out the window.

The flaming cup lands in a large rusted garbage can filled with other cups and various refuse. The flames spread...

VERONICA storms into the hallway but slows down when she sees she's attracting attention. She notices an incited BRAD slither to the smiling DAVID who chats with some STUDENTS, HEATHER CHANDLER on his arm.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Betty Finn was a true friend and I sold her out for a bunch of Swatchdogs and Diet Cokeheads. Killing Heather'd be like offing the Wicked Witch of the West. Or is it East? West!

VERONICA charges into the alley. She whips around to face a screeching HEATHER CHANDLER. In back of VERONICA, the trashcan bellows like Mt. Vesuvius.

J.D. gently bites in to VERONICA's neck. VERONICA grooves on it, closing her eyes tightly.

VERONICA slides her head down against J.D.'s chest and gracefully rests on his lap. Gently fighting slumber, she murmurs up to J.D., who showers her face with slow kisses.

VERONICA and J.D. make queasy eye-contact. VERONICA descends back into the refrigerator with some worked-up enthusiasm as J.D. suavely pours bits of various toxic containers (detergent, scouring powder) into a glass beer mug.
</DIRECTION>
<VERONICA>

	O-kay. We'll cook up some soup and put it in a Coke. Sick, eh? Now should it be Chicken-Noodle or Bean-with-Bacon?

	Man Veronica, pull the plug on that shit. I say we go with Big Blue.

	Okay we'll use this. She won't be able to tell what she's drinking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</J_D>
<DIRECTION>
J.D. pulls down a ceramic cup and triumphantly pours the poisonously blue beer glass contents into it. An eerie pause ensues. VERONICA takes out a milk carton and a container of orange juice. She struts back to the counter in anger, icily muttering.
</DIRECTION>
<VERONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just give me a cup, jerk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERONICA>

J.D. sheepishly pulls down an identical ceramic cup. VERONICA tears it from him and pours some milk and then some orange juice into the cup.

	Milk and orange juice. Hmmmm. Maybe we could cough a phlegm globber in it or something.

HEATHER CHANDLER rises from the bed and struts to J.D. in anger. She takes the cup, slams her head back and downs it all.

VERONICA stares off as J.D. paces like a caged animal. He scopes onto the rubble of the shattered coffee table and sees Cliff Notes for The Bell Jar plus a magazine proclaiming "THE FALL OF THE AMERICAN TEEN" under HEATHER CHANDLER's body.

	That's good, but Heather would never use the word "myriad."

	This is the last thing she'll ever write. She'll want to cash in on as many fifty-cent words as poss.

	She missed "myriad" on a vocab test two weeks ago, all right?

At the head of a long conference table is the bearlike PRINCIPAL GOWAN. Circling the table is the gray-haired but savvy MRS. POPE, the yuppie black counselor PAUL HYDE, TWO large DISCIPLINARIAN-TYPES, and most noticeably, the eccentrically dressed MS. PAULINE FLEMING. Coats are in chairs and cigarette smoke is in the air, as the group batters their way through a morning mourning conference.

<PAULINE>

The class stares to VERONICA as the suicide note is passed to her. She acknowledges it in horror, passes it on, then continues, realizing her ability to create truths for a captive audience.
</DIRECTION>
<VERONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She realized the only way she could be happy was to give up her power and the only way she could do that was Death.

VERONICA makes her way up a hill, pausing to compassionately stare at RAM on top of a dispirited HEATHER MCNAMARA. KURT's intoxicated brain has trouble dealing with the incline. Majestically, J.D. appears at the top of the hill. KURT squints up the hill and falls over backwards.

PETER tells VERONICA.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I rarely listen to Neanderthals like Kurt Kelly bu-ut he said you were bent over like a coffee table with Kurt going in one end and Ram coming in the other. Pardon the pun.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VERONICA arousingly speaks into her phone.
</DIRECTION>
<VERONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Kurt? This is Veronica Sawyer. I didn't expect to be calling either. I guess my emotions took over. I was wondering if you wanted all those things you've been saying to really happen. It's always been a fantasy of mine to have two guys at once...... Sure, you can write Penthouse Forum.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERONICA>
<DIRECTION>
Revealed to be lounging on her bed, J.D. laughs out loud. VERONICA throws a book at him.

INT. VERONICA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VERONICA and J.D. load guns on VERONICA's bed. VERONICA breaks into a laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<VERONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't get the point of me writing a suicide note when we'll just be shooting them with blanks.

</VERONICA>
<J_D>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get crucial. We won't be using blanks this time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</J_D>
<VERONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't be serious? Hey listen, my Bonnie-and-Clyde days are over.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERONICA>
<DIRECTION>
VERONICA drops her gun in revulsion and launches off her bed. With a patient smile, J.D. pulls her back down.
</DIRECTION>
<J_D>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you take German?

</J_D>
<VERONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	French.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERONICA>
<DIRECTION>
J.D. flicks open his gun and pulls a bullet from the chamber.
</DIRECTION>
<J_D>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These are Ich Luge bullets. My grandfather snared a shitload of them in W.W. Two. They're like tranquilizers only they break the surface of the skin, enough to cause blood, but not any real harm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</J_D>
<VERONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So it looks like the person's been shot and killed when they're really just unconscious and bleeding.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERONICA>
<DIRECTION>
J.D. nods then stands to pace the room, his mind whirring.
</DIRECTION>
<J_D>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We shoot Kurt and Ram. Make it look like they shot each other. By the time Kurt and Ram regain consciousness, they'll be the laughingstock's of the school. The note's the punchline. How'd it turn out?
	</DIALOGUE>
</J_D>
<DIRECTION>
VERONICA clumsily extracts the note from her purse. She also plucks out the crumpled yellow sample of Kurt's handwriting of the opening note-forge scene. She proudly displays both papers.
</DIRECTION>
<VERONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First tell me this similarity is not incredible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERONICA>
<J_D>
<DIRECTION>
(warmly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Incredible similarity.
	</DIALOGUE>
</J_D>
<DIRECTION>
VERONICA pulls back the note and reads.
</DIRECTION>
<VERONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ram and I died the day we realized we could never reveal our forbidden love to an uncaring and ununderstanding world. The joy we shared in each other's arms was greater than any touchdown. Yet we were forced to live the lie of Sexist- Beer Guzzling-Jock-Asshole.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERONICA>
<J_D>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exquisite, but I don't think ununderstanding is a word.
	</DIALOGUE>
</J_D>
<VERONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We don't want to make them out to be too secretly eloquent. Why would the Germans invent a bullet that doesn't kill people? I mean it was World War Two, not a school play.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERONICA>
<J_D>
<DIRECTION>
(rapid-fire)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They used them on themselves to make it look like they were dead. Really quite a brilliant device, but too flamboyant to seriously produce.

	Neat. Let's try it out on J.F.K.

VERONICA swiftly picks up her gun and aims it at the lovable tabby entering the room. J.D. rips it away from her.

J.D. lifts up a feminine shopping bag and gently dumps the contents on the bed.

J.D. reaches in both his coat pockets and triumphantly raises out two bottles of Perrier water.
</DIRECTION>
<J_D>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perrier water!
	</DIALOGUE>
</J_D>
<VERONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh come on. Lots of people drink Perrier. It's come a long way.

J.D. laughs then climbs onto VERONICA for a hugging kiss.

KURT feebly slams knuckles with RAM.

RAM smacks his hands together.

<RAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So do we just start fucking?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAM>
<VERONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've made a circle on each end of the clearing. Ram, you come over here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERONICA>
<DIRECTION>
KURT steps into the scratched-in-the-dirt circle next to him. A confused RAM walks past VERONICA and steps into a circle at the opposite end of the foggy clearing.
</DIRECTION>
<VERONICA>
<DIRECTION>
The guys pause, then slowly start taking off their clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<RAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAM>
<VERONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was hoping you'd rip my clothes off me, sport.

</VERONICA>
<RAM>

KURT and RAM awkwardly stand at opposite ends in their undies.

RAM giggles in anticipation.

KURT finally cracks a smile.

J.D. suddenly moves next to VERONICA holding a gun in his right hand and the feminine shopping bag in his left.
</DIRECTION>
<J_D>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Three.
	</DIALOGUE>
</J_D>
<DIRECTION>
J.D. almost non-chalantly shoots RAM in the forehead. VERONICA rips out her gun and swings it toward KURT. Using both hands, she fires, but misses completely. KURT runs away onto the path. VERONICA throws down her gun with a smile.
</DIRECTION>
<VERONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shucks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERONICA>
<DIRECTION>
J.D. races to VERONICA in a white sweat.
</DIRECTION>
<J_D>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you miss him completely?
	</DIALOGUE>
</J_D>
<VERONICA>
<DIRECTION>
(giggling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but don't worry, it was worth it just to see the look on....

<J_D>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't move! I'll get him back!

VERONICA's laughter cuts off like a faucet. Suddenly trembling and confused, she watches J.D. bolt into the woods.

A panicked KURT runs on the path through the woods.

VERONICA turns toward Ram's collapsed body.

<DIRECTION>
THE PATH

KURT sees the opening at the end of the woods. J.D. suddenly moves into the opening and raises his gun. KURT runs back...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CLEARING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VERONICA approaches Ram's body with increasing shivers. He does not look bleeding and unconscious. He looks bleeding and dead, dead, dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KURT barrels into the clearing as J.D. howls from the woods.
</DIRECTION>
<J_D>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now!
	</DIALOGUE>
</J_D>
<DIRECTION>
In a burst of frightened, animal instinct, VERONICA whips around and fires her gun right into KURT's chest.
</DIRECTION>

<MILNER>

	</DIALOGUE>
</MILNER>
<McCORD>

</MRS_POPE>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up, Paul. I've seen a lot of bullshit--angel dust, switchblades, sexually perverse photography exhibits involving tennis racquets, but this suicide thing....I guess it's all on Pauline's wavelength. We're just going to write off today, and Friday she can do her little little love-in or whatever. Whatever.

EXT. STUDENT PARKING LOT--MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VERONICA's car is the lone vehicle in the student parking lot. Slowly other cars begin to filter in, including a rumbling heap- ful of Heavy Metalers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE SAWYER CAR--MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Heavy Metaler Heap's obnoxious muffler causes a sleeping VERONICA's eyes to snap open in bug-eyed sweat. Mentally wounded, she climbs into the front seat, pulling on her blazer. She presses in the car cigarette lighter. J.D. rumbles from the back as more cars begin to fill the lot.
</DIRECTION>
<VERONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We killed them, didn't we?

<J_D>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course.
	</DIALOGUE>
</J_D>
<DIRECTION>
VERONICA tugs out the car lighter and savagely brands the palm of her hand. J.D. hurdles into the front seat and bats the lighter away. He lights a cigarette off the scorched flesh of VERONICA's hand as she wails away.
</DIRECTION>
<VERONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ich Luge bullets! I'm an idiot!
	</DIALOGUE>

J.D. drags on his cigarette. School buses are pulling in outside of the parking lot, in front of the school.
</DIRECTION>
<J_D>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You believed it because you wanted to believe it. Your true feelings were too gross and icky for you to face.

<DIRECTION>
J.D. launches into a rapid-fire rendition of "did-too's". VERONICA responds by holding her hands over her ears and singing "Mary had a Little Lamb." J.D.'s "Did-too's" get louder causing VERONICA to bang on the horn.

INT. THE SAWYER CAR--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
J.D. pulls VERONICA off the horn and warmly places an unlit cigarette in her mouth. As he speaks, VERONICA wearily takes the cigarette from her mouth and puts it in her blazer pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<J_D>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Football season's over, Veronica. Kurt and Ram had nothing to offer the school but date-rapes and A.I.D.S. jokes.
	</DIALOGUE>

(looking to her burnt hand)
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<MR_KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If there's any way you can hear me, Kurt buddy, I don't care that you really were some pansy. You're my flesh-and-blood. You made me proud. I love my homosexual son. My son's gay and I love him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
In dark sunglasses, VERONICA wearily leans over to J.D.
</DIRECTION>
<VERONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your son's dead and you love him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERONICA>
<J_D>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you think Mr. Kelly would react to a son with a limp wrist with a pulse?
	</DIALOGUE>
</J_D>
<DIRECTION>
They quietly laugh. VERONICA sees a LITTLE GIRL staring at her. She is wearing Kurt's football jersey and her face is soaked in tears. VERONICA's smile turns into a nauseated grimace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VERONICA'S BEDROOM FLOOR--NIGHT

	</DIALOGUE>
</VERONICA>
<DIRECTION>
VERONICA hangs up and looks to her battered diary lying against the wall. She crawls to the diary and then reaches up to her night table to pull down her monocle and a pen. She sucks a cup of Vodka and begins writing.

(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dear Diary, my teen angst bullshit now has a body count.

Sitting up against her bed, VERONICA continues writing as J.F.K. laps up Vodka from the Dixie cup.
</DIRECTION>
<VERONICA>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The most popular people in the school are dead. Everybody's sad, but it's a good kind of sad. Suicide gave Heather depth, Kurt a soul, Ram a brain. I gave J.D. shit about the Ich Luge thing but what really frightens me is that I'm not frightened by what J.D.'ll do next. It's God versus my boyfriend and God's losing....
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERONICA>
<DIRECTION>
VERONICA drops her head back and closes her eyes, popping out her monocle. She swoons down against the bed onto the floor and curls into a fetal slumber.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE CAFETERIA--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STUDENTS eat and buzz together in typical cacophony. All are wearing black armbands. A jukebox roars.

PAULINE FLEMING and an entourage of STUDENTS such as PETER DAWSON and the HEATHERS invade the cafeteria, heads raised high.
</DIRECTION>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>

As the music amusingly grinds to a halt, PAULINE hoists up a bullhorn to her lips and crackles...

<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could I have your attention?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<DIRECTION>
A startled Geek RODNEY splatters milk all over himself.

STUDENTS whip their heads around to the front of the cafeteria. MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK warily looks up from her plate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAULINE FLEMING chants with soaring self-importance.
</DIRECTION>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our school has been torn apart by tragedy. I'm here today to fuse it back together through Togetherness. I want everyone to clasp hands. We need to connect this cafeteria into one mighty circuit.

INT. THE CAFETERIA--DAY
</DIRECTION>

PAULINE's Evita Peron-like composure is crumbling.

</PAULINE>
<DIRECTION>
Her back to the viewer, VERONICA enters the cafeteria. HEATHER DUKE floats into view and tightly knots VERONICA's armband.
</DIRECTION>
<VERONICA>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I have a feeling this one'll work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER_DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
VERONICA turns to the viewer and half-gasps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO 2-person video CAMERA CREWS and a STILL PHOTOGRAPHER burst into the cafeteria slightly battering the in-the-way VERONICA.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAULINE smiles in relief. She wields around, lifting the horn.
</DIRECTION>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The cameras are here! Lock your paws!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<DIRECTION>
Slightly confused but Awesomed, a table of Country Club Kids including COURTNEY stand and latch out to each other. A nearby table with BETTY FINN and friends follow suit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VERONICA looks on with a growing sense of queasiness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Cafeteria swirls into a frenzy with members of more excitable cliques like the Jocks and the Heavy Metalers jumping over and onto tables anxiously bumbling into hand- holding constellations. CAMERA CREWS weave beside them. In a corner, the PHOTOGRAPHER snaps a shot of a thumbs-up PETER DAWSON with his arms around FEMALE STONER IN ARMY JACKET.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAULINE runs ahead of a hustling CAMERA CREW and grabs hold of a chain of hand-holding Jocks. She pulls the chain until it connects up with a grateful chain of BETTY FINNS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sleeping HEATHER MCNAMARA drearily awakens to the havoc around her. She takes off her black armband, ties it around her eyes, and droops her head back down on a table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VERONICA lets her books slide from her hands, shaking her head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARTHA DUNNSTOCK nervously looks to her out-of-control peers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HEATHER DUKE slyly looks to VERONICA with an "If you can't beat em..." smile then saunters into the fray. She slides onto the lap of Heavy Metaler Matt. The PHOTOGRAPHER snaps a shot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAULINE forces apart the handholding Heavy Metal lovers JACKIE and STEVE, sandwiches DENNIS in between them, and madly departs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The PHOTOGRAPHER now shoots a pic of a thumbs-up PETER DAWSON with his arms around an ALL OUT NERD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VERONICA stands before the chaos, back to the viewer, in much the same way Heather Chandler did in the opening scene.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAULINE and the Geek Squad look to MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK.
</DIRECTION>
<RODNEY>

	Gotcha...Could I get some Stoners over here please!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<DIRECTION>
Frightened and flustered, MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK quakes for a moment then crawls underneath her table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A last panoramic view of the hustling CAMERA CREWS amid the panderingly anarchic STUDENTS unfolds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VERONICA suddenly finds herself flanked by J.D. The exiting CAMERA CREWS flow past them.
</DIRECTION>
<J_D>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was it as good for you as it was for me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</J_D>
<DIRECTION>
A dumbfounded VERONICA watches PAULINE and PETER approach.

</PETER>

</PAULINE>
<VERONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh come on, Pauline. What happens tomorrow, when the cameras aren't here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERONICA>
<DIRECTION>
As they argue, J.D. looks out and sees MARTHA bob up from beneath her table then dart back under. He ambles away....
</DIRECTION>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are you dissing me, Veronica? I'm trying to redefine the high school experience.....
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<VERONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're ignoring the high school experience. People are dead and all you can think to do is whip up some warped Pity Party. If we're going to ever build respect for each other, it's gotta be something...something real. We can't be tricked into it. Back me up J.D...J.D.?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERONICA>
<PAULINE>

MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK'S TABLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARTHA slithers from under the table up into her seat, and head down, tries to finish off a bowl of soup. She slowly looks up and freezes. J.D. is revealed to be seated across from her, behind his Rebel Without a Cause lunch box. He smiles warmly.

INT. J.D.'S LIVING ROOM--NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VERONICA restlessly rocks on a couch with increasingly unguarded annoyance. Excitedly insensitive to her words, J.D. spins the tuner of his radio, headphones pressed to one ear.
</DIRECTION>
<VERONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That thing this afternoon...I'm so angry! It was like "Boy, isn't death fun!" "Gee, I wonder who'll die next!" "I'll bet we get four camera crews next time." It was chaos. Fucking chaos.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERONICA>
<DIRECTION>
J.D. giddily pivots around, tearing the headphones from the radio and causing a blast of static to accompany his words.
</DIRECTION>
<J_D>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you talking about? Today was great. Chaos is great. Chaos is what killed the dinosaurs, darling, and it's what's going to make Westerburg a purified place to get an education. Face it, our way is the way. We scare people into not being assholes.
	</DIALOGUE>

J.D. goes into a Sonny-Corleone-at-the-Turnpike imitation. VERONICA throws the first thing she can get her hands on, a framed picture of a woman, at the vibrating J.D.
</DIRECTION>
<VERONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm telling it to you! You! Nothing good can come from suicide, from murder, from death. Nothing! Nothing except more death and shit like that feeding frenzy this afternoon....Geez, what am I..who... Unnaah! You can be so immature!

	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</J_D>
<DIRECTION>
As the "song" kicks in (a bunch of guys shouting over a drum machine), J.D. seductively moves toward VERONICA, semi-lip- syncing it. As a seethingly angry but not unaroused VERONICA watches, J.D. slithers onto the couch.

J.D. stops his seduction and rips out a gun. He giddily fires into the radio, destroying it.

J.D. playfully tackles the fleeing VERONICA. This calms rather than angers. She turns on her back. J.D. follows suit.

VERONICA sighs, then rolls over into a crawling position and eventually into a walking-out-the-door position.

J.D. slowly sits up and with both hands, puts his gun in his mouth. He pauses, lets go of the gun, and then biting down on the barrel of the gun, J.D. proceeds to broodingly tie his shoes.

INT. EMPTY CLASSROOM--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
J.D. moves to an empty row of desks. He turns the first desk as to face the second. HEATHER DUKE warily lowers herself into the second desk as J.D. flops a manilla envelope onto it. HEATHER DUKE opens the envelope and pulls out a stack of 8x10's.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The first shot shows a YOUNG HEATHER DUKE in a summer camp uniform that vibrantly reads HEATHER, She is holding one end of a large poster board drawing of two Eskimos rubbing noses. Holding the other end, in a summer camp uniform vibrantly reading MARTHA, is a YOUNG MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK.

INT. THE GIRLS BATHROOM--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A spooked HEATHER DUKE splashes water on her face and looks up into the mirror. In a trance, she pulls her hair back Heather Chandler fashion and ties it with the ribbon J.D. gave her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BETTY FINN-A-LIKE moves up to the sink beside her. Two CHIC BABES enter the bathroom with pouting expressions. Seemingly in a trance, HEATHER DUKE bends over and wipes off her wet hands using the oblivious BETTY FINN-A-LIKE's dress. HEATHER DUKE winks to the now-giggling CHIC BABES and saunters off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HEATHER DUKE bursts through the bathroom door to wickedly strut down the hall. She scowls/smiles in perfect Heather Chandler fashion to various passers-by.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER HALLWAY--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Disoriented, VERONICA somnambulates down the hall. She suddenly brakes amid the flow of Student traffic to stare at a locker. The locker wears a POLICE LINE--DO NOT CROSS sticker. VERONICA pulls out a School Spirit Club I.D. Card and moves to the locker.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With the card, she wrangles the locker open. It contains a coat, recognizably Heather Chandler's. On the inside door is a sizable mirror, a cute little "HEATHER" license plate, an Alexander Haig For President sticker, and a picture of VERONICA and the HEATHERS all wearing sunglasses and acting tough.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VERONICA zeroes in on a three frame Photo Booth picture. In the first frame, VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER stare stonefaced. In the second frame, the two girls are screaming at the top of their lungs. In the third frame, they have returned to a stonefaced state. VERONICA touches the picture with a quivering smile as two hands flap around her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER_DUKE>

<VERONICA>

<DIRECTION>
VERONICA turns around, stunned. The Heather Chandleresque HEATHER DUKE can be seen in the locker mirror. VERONICA violently pushes HEATHER DUKE away and storms off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HEATHER DUKE peers in the open locker. A pair of red earrings flash out at her. Biting her lip, she reaches for them.

Lying on the floor, VERONICA concentrates on her phone. With a deep sigh, she pushbuttons out a number. She pauses, then...

VERONICA slams down the receiver and pulls up a sleek leather address book. She severely scans through it. Tossing it away, VERONICA then descends into the sundry junk of her night table drawer and draws up another address book. This one is frayed and pink polka-dotted. She peruses it and dials.....

BETTY FINN hits her ball through a wicket and squeals in delight. VERONICA has a motherly smile on her face.

BETTY bends down to shoot then raises her body back up.

BETTY finally shoots. Feebly.

	Ronnie!

VEONCIA gigglingly shoots, but misses the wicket. And instead hits BETTY's ball. Disturbed by the sudden dilemma, she determinedly walks to her ball and moves it away from BETTY's.
</DIRECTION>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, you're not settling for the two shots are you? Knock me out girl. It's the only way.

VERONICA sighs then knocks BETTY's adjacent ball sailing toward the porch and a statuesque Earring-wearing HEATHER DUKE, who does not budge as the ball whizzes past her.

HEATHER DUKE's shot swerves wide of the wicket.

</VERONICA>
<DIRECTION>
VERONICA blows her shot.

<HEATHER_DUKE>

HEATHER DUKE bashes her ball into VERONICA's and prepares to send it.

	Some people just don't matter. Why should those who do carry their weight? Am I right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER_DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
As HEATHER DUKE swings down her mallet, VERONICA steps on her own ball. When HEATHER DUKE's mallet makes contact, the two balls slam against each other, unmoving, with a loud smack.

<VERONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you're wrong. It's not even your turn.

As HEATHER DUKE and HEATHER MCNAMARA meander out the back of the yard, an annoyed VERONICA revolves back toward the house to see J.D. sitting comfortably at the patio table with a drink.

VERONICA reaches the patio, gently swinging her croquet mallet, excited with the thought that J.D. has come to change his ways.

Wearing a BigFun T-shirt, MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK sits in the bleachers glumly sipping out of a cup of Coke. Cheers and shouts can be heard booming around her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she places the cup down beside her, it is revealed MARTHA is completely alone in the gym; the others being sad workings of her embattled imagination.

She lifts the cup back up to her mouth but the plastic lid pops off and a gush of Coke splashes onto her BigFun T-shirt.

VERONICA stands in a corner with an "Oh brother" look on her face.

<FATHER_RIPPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	On the surface, Heather Duke was the vivacious young lady we all knew her to be. But her soul was in Antartica, freezing with the knowledge of the way fellow teenagers can be cruel, the way parents can be unresponsive, and as she writes so eloquently in her suicide note, the way life can suck. We'll all miss Sherwood's little Eskimo. Let's hope she's rubbing noses with Jesus.

VERONICA leans back in her chair, sweating. She reaches in the pocket of a blazer draped over the back of the chair and pulls out the cigarette J.D. had given her eariler in the film. She puts it in her mouth unlit then takes it out and puts it back in the blazer.

</J_D>
<DIRECTION>
J.D. throws the gun on the bed and pulls from his coat the computer printout sheet petition, then savagely rolls it out on the floor. It is filled with signatures of different sizes, styles, and colors. J.F.K. blinks.

VERONICA storms to her nearby locker. She swirls her locker combination and opens it. She glances down the hall and freezes.

In the distance, J.D. moves mechanically down the hallway carrying a large gym bag, wearing a Walkman.
</DIRECTION>

VERONICA cautiously treads down the empty hallway, trying to keep in control. Suddenly, packs of STUDENTS burst from classroom doors behind VERONICA. The excited swarms of STUDENTS move toward and past VERONICA, who has braked her troubled treading to stiffly contemplate her passing peers. She latches onto Geek RODNEY in a panic. RODNEY looks down at his clutched arm with a nervous smile.

INT. THE HALLWAY LEADING TO THE GYM--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VERONICA continues to tensely surf the tidal wave of STUDENTS heading for the gymnasium. She stops to watch her classmates file into the gym like lemmings with increasing sense of dread. She again latches onto a passing RODNEY.

J.D. walks by the firm glass windows of the boiler room, eyeing the pounding generators inside. He stops at a heavy steel door. Placing down his gym bag, J.D. proceeds to swiftly pick the lock. He swings open the steel door.

<VERONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</VERONICA>
<DIRECTION>
J.D. looks down at the gym bag already on the ground. He folds his arms and smiles. VERONICA forcefully moves closer.
</DIRECTION>
<VERONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, okay. I knew that. I knew that. Put your hands on your head.

<J_D>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Live by the sword...
	</DIALOGUE>
</J_D>
<DIRECTION>
VERONICA swings her left arm up knocking J.D.'s gun hand upward. She then sails her right fist into his face. The blow annoys him more than it hurts him but J.D.'s momentary loss of composure allows VERONICA to come in with another much harder right hook. The blow sends J.D. stumbling back against the boiler room, jarring the gun loose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They simultaneously lunge for the gun. VERONICA, having the better grip, pulls so forecfully that after wrenching the gun from J.D., she loses control of it, flinging it down the hall. VERONICA pops up to retrieve it but J.D. moves his legs scissors-style around her and trips her.

INT. GYM--THE PREP ASSEMBLY--DAY

The assembly mindlessly blares on. Cheerleader HEATHER MCNAMARA rah-rah-rahs. RODNEY and the other Geeks pass around a pair of opera glasses, all intensely scoping out the cheerleaders. A group of STONERS toke away beneath the bleachers, one of them lackadaisically leaning against a thermal bomb.

VERONICA rockets her body down and picks up the gun. J.D. grabs her and throws her against the steel boiler room door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A jostled VERONICA raises the gun. J.D. howls then bounds toward VERONICA, causing them both to careen down the steel steps of the boiler room. At the same time, he inadvertently kicks the gym bag/bomb down along with them. The gun spins from VERONICA's hand and slides away. The bomb flies out of the bag onto the boiler room floor. A digital clock on the bomb clicks on at 5:00....4:59....4:58...

The frenzied pep assembly crowd is now doing "The Wave". BETTY FINN and her similar co-horts deliriously get into the act, all sit in a circle at the bottom rows of the bleachers, pouting as STUDENTS bounce up and down around them. Jocks stand on the stage grinning and preening before the crowd.

<DIRECTION>
VERONICA and J.D. are in a heap at the bottom of the boiler room steps. VERONICA faintly works into a semi-sitting position and gives an astonished glance to the bomb, its digital clock clicking to 3:04. VERONICA crawls to the gun and levels it at a rousing-up J.D.

<J_D>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</J_D>
<DIRECTION>
Seething, VERONICA shoots up at J.D. blowing off "the finger." Shrieking in pain, J.D. drops the knife to hold this sudden geyser of blood. VERONICA achingly stands, pointing the gun. The bomb clicks down to 2:25.
</DIRECTION>
<VERONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all over, J.D. Help me to stop it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERONICA>
<J_D>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to wipe the slate clean as much as I do. Okay, so maybe I am killing everyone in the school because nobody loves me. You have a purpose though! Remember? Let's face it, the only place different social types can genuinely get along with each other is in heaven.
	</DIALOGUE>
</J_D>
<DIRECTION>
VERONICA fires the gun at J.D.'s feet. The bomb clicks to 1:49. She focuses her eyes on three red buttons on the bomb.
</DIRECTION>
<VERONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which button do I press to turn it off? Tell me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERONICA>
<J_D>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Try the red one, but seriously, people are going to look at the ashes of Westerburg and say there's a school that self-destructed not because society didn't care, but because that school was society. Is that deep or what? I'll let you put it in your diary, babe. Free of charge.
	</DIALOGUE>
</J_D>
<VERONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which red button, asshole?

<VERONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cool guys like you out of my life.

EXT. THE FRONT OF THE SCHOOL--DAY

The sound of the bomb explosion plunges the cheering up-and-down pep assembly into chaos. Wailing students pour out of the bleachers screaming less out of fear than a "Whoa Dude" sense of excitement.

EXT. THE FRONT OF THE SCHOOL--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VERONICA stands in the same position in front of the school with her arms still folded. Only now her cigarette is lit and her face and clothes are blackened in ash. Flames flicker in bushes behind her. VERONICA drags on the cigarette and turns to go inside.
