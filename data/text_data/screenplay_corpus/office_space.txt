Deeper, way down, your concerns about your job melts away. Way, way down. Now when I count backwards from three, you'll be in a state of complete relaxation. your worries, cares and ambitions will be gone. And you will remain in that state until I snap my fingers. Three.

<BOB_PORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't, don't care? PETER It's a problem of motivation, all right? Now, if I work my ass off and Initech ships a few extra units, I don't see another dime. So where's the motivation? And here's another thing, Bob. I have eight different bosses right now!

<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eight, bob. So that means when I make a mistake, I have eight different people coming by to tell me about it. That's my real motivation - is not to be hassled. That and the fear of losing my job, but y'know, Bob, it will only make someone work hard enough not to get fired.

	This sounds familiar.

	Well, so they check for this now?

</PETER>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you see, Initech's so backed up with all the software we're updating for the year 2000, they'd never notice.

<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're right. And even if they wanted to, they could never check all that code.

</PETER>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's numbers up their asses.

	<DIALOGUE>
	So, Michael, what's to keep you from doing this?

</PETER>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not worth the risk. I got a good job.

	Actually, I'm being promoted.

</PETER>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I know, Michael. It's completely unfair. And I realized something today. It's not about me and my dream of doing nothing. It's about all of us together. I don't know what happened at that hypnotherapist the other day; maybe it was just shock. It's wearing off now, but when I saw that fat man keel over and die, Michael, I realized that we don't have a lot of time on this earth. We weren't meant to spend it this way. Human beings weren't meant to sit in little cubicles, starring at computer screens all day, filling out useless forms and listening to eight different bosses drone on about mission statements.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told those fudge-packers that I like Michael Bolton's music. God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	that is not right, Michael. For five years now, you've worked your ass off at Initech, hoping for a promotion or some kind of profit sharing or something. Five years of your mid-20s now, gone. And you're gonna go in tomorrow and they're gonna throw you out into the street. You know why? So Bill Lumbergh's stock will go up a quarter of a point. Michael, let's make that stock go down. Let's take enough money from that place that we never ever have to sit in a cubicle ever again. Your software works right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course it works. That's not the point. Look, even if it could work, I don't know how to install it. I don't know the credit union software loan.

</SAMIR>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the beauty of it. Each withdrawal is a fraction of a cent. That's too small to notice. Take a thousand withdrawals a day, space it out over a few years, that's a couple hundred thousand dollars.

	Illegal? Samir, this is America! Come on, sit down! Come on! This isn't Riyadh! They're not gonna saw your hands off, all right?
