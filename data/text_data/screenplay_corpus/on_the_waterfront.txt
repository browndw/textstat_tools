EXT. ESTABLISHING SHOT-WATERFRONT-NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shooting toward a small building (Hoboken Yacht Club) set upon a wharf floating about twenty-five yards off shore. A long, narrow gangplank leads from the wharf to the shore, and on either side of the wharf are large ocean liners which are being unloaded by arc light. In the B.G. is the glittering New York skyline. A great liner, blazing with light, is headed down river. A ferry chugs across to Manhattan. There is a counterpoint of ships' whistles, some shrill, others hauntingly muted.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER SHOT-SMALL BUILDING-ON WHARF-NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is the office of the longshoremen's local for this section of waterfront. Coming along the gangplank toward the shore is an isolated figure. He is TERRY MALLOY, a wiry, jaunty, waterfront hanger-on in his late twenties. He wears a turtleneck sweater, a windbreaker and a cap. He whistles a familiar Irish song.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SERIES OF WALKING SHOTS-TERRY MALLOY-WATERFRONT-NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reaching the shore and turning away from the union office. Passing the burned-out piers. Turning up a waterfront tenement street lit by a dim street lamp that throws an eerie beam. He is holding something inside his jacket but we cannot see what it is.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
EXT. WATERFRONT STREET-NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Terry walks along until he reaches an ancient tenement where he stops, hesitates, looks up toward the top of the building, and putting his fingers to his mouth lets out a shrill, effective whistle that echoes up the quiet street. Then he cups his hands to his mouth and shouts:

MEDIUM SHOT-TENEMENT WINDOW-NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The window of a third-story room, from Terry's POV. JOEY DOYLE, a youthful, rather sensitive and clean-cut Irish boy, pokes his head out the window.
</DIRECTION>
<JOEY>

<TERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey look-
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRY>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches into his windbreaker in a gesture associated with drawing a gun from a shoulder holster. But instead he draws out a live racing pigeon. As he does so the bird makes an effort to escape and flaps its wings, but Terry subdues it expertly and holds it up for Joey to see.
</DIRECTION>

Joey closes the window and turns away.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. MEDIUM CLOSE-TENEMENT-ON TERRY -NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tensely, as if going through something he wishes he could avoid, Terry looks in the direction of the tenement stoop and nods. Now for the first time we see two men standing there under the doorway so that Joey was unable to see them from his window. When Terry nods they enter the tenement hallway; he takes a few steps forward so as to be out of sight from Joey's widow. Then Terry raises the pigeon into the air and, inexplicably, releases it. As it wings out of sight he turns and starts up the street in the direction from which he came, walking crabwise as if trying to see the effect of what he has just done. A soddenly drunk, one-armed longshoreman, MUTT MURPHY, staggers toward him, singing in a hoarse voice... .
</DIRECTION>
<MUTT>
<DIRECTION>
(as if it were a dirge)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tippi-tippi-tim, tippi-tim, Tippi-tippi-tan, tippi-tan...

	Go on, beat it!

<MUTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A dime, Terry, a dime for a cup of coffee?

	Don't give me that coffee, you rummy. Now blow!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRY>
<MUTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks for nothing, you bum.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUTT>
<DIRECTION>
With a certain battered dignity, Mutt moves off, picking up his song, "Tippi-tippi-tan, tippi-tan... ." Terry takes an anxious glance back toward the tenement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TENEMENT ROOFTOP-NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the B.G. on the far shore is the New York skyline. In the M.G. a ship is being unloaded on this side of the river. In the F.G. is a coop of racing pigeons. Joey comes out on the roof and looks around. The door f rom the tenement stairway creaks open and Joey turns.
</DIRECTION>
<JOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Terry?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEY>
<DIRECTION>
There is no answer. Joey is surprised.
</DIRECTION>
<JOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That you, Terry?
	</DIALOGUE>

Two men step out upon the roof, their faces hidden in shadows. Joey looks startled and retreats a few steps.

<DIRECTION>
LONG SHOT-ROOFTOP-NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joey turns and runs along the edge of the roof, the illuminated skyline in the B.G. He disappears from view as if he has jumped o ff the roof.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM SHOT-LOWER ROOFTOP LEVEL-NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This rooftop is one floor lower than the rooftops on either side of it, forming a trough between the two and providing no further avenue of escape for Joey. As Joey looks around desperately, Barney appears on upper level and another goon, SONNY, appears on the other. Now Joey is trapped between them. As they move forward he retreats backward toward the edge of the roof.

<JOEY>

	<DIALOGUE>
	You want me to jump so it looks like an accident?

	Come on. I'll take one of you with me.

<DIRECTION>
The goons edge in still closer, poker-faced, knowing they have him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FRIENDLY BAR-NIGHT An old-fashioned corner saloon with swinging doors. Standing on the corner, fl anked by a goon aptly named the TRUCK is CHARLEY, THE GENT, Terry's older brother, rather handsome if a little too smooth, in his late thirties, a snappy dresser in his camel hair coat and snap brim hat. He is quick-witted and affable, more politician than mobster. Terry enters to him.

Terry stares at him. Longshoremen come running out of the bar toward the sound of the scream. Terry has to struggle not to be carried along with them. He works his way toward Charley, standing on the curb with Truck, calmly watching the Friendly Bar customers excitedly running past him. (Calls and commotion in the distance O.S.)

The atmosphere is the sharpest possible contrast to the scene above. It is a rough waterfront bar full of half-gassed longshoremen and pistol boys. They are all watching a fight on TV above the bar, and there is much hoarse laughter and ad lib jokes at the fight.

As he begins to rise, tab in hand, a big longshoreman at least a head taller swings a vicious punch at him. Kayo, with old-time boxing skill, "slips" it by a fraction of an inch. The effect could be a moment of comedy relief.

FREE-FOR-ALL FAVORING POP & TERRY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pop is battling near the edge of the free-for- all, in view of Edie and Father Barry. He sees a tab on the ground and is about to pick it up when another man only slightly younger and bigger punches him in the nose. He retaliates with a looping punch that knocks his adversary back; but he is unable to scoop up the tab because meanwhile a crony of Terry's has called over.
</DIRECTION>
<JACKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Terry. Grab me on!

Terry reaches for it with one hand while blocking Pop off with his leg. He calls over to a crony.

As he hands it over to his chum, Pop comes charging in at Terry.
</DIRECTION>
<POP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, give me that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POP>
<DIRECTION>
He swings wild punches at Terry. Just then Luke, the burly Negro longshoreman, sees a tab behind Pop, hurls himself toward it, carrying Pop with him, and back into the battle royal.

Terry is enjoying himself. Unconsciously Edie is pressing herself against him to get the tab and her rage is a kind of passion that pleases him.

He runs his hand over his face and then, with a sudden impulse:
</DIRECTION>
<TERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't want to lug bananas in the rain anyway, do you, Jackie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRY>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches over and takes the tab back from Jackie.
</DIRECTION>
<JACKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aah, give it to 'im.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Terry hands the slip to Edie and adds, for the benefit of his pals:
</DIRECTION>
<TERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here you go, muscles. Nice wrastlin' with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRY>
<DIRECTION>
He flexes his forearm and throws two quick jabs at an imaginary opponent, a characteristic gesture. He sets his cap at a jaunty angle and winks at his chums but we feel his manner is forced, barely hiding his guilt. Edie looks after him with smoldering anger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns as Father Barry comes into view, leading Pop. Pop's nose is bleeding and he is pretty thoroughly battered. Nolan joins him.

INT. ENTRANCEWAY TO LOWER LEVEL-CHURCH-EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is an overflow chapel for the church above. There are stained- glass windows, an altar, pews and the figures of saints, but all is utter simplicity; it has not lost its basement feeling, and the unadorned walls and low lighting may suggest the catacombs. The above is seen from the POV of Terry as he approaches. Inside Father Barry faces a small group of longshoremen still in their work clothes, including Nolan, Moose, Tommy, and Luke; Edie sits behind them. A thin- faced, rather ascetic-looking priest, FATHER VINCENT, sits disapprovingly in the rear. As Terry stands in the rear, not anxious to enter, Father Barry is saying:
</DIRECTION>
<FATHER_BARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(rapidly, with a cigarette in his mouth)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought there'd be more of you here, but- the Romans found out what a handful could do, if it's the right handful. And the same goes for you and the mob that's got their foot on your neck. I'm just a potato-eater but isn't it simple as one - two three? One- The working conditions are bad. Two- They're bad because the mob does the hiring. Three- The only way to break the mob is to stop letting them get away with murder.

Silence. Moose looks down at the floor. Nolan works his left fist into the palm of his right hand. Tommy runs his hand over his face, embarrassed. Luke stares straight ahead of him. Terry sets his jaw stubbornly. Edie looks at all of them with a hopeful, pleading intensity. Father Barry waits, and then asks again-

	A look in his eyes! Hold your hats, brother, here we go again. You think he's one of those cases you're always draggin' in and feelin' sorry for. Like the litter of kittens you had-the only one she wants to keep has six toes and it's cockeyed to boot. Look at him. The bum! And the crush you had on that little Abyssinian... .

	He wasn't Abyssinian, Pop, Assyrian... .

<POP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Six-toed cats. Assyrians. Abyssinians. It's the same difference. Well don't think this Terry Malloy is any six-toed cockeyed Assyrian. He's a bum. Charley and Johnny Friendly owned him when he was a fighter and when they ring the bell he still goes into action.

	</DIALOGUE>
</EDIE>
<POP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See this arm? It's two inches longer 'n the other one. That's years of workin' and sweatin', liftin' and swingin' a hook. And every time I heisted a box or a coffee bag I says to myself-this is for Edie, so she can be a teacher or somethin' decent. I promised your mother. You better not let her down.

Suddenly touched, Edie goes up to Pop and kisses him.

	Pop, don't think I'm not feeling grateful for all you've done to get me an education and shelter me from this.

<DIRECTION>
(becoming aroused)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But now my eyes are open. I see things I know are so wrong how can I go back and keep my mind on things that are only in books and that people aren't living? I'm staying, Pop. And I'm going to keep on trying to find out who's guilty for Joey. I'd walk home with a dozen Terry Malloys if I thought they could help me. I tell you I'm staying, Pop. Pop starts to pull his belt out of his trousers.

EXT. TENEMENT ROOFTOP-EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Autumn on the roof. It is not particularly romantic-there are clotheslines, wooden boxes, etc. But to the people of this neighborhood it is a luxurious terrace. Terry's birds are aloft, flying in a great circle, nicely silhouetted against the sun-drenched evening sky. Jimmy Conners is with him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Terry has a long pole with which he keeps the birds circling. Moose is leaning against the wall, playing an Irish melody on his harmonica. His wife, a heavyset woman, sits beside him.

He puts down the pole and the birds start flying down toward the coop. He sees Edie approach.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I wouldn't have thought you'd be so interested -in pigeons.

</EDIE>
<TERRY>

	I go for this stuff. You know this city's full of hawks? There must be twenty thousand of 'em. They perch on top of the big hotels and swoop down on the pigeons in the park.

Perhaps a sign can emphasize Ladies' Entrance. As Terry leads Edie in, a tipsy Irish biddy is noisily protesting her enforced departure.

</BARTENDER>
<DIRECTION>
As Terry and Edie reach the bar, the radio blares a baseball game. A roar goes up from the speaker. Bartender nods to Terry. In the corner a small well-oiled longshoreman sings "I'll Take You Home Again, Kathleen" in a plaintive, cracking voice.
</DIRECTION>
<BARTENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, what do you know-Jackie just stole home.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What're you drinking?

For the first time the edge is knocked off his swagger. He feels the purity of her grief. He'd like to help-that's his immediate reaction. But there's his brother Charley and his steady work and his loyalties to the mob and its code. All this runs through his mind, confusing him, tearing him... .

He takes her hand and she walks along with him passively. The street is illuminated with colored lights and bright paper streamers. There are several gaily decorated counters serving drinks and sandwiches. There are balloons and colored paper hats. Neighbors are dancing in the street. Children look on, a few mimicking their elders f rom the sidelines. Above the street is a homemade banner inscribed: JUST MARRIED- JOHNNY AND MARY O'DAY! We catch a glimpse of the happy young bridal couple, as Terry and Edie reach the edge of the celebrants. Her eyes light up. She has passed into a dreamlike forgetfulness.

At first Edie dances somewhat clumsily and stiffly but gradually begins to dance with zest and surprising skill, as if a whole suppressed side of her nature were suddenly being released. Terry is light on his feet and they do some intricate steps together.

She laughs, out of her youth and embarrassment and unexpected enjoyment of a stolen moment.

Now Terry draws her to him and they dance a more conventional half-time foxtrot to the music.

They have danced off to a darker, less populated section of the street, away from the bar and the bandstand. Behind them people are dancing and laughing. Terry's lips brush her cheek as they dance, and move on to her mouth.

As they stare at each other in entangled hostility and love, a man turns from the food counter behind them, just finishing a hot dog and steps into Terry's path. It is Mr. Glover, the Commission investigator. In the B.G. is Gillette.

Terry looks off and then looks down, unable to speak.

	He had him killed or had something to do with it, Didn't he? He and your brother Charley?

</EDIE>

Terry drops his eyes again; he can say nothing.

You can't tell me, can you? Because you're a part of it. You're as bad as the worst of them, aren't you, Terry? Aren't you? Tell me the truth!

She runs off. Terry looks after her, pained; the subpoena weighs in his hand. He stares at it in agony, while the party swirls around him. Then the blare of an auto horn cuts through the music.

Johnny twists Terry's cheek, but not in fun this time, as he has often done before. Now it is hard enough to draw blood. Then he turns to the driver.

<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go!

The ship is being unloaded. An empty pallet is swung from the pier and lowered into the open hatch by the up-and-down-fall tackle.

	Some people think the Crucifixion only took place on Calvary. They better wise up. Taking Joey Doyle's life to stop him from testifying is a crucifixion- Dropping a sling on Kayo Nolan because he was ready to spill his guts tomorrow- that's a crucifixion. Every time the mob puts the crusher on a good man- tries to stop him from doing his duty as a citizen- it's a crucifixion.

(NOTE: I am not indicating in detail the other necessary reactions- those of Pop, Moose, the Negro Luke, the watchful hostility of Sonny and Truck, the murderous arrogance of Johnny Friendly, and the sophisticated cynicism of Charley Malloy.

	What does Christ think of the easy-money boys who do none of the work and take all of the gravy?

He makes the sign of the cross. Pop, Moose, Tommy, Luke, and the others do likewise. Big Mac and Specs, seeing the others, reluctantly follow suit. Then, disgruntled, Big Mac climbs up out of the hatch and bellows:

CLOSE-ON EDIE AND TERRY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Edie crosses herself. Then she looks at Terry. They look at each other and the feeling in both of them is some terrible hunger beyond their control. For a moment it seems as if Terry must go to her, but instead he turns away, slowly, as if this were the most diffi cult thing he was ever asked to do. Edie looks after him and we feel that she will yield to impulse and call out to him. But she looks down instead, finally, and closes her eyes, imperceptibly trembling against desire. Luke comes up to her, but she is lost in her own most private thoughts and does not see him. He carries Joey's jacket, the one Nolan has been wearing.

<TERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I keep hearing it and I don't know what to do..I don't know what to do... .

</TERRY>
<DIRECTION>
Without realizing what he is doing, he squeezes the glass in his powerful fist until it breaks. The glass cuts his hand. He draws back in pain.
</DIRECTION>
<TERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My hand.

</TERRY>
<EDIE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Edie, Edie, I...

His arms move around her. Her reaction is convulsive. Her hands move over him in anger and love.

<EDIE>

	Stay away from me

They kiss, lying across the bed, and the fever seizes them again.
</DIRECTION>
<EDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>

</EDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Then, after some moments, they are distracted by-

<VOICE_FROM_THE_STREET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Terry, come on down. I got something to show you, Terry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE_FROM_THE_STREET>

Horrified. Looking for Terry. She runs from the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE-ON FIRE ESCAPE-NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Edie runs out onto it. She looks down wildly, searching for Terry. A ship's whistle makes a mournful sound. A great luxury liner is heading out to the harbor. Fog is drifting in over the roof. She peers down but can see nothing. She hears a wild shriek from the street and runs to the railing again. It is only a teenager whooping it up below. Then she hears shots-Bang-Bang- Bang-and the sound of a police siren. She raises her hands to her head and cries.
</DIRECTION>
<EDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Terry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Then she hears the follow-up of the police siren. It is only a TV set near the open window of the floor below.
</DIRECTION>
<TV_ANNOUNCER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And now for your weekly dramatic thrill straight from the files of the City's Finest- Police Patrol... .
	</DIALOGUE>

Edie turns away in exasperation. She calls down the fire escape into the fog.
</DIRECTION>
<EDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Terry!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDIE>
<DIRECTION>
There is no answer. Mrs. Collins appears on the fire escape in her kimono.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_COLLINS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't go down!

</MRS_COLLINS>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Collins tries to restrain her but Edie wrenches away-
</DIRECTION>
<EDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>

</EDIE>
<DIRECTION>
She starts to run hysterically down the fire escape.

As Edie is coming down the outside metal steps, Mutt is wandering along singing mournfully-
</DIRECTION>
<MUTT>

	Tippi-tippi-tin, tippi-Tin... .
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUTT>
<DIRECTION>
A window opens and an angry voice cries:
</DIRECTION>
<LOUD_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drop dead!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUD_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
An old shoe is hurled at Mutt, just as Edie turns toward him.
</DIRECTION>
<MUTT>

</MUTT>
<LOUD_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>

The window bangs shut. Mutt sees Edie and turns his attention to her.
</DIRECTION>
<MUTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I seen it. I seen them put him to death! I heard him cry out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUTT>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who. Who did you see?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDIE>
<MUTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His executioners. They was stabbing him in his side. And his soft eyes was looking down at them.

(with loathing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh get away- get away!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDIE>
<DIRECTION>
She runs on. Mutt goes staggering off in the opposite direction, singing his song. Edie runs on until she sees Terry in the mist.
</DIRECTION>
<EDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Terry!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDIE>
<DIRECTION>
She runs into his arms.
</DIRECTION>
<EDIE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Terry, I'm frightened. More and more frightened.

	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(calls)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Charley?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRY>
<DIRECTION>
There is no answer. Terry frowns. Edie points through the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAME VOICE IN FOG Wanna see Charley? He's over here.
</DIRECTION>
<TERRY>

(as they hurry forward)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Charley... .
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRY>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MEDIUM CLOSE-WHITE WALL-NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The headlights of a car suddenly illuminate Charley against the wall. Charley is leaning against the lamp post, in a very casual attitude, looking as dapper as usual. Terry and Edie run to him. The car drives off .
</DIRECTION>
<TERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looking for me, Charley?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRY>
<DIRECTION>
Charley seems to study them silently. Terry nudges him.
</DIRECTION>
<TERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey Charley.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRY>
<DIRECTION>
Charley slides down the wall and crumples to the ground. Dead. Edie screams. Terry drops beside the body.
</DIRECTION>
<TERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's dead. He's dead. Those scummy, good-for-nuthin' butchers!.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRY>
<DIRECTION>
The lights of an approaching car catch them in its beam. Terry reacts quickly, cowering against the wall and pulling Edie down behind him protectively.
</DIRECTION>
<TERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Behind me. Behind me. It may be them coming back!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRY>
<DIRECTION>
They huddle in fear as the car comes closer; then it turns and the lights are no longer on them. Terry lets out a soft whistle of relief as the car drives off. Edie is completely panicked now.
</DIRECTION>
<EDIE>
<DIRECTION>
(in a horrified whisper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Terry, let's go away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Terry takes Charley's arm, which is twisted behind him, and straightens it tenderly.

<TERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Charley.

</TERRY>
<EDIE>

(hysterically)

<DIRECTION>
(stares at him, almost saying "you")
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I'm frightened- I'm frightened.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Terry seems not to hear. There are tears in his eyes but fury in his voice as he mutters to himself.
</DIRECTION>
<TERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll take it out of their skulls.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRY>

He rises, in a dangerous, animal rage.
</DIRECTION>
<EDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Terry, no, no... .
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDIE>
<TERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't hang on to me. And don't follow me. Don't follow me.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Call the Father. Ask him to take care of Charley for me. My brother. There's something I got to do.

</TERRY>
<DIRECTION>
He looks around, takes note of and strides toward-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM SHOT-PAWN SHOP-NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A little way down the block. An iron grille protects the windows. Terry goes up to the grille and looks in. Edie follows him anxiously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT-PAWN SHOP WINDOW-THROUGH GRILLE-NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There are watches, rings, fishing rods, guitars, cameras, musical instruments, suits, furs, bowler hats, and-about two feet back from the window-a .45 revolver in a holster and a belt of cartridges.
</DIRECTION>
<TERRY>
<DIRECTION>
(muttering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They put a hole in Charley. I'll put holes in them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRY>
<DIRECTION>
Edie sees what Terry is after and tries to restrain him.
</DIRECTION>
<EDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Terry, go home. There's nothing you can do now. It's locked up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Terry looks at her unseeingly, then drives the toe of his shoe through the diamond shaped opening in the grille, and through the glass behind it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PAWN SHOP WINDOW-NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shooting toward Terry, the coveted revolver in the F.G. Terry's fingers cannot quite reach it. He has to press his shoulder painfully against the jagged glass in order to inch closer to it. He contorts his face in pain as the glass cuts through his jacket into his flesh. Blood begins to dampen his shoulder but with a final effort he gets his fingers around the gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PAWN SHOP-NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Terry draws the gun from the window and slips it into his pocket, Edie sees the blood dripping from the rip in his jacket.
</DIRECTION>
<EDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Terry, you're bleeding.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDIE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want to hurt you, but... out of my way!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRY>

He flings her from him and goes on loading the gun, as she sobbingly watches him go off .
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FRIENDLY BAR-NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Terry enters. The usual crowd are present: Barney, Specs, Sonny, Truck, J.P., etc. There is a comedian on TV and everyone is laughing but the laughter dies at the sight of Terry. He goes up to the bar tensely. Everyone watches in silence. There is a suggestion of men feeling for their guns but nobody moves.
</DIRECTION>
<TERRY>
<DIRECTION>

</TERRY>
<DIRECTION>
To see for himself, Terry strides through to the back room and throws open the door. The back room is empty. Then he takes a seat at the bar so he can watch the room and the entrance. The customers eye him carefully.
</DIRECTION>
<TERRY>
<DIRECTION>

Jocko sets the drink up. He notices the jagged tear in Terry's jacket and the spreading stain of blood from the shoulder.

ANOTHER ANGLE-TOWARD ENTRANCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Footsteps are heard outside the swinging doors. Terry turns to face the entrance, his hand going to the gun in his pocket. Sonny, Truck, Barney, and others all watch him, ready for the draw. Jocko automatically crosses himself and turns off the TV, which is now only an irritant. The swinging doors open, but it's not Johnny. Just a couple of happy waterf ront barfl ies. But the moment they enter their grins vanish as they are made to feel the tension. They look at Terry, then they look at the goons watching Terry.
</DIRECTION>
<JOCKO>
<DIRECTION>
(to the newcomers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What'll you have?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOCKO>
<NEWCOMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks just the same.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEWCOMER>
<DIRECTION>
The two men bolt out the doorway. In the silence we hear the creaking of the ancient swinging doors. The silence is oppressive. Terry works his hand over his bleeding shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<JOCKO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You ought to go home and take care of that-
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOCKO>
<TERRY>
<DIRECTION>
(watching the doorway, growls)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First things first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRY>
<DIRECTION>
Once more steps are heard on the sidewalk outside the bar. Once more everyone is on edge for the showdown between Terry and Johnny. All eyes are on the swinging doors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM CLOSE-SWINGING DOORS-NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Father Barry enters, followed by Moose, Tommy, Luke. CAMERA goes with Father Barry as he walks right up to Terry.

<TERRY>
<DIRECTION>
(just a trifle disconcerted)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You go to-
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRY>
<DIRECTION>
Father Barry throws a good right hand punch that catches Terry by surprise and knocks him down. Terry rises, feeling his shoulder, which is oozing blood now and weakening him. He charges Father Barry like a tormented animal.
</DIRECTION>
<TERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why you... .
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRY>
<DIRECTION>
Moose and Luke grab him, although Father Barry waits calmly.

<TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(to Terry)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get wise to yourself, you bum.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>

The word hits him. Terry drops his hands slowly, weaving as if weak from loss of blood.
</DIRECTION>
<TERRY>

<FATHER_BARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(to Terry)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A bum. Look what you're doing. You want to be brave? Firing lead into another man's flesh isn't brave. Any bum who picks up a .45 in a pawn shop can be that brave. You want to hurt Johnny Friendly? You want to fix him for what he did to Charley- and a dozen men who were better than Charley? Don't fight him like a hoodlum down here in the jungle. That's just what he wants. He'll hit you in the head and plead self-defense. Fight him tomorrow in the courtroom- with the truth as you know it- Truth is the gun- Drop that thing and tell the truth- a more dangerous weapon than this little -

</FATHER_BARRY>
<DIRECTION>
The two men look at each other. Father Barry's words cut him.
</DIRECTION>
<FATHER_BARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That is, if you've got the guts. If you haven't, you better hang on to this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER_BARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Father Barry offers the gun back to Terry contemptuously. Terry takes the gun, and holds it self-consciously.
</DIRECTION>
<FATHER_BARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want a beer?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Jocko)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two beers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER_BARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Jocko sets them up and Father Barry and Terry drink them off, looking at each other. The drink seems to refresh Terry. He turns around to Jocko and slams the gun down on the bar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind the bar is a large picture, in the place of honor, showing Johnny Friendly arm-in-arm with "Mr. Upstairs," beaming with self- confidence.
</DIRECTION>
<TERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Father, there is one thing I'd like to do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRY>
<DIRECTION>
So saying, he takes his revolver and hurls it into the face of the picture.

<TERRY>
<DIRECTION>
(feeling better)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell Johnny I was here.

His face a bloody mask, being punched and kicked until he finally goes down. Goons are ready to finish the job when a battered Johnny Friendly mutters:
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's enough. Let 'im lay there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNNY>
<DIRECTION>
Terry is crumpled on the deck, senseless, in a pool of blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE-ON EDIE AND FATHER BARRY

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me by.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDIE>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO TERRY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blood seeping from his many wounds as Father Barry and Edie run in and kneel at his side. Johnny Friendly near by.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want 'im?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as he goes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

</FATHER_BARRY>
<EDIE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</EDIE>
<FATHER_BARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Terry... Terry... .
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER_BARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Terry groans, barely conscious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ENTRANCE TO PIER-ON BOSS STEVEDORE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In felt hat and business suit, symbols of executive authority.
</DIRECTION>
<BOSS_STEVEDORE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's in charge here? We gotta get this ship going. It's costing us money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOSS_STEVEDORE>
<DIRECTION>
The longshoremen hang back, glancing off toward the fallen Terry.
</DIRECTION>
<BOSS_STEVEDORE>
<DIRECTION>
(waving them towardhim)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on! Let's get goin'!

<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Others around him murmur agreement.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNNY>
<DIRECTION>
(from B.G.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Work! He can't even walk!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNNY>
<DIRECTION>
JOHNNY ON RAMP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Surrounded by longshoremen ignoring Stevedore's command, tries to drive them on.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on! Get in there!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(grabbing Pop and shoving him forward)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNNY>
<DIRECTION>
From force of habit, Pop begins to comply. Then he catches himself and turns on Johnny.
</DIRECTION>
<POP>
<DIRECTION>
(sounding more sad than angry)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All my life you pushed me around.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POP>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly he shoves Johnny off the ramp into the water scummy with oil slick and riverbank debris.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOHNNY IN WATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cursing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POP AND LONGSHOREMEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cheering Johnny Friendly's humiliation.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNNY>
<DIRECTION>
(from water)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, get me outa here.
	</DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</MOOSE>
<DIRECTION>
Others facing Stevedore mutter agreement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TERRY,FATHER BARRY AND EDIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Terry's eyes flutter as they bathe his wounds.
</DIRECTION>
<EDIE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Father Barry)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're waiting for him to walk in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDIE>
<FATHER_BARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You hear that, Terry?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as Terry fails to respond)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Terry, did you hear that?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(trying to penetrate Terry's batteredmind)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You lost the battle but you have a chance to win the war. All you gotta do is walk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER_BARRY>
<TERRY>
<DIRECTION>
(slowly coming to)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...walk?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRY>
<FATHER_BARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Johnny Friendly is layin' odds that you won't get up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER_BARRY>
<JOHNNY>
<DIRECTION>
(in B.G., shouts)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, you guys!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNNY>
<DIRECTION>
Friendly's voice acts as a prod on Terry.
</DIRECTION>
<TERRY>
<DIRECTION>
(dazed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get me on my feet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRY>
<DIRECTION>
They make an effort to pick him up. He can barely stand. He looks around unseeingly.
</DIRECTION>
<TERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Am I on my feet...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRY>
<EDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Terry...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDIE>
<FATHER_BARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're on your feet. You can finish what you started.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER_BARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Blood oozing from his wounds, Terry sways, uncomprehendingly.
</DIRECTION>
<FATHER_BARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER_BARRY>
<TERRY>
<DIRECTION>
(mutters through bloody lips)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can? Okay. Okay...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRY>
<EDIE>
<DIRECTION>
(screams at Father Barry)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you trying to do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDIE>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE-ON RAMP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the groggy Terry starts up the ramp, Edie reaches out to him. Father Barry holds her back.
</DIRECTION>
<FATHER_BARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leave him alone. Take your hands off him- Leave him alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER_BARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Staggering, moving painfully forward, Terry starts up the ramp. Edie's instinct is to help him but Father Barry, knowing the stakes of this symbolic act, holds her back. Terry stumbles, but steadies himself and moves forward as if driven on by Father Barry's will.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TERRY APPROACHING PIER ENTRANCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he staggers forward as if blinded, the longshoremen form a line on either side of him, awed by his courage, waiting to see if he'll make it. Terry keeps going.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE ANGLE-BOSS STEVEDORE-TERRY'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Waiting at pier entrance as Terry approaches. Shot out of focus as Terry would see him through bloody haze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TERRY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the men who have formed a path for him watch intently, Terry staggers up until he is face to face with the Stevedore. He gathers himself as if to say, "I'm ready. Let's go."
</DIRECTION>
<STEVEDORE>
<DIRECTION>
(calls officially)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right- let's go to work!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVEDORE>
<DIRECTION>
As Terry goes past him into the pier, the men with a sense of inevitability fall in behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOHNNY FRIENDLY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hurrying forward in a last desperate effort to stop the men from following Terry in.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNNY>
<DIRECTION>
(screams)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where you guys goin'? Wait a minute!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNNY>
<DIRECTION>
As they stream past him.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be back! I'll be back! And I'll remember every last one of ya!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNNY>
<DIRECTION>
He points at them accusingly. But they keep following Terry into the pier.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER ANGLE-PIER ENTRANCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Father Barry and Edie look on, Stevedore blows his whistle for work to begin. Longshoremen by the hundreds march into the pier behind Terry like a conquering army. In the B.G. a frenzied Johnny Friendly is still screaming, "I'll be back! I'll be back!" The threat, real as it is, is lost in the forward progress of Terry and the ragtail army of dock workers he now leads.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
