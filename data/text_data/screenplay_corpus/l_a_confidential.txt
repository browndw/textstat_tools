OVER the opening strains of "I LOVE YOU, CALIFORNIA," a MONTAGE: a mixture of headlines, newsreel footage and live action. Economy Booming! Postwar Optimism! L.A.: City of the Future! But most prominent among them: GANGLAND! Police photographers document crime scenes. The meat wagon hauls ex-button men to the morgue. Where will it end?

EXT. L.A. SKYLINE - SUNSET

Palm trees in silhouette against a cherry sky. City lights twinkle. Los Angeles. A place where anything is possible. A place where dreams come true. As the sky darkens, triple-kleig lights begin to sweep back and forth.

INT. HANCOCK PARK MANSION - BALLROOM - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
The MAYOR yanks a cloth to reveal a MODEL of L.A. criss- crossed by an elaborate FREEWAY SYSTEM. The CROWD oohs. A COUNCILMAN claps. A SOCIETY MATRON nods her approval.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PIERCE PATCHETT, 50, tuxedoed, watches off to one side. A behind-the-scenes power broker, Patchett exudes authority much more so than the Mayor does.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYOR>
	<DIALOGUE>

INT. THE MOCAMBO - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CLUB PHOTOGRAPHER pops snapshots, but the real action is on the floor where MICKEY COHEN does a wicked "Lindy Hop" with THREE different GIRLS at once. A fireplug of a man, he hardly seems a public menace. Nearby is his bodyguard JOHNNY STOMPANATO. Over it all:

	<DIALOGUE>
	Meyer Harris Cohen, Mickey C to his fans. He's the big moocher, local L.A. color to the nth degree. You know Mickey. He runs dope, rackets and prostitution. He kills a dozen people a year. But who you may not know is bodyguard Johnny Stompanato.

His hair in a slick pompadour, Stompanato keeps an eye on Cohen and comes onto a CIGARETTE GIRL at the same time.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Johnny's handsome, ladies, but the real attraction is below the belt. Second only to Steve Cochran, he's sometimes known as 'Oscar' because of his Academy Award-size appendage.

Mickey works a sweat on the dance floor. A bottle of champagne pops; Stompanato reacts, nearly draws a pistol from his shoulder holster. As he laughs at himself...

INT. PACKARD (ACROSS FROM BULLOCKS WILSHIRE) - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
December 24th. Wendell "BUD" WHITE, 30, stares at the enormous Christmas tree on the deco platform over Bullocks' entrance. An LAPD cop, Bud's rep as the toughest man on the force has been well earned. In the back seat, with cases of Walker Black and Cutty Sark, is Bud's partner -- DICK STENSLAND. Older, but also a tough hump, "Stens" sucks on a pint of Old Crow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The passenger door opens and Mickey Cohen bodyguard Johnny Stompanato slides in. Guinea handsome, Johnny wears his curls in a tight pompadour. With his boss behind bars, he's out of work. Bud just stares at him.
</DIRECTION>

	</DIALOGUE>
</STENSLAND>
<STOMPANATO>

</STOMPANATO>
<DIRECTION>
Impatient, Bud tugs at a finger, CRACKS a KNUCKLE.
</DIRECTION>
<STOMPANATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's this guy. He's blond and fat, about forty. Likes the ponies. Been pimping his wife to cover his losses. Knocks her around to keep her in line.

Bud's eyes narrow at this last bit of info. Stompanato holds up a slip of paper.

<STOMPANATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I figure the address is worth twenty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STOMPANATO>
<DIRECTION>
Bud digs into his wallet, pulls out twenty bucks, exchanges it with Stompanato. Stompanato smiles smugly, grabs a bottle of Scotch from the back.
</DIRECTION>
<STOMPANATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yuletide cheer, fellas.

<DIRECTION>
The Packard pulls up out front. Stensland could care less.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud pounces. Fat guy takes a swing, misses. Grabbing fat guy's hair, Bud smashes his face to the pavement. Once, twice. Teeth skitter down the walk.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Touch her again and I'll know about it. Understand? Huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
Another face full of gravel. Fat guy's WIFE watches with apprehension from the steps as Bud cuffs her husband's hands behind his back, empties his pockets. A cash roll and car keys. Bud looks over at her.

<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got someplace you can go?

Her hair kerchiefed, Lynn waits as the Owner writes it up. There's glamour, a cat-girl grace about Lynn. She seems like she belongs up on the wall with the movie stars. Lynn looks across as Bud White heads toward the counter. Spotting her, Bud doesn't look so tough for a moment.

Bud starts over. The case on his hip, he motions for her to roll down the window. The driver's side door opens and bodyguard TURNER "BUZZ" MEEKS menaces his way out.

<MEEKS>

Beside her, a man leans over. Pierce Patchett, seen before at the freeway unveiling, is a man used to being chauffeured. Like FDR, he smokes his cigarette in a holder.

	Dudley, I came up with a title for the story. I'm calling it "Silent Night with the L.A.P.D."

<DUDLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excellent. How's this?

	<DIALOGUE>
	The sanctity of the night is an invitation to the darker criminal element. Our vigilance will not be diminished.

As the Reporter scribbles down the quote...

<DUDLEY>

They laugh. Dudley points the way out.

<DUDLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This way, gentlemen.

Dudley's the last one out the door. As he goes, he turns back to give the men a wink. He's no sooner out the door when the first case of Johnny Walker is brought in.

INT. PRECINCT HOUSE - DISPATCH DESK - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Ed Exley gets another report from the Young Officer.

<YOUNG_OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two police officers were assaulted in a bar. Brown and Helenowski.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
He hands the report to Exley. It's now that Dudley comes through on his press junket.
</DIRECTION>
<DUDLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is Sergeant Ed Exley. Son of the legendary Preston Exley. He's the watch commander tonight and a damn fine job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUDLEY>
<DIRECTION>
As the photographer snaps Exley's picture...
</DIRECTION>
<DUDLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was fortunate enough to be partnered with his father when I was a rookie. It makes a man feel old. That's a fact.

	Feel free to get a feel for the place.

INT. DUDLEY SMITH'S OFFICE - DAY

Dudley pours two drinks, hands one to Exley.
</DIRECTION>
<DUDLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To the memory of your father.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUDLEY>
<DIRECTION>
They drink. Exley looks to a photo on the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Himself as a ten-year-old standing between Dudley and his father Preston, both in police uniform.
</DIRECTION>
<DUDLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The day he got the Medal of Valor. A simpler time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUDLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Remembering, Exley invokes his father's favorite toast.
</DIRECTION>
<EXLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To the solving of crimes that require absolute justice.

Exley raises his glass, but Dudley just watches him.

<DUDLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was his favorite toast.

</EXLEY>
<DUDLEY>

	You'll make lieutenant inside a year. Patrol division?

<EXLEY>

	I was thinking Detective Bureau.

</EXLEY>
<DIRECTION>
We can see Dudley doesn't approve.
</DIRECTION>
<DUDLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't have the eye for human weakness to be a good detective. Or the stomach. You're a political animal, Edmund.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUDLEY>
<DIRECTION>
The criticism stings, but Dudley's a straight shooter.
</DIRECTION>
<EXLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're wrong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXLEY>
<DUDLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Am I...? Would you be willing to plant corroborative evidence on a suspect you knew was guilty in order to ensure an indictment?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUDLEY>
<EXLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dudley, we've been over this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXLEY>
<DUDLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Answer yes or no.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUDLEY>
<EXLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I... No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXLEY>
<DUDLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis...? Yes or no, Edmund.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUDLEY>
<EXLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXLEY>
<DUDLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you be willing to beat confessions out of suspects you knew to be guilty?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUDLEY>
<EXLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXLEY>
<DUDLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you be willing to shoot hardened criminals in the back to offset the chance --
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUDLEY>
<EXLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXLEY>
<DUDLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then for God's sake, don't be a detective. Stick to assignments where you won't have to make those choices. Patrol, Internal Affairs, but not the Bureau.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUDLEY>
<EXLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know you mean well, Dudley, but I don't need to do it the way you did. Or my father.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXLEY>
<DUDLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At least get rid of the glasses. I can't think of one Bureau man who wears them.

Jack Vincennes at his desk. Holding the Fleur-de-Lis card, Jack dials the number. A corkboard on the wall is posted with press clippings. "Dope Crusader Wounded in Shootout." "Actor Mitchum Seized in Marijuana Shack Raid." That one includes a shot of Jack ushering Mitchum into jail.

<EXLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, men. You've had your fun. Time to break it up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXLEY>
<DIRECTION>
The party continues undiminished. From across the room, Stensland eyes Exley with disdain.
</DIRECTION>
<STENSLAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fucking Exley. Guy's got a pole so far up his ass, every time he farts the flag waves.

<DIRECTION>
WATCH COMMANDER'S OFFICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The command not really his, Exley reads a report, ignores the party, though his window looks into the thick of it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly a ripple goes through the room. The men begin to push out through a rear door. Exley stands, stops a COP.
</DIRECTION>
<EXLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's going on?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXLEY>
<COP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They got the spics who japped Helenowski and Brown. Helenowski lost an eye and Brown's got brain damage.

</COP>
<EXLEY>

Exley starts out after them.

INT. CELL BLOCK - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Stensland in the lead. Pulling out a blackjack, he enters Cell #4, begins wailing on one of the Mexicans -- Dinardo.
</DIRECTION>
<STENSLAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For ours, Pancho. And you're getting off easy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STENSLAND>
<DIRECTION>
Cheered on by drunks in the tank and his fellow officers, Stensland goes wild. He's joined by Lentz, Crumley and Tristano. Shaking his head, Jack Vincennes moves away.

INT. SQUAD ROOM - NIGHT

Bud types his report with one finger. Jack looks in.

INT. CELL BLOCK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Followed by Jack, Bud forces his way through the crowd. The men who see it's him quickly clear a path.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Swigging from a pint of gin, Stensland works skinny GARCIA. Head saps. The kid drops to his knees drooling blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud grabs Stensland, hauls him off of Garcia who looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<GARCIA>

	Fuck you, pendejo.

Bud sees red. Letting go of Stensland, Bud White picks up Garcia by the neck. There are cheers, "Attaboys" and "Holy Fucks" as Bud bangs Garcia's head on the ceiling.

<EXLEY>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop, Officer! That's an order!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Cops block Exley's way. As Bud looks over, Garcia kicks him in the balls. A dangling shot. Bud keels into the bars, Garcia stumbles out of the cell, smack into Jack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack looks down aghast at blood on his cashmere blazer, then puts Garcia down with a left-right.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Exley pulls a pad of paper and pen form his pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<EXLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're going in my report! All of you!

Exley has just started taking names when Bud grabs him by the scruff of the neck and hauls him off balance into...
</DIRECTION>

As Exley struggles, a cop opens the door to the store room. Bud slings Exley inside, then slams the door tight. Exley is locked in. As Bud moves off, we hear POUNDING.

INT. CHIEF'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CHIEF sits behind a desk in a four-star uniform. Dudley Smith sits to his left, D.A. Ellis Loew to his right. Seen earlier at the Mickey Cohen press conference, Loew is the only civilian. Bud White stands across from them. There to be judged.
</DIRECTION>
<CHIEF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Officer White, you've refused to cooperate with Internal Affairs. But you should know this is bigger than a police board. Indictments may be handed down. Quite frankly, we need police witnesses to offset the damage done to the Department's image. Will you testify?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHIEF>
<DIRECTION>
Bud glances to a gray tinted mirror, then to the Chief.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, sir. I won't.

</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
The Chief sighs, looks to Loew.
</DIRECTION>
<CHIEF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	District Attorney Loew.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHIEF>
<DIRECTION>
Loew steps to Bud, holds up a newspaper with the cell block photo. The headline: "BLOODY CHRISTMAS."
</DIRECTION>
<LOEW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bloody Christmas. The press love to label. You and Officer Stensland brought the liquor into the precinct. Stensland was already drunk. Do you see how appearing as a voluntary witness against him could offset the damage you've done to yourself?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOEW>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I won't do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(staring at mirror)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I won't testify against my partner or anyone else.

</BUD>
<LOEW>

	This man is a disgrace.

	This is the new L.A.P.D., White. You're suspended from duty and dismissed.

Turning, White shoots the mirror a stiff middle finger as he makes his way out. Dudley Smith hides a smile.

Exley watches, involuntarily leans back as Bud passes on the other side of the glass.

THE CHIEF'S OFFICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dudley, Loew and The Chief wait as Exley enters.
</DIRECTION>
<CHIEF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ed, your observations have been astute. What's your assessment of this situation?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHIEF>
<EXLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The public demands justice, sir. This was a full-fledged riot of policemen. Shift the guilt to men whose pensions are secured. Force them to retire. But someone has to swing. Indict, try and convict Stensland and Bud White. Secure them jail time. Feed them to the sharks, sir. Protect yourself; protect the department.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Dudley gives Exley a look. He's angry with him.
</DIRECTION>
<DUDLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stensland's a disgrace. Straight D fitness reports from every C.O. he ever served under. But White is a valuable officer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUDLEY>
<EXLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	White's a mindless thug.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXLEY>
<DUDLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Edmund. He's a man who can answer yes to those questions I ask you from time to time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUDLEY>
<DIRECTION>
The Chief interrupts with his own concern.
</DIRECTION>
<CHIEF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to know who we give the public in contrast? The department needs role models. Clean-cut, forthright men the public can admire.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHIEF>
<EXLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll testify, sir. I'm not afraid to do what's right.

</EXLEY>
<CHIEF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I'll promote you. You'll be a lieutenant immediately.

Exley seizes the moment, going over Dudley's head.

<EXLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Detective lieutenant.

</EXLEY>
<DIRECTION>
The Chief and Dudley exchange a look. Neither approves.
</DIRECTION>
<CHIEF>

	Ed, you're 30. Your father didn't make lieutenant until he was 33.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHIEF>
<EXLEY>

	I know that, sir. I also know that when he made lieutenant, it was as a detective.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXLEY>
<LOEW>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Before we start polishing our laurels, it would look better if we had a corroborative witness.

</LOEW>
<DUDLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That'll be hard to come by. The men hate a turncoat.
	</DIALOGUE>

As Exley starts out, Dudley pulls him aside, speaks low.

Round two. Centred on Jack. Exley is gone.

	<DIALOGUE>
	What do I have to do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<LOEW>

</EXLEY>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're playing an angle, college boy. You're getting something out of this so you don't have to hobnob with the fucking rank and file cops who'll hate your guts for snitching. If they're making you a detective, watch out. Some Bureau guys are gonna burn in this and you're gonna have to work with friends of theirs.

	What about you?

Dudley sits at a table. A newspaper is opened, a little mound underneath. Bud joins Dudley.

<DUDLEY>

	Lad, I admire your refusal to testify and your loyalty to your partner. I admire you as a policeman, particularly your adherence to violence as a necessary adjutant to the job. And I am most impressed with your punishment of wife beaters. Do you hate them, Wendell?

It's very bad timing as Exley enters, comes face-to-face with them. This is hatred.

Acting on impulse, Bud goes after Exley. It's a mauling. Four vicious body shots. A potentially lethal head shot sails wide as Exley falls to the ground.

Bare. A table and chair bolted to the floor. A tough FLAT-NOSED GANGSTER is cuffed to the hot seat. On the table are a .45 and a fat roll of $100 bills.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Breuning and Carlisle watch as Bud White delivers a couple of short, stiff body shots. Flatnose is not used to being on the receiving end. All the same, we get the idea Bud's a bit reluctant.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud's back is to Dudley and Exley who enter behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DUDLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come, Wendell, you can do better than that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUDLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Bud turns, sees Exley and Dudley. A beat. As Bud looms over Flatnose, the gangster babbles. Snitch-frenzied.
</DIRECTION>
<FLATNOSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know things. I hear things. Like with the Mick inside, things are on this weird slowdown. These shooter teams, bang bang bang, they're 86-ing Mickey Cohen's men.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLATNOSE>
<DUDLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We know all that, lad. Tell us, who do these shooters work for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUDLEY>
<FLATNOSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. No one knows. Maybe they're mavericks. You want a prostie roust? Huh? Some narco action?

	Uncuff him, Michael.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUDLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Dudley turns to Exley.
</DIRECTION>
<DUDLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Sifakis is a known loan shark from San Francisco. He arrived this afternoon at Union Station. Looking for business opportunities in our fair city. An organized crime associate in need of re- education in the ways of polite society.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUDLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Uncuffed, Flatnose rubs his wrists. Wary. As Breuning steps back, Flatnose snatches the .45 off the table.
</DIRECTION>
<FLATNOSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Motherfuckers!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLATNOSE>
<DIRECTION>
Exley dives for cover, but the other four cops just stand there. Dudley looks down on the floor at Exley.
</DIRECTION>
<DUDLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's part of the play, Edmund. A sincerity test.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUDLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Flatnose looks at the gun a beat, then squeezes the TRIGGER. CLICK CLICK. No bullets.
</DIRECTION>
<DUDLEY>
<DIRECTION>
(to Breuning)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sit him back down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUDLEY>
<DIRECTION>
CLICK, CLICK. They shove Flatnose back in the hot seat. Dudley offers a hand to Exley, helps him to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DUDLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wendell, you need to accompany Detective Lieutenant Exley on official police business. I'll finish up here.

INT. COUNTY MORGUE - HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Exley and Bud walk. An orderly wheels a covered corpse toward them from the other end of the hall. Bud's spooked. The orderly wheels the body in to the examination room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Bud and Exley pass, the CORONER pulls back the sheet, is surprised at the sight of a woman who we don't quite see.
</DIRECTION>
<CORONER>

	Call me crazy, but for a second I thought it was Rita Hayworth.

MORGUE MEAT LOCKER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Exley and Bud walk past a wall of drawers to where a coroner's assistant waits.
</DIRECTION>
<EXLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We need you to I.D. the body. There's no next of kin and you knew him best. So tell me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXLEY>
<DIRECTION>
The assistant pulls open drawer 12. A naked man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A tag on his toe and half his face blown off.
</DIRECTION>
<EXLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that Dick Stensland?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Stunned, Bud stares at what's left of his old partner.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, that's Stens.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<EXLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hell of a way to avoid a prison sentence.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Bud's torn between wanting to smash Exley and finding out why Stensland is dead. He squeezes out the words.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<EXLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Someone held up a coffee shop, panicked and killed six people.

INT. COUNTY MORGUE - EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HILDA LEFFERTS, 50, enters with the coroner to ID the body of her daughter, Susan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's stray buckshot in the upper chest and shoulders, but a sheet hides the real damage. It's the girl Bud saw outside Hollywood Liquor. Without the black eyes, she does look like Rita hayworth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Bud and Exley appear, Mrs. Lefferts looks confused.
</DIRECTION>
<CORONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this your daughter, Mrs. Lefferts?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORONER>
<MRS_LEFFERTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I -- I don't know.

Exley doesn't realize, but Bud recognizes the deceased.

<MRS_LEFFERTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It seems like my Susan, but...

</MRS_LEFFERTS>
<EXLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When was the last time you saw her, Mrs. Lefferts?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXLEY>
<MRS_LEFFERTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At Christmas. We had fought. I didn't like her boyfriend. I -- she has a birthmark on her hip.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_LEFFERTS>

The Coroner lifts the sheet. Mrs. Lefferts gasps.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_LEFFERTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's her. My baby. Dear God...

The room buzzes, jammed to the rafters with every detective standing ready. The Chief waits as Dudley Smith takes the mike, holds up an L.A. Times headline.
</DIRECTION>
<DUDLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Nite Owl Massacre.' Hyperbole aside, this is a heinous crime that requires a swift resolution. The public will demand it and this department will provide it. Six victims. One of them, one of our own -- Dick Stensland.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as the cops react)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As it happens, he was a Nite Owl regular. In the wrong place at the wrong time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUDLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Bud White listens, not too sure. Stensland said he had something big going on...
</DIRECTION>
<DUDLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Robbery looks like the motive. We have rubber glove prints on the register and preliminary forensics strongly lean toward a trio of gunmen. We do have one hot lead, so listen well. Three Negro youths were seen last night discharging shotguns in the air at Griffith Park. A park ranger I.D.ed them as driving a 1948 to 1950 Mercury Coupe, purple in color. An hour ago, a canvassing crew found a news vendor who saw a purple Merc Coupe parked across from the Nite Owl around 3:00 A.M.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUDLEY>
<DIRECTION>
The room goes loud, a big rumbling. Dudley holds up a list.
</DIRECTION>
<DUDLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The D.M.V. worked all night to get us a registration list on '48 to '50 purple Mercs. There are 142 registered to Negroes in L.A. County. Fifty two-man teams will shake three names apiece. Hot suspects you'll bring here. Interrogation rooms have been set up. They'll be run by Lieutenant Edmund Exley. Hollywood Squad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUDLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Catcalls. Boos. The Chief steps to the mike.

<CHIEF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Enough on that. Gentlemen, just go out and get them. Use all necessary force. The people of Los Angeles demand it.

</CHIEF>

The men exchange knowing looks. The real message: kill them clean. Exley doesn't approve. As the men hurry out...

A big, pink Spanish mansion with lots of tile. Also last seen outside Hollywood Liquor on Christmas Eve, Pierce Patchett is in the front yard, chipping golf balls over a koi pond. They land in a tight grouping. As he tees up:

<BUD>

(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must slay 'em at the country club.

Bud's halfway up the walk. Patchett sees the cuffs hooked to his belt. Patchett is cool as can be.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you Pierce Patchett?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<PATCHETT>

</BUD>
<PATCHETT>

	Do you care about criminal matters peripheral to Susan's murder?

	That's right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<PATCHETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then listen closely, because I'll only say this once and if it gets repeated, I'll deny it. I run call girls. Lynn Bracken is one of them and so was Susan Lefferts. I treat my girls very well. I have grown daughters, myself, and I don't like the thought of women being hurt. I sense you share this feeling.

<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you ever heard of Dick Stensland?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<LYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No I haven't. Do you know why Pierce is humoring you?

</LYNN>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You use words like that, you might make me mad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<LYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. But do you know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYNN>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah I know. Patchett's running whores and judging by his address, probably something bigger on the side. He doesn't want any attention.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<LYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right. Our motives are selfish, so we're cooperating.

<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why was Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl?

<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did Lefferts have a boyfriend?

</BUD>
<LYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like I said we were friendly, not friends.

</LYNN>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How'd she meet Patchett?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<LYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pierce meets people. Sue came on the bus with dreams of Hollywood. This is how they turned out. Thanks to Pierce, we still get to act a little.

</LYNN>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me about Patchett.

Lynn smiles again. She likes Bud. A beat.

</LYNN>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe I'm just fucking curious.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<LYNN>

</LYNN>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You fuck for money.

</BUD>
<LYNN>

</BUD>
<LYNN>
<DIRECTION>
(laughs again)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, it was two. You're different, Officer White. You're the first man in five years who didn't tell me I look like Veronica Lake inside of a minute.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYNN>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You look better than Veronica Lake. Now, Pierce Patchett.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<LYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He takes a cut of our earnings and invests it for us. He makes us quit the life at thirty. He doesn't let us use narcotics and he doesn't abuse us. Can your policeman's mentality grasp those contradictions?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYNN>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He had you cut to look like Veronica Lake?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<LYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I'm really a brunette, but the rest is me. And that's all the news that's fit to print.

Lynn starts toward the door. Bud watches her a moment, then follows. She takes his glass at the door.
</DIRECTION>
<LYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was nice meeting you, Officer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYNN>

Out the door, Bud turns back. Blurts:

	Look. I want to see you again.

Lynn watches thoughtfully after Bud as he walks away. He opens his car door like he's going to tear ir off. A last glance back at Lynn and as he gets in the car...

EXT. TEVERE HOTEL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An L-shaped walk-up. Jack coasts the car to the curb. He leaps out with Exley. Exley holds up at the sight of a late model sedan. He leans down to look in the window at the two-way on the dash.

CARPORT

Toting shotguns, Dudley's boys from the Victory Motel, Breuning and Carlisle, stand by the purple Mercury. Jack and Exley come around the corner, lower their guns.

Breuning wheels, pumps a round into the chamber. He very nearly fires before he sees who it is.

Fontaine freezes. Jones doesn't dare get up.

Jack and Exley burst into a...

INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dudley watches intently as Ed Exley skims a report, memorizing names and dates. Jack and other brass are also here along with a stenographer. So's Bud. One of these guys killed Stensland. Through tinted glass, the three suspects in three different rooms.

<EXLEY>

	Casitas Youth Camp... Coates twenty-two, a boxer... Manager saw them burning clothes.

Exley closes the door. Ray Coates is cuffed to a chair, dressed in baggy County denims. One eye swollen shut, lip split, a smashed nose with one nostril split.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Exley unlocks his cuffs. drops cigarettes and amtches on the table. As Coates rubs his wrists...
</DIRECTION>
<EXLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They call you Sugar Ray because of Ray Robinson?

</EXLEY>

No bite. Coates just stares back.
</DIRECTION>
<EXLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You look like Robinson after that last LaMotta fight. 'Course LaMotta looked a lot worse. So you're twenty-two, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXLEY>
<COATES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Man, why do you keep asking me that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COATES>
<EXLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just getting my facts straight. Twenty-two makes it a gas chamber bounce. You should have pulled this caper a couple of years ago. Get life, do a little Youth Authority jolt, transfer to Folsom a big man. Orbit on some of that good prison brew, get yourself a sissy --
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXLEY>
<COATES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never truck with no sissies!

	Man, why're you talkin' about Larry? His business is his business.

<DIRECTION>
Unseen by Coates, Exley reaches under the table, takes hold of one of three toggle switches.
</DIRECTION>
<EXLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sugar, Larry told me you went sissy up at Casitas. You couldn't do the time so you found yourself a big white boy to look after you. He said they call you 'Sugar' because you gave it out so sweet.

Exley flips the toggle.

BEDROOM

A NUDE GIRL spread-eagled on a mattress. Bound with neckties. One in her mouth. Her eyes grow wide at the sight of Bud, then flicker to the adjoining room. Directing him. Raising the .38, Bud enters...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE KITCHEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sylvester Fitch sits naked at the table wolfing Rice Krispies and watching "Badge of Honor" on a flickering TV. He looks up, sees the .38 before he sees Bud beyond it. Fitch drops his spoon, raises his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud SHOOTS him in the face. Dead, Fitch just sits there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud moves behind him. Pulling a spare piece from an ankle holster, Bud FIRES back at the door from Fitch's line of fire, then puts the gun in Fitch's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear the FRONT DOOR CRASH OPEN. As Fitch slides off the chair to the floor, Bud dumps the Rice Krispies on him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GRAY HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Girl on a stretcher. Being carried to an AMBULANCE. Bud White walks alongside, looking like some ferocious pet pit bull. The ATTENDANTS get her inside. One joins her. The other closes the door, pauses to light a smoke.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud rips the cigarette out of his mouth, nearly taking the guy's lips with it.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>

Fontaine and Navarette raise their hands. A jostled BEER BOTTLE CRASHES to the floor. Reacting, Carlisle JERKS the TRIGGER. Fontaine goes down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Navarette draws a .38, SHOOTS Carlisle twice in the chest. Exley BLASTS Navarette.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Screaming, Jones pulls a .45 from his belt. Exley FIRES, blowing him right THROUGH the WINDOW.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coates draws and FIRES, makes a run for it. A bad pull takes out half a back wall. Coates is out the door.

Exley returns to grudging respect. His white shirt flecked with blood, he's clapped on the back by Dudley who dubs him "Shotgun Ed." Exley doesn't enjoy it. He's numb, stumbling along. As he notices the blood on his hands...

Rain. A limo disgorges a heavy-set man who climbs steps, knocks on the door. Lynn answers in an evening gown. He gives her a peck on the cheek and continues in past her. Lynn's about to follow him in when she pauses to deadpan a look down the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud's Packard is parked there and we can see his darkened silhouette behind the wheel. Smiling a bit sadly to herself, Lynn disappears inside.

Jack says something about "We appreciate your understanding during this difficult time." As "Badge of Honor" comes on the TV, the father responds with "Goddamn actors."

Exley steps up. The Chief hangs a gold medallion around his neck. Flashbulbs pop as the two men shake hands.

Exley then accepts a handshake from Dudley. The policemen stand on cue, applaud without enthusiasm. Dudley lifts the medal from his chest.

	Something's wrong. I feel it inside. Doesn't that sound crazy?

Dudley puts an arm around Exley's shoulder, smiles out as more bulbs flash.

	Breaking a big case sticks you in a whirlwind. A little self-doubt? It's natural. Just keep it inside. Between you and you.

Exley considers his medal. It is an appealing thing.

Applause. Leaving the podium, Chase smiles at Ellis Loew's daughter who absolutely gushes. Chase then winks knowingly to Jack who returns a tired, humorless smile.
</DIRECTION>

Jack scans the room. An odd moment as Jack catches his own reflection in a mirror across the way. He puts a hand to his face. Is that him?

</HUDGEONS>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And Reynolds?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<HUDGEONS>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's twice the fifty you got for wrecking his career.

Reynolds gets a nervous bead on Loew. Hudgeons realizes:

	You need a drink, kid... Jack, look after him a minute. Kid, this is Jack. No secrets between me and him.

Reynolds looks like he's going to cry. Hudgeons returns with a double Scotch straight up and a hot dog with sauerkraut. He hands the drink to Matt.

<HUDGEONS>

	Dutch courage, kid. Drink up.

Reynolds downs a few gulps, looks across the room at Loew.

Reynolds looks to Jack who gives a noncommittal shrug.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Loew's free. Congratulate him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Reynolds nods, drains his glass and heads off. Hudgeons hands Jack a folded slip of paper.
</DIRECTION>
<HUDGEONS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If Reynolds works his charms, which he will, this is the address where they'll be. Meet me at midnight. I guarantee all sorts of illegal activity.

Hudgeons takes out a President Grant $50 bill. Jack doesn't take it.

</HUDGEONS>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Around.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<HUDGEONS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jackie, all I know is what you know. The man is very rich. And he's invested in freeway construction so he's gonna get a lot richer. But that's it. Patchett's what I like to call 'Twilight.' He ain't queer, he ain't Red, he can't help me in my quest for prime sinuendo.
	</DIALOGUE>

Jack takes the $50 as Reynolds returns, shaking his head.

Emboldened by Jack's promise, Reynolds heads off. Jack and Hudgeons watch as he strikes a conversation with Loew who's captivated. Hudgeons chomps a bite of his hot dog, gives Jack the high sign, but Jack just feels like a pimp.

Lynn comes to Bud naked, her hair brushed back. Bud goes slow, gently, takes time with his kisses: like she was a lonely woman he wanted to love to death.

	Susie, I told you I didn't approve of that boyfriend. He was too old for you. You let him come into this house and be fresh to me. I went out one day and old Mrs. Jensen next door saw Susan's boyfriend and another man and thought she heard a ruckus.

	What was that boyfriend's name?

Innocuous except for the smell. It hits Bud right off.

Bud elbow-crawls over the dirt, between wooden pilings.

There's a long burlap sack ahead. It smells bad. Bud rips burlap. A rat's nest explodes. Bud sweeps a forearm at them. As they clear, he sees a gristle-caked human skull staring back, a .38 hole in the forehead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Undaunted, Bud tears the burlap back further. He pats the corpse's pockets, comes up with a wallet. Bud checks the ID. "Turner Meeks." Bus knows him by that name and another.

Johnny taps his ring harder. The bottle almost tips.

<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His file listed you as a known associate. Now spill.

</BUD>
<STOMPANATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yeah. That was a long time ago. Before your day. The last few years he's been muscle for hire. But I heard he's disappeared.

	Before Meeks disappeared he was popping off about trying to move eighteen pounds of heroin.

</EXLEY>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bud White. He sees us and we're dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
They press up to the glass for a partial view. Bud White sits on a footstool massaging a pair of women's feet. Jack and Exley exchange a long, curious look. This isn't the Bud White they're used to. A pair of woman's hands take Bud, the arms covered in glitter and satin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The woman, Lynn Bracken, leans forward to kiss her policeman. It may have been a long day, but she's every inch Veronica Lake. Only the hair's not over her eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They stand, kiss again. Lynn's gown spills down around her ankles. Bud scoops Lynn into his arms and the two of them disappear into a bedroom. A long beat before...

	And you're that other celebrity Hollywood policeman, aren't you?

	Really? What did White say?

</EXLEY>
<LYNN>

Exley lets it pass. As he enters...
</DIRECTION>
<EXLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's concentrate on my smarts. Pierce Patchett made you, didn't he? He taught you how to dress and talk and think and I am very impressed with the results. But I need some answers and if I don't get them, I'm going to take you and Patchett down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXLEY>
<LYNN>

Exley stews. Lynn watches him over the rim of her glass.

</EXLEY>
<LYNN>

<EXLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll take your word for it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXLEY>
<LYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see Bud because he makes me feel like Lynn Bracken and not some Veronica Lake look-alike who fucks for money. I see him because he doesn't know how to disguise who he is. There's more if you want to hear it.

</LYNN>
<DIRECTION>
Exley shakes his head. He's heard enough.

<LYNN>

	Does all that make it harder for you to hate him or easier?

</LYNN>
<EXLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't hate White. I really don't. It's just, in my business, it's the wild cars you have to watch out for.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXLEY>
<LYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't like that you don't know how to play him. He doesn't follow the same rules of politics you do. That makes him dangerous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYNN>
<EXLEY>

	You cut to the heart of things, don't you? What about Lynn Bracken? She going to be a hooker all her life?

</LYNN>
<EXLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not?

Jack shakes his head. Dudley raises a REVOLVER. He FIRES it at point-blank range, right into Jack's heart. Jack hits the floor, his cheek pressed flat on the linoleum.

Jack opens his mouth to speak. His lips form the words, but no sound comes out. Dudley crouches down beside him.

	Sergeant Vincennes' body was found in Echo Park at ten o'clock this morning. Killed by a single .38 round to the heart. One of our own, gentlemen. We cannot tolerate it. Justice must be swift and merciless. That's all.

Hudgeons flinches as Bud steps up, twice Breuning's size.

<HUDGEONS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Okay. Everyone knows Patchett's worth a boat-load of greenbacks. From aviation, freeway construction. But the man has hobbies, too. He bankrolls B movies under the table and runs movie star look-alike hookers. And try this on: he's rumored to be a periodic heroin sniffer. All in all a powerful behind-the- scenes strange-o.

Blue, Lynn sits on her porch watching the rain come down. A SCREECHING on the wet street as Bud's PACKARD pulls up. She watches as he gets out and starts for the house. Lynn stands, holds her arms out. Bud stops short on the steps, out of reach, the rain soaking him.

Bud backhands her, hard. Lynn faces straight into the next one as Bud hits her again. A third time as the sins of the father are visited on the son. Bud stops short as the self-realization slams home. Lynn waits stoically. She doesn't start crying till Bud turns and runs back into the rain.

INT. RECORDS ROOM - LAPD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Drawers are open. Files are everywhere. Exley's reached the end of the line. As he looks through one last file, he finds a stack of official photos. Then he stops short. There's a photo of four cadets and an academy instructor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two of the cadets are IDed as Turner Meeks and Dick Stensland. The instructor is Dudley Smith!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Exley looks up at the sound of FOOTSTEPS and Bud is there. Fury. He slams Exley, knocks him flat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud's here to kill him. He hauls Exley up, pummels him, then throws him over the table. Then up into a wall. Plaster cracks. Bud's on some gonzo animal plane. Bud strangles him. Exley gags. It'll be over in moments.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Until Exley's flailing hands finds Bud's .38. Yanking it from his waistband, Exley smashes Bud in the forehead. Bud reels. But, blind with rage, he moves back in only to have the barrel of the .38 placed right between his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<EXLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>

</EXLEY>

Bud hesitates, the answer obvious.
</DIRECTION>
<EXLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen to me. Dudley killed Jack. It has something to do with Buzz Meeks.

Exley points out the academy photo on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<EXLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look. Dudley and Meeks go way back. Stensland, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Bud sees, but does he really? As Bud reaches for the photo, Exley relaxes slightly. Bud slaps the gun away, drops Exley to the ground. He grabs, begins slamming his head into the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<EXLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Think, goddamn you. Think...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Exley's almost out. But maybe Bud heard him. The attack slows, stops as Bud does think. Exley stays conscious.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I knew Stensland and Meeks knew each other. Meeks was with Sue Lefferts on Christmas Eve. The night I met Lynn. Lefferts' mother I.D.ed Stensland as Lefferts' boyfriend, but Stens pretended he didn't know either one of them.

	Stensland and Buzz Meeks. Two-man triggers knocking off Mickey Cohen lieutenants. When they killed Deuce Perkins, they got heroin as a bonus.
	</DIALOGUE>

	Then something goes wrong. Meeks gets killed. Maybe Stens got greedy, killed Meeks and left him under his girlfriend's house.

Exley in the hotseat. Sitting there thinking. At a CAR DOOR CLOSING, he goes to the door.

Exley opens the door as Bud approaches, toting a shotgun. The sun is down. The sky is just a dull glow.

As the reality sinks in, Bud and Exley hear TIRES on the GRAVEL; CARS are COMING. Being in a concavity, they don't see them yet. Then the CARS STOP. But still Bud and Exley can't see anything. They hear the CLICKS of CAR DOORS OPENING, but they don't hear them shut. There are FOOTSTEPS, MURMURED WHISPERS. More CARS PULL UP.

There's a big back window. Bud covers most of it with a ratty old mattress. He pumps the shotgun.

He pulls a .45 automatic from his waistband.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here.

He throws the auto to Exley, pulls out a .38. Bud's armed for bear.

<DIRECTION>
A CREAK outside the front door. Bud levels the SHOTGUN. BOOM! The DOOR is BLOWN OFF ITS HINGES. We see the figure of a man sprawl back in the dirt. In the darkness beyond, MUZZLE FLASHES from all around. Exley and Bud RETURN FIRE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear the BACK WINDOW BREAK under a MUFFLED BLOW. Bud charges back, yanks down the mattress revealing two men climbing through. Sitting ducks: torn apart by THREE TRIPLE-AUGHT ROUNDS close in. A beat, then...
</DIRECTION>
<EXLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We got him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Bud smiles, in on the plan as theres an answering WHOOP. A third man looks through the window. BOOM! Bud nails him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud motions Exley to stay put, then slips out the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. VICTORY MOTEL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud crouches, looks between the cinder blocks supporting the room. Two sets of feet shuffling along. Bud FIRES the SHOTGUN. Shrieks as the men go down. Bud extends the .38 to fire point blank headshots. Then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud flattens himself as a wicked CROSSFIRE TEARS UP ROOM 6.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VICTORY MOTEL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Exley is forced down as well, lying flat as plaster rains down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door frame splinters as more Dudley men charge in. Four men with rifles. One is Patchett's Burly Bodyguard. They spot Exley lying there. Hushed whispers as they approach: "Dead meat." "Be careful." Kicks in the side. The men look at each other, sneer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Exley jerks a foot. The foot man stumbles as Exley spins around SHOOTING. FIRING the .45 and his own .38. All four men go down. Exley stands, digs into his pocket to reload.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud scrambles back through the window. Exley looks over and smiles as Bud reloads the shotgun. It's dead quiet.
</DIRECTION>
<EXLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm thinking we might walk away from this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXLEY>
<DIRECTION>
At that instant, Dudley steps through the bathroom door. He's got Exley dead to rights. As he squeezes the trigger, Bud leaps forward, pushes Exley hard to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SHOT passes through Bud's back by his left shoulder blade. It spins him around. A SECOND SHOT to the stomach slows him to a walk as he charges Dudley. A THIRD ROUND SHATTERS Bud's jaw, but still he comes. Driven by rage, his hands reaching for Dudley's throat. He even gets hold before a FOURTH SLUG tears his chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud falls hard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dudley swings his aim to Exley who's just managed to shake the cobwebs of being flattened by Bud. A frozen moment.

	A vacuum, Edmund. That's what we have in Los Angeles. Sending Mickey Cohen up created it. My containment work maintained it. Certain photographs guarantee it. Organized crime has been held back, but there's still a demand for the services it provides.

<EXLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And now you'll provide them.

<DUDLEY>

	Absolutely. Prostitution and gambling are victimless crimes. The heroin we'll run down to the coloreds. Anesthetize them. As long as it's not a middle class problem, no one will care. It's still a crime free city... for respectable people.

Dudley aims the .38, cocks back the hammer. We hear DISTANT POLICE SIRENS.

	This isn't politics, Edmund. There won't be winners and losers when it's over...

Dudley doesn't see Bud stir, reach into a pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<DUDLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just the living and the dead. It's always been that way in the Bureau. You should've realized that before you became a detective.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUDLEY>
<DIRECTION>
It's over. Dudley's finger tightens on the trigger. But Dudley screams as Bud buries a switchblade into his left calf. It took all Bud had left. As he collapses...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dudley wails; Exley dives for Bud's shotgun. Dudley FIRES, misses. A wild SHOTGUN BLAST takes out half the wall. Dudley stumbles out the door. SIRENS BLARE.

Exley looks back at Bud. Bud presses his hands to the glass. Exley touches his side, palms half the man's size. Hands against hands.

<DIRECTION>
FADE TO BLACK.

THE END
