<DIRECTION>
TURKEY -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOUND UNDER, SHARP: CRACKLE - RIP - SNIP...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE IN:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SET OF CLOTHES ON A HOTEL ROOM BED -- trenchcoat, bulky white turtle-neck sweater, T-shirt, jeans, Western style boots. SOUNDS continue, Accentuated. MOVE Across open TRAVEL BAGS On The bed. Clothes, possessions. CONTINUE Across FURNITURE, WASHBASIN, TOILET...A large room, high old ceilings And windows suggesting Ancient Europe & design, A haunting greenish AFTERNOON light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We MOVE to HANDS, TIGHT - drawing out a strip of adhesive tape,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCISSORS move in TIGHT...SNIP!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNDERARM, TIGHT. Tape being laid over it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK OF SHOULDER. TIGHT. Tape going on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BELLYBUTTON, TIGHT. TAPE going Then: a harsh RIP! SOUND and the tape comes off the bellybutton.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HANDS with new strip of tape. Moving to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HASHISH PLAQUE. Four of them, thinly pressed. One on top of the other. The HAND wrapping a portion of the TAPE around them and:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BELLY, TIGHT. SOUNDS of BREATHING stop. The belly is sucked in. The TAPE is pulled HARD across, then CLINCHED. We hear F.X. of HEART BEAT--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVE UP THE CHEST TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY HAYES - 21, baby-face, attractive, medium build an aura of innocence. His eyes moving off his belly to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MIRROR. FULL SHOT. Climax. A creature in a bondage of his own devise, he is naked in his underpants, his body criss-crossed by a network of TAPE and 40 tightly pressed plaques of HASHISH in every conceivable crevice of his body. The eyes are hard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NIX THROUGH HEART BEAT, SOUNDS OF AIRPORT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ISTANBUL AIR TERMINAL dirty, crowded, wooden benches, peddlers. Turkish flight instructions on LOUDSPEAKER, followed by mediocre English translations. NOTE: ALL DIALOGUE IN TURKISH TO FOLLOW WILL BE MARKED OFF BY PARENTHESIS. A CERTAIN WILL BE SUBTITLED, BUT SOME NOT.

	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUDSPEAKER_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
REPEAT IN ENGLISH over:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILL walking down a long CORRIDOR. He moves somewhat stuffly in the clothes we saw laid out on the bed; his face complicated by dark, rather ridiculous aviator sunglasses and an increasing edge of nervousness to his actions. With him is:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUSAN 23, healthy outdoor looks, dressed casually colorful like an American student abroad.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
APPROACHING P.O.V. - a group of TURKISH SECURITY GUARDS, in rumpled green uniforms, at a security CHECKPOINT inspect the carry-on bags of several PASSENGERS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY tensely contemplating the guards as he walks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUSAN digging in her bag for her passport as she walks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY, looking from guards ahead to SUSAN. He suddenly breaks stride, still a fair distance from the checkpoint. SUSAN glances at him. He is holding his belly.
</DIRECTION>
<BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I've been poisoned.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<SUSAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you ate two baclavas, right? I not to touch them, mine was awful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSAN>
<BILLY>
<DIRECTION>
(his voice strained)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I think I'm going to have to go to the john again. You go on through, I'll catch up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<DIRECTION>
With a sense of panic, he turns and goes back down the corridor without waiting for a response. SUSAN concerned, moves on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY in the WASHROOM MIRROR, again checks himself out. His glasses are off, and he has just watered himself down. But the SOUND of his HEARTBEAT is up, and his nerves are visible in his eyeballs and he knows it. He dabs at the sweat on his sideburns. He closes his eyes, takes a DEEP BREATH. A pause. He puts his dark sunglasses back on. Turns away from the mirror. No going back now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ADVANCING P.O.V. - SECURITY CHECKPOINT. The GUARDS again. Closer, closer, Guns in their HOLSTERS. SOUND of billy's heartbeat,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE - GUARD smoking a cigarette, bored, uniform, looks at BILLY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The GUARDS again.SOUND of Billy's in a tattered olive

BILLY PASSPORT. The Guard's tobacco-stained FINGERS take it open it. Basic information on Billy: Birth Date April 17, 1949. Birth Place: Babylon, Long Island. No wife, no minors. Signature.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GUARD gives it back to BILLY.
</DIRECTION>
<GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bag!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY opens his shoulder bag, proffers it. The GUARD tosses it, pushing aside books, grabbing a white plastic dish.
</DIRECTION>
<GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nebu?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD>
<BILLY>
<DIRECTION>
(Understand the

	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
"What's this?")
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a frisbee.

	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
wrist)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You throw, catch it. Game!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<DIRECTION>
Curious, one of the other GUARDS ambles over looking at the frisbee.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY tightens. Cursing the frisbee. Sweat now runs his sideburns again. HEARTBEAT up.
</DIRECTION>
<2ND_GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	American game. Baseball.
	</DIALOGUE>
</2ND_GUARD>
<GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(puzzled, turns the
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frisbee around and
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
around)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SECOND GUARD studies BILLY curious about the sweat. Suddenly reaches up, indicates the eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take off the glasses.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY understanding the gesture rather than the words, removes his glasses. His eyes. Straight, staring at the GUARD without trying to look away. A long moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FIRST GUARD stuffs the frisbee back into the bag. Scowls. Takes a puff on his cigarette, coughs. Phlegm rattles around in his throat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reads the International Herald Tribune, seated on a crowded olive-colored out on the tarmac She has saved him a seat and pulls her bag off as BILLY sits down.
</DIRECTION>
<FIRST_GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aaaah!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FIRST_GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
He waves BILLY through.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY puts his glasses walks past the back the SECOND GUARD turns away. BILLY walks past the Checkpoint. His HEARTBEAT drops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUSAN reads the International Herald Tribune, seated on an crowded olive-colored BUS out on the tarmac. She has save him a seat and pulls her bag off as BILLY sits down.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you all right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSAN>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at her. Relief. A smile, awkward - he wishes he could tell her.
</DIRECTION>
<BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah... Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<DIRECTION>
Lays his head back on the wooden bench. Reaches out:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TAKES HER HAND in his. She returns the grip.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BUS DOOR slams shut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE TURKISH BUS DRIVER rolls the bus out towards the PLANES visible in the far distance?.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUSAN, feeling Billy is better, shows him the Herald Tribune.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSAN>

	<DIALOGUE>
	D'you see this? Janis Joplin died yesterday.

	Never was anybody like you...

<SUSAN>
<DIRECTION>
(annoyed, brushes
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
her throat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't take anything seriously.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSAN>
<BILLY>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<DIRECTION>
Bus stops suddenly. BILLY changes expression.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THROUGH FRONT WINDSHIELD we see TURKISH SOLDIERS in several HALFTRACKS drawn up in a semicircle blocking the bus. The Pan American PLANE is directly behind. Also JEEPS and a POLICEMAN waving the bus down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BUS BOOR opens and the Turkish Police OFFICER hops aboard briskly:
</DIRECTION>
<OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Attention please, Ladies and Gentlemen. For your own safety we're conducting a security check before you board your airplane, Kindly file out the back. Women and children in one line. Men in another.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
PASSENGERS. A confused hum.
</DIRECTION>
<VARIOUS_PASSENGERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's he saying? I don't know... Marian. Hey Marian, what the hell...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VARIOUS_PASSENGERS>
<DIRECTION>
The Turkish-speaking PASSENGERS are gathering together their items and beginning to exit as:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POLICE OFFICER repeats, in ENGLISH
</DIRECTION>
<POLICE_OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Idem.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POLICE_OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE BILLY. The POLICE OFFICER is only beginning the speech.in English but already Billy realizes, And it's panic. Silent panic. That horrendous cold feeling all over his back: Oh God what have I done, what can I do now? He freezes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVE TO SUSAN rising, fetching her things, irritated.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, they do everything ass backwards in Turkey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSAN>
<DIRECTION>
Behind her we see the other AMERICAN PASSENGERS beginning to disembark with the usual chorus of overlapped conversations, expletives, including:
</DIRECTION>
<PASSENGERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're checking for hijackers. Any Palestinians aboard? Hey Harry, get rid of your grenades...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PASSENGERS>
<DIRECTION>
Laughter is returned from several of the American contingent, but we MOVE BACK to BILLY in foreground; all of a sudden he is on his knees trying to crawl under the seat.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSAN>
<DIRECTION>
(OFF)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Billy, what's the matter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSAN>
<BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My passport!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<SUSAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSAN>
<DIRECTION>
She bends down to look, coming FACE TO FACE with him. He grips her arm.
</DIRECTION>
<BILLY>
<DIRECTION>
(low voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Susan - forget it. Go get us a seat on the plane. Now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<SUSAN>
<DIRECTION>
(picking up the
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	real fear in his
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it? . . . Billy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSAN>
<BILLY>
<DIRECTION>
(a fierce whisper, panic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For Christ's sake, just GET on the plane, okay!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<DIRECTION>
His tone stuns her; never before has he spoken to her like that. A LOOK between them; he has his glasses off now. She's not a stupid girl by any means and realizes something is very wrong and for the both of them, she'd best do exactly as he says. And fast. She moves OUT OF SHOT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY, crouched low in the aisle starts to work fast, his finger: shaking reaching into his sweater starting to work the TAPE loose from around his chest; looking from under the bench. Still quite a bit of commotion as passengers are exiting. BUT THEN:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY P.O.V. - UNIFORMED LEGS coming slowly down Isle Towards him. The muzzle of An M-l RIFLE tapping loosely Against the side of the kneecap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAN WITH and MOVE UP as TURKISH MILITARY LIEUTENANT comes into view, intersecting outgoing PASSENGERS, eyes casually coming to rest on:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY looks up from his kneeling position on floor; his sweater rolled back down; he indicates the passport in his hand. "Just found it" expression.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVE to the LIEUTENANT not necessarily suspecting anything, but with a customary insolence reserved for young vagrant- types, he stretches his rifle arms length with one hand and gently prods Billy up with the tip of the muzzle placed under his chin. MOVE BACK to the OFFICER, bringing the rifle back to his side, indicating Billy get off the bus with the others. All in silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY among a group of MALE PASSENGERS funnelling into two lines that pass on either side of a wooden inspection table. Thirty TURKISH SOLDIERS with rifles ring the area. It is open, vast, no place to run or hide. The only apparent hope is to melt into their regular jostling patterns of the passengers impatiently waiting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO PLAINCLOTHESMEN (Police) are on each side of the table, body-searching the male passengers alternately.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUSAN is in a similar set-up twenty yards away, with FEMALE ATTENDANTS doing the searching. She glances at Billy as she undergoes search. She is cleared, passes on, towards the ramp of the plane.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY, his sunglasses off, smoothly melts among the male PASSENGERS pulling some books from his shoulder bag. Glides to the head of the line. MOVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The FIRST OFFICER patting down a PASSENGER, his back partially turned to Billy. MOVE AROUND bringing him into foreground as:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY skirts him in the background, camouflaged among two other conversing PASSENGERS waiting for the SECOND OFFICER who now appears in foreground on the lateral TRACK; he is busy with another passenger. In passing him, Billy replaces the books in his shoulder bag as though he had already been searched by the first officer,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tension. FOLLOW BILLY as he approaches the boarding ramp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY P.O.V. - SUSAN at the top of the ramp waiting. Smiling STEWARDESSES. Pan America. Haven.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY - FOOT rising off Turkish soil onto ramp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TURKISH HAND lightly touching Billy's elbow, then grasping the ARM.
</DIRECTION>
<TURK>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a minute!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TURK>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY his eyes flattening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUSAN in LONG SHOT, reacting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY turns trying to seem casual; he confronts the SECOND OFFICER face to face and gestures towards the:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FIRST OFFICER who happens to glance at them.
</DIRECTION>
<SECOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nebu? Did you search him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECOND>
<FIRST_OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
(frowns)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FIRST_OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
SECOND OFFICER tightens his grip on BILLY, angry, and pulls him back to the TABLE. MOVE with them. The officer has been lied to; in addition he is young, inexperienced, about eighteen.
</DIRECTION>
<SECOND_OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
(grunts a command, makes a gesture)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY, comprehending, spreads his arms. The OFFICER pats him down carefully, brushing against his armpits. Precisely in the area where we saw the hashish. But incredibly he doesn't notice, continuing to work his way down the hips and legs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE BILLY eyes on the sky behind the OFFICER, praying silently for a break.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TURKISH FINGERS moving up the inside of his legs, onto his belly, touching the hard bulge below the navel. But again not noticing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY in limbo, SOUND of his heartbeat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SECOND OFFICER pausing, his fingers around Billy's chest, about to let it go, then:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PLACES HIS HAND suddenly flat on Billy's heart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OFFICER, sensing the accelerated Heartbeat, stares at:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY whose eyes jump, startled by this technique.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FINGERS like excited spiders quickly run back up into the armpit area. STOP - right on the packets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TURKISH EYES SWIVEL to BILLY EYES CLOSE. Frozen moment. Then, sudden blur of movement at the edge of frame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SECOND OFFICER jumping back, grabbing his pistol from his holster, crouching on one knee, aiming the gun barrel at BILLY, hand shaking. He is terrified.
</DIRECTION>
<SECOND_OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
(screaming)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bomb! He's got a bomb!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECOND_OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
AMERICAN PASSENGERS scream and the deck all around.
</DIRECTION>
<AMERICAN_PASSENGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bomb! Bomb!
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMERICAN_PASSENGER>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY stands there, arms straight up in the air, eyes clamped shut, trying not to breathe. CHORUS of rifle and revolver CLICKS OFF as:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULL BACK to OVERHEAD SHOT BILLY surrounded by thirty SOLDIERS with rifles pointed at him from all directions, crouched nervously. The PASSENGERS all huddled on the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY, eyes closed. Edge of frame shows a shaky muzzle a REVOLVER poked into his belly, moving up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVE to THE FIRST OFFICER, older, more experienced but scared, poking with the revolver; reaches in with his hand cautiously, starts to pull up the turtleneck sweater. MOVE with the hand, revealing the HASHISH PLAQUES around the navel. A pause. His HAND draws the sweater higher. More PLAQUES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FIRST OFFICER'S FACE relaxes. Starts to smile, finding it funny.
</DIRECTION>
<FIRST_OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
(yells out)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's hashish. just a smuggler.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FIRST_OFFICER>
<SOLDIERS>
<DIRECTION>
(OFF) (in chorus echo, relaxing, chuckling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hashish...smuggler...hippy...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLDIERS>
<DIRECTION>
MASTER ANGLE SOLDIERS REGROUPING. PASSENGERS starting to rise from the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUSAN dumbfounded watching all this from the door of the PLANE, starts back down the ramp. But a flow of upcoming PASSENGERS slows her descent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY is led roughly by TWO SOLDIERS parallel to the plane his hands on his head. He manages a glance at Susan. A slight but strong movement of the head and eyes. 'No. Don't come down the stairs'
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUSAN understands it, looks helplessly, hesitates lost between two worlds. A silent shaping of a puzzled mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Billy...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSAN>
<DIRECTION>
She is washed back along in the flow of passengers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIP ROOM AIRPORT LOUNGE. The scene moves very fast, Indicating A sense of chaos. Much smoke. Many phone calls. Half A dozen Turkish police OFFICERS Are bizarrely seated In A row of fold up chairs next to A desk. Chattering among themselves (AD LIB) lighting their Turkish cigarettes. They hardly pay attention as:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVE TO BILLY, scared, sweating - backlit by the huge windows overlooking the airstrip. In background, we see the 707 Pan American PLANE beginning to circle towards the runway. GUARDS have stripped him down to his bare chest and now knife through the adhesive tape from two sides at once. Then RIP the tape off. BILLY winces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE the room. Billy's luggage Is being Tossed. Clothes fly through the air. A sweatshirt; Marquette University Rowing Team. A 35mm camera. A gift package for his mother ripped open. A silver Turkish kettle, clanging To The floor. Another package is ripped open and a set of Turkish tea cups smash and break all over the floor. Very fast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY watches, bewildered. He is stripped of the last plaque in of the confusion is that each time another police officer

A LOUD SOUND OFF.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The DOOR flies open and ANOTHER OFFICER strides in. Paunchy, moustached. The room is suddenly silent as we TRACK him in, followed by a grinning civilian FLUNKY with a big portable photo instrument and bulb.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FIRST OFFICER jumps up from the desk, makes an obsequious salute to the SECOND OFFICER who arrogantly acknowledges it and takes the vacated chair behind the desk. The FIRST OFFICER moves to the first fold-up chair in the row, pushing the police officer in that chair further down. THIS OFFICER, in turn, shoves the next man down. It goes all the way down the line like a comedy until the last man in the row stands up against the wall. But this is all in the background as:

Sharp SOUND OFF of FILM BEING RIPPED FROM CAMERA. He darts a look at
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POLICEMAN stretching the undeveloped film out. Another loud SOUND OFF, interrupting this--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE DOOR flies open again and a THIRD OFFICER strides in, obviously the most important yet, because the SECOND OFFICER jumps up from the desk, and all the others immediately move down one seat in the hierarchy without a moment's hesitation. But the THIRD OFFICER strides right up to Billy, waves to the SECOND OFFICER. THE CAMERAMAN in background bubbles with enthusiasm, sliding into position. Billy is puzzled - what's going on? His arm is grabbed and he is swivelled around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE ANGLE - OVER CAMERAMAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY in the middle, flanked by SECOND and THIRD OFFICER, grinning like big game hunters, their arms on his shoulders. The FIRST OFFICER, sticking a bunch of hashish plaques into Billy's hands, runs OUT OF FRAME. BILLY looks from side to side. The SECOND OFFICER pats him hard on the back of the head, meaning 'look at camera'. BILLY glances at him, sees the grin on both the officers' faces. Thinking this is the necessary expression, he grins at the camera.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERAMAN disgustedly looks up from his eyepiece.
</DIRECTION>
<CAMERAMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.. He's smiling. Make him look miserable.

SECOND OFFICER slugs BILLY in the stomach with a quick back-handed fist. BILLY groans, sinks to his knees. The plaques fall on the floor.

He growls, grabbing Billy's arm and hauling him up, gathering the hashish plaques and putting them back in his arms. The TWO OFFICERS put their arms back on Billy's shoulders. BILLY, in pain, makes the proper expression of misery.

THE 707 PAN AMERICAN PLANE, destination New York, roars up into the sky. PULL BACK all the way to BILLY sitting next to the window, huddled over, feeling woozy and near vomiting. He glimpses the plane but it is anti-climatic now; as he stares down at his boots. Then remembers something! Surprised.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE - ROOM. The Turkish OFFICERS talk AD LIB among themselves, congratulating, slapping shoulders, pointing to the hashish plaques, etc.

In center background, we see BILLY submissively lifting his arm for permission to speak,

<DIRECTION>
THIRD OFFICER nods, approaches, followed by OTHERS.

BILLY slowly, partly out of pain, pulls off one of his boots, bangs it on the heel and two more PLAQUES clatter to the floor.

TURKISH MOUTHS drop open.

BILLY finishes the process with the other boot. An awkward silence OFF.

BILLY spread-eagled STARK NAKED against the wall. He is afraid to move. A strange silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE. BILLY naked in center B.G. against the wall.The OFFICERS and SOLDIERS quietly leering at his trim, muscular buttocks. Hungry stares. Bisexuality is prevalent in Turkey.But there is also embarrassment among the officers; none would do anything openly in front of the others; instead they just stare and smoke their cigarettes. Low murmurs. Continued telephone calls. Much thick smoke all over the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another DOOR opens OFF. Obsequious GREETINGS in Turkish.

BILLY is afraid to look over his shoulder, feeling enormously humiliated.

TURKISH DETECTIVE sits at the main desk in the room. Unlike the others, he has no moustache; a skeletal face, intelligent looking. TEX Is behind, leaning casually up against the wall. Angled to Billy's side is the entire array of seated OFFICERS looking on like a tribunal.

THE PUDDING SHOPPE TWILIGHT Internationally-known cafe, adjacent BAZAAR. Crowded, noisy. WOMEN dressed in black hold crying CHILDREN by the hands. FOREIGNERS, mostly students and hippies, move about laughing, joking. Hawkers, street peddlers, vendors cooking shishkebab. small GYPSY BOY leads a huge MUZZLED BEAR on a leash.
</DIRECTION>

BILLY sits at a small outdoor TABLE alone sipping tea and eating baclava - nervous, very nervous, still trying to sort it all out in his head. If he doesn't find the seller, what will happen next?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVE across the TABLES, past a middle-aged AMERICAN COUPLE, to TWO TURKISH PLAINCLOTHESMEN watching him closely. They look evident. TWO HIPPIES make a wide berth around them.

INTERIOR PUDDING SHOPPE Large. Many tables. Stairs. A back exit.

ANOTHER GYPSY BOY leads a huge PINK PIG leashed with a wooden sign around its neck proclaiming "Pig" in Turkish. Various TURKS point the pig out, laughing at it, some disgusted by it, making faces and gestures: "Go way, go way! "Ayip!" The PIG moves past BILLY, who shifts his gaze to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV - CABDRIVER #1 lingering at the curb. PAN to CABDRIVER #2 PAN to CABDRIVER #3. PAN BACK to #1 and again to #2 indicating no real fix on identity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY tense now, knowing this is the chance he must take, nods with his head, pointing at CABDRIVER #2, off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE PLAINCLOTHESMEN move out towards CABDRIVER #2.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY tentatively rises, as if to join them, but moves slyly towards the interior of the cafe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PLAINCLOTHESMEN move in roughly on a surprised CABDRIVER #2 who begins to protest LOUDLY (AD LIB).

<DIRECTION>
BILLY moves through the INTERIOR of the PUDDING SHOPPE, past the tables, past the stairs, towards the back of the shop, at a normal.to attract attention.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A PLAINCLOTHESMAN looks around, sees he is gone. Tells the others (AD LIB) They spread out looking, abandoning the CABDRIVER #2 who spits and curses them (AD LIB).

BILLY, with one backward glance, now eases out the BACK DOOR, into a bilious sunlight, onto a STREET. Pause.

A HAND with GUN moves into FRAME pointing a six-inch barrel right at his temple. BILLY freezes, moving just his eyes to:

</ZIAT_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The cell is dark, almost black, an overpowering stench; a small grey metal bunk is bolted to the floor with a lumpy mattress. BILLY turns, looking back at the man staring at him from the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ZIAT is quickly summing up Billy's character. This is his craft.He is a prisoner and trustee. sinister man whose one motivation in life is the accumulation of money, in the pursuit of which he has acquired an ugly purplish SCAR running the width of his throat, various other facial SCARS; and one blind milky white EYE. He's stocky and strong -- about five ten, with bushy eyebrows, brown cigarette teeth, big dirty nails, repulsively in need of a bath. What's surprising is that he is no more than thirty years old looks and behaves like sixty. The personification of the denaturalization of a man. Time, body, mind - all of them warped.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY, not yet attuned to his nature, only repulsed, is still wearing his own clothes and makes a shivering gesture, enunciating very clearly, hoping he will understand.

<BILLY>

BILLY stops, goes to the edge of the cell.

A BONY BARE ARM motions from the bars of the cell next to his. We never see the face but hear a thick ITALIAN ACCENT, hoarse and cracked.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE - BILLY steps out into a WALKWAY. A bare bulb overhead casts light. He glides past the three cells, seemingly empty. Finds the cell with blankets, sheets, towels and various supplies stacked inside. But it's locked. He slips the stick in between the bars and stretching, hooks the first blanket.

BILLY asleep with the blankets pulled up to his chin. Suddenly DIRTY HANDS reach into frame and rip the blanket off. WIDEN TO:

Then SLAPS at BILLY. BILLY ducks away. Encouraged, ZIAT steps up closer to him, sticks his fingers in his chest screaming.
</DIRECTION>
<ZIAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You, goddamn you, give me sheet. Give me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZIAT>
<DIRECTION>
And feints as if to hit BILLY again. BILLY reacts to defend himself, pushing ZIAT off and jumping out of the bunk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ZIAT, Enraged by the shove, comes back at BILLY, screaming, arms flailing like a bear to pummel him, but BILLY, not understanding the Turkish bluster in his mannerisms, meets him with a sharp right FIST into the front of his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ZIAT staggers back, startled into silence; he has misjudged this kid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY waits, ready for the fight in the defensive position. The guy is bigger than himself. ZIAT, however, now feels the blood from his mouth and nose and freaks out, running out of the cell SCREAMING at the top of his lungs as if he's dying.

BILLY is blindfolded, stumbling down stone steps pushed by a GUARD, into a dungeon-like basement room. THE PUNISHMENT CELLS.

THE GUARD removes the blindfold. BILLY, adjusting to the light, stares around. The cell is spartan, with a series of pulleys and primitive bondage devices hanging from the cobwebbed ceiling.A DOOR opens and:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HAMIDOU STEPS in, lowering his head to get through the door.Chief of the guards. A clean uniform. Four stripes. The only guard to carry a holstered gun. very frightening man. He is about six two, two forty, and muscular, and moves lightly like a fighter on his feet. His skull is bullet-shaped and completely shaven like Billy's, Enhancing this effect, he has no eyebrows, and his pale blue eyes (suggesting a trace of Indo-European stock in his ancestry) are set deep in his skull somewhat like turtle eyes, giving nothing away. His nose is a beak of skin his neck broad, his mouth a small crescent that moves as lightly as his feet between anger and amusement. He approaches BILLY, looks into his eyes, drawing out the moment for himself, enjoying the tension and the fear he instils in others.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY meets his eyes respectfully, then realizing this is perhaps not the thing do to, looks away. But, fascinated by the man's features beyond his self-control, he looks back.
</DIRECTION>

HAMIDOU, amused by eye actions, smiles thinly. The sort of smile that could imply friendship such is its hint of charm.

BILLY watches, fascinated.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HAMIDOU lets the arm linger; then:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SMASHES BILLY across the face with an open palm. BILLY shoots back: and smashes against the wall just from the force of one blow. Stunned.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HAMIDOU advances, taking a wooden CLUB (FALUKA STICK) about feet three long and three inches wide from a GUARD.

BILLY tries to block it with his hand, and the CLUB smashes his thumb. SCREAM.

<DIRECTION>
SHARP CUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY is hoisted upside-down in his UNDERPANTS ONLY with thick rope tied about his ankles, the legs spread - onto a PULLEY suspended from the ceiling. He is yanked upwards, then lowered slightly, his head and backs of shoulders banging against the stone floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE PULLEY is LOCKED into place. (LOUD SOUND)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY has this surprised look on his face still, through the tears. What's happening?

<DIRECTION>
Hamidou motions the GUARDS out of the room (AD LIB). Turns back to BILLY, raises his club.

<DIRECTION>
BRINGS IT DOWN FORCE on the soles of BILLY'S BARE FEET. SCREAM. He cocks the club again.

BILLY SCREAMs louder than ever as we hear The SOUND of wood On bone. Whimpering SOUNDS follow.

BILLY still in the same position, vomits all over himself.

HAMIDOU SPINS the PULLEY to a new position bringing:

BILLY into a steeper, more vertical position. He is on the verge of fainting, bleary-eyed, looking as:

HAMIDOU moves around in between his legs. Doing something indistinct with the stick between his legs, then dropping the stick. Then, with this bizarrely excited expression on his hairless face, he begins to undo his own pants. But, for Billy, it all BLURS OUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAPANESE SILK SCREEN depicting a fat jovial Buddhist monk, fishing placidly by a stream. Then moves to soap carvings of chess pieces Then a bed-sheet hung as a curtain with astrological symbols paint; on it. SOUND OFF, of a blaring radio. Atonal TURKISH MUSIC.

<DIRECTION>
THE COURTYARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VARIOUS ANGLES The yard is 30 by 50 paces with a wall 20 feet high. Cigarette butts, orange peels crumpled news- papers, rocks, sticks, broken glass litter the place. No guards are on the walls; the only GUARDS are unarmed inanimate lumps of boredom who look as helpless as the prisoners with whom they intermingle; they have raggedy olive green uniforms and worn boots (they make $1 a month, augmented by bribes). On one side of the yard is a 2-story ROGUS (cellblock) with barred windows from which Billy and his two companions have just emerged. On the other side of the yard is another 2-story KOGUS (the children's kogus).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The COURTYARD is colorful, almost like a bazaar, about 8O people in it - groups of exotically dressed AFRICANS, AFGHANS, ARABS, MALAYSIANS, EUROPEANS, and predominantly TURKS pacing back and forth talking in little circles, hawking wares, trading illegal currencies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Screaming Turkish STREET URCHINS 10-14 years old, share the space playing soccer and volleyball with a surprising viciousness, continually hitting each other and cursing. A bunch of them vehemently lay bets on the soccer game.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Other aspects of the prison which should become evident: 1) NOISE - continuous, Loud. Radios, Turkish music, screaming, shouting. 2) CATS - all kinds, some of them pets, some stray, tolerated because they kill the rats. 3) THE PRISONERS all wear their own clothing; the foreigners preferring jeans, clip-clops, sneakers, Sweat suits. 4) THE HEADS of only the new prisoners are shaved, then allowed to grow back. 5) MANY PRISONERS have physical disabilities. Carbuncles on the back from wet mattresses. Boils on the lymph glands around the neck, buttocks, under-arms, sometimes SO painful the victim walks with his arms up in the air. Arthritic in the knees, hips, ankles. Fungus on the feet. Many limp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE - THE PRISONERS glance at BILLY as he walks, noting the beating he has taken and sizing him up, then going on with their business.

BELL's eyes follow a knot of KIDS to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ZIAT has a window open on the FIRST FLOOR KOGUS and is selling little cups of tea to the kids from inside where he works a GAS STOVE. The kids push and punch each other to get the tea faster.

	</DIALOGUE>
</BELL>
<DIRECTION>
ZIAT leaves the stove in the hands of an ASSISTANT and moves down the window to a particularly gaudy AFGHANI a fierce hawk-faced old man with a chunk of his ear missing. He wears a colorful flowing robe, various scarves, turban, trinkets, rings, baggy pants, and pointed curved shoes, and makes emphatic violent gestures at ZIAT with his mutilated THREE FINGERS. ZIAT Seems to speak something of his language and bargains back.

BILLY says nothing to them about the Ziat incident, sizing him up for himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE AFGHANI having concluded the deal with ZIAT reaches deep into his layers of clothing around his crotch and pulls out several scrofulous $10 bills which discreetly takes in exchange for a thick wad of Turkish currency, his eyes moving around, stopping on BILLY. A hooded look.

A pause. YESIL Shifts, Throats are cleared. BILLY moves to sit down, limping faintly; he is wearing sneakers and the bruises don't show.

<DIRECTION>
(lowers his voice, a hint of a smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell you the truth, I think the food is lousy. The crap they sell in these little restaurants. I went out to eat in one of them last night, and I had to run to the damn toilet... You shoulda' seen the toilet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean you got toilets?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>

FATHER is happy to see his son laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<FATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, with real toilet paper - and you don't have to use both sides.

BILLY laughs again.
</DIRECTION>
<FATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So now I'm eating at the Hilton every night.

BILLY smiles. A pause. A worried look returns to the Father's face
</DIRECTION>
<FATHER>

<BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know.

</BILLY>
<DIRECTION>
Glances at DAVIS, YESIL back to his father, his voice beginning to tremble, ashamed of himself for letting it show.
</DIRECTION>
<BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad get me out of here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE. The FATHER understands the desperation in his voice, puts his hand on his son's.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FATHER I promise you, Billy. Just sit tight and don't.. DON'T do anything stupid. Let me work with Mr. Yesil and Mr. Davis. We'll get you out... Okay? Billy, okay?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All the assurance of the world is written in this kindly Irishman's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY feels it.

	<DIALOGUE>
	THE world is now looking at Turkey. We are called the Heroin Supplier of the world. Stories about us are in newspapers and on television every day all around the world. The time has come, your Honor, to alter this image before we find ourselves isolated and morally ostracized by the rest of the human race...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROSECUTOR_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
THE COURTROOM - monolithic, frightening, immense with cross- currents of greenish light from the enormous windows. People seem insignificant.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE PROSECUTOR, wearing dark green glasses, continues, scowling, gesturing profusely at:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY in the PRISONERS DOCK, baroque design, isolated. Doesn't understand a thing, Erich's extra-large blue pin- striped suit makes him look rather absurd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS FATHER, CONSUL DAVIS, YESIL and ANOTHER LAWYER are seated together at the defence table conferring in low tones with each other. YESIL looks over at BILLY with a big reassuring grin, nods his head - nothing to worry about.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TURKISH GIRL from the Press with a yellow legal pad, makes notes in the Spectator Gallery. Her legs flare out from a short skirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY pries his eyes away to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PROSECUTOR continuing in front of the THREE JUDGES high on an Alice in Wonderland podium wearing long black robes with scarlet collars. One of the Judges is bald, the other has his eyes closed, could be asleep. The CHIEF JUDGE in the middle has a sagging somewhat kindly face and short grey hair. A YOUNG MAN below the podium, is clacking at an ancient typewriter on a small table.

<DIRECTION>
(OVER) (continuous)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...We must alter this image by punishing only our own drug smugglers-but by handing out foreigners who infest our culture with their depravity ungodly and behavior. We must start now - by sentencing this American, Vilyum Hi-yes, to the maximum sentence for smuggling, to be held up to the light of the world as an example of Turkish justice and its intention to halt the drug trade once and for all.. .I ask the Court therefore to sentence Vilyum Hi-yes to Life Imprisonment.

He sits, staring malignantly at BILLY.

THE JUDGES rise.

	Thank you, Prosecutor. The Court will now recess to consider its verdict.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<DIRECTION>
The JUDGES exit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE, General commotion in the courtroom as people move about. The FATHER and DAVIS and the OTHER LAWYER consult among themselves, the FATHER vigorously nodding his head. YESIL approaches BILLY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY leans forward anxiously in the dock.
</DIRECTION>
<BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What'd the Prosecutor say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<YESIL>
<DIRECTION>
(hurried)

(pressing)

But YESIL is called over by the other LAWYER and hurries off. A SOLDIER comes over and sits BILLY down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CHIEF JUDGE puts on his glasses, stands to read the verdict.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
YESIL, standing with the OTHERS, motions BILLY to rise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY rises, tense.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FATHER looks over at him, manages a reassuring smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JUDGE continuing, after preliminaries:
</DIRECTION>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Defendant has been found guilty by the Court of the illegal possession of Hashish...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<DIRECTION>
PROSECUTOR, his expression souring, makes a gesture of defeat. We wanted a conviction for smuggling, not possession.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY, not understanding sees the Prosecutor's gesture, and a hint of hope crosses his expression.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JUDGE puts the paper away, looks at BILLY directly.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Therefore. this court sentences you, Vilyum Hi-yes to be imprisoned at Sagamilcar Prison for a term of four years and two months. This Case is now closed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY looking at the JUDGE doesn't understand. Thinks he might be free. But suddenly TWO SOLDIERS move in, and start chaining his hands together. He is bewildered, looking at:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
YESIL hastily conferring with Billy's FATHER, more concerned about making a good impression with him than with Billy.
</DIRECTION>
<YESILF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Four years, two months. It's good.

<DIRECTION>
BILLY watching this, a lost look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FATHER is too shocked to do anything but look at YESIL who continues on:
</DIRECTION>
<YESIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You will see, he will have maybe one year taken off this sentence for good behaviour. Remember, it is only for possession; the prosecutor wanted life sentence for smuggling...
	</DIALOGUE>

	To be honest Mr. Hayes, it is a great victory!

(embarrassed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...With good time Billy it works out to about 3 years... then there's the appeal. Yesil, Davis, they're all working for you We're going to try to make a deal to get you transferred to a Stateside prison. And Davis thinks there might be a political amnesty any month...

BILLY nods. His FATHER points to a stack of ITEMS on the conference table, picks up a cigarette carton.

HAMIDOU enters the room. A morbid curiosity in his expression about this show of grief. Watches a few moments, then indicating the visit is over, he taps his falaka stick lightly a few times on the hollow door. THWACK! THWACK!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FATHER breaks the embrace with BILLY, tears streaking his cheeks. Silently indicates for him to "Go, go Fast."

HAMIDOU who closes the door. He has an angry glint in his eye.

BILLY lies on his bunk at night deeply depressed, paler. Candlelight flutters softly against the stone walls. A PHOTO of SUSAN taken outdoors with a mountain range in the background, is on his wall with various SOAP CARVINGS of little chess piece she has designed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the distance, very faintly coming upwards into our sound consciousness we hear a TRAIN WHISTLING in the night, on an old railroad track bypassing the prison walls. Two whistles. Chugging. Then passing off. The Midnight Express.
</DIRECTION>
<BILLY_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dear Susan. 1970 has now passed into 1971. You can drift in here and never know you're gone. You can fade so far out and you don't know where you are anymore or where anything else is...

The CAMERA LINGERS on ZIAT in a far corner of the Kogus, top bunk, against a wall. Never secure, he shuffles in his sleep.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I feel myself drifting more heavily into smoking hashish. The haze helps the time pass. Also I do soap carvings. Erich taught me. And I have been learning Turkish because it helps me to deal with the guards and the prisoners. I'm trying hard to maintain some sort of schedule to my life, but sometimes it seems like I'm just trying in order to try...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
ZIAT is evidently awake he pulls his RADIO over into the bed, and peering around to make sure no one is watching, here moves the screws from the back of it, pulls off the cover and puts in a sheaf of large denomination GERMAN MARKS: inside we briefly glimpse a wad of different-colored CURRENCIES stacked with rubber bands.

	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
THE THREE they play against are hilarious looking in this context, moving like big clumsy bears, waving their arms and screaming at each other, disorganized. Ever conscious of fashion, they have their jackets and vests off but play in their Elvis Presley shirts rolled up at the sleeves, shiny slacks, black pointed pumps. The boys wear shorts and sneakers. On the sidelines we see a group of PRISONERS laying bets and shouting encouragement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY leaps up for a ball close to the net and as the TURKISH OPPONENT backs off, he dinks the ball in just over the net; the Turk SCREAMS his teammates scream at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BELL goes up for another ball close to the net and really SMASHES it with all his might, and:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BALL bangs right into the eye of a TURK who flails his arms and SCREAMS with pain, very theatrical.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

THE SAME TURK now swaggers around the COURTYARD, wearing sunglasses so no one will see his black eye.

	So is homosexuality. That's a big crime here but most of them do it every chance they get. There are about a thousand things that are "ayip". But they're really so hypocritical, like children breaking the rules. For instance...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly a CRY OFF and:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE TURK runs up, pulling a sharp SHIV from his pants, and using the cloth as a handle he repeatedly STABS BELL in the ass and backs of his thighs. One, two, three, four, five QUICK STABS, like a cook hammering veal. In spite of its violence, the action seems like slapstick.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BELL tumbles to the ground, crying out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE TURK stashes the shiv and disappears among his FRIENDS, his honor restored.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY and ERICH run over to help BELL who is obviously more in pain than in danger.
</DIRECTION>
<BILLY_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(continuous)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...You can stab or shoot some body the but not above the waist because that's intent to kill. So everybody runs around stabbing everyone else in the ass. That's what they call 'Turkish revenge'. There's also a lot of "Baksheesh" that's a favorite Turkish word for bribery...

LONG SHOT - HAMIDOU and ASLAN the young fat Turkish gangster pointed out previously by Erich, are taking tea together in the FIRST STORY KOGUS alone except for ZIATR and Hamidou's two FAT SONS, 7 and 8 years old, both dressed in little suits listening politely as Hamidou gestures to them, in couched terms.

	...What is the crime? And what is the punishment? The answer seems to vary from place to place, and from time to time. What's legal today is suddenly illegal tomorrow cause some society says it's so; and what's illegal yesterday all of a sudden gets legal today because everybody's doing it and you can't throw everybody in jail.

<DIRECTION>
BELL guarding the STAIRS.

THE SHAFT. BILLY leads the climbers UP.

MAX laughing, shaking his head.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>

(between giggles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's laughing? I mean I find this terribly depressing... Can you see old Hamidou's face when he tries to figure this one out?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY can't go on, starts to giggle at the thought.
</DIRECTION>
<BILLY>
<DIRECTION>
(between giggles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll tell him we were checking out our escape route. We wanted to be completely sure before we tried it.

ANOTHER ANGLE - the THREE of them, spaced along the shaft, are all giggling hysterically. Echoing. HOLD ON them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY comes through the HOLE in the stones in the SINK AREA. It is still NIGHT. He looks around - silence. MAX follows through the hole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY and MAX work fractically to seal up the STONES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BELL, exhausted, is at the STAIRS guarding. Distant early morning SOUNDS of prison waking up. We feel they will be spotted this time, but:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY slumps into his BUNK as the first rays of LIGHT come up in the sky and the CHANT from the Mosque commences. He immediately sinks into sleep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE on OLD TEA LEAVES being washed in the SINK. A MILKY WHITE EYE follows into view. ZIAT is preparing his early morning tea, his good eye now moving to something beyond the tea leaves. Curious, he straightens, throwing the withered bunch of leaves the sink.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ZIAT approaches the irregular stucco paste around the REPLACED STONES; runs his fingers along the ridges, noticing the paste is fresh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY snoring from fatigue. BELL wakes him quickly.
</DIRECTION>
<BELL>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
CUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY standing in a group of PRISONERS with BELL and MAX. He has a look of total despair on his face, as he watches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SINK. PRISONERS are everywhere jabbering excitedly among themselves. ZIAT is conferring with HAMIDOU as GUARDS rip out the last stone, revealing the HOLE leading to the SHAFT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY's gaze shifts to ZIAT fixing all his hatred on him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ZIAT grinning, moves away, and his falaka stick cocked like a sergeant major - moves among the prisoners.
</DIRECTION>
<HAMIDOU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMIDOU>
<DIRECTION>
They all fall immediately silent. HAMIDOU continues his walk among them, bypassing:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MAX who shifts his gaze onto:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY. HAMIDOU approaches, his eyes moving over BILLY with contempt, and shifting him aside with the stick. To him Billy is the same passive prisoner as before. He moves on, shifting OTHERS aside and then stops at:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BELL. HAMIDOU swings his stick up slowly and taps him lightly on the chest. BELL realizes and is afraid.
</DIRECTION>
<HAMIDOU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No do! No do! I tell you I see you again.. Finish!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMIDOU>
<DIRECTION>
He punctuates this last with a theatrical tap on the chest and he gestures to the GUARDS.
</DIRECTION>
<HAMIDOU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take him!

</HAMIDOU>
<DIRECTION>
BELL, already broken by bad beatings, shivers.

GUARDS grab him, hurry him out the Kogus behind HAMIDOU
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY holds himself rigid, trying not to break. Bell's PROTESTS continue OFF.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MAX unable to contain his anger, strides right up to ZIAT, collars him, livid.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You bastard! This time I'm gonna kick your fucking brains all over this kitchen!

<DIRECTION>
CUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MAX is at his BUNK that NIGHT; puts away the hypodermic needle, stoned and speeding at the same time, smoking a cigarette. BILLY inwardly tense, sits with his head in his hands.

BILLY looks away, not even considering. But MAX is caught up in the notion.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah I got it all worked out. Billy, listen to me.

CUT:

<DIRECTION>
THE BACK OF THE RADIO is unscrewed; the cover pulled off. EMPTY!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVE TO ZIAT. The look is as Billy expected. Horror, shock, anger, fear. ZIAT SCREAMS hysterically like old Greek widow and:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEATING HIS CHEST and tearing at his hair, ZIAT runs out of the KOGUS wailing, moaning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SECOND STORY KOGUS is being" controlled" by the GUARDS. WIDE ANGLE reveals a circus of clockwork destruction as the GUARDS, making abundant NOISE, systematically rip up each bunk, locker, mattress, picture, book, etc., their faces flushed with this opportunity for orgy.

ZIAT leaning in CLOSE, OVER THE STOVE in the KITCHEN, framed by GUARDS. It is the same crouched posture he always uses to work the stove but now his eyes show complete despair as he sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A THOUSAND SHREDS OF PAPER MONEY floating in his pots amid his withered tea bags. From ashes to ashes and dust to dust.

ZIAT folds his head into his hands, sobbing then wailing very human, very sad.

Just as:

ZIAT enters the kitchen; he eyes Max with hatred, sits at the other TABLE and orders tea. Surprisingly, he is wearing a suit and clean shirt-unlike his usual grimy appearance.

BILLY, looking shaken, enters the kitchen, glances at ZIAT sits with MAX.

<DIRECTION>
Lunges.

ZIAT is bulky, throws the smaller BILLY off and scrambles past a bunk.

BILLY is up and after him. Jumps back as a SHIV cuts the air in front of him. His side is cut.
</DIRECTION>

ZIAT holding the shiv, feints, cursing BILLY in Turkish.

<DIRECTION>
BILLY skips back, takes a MATTRESS off the bed and runs it right into KNOCKING HIM AND THE WHOLE BUNK OVER.

<DIRECTION>
BILLY beats him around the head but though the blood now flows and teeth are broken, is like a clumsy bear, hard to kill.

ZIAT thuds onto the floor.

<DIRECTION>
A STRUGGLING KISS ensues.

ZIAT - CLOSE in terror; throat cords rippling; eyes bulging with disbelief, body quivering, mouth open and screaming, but it is a SILENT SCREAM and the mouth is a dark hole filled with blood and without a TONGUE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY, without a moment's mercy, crashes his fist into ZIAT'S face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ZIAT his strength now broken, collapses on his back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY crashes his fist again into the hated face. He is GRABBED now by a GUARD, but:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE - BILLY shakes the GUARD OFF, then as ANOTHER GUARD runs up, BILLY SLAMS him aside and, obsessed, lunges back down on ZIAT and
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOTH HANDS CLAMPED TOGETHER high in the air delivers a final blow to ZIAT'S face. The bones shatter. Pause. His ogre unconscious beneath him, BILLY, now in SLOW MOTION, EXTENDS HIS ARMS IN THE AIR - in the fighter's victory gesture, and his eyes glow with the fever in them, and with his mouth and face bloodied, he looks like a savage. No longer Billy Hayes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHARP CUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY bound in a thick leather belt (a kiyis) which screws tightly around the waist and cinches the hands together, is being HAULED in continuing SLOW MOTION through a huge DOOR somewhere in one of the cavernous corridors of the prison.The door is approximately NINE FEET by SIX FEET, strong and wooden with a circular iron handle which one of the GUARDS now pulls open; a GLIMPSE of darkness within.

THE DOOR CLOSES. SUPERIMPOSE:

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MAX, barely recognizable in a torn sheet and with a blackened face, comes rushing into a crowded ROOM, screaming louder than any other inmate. marks on his face, He is enraged, blood dripping from scratch ATTENDANTS in white smocks chase him over the beds. Max is yelling in Turkish.

	Hamidou! Get Hamidou! Get the Kiyisl!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ATTENDANTS>
<DIRECTION>
The ATTENDANTS wrestle with him, but he throws them off, tearing around the room mindlessly. In the process we see that not much attention is paid him because everybody else is crazy! There are 50 other LUNATICS yelling at each other in fights over sheets, blankets, beds, cigarettes, jumping: screaming, pushing, shoving; some babbling to themselves, rocking, crying, chanting, singing. Several of them (the craziest) are stark naked. some, wrapped in torn blackened sheets, patrol the room like quick ferrets, sharp eyes open for anything they can steal. Others move in meaningless, blank-eyed silence. The walls are filthy black and join the ceilings in arches rather than angles, giving the look of an old dungeon. Fifty beds are lined up right next to each other so that you walk right into your bed. A constant nerve-racking NOISE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HAMIDOU bursts into the ROOM, the angry look in his eyes spelling real trouble for Max. MOVE with him as he sweep sin on MAX and picks him up with one move and SMASHES HIM against the wall. Max hardly notices.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE - HAMIDOU takes the leather kiyis from an ATTENDANT, moves in on MAX and starts clamping it around him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AN ATTENDANT walks through the room with an apron containing several large pockets bulging with red, green, blue, white PILLS, which he distributes by the handful.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Hop! Hop! Hop! Full moon. Hop! Hop! Hop!

</ATTENDANT>
<DIRECTION>
THE LUNATICS gobble them up as if they were candy. In some of the clustered areas, nine lunatics occupy as little as three beds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MAX is tightly bound now by HAMIDOU, but his body arches against the bindings, his neck straining, his teeth snapping at the air. HAMIDOU grabs him with one hand by the leather waist, hauls him high up in the air and
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THROWS MAX half-ways across the room, MAX smashing heavily against some beds, continuing to SCREAM OFF as:

THE ATTENDANT with the pills-now bypasses BILLY on one of the beds.

<ATTENDANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hop! Hop! Full Moon - take your pills!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ATTENDANT>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY gobbles them up. He has changed. Lines in his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No smile, no sense of humor; a brooding silence about him, a straight ahead look. He pays no attention to MAX off; he is in grubby white pyjamas and shower sandals. Rolls back onto hi& bed with its filthy torn sheet, totally ignoring the surrounding commotion, and
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE - turning onto his shoulder, BILLY suddenly finds himself face to face with a dark saddened visage. The MAN is very young and stark naked but for an old black rag wrapped around his head and clutched under his chin. His eyes are yellow, the voice pleading.

BILLY, really aggravated now, springs up from the bed, and in the quirky way the mad and the eccentric adopt walks determinedly away from the young man, looking back to shake his head bizarrely at him one more time.
</DIRECTION>

ANOTHER ANGLE

<DIRECTION>
BILLY walking down the aisle bypasses MAX int he kiyis, rolling on the floor, still screaming in Turkish.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>

	Will you listen to me? PLEASE LISTEN TO ME!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
Several LUNATICS are gathered around tormenting him, one of them yanking on his penis as if it were made of rubber; another is playing with his ass. A third one, also in a leather kiyis, is leaning over MAX jabbering and drooling into his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MAX, more enraged by this than the other bodily offences, lunges up sharply and bites the man's FACE. SCREAMS, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY, paying no attention except for a brief disinterested glance, keeps going into:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SECOND ROOM. MORE LUNATICS. A screaming OLD MAN is chasing after another OLD MAN who has stolen his tespe beads, waving them back at the first old man who howls with rage, frantic to have his beads back. The second old man throws the beads to a THIRD OLD MAN who hops across the beds with the FIRST OLD MAN chasing him. BILLY intersects.

A LITTLE NERVOUS MAN stares into a broken pocket mirror fingering the large round carbuncle under his eye, trying to rub it away with little grimaces and flurries of nervous motion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO ATTENDANTS in smocks indifferently finish eating on a newspaper spread across one of the beds; they shake out the paper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHICKEN BONES, ORANGE PEELS hitting the floor. A flurry of movement, as the LUNATICS scuffle like rats over the left- overs. AD LIB curses, yells.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AN OLD MAN obscenely gestures to BILLY from his bed.

</OLD_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
His blackened teeth leer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY, seemingly immune to all of this in some private island of his own madness, walks in his determined way past a PARTITION to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CIRCULAR STONE STAIRCASE leading downwards, the stones damp, dark, slippery. BILLY continues with the same straight- ahead determination to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LONER LEVEL. at last BILLY's expression changes to almost childish relief, for here at last is the refuge he seeks the relative comfort and silence of THE WHEEL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a grim, squat PILLAR dominating the room and bearing the weight of the ceiling. And around it some SIXTY LUNATICS trudge slowly, near silently, in counter-clockwise flow. It is a hypnotic shuffle and BILLY blends right in, sliding easily into the sluggish, mindless river, his eyes hanging loosely on the floor, watching:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SOOTHING RHYTHM OF FEET shuffling at a comforting pace. These are the spokes of the wheel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO TINY BARE LIGHT-BULBS give faint, eerie illumination to the chamber. One one side, a pot-bellied stove flickers, etching the shadows of the walkers in a strange orange glow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOME LUNATICS, not walking, hover around the stove. OTHERS are jammed onto a low L-shaped wooden platform that runs the length of two walls. of these men are naked, covered with open running sores over their knees, elbows, buttocks. But they are much quieter than the upstairs crowd. They are the lowest order of madmen. They have no minds left. They are the damned.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY walks among them, expressionless. A tall, thin cadaverous TURK with a grizzled beard now shuffles up alongside BILLY, looks at him, walks with him. is about fifty, his pyjamas relatively clean, looking more sane than the average but his eyes are bright and scary and his wet hair is matted down on his head, and big clumps of it have been pulled out. He speaks with a cultured English accent.

BILLY doesn't notice, shuffles along.

BILLY pays no attention, keeps shuffling on. Glances at him, smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<AHMET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They won't let YOU go either.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AHMET>
<DIRECTION>
The smug certainty of his manner reaches some chord deep inside Billy, because Billy glances briefly at this lunatic who is smiling. Billy looks back at his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<AHMET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, they'll never let you go. They tell you they let you go but you stay. You never go from here.

BILLY plods on. grins and tries to explain the situation like a father lecturing a child.
</DIRECTION>
<AHMET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see we all come from a factory. Sometimes the factory makes bad machines that don't work. They put them here. The bad machines don't know they're bad machines, but the people at the factory know. They know one of the machines that doesn't work...

They walk on. Ahmet's expression changes.

He wraps his rags around himself quite carefully and we FOLLOW him out of the circle. He drops to his hands and knees and with a sense of dignity, crawls into the filthy blackness under the L-shaped wooden platform, disappearing like a cockroach.

BILLY plods on.

CUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AN OLD WHITE-BEARDED MADMAN the Hoja, grandiose in his rags, leads MUSLIM PRAYER in the first ROOM. Some of his followers have prayer mats, others a scrap of sheet or newspaper; their tones discordant, still pushing and shoving at each other during the prayer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO SPASTICS can't follow the routine of kneeling and bending; they tangle up absurdly and fall to the floor in a ball of arms and legs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FALAKA STICK pokes BILLY wake SOUND of the CHANTING fills room. It is evidently impossible to distinguish night from day because there are no windows.

ATTENDANTS poke the LUNATICS awake with their "clubs.

OTHER ATTENDANTS wrap an old DEAD LUNATIC with no teeth and foam on his open lips into a dirty sheet and haul him away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY amid the LUNATICS. We MOVE closer and closer to him, the head COUNT regressing. The room has become a torture cell - the NOISE LOUDER, LOUDER, closing in on Billy.

CUT:

<DIRECTION>
BILLY is led down a CORRIDOR by HAMIDOU into:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A VISITING room - Cabins are lined up like narrow wooden phone booths.
</DIRECTION>
<HAMIDOU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kabin on-yedi
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMIDOU>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY plods without interest to the specified cabin, closes the door, sits in the chair. No one is there. He waits - indifferent to any sense of time. Dirty two glass panes separate visitor and prisoner booths; bars are between the panes. An erratic microphone is the method of communication, giving a weird and distant aspect to the voice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HAMIDOU opens a small peep-hole in the cabin door, looks in unseen as:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TEE VISITOR DOOR opens and SUSAN tentatively walks in holding a large photo album; it takes several moments for her to react, and then her face shows the shock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY stares at her, his face rabid, decaying; if he remembers her even, he doesn't register it because she is a shock to him as well. Reality, the outside world all at once. His mind is spinning, unbalanced, unable to grasp it.

<DIRECTION>
The MICROPHONE makes her voice jarring, gagged. She looks silently. No sobbing, no big sad looks. Just shock. Shock of recognition, shock of time gone by.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY looking at her, his eyes moving down to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY P.O.V. - SUSAN, her neck, her breasts straining against the thin shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUSAN fingers the photo album nervously, speaking slow and distinct; not sure she is communicating.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Billy, your family is fine. Senator Buckley just made a special plea on your behalf in the Senate. Newsday has written several big articles about you. They've called you a pawn in the poppy game between Nixon and the Turks. The letters are coming in, Billy. People care....
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSAN>
<DIRECTION>
Stops, shakes her head. It sounds all wrong in this context.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY is still staring at her breasts. He hasn't seen a woman for five years and now a hungry animal look comes into his eyes He moves suddenly pressing up against the glass, rabid. And in Turkish:

<BILLY>
<DIRECTION>

His voice is savage, demanding.

A strange look in his eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUSAN slowly, scared, begins to unbutton her shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HAMIDOU looks on silently, does nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY follows every movement with wild-eyed lust.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUSAN leans up close to the window. With both hands on the front of her blouse, she slowly draws it apart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY going wild! Against the window. His hand down in his pyjamas.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HER BREASTS spring free, quivering, full and ripe with a deep cleavage and hard dark nipples. They hang full and loose. FULL SCREEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY'S EYES - FULL SCREEN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY beats on the window, working his mouth soundlessly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUSAN is shattered, scared of Billy's sanity.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh Billy, Billy, I wish I could make it better for you. Please don't... don't...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSAN>
<DIRECTION>
Tears. Fear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY tightens dramatically and comes right in his pants, slumps against the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUSAN realizes he has come, surprised.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY looks at her. Furtive, animal shame. And suddenly he starts to cry. A flood of feelings locked up too long come pouring out. He murmurs some words, Turkish SOUNDS sputtering out in his throat, then:
</DIRECTION>
<BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	S.... Susan?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<DIRECTION>
Softly, working his mouth finding it hard to speak.

SUSAN yearning. Tears sprinkling her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Billy?
	</DIALOGUE>

BILLY straining, not out of physical weakness but an emotional one. Sputters, eyes closed.

<BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I love you....

It sounds pathetic, lost.

Remembers something. Grabs the PHOTO ALBUM with all her strength, holding it up for him to see through the glass.Then remembering herself, looks around the room to make sure they're alone and in a contained voice:

<SUSAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Billy, your father gave me this for you. There's pictures of your Mom and Dad...Rob...Peg...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSAN>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY looks at it listlessly.

<DIRECTION>
HIS P.V.O - SUSAN holding the album open to PICTURES of his MOTHER and FATHER in front of the house, ROB on a bicycle, PEG in her cheer-leading outfit.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And there's pictures in the back of your old Mr. Franklin. Remember him... From the bank?

A certain tone slips into her voice.

<SUSAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's over in Greece now. He bought a ticket.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSAN>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY looks from the album to Susan. Possibly there is a gleam of understanding in his eyes but it is very faint. An Attendant BANGS on Susan's door, OFF.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Visiting is over.

SUSAN quickly puts the album away as if it were a hidden weapon.

<DIRECTION>
Pause. Silence. She closes her eyes, in pain; she doesn't think she has reached him. She turns to go, resigned.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY looking at her. Behind him HAMIDOU opens the door. A calm and cunning look on his face, glancing with Billy towards

A BRIEF GLIMPSE of SUSAN looking back, the album under her arm. The door closes.

CUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY, with the same deadened expression as before, comes down the STAIRS towards THE WHEEL. It is early morning and the walkers haven't started yet. Billy looks at the Pillar a dire look of reflection passing over his eyes. Then he starts walking but in a clockwise motion, opposite the normal pattern; in the same methodical manner as before.
</DIRECTION>

BILLY, on the inner track, passes TWO LUNATICS who are walking counter-clockwise. They glare at him, motion for him to turn around. Billy just keeps walking.

<DIRECTION>
More LUNATICS join the flow, gesturing or grunting at BILLY.

<DIRECTION>
BILLY STOPS, turns, looks at the rest of them slogging in the usual direction, looks as if he 'sees' them; and he walks out of the wheel, towards the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AHMET curious about his unusual behavior, follows BILLY.

BILLY stops and turns to look at AHMET. His eyes glint with special knowledge and he takes AHMET into his confidence using the latter's tone of voice:

BILLY in his BED. The usual UPROAR. THE ATTENDANT comes by with the pills, offers a handful to BILLY.

He takes them, puts a few into his mouth, swallows. Reflective, unsure. A RADIO playing OFF blares suddenly with the U.S. Armed Forces Station - JANIS JOPLIN singing "Take another piece of my heat now, Baby" then it's switched back to a TURKISH STATION, loud. Billy rises.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY enters the TOILET with the PHOTO ALBUM tightly clutched under his arm. A dark stone room, very shadowy. Piles of waste on the floor. A vacant-eyed barefoot LUNATIC shuffles past BILLY who goes to one of the four partitioned HOLES cut into the floor.

ANOTHER ANGLE - BILLY squats over it and with his filthy long nails he starts to slit open the back binder of the album Susan gave him. Flickering shadows. He looks up absently.

<DIRECTION>
THE LUNATICS, petrified, scatter off but ONE LUNATIC skids in a puddle of urine and crashes onto the tile howling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY slits open the binder to reveal TEN HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS with Pictures of Mr. Franklin' neatly inserted.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY has no particular expression on his face. Reflective, staring at the money; he looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LARGE SILHOUETTE is moving towards him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY just watches, transfixed, not trying to hide the money.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HAMIDOU comes into a faint light, looking down at him; glances at the money. Shakes his head gently.
</DIRECTION>
<HAMIDOU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No do! No do!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMIDOU>
<DIRECTION>
Reaches for and:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE - HAMIDOU takes the money from BILLY like candy from a baby, then takes him by the ear and slowly lifts him up. Billy is like a vegetable in his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<HAMIDOU>
<DIRECTION>
(in his broken English)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I tell you I see 'gain...

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I take you down to bath and your feet be big like...Breasts
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a gesture)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HAMIDOU leads BILLY roughly out of the lunatic room, pulling him by the ear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HAMIDOU still Pulling BILLY by the ear, guides him through the GUARD QUARTERS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HAMIDOU leads him up a narrow winding flight of STAIRS.
</DIRECTION>
<HAMIDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First you make mistake with Ziat, now you make mistake with money. You're not a new Prisoner, Vilyum Hi-yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMIDO>
<DIRECTION>
The tone of his voice indicates a severe reckoning this time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HAMIDOU pulls BILLY by the ear into a large echoing BATH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY looking, bent over by the ear - a hint of awareness of new surroundings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE - the BATH is deserted, spooky with greenish Yellow fish light flittering down from holes in ceiling around damp mossy arches. Steam rises off a bath. Benches, buckets of water. HAMIDOU swings BILLY around until he is facing him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HAMIDOU makes an elaborate gesture of putting aside his falaka stick and holstered gun; he will use his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<HAMIDOU>
<DIRECTION>
(shakes his head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've been in prison too long, Vilyum Hi-yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMIDOU>
<DIRECTION>
He takes that: stiff arm all the way back to its full arc and WHACKS BILLY up against the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY bounces back off the wall. The print of Hamidou's fingers is imbedded like a flaring white rainbow in the redness of his left cheek. SLAM - a backhanded whack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY bounces right back from the wall. steadies him.
</DIRECTION>
<HAMIDOU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You go crazy here Vilyum Hi-yes. Many people go crazy here. Best thing for crazy people is this...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMIDOU>
<DIRECTION>
THE BLOW, in SLOW MOTION comes sailing into:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY, and we see the brief boxer's distortion of all his face as he flies upwards and back into:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BENCH smashing it. Echo like jarring F.X.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY is held up by the PAJAMAS, steadied. The Turkish words seem far away, incomprehensible.
</DIRECTION>
<HAMIDOU>
<DIRECTION>
(OFF)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vilyum Hi-yes. You die here, Hi- yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMIDOU>
<DIRECTION>
WHACK - ANOTHER BLOW, but:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HAMIDOU this time holds onto the pajamas using Billy like a punching bag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHACK - A REVERSE BLOW.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HAMIDOU increasingly excited.
</DIRECTION>
<HAMIDOU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Babba sikijam! I fuck your mother, I fuck your sister...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMIDOU>
<DIRECTION>
WHACK - ANOTHER BLOW in SLOW MOTION
</DIRECTION>
<HAMIDOU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I fuck your father, I fuck your brother...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMIDOU>
<DIRECTION>
RIP! - a loud SOUND as HAMIDOU moves with a blur of speed, and shreds BILLY's pajamas with his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY naked, totally passive, semiconscious. HAMIDOU suddenly shifts position and snaps Billy into a strenuous wrestling hold across his knee on the steamy floor. He loosens him up by cracking his bones along his back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HAMIDOU - sweat pouring off his face, excited.
</DIRECTION>
<HAMIDOU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...And I fuck your grandmother and I fuck your pretty girlfriend...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
And I fuck you Hi-yes!)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bizarre otherworldly scene. This man is dredging Billy through a sadistic imagination sparked by the steam, the sweat, and an ethnic identification with a Turkish steam bath as a bedroom. He loosens his hold abruptly, rises, moves off as:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY holds himself on his knees, head sunk on his chest, gasping for breath, about to vomit. Pause; he looks up horrified at:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HAMIDOU pouring fresh buckets of water on the floor. SSSSSSSSSS! The awakened STEAM coils like a snake into every cranny of the little room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLURRED VISUALS - HAMIDOU stripping his shirt off. A huge muscular flash of chest,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BELT being snapped open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY waiting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FIGURE moving through the steam, closer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY backing away from it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STEAM - a glint of a FACE coming through. HAMIDOU - his eyes so intense they seem to burn off the steam like sun cutting haze. Then disappear again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY pulls back. A pause. Silence. Cat and mouse. Then very suddenly:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HAND reaches out of the STEAM and GRABS BILLY by the hair. A GRUNT, OFF.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY his eyes moving fast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FLASH of a huge darkened penis, fully erect cutting forward into the steam like a from drill, detached from the rest of the body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SOUND - grotesque and so sudden after the silence it jars the senses. A BLURRED VISUAL then:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY Launching forward in SLOW MOTION, desperation distorting his features and:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STEAM - then BILLY'S HEAD SLAMS through it in SLOW MOTION and:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SMASHES the penis with its skull. A horrifying GASP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLURRED VISUALS - STEAM - HAMIDOU staggering CLOSE - surprise, pain...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY MOVING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FOOT coming up fast through the steam, connecting again with the genitals. Another SCREAM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BODY hitting the tiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY groping for the falaka stick. Raises it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A STRUGGLE - Two bodies thrashing, one of them screaming now in pain. A definitive sound then a THWACK! Another thwack! The steam seems to clear and
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY is on top of the gigantic HAMIDOU smashing him with the falaka stick with all his might.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HAMIDOU is in contortions, his nose busted and bleeding.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His HAND gripping BILLY by the neck, forcing him back and strangling him at the same time. Billy is red in the face, such is the force of this creature but continues to beat him, harder, harder. His expression filled with a life energy, seeded in hatred, that he thought he had lost. Again, Again -
</DIRECTION>
<BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Babba sikijam, Hamidu! I fuck your Mother, I fuck your daughter, I fuck your sons, I fuck your wife!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<DIRECTION>
The BAND slips from his throat, then springs up desperately again and clenches Billy's whole face with one gigantic palm, clawing to get in, then just as quickly slips away. BILLY beats on - again, again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLOOD flows fast in agitated swirls into the little pool.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY opens a door gently, moves across an empty CORRIDOR, dressed in and gun in intense. Hamidou's holster. large uniform with his He looks shaken, weak, falaka stick dizzy but

BILLY starts, clenches the falaka stick ready to spring, spins.

A LITTLE SHOESHINE BOY is his case down the corridor.

BILLY has not seen a child in a long time. get words out, then manages: Surprised. Can't get the words out, then manages:

	No!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<DIRECTION>
THE KID shrugs, moves on, looking At Billy strangely.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY goes up a flight of STAIRS. Ahead, VOICES passing. He stops. Goes on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY goes through an empty GUARD QUARTERS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY is in another CORRIDOR, approaches
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SMALL PORTAL, daylight at its edges. Locked?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY, tense, tries it. It swings open on:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAYLIGHT!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY squints. Adjusting to the harsh sensation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AN ISTANBUL STREET - TRAFFIC, SOUNDS. TWO GUARDS approaching the portal in the distance, drinking soda pop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY steps back, straightens his clothes, steps out briskly and at such an angle that
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE TWO GUARDS don't notice him in the traffic as they enter the open portal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LONG SHOT - BILLY walking down the street, looking back, almost bewildered, not quiet believing this.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT - RAILROAD TICKET being stamped. SOUND - SNAP. MOVE UP to TICKET CLERK behind a grill.

<VOICE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Edirne to Uzun Kopru?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
THE CLERK looks puzzled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY is on the other side of the grill. A ill-fitting new Western style suit, a hat over his dyed black hair; totally paranoid. He hasn't slept in three days and the bruises from the Hamidou beating now show clearly black and blue on his face. His eyes are alert, darting around, his speech clipped and to the point.
</DIRECTION>
<BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the matter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<DIRECTION>
THE CLEF!! Shrugs.
</DIRECTION>
<CLERK>

<DIRECTION>
BILLY Moves off a small provincial RAILROAD DEPOT - DAY. He looks at the:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EMPTY TRACKS - No 'midnight express'.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY, tenser than ever, uses the occasion of buying a newspaper at an OUTDOOR STAND to study:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE MAIN SQUARE of the VILLAGE (EDIRNE) - DAY. SOLDIERS and POLICE are abundant, chattering bustling amid tanks and half-tracks. Mountains can be seen in the far distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY camouflages his face as best he can in the Newspaper "Hurriyet" studying:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CABDRIVERS in the Main Square. Most of them are older, grizzled looking standing next to their old battered dusty cabs talking with stray SOLDIERS. Billy's eyes settle on a YOUNGER DRIVER with longish hair, possibly an ally.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY glances down at his newspaper as a SOLDIER intersects and his expression goes stony as he sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FULL COLOR DRAWING (first page) of a ridiculously fierce heavy-muscled barechested MAN beating a facsimile of Hamidou into the ground. Next to it a blurry badly reproduced photograph of BILLY with a superimposed GUN in his hand. You can't really tell it's him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY, controlling himself, crumples up the newspaper into a baton, his eyes everywhere. Be the darting A crosses square.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE - BILLY, intersecting a POLICEMAN who glances at him, joins the YOUNG CABDRIVER..
</DIRECTION>
<BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, I have Swedish friends camping south of the town. I was supposed to meet them here this morning but I was late. Can you take me there?

	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<BILLY>

	<DIALOGUE>
	About ten kilometers.

<BILLY>
<DIRECTION>
(OFF)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<DIRECTION>
THE DRIVER, noticing Billy's look at the soldiers, gets in the cab.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY climbs into the back seat, feeling already he has made a mistake. There is something too alert, too hard in this young driver.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY P.O.V. - THE MOUNTAINS as they roll in the taxi. FORESTS - FIELDS.

	How'd you lose your friends?

</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY leaning back in his seat, casual.
</DIRECTION>
<BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I drank a lot of raka last night in Istanbul. Got into a fight.

</BILLY>
<DIRECTION>
Indicates the bruises on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DRIVER looking at him in the rear view mirror. His curiosity narrowing.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How come you speak Turkish so good?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY casually glances out the window.
</DIRECTION>
<BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did twenty months in prison in Istanbul. Hash
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<DIRECTION>
THE DRIVER studies BILLY in the rear-view mirror. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to score some? Cheap?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY looks at him hard. Something's wrong with this man.
</DIRECTION>
<BILLY>
<DIRECTION>
(curt)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<DIRECTION>
Cutting off further conversation, he looks out at:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE MOUNTAINS of Greece - with longing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY stares back at:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE DRIVER whose eyes now move away from the rear-view mirror under the pressure of the stare. SOUND OFF loud machinery.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY turning - in rear window, we see a TURKISH HALFTRACK pulling alongside the cab, SOLDIERS waving their arms for the cabdriver to get out of the way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE - the HALFTRACK pulls level. The CABDRIVER slows down, with a curse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY - beads of sweat trickle his brow
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE PERSONNEL CARRIER, disinterested, pulls past.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY breathes heavily with nervous relief.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAB pulls up to the end of a dirt road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY has his MAP out, studying it.
</DIRECTION>
<BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Maritas River? Where is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE - the DRIVER, exasperated, waves southwest.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two miles! Minefields over there. Do you know where this campground is or not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not far. Just a little way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! I'm not going any further! It'll wreck my car.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll pay extra
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How much?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE - BILLY slips him fifty lira. The DRIVER takes it, muttering under his breath, jams the cab into gear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAB follows rutted tracks into low HILLS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR CAB - very bumpy.
</DIRECTION>
<BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are the minefields?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All over. Turkish Army up there. It's against the law. They shoot us.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looks up in the mirror)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sure you looking for your friends, man?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY(VERY SHARP NOW) (very sharp now)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay! Ley me out right here. I'm getting tired of all this bullshit from you. I'll walk it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
(looks back, then
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	ahead, suddenly
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
brightening)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, look! they probably know where the campers are
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY's entire expression changes. It is all over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A TANK AND HALFTRACK are sitting there by the rutted track, with SOLDIERS. And a little LEAN-TO with several POLICE. Also a couple of attack DOGS on leashes. The Driver honks his horn on the approach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey officer, we're looking for the campground. Do you know where it is?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE - TWO POLICEMEN and A SOLDIER come sauntering over, their collars open, beer bottles in hand, slightly drunk.
</DIRECTION>
<POLICEMAN>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's a tourist, what do you want, he says he's looking for friends at the campground.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
FIRST POLICEMAN glances BILLY
</DIRECTION>
<POLICEMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Campground?

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never heard of one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POLICEMAN>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seen any Swedish foreigners in a camper-bus?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
SECOND POLICEMAN meanwhile eases his arm down on the OPEN WINDOW bringing BILLY into foreground. The COP'S mouth is open and exhaling a wave of beer breath over-BILLY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY P.O.V. - BEER FACE FOCUS PAST him to SOLDIER at tank reading "Hurriyet" - the picture of BILLY on page one, spread for all to see.

BILLY motions to the DRIVER.

<BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, they haven't seen him, let's go back to town, it's getting late.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<DIRECTION>
THE DRIVER ignores it. Calls out again, louder to BEER FACE.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Foreigners! KAMPER. VOLKSWAGEN
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY rigid. This asshole of a driver!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEER FACE glances at BILLY, pulls his head out the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looks down the road. Takes a sip of beer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOLDIER, disinterested, moves back towards the tank.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEER FACE looks in the other direction down the road, burps.Very conscious of his authority, shakes his head without looking at the driver. Moves away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY nudges the DRIVER.
</DIRECTION>
<BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, let's go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<DIRECTION>
THE DRIVER impatiently turns and looks straight at BILLY, aware of his anxiety.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is no Volkswagen, man! Something wrong with you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY hardening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DRIVER calling out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEER FACE turns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DRIVER leans out the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This guy's fishy...I think he might be trying to get to Greece.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY looks around fast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEER FACE starts back lazily, half drunk, with the OTHER POLICEMAN

<DIRECTION>
DRIVER
</DIRECTION>

</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes grow big suddenly As he sees the barrel of Hamidou's REVOLVER right in His cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY all business, very quiet.
</DIRECTION>
<BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get out -- right now, move!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<DIRECTION>
BEER-FACE advancing looks puzzled, thinks he sees something, then crouches as:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DRIVER gets out the door crouching, yells.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's got a gun!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY firing SHOTS off to distract them has climbed over the front seat, jams the cab into gear. It stalls! Again he tries, and now shoots off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAB Roars past the roadblock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE COPS AND SOLDIER, scattered by the shots, now scream at each other. They run. SHOTS are fired.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY guns the cab down the road, flying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOUDS OF DUST trail the cab.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE TANK starts to roll after it. Full speed. The HALFTRACK follows, the MEN riding it shouting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY looks back, then looking ahead sees something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
P.O.V - a speck in the far distance. Another ROADBLOCK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY decides, then -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAB swerves right off the road and jumps into the gently rolling FIELD on the border of the road, pock marked with HILLS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE TURKS come roaring down the road, pointing to the cab.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOW ANGLE - the TANK makes a flat out stop, gears grinding.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE GUN TURRET swings left.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAB in the far distance, at an angle to the tank, starts running up an incline.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE TANK FIRES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
P.O.V. - SHELL BLASTS WIDE OF THE CAB.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY, startled, looks back, guns for the top of the incline.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS P.O.V. - ANOTHER SHELL now blasts to his front right, closer. Something heavy (shrapnel) thuds into the rood of the cab.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY drives all out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
P.O.V. - THE INCLINE CLOSER, CLOSER, ABOUT TO MAKE IT, THEN: A BLAST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TANK P.O.V. - the CAB spinning in the blast of the adjacent shell-burst.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY, shaken but unhurt, staggers out of the cab, looks:

<DIRECTION>
P.O.V. - A WHEEL BLASTED AWAY, FUEL PISSING OUT FROM THE SHRAPNEL HOLES, SMASHED WINDSHIELD AND FENDER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE TURKS are coming up the incline now, like the Cavalry -- some on foot running, others on the HALFTRACK. BULLETS whistle and pop nearby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY running. He tears off his jacket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOLDIERS pass the wrecked car, at the top of the incline shouting, pointing and firing at
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ONE SOLDIER seems lighter than the others and takes off in a sprint as the OTHERS follow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE HALFTRACK now crests the incline and gathering full gear and momentum, roars off down the slope after Billy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE BILLY running sweat all over him. In background, the HALFTRACK and running FIGURES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY runs into a high dry cornfield with the sun starting to set ahead of him in the Greek mountains.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOUNTAINS - must make those mountains.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY running all out - eyes fixed on them, breathing, skipping heartbeats.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE PERSONNEL CARRIER bypasses the FAST SOLDIER who slows down, panting. Billy has outrun him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OTHER SOLDIERS run up in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY, tireless, obsessed, runs right into a POPPY FIELD.It is a splendid beautiful scarlet red, set off by the dipping rays of the sun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS FEET smashing down the poppy plants. Fast - THUCK! THUCK! THUCK! THUCK! THUCK! THUCK!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CROSSCUT the metal TREADS of the Halftrack into the poppy, mowing down entire rows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO SOLDIERS on the PERSONNEL CARRIER are waving encouragement to the driver inside. They have him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE the HALFTRACK closing the distance on BILLY now thirty yards apart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY looking back, starting to fade. Huge wheezing gasps of breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOLDIERS running up looking at
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE HALFTRACK in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOLDIERS yell.
</DIRECTION>
<SOLDIERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Minefield! Minefield! Come back! Stop!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(NO SUBTITLE)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY runs out of the POPPY FIELD into a THIN FOREST.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SOLDIERS screaming in the distance, jumping up and down waving for the halftrack to come back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOW ANGLE - the HALFTRACK with the waving SOLDIERS on board now blasts out of the poppy field at full speed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY -- he has no chance, In immediate background is the fast HALFTRACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ONE SOLDIER on the HALFTRACK now looking back to the SHOUTS of his comrades. Confused. Turns bout back to yell something and:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ENORMOUS EXPLOSION The HALFTRACK disintegrates in a tank landmine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY thrown to the ground by the force of the blast, looks back, GASPS!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BURNING WRECKAGE. Black spirals of smoke. Secondary explosions.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY stumbles up. A gash of blood is on his temple but he doesn't know it or feel it such is his stress. He runs on, SHOTS whistling towards him from the poppy field.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TURKISH OFFICER screaming angrily at Billy, cursing, shaking his fist at the sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY, in the forest, is totally out of breath and out of eyesight of the pursuers. He stops against a tree. FROG SOUNDS. The gurgle of water. Muddy ground. He looks:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE MARITAS RIVER rushing ahead. A strong current.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY peels off all his clothing except his pants, not delaying one more moment. He feels he must keep going. And he's right. DOGS are barking OFF.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SNARLING ATTACK DOG is tearing through the minefield, fast, ahead of the others.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY looks, sees it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THIRTY YARDS - the huge DOG coming right at him!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY runs for the edge of the bank and plunges in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE ATTACK DOG sprints up to the edge of the river bank and without a moment's hesitation, plunges right in after him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY lashing into the current with a fierce breast stroke, is swept downstream kicking futilely.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE DOG, its jaws open and clacking, is also swept down river.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY going under, coming back up - fighting, still fighting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE DOG struggling sails past as
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY hauls himself out of the river, going in a circle, dizzy. Falls. Struggles up again. Looks back. Must keep going. Must.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BASE OF' MOUNTAIN - hilly, rugged.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY runs, drags, runs again. He is a lamentable sight - naked except for ripped wet pants, barefoot, bleeding, muddied. Dimly he makes out:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FARMHOUSE - TWILIGHT. Some cows, goats, chickens. NO sign of people.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY staggers towards it. Wears something. A rooting SOUND. Stops. Something familiar about it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FAMILY OF PIGS snort and root in the mud, little piglets running around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY staggers towards them, muttering to himself.
</DIRECTION>
<BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pigs...! Pigs...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<DIRECTION>
Then yells in the recognition of it
</DIRECTION>
<BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pigs... You... Beautiful...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY BILLY falls to his knees in the confined pen; the pigs run around squealing. Trying to reach out for one of them, he falls face first into the mud and lies there. Pause. A wooden DOOR squeaks open OFF. BILLY slowly turns his muddy eyes over his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY P.O.V. - TWO SOLDIERS, khaki-colored uniforms, helmets, olive faces, mustaches, approach cautiously from the farmhouse, rifles ready. Following them is an OLD FARMER, Further behind in the doorway is his WIFE and CHILDREN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY muttering to himself, in Turkish.
</DIRECTION>
<BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Greek?... Greek?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<DIRECTION>
THE SOLDIERS approach close, stand above this strange figure, look at each other.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
(It sounded like Turkish)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY with dimming strength.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FARMER understands, makes a vigorous nod of his head.
</DIRECTION>
<FARMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Malisee...Ellada!

CAR DOOR SLAMS SHUT - and BILLY, his movements still weak, moves a few steps from the car and stops. SUBTITLE:

<DIRECTION>
:SC: OCTOBER 24, 1975 - BABYLON, LONG ISLAND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Framing Billy are SUSAN and his FATHER, both silent. They look with him at
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS SISTER, BROTHER, UNCLE, AUNT, SISTER-In-LAW FAMILY FRIEND - AND GRANDMOTHER, all on the porch of the ordinary house in BABYLON, LONG ISLAND - DAY; all of them returning his gaze in that first SILENT moment. Curiosity. Recognition. Shock. Love.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then they move. But we don't hear their movements. It is SOUNDLESS reunion; the SISTER running out first in SLOW MOTION, the MOTHER following last, crying; the GRANDMOTHER too infirm to move, the shaking her head from side to side in SLOW MOTION, her tears lost somewhere in the wrinkles of her face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY surrounded by FAMILY - SLOW MOTION - SOUNDLESS. His eyes flooding. All the feelings in him. And deep inside - a solitary question.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EPILOGUE BLACK SCREEN - SUPERIMPOSE:

THE CHARACTER NAMED BELL IS STILL INSIDE.

And OVER this, the SOUND of a PASSING TRAIN rushing by in the night - UP, FAST and AWAY.
