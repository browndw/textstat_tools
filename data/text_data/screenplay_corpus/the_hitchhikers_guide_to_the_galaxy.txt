	The second most intelligent creatures were, of course, dolphins who curiously enough had long known of the impending destruction of the planet Earth. They had made many attempts to alert mankind to the danger, but most of their communications were misinterpreted as amusing attempts to punch footballs or whistle for tidbits, so they eventually decided they would leave Earth by their own means.

	In many of the more relaxed civilizations on the Outer Eastern Rim of the Galaxy, the Hitchhiker's Guide has already supplanted the great Encyclopedia Galactica as the standard repository of all knowledge and wisdom. For though it has many omissions, and contains much which is apocryphal, or at least wildly inaccurate, it scores over the older, more pedestrian work in two important respects. First, it is slightly cheaper. And second, it has the words "DON'T PANIC" printed in large friendly letters on its cover.

	You know, it's at times like this, when I'm trapped in a Vogon airlock with a man from Betelgeuse and about to die of asphyxiation in deep space that I really wish I'd listened to what my mother told me when I was young.

Ford dabs Arthur's brow. They stare forward at the airlock door. Long pause. Nothing happens. They look to each other. Shrug. They might be okay. Then -- PSSH. The bottom drops out. They're sucked down and out.

Ford and Arthur spin away from the ship, holding their breath. The guide slips out of Arthur's pocket.

<GUIDE_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Space..." says the introduction to the Hitchhikers Guide, "...is big. Really big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the market, but that's just peanuts compared to space..." and so on.

	It also says that if you hold a lung full of air you can survive in the total vacuum of space for about thirty seconds -- but with space being really big and all, the chances of being picked up within that time are 2 to the power of 2076775949 to 1 against...

He reaches for the phone, it's just beyond his fingertips. His eyes widen with fret as the phone tumbles away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then -- WOOMPH -- space seems to stretch and bend. A tiny hole appears, then opens wide. Paper hats and party balloons fall out, then drift away. The hole flips inside out. Arthur and Ford are enveloped, then replaced by a stunning, sleek starship, the HEART OF GOLD.

	<DIALOGUE>
	So you carved it up?

</FORD>
<ZAPHOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes -- I think. And I think I did it in such a way that it wouldn't be detected by the Government screening tests -- or by me. So, what's so secret that I can't let anybody know I know it, not the Galactic Government, not even myself? And the answer is--

Improbability Drive Effect -- as the ship flips across space and disappears, leaving nothing but shimmers.
</DIRECTION>
<GUIDE_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Infinite Improbability Drive is a new method of crossing vast interstellar distances without all that tedious mucking about in hyperspace. As soon as the drive reaches Infinite Improbability, it passes through every conceivable point in every conceivable Universe almost simultaneously, then selects the appropriate re-entry point. The principle of generating small amounts of finite improbability by hooking the logic circuits of a Bambleweeny 57 Sub- Meson Brain to an atomic vector plotter suspended in a strong Brownian Motion producer, say a nice hot cup of tea, were of course well understood.

Zaphod heads for the "To Design Department" stone. Trillian and Ford follow.

Zaphod feels around it, looking for a switch, a knob, anything. He must've hit something because the front of the stone suddenly slides open revealing a SWIRLING VORTEX THAT LOOKS LIKE A JET ENGINE.

And she takes off running for the door. Suicide? Bravery?

<DIRECTION>
They turn just in time to see her jump into the vortex. She YELPS as her body is bent in half, twisted like a rung mop, then sucked inside.

Arthur is horrified, literally gasping for air. Ford is semi-impressed. Zaphod, unfazed.

Arthur finally gets his legs to move, steps up -- but hesitates at the threshold, paralyzed with fear, unable to take a step. Then -- FFSSSSH - the door seals shut.

Arthur sits with his back against the stone, staring across the field at the beautiful double sunset.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL -- Ford is hesitantly aiming the gun at Zaphod.

Ford reluctantly pulls the trigger. CLICK.

She take the gun from him.
</DIRECTION>
<TRILLIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A gun that makes people suddenly see things from your point of view. Useful tool for the deranged evangelist trying to convert the masses, eh?

She starts walking.

<ZAPHOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why so edgy?

She can't believe he's asking this. She aims the gun, CLICK!

<ZAPHOD>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)

	Of course you're edgy, your planet's been blown up and you've been tooling around the Galaxy with the guy who signed the order

CLICK. She shoots him again.

<ZAPHOD>

	<DIALOGUE>
	You actually wanted to know the Question because you always thought there was more to life, and now you're crushed because you find out there really isn't.

	You've got no home, no family, no one to be with -- and you're stuck with me, another in a long line of men who doesn't appreciate you because he's too busy appreciating himself.

</ZAPHOD>
<DIRECTION>
Hearing this puts a lump in her throat, causes her eyes to well with tears. She lowers the gun.

Zaphod shakes his head -- the effect wearing off. But he realizes what he said and doesn't like it.

Arthur turns and looks. There before him is...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
O1a EARTH -- Arthur is thunderstruck...then confused. 101a
</DIRECTION>
<ARTHUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So -- it wasn't destroyed?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARTHUR>
<SLARTIBARTFAST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, it was. This is a back-up. Earth Mark II.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SLARTIBARTFAST>
<ARTHUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you're saying you ... made the Earth?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARTHUR>
<SLARTIBARTFAST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, not me alone. It was a group effort. I did my part, though. Ever heard of a place, I think it's called Norway?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SLARTIBARTFAST>
<DIRECTION>
Arthur nods. The cart pushes through the clouds, towards Ayers Rock. A GUY ON A LADDER is painting it it's familiar red color. Some of it is still primer grey.

	That was one of mine. Won an award you know. Lovely crinkly edges. I was sorry to hear about it being blown up. Shocking cock up. The mice were furious.

<ARTHUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mice? Who cares about bloody mice?

JUMP CUT. They move through a forest where a man presses a lever making several MUSHROOMS pop up on the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<SLARTIBARTFAST>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Earthman, you must realize that the planet you lived on was commissioned, paid for, and run by mice. It was destroyed shortly before the completion of the purpose for which it was built. Ten minutes later, we would have been free and clear. But we gave them our standard ten million year warranty and they have come here to retrieve this back-up copy. And they've brought you with them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SLARTIBARTFAST>
<DIRECTION>
The transport cart flies out of forest toward the ocean.
</DIRECTION>
<ARTHUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They brought...I'm sorry, when you say "mice" do you mean the little white furry creatures with the cheese fixation?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARTHUR>
<SLARTIBARTFAST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These creatures you call "mice" are merely the protrusion into our dimension of hyper- intelligent pan-dimensional beings. The whole business with the cheese must've been a front. They were experimenting on you, you see. A vast computer program...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SLARTIBARTFAST>
<ARTHUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah. I see where you're confused. You see -- we were experimenting on them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARTHUR>
<DIRECTION>
Over the ocean, a "Perfect Storm" wave rolls toward them.
</DIRECTION>
<SLARTIBARTFAST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I gather they arranged for you to conduct some primitively staged experiments so they could prod your thinking here and there. But you were actually elements in the computer program. They really are very clever hyper- intelligent pan-dimensional beings.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looking down)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah. They've nearly finished the oceans.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SLARTIBARTFAST>
<DIRECTION>
They move toward the white cliffs of Dover. A man stands on a cliff holding a giant hose, water spewing from it.
</DIRECTION>
<ARTHUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So -- you're trying to tell me that mice designed and built Deep Thought...and Deep Thought designed the Earth...which was a giant supercomputer...that you built...to calculate the Ultimate Question. Only, Vogons destroyed it ten minutes before the program was completed?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARTHUR>
<SLARTIBARTFAST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's bureaucracy for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SLARTIBARTFAST>
<ARTHUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, this explains a lot. All my life I've had this strange feeling that something was going on in the world, something big, something sinister ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARTHUR>
<SLARTIBARTFAST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's just perfectly normal paranoia. Everyone in the universe has that.

:SC: EXT. EARTH II. ENGLISH COUNTRYSIDE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A & S swoop down and soar over the English countryside -- partially constructed; tall tree stocks with branch and leaves lying beside them, waiting to be attached. Men rolling out sod like a giant carpet, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<SLARTIBARTFAST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know, perhaps I'm old and tired, but I always think that the chances of finding out what's really going on are so absurdly remote that the only thing to do is say hang the sense of it and keep yourself busy. I'd much rather be happy than right any day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SLARTIBARTFAST>
<ARTHUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And are you?

</ARTHUR>
<SLARTIBARTFAST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. That's where it all falls down of course.

(slowing the platform)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here we are, then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SLARTIBARTFAST>
<DIRECTION>
The platform slows to a stop. Arthur steps out and is stunned to see...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS HOUSE. It's partially constructed. The chimney lies intact on the ground, waiting to be hoisted up. A row of hedges lies on it's side beside a trench. But it's his house alright.
</DIRECTION>
<ARTHUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this...?

	Hosts attack you --? And then you sit down for -- is that tea?

Arthur has spotted a TEA POT on the table. He hurries to it, feels it. Warm. He pours a cup, takes a sip, Closes his eyes, enjoying it.

	Yes. Yes, I was. I just wasn't quite prepared for the full reality of it.

He steadies himself on the table.

<BENJY_MOUSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sit, Earthman. Eat.

Benjy pushes his hand through the air, the chair at the end slides backward.

	In a moment, perhaps. I can't seem to let go of this table.

</ARTHUR>
<DIRECTION>
Benjy holds up a strand of hairs, same color as Trillian's.
</DIRECTION>
<BENJY_MOUSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We performed some rudimentary DNA tests on the ship. She's half-native. Her real father was a Blahardid, the hyper- intelligent yet carelessly nomadic race native to the planet Olbed, who apparently popped in to Earth for a one-nighter with a one Ms. Francis McMillan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENJY_MOUSE>
<TRILLIAN>
<DIRECTION>
(looking up, mouth full)

	So -- mostly harmless and me. That's it.

</ARTHUR>
<BENJY_MOUSE>

	We're sorry to have stage managed you so shamelessly, but once we learned you were the only full-blooded Earthling in the universe, it was important that we get you here by any means necessary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENJY_MOUSE>
<FRANKY_MOUSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've spent a considerable amount of time on your planet trying to find this wretched Ultimate Question, and the thought of doing it all over again on account of those idiotic Vogons sickens me to no end. Which is why you're here.

Arthur jumps. The others look up. Benjy and Franky cover their outburst with a smile.

	<DIALOGUE>
	This chair is much more -- comfortable.

Benjy makes a motion. The chair he pushed out before slides over behind Arthur's knees, making him sit.

	Drink.

Ford and Zaphod eat. Benjy turns to Arthur. Smiles. No one notices, through the window, a row of Vogons cresting the hill.
</DIRECTION>
<BENJY_MOUSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	About this Ultimate Question. You see, we've been offered a quite enormously fat contract to do the 5D TV chat show and lecture circuit, and quite frankly, we're very much inclined to take it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENJY_MOUSE>
<FRANKY_MOUSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But - and here's the point - we have to have product. Which means we still need an ultimate question.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKY_MOUSE>
<BENJY_MOUSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or at least, one that sounds ultimate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENJY_MOUSE>
<FRANKY_HOUSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Got to sound good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKY_HOUSE>
<ARTHUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	An Ultimate Question that sounds good... From a couple of mice...for a chat show.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARTHUR>
<FRANKY_MOUSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And as it turns out, the chances are astronomically high that the structure of the question is encoded in your brain. Which is why we need it. More tea?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKY_MOUSE>
<DIRECTION>
Franky tries to pour more tea. Arthur stops drinking, a little woozy. Did he hear them right?
</DIRECTION>
<ARTHUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry -- did you just say you need my brain?

</ARTHUR>
<BENJY_MOUSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. To extract the question.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Barely.

</FRANKY_MOUSE>
<BENJY_MOUSE>

	We can replace it if you think it's important. An electronic brain maybe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENJY_MOUSE>
<FRANKY_MOUSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A simple one should suffice. Who would know the difference?

<ARTHUR>

<BENJY_MOUSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry. You won't feel a thing.

</BENJY_MOUSE>

The mice on the platter move ominously toward Arthur. Arthur, still attached to the chair, backs away.

Scythes and rotating arms with circular saw blades shoot out -- ominous surgical equipment to remove his brain.

Through the opposite window (in much the same way bulldozers arrived in the opening) we see more Vogons arriving.
</DIRECTION>
<ARTHUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine. Take it. There's plenty more where that came from because my head is filled, with questions, and I can assure you mate, no answer to any of them has ever brought me one iota of happiness. Confusion? Yes. Indecision? Loads. But happiness...?
	</DIALOGUE>

He shakes his head.

Benjy steers the platter toward Arthur. He jerks his arms up. They break free of the shackles and hit the platter. The mice fly through the air and land on the table -- right beside the POV gun. They scramble to their feet.
</DIRECTION>
<BENJY_MOUSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shoot him!!

</BENJY_MOUSE>
<DIRECTION>
They try to lift the POV gun but it's way too heavy.

<DIRECTION>
Arthur, his butt still strapped in the chair, leaps over to the table and grabs the first thing he sees -- a leg of mutton. He raises it high. Benjy and Franky look up.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKY_MOUSE>

	Oh, shit.

Arthur brings the mutton down, squashing them flat.

Arthur looks up and now he sees the Vogons marching down the hill toward the house. He leans over the table, bumping his teacup. IT SHATTERS TO THE GROUND.

</ZAPHOD>
<DIRECTION>
The Police open fire. Zaphod and the others flee as the barrage of fire continues. Trillian drops the POV gun, goes back for it. Arthur stops her and pulls her behind the truck. Marvin catches a bullet in the back of his head - sparks fly and he is thrown forwards! Is he dead?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEHIND THE TRUCK --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FORD looks at MARVIN lying face down in the dirt - his head emitting smoke.
</DIRECTION>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay -- that thing I said about not saving my life because we're even? Scratch that. Save at will.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<TRILLIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We need that gun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRILLIAN>
<ZAPHOD>
<DIRECTION>
(campaign sound-byte)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We need tighter gun control!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZAPHOD>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We need his other head.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(an idea)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay -- I'll create a distraction.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<DIRECTION>
He holds up his towel.
</DIRECTION>
<ARTHUR>
<DIRECTION>
(sarcastic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Brilliant plan. I'm certain it will work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARTHUR>
<FORD>
<DIRECTION>
(squinting at Arthur)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know -- I think sometimes you say things that mean something other than what you're actually saying.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<DIRECTION>
More gunfire erupts. Ford spins his towel until it's twisted and taught. He leaps up and runs towards...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...THE VOGON POLICE FORCE -- who see him coming, his towel held like he's going to whip someone on the ass.
</DIRECTION>
<FORD>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
<AHHHHHHHH>
<DIRECTION>
The Vogons are so caught off guard, they back away.
</DIRECTION>
<TRILLIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRILLIAN>
<DIRECTION>
She and Arthur both run out toward the gun.
</DIRECTION>
<ARTHUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought I was...what are you... get back... okay fine...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARTHUR>
<TRILLIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought I was...I'll get it... you already... fine, fine
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRILLIAN>
<DIRECTION>
They each grab the gun just as Questular realizes...
</DIRECTION>
<QUESTULAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a towel! It's only a TOWEL!! GET HIM!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUESTULAR>
<DIRECTION>
The Police stop their retreat, raise their guns, move forward. Ford skids to a stop and runs back toward Arthur and Trillian, both clinging to the gun, running back toward the truck. GUNFIRE ERUPTS. A and T TRIP. The POV gun goes flying and lands in... MARVIN'S ARMS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Vogon Police run in formation toward the gang. Ford looks back, sees the Vogons approaching. He looks forward, sees Marvin raising the gun.
</DIRECTION>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Duck!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<ZAPHOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZAPHOD>
<DIRECTION>
He looks to the skies just as Ford fans out his towel and uses it to bring Z, A & T to the ground just as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARVIN FIRES THE POV GUN,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Questular ducks. CLICK. The entire Vogon Police force is hit. They instantly stop. Their shoulders slump.
</DIRECTION>
<VOGON_POLICE_FORCE>
<DIRECTION>
(in unison)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh what's the point?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOGON_POLICE_FORCE>
<DIRECTION>
They turn their weapons on themselves and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON FORD, ZAPHOD, ARTHUR AND TRILLIAN -- turning their heads as we hear the weapons fire. They look up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All the Vogon Police lie motionless on the ground including Kwaltz. Questular is the last man standing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He marches toward them, patches of clump baldness on his head. He drops to his knees.
</DIRECTION>
<QUESTULAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shoot me. Please Zaphod. Shoot me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUESTULAR>
<DIRECTION>
Zaphod takes the gun, fires it at Questular. He rises -- and paints on a big smile.
</DIRECTION>
<QUESTULAR>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What am I so pissed off about? I'm great? I'm zarking incredible! Everyone loves me! WHOOO HOOO!!! Look at me...etc.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUESTULAR>
<DIRECTION>
Questular runs towards a lake/blow hole, takes off his clothes and jumps in.
</DIRECTION>
<ZAPHOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marvin. You saved our lives.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZAPHOD>
<MARVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. Wretched, isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARVIN>
<QUESTULAR>
<DIRECTION>
(distant)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh man! I love being me!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUESTULAR>
<DIRECTION>
They share a laugh. Arthur approaches Slartibartfast.
</DIRECTION>
<ARTHUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARTHUR>
<SLARTIBARTFAST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've just been informed by some of the lads that since we're so near completion, we're going to go ahead and finish Earth. We can put it back exactly the way it was when you left, you know -- unless there's anything you'd like to change. Something you think your planet could do without?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SLARTIBARTFAST>
<DIRECTION>
Arthur thinks about it...looks around...slowly nods...
</DIRECTION>
<ARTHUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARTHUR>
<DIRECTION>
He looks to Trillian who raises an eyebrow. Really? She smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<TRILLIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go somewhere.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRILLIAN>
<ARTHUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, You name it. I'll go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARTHUR>
<ZAPHOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to Humma's. He has my head...I think. Doesn't he? I'm so confused.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZAPHOD>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I'm hungry. After we get your head let's grab a bite. I know this great restaurant at the end of the universe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<DIRECTION>
As they walk away, we CUT TO...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: SLARTI'S FACTORY ELEVATOR -- where they all board.
</DIRECTION>
<SLARTIBARTFAST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Hold tight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SLARTIBARTFAST>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone grabs the rail, except for Trillian who holds on to Arthur. SSSSSSHHHHHHHHHVUMP! Up into the sky they go.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stand-by for commencement of life cycle. All systems checked and cleared. Commencing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
We hear KL-KLUNK. BZZZZZZZ... and watch nature burst into life - animals run - flowers bloom - waterfalls cascade - mountains rise in the mist - monkeys bathe in hot springs etc. Set to a wonderful, uplifting piece of music ("WHAT A WONDERFUL WORLD?").
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tilt up to the sky. The day turns to night. Stars appear. The Heart of Gold streaks through the stars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
