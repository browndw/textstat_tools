EXT. STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small kid, TJ FORNEY (13), with a grubby worn cast on his arm, rides his BMX really fast down a street. He chases a tow truck towing a badly wrecked red Volvo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He struggles to keep up. The truck makes a turn. TJ follows, turning dangerously in front of oncoming traffic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The truck makes another turn. TJ turns with it, running straight into the side of a car pulling out of a driveway. He comes off his bike and is thrown across the hood. He picks himself up, stunned. The driver of the car gets out to see if he's hurt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TJ looks down the street to see the tow truck disappearing in the distance. He hurries back to his bike. He jumps on and continues after the truck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TJ gives chase. He gains on the truck. He can see it pull into a used car lot ahead - FAIR OAKS CAR CITY.
</DIRECTION>

Tony looks through his papers for the work order. TJ doesn't like being ignored. He moves around to the driver's side of the wrecked car and wrenches open the bashed-in door. He climbs behind the wheel, slams the door shut and locks the door.

INT. FORNEY HOUSE / KITCHEN - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
INT. FORNEY HOUSE / TV ROOM - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TJ stands holding a banana and wearing a backpack in front of the couch where his dad is sleeping. Dad is lying face down, half-covered with a sheet, his leg hanging off the side. There's dirty plates and pill bottles on the coffee table in what is otherwise an old lady's living room. Dad stirs, it's a pathetic sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TJ taps Dad's leg with his foot. Dad slowly comes to life and notices TJ.

TJ on his BMX pedals down the drive and out onto the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TJ pedals in the middle of a suburban street. He steers his bike with his broken arm as he tries to peel and eat the banana with the other. He glides down a hill. It's a long hill. He travels fast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Despite the glide and the wind in his hair he's slouching and looks depressed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOUSING DEVELOPMENT - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TJ rides his bike through an eerily barren unfinished housing development - half-built houses and perfectly sealed wide streets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Up ahead, he can see a small section of unfinished road - a big patch of dirt and rocks. He veers up a driveway to avoid it. He passes the dirt patch and then comes down off the curb back onto the road, trying to keep control of his bike. He hits the road and loses his balance. The handlebars twist and he crashes onto the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He jumps up and yelps in pain, clutching his elbow. He looks at it. It's badly grazed. He yelps again, angry. He picks up a rock lying in the street and charges towards an unfinished house. He hurls the rock through its front window. Glass crashes down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A silent beat passes, and then the front door of the house opens and a late-20s, long-greasy-haired, wiry shirtless guy in filthy black jeans emerges. He has a baby moustache and a cracked front tooth. This is HESHER. He makes a determined line toward TJ.
</DIRECTION>
<HESHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The fuck you think you're doing!?
	</DIALOGUE>

INT. HALF-BUILT HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Hesher drags TJ into the unfinished front room. He slams TJ against an uncoated drywall. Hesher pulls a pair of garden shears from his back pocket and squeezes TJ's nose between the blades.
</DIRECTION>

TJ is terrified. He squirms.
</DIRECTION>
<HESHER>

</DIRECTION>
<HESHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bullshit. You're gonna fuckin' -
	</DIALOGUE>
</HESHER>
<DIRECTION>
Hesher is suddenly startled. His ears prick up like a rabbit. He hits the deck dragging TJ down with him. Their faces are close together. Hesher makes a very serious finger-to-mouth gesture to 'shhhh'.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SOUND of a car idling outside. Hesher listens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TJ is on his stomach, freaked. TJ looks around the room - a duffel bag, some beer cans, a few porn magazines, a weathered bass guitar and a sleeping bag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A car door closes loudly. Hesher peers through the window and sees a SECURITY GUARD inspecting TJ's bike in the front yard and then making his way toward the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hesher looks at TJ with serious and considered venom.
</DIRECTION>
<HESHER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's in there?
	</DIALOGUE>

Hesher lights the fuse on a stick of homemade dynamite wrapped in duct tape and throws it through the broken window. He then slips out the back door, leaving TJ face down on the floor freaked out and confused.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! Get back here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECURITY_GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
TJ jumps to his feet and looks out the window. A dirty black van screams out onto the road and tears away, spraying dirt and rocks in its wake. The security guard stumbles around, covered in dirt and disoriented. He rushes back to his car and gives chase. TJ lets them get away up the street, then bolts to the front door.

Outside a public high school, kids mill around before class. Lots of noise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TJ rides down a path and clocks Dustin Howard, the kid from the car lot, who stands talking with friends by his car - a shiny 2007 YELLOW CONVERTIBLE MUSTANG. They spot each other. TJ quickly looks away (oh shit) and b-lines for the bike rack.
</DIRECTION>

TJ sits in the back of the class, by the window.

A little pebble hits TJ's desk. It bounces onto the floor. TJ looks around to find where it came from - and then another one hits him in the head.
</DIRECTION>

He looks out the window. Hesher is right outside the window. He takes the cap off of a large BLACK MAGIC MARKER. He holds it up to his nose and takes a long slow inhale. He exhales slow and long, staring hard at TJ.

	</DIALOGUE>
</DUSTIN>
<DIRECTION>
We see that someone has drawn - in BIG BLACK MARKER - a crude picture of a body, sitting on a toilet with a big erect penis. The picture is drawn on the side of Dustin's Mustang door, so his real head lines up with the drawing. It's drawn in perspective so it looks like Dustin's head is attached to the naked defecating body to outsiders. The words 'SUCK MY COCK' have been scrawled beside the picture. Dustin swerves the car toward TJ, narrowly missing him. TJ cuts into a large super market parking lot, attempting to get away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dustin accelerates ahead of TJ and screeches to a halt in front of him, cutting him off, almost hitting him. TJ stumbles and falls off his bike. His bike lands on top of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dustin jumps out of his car and starts beating TJ in the middle of parking lot traffic. TJ struggles just to protect himself, cowering on the ground and covering his head. Dustin tries to wrestle TJ free of the bike so as to get a clearer shot at him. He drags TJ by his T-shirt, ripping it off in the process.

	I used to make a cherry cake all the time and it always came out just wonderful. One time I invited my doctor and his wife and I wanted to make an impression. I asked him to come see your dad in a play and he came and I said, 'would you like to come back to the house?'

The front door opens and Dad enters, wearing old sweatpants, a dirty T-shirt, and carrying a plastic grocery bag.

Hesher enters the kitchen. Grandma is still crumbing chicken.

He starts going through drawers right next to her. He doesn't acknowledge her.

Hesher strides across the back lawn in his underwear.

Hesher reaches a telephone pole and climbs it nimbly like a monkey. At the top, he fiddles around with the fork, banging and wrenching at the cable box.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He drops the fork to the ground and begins his descent. Only a couple of feet from the ground, he loses his grip and falls, crashing down into a thick bush at the base of the pole.

Larry takes a breath. He doesn't want to be having this conversation. He counts the obstacles out on his fingers.
</DIRECTION>
<LARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. We're talking at least eighteen hundred dollars, not including taxes, registration, ADM, or dealer's fees. On top of that, you'd need a driver's license. I'm guessing you don't have one of those. You'd need valid car insurance. I'm guessing you don't have that either. But even if you did have these things, I still couldn't sell it to you because the car's not street legal. There's a million reasons why I can't sell it to you.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HESHER'S VAN - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hesher brings the van to a quiet halt across the street from a suburban house. He kills the engine and surveys the area.

TJ has no idea where they are.
</DIRECTION>
<TJ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are we -
	</DIALOGUE>
</TJ>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing?

	</DIALOGUE>
</TJ>
<DIRECTION>
Hesher makes his way across the street toward the house and the yellow Mustang.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pours gasoline all over the car. He does this with confidence - he's clearly had some practice.
</DIRECTION>
<TJ>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (loud whisper - too loud)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on. This is insane. Let's get out of here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TJ>
<DIRECTION>
Hesher ignores him and continues dousing the car with gas.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The porch light comes on. Someone peels open the front window curtains and looks out. TJ and Hesher drop to the ground behind the Mustang. TJ is terrified. He looks over to Hesher who is smiling, in his element, this is the happiest we have seen him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The curtains close but the porch light stays on. Unfazed, Hesher hops back up and empties the gas can onto the Mustang.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hesher stands a moment, admiring the car, saying a silent goodbye to it perhaps, as he pulls a single bent cigarette from his pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He straightens it, then lights it with a match.
</DIRECTION>
<TJ>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (QUIETLY FRANTIC)
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Instantly, it erupts in flames.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hesher picks up the gas can and walks calmly back to the van. TJ follows still franticly looking back at the car and the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hesher gets in the van and throws the gas can into the back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TJ goes to the passenger door.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
TJ takes off, running across the street and through a neighbor's yard, down the side of the neighbor's house, with the woman on the porch screaming at him.

TJ runs. He jumps fences and slips down the sides of houses. He's running fast and breathing hard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He finds his way out onto another dark and quiet street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stops. He has no idea where he is or where to go.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then - HEADLIGHTS appear at the end of the street. They bear down on him slowly. TJ stands immobile. He can now see it is Hesher's van, approaching slow and menacing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The van stops about 10 feet from TJ. A moment's stand off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then Hesher sticks his head out the window.

<DIRECTION>
Hesher revs the engine some more. TJ still doesn't move.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hesher FLOORS THE VAN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON TJ - the headlights of the van bear down on him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hesher slams on the brakes and the van screeches to a halt inches from TJ's nose. TJ doesn't flinch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He and Hesher stare at each other through the windshield.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hesher smiles. He's impressed.

TJ walks around to the passenger door.

Then Hesher lets out a FART. He laughs. He puts the van in gear and drives. He cranks up the music.

It was too much. I couldn't work out which chick was which and I'm making one girl cum but then I'm forgetting about the others and my tongue's hurting and my fingers are getting tired and like eventually I was just like 'Fuck this. This is too much' and I just stepped back. I just stepped back. And before you know it these girls are all working on each other, you know.

Hesher turns the wheel hard and floors the gas. The van spins in circles spraying dirt in every direction. TJ gets thrown from the back seat onto the ground. Dirt pours into the windows and covers them from head to toe. Hesher corrects the wheel and veers back onto the road again.

</HESHER>

He throws it in the pool. Nicole and TJ have to dive out of the way. They go to the sides of the pool and climb out laughing, while Hesher continues heaving garden furniture, a barbecue and anything else in reach into the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TJ and Nicole sit on the edge of the pool with their legs dangling in the water. They're fully clothed and soaking wet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks off, around the side of the house, looking for more things to break.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is an awkward silent moment between TJ and Nicole. TJ looks down and notices a small army of ants marching along the side of the pool. He manages to get one to crawl onto the his finger.
</DIRECTION>
<NICOLE>

	So, how do you know this guy?

TJ flicks the ant off of his finger, then another one that's climbing up his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<NICOLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you realize that the equivalent to you flicking that ant would be like one of us getting hit in the face by a giant wrecking ball at 100 miles an hour and getting thrown into the next yard?

TJ stops mid ant flicking.
</DIRECTION>

	</DIALOGUE>
</NICOLE>
<DIRECTION>
TJ doesn't know how to answer.

Hesher reappears with a container of lighter fluid and goes to the diving board. He climbs on and squirts the lighter fluid through his lighter, sending streams of flames into the pool.

And this went on for weeks, the snake wouldn't go near him. That tiny mouse used to sit in a little miniature lawn chair scratching his balls and shelling peanuts and this snake was just too scared to go near it. And cuz the snake was scared of that mouse I had to feed him other mice, but every time I dropped another mouse in the tank, it'd hide behind the brave mouse. And so eventually the snake starved to death. I had a cage full of mice.

Dad is asleep on the couch. A single shaft of bright sunlight lands on his face, causing him to stir.

TJ nimbly reaches down to the table, covered with dirty dishes and pill bottles, and quietly picks up his dad's wallet. He removes an ATM card and places the wallet back where it was. He exits.

Hesher is pouring himself a bowl of Captain Crunch Berries. He pours milk onto the cereal. He does a half-hearted side-to-side stretch, getting ready for his walk. He looks out the window - gray clouds suggest rain. He takes the bowl with him out of the kitchen.

</DIRECTION>
<HESHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grandma?

He shakes her again, this time a little harder. Nothing. He stands up, looking at her still body. As he realizes she is not waking up, his breath becomes fast, fighting hard not to get emotional.

TJ is in shock. He sits on the couch next to dad. They are both lost for words. Hesher stands in the corner with his head shoved between the walls.

Hesher joins TJ and Dad on the couch. They are all raging inside, confused, lost and upset. They sit together in silence for a long beat, in the same boat for the first time.

Hesher breaks the silence. He kicks the table over as he stands.

We can faintly hear heavy breathing/moaning coming from the bedroom.

TJ walks over to a door. It's an inch ajar. He pushes it open gently.

He turns back to his van, gets in, slams the door and peels away. TJ picks himself up out of the mud, grabs his bike and rides off in the opposite direction. Dad stands holding his bloody nose. He watches Hesher, he watches TJ. He is left confused and bleeding in the pouring rain.

TJ doesn't quite know what to do now. He stares at Dustin who looks genuinely frightened. TJ releases the shears and backs away. And the second he does so, Dustin leaps off the couch, grabs TJ by the throat and slams him down on the living room floor. TJ drops the shears.

<DUSTIN>

</DUSTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Dustin wails into TJ. TJ cowers on the ground. Punches land UNTIL -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LAWN CHAIR comes CRASHING through the front window into the living room, raining glass everywhere. Dustin stops punching, stunned, and looks up to see Hesher, dripping wet, step through the big nasty hole he has just made.
</DIRECTION>

<DUSTIN>

Dustin moves to stand. Hesher pounces on him, dragging him along the ground. He grabs the shears and brings them straight up to Dustin's nose. In the same movement, he snaps the shears shut and takes the end of Dustin's nose off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dustin squeals in pain and scurries backwards, clutching his face, blood leaking between his fingers. TJ stands, stunned.

They look at each other a moment. Hesher looks taken aback. He honestly believed he was doing a good thing.

EXT. RED BRIDGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TJ rides his bike over a rickety red bridge. He pulls his bike up outside the tall wire fence of a big dirty wrecking yard - D&S Auto-Wreckers. It's still raining very hard. TJ is soaking wet. He sits on his bike, looking at mountains of wrecked cars inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TJ hops off his bike and shoves it behind a dumpster. He gets up on the dumpster and climbs the wrecking yard's fence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. D&S WRECKING YARD - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TJ roams the stacks, looking for his mother's car. He looks distraught. All around sit stacks of wrecked cars. A vicious dog on a chain barks and snarls nearby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TJ stops. He sees his mom's car atop a tall stack of wrecks. He looks at it a moment, contemplating what to do. He moves to the base of the stack and begins to climb.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He clambers slowly up the pile in the rain. It's awkward and difficult and more than a little dangerous.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally he reaches the top. He wrenches open the car door and squeezes behind the wheel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RED VOLVO - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>

TJ sits, catching his breath. The rain clatters on the roof of the car. TJ is up high enough to see the lights of the surrounding neighborhood. He sits and contemplates the last few days and months of his life.

He closes his eyes.

</DAD>
<DIRECTION>
The three emerge from the house. TJ is wearing a suit and carrying the pizza box, Dad's carrying the heavy present, and Mom's carrying a bouquet of flowers and her purse. Dad stands at the door of a little white car. Clearly the box is too big.

She turns to Dad and we can see her lipstick has gone up onto her cheek. She smiles at Dad. They all smile at this, then -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From out of nowhere, the car is T-BONED on the passenger's side. The impact is massive. The NOISE is deafening. Smashed glass. The car spins into the oncoming traffic and is hit by a delivery truck. The car flips. More deafening noise...

A crane is lifting the car with a huge wrecking yard magnet. As it rises off the stack, it dangles at a precarious angle.

<DIRECTION>
INT. RED VOLVO - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TJ is thrown through the car to be wedged up against the windshield. He panics. He yells. He squirms his way to the window and waves his arm wildly outside, yelling, trying to get the attention of the guys below. The car shifts violently and TJ slides out through the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. D&S WRECKING YARD - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>

TJ is hanging dangerously out of the car, swinging his legs and screaming at the top of his lungs. His voice can barely be heard over the sound of machinery.

A guy on the ground, MARIO, looks up and spots TJ. He frantically looks to get the crane operator's attention.

TJ doesn't respond, he backs away.
</DIRECTION>

Mario watches him walk away, still disbelieving. He turns back to Ricky and gives him the all clear to start her up again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TJ walks to the entrance gate while behind him his mom's car is hoisted high in the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TJ stops at a dirty vending machine by the gate. He pulls coins from his pocket and slots them in. It spits out a chocolate bar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Moments later TJ stands with his half-eaten chocolate bar while watching his Mom's car get fed into a giant crushing machine and compacted into scrap. Tears well in his eyes. He feels helpless.

</DAD>
<FUNERAL_DIRECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know that we discussed your preferences for some aspects of today's service, including your choice of the cedar casket which the insurance company had covered. Unfortunately we were out of those and instead we've chosen a mahogany casket. Now there is an extra charge for the mahogany which I need to clear with you before we proceed. Is that OK?

</DIRECTION>
<MRS_ROSOWSKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I did not know Madeleine long enough, but from the moment I moved into the neighborhood so many years ago, she treated me as though I was part of the family. Madeleine always had open arms and welcomed friends as kindly as her own. She had such a kind wonderful heart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ROSOWSKI>
<DIRECTION>
While Agnes speaks, TJ and Dad notice the funeral director, off to the side, whispering business to two of his employees. He makes every attempt to be subtle and discreet about it, but he is clearly struggling with today's workload.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_ROSOWSKI>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We shared so many wonderful walks and enjoyed each other's company very much. I will miss our walks. I will miss our talks and most of all, I will miss Madeleine. I will always remember what she told me, life is like walking in the rain, you can either hide and take shelter or you can just get wet. She was dear to me and she will always have a place in my heart.

</DIRECTION>
<TJ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TJ>
<DIRECTION>
TJ makes his way off the stage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sound of slow clapping from the back. It's Hesher. His hair looks extra greasy, he's wearing a dirty white Budweiser T-shirt and he's holding a tall can of beer under his arm which spills as he claps. He is VERY drunk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The funeral director tries to wrap it up.
</DIRECTION>
<FUNERAL_DIRECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OK, so at this point we should conclude today's service with a moment's silence, after which lemonade will be served in the...
	</DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
<HESHER>

	</DIALOGUE>
</HESHER>

	</DIALOGUE>
</FUNERAL_DIRECTOR>

</DIRECTION>
<HESHER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>

	</DIALOGUE>
</HESHER>
<DIRECTION>
There is a beat of silence. No one knows what to say or do.
</DIRECTION>
<HESHER>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<HESHER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I pulled the gas tank from an old Chevy and I wanted to fuckin' blow it up, so I did. I didn't think about the millions of bits of metal that were gonna fly in every direction. I almost killed myself. I woke up in a hospital. I couldn't remember what happened and then this doctor at the end of my bed said 'son', and I said, 'don't call me son you fuckin' cunt', then he said, 'you blew off your nut'. Some shrapnel had penetrated my left scrotal sack and ripped the furry sucker right off. My left fucking nut was gone, just like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HESHER>
<DIRECTION>
Hesher makes a magic disappearing arm gesture, spilling a bit of beer on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<HESHER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I went crazy. I assaulted a nurse, a doctor or two, I can't remember. I got arrested. I got sent to juvie. But all I could think about day and night was my missing fuckin' nut. I couldn't eat or sleep, I just wanted my fucking nut back. I had to get out of there and find it, so I busted out of juvie and went lookin' for it. I looked for days, but didn't find shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HESHER>
<DIRECTION>
The tiny crowd listens, half offended, half intrigued.
</DIRECTION>
<HESHER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And then one night I was taking a shit and I was just staring down at my balls, looking at my flabby piece of sack where my left nut used to be and then I noticed my right nut, for like the first time. My right nut was just sitting there, totally happy, just hanging out. All this time I'd been driving myself crazy thinking about my missing nut and not thinking about the nut I still had all along. And I realized, I've still got a nut. I've still got one good nut. God or the Devil or whoever left me with one good nut. At least I didn't lose both my nuts. I've still got one good nut and it works, and my dick works too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HESHER>
<DIRECTION>
Hesher looks up at TJ and Dad, sad and imploring, he's made his point. They look back at him stunned.
</DIRECTION>
<HESHER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You lost your mom. You lost your wife. I lost a nut.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HESHER>
<DIRECTION>
Hesher takes the last swig of his Budweiser. He sways, drunk. This soaks in with the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<HESHER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HESHER>
<DIRECTION>
Hesher throws the can down. He goes to stomp on it. He misses and stumbles, crashing into the microphone podium, knocking it over and falling in a heap with it. He starts puking on the stage. A couple of old ladies are horrified.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The funeral director motions to his assistants that now is the time to move the coffin out. Hesitantly, they obey. Hesher looks over from the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<HESHER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leave her alone. We're not finished yet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HESHER>
<FUNERAL_DIRECTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(POLITELY)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Unfortunately sir, we need to be.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FUNERAL_DIRECTOR>
<DIRECTION>
They continue to push the coffin away. Hesher lifts himself up and wipes the vomit from his face and steps toward the coffin. The funeral workers back away.
</DIRECTION>
<HESHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told Grandma I was going on a walk with her and I'm gonna do it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HESHER>
<DIRECTION>
Determined, Hesher leans down and unlocks the wheels of the coffin stand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dad stands, not exactly sure what to do.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With purpose Hesher pushes the coffin down the stage ramp and down the center aisle of the room, toward the exit. He turns to TJ -
</DIRECTION>
<HESHER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You promised Grandma you'd go on a walk with her. This is your last chance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HESHER>
<DIRECTION>
Hesher seems overcome with emotion, he continues pushing the coffin toward the exit and out through the doors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TJ and Dad watch him, unsure. After a moment, They follow him to the door. They stand at the doors watching Hesher push the coffin out into the parking lot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TJ is overcome with emotion, his eyes well with tears. He heads across the lot and catches up with Hesher, joining him on the walk. Dad watches for a beat, his eyes well up too, then he does the same.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All three are now walking together through the funeral home parking lot with Grandma's coffin. They don't speak. It's a release. Other mourners watch from the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FUNERAL HOME - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hesher wheels Grandma's coffin across the parking lot with TJ and Dad beside him. They seem solemn and strangely dignified in a dishevelled way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hesher leads them out of the parking lot and into the street. Traffic passes around them. Some cars come to a complete stop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hesher gets the coffin up onto the sidewalk on the other side of the street and the three continue their silent walk with Grandma.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In slow motion the three walk. Dad puts his arm around TJ's shoulders, TJ puts his arm around Dad's.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then a cop car cruises beside them slow. The cops inside watch them. Dad looks over. One of the cops smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FORNEY HOUSE - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cop car pulls up outside the house. The back door opens and Hesher falls out onto the sidewalk, still very drunk. Dad climbs out and steps over Hesher helping him to his feet. A cop speaks to them from the open window.
</DIRECTION>
<OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
(SMILING)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll get him to bed now, won't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OFFICER>
<DAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the plan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAD>
<DIRECTION>
Hesher squirms and slurs.
</DIRECTION>
<HESHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get your hands off me, pig.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HESHER>
<DAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the plan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAD>
<DIRECTION>
The cop gives them a casual wave as their car pulls away. TJ and Dad help Hesher across the lawn to the front door. We hold on the house for a beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FORNEY HOUSE / BATHROOM - NEXT MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Close on scissors to beard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dad stands over the sink cutting away at his beard. Golden sunlight pours in through the windows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A moment later he lathers his face up with shaving cream.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FORNEY HOUSE / TJ'S ROOM - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a gentle knock at the door. TJ wakes and makes a big stretch. His hair's a mess.
</DIRECTION>
<TJ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TJ>
<DIRECTION>
Dad enters, he's clean-shaven now. He looks like a new man.
</DIRECTION>
<DAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Morning, Teej.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAD>
<TJ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. Look at you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TJ>
<DAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. It feels weird. I can feel air on my face.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAD>
<TJ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hardly recognize you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TJ>
<DAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think Hesher's gone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAD>
<TJ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gone where?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TJ>
<DAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. But I think you should come take a look at this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAD>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FORNEY HOUSE / GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The garage door is open. The garage is flooded with daylight and no sign of Hesher.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TJ and Dad walks across the garage to the open door. At the garage's entrance they stop. Their eyes register something seriously unusual outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
'Master of Puppets' by Metallica punches in. LOUD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A giant red cube of Volvo scrap metal has been placed in the center of the driveway like a huge piece of abstract art. They stand and stare at it, almost in awe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then from the across the street, we see the object in the driveway and TJ and Dad on the porch looking at it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We also see the words 'HESHER WAS HERE!' spray painted on the front of the house in big letters, as yet unseen by TJ and Dad. Dad puts his arm around TJ's shoulders.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the beat we CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HESHER MOMENTS:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hesher ripping on the guitar; Hesher blowing something up; Hesher cupping a fart and putting it in TJ's face; Hesher pantsing Dad; Hesher metal saluting Grandma and Grandma saluting him back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hesher behind the wheel of his van, smoking a cigarette and making a direct line for the setting sun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A mouse sits an in a tiny armchair like a human, shelling a peanut. He throws the shell over his shoulder watching the setting sun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO BLACK:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
