An ALARM CLOCK BUZZES. An aged hand shuts it off and picks up the nearby glasses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CARL sits alone in his double bed. He rubs his face. GRUNTS. He gets out of bed, STRETCHING, GRUNTING and CRACKING BONES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs his cane, with four tennis balls stuck to the bottom spokes.

<DIRECTION>
INT. CARL'S STAIRCASE - LATER

Now dressed, Carl rides his ELDERLY ASSISTANCE CHAIR down the staircase. This takes a LONG, LONG time.

EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, PORCH - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Many LOCKS are heard unlocking from inside. The door opens, but bangs against the safety chain. Carl GRUMBLES in frustration. Carl opens the door, walks out onto his porch, pulls the door shut, and looks as if he's about to go somewhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sits in his porch chair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CARL'S NEIGHBORHOOD - CONTINUOUS

He looks through the mail.

EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, PORCH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens. A Wilderness Explorer stands, reading from a Wilderness Explorer Manual. He is in uniform, complete with sash, neckerchief, hat, and an enormous backpack stuffed with every piece of equipment there is. This is RUSSELL, age 8. Russell, nose buried in his MANUAL, reads to Carl.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>

	"Good afternoon. My name is Russell. And I am a Wilderness Explorer in Tribe 54, Sweatlodge 12. Are you in need of any assistance today, sir?"

Russell points to his SASH. It is covered with badges except for one glaringly empty space.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See these? These are my Wilderness Explorer badges. You may notice one is missing. It's my Assisting the Elderly badge. If I get it I will become a Senior Wilderness Explorer!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Russell makes the Explorer Sign: his thumbs form a "W", his fingers the "wings" of a bird, then the "claws" of a bear.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"The wilderness must be explored! CAW-CAW! RAAAR!"

This sets Carl's hearing aid off. Carl GRUMBLES in pain.

</RUSSELL>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bird. Beady eyes. Every night it sneaks in my yard and gobbles my poor azaleas. I'm elderly and infirm. I can't catch it. If only someone could help me...

Carl rolls his eyes and begins to close his door.

He stops short.

A large truck is backing up, getting dangerously close to

ELLIE'S MAILBOX.

Carl HITS the worker with his cane. He falls to the sidewalk. The worker rubs his head. Blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carl backs up toward his door, cradling his mailbox. What has he done?

Passerbys stare. Workers gather, as does the REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER.

Carl backs into his house.

Carl looks at the Adventure Shrine, and the PAINTING of their house by Paradise Falls. He holds the Shady Oaks pamphlet.

A SHADOW falls over the nurses. They turn to look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A giant tarp rises behind Carl's house. It unfolds to reveal
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THOUSANDS OF BALLOONS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The balloons rise up like some massive multi-colored cumulus cloud forming a thunderhead above the house. Strings tug at the chimney. The house strains. Pipes bend, then break. Electrical wires spark and snap. The house rips away from its foundation.
</DIRECTION>

The nurses duck and YELL as the house soars over them. Carl looks out the window and LAUGHS.

<DIRECTION>
This is Muntz's obsession. He looks over to a full size skeleton.
</DIRECTION>
<MUNTZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Beautiful, isn't it? I've spent a lifetime tracking it. Sometimes years go by between sightings... I've tried to smoke it out of that deathly labyrinth where it lives... Can't go in after it. Once in, there's no way out. Lost so many dogs...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Muntz is lost in reverie.

Carl leads Russell toward the door.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But we haven't even had dessert yet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
Muntz follows behind them slowly, menacingly.
</DIRECTION>
<MUNTZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, the boy's right. You haven't had dessert. Epsilon here makes a delicious Cherries Jubilee.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUNTZ>
<DIRECTION>
Carl pulls Russell along, Muntz following behind like something out of a bad dream.
</DIRECTION>
<MUNTZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, you really must stay. I insist! We have so much more to talk about!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUNTZ>
<DIRECTION>
A distant HAUNTED WAIL. Everyone stops.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kevin?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Muntz walks to the window and looks out. Atop the roof he sees THE BIRD.
</DIRECTION>
<MUNTZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He turns back to Carl... but they're gone.

	Hurry!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARL>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am hurrying!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
Dogs descend down the ramp behind them.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're coming!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
Carl and Russell run toward the cave opening. Dogs block the cave opening. Carl stops short.
</DIRECTION>
<DUG>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Master, over here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUG>
<DIRECTION>
Dug points to a tunnel opening deeper inside the cave. Carl and Russell run toward him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cave leads to a steep incline. The dogs are getting closer. There's no choice but to JUMP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lift from the overhead balloons allows Carl and Russell to leap down the incline, like astronauts.
</DIRECTION>
<DUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go toward the light, master!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Dogs climb down the rocks, closing in on Carl and Russell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bird sees the dogs. She jumps off the house and lifts Carl and Russell on her back. She runs through the cave, towing the house behind her. Russell and Carl HANG ON for dear life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BANG BANG BANG! Balloons pop as they scrape across the ceiling. The house lowers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ahead, a giant rock sits in their path. Carl tugs at the house but it CRASHES against the rock, pulling Russell onto the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Russell!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARL>
<DIRECTION>
Dragging on the ground, Russell gets BUMPED around badly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MOUNTAIN, CANYON - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dogs close in on Russell. Alpha bites at his heels. Carl fends off Alpha with his cane.
</DIRECTION>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get back!!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Alpha is about to bite when an avalanche of boulders rains down! The dogs stop short.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carl looks back as the bird keeps running. Dug is up on the canyon wall. He caused the avalanche!
</DIRECTION>
<DUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go on Master! I will stop the dogs!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Dug jumps down to block the path of the approaching dogs.
</DIRECTION>
<DUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop you dogs!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUG>
<DIRECTION>
The dogs run around Dug.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alpha bites Dug by the neck and throws him out of the path.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bird carries Carl, Russell dragging along behind. She rounds a corner. Russell SWINGS OUT over the abyss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bird jumps from rock spire to spire. Russell swings back and forth wildly in the air.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help! Help!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
Russell does the WILDERNESS EXPLORER CALL.
</DIRECTION>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gimme your hand!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Carl holds out his cane so that Russell can GRAB it and Carl PULLS him back onto the bird. Meanwhile Dug manages to rejoin his friends, but just in time to reach the end of the line -- A CLIFF EDGE. A river winds 100 feet below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carl looks above to see the house's momentum pulling forward.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hang on to Kevin!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
Carl grabs onto Kevin and picks Dug up by the collar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just as the dogs reach our gang, the house's momentum carries them across the chasm. Alpha bites the bird on the leg but is kicked loose and falls into the river below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carl LANDS HARD but safely across the river chasm. The dogs are stuck on the other side. Carl painfully gets up. He looks up at his house. It's still intact.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He breathes a SIGH OF RELIEF.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kevin!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
The bird tries to stand but SQUAWKS pitifully and falls back to the ground. Russell rushes to her side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bird's leg has been injured badly by the dog bite. She can't stand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Russell applies a bandage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the distant labyrinth of rocks, the BIRD BABIES call. Kevin CALLS back to them. She tries to stand, but can't.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Russell runs to her side.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No no no! Kevin! Stay down.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Carl)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's hurt real bad. Can't we help her get home?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
Carl looks at the bird's wounds. He looks to the rock maze, then to his house. He knows the right thing to do. And he hates himself for it.
</DIRECTION>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright. But we've got to hurry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARL>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DIRIGIBLE, COCKPIT

<DIRECTION>
DUG'S COLLAR SCREEN powers on, and a signal zeroes in on Dug's location.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dug, oblivious, looks out over the landscape, sniffing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carl and Russell peek out from behind a tree.
</DIRECTION>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See anything?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARL>
<DUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, my pack is not following us! Boy they are dumb.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Dug scampers back to Carl and Russell, who pull the house from behind a tree canopy.
</DIRECTION>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is crazy. I finally meet my childhood hero and he's trying to kill us! What a joke.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARL>
<DUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, I know a joke. A squirrel walks up to a tree and says I forgot to store acorns for winter and now I am dead. Ha! It is funny because the squirrel gets dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They pull the house, keeping it hidden behind the trees.
</DIRECTION>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Careful Russell.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The house bumps into a tree, jostling the injured BIRD on the porch.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You okay, Kevin?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Kevin goes back to sleep. Russell looks at her BANDAGED LEG.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what, Mr. Fredricksen? The wilderness isn't quite what I expected.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah? How so?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARL>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's kinda... wild. I mean, it's not how they made it sound in my book.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hmm, get used to that, kid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARL>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My dad made it sound so easy. He's really good at camping, and how to make fire from rocks and stuff. He used to come to all my Sweatlodge meetings.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
Russell smiles at the thought.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And afterwards we'd go get ice cream at Fentons. I always get chocolate and he gets butter- brickle. Then we'd sit on this one curb, right outside, and I'll count all the blue cars and he counts all the red ones, and whoever gets the most, wins. I like that curb.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up at Carl.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That might sound boring, but I think the boring stuff is the stuff I remember the most.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They walk in silence. Carl understands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bird babies CALL OUT in the distance. Kevin CALLS BACK.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, there it is!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
Russell spots the labyrinth, now close by. He tries to run but is pulled back by his tether.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LAUGHING, Carl unclips Russell's tether.
</DIRECTION>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold on Russell, stand still!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARL>
<DIRECTION>
Carl ties the hose harnesses to a tree, securing the house. Russell helps Kevin off the porch and the group run toward the labyrinth entrance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kevin is reenergized by the sound of her babies. She runs off ahead. Carl and Russell LAUGH.
</DIRECTION>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at that bird go!

</CARL>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait up, you overgrown chicken!

</CARL>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's it, go Kevin! Go find your babies!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
Just as they approach the entrance to the labyrinth, a fierce spotlight hits them. MUNTZ'S DIRIGIBLE lowers overhead.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Run Kevin! Run!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
A net shoots out and binds her. She falls and CALLS OUT.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh no!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
The net catches on a rock. Carl and Russell run to her aid.
</DIRECTION>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Russell, give me your knife!

</CARL>
<DIRECTION>
Carl saws frantically at the net.

</MUNTZ>
<DIRECTION>
Muntz and his dogs descend from the dirigible. Beside them, a group of dogs drag forward CARL'S HOUSE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Muntz hurls a lit lantern. Flames burst up beneath the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heat waves ripple up. Balloons POP. Carl's house LOWERS into the fire.
</DIRECTION>

Carl panics. He rushes toward the house, dropping the knife.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Muntz motions to the dogs. They swarm past Russell, knocking him down and grabbing the bird in the net.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Carl pulls his house away from the flames.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bird CALLS OUT plaintively as the dogs drag her into the dirigible.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Muntz follows the bird up the ramp of the dirigible.
</DIRECTION>
<MUNTZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Careful. We want her in good shape for my return.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUNTZ>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let her go! Stop!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
Russell runs after the dogs, but the gangplank closes. The dirigible flies off.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kevin!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Carl beats out the flames with his jacket. He extinguishes the flames.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carl collapses on the side of his house.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You gave away Kevin. You just gave her away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is none of my concern. I didn't ask for any of this!

	Master. It's alright.

</DUG>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am not your master! And if you hadn't a shown up, none of this would have happened! Bad dog! Bad dog!

Dug slinks off, tail between his legs. Carl angrily puts on the harness.
</DIRECTION>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, whether you assist me or not, I am going to Paradise Falls if it kills me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARL>
<DIRECTION>
He walks off. Russell falls in behind. An angry dawn breaks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MOUNTAIN, ROCKY TERRAIN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now barely aloft, Carl pulls the house across the rocky landscape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Russell's harness drags along side, empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Russell walks behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MOUNTAIN HILLSIDE - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With the last of his energy, Carl drags the house into place. The house groans as it comes to rest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carl drops the hose harness and walks to the edge of a cliff.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARADISE FALLS - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks over. He's finally made it: Paradise Falls. Torrents of water careen over the massive cliff edge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carl takes out Ellie's childhood drawing. Next to him stands the real house, just like Ellie wanted.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Behind him, Russell throws his sash on the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want this anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Russell walks away. He sits on a rock, alone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carl picks up the sash. He walks up the steps of his house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CARL'S HOUSE, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens. Carl steps in. He's back in his house for the first time in days.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carl and Ellie's things are strewn across the floor, a mess from the rough journey.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carl rights Ellie's chair, sets the lamp upright, slides the table into position. He pushes their two chairs back into their place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carl closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, and sits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quiet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing, save the distant sound of the falls outside. Carl surveys the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ADVENTURE BOOK rests on a table near him. He opens it and puts Ellie's drawing back. He looks through the pages, remembering the newspaper clippings and old photographs, the dreams of young Ellie. He turns to the page marked: STUFF I'M GOING TO DO.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carl sighs. He managed to bring the house to the falls, but Ellie never made it. He closes the book. But as he does, Carl sees something he hadn't before.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The blank pages at the end are no longer blank. A WEDDING PHOTO of the two of them. On a picnic. Celebrating birthdays. Another and another... photos of their ordinary life together, the ups and downs. Carl's face warms. Ellie lived the life she wanted: she saw adventure in everyday life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A photo of the two of them sitting side by side, together, in their chairs. Beneath it, Ellie has written:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"THANKS FOR THE ADVENTURE -- NOW GO HAVE A NEW ONE!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOVE, ELLIE." Carl smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks over to Ellie's empty chair. On the arm is Russell's sash. Carl picks it up. He looks to Ellie's chair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He crosses his heart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CARL'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carl walks from the house and calls from the porch.
</DIRECTION>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Russell?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARL>
<DIRECTION>
But Russell is nowhere to be seen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A shadow crosses Carl. He looks up to see Russell floating off, hanging from a BUNCH OF BALLOONS.
</DIRECTION>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Russell!

</CARL>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>

Russell fires up a LEAF BLOWER and steers himself off into the sky.
</DIRECTION>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Russell! No!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Carl runs back to his house and tries in desperation to lift it. He struggles, but the house doesn't budge. The balloons have lost too much helium.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Furious, he THROWS a chair off his porch. It lands atop the mountain rocks with a thud.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This gives him an idea.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO: The GRAMOPHONE smashes onto the rocky ground. Chairs, dressers, tables; Carl throws them all out of the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly, one corner of the house lifts. Then another. Carl struggles to push a refrigerator from the porch. It teeters... and falls. The house lifts off!
</DIRECTION>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wahhoo!
	</DIALOGUE>

The house floats off into the sky, leaving a huge pile of things. Beside it sits Carl and Ellie's chairs, side by side atop Paradise Falls.
