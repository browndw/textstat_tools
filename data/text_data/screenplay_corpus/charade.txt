EXT. FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE -- DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Silence -- complete silence for the urbanite, though the oncoming darkness is punctuated by the sounds of farm country -- a few birds, a distant rumble of thunder from some heavy clouds on the horizon, a dog's barking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PANS the green, squared-off flatland, lit only by a fine sunset in its final throes. Then, gradually, starting from nothing, a rumble is heard, quickly growing louder and louder until the sound of a train can be recognized.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PANS quickly, discovering the railroad line atop a man-made rise of land, and the speeding passenger train is upon us, flashing by with a roar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, as if from nowhere, the figure of a man hits the embankment and rolls crazily down to the bottom into the thick underbrush alongside the tracks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT -- BODY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It lies in the bushes, still, unmoving -- dead. CAMERA PANS AWAY to the quiet peaceful countryside as the sound of the train fades off until there is silence once more.

EXT. MEGEVE -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A handsome and elegant hotel perched on the mountain-side overlooking the French resort town. A large, open sun deck -- tables, gaily colored parasols, sun bathers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the latter is REGINA LAMPERT, a lovely young girl.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is, besides taking in the sun, involved in her favorite activity -- eating.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then -- a dark, ominous shape intrudes in the f.g. FOCUS CHANGES to bring into sharp relief a revolver -- shining, black and ugly in the sunlight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REGGIE, unaware of her danger, continues to eat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The finger tightens around the trigger and finally the gun shoots -- a stream of water arcs, with unerring aim, straight into REGGIE's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Including JEAN-LOUIS, a French boy of six or so. REGGIE looks at him sternly.

WIDER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SYLVIE GAUDET, French, attractive, blonde, in her early thirties, comes from the railing of the sun deck to join REGGIE and JEAN-LOUIS.
</DIRECTION>
<REGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Isn't there something constructive he can do -- like start an avalanche?

<SYLVIE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Va jouer, mon ange.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SYLVIE>
<DIRECTION>
JEAN-LOUIS scampers off, content to have gotten off so lightly. SYLVIE notices REGGIE's lunch which consists of cold chicken, potato salad, rolls and butter, wine and coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<SYLVIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When you start to eat like this something is the matter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SYLVIE>
<DIRECTION>
No answer from REGGIE. SYLVIE begins reading a magazine as REGGIE continues eating.
</DIRECTION>
<REGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sylvie -- I'm getting a divorce.

</REGGIE>
<SYLVIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ã‡a alors! From Charles?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SYLVIE>
<REGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's the only husband I've got. I tried to make it work, I really have -- but --

</REGGIE>
<SYLVIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SYLVIE>
<REGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know how to explain it. I'm just too miserable.

</REGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
REGGIE picks up a chicken leg and starts off. SYLVIE regards the devastated table before following.

	<DIALOGUE>
	It is infuriating that your unhappiness does not turn to fat!

</SYLVIE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SWIMMING POOL -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A magnificent indoor, glass-enclosed pool, the vista of snow- covered mountains seen through the ceiling-high windows beyond. REGGIE and SYLVIE are passing through, their conversation continuing.
</DIRECTION>
<SYLVIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But why do you want a divorce?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SYLVIE>
<REGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I don't love him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REGGIE>
<SYLVIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But that is no reason to get a divorce!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SYLVIE>

EXT. HOTEL TERRACE -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An open balcony running around two sides of the pool, sun- worshippers lying in deck-chairs. REGGIE and SYLVIE appear, their conversation continuing.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I admit I moved to Paris because I was tired of American Provincial,

</REGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	but that doesn't mean I'm ready for French Traditional. I loathe the idea of divorce, Sylvie, but -- if only Charles had been honest with me -- that's all I ask of anybody -- the simple truth. But with him, everything is secrecy and lies. He's hiding something -- something frightening -- something terrible -- and evil.

She stops as she is aware of a weird figure hovering over her. She wheels, terrified.

CLOSE SHOT -- PERUVIAN SNOW-MASK

A strange, grotesque knitted mask that completely covers the face except for eyes, nose and mouth. The eyes inside this particular mask stare down at REGGIE.

<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know -- how would I know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<REGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm afraid I already know a great many people. Until one of them dies I couldn't possibly meet anyone else.

	Yes, of course. But you will let me know if anyone goes on the critical list

</REGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
Eyeing one, then the other, SYLVIE sizes up the situation and rises.
</DIRECTION>
<SYLVIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Viens, Jean-Louis, let us take a walk. I have never seen a Rothschild before.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SYLVIE>

SYLVIE and JEAN-LOUIS start off, but not before the boy squirts PETER with his pistol.

	Clever fellow -- almost missed me.

<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you're honest, anyway.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<REGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I am -- I'm compulsive about it -- dishonesty infuriates me. Like when you go into a drugstore.

<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not sure I --
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<REGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you go in and you ask for some toothpaste -- the small size -- and the man brings you the large size. You tell him you wanted the small size but he says the large size is the small size. I always thought the large size was the largest size, but he says that the family size, the economy size and the giant size are all larger than the large size -- that the large size is the smallest size there is.

The gallery, in complying with his wishes, paid him in cash. One million two hundred and fifty thousand New Francs. In dollars, a quarter of a million. The authorities in Bordeaux have searched his compartment on the train. They have searched it thoroughly. They did not find $250,000, Madame.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDPIERRE>
<DIRECTION>
He opens the desk drawer, puts the cigar back in his mouth and lights a match by scratching it against the glass desk- top before he remembers REGGIE's request. He puts it back in the drawer again. The door opens and the POLICEMAN enters again, this time carrying a wicker basket which he deposits on GRANDPIERRE's desk, and leaves. GRANDPIERRE peers into the basket.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANDPIERRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These few things are all that was found in the train compartment. There was no other baggage. Your husband must have been in a great hurry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDPIERRE>
<DIRECTION>
He begins to take them out, placing them on the desk, identifying each item as he does.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANDPIERRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One wallet containing four thousand francs -- one agenda --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pausing, he opens the notebook)

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why there?

</GRANDPIERRE>
<REGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. Perhaps he met somebody.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REGGIE>
<GRANDPIERRE>
<DIRECTION>
(dryly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Obviously.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(returning to the items in the basket)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One ticket of passage to South America -- one letter, stamped but unsealed, addressed to you --
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDPIERRE>
<REGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
(lighting up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A letter? May I see it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
GRANDPIERRE hands her the letter and watches her closely as she reads it.
</DIRECTION>
<REGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
(reading)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"My dear Regina: I hope you are enjoying your holiday. Megeve can be so lovely this time of year. The days pass very slowly and I hope to see you soon. As always, Charles. P.S. Your dentist called yesterday. Your appointment has been changed."
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she looks up, puzzled)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not very much, is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REGGIE>
<GRANDPIERRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We took the liberty of calling your dentist -- we thought, perhaps, we would learn something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDPIERRE>
<REGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REGGIE>
<GRANDPIERRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Your appointment has been changed.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he smiles at his
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	little joke, then
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
returns to the basket)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One key to your apartment -- one comb -- one fountain pen -- one toothbrush -- one tin of tooth powder
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he looks up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- that is all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDPIERRE>
<DIRECTION>
He slides a sheet of paper and pen across to her, then starts to put the things back into the basket while he speaks:
</DIRECTION>
<GRANDPIERRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you will sign this list you may take the things with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDPIERRE>
<REGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
(sighing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that all? Can I go now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REGGIE>
<GRANDPIERRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One more question. Is this your husband's passport?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDPIERRE>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches into the desk drawer and pulls out a passport which he hands to her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT -- PASSPORT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cover indicates that it is Swiss. REGGIE's hand opens it to a picture of a man -- the man we saw in GRANDPIERRE's photo. Under it is the name: "CHARLES LAMPERT."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. SHOT -- REGGIE AND GRANDPIERRE
</DIRECTION>
<REGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course it is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REGGIE>
<GRANDPIERRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDPIERRE>
<DIRECTION>
He hands her another passport.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT -- SECOND PASSPORT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cover is American. When it is opened, we see the identical picture, but the name under it reads: "CHARLES VOSS."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. SHOT -- REGGIE AND GRANDPIERRE
</DIRECTION>
<REGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't understand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REGGIE>
<GRANDPIERRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And this? And this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDPIERRE>
<DIRECTION>
He hands her, one at a time, two more passports.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT -- THIRD AND FOURTH PASSPORTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One is Italian which, when opened, shows the same photo with the name "CARLO FABRI." The other is Venezuelan, the same photo, and the name "CARLOS MORENO."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. SHOT -- REGGIE AND GRANDPIERRE
</DIRECTION>
<GRANDPIERRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you nothing to say, Madame?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDPIERRE>
<DIRECTION>
REGGIE looks down at the four passports, then back to GRANDPIERRE.
</DIRECTION>
<REGGIE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all right if you want to smoke your cigar now.

INT. LAMPERT APARTMENT -- DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The house is empty as before. Now it is silent, the late afternoon light coming from outside. REGGIE stands by a window. A canvas airline bag rests on the floor nearby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly there is the noise of a DOOR OPENING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER SHOT -- REGGIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As her head turns, in alarm, toward the noise. There is a moment of silence, then FOOTSTEPS are heard, coming closer.

(surprised)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REGGIE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I phoned but nobody answered. I wanted to tell you how sorry I am -- and to find out if there was anything I could do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<REGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did you find out?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REGGIE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's in all the afternoon papers. I'm very sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<REGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
A silence.

<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I rang the bell but I don't think it's working.

</PETER>
<REGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes it is -- I heard it this morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
He looks around for the light switch, then goes to it and flicks it on -- nothing happens. He flicks it a few more times.
</DIRECTION>
<REGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They must have turned off the electricity.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REGGIE>

She shakes her head. PETER looks around.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where did everything go?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<REGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Charles sold it all -- at auction.

</REGGIE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know what you're going to do?

</PETER>
<REGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Try and get my old job back at UNESCO, I suppose.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REGGIE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doing what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<REGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a simultaneous translator -- like Sylvie, only she's English to French -- I'm French to English. That's what I did before I married Charles. The police probably think I killed him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REGGIE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Instant divorce you mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<REGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something like that. But I'm sorry it ended like this -- tossed off a train like a sack of third-class mail.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REGGIE>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(Taking her hand)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on. You can't stay here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<REGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know where to go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REGGIE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll find you a hotel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<REGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not too expensive -- I'm not a lady of leisure anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REGGIE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something modest but clean -- and near enough to UNESCO so you can take a cab when it rains -- okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<DIRECTION>
She nods. He picks up the airlines bag and they start out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REGGIE stops at the door and looks back.
</DIRECTION>
<REGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I loved this room -- but Charles never saw it -- only what was in it. All those exquisite things --

INT. FUNERAL CHAPEL -- DAY
</DIRECTION>

CLOSE SHOT of a phonograph. A hand appears, starts the record on it spinning, then places the arm at the beginning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An instant later ORGAN MUSIC starts with a roar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FUNERAL CHAPEL -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of the coffin. It rests on a low platform, with a bouquet or two of flowers near the head, the lid open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside, the face made up to look lifelike (but failing), lie the remnants of Charles Lampert.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT -- GRANDPIERRE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The INSPECTOR sits quietly, eyes downcast, staring at his hands in a prayer-like attitude. CAMERA PULLS BACK, revealing row after row of empty wooden bench-like seats in the large, dimly-lit, high-ceilinged room. Finally, in the first row, REGGIE and SYLVIE are discovered. Besides GRANDPIERRE, they are the only ones present. REGGIE turns around to look at the empty room. They speak in whispers.
</DIRECTION>
<REGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not exactly what I'd call a large turn-out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REGGIE>
<SYLVIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't Charles have any friends?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SYLVIE>
<REGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't ask me -- I'm only the widow.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(indicating GRANDPIERRE)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If Charles had died in bed we wouldn't even have him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REGGIE>
<SYLVIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At least he knows how to behave at funerals.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SYLVIE>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT -- GRANDPIERRE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes still lowered. CAMERA PANS DOWN to feature his hands -- he is methodically trimming his nails with a small clipper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO SHOT -- SYLVIE AND REGGIE
</DIRECTION>
<SYLVIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you no idea who could have done it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SYLVIE>
<REGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Until two days ago all I really knew about Charles was his name -- now it turns out I didn't even know that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
The front DOOR of the Chapel is heard opening and a shaft of daylight streams in. The WOMEN turn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. SHOT -- CHAPEL DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The short, heavy-set figure of a MAN is outlined against the bright outdoor light. He stands for a moment, then closes the door after him. LEOPOLD GIDEON, short-sighted, bald, in his middle forties, glances around nervously, like a barnyard bird. Then he walks down one of the side aisles of the Chapel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT -- GRANDPIERRE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he watches GIDEON.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she watches him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. SHOT -- THE BIER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GIDEON arrives at the coffin. He stops, looks down at LAMPERT's body for a moment. Then, suddenly, in rapid succession, he sneezes six times. He takes a small bottle from his pocket, shakes a pill from it and swallows it dry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns and walks back up the aisle, looking for a place to sit. He comes face to face with GRANDPIERRE, stops, turns to sit somewhere else.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND SYLVIE
</DIRECTION>
<SYLVIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SYLVIE>
<REGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've never seen him before.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REGGIE>
<SYLVIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He must have known Charles pretty well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SYLVIE>
<REGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How can you tell?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REGGIE>
<SYLVIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's allergic to him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SYLVIE>
<DIRECTION>
SYLVIE turns and glances at GIDEON. Again, the sound of the DOOR opening interrupts them. They turn to look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. SHOT -- CHAPEL DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Again the figure of a MAN is outlined in silhouette against the outside brightness. When he closes the door we can see "TEX" PENTHOLLOW, a slim, rangy man with sandy-colored hair, a weatherbeaten face, washed-out blue-eyes -- also in his forties. He wears a velvet-corduroy suit, string tie and a bright yellow flower in his lapel. A bulldurham tag hangs from his outside breast pocket, dangling from its string.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He starts down the aisle toward the bier, CAMERA LEADING him, and we notice his unsteady gait. He turns to look at the others present.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRAVELING SHOT -- TEX'S P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVING down the aisle. GRANDPIERRE's face, then GIDEON's, then REGGIE's and SYLVIE's -- all staring at CAMERA.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. SHOT -- THE BIER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As TEX arrives. He stands staring at LAMPERT's body, swaying on his feet until he reaches out and grabs the side of the coffin to steady himself. Then he takes the flower from his lapel and throws it into the open box.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT -- TEX
</DIRECTION>
<TEX>

<DIRECTION>
WIDER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As TEX turns away from the coffin and approaches REGGIE and SYLVIE, addressing the latter -- after having first reached for his hat which he discovers he isn't wearing.
</DIRECTION>
<TEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miz Lampert, ma'am...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TEX>
<DIRECTION>
SYLVIE points to REGGIE. Unruffled, TEX starts over. addressing REGGIE this time.
</DIRECTION>
<TEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miz Lampert, ma'am...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TEX>
<REGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes?

</REGGIE>
<TEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Charlie had no call to handling it this-a-way. He sure didn't. No siree.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TEX>
<REGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't understa--
	</DIALOGUE>
</REGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
But TEX has nodded his head and moved off to find a seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When he spots GIDEON, the two men stare at each other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, TEX chooses a seat away from him and sits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. SHOT -- CHAPEL DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It flies open, this time with a bang, and the large MAN who appears almost fills the frame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER SHOT -- TEX
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the loud noise awakens him with a snort, mid-snore.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. SHOT -- THE DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Closing the door, we see HERMAN SCOBIE, a heavy-weight -- tall and wide, but not fat -- with black hair combed straight back and heavy bushy eyebrows of a matching color, which meet over his nose and join up. About the same age as the first two men, SCOBIE is dressed in a battered raincoat, his hands thrust deep in the pockets. He marches down the aisle. Looking straight ahead, CAMERA PANNING with him. He stops before the coffin and stares into it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT -- SCOBIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he stares down into the coffin, his tongue trying to dislodge a bit of food caught in his teeth. He stares hard at the body, squinting his eyes. Then he removes one hand from his pocket, removes a pin from the inside of his lapel, picks his teeth with it, then slowly lets the hand down, into the coffin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT -- SCOBIE'S HAND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pin held between thumb and forefinger, he jabs it slowly but positively deep into the back of one of the dead man's hands. There is no reaction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT -- SCOBIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He watches the dead man carefully, still squinting. Then finally satisfied, he returns the pin to his lapel and walks back up the aisle and out of the door, slamming it after him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Having watched SCOBIE exit. Suddenly a hand falls on her shoulder. She jumps in alarm and utters a little cry of fright.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Featuring a funeral ATTENDANT, a cadaverous type (aren't they all) with a black cut-away coat and an over-solicitous, unctuous manner. He is eternally bent at the waist, in a sort of half bow. He offers REGGIE a letter which she takes.
</DIRECTION>
<REGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Merci, Monsieur.

<ATTENDANT>
	<DIALOGUE>

INT. BARTHOLOMEW'S OUTER OFFICE -- DAY

The office is empty, the typewriter on the secretary's desk is covered with its plastic shroud. REGGIE enters, looks for somebody, notices that the door to the private office is slightly ajar.

</REGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
BARTHOLOMEW comes to the door and looks in. He is a pale grey-haired man who looks, on first examination, older than his forty-odd years. Sickly would be the word that describes him best -- pallid, consumptive-looking. He wears heavy tortoise-framed glasses which fall down his nose and cause him to push them back in place every so often with a quick automatic motion.
</DIRECTION>
<BARTHOLOMEW>

INT. BARTHOLOMEW'S PRIVATE OFFICE -- DAY

A small cubicle -- there is a silver-framed photo of three kids on the desk. BARTHOLOMEW indicates a chair, then goes behind his desk and sits. A can of lighter fluid stands open on the desk and a crumpled hankie beside it.

<BARTHOLOMEW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me for a moment, Mrs. Lampert -- it's a stubborn little devil.

He works at a stain on his necktie with lighter fluid and hankie.

<BARTHOLOMEW>

One of the French Punch and Judy shows set up on certain days in the small park alongside the broad avenue between the Rond Point and the Place de la Concorde. At the moment, Judy, as always, is beating Punch with a bat. The sound of CHILDREN laughing and screaming can be heard.

VARIOUS CLOSE SHOTS -- THE CHILDREN

MED. SHOT -- REGGIE

Sitting on the last bench, next to some CHILDREN. They are laughing but she isn't -- she just watches, her attention caught up but her face void of emotion. The bench is too low for her, forcing her knees up almost under her chin.

<EMCEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ã‰coutez bien -- les rÃ¨gles sont tres simples -- the rules are very easy -- deux Ã©quipes -- two teams -- each with one orange -- une orange -- eine apfelsine -- un' arrancia -- held under the chin, like so --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(does it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	comme Ã§a -- and passed to the player behind you -- sans vous servir de vos mains -- using nothing but the chin -- no hands -- and keeping the orange at all costs from touching the floor. Commencez, Mesdames et Messieurs -- begin, ladies and gentlemen -- signore e signori, comminciate!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMCEE>
<DIRECTION>
The EMCEE now circulates, forming teams, telling the patrons to line up, making sure there is a woman next to every man. REGGIE and PETER are the second couple in their line.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then the EMCEE picks up a basket of oranges and places one under the chin, held securely against the chest, of each man at the head of the line. Blowing a whistle, a signal for the game to begin and the band to play, the men turn to the women behind them and attempt to transfer the oranges from under their chins to under the chins of the women -- without using their hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(This maneuver can only be accomplished by embracing one's partner passionately and firmly pressing the orange against the partner's throat until he or she can grip it tightly enough with the chin to turn and offer it to the person next in line, where the process begins anew. However, the slightest miscalculation, which can be brought about by any number of human frailties -- haste, modesty, inhibition or lack of co- ordination -- will surely result in losing control of the orange so that it either falls to the floor [where it can only be picked up by the chin] or it starts to roll and slide from its proper place to some other, less proper, spot on the human anatomy, forcing the man or the woman to retrieve it -- again, with the chin only. This latter is an activity which can prove extremely satisfying to old friends, or even new friends who wish to become old friends, but can only be a torment for total strangers and/or the English).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VARIOUS SHOTS -- ORANGE GAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Some of the couples in various states of confusion, entanglement and intimacy -- all of them, naturally, hilarious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO SHOT -- PETER AND GIRL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is his turn to take the orange from a very short, but quite shapely young girl in a strapless dress (held up by an abundance of cantilever). PETER 'takes' when he sees the twin obstacles which might -- and probably will -- encumber the game but increase his worldly experience.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The contest begins: because of her stature he is forced to move in low, making the ordinary embrace needed for success difficult, if not impossible. Then, inexorably, the orange starts to slip down the GIRL's front. Manfully he goes after it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is enjoying it thoroughly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO SHOT -- PETER AND GIRL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bending over backwards, in a sort of frontal half-nelson, PETER makes a last valiant effort and voilÃ , grips the orange under his chin -- amid much cheering and congratulations from members of his TEAM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now he turns to REGGIE and they face one another for a moment.

They go at it, working their bodies together to make it all possible. Then, for a moment, the game and the onlookers seem less important than their proximity. But, alas, they are too good despite themselves and the transfer is accomplished -- again with appreciative cheers from the TEAM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REGGIE, with the orange now tucked firmly under her chin, turns to the next team-member in line and is locked in an embrace before she realizes her partner is LEOPOLD GIDEON, the short, fat, balding man seen at the funeral and later in BARTHOLOMEW's photo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REGGIE starts to draw back but GIDEON holds her tightly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Putting his chin around the orange he is able to speak quietly in REGGIE's ear.
</DIRECTION>

CLOSE TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND GIDEON

Her eyes show her fright as he whispers:

As REGGIE hauls off and kicks GIDEON full in the shin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT -- GIDEON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stiffens as the pain registers. Instead of shouting he merely closes his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Including REGGIE and GIDEON and PETER standing by, as well as some spectators. PETER comes quickly forward.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Reggie -- what's the trouble?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<DIRECTION>
REGGIE realizes that GIDEON no longer offers any resistance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She steps back, leaving GIDEON holding the orange, foolishly, under his chin, his eyes still closed. REGGIE stares at him for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<REGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He -- he was stepping on my foot.

CLOSE SHOT -- GIDEON

Slowly, his eyes open and tears stream from them, rolling down his cheeks. He speaks while holding the orange.

INT. NIGHTCLUB LOUNGE -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small, dimly lit area with a door to the combination men's- women's room and a 'phone cabin with a solid door.
</DIRECTION>

The music and shouting from upstairs float down. REGGIE comes down the stairs and goes to the 'phone, flicking on the light and closing the door after her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REGGIE takes a jeton ('phone token) from her bag and drops it in the slot. Then she takes out a slip of paper (the one given her by BARTHOLOMEW) and dials the number written on it. She listens to it ring, then evidently he answers.

Suddenly the door of the booth opens and REGGIE wheels to look, slamming the receiver down as she does.

<DIRECTION>
REVERSE SHOT -- 'PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TEX PENTHOLLOW, the second man from the funeral (and photo), the man in the corduroy suit and string tie, stands in the doorway, his face calm, a hand-rolled but unlit cigarette in his mouth. He has put one foot up against the side of the door so she can't leave. REGGIE stares at him, terrified.

<REGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know what --

</REGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
TEX, without a word, throws the still-lit match into the booth, onto REGGIE's lap. She beats it out frantically.
</DIRECTION>
<REGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REGGIE>

TEX lights another match and throws it into her lap. She beats this one out too.

He lights another match and reaches out toward her hair with it. She shrinks back.
</DIRECTION>
<TEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It could get a whole lot worse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TEX>
<DIRECTION>
Then he throws it into her lap. As he continues to speak he punctuates each phrase or so with another lit match. REGGIE is too busy beating them out to do anything else.
</DIRECTION>
<TEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It belongs to me, Miz Lampert -- an' if you don't give it to me your life ain't gonna be worth the paper it's printed on. You savvy what I'm sayin', Miz Lampert?

As REGGIE returns, sits and starts to put another jeton into the slot. She notices her hand is shaking. She reaches back into her bag, removes a piece of candy, puts it into her mouth and leans her head back against the wall, closing her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the door opens and REGGIE shrieks -- but this time it is PETER.

They go to the elevator where he opens the door for her.

As REGGIE and PETER enter the small cage. It is somewhat cramped, forcing them to stand close together.

The room has been torn apart. And standing in the center is HERMAN SCOBIE, the large man in the battered raincoat.

SCOBIE sees where REGGIE is staring; looks down at it himself, then lunges at her, raising the hand to strike.

	I want it -- give it to me -- it's mine!

As REGGIE runs out, slamming the door after her, the metal hand crashes against the wooden panel inside the door and splinters through it, visible on this side now. Petrified with fear, REGGIE can only stare dumbly at the protruding claw.

Pulling her aside, PETER takes hold of the key (still in the outside lock) and turns it slowly and quietly. Then, using all his weight, he slams the door open as far as it will go, making sure to hold it that way as he steps in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

Inside, PETER pulls back the door and slugs the startled SCOBIE full on the jaw. His head bangs against the wall but he manages to raise a foot and push PETER violently away, sending him sprawling back, toppling across the bed and over, head first, onto the floor on the other side, where he disappears. Hurrying, SCOBIE puts his foot against the door and pushes it away, ripping his metal hand free.

He then rushes to the open window and climbs out.

EXT. HOTEL WINDOW THIRD FLOOR -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

	Mrs. Lampert, I really hadn't planned on spending the entire night here.

	Can I at least keep the onion soup?

BARTHOLOMEW shrugs.

The WAITER nods and goes.

(anxiously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go on, please -- five men -- $250,000 -- the French Underground --
	</DIALOGUE>
</REGGIE>
<BARTHOLOMEW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. The five men. They were, of course, your husband, Charles, the three men who showed up at his funeral yesterday, and Carson Dyle. But something went wrong and they were unable to locate their contact. It must have been at that point that they decided to steal the money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARTHOLOMEW>
<REGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Steal it how?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REGGIE>
<BARTHOLOMEW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By burying it, and then reporting that the Germans had captured it. All they had to do was come back after the war, dig it up and split it five ways -- a quarter of a million dollars with no questions asked.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARTHOLOMEW>
<REGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
(fascinated)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	May I have a cigarette, please?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
BARTHOLOMEW pulls out a package and she takes one, looks at it and rips off the filter tip. He winces.
</DIRECTION>
<REGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hate these things -- it's like drinking coffee through a veil.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
She puts the other end in her mouth, then picks up the matches and lights it.
</DIRECTION>
<BARTHOLOMEW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everything went smoothly enough until after the gold was buried -- then, before they could get out, they were ambushed by a German patrol. A machine gun separated Scobie from his right hand -- and caught Carson Dyle full in the stomach.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARTHOLOMEW>
<DIRECTION>
REGGIE takes another cigarette from his pack, rips off the filter (he winces again) and puts it into her mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<BARTHOLOMEW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's wrong with that one?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARTHOLOMEW>
<DIRECTION>
He points to the cigarette she just lit, still practically brand-new in the ashtray.
</DIRECTION>
<REGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Nothing, I guess. What happened then?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
She hands over the newer one to BARTHOLOMEW, who sadly examines its mutilated end while REGGIE returns to the first cigarette.
</DIRECTION>
<BARTHOLOMEW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you any idea what these things cost over here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARTHOLOMEW>
<REGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please go on, Mr. Bartholomew -- what happened then?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REGGIE>
<BARTHOLOMEW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Scobie was able to travel, but Carson Dyle was clearly dying, so they --

	</DIALOGUE>
</REGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
The WAITER puts down the cup and bowl and leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<BARTHOLOMEW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Carson was dying so they were forced to leave him. They finally got back to the base, made their report, and waited for the war to end. Only Charles couldn't wait quite as long as the others. He beat them back to the gold, took everything for himself and disappeared. It's taken Gideon, Tex and Scobie all this time to catch up with him again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARTHOLOMEW>
<REGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But if they stole all that money -- why can't you arrest them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REGGIE>
<BARTHOLOMEW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We know what happened from the bits and pieces we were able to paste together -- but we still have no proof.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARTHOLOMEW>
<REGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But what has all this got to do with the C.I.O.?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REGGIE>
<BARTHOLOMEW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C.I.A., Mrs. Lampert. We're an extension of the wartime O.S.S. It was our money and we want it back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARTHOLOMEW>
<REGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, Mr. Bartholomew, but nothing you've told me has changed my mind. I still intend leaving Paris -- tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REGGIE>
<BARTHOLOMEW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wouldn't advise that, Mrs. Lampert. You'd better consider what happened to your husband when he tried to leave. Those men won't be very far away -- no matter where you go. In fact, I don't even see any point in your changing hotels. Please help us, Mrs. Lampert. Your government is counting on you.
	</DIALOGUE>

	Well, if I'm going to die, I might as well do it for my country.

<BARTHOLOMEW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're anxious to know who this man is -- the one calling himself Dyle.

<REGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe he really is Dyle. He could still be alive.

<BARTHOLOMEW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Mrs. Lampert.

EXT. HOTEL (PLACE ST. ANDRÃ‰ DES ARTS) -- LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DYLE leaves the hotel and turns into the Place. A moment later, REGGIE comes cautiously from the hotel. As she watches DYLE, a SANDWICH-MAN advertising a driving school passes the hotel. REGGIE falls in behind him, his tall placard hiding her from view.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PLACE ST. ANDRÃ‰ DES ARTS -- LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
First comes DYLE, passing a sidewalk cafe on the corner, then the SANDWICH-MAN and REGGIE. The SANDWICH-MAN turns off, leaving REGGIE out in the open. A moment later, DYLE passes a GIRL painting a canvas, her easel set up in the middle of the sidewalk. He stops when he has passed her and turns to look at her work. REGGIE, not knowing what to do, and afraid she will be seen by DYLE, who is now looking her way, spins and sits at the sidewalk cafe's nearest table, her back to DYLE. It is already occupied by a middle-aged TOURIST.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND TOURIST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The TOURIST, complete with camera, beret and guide book, looks up from his coffee, surprised. He stares at REGGIE and she stares back. Finally, not knowing what else to do, she smiles, then takes a portion of his brioche and eats it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He smiles back emptily, not knowing what to make of her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REGGIE turns to look at DYLE.
</DIRECTION>

MED. SHOT -- DYLE

<DIRECTION>
He has made his judgment of the painting and now moves on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND TOURIST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The TOURIST has finally found the courage to speak. As he opens his mouth to make a sound, REGGIE, her eyes on DYLE, rises quickly from the table and goes, leaving a very confused TOURIST with his mouth open. He blinks, then leaves some money on the table and starts after her.
</DIRECTION>

She continues after DYLE. The TOURIST hesitates, then continues after her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. SHOT -- DYLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He goes to the curb and starts to step off, attempting to cross the Rue Danton, but finds the light against him. He turns back in REGGIE's direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. SHOT -- REGGIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Realizing she has to do something before DYLE spots her, she turns and takes the TOURIST's arm and starts walking with him back toward the cafe.
</DIRECTION>
<REGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling and rattling on)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

DYLE has hopped on the back of the bus as it pulls away.

A spectacular view of the Paris rooftops and the city lights beyond. DYLE and SCOBIE come out onto a level portion of roof. On the street side, the roof angles down abruptly into a steep, slate-covered pitch, broken only by two widely separated oval-shaped dormer windows.
</DIRECTION>

Below these is a rain gutter, then nothing -- for seven stories.

	Very pretty. Now what?

	Is that why you dragged me all the way up here -- to ask me that? She has it -- you know that.

	And I say maybe you both have it! One more time, Dyle -- where is it?

	Supposing I did have it -- which I don't -- do you really think I'd hand it over?

</DIRECTION>
<SCOBIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Step back.

DYLE turns and looks -- there is nothing behind him but a sheer drop to the street.

<DYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Back where?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DYLE>
<SCOBIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the idea.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOBIE>
<DIRECTION>
Moving quickly, DYLE lashes out and hacks SCOBIE's gun hand with the side of his palm and the gun falls to the roof.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Following through, DYLE punches the large man full in the jaw, but instead of falling, SCOBIE wraps his arm around DYLE, holding on tightly until his head clears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, to his amazement, DYLE is lifted into the air and, unable to break the bear-hold, carried toward the edge of the roof. Working his arms between their two bodies, DYLE suddenly flails them out with all his strength and the hold is broken, but at the price of his coat and the flesh on his back as SCOBIE's metal claw rips through both, a wound extending from the center of DYLE's back to his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Both men look around for the gun, spot it simultaneously and leap for it, both landing short of the mark. Now they grapple with one another, each trying to break free and reach for the gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT -- THEIR HANDS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two hands, one real, one metal, inch toward the gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. SHOT -- DYLE AND SCOBIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The battle is going to SCOBIE whose weight and strength are beginning to tire DYLE, who is now on his back, trying to stop SCOBIE from crawling over him. He has the large man by both lapels of the raincoat in a last-ditch effort to hold him. But SCOBIE, his face horribly distorted from the strain, continues to inch forward toward the gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, DYLE releases his hold. With nothing restraining him, SCOBIE lurches forward, tumbling past the gun, his momentum carrying him onto the sloping part of the roof, where he begins sliding down. SCOBIE beats wildly at the the slate with his claw, trying to gouge a grip.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT -- SCOBIE'S CLAW

The HOTEL MANAGER is busy taping a piece of cardboard over the hole ripped in REGGIE's door by SCOBIE's metal hand the night before. DYLE leaves the elevator and goes to his own door. The MANAGER eyes him coldly. DYLE "takes" the look.

INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

REGGIE, smoking on the bed, sits up when she hears DYLE moving about in his room. She goes to the connecting door, unlocks her side, tries the knob, finds it still bolted from his side and knocks.

</REGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
As REGGIE goes to the bathroom, DYLE takes off his torn shirt, revealing a torn and bloody T-shirt. He lies face downwards on the bed. REGGIE returns, carrying cotton, gauze, tape, scissors, and disinfectant. She sits next to him and lifts up his T-shirt to examine the wound.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen -- all I really want is an estimate.

</DYLE>
<REGGIE>

	It's not so bad. You may not be able to lie on your back for a few days -- but, then, you can lie from any position, can't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REGGIE>

She wets the cotton with disinfectant and begins cleaning the wound. He winces.

</REGGIE>
<DYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't.

<REGGIE>

	There must be some way.

</REGGIE>
<DYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's an old riddle about two tribes of Indians -- the Whitefeet always tell the truth and the Blackfeet always lie. So one day you meet an Indian, you ask him if he's a truthful Whitefoot or a lying Blackfoot? He tells you he's a truthful Whitefoot, but which one is he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DYLE>
<REGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why couldn't you just look at his feet?

<DYLE>

</DYLE>
<REGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Well, then he's a truthful Whitefoot, of course.

</DYLE>
<REGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Said what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REGGIE>
<DYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Serious. When a man gets to be my age that's the last word he ever wants to hear. I don't want to be serious -- and I especially don't want you to be.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DYLE>
<REGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay -- I'll tell you what -- we'll just sit around all day long being frivolous -- how about that?

He goes first to the drawer in the night table -- empty; and the bed, looking in it and under it. Then he goes to the desk and opens the drawers -- also empty.

The elevator passes out of sight, still going down. There is a silence as the motor stops, and then a series of sneezes that ends with a terrifying shriek. The NIGHT PORTER, rudely awakened, runs to the elevator shaft, his shoes squeaking horribly. He looks up, sees nothing, then looks down. He presses the call button and the motor starts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An instant later the cage appears and stops. The NIGHT PORTER opens the gate, pulls back the grill and the CAMERA RUSHES PAST him to pick up GIDEON. His body is sitting on the floor of the cage, its grotesque sprawling attitude resembling a puppet's with its strings cut. Except that GIDEON has no strings to cut -- only a throat. From ear to ear.

Per esempio, pregare i Vietnamiti di aggiungere alle loro risaie ed ai loro campi di soja tradizionali una raccolta di semola, non solo sconvolgerebbe le loro secolari tradizioni ma, oltre tutto, e questo Ã¨ molto importante per il Governo che io ho l'onore di rappresentare disturberebbe l'esportazione delle derrate farinose italiane in questa parte del mondo.

<BRITISH_DELEGATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Chairman, fellow delegates -- my distinguished colleague from Italy. Her Majesty's delegation has listened with great patience to the Southern European position on this problem, and while we find it charmingly stated, we cannot possibly agree with its content. In 1937, in the British colonies of Kenya, Uganda and Tanganyika -- and, if I'm not mistaken, more or less in Somaliland -- a programme of crop rotation was instituted vis-Ã -vis arable land which had never before known the plough, beginning before the soil was able to know the sort of fatigue now plaguing most of Western Europe. In 1937, therefore, Her Majesty's Government -- at that time His Majesty's Government -- was able to properly assay the situation. We therefore oppose the resolution.

From REGGIE'S P.O.V. as ADAM walks away from CAMERA, down

As REGGIE wearily gains the top, ADAM lunges for her. He manages to grab her foot as he falls forward, but all he winds up with is a shoe which has come loose in his hand.
</DIRECTION>

REGGIE shrieks, then regaining her balance, continues running, limping in her one shoe. ADAM scrambles to his feet and starts after her again.
</DIRECTION>

INT. MÃ‰TRO TICKET BOOTH AREA -- NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
EXT. PLACE PALAIS ROYAL -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As REGGIE comes up the stairs from the MÃ©tro. She stops long enough to kick off her other shoe, then runs across the street, ignoring the traffic, toward the Rue de Valois (which forms one side of the Palais Royal). ADAM is gaining on her again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PALAIS ROYAL COURTYARD -- COLONNADE -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The smaller court at the ComÃ©die-FranÃ§aise end of the Palais gardens, separated from the larger garden by a double peristyle consisting of two twin rows (these separated from each other by a small marble court) of twenty columns each -- in all, eighty columns. The only person in sight is the man we have known as BARTHOLOMEW, waiting at the far end of the columns, looking at his watch impatiently.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, from the Rue de Valois side of the Palais, REGGIE runs into the court. She spots "BARTHOLOMEW" and fishes in her bag for the stamps as she runs, taking them out and waving them.
</DIRECTION>
<REGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Bartholomew -- he's chasing me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</REGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
ADAM has run into the court and now skids to a stop at the near end of the colonnade as he spots "BARTHOLOMEW." REGGIE, still running, is halfway between the two men. "BARTHOLOMEW" draws his gun but can't get a shot at ADAM, who has ducked in among the columns.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Reggie -- stop! That's Carson Dyle!

This news hits REGGIE hard and she stops, in alarm.

</REGGIE>

She looks at "BARTHOLOMEW," then back at ADAM, who has drawn his own gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(NOTE: Both "BARTHOLOMEW" and ADAM are in among the stone columns at opposite ends of the colonnade, keeping out of each other's sight. REGGIE stands out in the open, the stamps in her hand, confused as to which man she should go to).

	We all know Carson Dyle is dead, Mrs. Lampert.

	It's Carson Dyle, I tell you!

<BARTHOLOMEW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not going to believe him, Mrs. Lampert -- it's too fantastic. He's trying to trick you again.

</BARTHOLOMEW>
<DIRECTION>
REGGIE looks at one, then the other, not knowing what to do.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tex recognized him -- that's why he said Dyle. If you give him those stamps, he'll kill you too!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
REGGIE takes a step toward ADAM.
</DIRECTION>
<BARTHOLOMEW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mrs. Lampert -- if I'm who he said, what's preventing me from killing you right now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARTHOLOMEW>
<DIRECTION>
REGGIE stops, turns back to "BARTHOLOMEW."
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because he'd have to come out to get the stamps -- he knows he'd never make it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<BARTHOLOMEW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the matter with you, Mrs. Lampert? Are you going to believe every lie he tells you? He wants the money for himself -- that's all he's ever wanted.

	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<BARTHOLOMEW>
<DIRECTION>
(now called CARSON)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe not -- but it takes a lot of bullets to kill me. They left me there with five of them in my legs and my stomach -- they knew I was still alive but they left me. I spent ten months in a German camp -- with nothing to stop the pain and no food -- they were willing to take all these chances for the money, but not for me. They deserved to die!

During this ADAM has moved out from behind the columns, creeping cautiously across the open space between the two colonnades and finally, behind the second.

<CARSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll give you five to make up your mind, Mrs. Lampert.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quickly, he peers back out and throws another shot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. SHOT -- REGGIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seeing CARSON otherwise occupied, she turns and runs toward the open stage door of the ComÃ©die FranÃ§aise behind her.

(Beside the door is a poster announcing the forthcoming schedule of presentations.)

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. SHOT -- ADAM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Over his shoulder we see a broken picture of CARSON running toward the theatre door, flashing by the near and far columns. ADAM tries to get a shot at him, but can't.

Finally he runs after him.

As CARSON moves carefully across the darkened stage near the footlights, looking for REGGIE. At mid-stage, CAMERA PANS DOWN to his feet, only a few inches from the prompter's box. Inside, huddling down, is a terrified REGGIE, holding her breath as she watches him.

INT. TRAPROOM -- NIGHT

ADAM is looking up, having heard the footsteps on the stage over his head -- and hearing them now. He looks around and sees a narrow, curving staircase leading up. He goes to it, and, starting up, finds a door. He tries the knob -- the door is locked.
