A gorgeous, olive-skinned goddess enters the outer foyer. It takes us a moment to realize that the skin-tight dress she's wearing isn't a dress at all, but rather her entire naked body has been PAINTED in the ancient Egyptian manner She's a stunning sight to behold. This is ANCK-SU-NAMUN.

Strange LIGHT suddenly FLASHES across Anck-su-namun's body and across the faces of the slaves and the EGYPTIAN SOLDIERS Suddenly, everyone's fear-filled eyes all rise, as if watching Anck-su-namun's body rising. Then one last HUGE FLASH, accompanied by a BLAST OF WIND, and it's over. Anck-su-namun's body now lies twisted on the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Imhotep's Priests place the body into a stone sarcophagus. The Nubian slaves lower it into a hole and bury it with sand Imhotep then signals to the Soldiers, who throw their spears at the Nubians. Killing them.

CHARIOTS race out into the moonlit desert. Imhotep leads the way. A "hearse" carries Anck-su-namun's mummy. THE MAP OF ANCIENT EGYPT FADES UP. The chariots race across the map.
</DIRECTION>

INT- UNDERGROUND NECROPOLIS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Big hairy RATS scurry through the mausoleums and over the headstones of this very large, scary, UNDERGROUND CEMETERY. A DETRITUS MOAT surrounds the cemetery, --muck made out of filthy water and human remains. Skulls bob in the goop. The Priests have gathered in a circle. Their hooded, lifeless eyes seem dead to this world. Their bald heads rock back and forth as they CHANT, a quiet eerie HUM. Heinous creatures. In the middle of the circle is a strange, twisted ALTAR.' Imhotep has unwrapped Anck-su-namun's gorgeous, lifeless body and placed her five sacred canopic jars around her.
</DIRECTION>
<IMHOTEP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anck-su-namun's vital organs were still fresh, so a human sacrifice would not need be made
	</DIALOGUE>
</IMHOTEP>
<DIRECTION>
As Imhotep begins to read from The Book of The Dead, a large SWIRLING HOLE starts to open in the detritus bog. Several Priests look over at it, frightened, then quickly look back down and resume CHANTING. A strange MIST wafts up out of the swirling hole and over to the jars, it passes through them and into Anck-su-namun's body. One of the jars SHUDDERS, the heart inside begins to BEAT. The CHANTING PRIESTS, SWIRLING HOLE, WAFTING MIST, BEATING HEART and IMHOTEP'S READINGS are reaching a crescendo. Anck-su-namun's EYES suddenly FLY OPEN.
</DIRECTION>
<IMHOTEP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anck-su-namun soul had come back from the dead! Now all that was needed, was to return her organs to their rightful place within her body.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IMHOTEP>
<DIRECTION>
Imhotep lifts a sacrificial knife above Anck-su-namun's breast, about to plunge it down. The CHANTING, SWIRLING and BEATING heart CLIMAX. And that's when the Mumia BURST IN and storm through the startled Priests. The HEAD MUMIA SMASHES the jar with the beating heart. The MIST instantly sucks back out of Anck-su-namun's body and IMPLODES back into the swirling hole. Anck-su-namun's eyes close. Dying once again. Imhotep SCREAMS in rage. The Mumia grab him and his Priests.

INT. EMBALMF.RIS CHAMBER (necropolis re-vamp) - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside a TORCH-LIT CHAMBER, Imhotep is held by Anubis-headed EMBALMERS. He cringes at the flickering, impressionistic glimpses of his Priests being embalmed and mummified alive. The horrid-looking Embalmers, using knives, needles and thread, calmly perform their ghastly surgery on the SCREAMING Priests, who are going insane from the procedure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A red hot POKER is pulled out of a pit of burning coals.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Priest's head is wedged between two strong boards. His eyes widen in terror as an Embalmer moves to insert the red hot poker up his nose. But just before he does, WE QUICKLY CUT TO IMHOTEP'S FACE, horrified, as OFF CAMERA, the Priest SCREAMS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE GO WIDE on the chamber. All twenty-one of Imhotep's Priests squirm inside their wrappings. Imhotep is forced to his knees. His arms are held back. His mouth is pried open.
</DIRECTION>
<IMHOTEP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As for me, I was condemned to endure the HOM-DAI. The worst of all ancient curses. one so horrible, it had never before been bestowed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IMHOTEP>
<DIRECTION>
Using a pair of tongs, an Embalmer slowly pulls Imhotep's TONGUE out of his mouth, then places a very sharp knife on top of it. WE-GO TIGHT on IMHOTEP'S EYES as his tongue is apparently cut out. The Embalmer flings Imhotep's tongue onto the floor. The Mumia's dogs attack and quickly eat it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Imhotep is WRAPPED AL M . Only his mouth, nostrils and fear-filled eyes are left free of the slimy bandages. Detritus muck boils inside a black cauldron. Embalmers scoop out the fetid muck and apply it to Imhotep's wrappings as he squirms. He's then laid in a wooden COFFIN inside a stone SARCOPHAGUS. An Embalmer with a BUCKET steps up and looks into the coffin. Imhotep's wild eyes stare back. The Embalmer empties the bucket over Imhotep's chest: dozens of SCARABS, disgusting dung beetles. They scurry across Imhotep's SCREAMING face. Some vanish into his tongue-less mouth and up his nostrils.
</DIRECTION>
<INHOTEP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By eating the sacred scarabs, I would be cursed to stay alive forever. And by eating me, they were cursed just the same.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INHOTEP>
<DIRECTION>
The lid to the coffin is SLAMMED SHUT. Then, using a strange four-sided YCEY, the Head Mumia locks the coffin lid tight. The heavy sarcophagus lid is shoved into place and with a loud WHOOSH seals itself airtight. once again, the Head Mumia uses the strange key, locking the sarcophagus lid tight.
</DIRECTION>
<IMHOTEP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was to remain sealed inside my sarcophagus, the undead for all of eternity.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IMHOTEP>
<DIRECTION>
The blue-skinned, strangely tattooed man carefully collapses the sides of the key, --turning it into a little puzzle BOX.
</DIRECTION>
<INHOTEP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They would never allow me to be released. For I would arise a walking disease, a plague upon mankind, an unholy flesh-eater, with the strength of ages, power over the sands, and the glory of invincibility.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INHOTEP>
<DIRECTION>
Imhotep's sarcophagus is dropped into a DETRITUS PIT. The disgusting muck SPLASHES up, drools down it-s sides, and then is mysteriously sucked into It's seams, vanishing clean.
</DIRECTION>
<INHOTEP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And if I could raise my beloved Anck-su-namun from her place in hell, together, we would be an unstoppable infection upon this world. The Apocalypse. The End
	</DIALOGUE>
</INHOTEP>
<DIRECTION>
Imhotep's horrifying tongue-less SCREANS can be heard coming from inside his sarcophagus as grave diggers shovel dirt onto it. THE MAIN TITLE IS SUPERIMPOSED ON THE SCREAM: THE MUMMY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The heavily armed Mumia stand guard around Imhotep's grave. Looking down on the burial site is the huge statue of ANUBIS, the jackal-headed god of death. it stares at us. Then begins to DECAY before bur very eyes, aging 4.159 years in only seconds. And then we find ourselves and the decrepit, half-buried statue of Anubis out in the middle of the desert.

The remaining standing Legionnaires FIRE. Tuaregs spin off their mounts. Crash to the sand. And then the entire Tuareg force plows into the ruins and through the Legionnaires. O'Connell grabs the barrel of his rifle and starts CLUBBING riders off their steeds, fighting like a man possessed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beni on the other hand, is bellycrawling across the sand, whimpering in full retreat as Legionnaires fall dead all around him. He crawls through the front gate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
O'Connell throws his rifle down and goes for his guns. He cross-draws, gun in each hand, starts blowing riders off their mounts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beni crawls faster, and then he spots an open TEMPLE DOORWAY amongst the rocks. He gets up and sprints for the door as the last of the Legionnaires are shot off their feet behind him. O'Connell's guns go empty.
</DIRECTION>
<O_CONNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Son-of-a-bitch.

<O_CONNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm gonna get you for this!
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_CONNELL>
<DIRECTION>
He turns and bolts off around the rocks. Running for his life, weaving through the ruins. The Arabians getting closer and closer. The POUNDING hoofs getting LOUDER and LOUDER. O'Connell finally spins around and faces his attackers. The four massive horses crash to a stop in front of him. The vicious Tuaregs raise their rifles to finish him off. O'Connell just stands there, exhausted and beaten, then he slowly lifts his right hand and gives them the bird.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And that's when the horses go ape-shit. All four of them REAR UP. Two of the Riders are THROWN to the ground. The horses SCREECH and BELLOW and SNORT in fear, then buck like fury and haul-ass away as if the devil himself had scared them. The thrown Riders get up and race off after their mounts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
O'Connell just stands there, stunned, then he lifts his right hand and checks out his middle finger. And then he feels the evil himself, and turns around. --The shattered, decrepit statue of Anubis stares back at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the sand begins to shift under O'Connell's feet. He starts to back away, keeping his eyes on the transforming sand, it looks like huge snakes are wiggling and writhing beneath it, forming lines and shapes, --drawing a picture. O'Connell quickly turns and runs off through the ruins. The sand stops moving, and we can now see that, drawn in the sand, is a picture of IMHOTEP'S SCREAMING FACE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RIDGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Up on a ridge, A GROUP OF RIDERS watch O'Connell stumble clear of the decrepit city. O'Connell feels their presence and looks up. Very different from the Tuaregs, they have BLUE TINTED SKIN and faces covered in strange PUZZLE-TATTOOS. The Mumia. Still watching Imhotep's grave after all this time.
</DIRECTION>

INT. CAIRO MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITIES - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Deep in the bowels of the museum lie the STACKS. Rows upon rows of towering bookshelves. Filled with literature on the Antiquities. Standing at the top of a tall ladder between two of these rows and leaning against one of the bookshelves, is a rather uninteresting British GIRL: eye-glasses, hair-in-a-bun, long boring dress, your typical prudish nightmare. This is EVELYN CARNARVON. We're going to fall in love with her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn pulls a book out from a stack under her arm, blows the dust off it, then places it on a shelf with other books whose titles all begin with the letter "O". Then she grabs another book out from under her arm and reads the title.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tuthmosis? .... Now how did you get up here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
Carefully, so as not to lose her balance, she looks over her shoulder to the bookshelf behind her, where all the titles begin with the letter 'TO. Then she looks down. It's a long way to the bottom. Evelyn gently sets the other books down on the top shelf, then turns and gingerly starts to reach across the aisle with the Tuthmosis book. It's a little too far, so she stretches, reaching, holding the top of the ladder with her fingertips, she's almost got it, closer now closer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And that's when the ladder pulls away from the shelf. Evelyn YELPS, flings the Tuthmosis book and grabs the top of the ladder, which stands straight up. Evelyn holds her breath, swaying precariously, a long BEAT, and then she loses her balance, the ladder swings around and Evelyn starts stiltwalking down the aisle.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OHEIUGM! ! AHHHHHH!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
The ladder crosses the aisle, does an about face and heads back the way it came. Evelyn clings to the top, struggling for balance. The ladder teeters out into the main aisle and picks up speed. Evelyn SCREAMS as it does a 180, spins into another aisle and finally crashes to a stop at the top of a bookshelf. Evelyn holds her breath, then SIGHS HEAVILY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And that's when the bookshelf falls away from her and CRASHES into the next bookshelf. Evelyn slides down the ladder and plops to the floor. She looks up just as the domino effect kicks-in: each bookshelf crashing into the next. And onward it goes. Bookshelf after bookshelf. Thousands of volumes flinging off shelves and scattering across the floor. It finally ends as the last shelf CRASHES into a wall. Evelyn's eyes are closed. She opens one eye. Looks left. Then right. Then opens the other eye and stares at the huge mess.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oops.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
The Egyptian CURATOR storms in.
</DIRECTION>
<CURATOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at this! Sons of the Messiah! Give me frogs, flies, locusts, Anything but this! Compared to you, the other plagues were a joy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CURATOR>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn quickly gets up and starts gathering books.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, it was an accident.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<CURATOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When Ramesses destroyed Syria, it was an accident. You are a catastrophe! Why do I put up with you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CURATOR>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn turns to him, trying to contain herself.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You put up with me, because I can read and write ancient Egyptian, decipher hieroglyphs and hieratic, and I'm the only person within a thousand miles who knows how to properly code and catalogue this library.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<CURATOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who needs smart women? I put up with you because your mother and father were our finest patrons, Allah rest their souls. Now straighten up this mess!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CURATOR>
<DIRECTION>
The Curator storms out. Evelyn just stands there, steaming. And then she hears a NOISE and quickly turns around. A BEAT.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
Quiet. Eerie. And then she hears it again, like feet, slowly shuffling across the floor, coming from a nearby gallery.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Abdul? Mohammed? Bob?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn walks through the stacks and enters--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE RAMESSEUM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Filled with treasures and plunder from the Middle Kingdom. it's very dark and quiet in here, the only LIGHT is from FLICKERING TORCHES at either end of the spooky gallery.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The NOISE again! From the far side of the room. Feet, slowly shuffling, plodding across the floor. Evelyn grabs a torch. Looks around,-at a statue of Anubis, another of Horus, they stare down at Evelyn, who is starting to get scared now. She walks down the aisle. Past a closed sarcophagus. Past cases of ancient artifacts. Past another sarcophagus, --only this one is OPEN! Evelyn freezes, swallows hard, nervously looks around to see who could have opened it. Then she slowly leans forward with the torch, and peers inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--A hideous rotted MUMMY sits up and SCREECHES at her! Evelyn SCREAMS, drops the torch and backs away, scared out of her wits. And then, coming from inside the sarcophagus, she hears a Man LAUGHING. Her eyes narrow as a foppish cad crawls out from behind the Mummy, laughing his ass off, half drunk.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You... ! YOU... !

	Drunkard? Fool? Rat-bastard? Please call me something original.

</JONATHAN>
<DIRECTION>
Meet JONATHAN CARNARVON. As he crawls out of the sarcophagus, Evelyn pulls a cigarette out of the mummy's mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you no respect for the dead?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<JONATHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right now, I only wish to join them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONATHAN>
<DIRECTION>
He grins drunkenly. Evelyn punches him hard in the chest.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well I wish you'd do it sooner rather than later, before you ruin my career the way you've ruined yours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<JONATHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My dear, sweet, baby sister, I'll have you know, that at this moment my career is on a high note.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONATHAN>
<DIRECTION>
He BELCHES, then falls back and sits on the edge of a tomb.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	High note? Ha! For five years you've been scrounging around Egypt, and what have you to show for it? Nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
Jonathan excitedly starts scrounging around in his jacket.
</DIRECTION>
<JONATHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	oh yes I do! I have something right here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONATHAN>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh no, not another worthless trinket, Jonathan, if I bring one more piece of junk to the Curator to try and sell for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
Jonathan pulls out a small, ancient BOX; the collapsed KEY to Imhotep's sarcophagus and coffin. Evelyn is instantly curious, she grabs the box out of his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where did you get this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
Jonathan knows her weaknesses, gives her a mischievous smile.
</DIRECTION>
<JONATHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	On a dig, down in Thebes
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONATHAN>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn rolls the box around in her hands, mumbling to herself as she translates the hieratics and hieroglyphs covering it. Jonathan licks his lips in anticipation.
</DIRECTION>
<JONATHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My whole life I've never found anything, Evy Tell me I've found something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONATHAN>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn's fingers play with the various little slats on the box, shifting them this way and that way, it's like a puzzle box. Then suddenly, it UNFOLDS ITSELF, almost-mechanically, turning itself into the KEY. Sitting inside the open key/box is a folded piece of GOLDEN PAPYRUS. An ANCIENT MAP.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jonathan?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<JONATHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONATHAN>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you found something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CURATOR'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Curator sits at his desk, staring through a jeweler's eyepiece at the key/box. Evelyn hovers behind him, excited.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See the cartouche there, it's the official royal seal of Seti the First, I'm sure of it
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<CURATOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps
	</DIALOGUE>
</CURATOR>
<DIRECTION>
Jonathan leans in from across the desk.
</DIRECTION>
<JONATHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two questions. Who the hell is Seti the First? And was he rich?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONATHAN>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was the last Pharaoh of the Old Kingdom, said to be the wealthiest Pharaoh of them all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<JONATHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright, good, that's good. I like this fellow, like him very much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONATHAN>
<DIRECTION>
The Curator picks up the MAP. It's actually the exact same map that we established in the opening scenes of the movie.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've already dated it, this map is almost four thousand years old. And the hieratics over here....
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Inhales deeply)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's Hamunaptra.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
The Curator freezes, suddenly very nervous, then he recovers
</DIRECTION>
<CURATOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My dear girl, don't be ridiculous, we are scholars, not treasure hunters. Hamunaptra is a myth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CURATOR>
<JONATHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are we talking about the Hamunaptra?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONATHAN>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. The City of The Dead. Where the early Pharaohs were said to have hidden the wealth of Egypt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<JONATHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right, right, in a big underground treasure chamber. Everybody knows the story. The entire necropolis was rigged to sink into the sand. On Pharaoh's command, a flick of the switch! And the whole place could disappear beneath the dunes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONATHAN>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All we know is that the city mysteriously vanished around 2,134 B.C.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
The Curator holds the map closer to the burning CANDLE-LAMP.
</DIRECTION>
<CURATOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As the Americans would say: it's all fairy tales and hokum.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CURATOR>
<DIRECTION>
The map 'accidentally,' CATCHES ON FIRE. The Curator throws it to the floor. Jonathan drops to his knees and quickly puts it out. Lifts it up. The left third of the map is now missing.
</DIRECTION>
<JONATHM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You burned it! You burned off the part with the lost city!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONATHM>
<CURATOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's for the best, I'm sure. Many men have wasted their lives in the foolish pursuit of Hamunaptra, no one has ever found it, most have never returned.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CURATOR>
<JONATHAN>
<DIRECTION>
(devastated)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You killed my map.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONATHAN>
<CURATOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sure it was a fake, anyway, I'm surprised at you, Miss Carnarvon, to be so fooled.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CURATOR>
<DIRECTION>
The Curator reaches for the key/box. Evelyn quickly snatches it off the desk and gives him a very angry, suspicious look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CAIRO PRISON - GALLOWS COURTYARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cairo prison. One of the worst hell holes on earth. Every low-life form of scumbag can be found here. The WARDEN, a first rate scumbag himself, escorts Evelyn and Jonathan across the gallows courtyard. Evelyn whispers to Jonathan.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You told me you found it on a dig down in Thebes!

<JONATHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That just makes you more gullible.

</JONATHAN>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You stole it from a drunk at the local Casbah?!

EXT. VISITORIS PEN - DAY

<DIRECTION>
The Warden ushers Evelyn and Jonathan into the holding pen.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	and what is he in prison for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<WARDEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I did not know, so when I heard you were coming, I asked him that myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WARDEN>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what did he say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<WARDEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He said,....he was just looking for a good time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WARDEN>
<DIRECTION>
The interior cell door BURSTS OPEN. O'Connell is in chains, dragged by FOUR GUARDS, they shove him up to the cell bars. From the looks of it, he's been here awhile; his face is half hidden by long hair, a scraggly beard and many new bruises. Evelyn looks at him, disgusted by his appearance.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But he's just a filthy criminal?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<JONATHAN>
<DIRECTION>
(cringing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Way to go, Evy.

O'Connell gives Evelyn the once over, then looks at Jonathan.
</DIRECTION>
<O_CONNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So who's the broad?
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_CONNELL>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Broad?!

</EVELYN>
<JONATHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's my sister, actually.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONATHAN>
<O_CONNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah? Well, ....I'm sure she's not a total loss.
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_CONNELL>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn is stunned and furious. The Warden heads out the door.
</DIRECTION>
<WARDEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be back in a moment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WARDEN>
<O_CONNELL>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I tremble with anticipation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_CONNELL>
<DIRECTION>
A Guard CLUBS O'Connell across the head, O'Connell's face bounces off the metal bars. He shows no pain, but just looks back and gives the Guard a nasty look. Evelyn steps closer.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We uh,...found .... your puzzle box, and we've come to ask you about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<O_CONNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.

<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No?

</EVELYN>
<O_CONNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. ...You came to ask me about Hamunaptra.
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_CONNELL>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn and Jonathan quickly look around, hoping the guards didn't hear him. They step closer. Evelyn plays coy.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you know the box pertains to Hamunaptra?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<O_CONNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because that's where I found it. I was there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_CONNELL>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn is dumbstruck. But Jonathan looks suspicious
</DIRECTION>
<JONATHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do we know that's not a load of pig swallow?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONATHAN>
<DIRECTION>
O'Connell looks closer at Jonathan, a glint of recognition.
</DIRECTION>
<O_CONNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey,....don't I know you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_CONNELL>
<JONATHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Um, well, you see....
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONATHAN>
<DIRECTION>
O'Connell's FIST comes flying through the bars, hits Jonathan square in the jaw, DECKS HIM. He hits the floor. Out cold. A Guard CLUBS O'Connell. His head bounces off the bars again. He shows no pain, but gives the Guard another nasty look. Evelyn looks down at her brother, then back at O'Connell.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were actually at Hamunaptra?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<O_CONNELL>

The warden enters. Evelyn quickly leans closer to O'Connell.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could you tell me how to get there? The exact location?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<O_CONNELL>

<O_CONNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>

She leans her face right up to the bars, nervous and excited
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.

O'Connell steps forward and KISSES her full on the lips.
</DIRECTION>
<O_CONNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then get me the hell outta here
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_CONNELL>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn is stunned. A Guard CLUBS him, his face bounces off the bars again, but before he can react the Guards GRAB him, YANK him away from the bars and DRAG him out of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are they taking him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<WARDEN>

	To be hanged.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. GALLOWS COURTYARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hundreds of filthy PRISONERS stare down onto the gallows as the hangman's noose is draped over O'Connell's head and cinched tight around his neck. Evelyn follows the warden onto a balcony above the gallows. The prisoners all go dead quiet at the sight of her; like jackals staring at fresh meat.
</DIRECTION>
<WARDEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No women allowed.

</WARDEN>
<EVELYN>

This seems to confuse the Warden, he shrugs and sits down.

<DIRECTION>
O'Connell looks up as Evelyn plops down beside the Warden
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will give you one hundred pounds to spare his life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<WARDEN>

O'Connell can hear every word, he looks hopeful. Other than Evelyn, you could hear a pin drop. The HANGMAN turns to him
</DIRECTION>
<HANGMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Any last requests, pig?

</HANGMAN>
<O_CONNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I'd like ya to let me go

The Hangman grabs the lever to the trapdoor.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
The Warden sets his greasy, lecherous hand on Evelyn's leg.
</DIRECTION>
<WARDEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what else?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WARDEN>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn is revolted, she quickly shoves his hand away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-Insulted, the Warden angrily turns and gestures to the Hangman, who pulls the lever. The trapdoor DROPS AWAY.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	NOOO!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
O'Connell DROPS through the hole. The rope pays-out. Then JERKS TAUGHT. O'Connell's body SNAPS at the end of the rope. But he's still alive, because--
</DIRECTION>
<WARDEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His neck did not break! Good!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WARDEN>
<DIRECTION>
Now we watch him strangle to death.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The prisoners go ape-shit, SCREAMING and SHOUTING in anger. The GUARDS look around, nervous. O'Connell struggles at the end of the rope, gagging. Evelyn is horrified, she quickly turns to the warden, leans forward and whispers in his ear.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He knows the location to Hamunaptra.

</WARDEN>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would never!

<DIRECTION>
At the end of the rope, O'Connell is choking and gagging and turning several shades of red. The Warden stares at Evelyn.
</DIRECTION>
<WARDEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you saying this filthy godless son of a pig knows where to find The City Of The Dead? Truly?

Evelyn hesitates, bites her lip. O'Connell's eyes bulge as he looks up at her, he can't believe this girl.

The warden flashes a big green smile, then YELLS in Arabic
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A scimitar SLASHES the air. The rope is CUT. O'Connell CRASHES to the ground. Half dead. Rolls over. GAGGING.

<DIRECTION>
All of the prisoners BURST INTO CHEERS. O'Connell looks up at Evelyn. She smiles broadly and waves down at him.

WE CRANE BACK: to reveal Beni standing on the bow of a PASSENGER BARGE. Surrounded by DANIELS, HENDERSON and BURNS,
</DIRECTION>
<DANIELS>

WE KEEP CRANING BACK: as Henderson slaps Daniels on the back.
</DIRECTION>
<HENDERSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Hamunaptra," Daniels, that's all ya gotta keep sayin, to yourself, "Hamunaptra."
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENDERSON>
<DIRECTION>
Now we see all of GIZA PORT: Team of explorers swarm the docks. Across the Nile, the PYRAMIDS spike the sky. Evelyn and Jonathan walk along the boardwalk besieged by HAWKERS selling everything from toy tombs to King Tut action figures.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you really think he'll show up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<JONATHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Undoubtedly, I know the breed, he may be a cowboy, but his word is his word.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONATHAN>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Personally, I think he's filthy, rude and a complete scoundrel. I don't like him one bit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<O_CONNELL>
<DIRECTION>
(o.s.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyone I know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_CONNELL>
<DIRECTION>
They both turn. O'Connell walks up; shaved, showered, spit and polished, with a new haircut and clothes. He looks more dashing and handsome than ever. Evelyn is suitably impressed.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh .... um,...hello.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
Jonathan grabs O'Connell's arm and shakes his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<JONATHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Smashing day for the start of an adventure, eh, O'Connell?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONATHAN>
<DIRECTION>
O'Connell quickly checks his pockets.
</DIRECTION>
<O_CONNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, sure, smashing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_CONNELL>
<DIRECTION>
He finds his wallet and relaxes. DIRECTLY ABOVE HIM: on the bow of the barge, Burns wipes his bifocals and turns to Beni.
</DIRECTION>
<BURNS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're sure Hamunaptra is out there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURNS>
<BENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Along with the scorched bones of my entire garrison, sahib.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENI>
<DIRECTION>
And that's when Beni spots O'Connell. Beni shakes his head, as if seeing a mirage, then starts backing away from the men.
</DIRECTION>
<BENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A thousand pardons, my good sahibs but there is much work to be done.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENI>
<DIRECTION>
Beni quickly scurries off, vanishing down into the hold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK DOWN WITH: Evelyn, recovering, she clears her throat.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mister O'Connell, can you look me in the eye, and guarantee me this is not some sort of flimflam? Because if it is, I'm warning you--
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
--O'Connell steps up close to Evelyn, invading her space looks her straight in the eye. Evelyn doesn't back away.
</DIRECTION>
<O_CONNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All I can tell you, miss, is that my Colonel found that map in an ancient fortress, and the whole damn garrison believed in it so much, that without orders, we marched halfway across Libya and into Egypt to find that city. Like I told ya, all I saw was sand. Everybody else was wiped-out by Tuareg warriors. I'll take your bags.
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_CONNELL>
<DIRECTION>
O'Connell takes her bags and heads up the gangplank and onto
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SAME PASSENGER BARGE THAT BENI AND THE AMERICANS ARE ON.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn's eyes follow him, a bit wistfully. Jonathan sees it.
</DIRECTION>
<JONATHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, yes, you're right, filthy, rude, a complete scoundrel, nothing to like there at all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONATHAN>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn gives him a look. Jonathan just grins. And that's when the warden suddenly brushes past, tipping his raggedy hat.
</DIRECTION>
<WARDEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A bright good morning to all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WARDEN>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>

</EVELYN>
<WARDEN>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</WARDEN>
<DIRECTION>
And up the plank he goes. Evelyn and Jonathan share a look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE GO WIDE AGAIN: as the barge pulls out and heads down the Nile. WE TILT UP: to the SUN, which then DISSOLVES into--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RIVER NILE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--The MOON, shining down on the desert. The THREE VICIOUS MUMIA quietly glide a narrow skiff out onto the river. The one with the hook sits in the middle of the skiff, the other two row, heading for the PASSENGER BARGE coming their way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE BAR AT THE BOW - NIGHT

Jonathan and the three Americans are playing poker. O'Connell comes out a door carrying a GUNNY-SACK.

<DANIELS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never? What if I were to wager five hundred dollars says we get to Hamunaptra before you?
	</DIALOGUE>

O'Connell returns Daniel's cocky look.
</DIRECTION>
<O_CONNELL>

Burns slips on his dirty bifocals.

<O_CONNELL>

Henderson spits a wad of chew into a spittoon.
</DIRECTION>
<HENDERSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We got us a man who's actually been there
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENDERSON>
<DIRECTION>
O'Connell's poker face drops, perplexed. Same with Jonathan
</DIRECTION>
<JONATHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I say, what a coincidence, why--
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONATHAN>
<DIRECTION>
--O'Connell 'accidentally' hits him in the ribs with the gunny-sack, shutting him up. Jonathan quickly covers.
</DIRECTION>
<JONATHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--whose deal is it? Is it my deal? I thought I just dealt?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONATHAN>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BARGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn sits on a table, staring out over the passing river. The gunny-sack DROPS onto the table, startling her.
</DIRECTION>
<O_CONNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, didn't mean to scare ya
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_CONNELL>
<ELVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The only thing that scares me, Mister O'Connell, are your manners,
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELVELYN>
<O_CONNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_CONNELL>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you call that a kiss.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
O'Connell reaches into the gunny-sack and starts pulling out revolvers, pistols, hunting knives, a massive elephant gun, and a half dozen carefully wrapped sticks of dynamite.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did I miss something? Are we going into battle?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<O_CONNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The last time I was at that place everybody I was with died.
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_CONNELL>
<DIRECTION>
This takes the smile off Evelyn's face. O'Connell starts dismantling and cleaning the guns.
</DIRECTION>
<O_CONNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's something out there, you know, something under that sand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_CONNELL>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I'm hoping to find a certain artifact, a book, actually, my brother thinks there's treasure. What do you think is out there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
O'Connell looks into Evelyn's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<O_CONNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Evil. The Tuaregs and the Bedouin believe that Hamunaptra is cursed, they call it, "the doorway to hell"
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_CONNELL>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ahmar is Ossirion. "Passageway to the underworld", actually.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
She gives him a know-it-all grin.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't believe in fairy tales and hokum, Mister 0'Connell, but I do believe that one of the most famous books in history is buried out there, The Book Of The Living It's what first interested me in Egypt as a child. It's why I came here, sort of a life's pursuit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<O_CONNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the fact that they say it's made out of pure gold, makes no nevermind to you, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_CONNELL>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn is surprised by his knowledge.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know your history.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<O_CONNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know my treasure.-
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_CONNELL>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn gets up to go, then she hesitates, nervous, she turns back to O'Connell, and as matter-of-fact as possible says:
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By the way, ...why did you kiss me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
O'Connell, cleaning his guns, just shrugs his shoulders
</DIRECTION>
<O_CONNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was about to be hanged, seemed like a good idea at the time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_CONNELL>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn's eyes widen, furious, she turns and storms off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
O'Connell looks up, watching her leave, a bit perplexed
</DIRECTION>
<O_CONNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? .... Wha'd I say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_CONNELL>
<DIRECTION>
Then he hears someone SNICKERING under the table. He quickly reaches down, grabs that someone and lifts him up. It's Beni.
</DIRECTION>
<BENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My very good friend! What a surprise
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENI>
<O_CONNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why if it ain't my little buddy, Beni. I outta kill you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_CONNELL>
<DIRECTION>
O'Connell sticks a knife under Beni's throat. Beni swallows hard, then tries to weasel his way out with a big grin.
</DIRECTION>
<BENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You never were any good with the ladies, O'Connell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENI>
<O_CONNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you're the one leading the Americans, I shoulda figured. So what's the scam? You get 'em
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_CONNELL>
<DIRECTION>
out in the middle of the desert
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
then leave 'em to rot?
</DIRECTION>
<BENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Unfortunately no, these Americans are smart, they pay me only half now, half when I get them back to Cairo, so I must go all the way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENI>
<DIRECTION>
O'Connell pulls the knife away. Beni relaxes, rubs his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<BENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You never believed in Hamunaptra, O'Connell. Why are you going back? The devil himself lives out there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENI>
<DIRECTION>
They look as they hear Evelyn YELP. A single CAMEL in the HORSE PADDOCK takes another bite at her. She YELPS again and backs away. O'Connell grins as Evelyn flees down the deck.
</DIRECTION>
<O_CONNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The girl saved my life, figured it was the least I could do, keep her out of trouble.
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_CONNELL>
<BENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You always did have more balls than brains.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENI>
<DIRECTION>
O'Connell's eyes narrow at the insult, he looks back at Beni
</DIRECTION>
<O_CONNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's make us even, shall we?
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_CONNELL>
<BENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Even?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENI>
<DIRECTION>
O'Connell grabs him and chucks him over the side of the barge. Beni SPLASHES into the river. O'Connell takes his gunny-sack and starts walking off down the deck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BENI(o.s)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O'Connell! I am going to kill you for this!
	</DIALOGUE>
<O_CONNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sounds familiar.
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_CONNELL>
<DIRECTION>
And that's when he spots THREE SETS OF WET FOOTPRINTS, coming up over the railing from the river and heading down the deck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
O'Connell quickly looks around, immediately on the alert.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EVELYN'S CABIN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn, wearing a nightgown, stands in front of a mirror. She gives her head a good shake, letting her hair fall loose over her bare shoulders. Then she turns around, RIGHT THERE IS ONE OF THE HIDEOUS MUMIA! It's Hook. He slams his hand over her mouth and lifts up his hook, ready to strike.
</DIRECTION>
<HOOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is the map?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOOK>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn's terrified eyes glance down. Hook looks over, sees the map lying next to a flickering candle on a nearby table,
</DIRECTION>
<HOOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the key? Where is the key?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOOK>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn's eyes look confused. She shakes her head. Hook grins,
</DIRECTION>
<HOOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then I'll find it myself,
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOOK>
<DIRECTION>
He cocks his hook, about to kill her. And that's when the door is KICKED OPEN. O'Connell BURSTS IN, gun in each hand. Hook spins Evelyn around and holds her out in front of him. O'Connell looks at her.
</DIRECTION>
<O_CONNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Friend of yours?
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_CONNELL>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn's eyes widen. And that's when the candle on the table FLICKERS. Everything happens at once, READ FAST: O'Connell spins around just as a window BURSTS OPEN. A Mumia leans in. FIRES A GUN. Woodchips BLAST OFF the wall next to O'Connell's head. He returns FIRE. Kills the Mumia. The Mumia falls back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FIRING BLINDLY.-A LANTERN in the room is BLASTED. Kerosene SPLASHES across the wall. BURSTS INTO FLAMES. Evelyn grabs the candle on the table and JAMS IT back over her shoulder, right into Hook's EYE. He SCREECHES in pain and lets her go. O'Connell grabs her and YANKS her out of the FLAMING ROOM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

	</DIALOGUE>
</O_CONNELL>
<DIRECTION>
EVELYN'S FLAMING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hot melted wax covers Hook's face as he holds his sore eye and struggles to the door. Then he notices the key/box on the floor. He bends over to pick it up. And that's when the door is KICKED OPEN again, it hits him in the ass and knocks him into the fire. Jonathan leans in. Sees nothing but flames.
</DIRECTION>
<JONATHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another LANTERN BURSTS INTO FLAMES. O'Connell SHOOTS OFF the paddock lock. The horses go nuts. O'Connell FIRES over their heads. They CHARGE FORWARD and CRASH through the door. The Mumia SCREAMS as the horses STAMPEDE over him. FLAMES sweep up the walls and race across the roof. Half the barge is now ON FIRE. O'Connell throws the gunny-sack over his shoulder.

And then suddenly, the volcano SHIFTS ACROSS THE HORIZON. Passing across the sun as it goes. --It's a MIRAGE. The Americans crash their horses to a stop and race the other way, after the volcano. Evelyn and Jonathan smile, amazed. The volcano SHIFTS AGAIN, floating across the watery horizon. The Americans crash to a stop again and chase after the volcano. All three of them confused and CURSING. O'Connell and Beni just stare, waiting. The volcano SHIFTS AGAIN. And the Americans crash to a stop again. Burns is THROWN from his horse. Henderson angrily rips his hat off and chucks it to the ground. Daniels just curses as they give up the chase.

The volcano comes to a stop on the far left of the horizon. The Americans are on the far right. Nothing moves. A BEAT. And then O'Connell grins. So does Beni. They share a look. And then SWAT their camels and RACE AWAY. Everybody else hauls-ass after them. O'Connell and Beni are neck-and-neck. And then Evelyn comes galloping up, hair flying in the wind. Beni takes out his camel whip and starts WHIPPING O'Connell. Trying to knock him off his camel. once. CRACK! Twice. CRACK! But on the third try O'Connell grabs the whip and JERKS Beni off his camel. Beni SLAMS to the ground and TUMBLES. Evelyn and O'Connell race across the desert. Evelyn has never felt so alive. She LAUGHS. O'Connell grins; he likes this girl.

O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan crouch as they make their way through a narrow, COBWEB INFESTED LABYRINTH. The short, squat warden can stand straight up. Then they hear something and freeze. It sounds like somebody is clawing inside the walls. They share looks. Then slowly move forward. Getting darker and darker as they go. The strange sound getting louder and louder. And then it stops.

CLOSE ON: the scarab on the floor. It begins to TRANSFORM. The amethyst starts to glow. Something inside starts to WIGGLE; as if the amethyst were some sort of strange cocoon. Then it splits open and a real live hideous SCARAB--BEETLE scurries out. It races over to the warden's shoe, quickly burrows into the leather and vanishes inside.

The Warden's eyes FLY OPEN. He starts to SCREAM, drops his knife and frantically starts clawing away at his pant leg, higher and higher until he rips open his shirt revealing a

large, hideous LUMP, BURROWING UNDER HIS SKIN. IT BURROWS IT'S WAY UP HIS FAT BELLY AND ACROSS HIS HAIRY CHEST. The Warden claws and scratches at it, trying to stop it. The lump BURROWS UP HIS NECK. The Warden starts GAGGING and COUGHING. And then the scarab-lump VANISHES INTO HIS HEAD.

EXT. AMERICAN CAMP - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The American camp is under siege. Two dozen MUMIA RIDERS gallop through. FIRING RIFLES. Several Diggers are killed as they run. The Americans leap out of their tents FIRING. Kill multiple Riders. Daniels is shot, spins and falls, keeps SHOOTING. Henderson and Burns run to his aid, BLASTING AWAY. O'Connell races through the ruins and SLAMS right into Beni, who is obviously trying to high-tail-it out of there.
</DIRECTION>
<O_CONNELL>

<BENI>
	<DIALOGUE>

O'Connell drags him back towards the American camp.

<O_CONNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>

	'Cause I look good doin, it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_CONNELL>
<DIRECTION>
Ardeth Bay gallops through the camp, cutting Diggers down with his scimitar. O'Connell runs up on top of some rocks, LEAPS OUT and TACKLES him off his horse. The two men SLAM to the ground. O'Connell spins up onto one knee and FIRES, point blank. Blows the scimitar out of Ardeth Bay's hand. O'Connell is about to shoot again when a horse rides up between them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A scimitar swoops down, almost takes O'Connell's head off, misses him by an inch. O'Connell leaps up and blows the Rider off his mount. The horse BOLTS. --But Ardeth Bay is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn hides behind some rocks, watching the scene, suddenly, she hears something coming up behind her and spins around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A vicious tattooed Mumia Rider races at her. Evelyn quickly backpedals over the rocks, terrified. The Mumia Rider raises his scimitar, about to strike. Evelyn SCREAMS, trips over a rock and FIRES the elephant gun, --BLAM! Blows the Rider off his mount and CATAPULTS him twenty feet back into some ruins.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the same time, the kick blows Evelyn off her feet and over a ridge. She FLAILS through the air and lands in a sand dune.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jonathan and some - Diggers are holding their own near the temple door. Four Riders come CHARGING right at them. Jonathan takes a swig off the Seagrams.
</DIRECTION>
<JONATHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let 'em have it, boys!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONATHAN>
<DIRECTION>
Jonathan and the Diggers OPEN FIRE. When the smoke clears, the Riders are either dead or gone. Jonathan grins.
</DIRECTION>
<JONATHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I say, bloody good show.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONATHAN>
<DIRECTION>
And then several more Mumia leap off the temple and land behind them. Jonathan and the remaining Diggers spin around and suddenly find themselves in hand-to-hand combat. O'Connell is quickly loading his pistol. He hears something THUNDERING UP behind him. He spins around just as Ardeth Bay on a horse swings his scimitar. O'Connell instinctively raises his hands to protect his face, the scimitar STRIKES! Hits his gun, --CHING! O'Connell's gun flips away. Disarmed, O'Connell dives and rolls and suddenly comes up with a stick of dynamite in his hand. He shoves the fuse into a fire. It IGNITES. He faces Ardeth Bay, towering above him. The two men lock eyes. The fuse continues to burn down. Ardeth Bay points his scimitar at O'Connell's head.
</DIRECTION>
<ARDETH_BAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	LEAVE THIS PLACE! .... LEAVE THIS PLACE OR DIE!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARDETH_BAY>
<DIRECTION>
Ardeth Bay GALLOPS OFF. The remaining Mumia Riders race after him, vanishing into the night. O'Connell watches them leave, then turns to the burning fuse, ....and blows it out. Evelyn staggers up, looking very shaken. O'Connell gently takes her and holds her close.
</DIRECTION>
<O_CONNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You alright?
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_CONNELL>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn looks up into his strong eyes. It's the first time he's shown genuine concern for her. And she likes it. He's also holding her a little too close. And she likes that too.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, ...fine, ...thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
Beni crawls out from under some pillars as Henderson and Burns help Daniels to his feet.

O'Connell looks up into the surrounding ridges, unsatisfied.
</DIRECTION>
<O_CONNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These men are a desert people they value water, not gold.

Evelyn looks at O'Connell, suddenly very worried.

</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BASE CAMP - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jonathan falls into FRAME. Hits the ground. Eyes wide open. Mouth agape. Clearly dead. A BEAT. And then his eyes close and his mouth widens into a goofy smile. Shit-faced drunk. O'Connell and Evelyn laugh, both half-in-the-bag themselves, the bottle of Seagrams is almost gone. O'Connell offers the bottle to Evelyn, she waves it away, slurring badly--
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Unlike my brother, sir, I know when to say no.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
O'Connell polishes off the bottle and chucks it away.
</DIRECTION>
<O_CONNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Unlike your brother, Miss, you I don't get. You're a whole new brew.
	</DIALOGUE>

	Okay, I get your father, I get your mother and I get your brother, but what are you doing here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_CONNELL>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn is insulted, she staggers to her feet.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I may not be an explorer, or an adventurer, or a treasure hunter, or a gunfighter! Mister O'Connell But I'm proud of what I am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<O_CONNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what is that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_CONNELL>

Evelyn plops back down beside him, really drunk, she grins and proudly lifts her head high.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	..... am a librarian!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
She leans in, very close to his face, looks him in the eyes,
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>

</EVELYN>
<O_CONNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because that's my name.
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_CONNELL>
<DIRECTION>
She gives him a goofy smile. He leans forward and KISSES HER. Evelyn's eyes slowly close. And then she passes out, slumping into his arms. O'Connell looks down at her, and just smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. IMHOTEPIS CHAMBER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn's HAND slips the KEY into the sarcophagus, lock and turns it. A series of STRANGE MECHANICAL-LIKE SOUNDS are heard, and then the sarcophagus unlocks with a GIANT HISS. O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan all look very, very hungover.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They start to slide the heavy lid off the sarcophagus. PUSHING, SHOVING and GROANING, the lid budging, inch by inch.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	.I can't believe I allowed the two of you to get me drunk.
	</DIALOGUE>

Evelyn gives O'Connell a nervous look.

</EVELYN>
<O_CONNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gee, yeah, you told me it was the best time you ever had.
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_CONNELL>
<DIRECTION>
O'Connell gives her a big cheesy smile. Evelyn's face drops, appalled and embarrassed. And that's when the lid FALLS OFF and LOUDLY CRASHES to the ground. All three of them instantly grab their sore heads and MOAN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Several fear-filled, sweaty-faced Diggers reach into the secret compartment. Henderson and Burns hold guns on them. Daniels has his arm in a sling. The Diggers slowly pull out the ORNATE CHEST. They set the chest down on the sandy floor. Beni watches as the Egyptologist translates the hieratics.
</DIRECTION>
<EGYPTOLOGIST>

<HENDERSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, yeah, okay, what's it
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENDERSON>
<DIRECTION>
The Egyptologist slowly and carefully reads the inscription:
</DIRECTION>
<EGYPTOLOGIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Death will come on swift wings to whomever opens this chest".
	</DIALOGUE>
</EGYPTOLOGIST>
<DIRECTION>
A GUST OF WIND blows through the chamber. TORCHES FLICKER All-the Diggers suddenly turn tail and run off SCREAMING. The Americans look at each other, suddenly very nervous.
</DIRECTION>
<EGYPTOLOGIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It says, there is one, the undead, who if brought back to life, is bound by sacred law to consummate this curse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EGYPTOLOGIST>
<HENDERSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, well, let's just make sure we don't bring anybody back from the dead then, huh? The three Americans laugh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENDERSON>
<EGYPTOLOGIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He will kill all who open this chest, ...and assimilate their organs and fluids.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EGYPTOLOGIST>
<DANIELS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Assimilate their organs and fluids? Ya mean eat 'em?

	<DIALOGUE>
	And in so doing he will regenerate. And no longer be the undead, but a plague upon this earth.

</EGYPTOLOGIST>
<DIRECTION>
The WIND WHISTLES. Torches FLICKER. VERY SPOOKY. Beni and the Egyptologist share a fear-filled look. Henderson just shrugs.

	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<O_CONNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You dream about dead guys?
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_CONNELL>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn just gives him a look, then starts brushing dirt and cobwebs off the top of the coffin. Then she freezes.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, all the sacred spells have been chiseled off. The hieratics and hieroglyphs that protect the deceased on his journey into the afterlife, they've been removed. This man was cursed, ....doomed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
O'Connell and Jonathan are too excited to care

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I'm all tears, now let's see who's inside, shall we?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONATHAN>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn can't believe these guys. Jonathan inserts the key/box into the coffin's lock. Turns it. The lid cracks open with a HISS. They all react to the FOUL STENCH. Then O'Connell grabs the lid. It's stuck. He pulls with all his might. Jonathan helps him. It starts to give way. Slowly. Slowly. Slooooowly. And then it suddenly POPS OPEN and THE MOST HIDEOUS, MAGGOT- INFESTED, ROTTEN CORPSE IMAGINABLE JUMPS UP!
</DIRECTION>
<O_CONNELL_EVELYN_JONATHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	AHHHHH!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_CONNELL_EVELYN_JONATHAN>

They all jump back. Scared to death. Imhotep is now the 'Elephant Man' of corpses; twisted and deformed. The years have not been kind. He slumps back into his coffin.

INT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER - DAY

<DIRECTION>
The vapor is settling. The Americans have their guns aimed at the chest. The Egyptologist slowly steps up, reaches inside, and lifts out a heavy burlap bag. Everyone's eyes widen in excitement as he sticks his hand into the bag and slowly pulls out the black BOOK OF THE DEAD, the same book Imhotep used in his attempt to bring Anck-su-namun back to life.
</DIRECTION>
<EGYPTOLOGIST>

EXT. CAMP - LATER THAT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Having just freshened up for bed, Evelyn exits the temple and steps past the sleeping Diggers. She spots the Egyptologist, his jeweled canopic jar snug under one arm, the Book Of The Dead laying loose under the other. Evelyn stares at the Book, nervously biting her lip, then she sneaks over, carefully steals it, and quickly tip-toes away.
</DIRECTION>

Lying on some blankets by the campfire, O'Connell rolls over and sees Evelyn, sitting wide-eyed, staring at the Book.

He skids to a stop as a strange, piercing WHINE is heard, coming from out in the desert. O'Connell and the others all leap to their feet. The Americans run out of their tents.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SOUND gets LOUDER and CLOSER. And then from out of the darkness a HUGE WALL OF LOCUSTS SWIRLS into camp and envelops everyone. O'Connell grabs Evelyn, and with Jonathan at their side they race for the crevice, trying to fend off the horrid vermin as they go. Beni and the Americans run for the temple.

O'Connell leaps out onto a pedestal. Jonathan jumps up next to him. Evelyn jumps up into a grotto on the other side of the narrow stairway. The horrible herd of vicious scarabs scurries between them, their ear-piercing CRITTERS send shivers up Evelyn's spine. She leans back. THE WALL MOVES. Evelyn falls backwards through an opening.

Evelyn sits up, shakes the sand out of her hair, fearfully looks around. It's almost PITCH BLACK. She gets up and feels her way along the dark walls. She rounds a corner.

Evelyn SCREAMS again and backs away into a wall. Her hair is down, her face is dirty and sweaty, her blouse is ripped, her dress is torn, she's never looked sexier. Imhotep SQUINTS.

But it's too late. The Digger SCREAMS in horror as the herd of scarabs run over him, eating straight through him, leaving behind the Digger's half eaten skeleton.

Burns opens his mouth, but can only GURGLE and MOAN because HIS TONGUE IS MISSING. Imhotep grabs him, throws him to the ground and sets his skeletal foot on Burns' chest, like a big game hunter standing on his kill. Imhotep then parts his fetid lips, --A FRESH TONGUE FLAPS BETWEEN HIS ROTTED TEETH.

O'Connell and Evelyn start backing away down the wall. Imhotep glides sideways with them, like a tiger cornering his prey, the sand around him SWIRLS and DANCES. Burns starts to crawl away, whimpering as he goes. Imhotep suddenly stops and UNHINGES his skeletal jaw, his skinless mouth stretches to an inhuman size, and he lets out a horrific, primordial SHRIEK.

<DIRECTION>
Beni sloway backs up around Anubis, eyes wide, gun up. He turns around, --IMHOTEP IS RIGHT THERE! Beni SCREAMS, backs away and OPENS FIRE. Six GUNSHOTS perforate Imhotep, but have no effect except to SPLATTER molten flesh rot onto the back wall. Beni retreats into a corner, scared shitless. Imhotep moves forward, his one hand trying to stop the molten mummy guts from oozing out of the large shotgun hole in his side. Beni drops his gun and grabs at the CHAINS around his neck, 'RELIGIOUS SYMBOLS AND ICONS dangle from each chain. Beni holds the first one up: A CHRISTIAN CRUCIFIX. He quickly makes the sign of-the cross and blesses himself in English:
</DIRECTION>
<BENI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	May the good Lord protect and watch over me as a shepherd watches over his flock. And may Satan in all his forms be vanquished forever.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENI>
<DIRECTION>
It has no effect on Imhotep, who continues forward. Beni quickly grabs at the other symbols and icons, holding them out towards Imhotep, one after the other, trying to slow his progress: an Islamic Sword and Crescent Moon necklace; a Hindu Brahma medallion; a small Buddhist Bodhisattva statue. All while blessing himself in Arabic, Hindi, Chinese and Latin. Nothing works. Imhotep's skeletal hand reaches for Beni's throat. Tears run down Beni's cheeks he's so freaked. And that's when he holds up THE STAR OF DAVID and blesses himself in HEBREW. Imhotep stops in his tracks. His hand lowers. His grotesque new eyeballs stare at Beni.

Imhotep keeps coming. O'Connell OPENS FIRE. BLASTING Imhotep Bullets RIP through his body. Imhotep doesn't seem to mind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jonathan, Henderson and Daniels run into the room. They're all stunned at the sight of Imhotep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
O'Connell steps forward, throws a RIGHT HOOK, punches Imhotep in the face, --HIS FIST GOES THROUGH IMHOTEPIS SKULL AND GETS STUCK DEEP INSIDE HIS HEAD. O'Connell stares at it, shocked, then quickly YANKS his fist back out. The area of Imhotep's face that came into contact with O'Connell's fist quickly DEGENERATES and DECAYS, right down to the bone, as if O'Connell's hand instantly infected it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Imhotep angrily turns, grabs O'Connell, and with no effort, THROWS him across the room and into Jonathan and the others knocking them down. Imhotep looks at his hand, the one that just grabbed O'Connell, --IT STARTS TO SHRIVEL and DECAY. He quickly turns to Evelyn. Evelyn backs away into a wall, terrorized. Imhotep steps up to her.

And that's when a WHITE CAT jumps onto the piano, HISSING. Imhotep SHRIEKS. The balcony doors BLOW OPEN. Imhotep spins into a BLAST OF WIND AND SAND and SWIRLS out the doors. Gone.

O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and Daniels stand transfixed. Henderson kneels next to Burns, shriveled body, horrified.

Down in the bazaar, people are SCREAMING and quickly backing away from the SHRIVELLED CORPSE OF THE EGYPTOLOGIST.

A partially decayed HAND reaches down and takes the sacred canopic jar out of the Egyptologist's shriveled hand. It's Imhotep, having regenerated even further. He looks up and catches eyes with O'Connell. Imhotep grins, then UNHINGES; his jaw, his mouth stretches to an inhuman size, and then a huge SWARM OF FLIES comes out of his mouth and races straight up at O'Connell and Jonathan. They both SLAM the shutters. The flies SLAM into the closed window and immediately spread throughout the bazaar. Sending people SCREAMING and running.

Daniels nods and heads out. Henderson just sits there, alone, smoking. He reaches into his jacket pocket, pulls out his SACRED CANOPIC JAR and fondles it. A BREEZE suddenly comes in through the open window. The curtains flutter. Henderson gets up and goes over to shut it. He looks out the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA races over the compound, into the window and HITS Henderson square in the FACE just as he's about to scream.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Henderson is lifted into the air by a mass of SWIRLING SAND. His body TWISTS and TURNS and Slowly SHRIVELS as the life is SUCKED out of him. Then he COLLAPSES to the floor. On the wall above him, the SHADOW of the SWIRLING SAND condenses, forming a SHADOW of a human body. The SHADOW CONVULSES as the body REGENERATES. And then it's over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Imhotep steps into view. He's regenerated even further and looks almost normal now, his face no longer decayed. He steps over Henderson's shriveled body and up to Evelyn's door, rattles the knob. it's locked. Imhotep grins.

Imhotep leans down towards Evelyn, about to kiss her as she sleeps. The door starts to CRASH and BANG from O'Connell. Imhotep ignores it. And KISSES Evelyn. His lips and mouth instantly start to DEGENERATE and DECAY. Right down to the bone. The door BURSTS OPEN. Evelyn wakes-up. Sees Imhotep's rotted mouth kissing her. She SCREAMS and shoves him away. Imhotep's putrid mouth grimaces in sadness.
</DIRECTION>

He throws the white cat at Imhotep. Imhotep instinctively catches it. He SHRIEKS, drops the cat and stumbles back towards the window, --which suddenly BLOWS OPEN. Imhotep spins like a dervish and BURSTS INTO A WHIRLWIND OF SAND. Everybody covers their eyes. The Imhotep/sand-devil EXPLODES out the window and vanishes over the compound.

Imhotep strolls through the sickened mob, his face half rotted off, his deformed mouth grinning happily. Beni is at his side, looking very nervous. And then, one-by-one', the people silently begin to follow Imhotep, their skin now covered in disgustingly hideous BOILS AND SORES.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BAZAAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The convertible hauls-ass down the narrow bazaar street. Crazies start jumping out of stalls and LEAPING onto the car. O'Connell and the others fight them off, throwing them overboard. More people JUMP on. Jonathan SWERVES the car, CRASHES through some stalls, knocking them off, but not before they manage to open the back door and YANK Daniels out. He TUMBLES across the pavement. Gets up SHOOTING. Backs into a corner, FIRING his pistol into the hideous rabble, killing several, keeping them at bay. His gun goes empty, CLICK! CLICK! CLICK! But the mob stays back, looking at him like rabid vultures. Daniels eyes them, filled with fear. The mob parts like the red sea as Imhotep walks through them and up to Daniels. Daniels whimpers in fear, tears pour down his cheeks. Then he gets an idea, reaches into his pocket, and pulls out his jewel encrusted SACRED CANOPIC JAR. He holds it out for Imhotep. Imhotep takes it and grins. Through his tears, Daniels grins back, hopeful that he'll be spared.

They all leap out of the car. But the angry, festering mob quickly surrounds them. O'Connell quickly reaches into his gunny-sack, pulls out a stick of dynamite, then reaches into his pocket and pulls out a match. He looks around for a way to light it, then reaches over and strikes it across Ardeth Bay's stubbly face. Ardeth Bay YELPS. O'Connell holds the lit match near the fuse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crazed, CHANTING mob gives O'Connell a wide berth, staring at him and the others with insane, bloodshot eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then Imhotep steps through, --having fully regenerated, he now looks as young and handsome and muscular as he did the day he was buried alive. Evelyn stares at him.

</DIRECTION>
<JONATHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say, gents! You should come have a look at this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONATHAN>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
O'Connell runs up and rips the arm off Jonathan's shirt. The scarab is now BURROWING UP JONATHAN'S ARM. O'Connell whips out his butterfly-knife, snaps it open and grabs Jonathan's arm. Jonathan's eyes widen in terror as the knife passes in front of his face. Jonathan SCREAMS LOUDER, obviously being cut open. O'Connell's hand flicks something away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The scarab hits the floor and immediately starts scurrying back towards Jonathan, wanting to finish the job.

O'Connell pulls out his gun and blows it away, --BLAM!

The GUNSHOT echoes into the cemetery as Imhotep, Evelyn and Beni step6up to the strange ALTAR, where four thousand years ago Imhotep tried to bring Anck-su-namun back to life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Imhotep scowls at the sound and angrily reaches into a CANOPIC JAR. He pulls out the crusted remains of Anck-su- namun's heart, crushes it to dust in his hand and starts reading from The Book Of The Dead. Then he BLOWS the dust against a mausoleum wall, --THE WALL STARTS TO COME ALIVE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn and Beni stare at the wall, both of them wide-eyed. TWO FORMS emerge from the mausoleum's wall. Horrific-looking mummified CORPSES. , Two of Imhotep's long dead Priests. They bow to Imhotep,-then turn and move off down a passageway.

Imhotep looks at her and grins, then BACKHANDS her --WAP! Evelyn goes down for the count. Imhotep stares at her, cold, malevolent, then h e turns and walks off into the mausoleums. Beni nervously glances around, then quickly scurries away.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

THE SHAFT OF LIGHT HITS THE DISK AND QUICKLY BOUNCES AROUND THE ROOM FROM ONE DISK TO ANOTHER UNTIL THE WHOLE CHAMBER IS LIT UP. It's an enormous TREASURE CHAMBER. Filled to overflowing.

Accompanied by the same strange FLASHING LIGHT we saw at the beginning of the movie when Anck-su-namun was cursed. one last HUGE FLASH, accompanied by a BLAST OF WIND, and Imhotep is spit out and thrown to the floor. He staggers to his feet, he looks perfectly normal. His body is completely intact.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
O'Connell runs Imhotep through with the sword and shoves him backwards. Imhotep stumbles back and falls into the detritus bog. The sword still in his stomach.

O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan stand in the middle of the plateau, surrounded by stray camels. They stare off at the sandy, dusty, volcano as it continues to RUMBLE-ominously.

	Well, ...I guess we go home empty handed.

O'Connell looks at Evelyn

<O_CONNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wouldn't say that.

Evelyn returns the look, A BEAT, and then she wraps-her arms around his neck and kisses him. O'Connell ret urn s it. Jonathan just rolls his eyes, snorts in disgust and climbs up onto a camel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When the kiss is-over, O'Connell and Evelyn share a smile, then O'Connell leaps up into the saddle, reaches down, grabs Evelyn's hand and pulls her up behind him. Evelyn wraps her arms around his waist. O'Connell and Jonathan slap the reins.

	TUK-TUK-TUK!!

The camels start to move out. WE PAN DOWN: to the saddlebag behind Evelyn, hidden under the closed back flap, --we can see that it's filled with Beni's stolen TREASURE. O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan ride off into the SUNSET.
