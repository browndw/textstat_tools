SUNRISE

<DIRECTION>
Big and orange and full of hope, as sure as fate. A dawn as promising as, well, this new day... Sun is rising over...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A flat roof that stretches to the horizon. A vast expanse. A plain of gravel-embedded tar, studded with... HVAC units and power lines, the kind that service a huge commercial building. In fact this kind of building... A UNIMART store. A flagship of savings; a mother lode of low, low prices. 100,000-and-then-some square feet of the Consumer Economy...

PARKING LOT

LARRY CROWNE - A man as reliable (and predictable) as that rising sun.

Actually, he's a Team Leader of this Unimart, dressed in his un-sexy, un-fashionable, un-flattering khaki pants and Company Polo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Larry has had the ragtop down. He wrestles it up, locks the cover into place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He doesn't just walk to work, but s t r i d e s across the asphalt field like a Sultan of Sales; a Viscount of Discount. He cheers co-workers at the start of the day, shouting encouragement, flashing thumbs up, knocking on car doors and squeezing shoulders...
