A beat.

<JULIEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do they come with batteries?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIEN>
<DANIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't buy batteries?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANIEL>
<JULIEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought they came with batteries.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIEN>
<DANIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't believe you didn't check.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANIEL>
<JULIEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I bought everything you put on the list. Gloves. Pen knives. Flashlight. Batteries were not on the list.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIEN>
<DANIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why should I have to put it on the list? It's like saying to buy a car with tires.

EXT. HOUSE -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A wealthy neighborhood of Paris off the Champs Elysees. Large homes line the secluded street. We see the silhouette of a man in a Peugeot. We MOVE IN closer to see RAYMOND GAYET, 30's, waits nervously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DARK ROOM -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dark. DANIEL FORAY lights his Zippo lighter. He is late 30's, tall, handsome with eyes that seem to twinkle in the glow of the flame. Beside him is JULIEN LABESSE, 30's, hyper. Daniel places the LIGHTER on a small table and moves over to a PAINTING on the wall. Daniel stops at one, removes a pen knife and starts to cut the canvas from the frame. Daniel rolls up the canvas.
</DIRECTION>
<DANIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Julien starts to pick up the ZIPPO.
</DIRECTION>
<DANIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be careful it's...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Too Late! Julien has already picked it up. It burns his hand ans he flicks it away. It flies through the air and lands in the corner of the room. The CURTAINS catch on fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DANIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... hot!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Julien panics! He grabs the canvas out of Daniel's hand and begins beating the flames with it. Daniel looks at him with disbelief. Julien flails his arms wildly as he beats back the flames. He turns to Daniel pleased that his efforts have extinguished the fire, but unaware that the canvas has now caught on fire. A beat. Julien sees the flames and puts them out. Daniel just stares at him. He opens the canvas. The painting is ruined.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Mercedes parks in front of the Peugeot, boxing it in between it and a car behind it. The DRIVER gets out and walks away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOUSE FOYER -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Daniel and Julien move through the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DANIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Light your lighter. I can't see anything... and try not to burn down the house!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Julien remove a lighter and presses it. The entire room fills with light. Julien stares at the flame amazed.
</DIRECTION>
<OLD_MAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't move!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_MAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
They turn to see an old man standing at the top of the stairs in his bathrobe. He is frail, his face pasty white. He is holding a very long, double-barrel shotgun. Julien looks to Daniel with a 'what now' expression. The old man slowly moves down the stairs. He loses his balance and falls down the stairs, tumbling head over heals until he reaches the bottom. Daniel and Julien stare at the old man who is sprawled out on the floor, motionless.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is he dead?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIEN>
<DANIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. He looks dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANIEL>
<JULIEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He looked dead before he fell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIEN>
<DIRECTION>
The old man groans, then opens his eyes. He grabs his shotgun. Daniel and Julien run to the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOUSE -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Daniel and Julien run towards the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DANIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Start the car! Start the car!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Raymond starts the engine. Daniel and Julien rush across the street and get in the back seat. Raymond tries to pull out but there are only a few inches between the Mercedes in front and the car behind. Like a pinball stuck between two bumpers the Peugeot jerks rapidly back and forth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PEUGEOT -- CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Daniel and Julien stare angrily ar Raymond.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't think to move the car before we came out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIEN>
<DIRECTION>
Daniel looks out his window and sees... DANIEL'S POV -- the old man runs out of his house with his shotgun and heads towards the car. Raymond is desperately trying to get the car free. They all slide down as the old man fires. The windows on the left side of the car shatter.
</DIRECTION>
<DANIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Raymond, get us out of here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Raymond pops up and returns to getting the car out as the old man opens the breach of the shotgun to reload.. Raymond floors the Peugeot keeping his foot on the brake. The engine revs. He turns the wheel to the left and releases the brake. The Peugeot juts forward smashing into the rear of the Mercedes and pushing in out into the street. Before the old man can take aim the Peugeot is speeding down the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PEUGEOT -- MOVING -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Raymond bites his lip nervously as he drives. Julien finds the whole thing amusing. Daniel leans forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DANIEL>
<DIRECTION>
(to Raymond)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what makes a good get away driver?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(controlled anger)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Being able to get away!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANIEL>
<RAYMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're always pointing out my negative qualities. My analyst says positive reinforcement is a much more productive way of relating with people.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYMOND>
<JULIEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine. Raymond, we'd like to commend you on how well you fucked up tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIEN>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET, PARIS -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A narrow street. Daniel carries the cardboard tube as he walks with Julien and Raymond. They enter a WAREHOUSE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BASTALDI'S OFFICE -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two large desks are lined up face to face. One is empty. The other is occupied by LAURANT BASTALDI, 40's, all business. Off to the side is MARCEL BUROT, 40's. Daniel, Julien and Raymond enter. As they approach the desk Daniel glances at Marcel who is staring at him.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCEL>
<DIRECTION>
(amused)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I heard you almost got your ass blown off last night. Some thief. A regular black panther.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCEL>
<DIRECTION>
Marcel glances at Bastaldi to see if he appreciates his comments.
</DIRECTION>
<RAYMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A Black Panther was a member of an African American militant group in the sixties, Marcel. I think you're referring to The Pink Panther.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYMOND>
<MARCEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pink panther, black panther. Who gives a shit? And I don't remember asking you a God Damn thing, you little turd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCEL>
<RAYMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's no reason to be abusive. You're projecting your anger on me as a defense mechanism.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYMOND>
<MARCEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell is he talking about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCEL>
<RAYMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYMOND>
<MARCEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about getting on your knees and communicating with my dick?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCEL>
<BASTALDI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up! Both of you! You're giving me a fuckin' headache.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BASTALDI>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. Raymond and Marcel stare at one another. We HEAR a muffled GROANING SOUND in the b.g.
</DIRECTION>
<DANIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's your brother?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANIEL>
<BASTALDI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vincent's in the States on business.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat; referring to the painting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BASTALDI>
<DIRECTION>
Daniel lays the cardboard tube containing the painting on the desk. Bastaldi removes the painting. To him it is not a work of art, just a commodity to be sold. He opens his desk drawer, removes several large stacks of money and hands them to Daniel.
</DIRECTION>
<BASTALDI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Now I've got something I want to --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BASTALDI>
<DIRECTION>
We HEAR the groaning sound again. Bastaldi looks irritated. He gets up and walks over to a closet. He opens to the doors to reveal a man in his underwear, his wrists tied behind his back, his mouth taped shut. A wire noose is around his neck forcing him to stand on his tip toes to avoid hanging himself.
</DIRECTION>
<BASTALDI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you mind? I'm trying to do some business here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BASTALDI>
<DIRECTION>
The man looks at Bastaldi through pleading eyes and mumbles something.
</DIRECTION>
<BASTALDI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One more sound out of you and I'm going to cut your fuckin' tongue out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BASTALDI>
<DIRECTION>
Bastaldi closes the door. Daniel looks at him inquisitively.
</DIRECTION>
<BASTALDI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You take someone in. Give them a steady job and how do they repay you? By claiming to misplace a shipment of your merchandise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BASTALDI>
<RAYMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe he did misplace it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYMOND>
<BASTALDI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You misplace your car keys. You misplace your cell phone. You do not misplace one hundred and forty seven wide-screen TV's!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BASTALDI>
<DANIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Laurant, how long has he been in there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Bastaldi looks puzzled.
</DIRECTION>
<BASTALDI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. What day is today?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BASTALDI>
<JULIEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thursday.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIEN>
<BASTALDI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it Thursday already? This week has just shot by.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BASTALDI>
<DIRECTION>
Bastaldi thinks about something for a moment, then...
</DIRECTION>
<BASTALDI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You and your crew speak English, don't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BASTALDI>
<DIRECTION>
Daniel is still staring at the closet.
</DIRECTION>
<BASTALDI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey Daniel! Hello?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(snaps his fingers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you guys speak English?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BASTALDI>
<DANIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANIEL>
<BASTALDI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. I have a job for you in America.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BASTALDI>
<DIRECTION>
Bastaldi tosses a photo of a middle-aged American couple. He points to a diamond necklace around the woman's neck.
</DIRECTION>
<BASTALDI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Taylors from Chicago. Very rich. An acquaintance of mine recently quit working for Mrs. Taylor as an assistant. She tells me they keep all their jewelry in a safe in their bedroom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BASTALDI>
<JULIEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It seems like a long way to go for a necklace.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIEN>
<DANIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Besides, we don't know the city and--
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANIEL>
<MARCEL>
<DIRECTION>
(overlapping)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Bastaldi isn't asking you if you want to go. He's telling you you're going! And if he's telling you you're going to be going then you are going to go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCEL>
<BASTALDI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you Marcel, for that... extremely redundant explanation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BASTALDI>
<DANIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, Laurant, America?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANIEL>
<BASTALDI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The job is worth about two million euros. Pull this off and you and your crew could make some real money, Daniel. You leave tomorrow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BASTALDI>
<DIRECTION>
They know they don't have a choice.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're going to need to find someone who knows the city.

</JULIEN>
<MARCEL>

EXT. NOTRE DAME -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The plaza is filled with tourists. Moving through the crowd is SAMI ZERHOUNI, Algerian, late 20's, a small time street hustler, dressed in jeans and a "I Love Paris" tee-shirt. He passes a MAN who is about to take a picture and lifts his wallet. Sami moves on. He sees two overweight women standing at a vendor's cart, holding a large wad of MONEY. The woman puts the cash back in her purse, but does not zip it up. Sami moves in behind her and slips his hand into the purse. She zips the bag closed. Sami's face fills with pain as the zipper catches the hair of his arm. The women walk towards the cathedral. Sami has no choice but follow after them. He tries to match their pace so he doesn't alert them of his presence. The woman looks back and sees Sami's hand. She pulls her bag away, ripping a section of hair off his arm, then swings the bag, putting all of her weight behind it. It hits Sami squarely in the face. He lands on his back with a thud. WALLETS and BILLFOLDS fly out from every one of his pockets. He staggers to his feet and starts to pick up the wallets when he sees...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS POV -- ACROSS THE PLAZA: of two police officers moving towards him . He knows he has no more time. He takes off running, disappearing into the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAFE -- LATIN QUARTER -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sami is at the bar. He sees Marcel enter and runs towards the back. Standing in his way is one of Marcel's MEN. Sami turns around as Marcel approaches and forces a smile. NOTE: All dialogue is now in English unless otherwise noted.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Going somewhere?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCEL>
<SAMI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Marcel! I thought you were somebody else. If I knew it was you I would have never run.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMI>
<DIRECTION>
A long, awkward beat as Marcel just glares at him.
</DIRECTION>
<SAMI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're probably here for the money I owe you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off Marcel's nod)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't have it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Marcel opens the door to the bathroom and pushes Sami inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marcel closes the door. He is face to face with Sami.
</DIRECTION>
<SAMI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know this is how rumors get started.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMI>
<DIRECTION>
Marcel punches Sami in the stomach. He drops to his knees. A beat. The door to the bathroom opens and the LARGE MAN peers inside. He stares awkwardly at what he perceives as the beginning of a sexual act.
</DIRECTION>
<SAMI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Told you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMI>
<DIRECTION>
Marcel slams the door then grabs Sami by the ear and yanks him to his feet.

	Yeah, I can see that.

</SAMI>
<MARCEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Normally I'd be breaking your fingers right now, but I'm going to give you a chance to make enough to pay me back and have some extra for yourself. We have a group going to Chicago to do a job. You're going with them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCEL>
<SAMI>

Marcel glares at him.

	<DIALOGUE>
	But I'd be... I'd be happy to go.
	</DIALOGUE>

Marcel stares at him with hard expression.
</DIRECTION>

	If you try to leave town I'll know. If you manage to leave town I'll find you... and the next time we meet in a bathroom I'll be cutting you up into little pieces.

	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMI>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens. ZERO enters. No one knows his last name. He is 40's, blonde hair, leather jacket, black pants. Looks more like a rock-star than a criminal. His eyes are flat and there is an intensity about him that is unnerving. Zero casually nods to Daniel. Zero stares at Sami as Daniel leads him over.
</DIRECTION>
<DANIEL>

	<DIALOGUE>
	This is Zero.

</SAMI>

Sami laughs at his little joke. The others cringe. One look in Zero's eyes tells Sami what everyone else already knows: This is not someone to fuck with. Julien puts his arm around Sami and leads him away from the others.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me give you some advice. You don't want to piss him off because he'll kill you for the fun of it. What you want to do is keep your mouth shut and do what we tell you.

<DANIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANIEL>
<BASTALDI>

<DANIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't trust me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANIEL>
<BASTALDI>

INT. LIMO -- MOVING -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For many of them this is the first time they have ever been inside a limo. Julien pours himself a drink. Sami plays around with the air conditioner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zero turns on the radio and clicks through a few stations until he comes to RENAUD singing "Des que le vent souffera." He leans back in his seat, bobbing his head to the music. Marcel doesn't like it. He changes the station. We hear JOHNNY HALLYDAY singing, "Que je taime."
</DIRECTION>
<MARCEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCEL>
<DIRECTION>
Zero doesn't like it. He pushes the button returning to the Renaud song and stares at Marcel. Marcel, not to be outdone returns the Hallyday song. Like two children they click the buttons of the radio, switching back and forth between Renaud and Hallyday. Bastaldi has had enough.
</DIRECTION>
<BASTALDI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop it! Both of you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BASTALDI>
<DIRECTION>
He turns off the radio. A long beat. Marcel, like a child who has to have the last word starts singing to himself quietly, but loud enough for Zero to hear.
</DIRECTION>

Quick cuts of the familiar sights of the city. The Sears building. Chicago board of trade building. Grant park. Then with each successive cut the beauty of the city seems to fade until we are in...

EXT. STREET -- MORNING

<DIRECTION>
An industrial section of the city. Empty streets. Run down buildings. Graffiti filled walls and burnt out hulls of abandoned cars line the street. The taxi driver leans out his window.

The taxi speeds off, leaving them standing on the sidewalk, their bags in a pile. Suddenly, from out of nowhere three BLACK TOUGHS appear and walk over. Daniel looks behind him and sees another two approaching from the rear. Zero calmly sits down on one of the suitcases.

Raymond steps forward and places his hand on Lamar's arm.

Zero stands up and raises his hand. He is holding a .9mm Glock. He aims it at Lamar's head.

Lamar's brave exterior quickly fades now that he is looking down the barrel of the gun. The rest of his gang turns and runs away. Zero aims the gun at his groin.

Lamar runs away. Daniel and the others smile at Zero as they pick up their bags and walk towards a building.

Zero is left with Sami who stares at him with disbelief.

Of to the side, sitting on the couch is WAYNE, 20's, a burn-out with long hair and a scraggly goatee. His face is buried in a bong as he sucks in a lung full of marijuana. He watches a cartoon show on the television.

Two GANGSTERS stand on each side of Vinny. They are JOEY "TWO TONS" 40's, could have a second career as a Sumo Wrestler. NICKY "THE RAKE", 30's, thin a rail. They make a strange pair but they both have one thing in common: They are stone cold killers. Standing in front of the them is FRANKIE ZAMMITO, 30's, a wise guy, tough as they come. He wears a well tailored suit, black leather gloves and polished shoes.

	That's right. I said don't do it. Did you listen to me? No. You wanted the money. So, I lent you twenty large. Now it's been three weeks and you ain't paid a dime. What do you think that makes me look like on the street? I don't do something to you and everyone will think they can skate.

EXT. SIDE OF WAREHOUSE -- AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Raymond walks towards a door at the end of the building. The MUSIC grows louder. He KNOCKS on the door and waits. It is opened by a very large man... a biker type, leather jacket, full beard, several long earrings hanging from his ear. He is holding a BEER BOTTLE. Behind him are two other rough-looking men.

The music continues to pound through the walls. A soggy Raymond steps into the room. He walks over to a chair and sits down, his head hung down, embarrassed. Marcel is angered by this. He glances over to Daniel who subtly nods to him. Marcel leaves the room.

EXT. SIDE OF WAREHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER -- AFTERNOON

Marcel walks purposefully along the side of the building. He reaches into his jacket pocket and removes two black leather gloves. He slips them on as he approaches the door, then knocks. A beat. The Biker opens the door.

<BIKER>

	Listen asshole, I told you --

</BIKER>

Marcel head butts him, slamming his forehead into the bridge of his nose. The Biker clasps his hands over his bleeding nose. Marcel grabs him by the hair and rapidly punches him in face several times -- each punch backing the Biker into the room.

INT. BIKER'S WAREHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>

On the last punch the Biker falls backwards crashing through a large glass coffee table.

BIKER #2 moves in behind Marcel and throws a hard punch as Marcel turns around. Marcel bends his head down, so that his attackers fists slams into the hard crown of his skull.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BIKER #2 painfully grabs his broken knuckles. Marcel knees him hard in the groin. BIKER #2 turns to his side and doubles over. Marcel kicks the man into the back of his knee spinning him around and down on his knees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a fluid movement he elbows the man in the back of head . BIKER #2 falls face forwards and is out cold. Marcel turns to the third BIKER who is standing by the stereo. He is smaller than the others and has seen enough. He quickly turns off the power. DEAD QUIET.

Ellwood slumps down on the bed, dead. The black guy who has heard nothing continues searching under the bed. Zero casually picks up the suitcase filled with guns and hands it to Daniel. They walk out of the room. Lamar stands there, stunned, then quickly runs after them.

Daniel is waiting, holding the other black canvas bag. As Lamar passes they quickly exchange bags.

From Hadley's point of view Lamar has merely run behind the statue as he heads for the street. Lamar runs a few more steps, then stumbles and falls... several cassette tapes spill out of it. Lamar's buddies are already at the street.

	It's a little arty I know, but it has great content, don't you think? You were so busy looking for a wire you probably didn't even think about a video camera. It was on the statue. Anyway, I've sent a copy of the whole tape to the Chicago P.D. and the FBI. They'll get it tomorrow. If I were you I'd take the day off.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Put the money in the rowboat and untie it. The current will carry it down river. When we see that the money is there I'll call back and tell you where the tapes are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANIEL>
<DIRECTION>
DANIEL'S POV: Bastaldi appears on deck. He puts the suitcase in the rowboat and unties it. It drifts slowly into the current.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DOWN RIVER -- AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rowboat hugs the shore, moving slowly down the river. Marcel is on the shore with Raymond. Raymond reaches out with a long pole and pulls the boat to shore. Marcel opens the case. Inside are several stacks of five hundred franc notes. Marcel looks to Raymond with a grin and nods. Raymond opens his cell phone.

INT. HOUSEBOAT -- AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bastaldi enters, looks around the room until he sees the wooden chest. He walks over and opens it. Inside there are several cassette tapes in the cardboard box. Bastaldi grins and lifts the cardboard box out of the chest. He hears a CLICK. He notices something is attached to the bottom of the cardboard box. It's a long thin wire that has pulled the pin on an electronic device.

EXT. ACROSS THE RIVER -- CONTINUOUS

Daniel is now holding small, black device. A yellow light starts flashing. He puts his finger on a red button.

EXT. HOUSEBOAT -- FIVE SECONDS LATER

The houseboat explodes in a brilliant fireball, sending pieces of wood and metal flying into the air. A thick plume of black smoke swirls in the wind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ACROSS THE RIVER -- AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Daniel, Raymond, Sami, Raymond, Marcel and Zero watch the smoldering wreckage. Their blank faces show no emotion -- just a sense that justice has been done.
</DIRECTION>
<SAMI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you have to use that much explosive?

<DANIEL>

	</DIALOGUE>
</DANIEL>

Raymond opens the suitcase and looks inside. As he peels through the stacks of money we see that only the top bill of each stack is real -- underneath them all is white paper, cut to the same size as the bills. Everyone turns to Marcel.
</DIRECTION>
<DANIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't check it?

The five of them walk across the bridge.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry! I was caught up in the excitement of the moment. I should have checked. I made a mistake. I suppose that none of you have ever made a mistake before?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCEL>
<DIRECTION>
No one answers him. Sami reaches inside the black canvas bag and removes the autographed baseball Marcel took from Zammito.
</DIRECTION>
<SAMI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is great. After everything we've been through we've got eight hundred euros and an autographed baseball.

	Raymond, don't you think they're over reacting a little?

</MARCEL>
<RAYMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I think they have a right to express their anger with you in light of the fact that you're...

	A FUCKIN' MORON! HOW COULD YOU NOT CHECK
	</DIALOGUE>

	THE MONEY, YOU GOD DAMN STUPID SHIT-HEAD!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Raymond's anger takes everyone by surprise. Even Raymond is surprised by his outburst.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine. All of you want to be angry? Be angry... but I'm the one who took the ball and that makes it mine.

</MARCEL>
<SAMI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.

	Give it to me, Sami.

<SAMI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMI>
<DIRECTION>
Marcel tries to take the ball out of the bag. Sami pulls it away. Marcel grabs the bag. Both of them tug on it. Marcel pulls hard and the bag rips down the seam. The baseball falls out and rolls off the bridge into the river.
</DIRECTION>
<SAMI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perfect.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMI>
<DIRECTION>
Marcel stands there holding the inside liner of the bag. Sami throws the canvas bag to the ground in frustration. Something catches Daniel's attention.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DANIEL'S POV -- of the black canvas. The lining has been ripped away. A light breeze blows lifting the underside of the black canvas. There is a flash of color. Another gust of wind turns the black canvas over. On the other side is Van Gogh's "Vase with twelve sunflowers".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Daniel's jaw drops. The others notice his stunned expression and follow his stare.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THEIR POV -- of the priceless painting. They stand there, too shocked to move at first, then rush forward. They have almost reached the painting when a truck passes them. The wind kicks up the painting, blowing it over the railing. They reach out to grab it, but it is too far away. They stand there, watching as it slowly floats down to the river below.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. BRIDGE -- WIDE SHOT -- AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They look at one an other, then without speaking a word they all jump off the bridge. As they fall towards the water we... FREEZE FRAME
