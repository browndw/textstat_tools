INT. MEDIEVAL TIMES THEATER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A familiar beam of light shines down. The beam of light descends onto a stage. Lightning flashes to reveal Prince Charming riding his valiant steed Chauncey across the open plains. The wind blows back his golden mane.
</DIRECTION>
<PRINCE_CHARMING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Onward Chauncey, to the highest room of the tallest tower! Where my princess awaits rescue from her handsome Prince Charming.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCE_CHARMING>
<DIRECTION>
Lightning cracks. Thunder booms. Charming straddles a wooden hobby horse and gallops in place. A stage hand uses a bellow to blow air into Prince Charming's face. Another stage hand turns a crank that creates the moving background. In the orchestra, a man uses coconuts to create the sound effects of a galloping horse. Two more stage hands back stage create the cheap sound effects of thunder and lightning. A crudely constructed castle tower sits in front of a cheaply painted backdrop.

The Fairytale Creatures are sitting at a table in the audience.

Prince Charming sits at his broken vanity and sobs. His make- shift dressing room is in an alley way next to the theater.

Horses whinny as a carriage passes by. The castle of Far Far Away can be seen on the hill in the background. Prince Charming breaks down and cries.

Suddenly Shrek's arms and legs are strapped into a chair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A man stands with his back to the camera and pulls on a rip cord as if he's holding a chain saw. VROOM! VROOM! He turns around to reveal a circular sander and starts to grind away at Shrek's gruesome toenails. Shrek cringes.

As he is stumbling, he grabs hold of a lady in the crowd.

	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The woman pushes Donkey away. He falls, knocking over a guard holding an axe on his way down. The guard drops the axe. It flies past Puss, who is in the arms of a lady. The axe knocks over a vase. The vase flies up on stage and Fiona maneuvers to catch it. In flight, water spills out of the vase which causes Fiona to fall over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shrek's tuxedo bib slaps him in the face. The clasp holding Shrek's pants up breaks off. Shrek stands on stage with his pants around his ankles. He shuffles towards Fiona.

</DIRECTION>
<FIDDLESWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ahhhh!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FIDDLESWORTH>
<DIRECTION>
The skewers fly through the air. Donkey stands up in frame with one eye half shut. The flaming skewers shoot by him and land in the curtains, setting them on fire. He blows one of the skewers out and takes a bite.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, you had me at "vermin-filled."

</ARTIE>
<SHREK>

	</DIALOGUE>
</SHREK>
<DIRECTION>
As soon as the word leaves his lips, Shrek knows he's gone too far. Stung, Artie lets go of the wheel, leaving Shrek to yank hard on it. He pulls the steering column from the decking.
