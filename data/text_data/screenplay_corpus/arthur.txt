EXT. MANHATTAN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HOMELESS MAN, who from his tatty suit may have been a top broker this time last year, is picking through a bin in Manhattan's deserted night-time financial district.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The street starts to vibrate. A TERRIFYING GROWL approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A huge black shape smashes into view - THE DARK KNIGHT'S BATMOBILE! Our audience wonder if they've wandered into the wrong movie. The Homeless Man dives for cover.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BAM! The Batmobile smashes into a row of parked cars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear manic laughing from inside the car, which screeches and careers violently into a sign reading `WALL STREET'.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sirens herald THREE POLICE CARS in hot pursuit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Batmobile roars up Wall Street, bashing against the New York Stock Exchange, thumping up and down the Federal Hall's steps and finally smashing at high speed into the rear end of the famous 'Charging Bull' statue. Two enormous bronze testicles thud onto the Batmobile's bonnet and roll away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cop cars screech up, surrounding the Batmobile. TWO OLDER COPS and A ROOKIE surround it, weapons drawn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HELICOPTER appears, blazing the Batmobile in white light.
</DIRECTION>
<ROOKIE_COP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cooool.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROOKIE_COP>
<DIRECTION>
An older Cop flashes the rookie a dirty look, then points a FLASHLIGHT into a tiny window. THE BATMAN - actually drunken English socialite ARTHUR BACH TEMPLEMEAD in a costume - lowers the window and offers a handshake.

	</DIALOGUE>
</OLDER_COP_1>
<ARTHUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Terribly sorry, but in the film they used a different model to show the old Batchap getting in and out. This one has no doors, so I'd have to squeeze out the back arsehole first. Which nobody wants...

	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a joke! Okay, okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARTHUR>
<DIRECTION>
Arthur wriggles awkwardly out of a rear hatch. The bronze bull teeters, a little scarily. He stands, wobbly. His Batman utility belt features a big water pistol, a firework, a hip flask and line of shot glasses. And, inexplicably, a big red stapler. The younger cop is desperately fighting the giggles.
</DIRECTION>
<OLDER_COP_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, explain everything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLDER_COP_1>
<ARTHUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well. What with having spunked 1.6 million fat Alberts on this little runaround, I thought why not take it a step further and try to actually collar a few ne-er do wells? It worked for the billionaire Bruce Wayne, why not the future billionaire Arthur Bach- Templemead? Will I have to do traffic school?

The cop shines his flashlight back inside, revealing A BEARDED HOMELESS OLD MAN IN A CRAPPY 60S `ROBIN' costume.

	</DIALOGUE>
</HOMELESS_ROBIN>

Arthur counts out a huge wad of cash.
</DIRECTION>
<ARTHUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Boy Homeless here neglected to say he'd never driven. Or that the only reason he's sober is to be ready for the conspiracy of leopards about to seize Manhattan.

</ARTHUR>
<HOMELESS_ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's LIZARDS! English prick!

Arthur hands another wad of cash to Cop 1.

Arthur sits, minus mask, in a cell with Homeless Robin and VARIOUS CRIMINALS and DRUNKS, including A HUGE GUY IN A CHICAGO CUBS SHIRT, sporting a terrifically swollen eye.

A different, extremely flashy car zips through Central Park, the back full of released crooks, the huge Chicago guy - his name's MARTY - at the wheel.

<ARTHUR>
<DIRECTION>
Not after you ran him over in the Bentley, no. Susan's boring. She's not funny.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIENNE>

Ditto your father. The aristocracy doesn't marry for `fun', Arthur. It's about stability. Continuity...

<ARTHUR>

...and sinking your fangs into Susan's father's bank account.

<VIVIENNE>

The Johnson family's considerable equity in a stormy financial period is merely a side issue. Burt is a pillar of the community.
</DIRECTION>
<ARTHUR>
<DIRECTION>
His baby formula was taken off the market in six African countries!
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIENNE>
<DIRECTION>
A completely innocent error in places where there's precious little for children to live for anyway. The families all got gift baskets as compensation. That little bump in the road aside, Burt is a devout Christian.

Yes, because they're never insane. And where did he get Jesus?

I'm sorry, Vivienne. I've met someone else very lovely who, as far as I know, isn't related to anyone who would kill an unsung hero in cold blood.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIENNE>

Un-meet her. Arthur, you're the end of our line. We need an heir.

I nearly gave you an heir!

Oh, give me strength! A Bach- Templemead having a child by a lap dancer called `Mystery'?

That was just her stage name! To give her more mystery when she...waved her fanny around. Her real name was...what was it again?
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIENNE>
<DIRECTION>
Susan is 33 this year. Her egg inventory has dropped by 23% since you met her. You risk having no sons, or worse, some pea-brained hunchback who hugs everyone!
</DIRECTION>
<ARTHUR>
<DIRECTION>
Great! I like hugs! And some of them are really good at math. (heading to the door) You know the `Frog and Toad' books?
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIENNE>
<DIRECTION>
No.
</DIRECTION>
<ARTHUR>
<DIRECTION>
Of course you don't. Hobson read them to me while you were off riding horses over stripey poles. They're about fun and friendship, not how many unspasticated tadpoles I can squirt up a rich girl.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIENNE>
<DIRECTION>
Your father would turn in his grave to hear this nonsense...

Arthur turns the fan on a low setting. It rotates slowly, the head going around with it. Burt turns away to pour more water.

	Why would you do that? You'd never get it back.

There's a ring at the doorbell. Ralph answers. It's Hobson.

<HOBSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good afternoon, Mr Snart. Is Naomi here?

<RALPH>

Ralph embraces her.

Ralph releases her.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you and your undershirt would walk two paces back I could enter this dwelling.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOBSON>

Naomi appears, looking more of a writer than a tour guide.
</DIRECTION>
<NAOMI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NAOMI>
<RALPH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ever since I met Arthur I liked him. We have to make sure these two wonderful kids stay together...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RALPH>
<HOBSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Try not to talk. It's not your words but the breath which bears them. Perhaps you could repair to the East Wing and make me a cup of tea? I wish to speak to Naomi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOBSON>
<RALPH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, sure.

</HOBSON>
<NAOMI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell him thanks, but I have a deadline.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NAOMI>
<HOBSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Arthur doesn't know I'm here. He's far too decent to be involved in something so tawdry. You could bring your father. A magical experience before he's too big to leave this apartment.

<NAOMI>
<DIRECTION>
(DISBELIEF)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why would I go to this? Why would I do that to myself?

</NAOMI>
<HOBSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My dear, if there's one thing old women can tell, it's young men in love. And the food promises to be breathtakingly free.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOBSON>
<DIRECTION>
Hobson has a slight dizzy spell and sits down.
</DIRECTION>
<NAOMI>

</NAOMI>
<HOBSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Better than you, dear.

	You really look out for Arthur, don't you?

</NAOMI>
<HOBSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. And it is a job that I recommend highly.

</HOBSON>
<DIRECTION>
Ralph comes back and with a cup of disgusting-looking tea.
</DIRECTION>
<HOBSON>

	You really look out for this gentleman, from what I've heard.

	Ah, what am I gonna do? The no-kill pet shelter won't take him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NAOMI>
<DIRECTION>
Ralph hands Hobson the cup of tea.
</DIRECTION>
<HOBSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you. Would you go the bathroom and commence washing? You only have three hours and it could be quite a project.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOBSON>
<DIRECTION>
Ralph goes. Naomi takes the tea.
</DIRECTION>
<NAOMI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I appreciate what you're trying to do but I'm not going to that party.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NAOMI>
<HOBSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Suit yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOBSON>

Hobson gets up, still dizzy.

<NAOMI>
	<DIALOGUE>

</NAOMI>
<HOBSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. And he has seen me.

</HOBSON>
<NAOMI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think Arthur has a very good friend. May I kiss you on the cheek?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NAOMI>
<HOBSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it something you feel strongly about?

Naomi climbs out of a crappy cab. She's on her phone.

Hobson's in bed looking ill. Ralph's fussing over her pillow. Hobson slaps him away.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Burt takes to the stage to applause.
</DIRECTION>
<BURT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When Arthur proposed to my daughter, I was overjoyous. The Bach-Templemeads are my kind of people: classy. Respectable. Well spoken. People like in Shakespeare in Love, who esprouse the same values I have always upheld both in my business and spiritual life. But tonight isn't about me or America's leading independent formula brand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURT>
<DIRECTION>
Arthur takes the stage to wild applause.

Arthur sees a sound system. He goes over and plugs his iPhone into it, then takes Naomi in his arms.

	My son became fond of you. You're not the first. Or the last, I imagine. Anyway I was scanning his monthly expenses - which always makes for entertaining reading, all those gifts for all those girls - and found he'd bought an entire publishing company called...what was it now? Rainbow Press.

<NAOMI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You bought Rainbow press? So you could tell them to publish my book?
