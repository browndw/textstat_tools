	You know the problem with Hollywood? They make shit. Unbelievable, unremarkable shit. I'm not some grungy filmmaker- wannabee searching for existentialism through a haze of bong-smoke. It's easy to pick apart bad acting, short-sighted directing, or the purely moronic stringing together of words many of the studios term as prose. No, I'm talking the lack of realism. Realism. Not a pervasive element in the modern American cinematic vision.

Three men sit at a window booth drinking coffee and talking. Two of the men sit on one side of the table; STANLEY is in his early thirties, AGENT ROBERTS, early forties. Both wear suits, the younger's is fairly expensive and well cut, the other's is polyester, enough said. The MAN across, however, is quite different. He is what they used to call a "cool-cat."

	<DIALOGUE>
	Take Dog Day Afternoon for example. Arguably Pacino's greatest performance, excepting The Godfather, Part I, and Scarface, of course. A masterpiece of directing, easily Lumet's best. The acting, the script, cinematography, all top notch. But, they didn't push the envelope. What if in Dog Day, Sonny really wanted to get away with it? What if, and here's where it gets tricky. What if they'd started killing hostages? No mercy, no quarter, meet our demands or the cute blonde in the bell bottoms gets one in the back of the head, bam, splatter. What? Still no bus? How many innocent victims would they let get sprayed across the windows before the city reversed its policy on hostage situations? And this was 1976. No C.N.N., no C.N.B.C., no M.T.V. No Internet. Fast forward to the present, same situation. Can you imagine the feeding frenzy of the modern media? In hours it would be the top story from Boston to Budapest. All caught in 150 millimeter zoom, computer enhanced, and color corrected. You would practically taste the brain matter. Six hostages die. Ten. Twelve. Twenty. Thirty. Relentless. One after another. All over a bus, a plane, and a couple of million dollars that were federally insured.

Gabriel and Stanley stop just outside the doorway. Gabriel dons a pair of hip little shades, then continues across the sidewalk and into the street.

He nonchalantly looks up. Suddenly the THUMP of HELICOPTERS and the WAIL of SIRENS dominates the soundtrack.

Pandemonium. HELICOPTERS RIP the sky, L.A. County PD and a bunch of news vultures. Squad cars block off both ends of the street while SWAT trucks, news vans, and looky- loos are packed together into the distance.

Sharpshooters lean out of windows and snipers are positioned on every open rooftop. Hundreds of weapons are pointed at this man who saunters across the street as if he's on his way to Sunday service, without a care in the world.

Slowly, Stanley follows Gabriel into the street.

All but one of the front windows of the bank, the one with the door in it, has been welded over with 3/4 inch plate steel.

Over two dozen hostages lie face down on the floor, arms cable-tied behind their backs. Something has been duct- taped around their chests and each is wearing what appears to be a dog collar.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stanley and Ginger walk into a large area with individual private booths in small rooms around the perimeter. The rooms have the ability to be closed off by drawing huge, thick velvet drapes.
</DIRECTION>
<GINGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wish you'd let me buy you a suit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GINGER>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm happy with what I'm wearing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANLEY>
<GINGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have no self-esteem, Stanley.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GINGER>
<STANLEY>
<DIRECTION>
(dryly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANLEY>
<DIRECTION>
They walk into one of the booths in the back. Sitting around a large, oval table is our antihero, Gabriel Shear, surrounded by a handful of his crew and a gaggle of beautiful model-types.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ginger kisses Gabriel and with a healthy exchange of fluids, then...
</DIRECTION>
<GINGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miss me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GINGER>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel smiles, then looks back at Stanley.
</DIRECTION>
<GINGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gabriel, Stanley. Stanley, Gabriel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GINGER>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel just stares.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
(very familiar)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Big Stan. Nice suit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANLEY>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, they say it's the clothes that make the man...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You buy it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANLEY>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hope not.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Buy you a drink?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I flew fifteen hundred miles for this meeting, how 'bout we get to the point.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANLEY>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually you flew 1500 miles for 100 grand. But that's not the point.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Stanley sits down. Gabriel pours Stan a glass of Crown.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I heard this story about this young hacker who made a virus that broke the F.B.I.'s Carnivore program that was actively reading every subscriber's E-mail and scrambled the systems. He did what the federal judges wouldn't do and kept the government out of our Privacy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I heard that. Story is he went to jail and the federal Carnivore program is back in full swing. It was a real tragedy. What can I do for you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Changing the subject.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stanley, meet Helga.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The beautiful WOMAN to Stanley's right slides closer.
</DIRECTION>
<HELGA>
<DIRECTION>
(WOMAN) (heavily accented)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Stanley.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELGA>
<DIRECTION>
Stanley looks at her, she's a knockout; artificially perfect. He looks back at Gabriel.
</DIRECTION>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I don't have a lot of patience for this --
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANLEY>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stanley, we have a problem, maybe you can help us out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Stan looks around; everyone is smiling. Helga moves closer to him.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take a look at this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
He is handed an open laptop, it glows. He sets it on the table and spins it around in front of Stanley.
</DIRECTION>
<STANLEY>
<DIRECTION>
(like an alcoholic faced with a fifth of tequila)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know I can't touch that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Helga pours a shot of tequila.
</DIRECTION>
<HELGA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You like tequila, Stanley?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELGA>
<DIRECTION>
Helga shoots the tequila, then turns to Stanley, places her lips against his. The gold liquid drips from their lips as she spits it into Stanley's mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pushes her away, breaking the liplock, and swallowing the tequila. She licks it from his face.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No need for modesty, we're all friends here, Stanley.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is bullshit. I came --
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANLEY>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want something from me, amigo, I want something from you. D.O.D. dBase, 128 bit R.S.A. encryption. Whattaya think? Impossible?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Stanley's having a little trouble concentrating on Gabriel.
</DIRECTION>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing's impossible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Helga begins sucking on Stanley's fingers. He pulls them away.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So it can be done? Maybe slide in a Trojan horse hiding a worm?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something like that. Is this an interview?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANLEY>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sort of. Marco, let's give him some incentive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
The drapes close. Two of Gabriel's crew step out. Marco yanks out a .40 caliber Glock and quickly screws a well- used silencer onto the end. Marco walks around behind Stanley.
</DIRECTION>
<STANLEY>
<DIRECTION>
(now totally confused)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Helga smiles, then drops her head into Stanley's lap. We hear his PANTS UNZIP.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Relax, Stanley.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
He has to go with it.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been told the best crackers in the world could do this in sixty minutes. Unfortunately, I need someone who can do it in sixty seconds.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're kidding...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANLEY>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Fraid not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Stan realizes now no one is smiling. He grabs the blonde by the hair but can't pull her up.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forty-five seconds. Time is a wasting, big guy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
The silencer is pressed into the back of his head. Stanley tries to focus on the screen. Stanley sucks air through his teeth, trying to focus.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have thirty seconds, Stanley.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Stanley gives up on trying to get her up and his hands start flying over the keyboard. We INTERCUT the ACTION WITH a CLOSEUP of Stanley's hands working the keyboard, and a CLOSEUP of Gabriel, and a CLOSEUP of the LCD screen which reads in flashing red letters --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"ACCESS DENIED."
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's very good, isn't she, Stanley?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Tension builds as Stanley continues to work the keyboard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"ACCESS DENIED."
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, Stanley. 20 seconds.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
"ACCESS DENIED."
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fifteen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
"ACCESS DENIED."
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ten... Nine...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Faster and faster. "ACCESS DENIED."
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Three... Two...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
"ACCESS DENIED."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs her head. She doesn't come up. The screen flashes:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"ACCESS DENIED."
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too bad, Stanley. Ya gotta die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Marco puts the silencer to his eye.
</DIRECTION>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait... !
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANLEY>
<DIRECTION>
CLICK. The GUN is empty. Stanley tries to catch his breath. Helga lifts up her head. Everyone laughs. Gabriel walks around the table.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was just fucking with you, Stan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Stanley is pissed. Helga, smiling, kisses him on the cheek. Stanley tries to calm down. He gets up, shoots someone's half-drank drink, zips his pants, then --
</DIRECTION>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So was I.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Stanley hits the enter key and spins the computer around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP - COMPUTER SCREEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"ACCESS GRANTED" appears, and the Department of Defense logo scrolls across the screen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stanley gives them all a "fuck you" smile, then stomps out through the curtain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP ON GABRIEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
who smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. CLUB - REST ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stanley pushes into the bathroom. He kicks the wastebasket across the room.
</DIRECTION>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANLEY>
<DIRECTION>
He pushes a club kid out of the way of the sink. He turns on the water and washes his face. Slowly he leans his forehead against the mirror. Ginger appears behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you looking at?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANLEY>
<GINGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Relax, Stanley. You can do this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GINGER>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get away from me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANLEY>
<GINGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to help you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GINGER>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help? Help what, squeegee my brain off the ceiling?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANLEY>
<GINGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was just a test, Stan, you passed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GINGER>
<DIRECTION>
Ginger pulls out a cigarette and a lighter from her plastic overcoat.
</DIRECTION>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A test... I don't know why I let you talk me into this. I can't believe how desperate I am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANLEY>
<DIRECTION>
She exhales toward Stanley.
</DIRECTION>
<GINGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you were here saving your daughter, Stanley.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GINGER>
<DIRECTION>
He turns around.
</DIRECTION>
<STANLEY>
<DIRECTION>
(pissed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look... I'd do anything to get Holly back. But, if I end up in a box or back in jail, then I really can't help her, can I? What I should do, is take my money and go back to court.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANLEY>
<GINGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Back to court? Back to Melissa's gladiators? You throw a hundred grand at her, she'll throw five back at you. It's not about Holly, it's about beating you. You know that. Think, Stanley.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GINGER>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What I'm thinking about is that you're willing to put a gun to my head to see if I can hack --
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly three club kids come busting into the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ginger interrupts him by slamming Stan between the urinals and ramming her tongue into his mouth with the kind of wet, aggressive action that takes a movie from PG-13 to an R.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When the kids realize that the urinals are occupied, they leave. Slowly Ginger takes her tongue out of Stan's mouth. They look at each other. She smiles at him.
</DIRECTION>
<GINGER>
<DIRECTION>
(coyly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GINGER>
<DIRECTION>
A beat, for a moment there exists something between them, then bam, she's all business again.
</DIRECTION>
<GINGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, let me sum it up for you, Stanley. You live in a trailer.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a felon, working a dead- end job. You want to get Holly back, Gabriel's your only shot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GINGER>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON STANLEY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he realizes she's right, he's got nothing to lose. Slam! He smacks the mirror with his fist, then walks out of the rest room. Ginger slowly lifts the cigarette. She exhales, then slowly smiles. She's got him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. PRAGUE VALET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Next to the valet stand, Gabriel leans over the hood of an evil-looking, bright-yellow Lamborghini Diablo Roadster, a GAMEBOY CHIRPING in his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stanley walks INTO the FRAME. Without missing a beat, Gabriel looks up --
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Big Stan. I was afraid we lost you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel stands up and walks toward Stan.
</DIRECTION>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me what the deal is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANLEY>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go up to the house. I'm having a little get-together. I'll explain it to you there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel smiles.

:SC: INT. FBI LAB - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Three GEEKY COMPUTER-TYPES sit in front of a huge array of CRTs. They look up when Roberts stalks into the room. He yanks off his jacket, crumbles it and throws it across the room. They just look at each other.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me you have some good news for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTS>
<FBI_COMPUTER_GEEK_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually we have a small ray of hope in the vast darkness that is your life, sir. Check this out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FBI_COMPUTER_GEEK_1>
<DIRECTION>
On one of the 25-inch screens we see a terminal at LAX with hundreds of people streaming by at 20x speed. Torvalds is being apprehended. He freezes it.
</DIRECTION>
<FBI_COMPUTER_GEEK_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See these two guys?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FBI_COMPUTER_GEEK_1>
<DIRECTION>
He points at two men watching this action from the sideline. He pulls another monitor forward.
</DIRECTION>
<FBI_COMPUTER_GEEK_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now watch this...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FBI_COMPUTER_GEEK_1>
<DIRECTION>
He fast-forwards through the crowd until the two guys show up again. He freezes it.
</DIRECTION>
<FBI_COMPUTER_GEEK_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Recognize those two, same guys, next day. Question is --
	</DIALOGUE>
</FBI_COMPUTER_GEEK_1>
<DIRECTION>
He slowly moves the action forward --
</DIRECTION>
<FBI_COMPUTER_GEEK_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- who's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FBI_COMPUTER_GEEK_1>
<DIRECTION>
The footage stops and zooms in on one of two travelers who the two men are meeting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is Stanley.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stanley Jobson...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTS>
<DIRECTION>
The computer guys look at each other. One hands Roberts an open copy of Wired magazine.
</DIRECTION>
<FBI_COMPUTER_GEEK_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wired's man of the year, 1996. Pretty much a burnout but he was the hacker zeitgeist of his day --
	</DIALOGUE>
</FBI_COMPUTER_GEEK_1>
<ROBERTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know who Jobson is. I busted him.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Stan's image)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are you in L.A.?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTS>
<DIRECTION>
Roberts looks at it. Then at the screen. A pop-up screen shows Stanley's history.
</DIRECTION>
<FBI_COMPUTER_GEEK_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His ex-wife lives in Malibu.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FBI_COMPUTER_GEEK_1>
<FBI_COMPUTER_GEEK_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The new husband owns Backdoor Films, a shady porn production house in Chatsworth. Decent production value but they only shoot on video. His wife actually starred in a couple of his videos. Apparently she's an 'actress.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</FBI_COMPUTER_GEEK_2>
<DIRECTION>
Roberts moves the mouse to see Ginger.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's the chick?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTS>
<FBI_COMPUTER_GEEK_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We don't know yet, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FBI_COMPUTER_GEEK_1>
<FBI_COMPUTER_GEEK_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Serious piece of talent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FBI_COMPUTER_GEEK_2>
<FBI_COMPUTER_GEEK_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Way outta his league. Something's up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FBI_COMPUTER_GEEK_3>
<FBI_COMPUTER_GEEK_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know he also has a ten-year- old daughter, who he's not supposed to see. Maybe that's why he's here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FBI_COMPUTER_GEEK_2>
<DIRECTION>
Roberts looks at him like he's an idiot.
</DIRECTION>
<FBI_COMPUTER_GEEK_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or maybe not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FBI_COMPUTER_GEEK_2>
<ROBERTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to know who that girl is. Pronto.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTS>
<DIRECTION>
Roberts stands.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And stake out his daughter.

</ROBERTS>

:SC: EXT. GABRIEL'S HOUSE - POOL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The house is at the very top of the hills and the pool hangs off the side of the cliff, way below the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The outer edge appears nonexistent, like the water hangs frozen in air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A very hip but very nasty soiree is in progress. More Ibiza than Hollywood Hills.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stanley sits in a chair beside a pool containing a half- dozen beautiful un-clad model-types.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel is mingling through the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP - STANLEY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stanley stares off into the glittering lights of L.A. WIDEN.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>

(smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So Stan, tell me. How'd you do it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANLEY>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Break the code. At the club. You broke the entire encryption, a silencer against your eye and your cock in someone's mouth, all in less than sixty seconds. How?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I used a logic bomb, dropped it through the trap door --
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANLEY>
<GINGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you didn't. You didn't have time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GINGER>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, you can do better than that. How'd you do it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I used a password sniffer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel glances at Ginger who shakes her head.
</DIRECTION>
<GINGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh uh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GINGER>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I did --
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANLEY>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, Stanley. How'd-you-do-it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know exactly. I see the numbers. In my head. All my life. I don't answer equations, I just see the answers. Same with code. I can't explain ---
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Ginger eases over to where Stan is sitting. She runs her hands across his shoulders as she moves around him, dancing to the MUSIC.
</DIRECTION>
<GINGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mozart always said he didn't write music; he just wrote down what he heard in his head. So did Faulkner, just with words.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GINGER>
<GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
(drinking wine)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You definitely have a gift, Stan. The most powerful people on the planet are like you. With a laptop and a phone line you can make God look like a thirteen-year-old with a stack of Playboys and a lack of imagination.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mere, Stan, let me show you something.

:SC: INT. GABRIEL'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stanley and Gabriel stand in Gabriel's primo designed pad, staring at an array of supercomputers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stanley stands in front of the six huge flat panels, linked together, in complete awe.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pretty impressive, huh.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANLEY>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's the deal. I need a worm, Stanley. A hydra, actually. A multi-headed worm to break an encryption and then sniff out latent digital footprints throughout an encrypted network.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What kind of cypher?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANLEY>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vernam encryption.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A Vernam's impossible. Its key code is destroyed upon implementation. Not to mention being a true 128 bit encryption.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANLEY>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, we're talking 512 bit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's impossible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANLEY>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell ya what, I'll pay you ten million dollars. That should be enough to get your daughter back...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... unless of course it's impossible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Stan thinks about it.
</DIRECTION>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing's impossible.

They shake hands and Gabriel heads toward the back of the house.

Stan looks over to see Ginger staring at him.
</DIRECTION>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Ginger pulls herself up on the desk, spreading her legs on either side of the keyboard.
</DIRECTION>
<GINGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, Stan. Let's get to work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GINGER>
<DIRECTION>
She turns on the computers. He backs away.
</DIRECTION>
<GINGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It won't bite you, I promise.

</GINGER>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. It's gonna be pretty hard without a gun to my head.

She reaches out and pulls him to her.

<DIRECTION>
As she leans back. She stares at him a moment then slides off the desk.
</DIRECTION>
<GINGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a smart guy, Stanley. You figure me out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GINGER>
<DIRECTION>
She hands him the bottle of expensive wine she's been drinking, and then grabbing Stan by the belt-buckle, pulls him casually behind her toward the pool house.
</DIRECTION>

FADE IN:

<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. POOL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lounging by the pool is none other than our heroine, Ginger, topless, wearing nothing more than tiny, oblong, green-tinted shades, a skimpy T-back, and a little silver ring through her left nipple. She's reading Steven Hawkings' A Brief History of Time. A shadow falls over her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shadow moves. Ginger glances nonchalantly up, then:
</DIRECTION>
<GINGER>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you have that just-fucked- the-neighbor's-cat look this morning.

She reaches over, lights a cigarette, and inhales deeply. He smiles, looking her up and down.
</DIRECTION>
<GINGER>

	</DIALOGUE>
</GINGER>
<DIRECTION>
They stare at each sharing a moment of God-only-knows- what, then both break into smiles like two giddy seventh- graders at the local skating rink.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stanley nervously clears his throat. She's got him.
</DIRECTION>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I borrow your car? There's something I need to do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANLEY>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches down beside the chair, grabs her keys and tosses them to him. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<GINGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you're going to see your daughter, you might want to reevaluate the way you look.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(goes back to her book)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a thought.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GINGER>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at her with open mouth amazement. In just 24 hours, she already knows what makes him tick.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks up from her book and winks at him, then returns to her reading.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. NEWTON MONTESSORI SCHOOL - DAY

<DIRECTION>
A SCHOOL BELL RINGS and three hundred screaming kids of all ages come running from the doors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON HOLLY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Not your average ten-year-old. Even decked out in bell- bottoms and sandals there is something about the way she carries herself that is older; wiser; sadder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She walks into a CLOSEUP and scans the driveway. Reflected in her tiny, round lavender shades we see the circular driveway of the school jam-packed with buses and parental types in their M-series Mercedes and their Lexus SUVs. She sighs. We CRANE UP, PANNING LEFT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holly walks to the edge of the street oblivious to the mayhem. She looks up and down the street then slowly drops her backpack and sits down on the curb. She pulls a well-worn copy of William Gibson's Neuromancer from her backpack, and turns up the raging ELECTRONICA from her WALKMAN.

He walks toward Ginger's silver Mercedes CLK which he's borrowing. Holly runs and jumps on his back. They laugh as he carries her to the car.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
Holly quickly kisses him, jumps out and runs, crying, from the car at full speed, with the giraffe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stanley, tears rolling down his face, slaps the steering wheel, trying to figure out how he screwed up his life so badly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the passenger door opens and a man in a DARK BLUE SUIT and fed-issued shades gets in.

Stanley whacks the fed with his elbow across the bridge of his nose and jumps out of the car.

:SC: INT. TAURUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stan runs across the hood of the Taurus and just jumps over the railing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. SHEER CLIFF - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We realize what Stan did probably wasn't the smartest move in the world. The cliff is just barely on this side of 90 degrees and drops off about five hundred yards straight down to the PCH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stan falls in SLOW MOTION about thirty feet before the cliff face angles out enough to break his fall. He begins a combination of sliding and tumbling down the bluff.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. MALIBU HOUSE (STREET) - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Roberts runs to the railing and sees Stanley sliding/ falling down the hill.

Roberts then hops the railing, as his men scramble for the car.

:SC: EXT. SHEER CLIFF - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Roberts hangs in mid-air a moment, then he too begins the rolling fall down the hill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON STANLEY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as he tries to keep his balance, is being beaten and battered by the sharp, rocky ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, he shoots off an outcropping and free-falls for fifteen feet. Then it really gets bad.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clear plastic sheeting has been stretched across the hill to help control the erosion. To Stanley however, it is the world's largest Slip and Slide.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is no longer able to control, even badly, his descent. Now, he is flying down the cliff face, only the rocks and bushes that slam into his body, slows the descent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roberts, above him, is doing little better.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LONG SHOT ON CLIFF FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Stan and Roberts slide toward the eight lanes of blazing afternoon traffic on the PCH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, Stan bounces onto the black-top road. He runs headlong into the traffic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CARS SCREECH, HORNS BLARING, as they slide into each other. Stanley does not lose the single-minded focus of escaping.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roberts, now at the bottom himself, watches as a CAR SLIDES sideways into Stan, flipping him over it. Stan, not stopping to feel the pain, runs across the hood of a freshly-stopped car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. BEACH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the other side, Stan runs down to the beach and runs down the sand at full-tilt, looking for any escape route. Roberts has made up some time due to the auto-pedestrian accident which slowed him down a little. Stan however is faster.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stan does his best Jerry Rice, as he runs down the beach at full speed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the Taurus comes tearing-ass across the beach at Stanley. Stan veers, now running through the surf. The Taurus veers as well, and Stan is forced to slide across the hood to keep from getting whacked. The Taurus breaks left, and slides further into the surf.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The FBI driver hits the accelerator and bogs the Taurus down, tires spinning, throwing sand. Stan continues to run as Roberts makes it to the Taurus.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTS>

He pulls his .40 CAL. from his shoulder holster and FIRES it into the air. Roberts bends over trying to catch his breath.

Stanley stops, putting his hands up.

	Ahh, the great American outdoors. I'll never understand the appeal of fly-fishing, Jim. A little too much like masturbation for me, without the payoff.

</STANLEY>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That I am. And worse. Much worse. I am forced to operate on a different plane than you. But, I have ethics. Rules to which I must adhere. 200 years ago Thomas Jefferson wrote a letter to Madison because he was concerned that the freedoms of the constitution would be ignored.

	I don't understand why the fuck you're telling me this.

Stan inside. It's as if he's just teleported into Beirut. Weapons, Hummers, a huge armored bus is jacked up at one end of the theatre. Gabriel's men go about readying themselves. One of the mercs walks over to Gabriel to show a modified electronic dog collar.

</STANLEY>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyone who infringes on America's freedom. Terrorists' states, Stanley. Someone must take their war to them. They bomb a church, we bomb ten. They hijack a plane, we take out an airport. They execute American tourists, we tactically nuke an entire city. We must make terrorism so horrific that it becomes unthinkable to attack Americans.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm out. I'm not doing this. You're insane.

</STANLEY>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe. I wanted you to do this because you wanted to, because we need men like you, but our time table's been moved up. Just relax and it will all be over in twenty-four hours. You're rich, Stanley. Pretty soon Holly and you will be basking in the sun on the deck of some eighty-foot scarab, eating bon bons and living the good life.

He turns to walk off. Stanley looks around. He spots a generator and moves toward it. Stanley reaches down to the power board on the generator and gives a large dial a twist.

Suddenly, the hundreds of lights in the rack begin to arc. In a shower of GLASS they start EXPLODING from the huge amperage shooting through them from the generator. Gabriel turns to see Stan standing next to the generator. He moves toward him just as the room goes black.

</DIRECTION>

A huge armored bus rolls down the street, through two parked cars, and up onto the sidewalk, effectively sealing off the front of the glass bank. Mercs begin welding metal plates around the armored bus. We hear the approaching SIRENS of a fleet of cop cars.

	You're wrong, Stanley. Some men are put here to shape destiny, to protect freedom, despite the atrocities they must commit. I am one of those men. Thousands die every day for no reason at all, where is your bleeding heart for them? You give your twenty dollars to Greenpeace every year and think you are changing the world. What countries will harbor terrorists, when they realize the consequences of what I will do? Did you know I can buy nuclear warheads in Minsk for forty million each?
