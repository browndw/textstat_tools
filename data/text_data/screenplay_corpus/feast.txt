Bearded Cameraman jumps to pull Fuzzy from the breach.

Fuzzy's body is YANKED into the hole. The group tumbles forward.

<DIRECTION>
Mean Green tries to stop herself from sliding, but can't.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One by one, the hippies are being dragged to their death.

Ripping, tearing, and howling echoes off the walls.

Bearded Cameraman stumbles back. Mean Green spots him.

<DIRECTION>
Bearded Camerman just stares at her in shock. He's missing both his arms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mean Green lunges and grabs Chief's dropped pick-axe. She HAMMERS at the chain around her waist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Foot by foot, she's dragged closer. At the last second, she BREAKS the chain, popping herself free.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She spins, running for safety. A guttural HOWL behind her fills the cavern. Mean Green sprints toward the cave opening. She's gonna make it. Only a few more feet. And then... JERK!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Something grabs her neck and YANKS her back into the darkness. The whiplash sends her bloody BULLHORN flying into the light. As it lands, it lets out one last weak HONK...

<DIRECTION>
Adulterer holds a shattered PICTURE of his wife and two kids.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sighs and puts it down.

	I'm sorry... I'm so sorry...

EXT. IGA (GROCERY STORE) -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sun shines bright in the cloudless sky. There is a stiff wind that stirs up the dust. Bartender's car slowly lurches up the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BARTENDER'S CAR -- CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heroine and Tuffy skeptically look at the surroundings.
</DIRECTION>
<HEROINE>

	It's right up there, in the back of the store.

</HEROINE>

EXT. IGA (GROCERY STORE) -- CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car pulls up in the back of the store and stops. They get out, looking around. Tuffy holds a machete. Adulterer kneels against his car.
</DIRECTION>
<HEROINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is everyone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEROINE>
<ADULTERER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know, I just got here. Did you find your girl?

<HEROINE>

</HEROINE>
<TUFFY>

Adulterer shakes his head, acknowledging their death.
</DIRECTION>
<TUFFY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TUFFY>
<DIRECTION>
Adulterer sheepishly nods.
</DIRECTION>
<HEROINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This place is a ghost town.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEROINE>
<DIRECTION>
The group makes their way to the store front, peeking beyond the glass doors.
</DIRECTION>
<ADULTERER>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADULTERER>
<DIRECTION>
In the distance, in middle of a dusty parking lot, CHARLIE stands staring at them.
</DIRECTION>
<HEROINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Charlie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEROINE>
<DIRECTION>
Heroine runs to her and the others follow. Charlie fidgets awkwardly. She cries and blood stains her dress.
</DIRECTION>
<HEROINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Charlie!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEROINE>
<DIRECTION>
As Heroine nears, Adulterer GRABS her arm.
</DIRECTION>
<ADULTERER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop! There's something wrong!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADULTERER>
<HEROINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honey!?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEROINE>
<DIRECTION>
The group eyes Charlie, noticing Heroine's locket around her ankle, leading to a slightly ajar manhole cover. Suddenly, the sunlight starts to FADE. They look up the sun.
</DIRECTION>
<TUFFY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh god.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TUFFY>
<DIRECTION>
The MOON moves in front of it -- a SOLAR ECLIPSE. Beast HISSING and FLUTTERING is heard. Heroine looks from left to right, panic stricken.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mommy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
The sunlight is fading. The manhole cover shakes, something is holding Charlie in place. Heroine lurches forward, but Adulterer holds her at bay.
</DIRECTION>
<ADULTERER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a trap!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADULTERER>
<DIRECTION>
At a standstill, the group looks around for options. In the distance, the darkness of the eclipse rolls towards them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adulterer reacts, grabbing Tuffy's machete and lunging for Charlie. The strike cuts the chain at her ankle. The manhole cover POPS off and a Beast claw sinks into Adulterer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The darkness covers the manhole. Momma Beast rises, hoisting Adulterer's blood dripping body from the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<ADULTERER>
<DIRECTION>
(gurgling blood)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Run!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADULTERER>
<DIRECTION>
Heroine scoops up her child, moving away from Momma Beast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tuffy grabs them both, leading them back towards the store front. As Adulterer's blood flows, Momma Beast drags him towards her main prey.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A blanket of darkness leads Momma Beast, overtaking the survivors. At the store front, Heroine pulls Charlie close.
</DIRECTION>
<HEROINE>
<DIRECTION>
(a whisper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you...

CUT TO BLACK:

EXT. IGA (GROCERY STORE) -- AN HOUR LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A string of ten WHITE VANS come to a halt in the dusty parking lot. THE MAN IN TAN (45, buzz cut, leathery skin, cool) steps from the lead van and surveys the ravaged small town.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A swarm of men emerge from the other vehicles, all dressed alike in work boots, gas masks and coveralls. They go into action honing in on rubble with SENSORS and COUNTERS.
</DIRECTION>

	</DIALOGUE>
</COMPANY_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
The Man in Tan moves to a few men standing over a pool of blood and guts. Using the sensor equipment, the COMPANY MAN follows the blood trail that enters the grocery store.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. IGA (GROCERY STORE) -- CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The place is torn to hell. Dust and soot hangs in the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The men instinctively raise their high-powered rifles, letting the flashlights on the ends lead the way. They follow the trail of blood to a back FREEZER LOCKER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's scratched, bashed and thrashed.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_MAN_IN_TAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Open it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_MAN_IN_TAN>
<DIRECTION>
Company Man #2 steps forward and uses a metal-cutting chainsaw to cut through the hinges. The door falls with a THUD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the dust clears, Tuffy, Heroine and Charlie stare back at the men, huddled together in a defensive stance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Man in Tan creaks his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_MAN_IN_TAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gentlemen, help them to safety.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_MAN_IN_TAN>
<DIRECTION>
Heroine, holding Charlie, lurches back.
</DIRECTION>
<HEROINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not safe, she's still alive, she'll be back...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEROINE>
<THE_MAN_IN_TAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Relax. We know. We're the calvary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_MAN_IN_TAN>
<DIRECTION>
The Man in Tan steps forward, guiding the group out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. IGA (GROCERY STORE) -- MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bulky security truck pulls up. A DRIVER, holding a bloody rag to his nose, gets out and moves to the back door.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_MAN_IN_TAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_MAN_IN_TAN>
<DIRECTION>
The Driver nods to the back of the truck, opening the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bozo lurches out, handcuffed and chained.
</DIRECTION>
<BOZO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get these cuffs off me! I'm a goddamn hero for Christ's sake!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOZO>
<DIRECTION>
A shirtless, irate BOZO sits next to Grandpa and Grandma in the back. He settles at the sight of the others.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANDMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	G'morning.

</GRANDMA>
<BOZO>
	<DIALOGUE>

Heroine covers her daughter's ears as the survivors are helped into the truck. Tuffy sits, looking to Bozo.
</DIRECTION>
<TUFFY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How'd you survive?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TUFFY>
<BOZO>
	<DIALOGUE>

Heroine, last in the truck, turns to the men.
</DIRECTION>
<HEROINE>
	<DIALOGUE>

</HEROINE>
<THE_MAN_IN_TAN>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
(off Heroine's pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're in good hands now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_MAN_IN_TAN>
<DIRECTION>
The door shuts on Heroine's concerned face. The Man in Tan locks eyes with the Driver.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_MAN_IN_TAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do it quick and spread the mess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_MAN_IN_TAN>
<DIRECTION>
The Driver nods back. Sinister implication understood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Man in Tan lights a cigarette as he watches the truck drive off. The truck's logo reads, "FARM-AID." He inhales.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Freeze on him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NAME: THE MAN IN TAN. AGE: 45. OCCUPATION: HE CAN'T TELL YOU. PURPOSE: TO LAY GROUNDWORK FOR SEQUEL. LIFE EXPECTANCY: PRETTY F-ING GOOD.
