INT. VICTORIAN ESTATE - 1895 - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP: Ornate antique GRANDFATHER CLOCK strikes 2:15.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The credits begin to roll.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Calligraphy place cards are painstakingly hand-written in preparation for a formal reception.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Servants meticulously clean an elaborate crystal chandelier.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hands rapidly shine silver cutlery.

<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kitchen clock strikes 2:15.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Poultry plucked. Feathers everywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Steaming copper pots boiling over. Platters prepared with decorative garnish.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Extravagant tiered cake is lavishly iced. A glob of frosting enters a pair of puckered lips. The perpetrator, a fey, pompous, HEAD VALET, seriously considers the texture and flavor of the icing, then gives the PASTRY CHEF a withering, sour look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The valet, oblivious to the chef's fury, gathers a prepared silver breakfast tray and checks his pocket watch. 2:15.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEDROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Antique bedside table clock -- just past 2:15. The valet throws open velvet drapes, sunlight FLOODS the room revealing a figure sleeping soundly in a massive oak framed bed. The valet puts down the tray, pulls back the quilt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dozing figure gives the valet a deliberate, angry KICK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flinching infinitesimally, the valet crosses to the closet, selects three suits and holds them up for inspection. From beneath the puffiest of pillows, AN EYE reluctantly opens. A weary arm points decisively to the riding outfit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ESTATE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The riding outfit is adorned by LEOPOLD, Duke of Albany, a dashing, virile man in his 30's. GALLOPING with great abandon, he expertly leads his horse up hills and over hedges. He sends gardeners shaping the grounds fleeing from his path.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the background, lanterns are being strung throughout the estate. Rugs are beaten out of open windows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Large hallway clock -- 6:15. A pair of boots track a freshly scrubbed floor as Leopold heads carelessly up the stairway. Three steps behind, the valet snaps his fingers signaling the staff to clean up the mess.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SERIES OF CLOSE UPS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gaudily framed portraits of somber relations.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bird sits listless in a gilded cage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hot water is poured into a bath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carriages begin to arrive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Orchestra leader signals the musicians to play.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Guests fill the ballroom in formal attire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leopold stares haughtily into a full length mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He wears only dotted linen drawers and a black silk top hat of the period. He flexes slightly. The valet hastily fastens a corset around his mid-section from behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leopold eyes his reflection seductively. He becomes bored.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns to his right. The valet spoons sorbet from a silver saucer into his mouth. He turns back to the mirror to watch himself eat. The valet pats his mouth dry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He affects a pampered STRUT, crossing the room as the valet sprays a mixture of perfume and powder into the air. Leopold thrusts out his arms walking through the mist, turns and saunters back to his favorite place, in front of the mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, as if weighing a great decision, Leopold hands his hat to his valet and nods firmly into the mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fine linen undervest slides over his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Black twilled worsted trousers pulled up to his waist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The buttoning of his hard, white, roll collar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A cream suede glove stitched in black slides over his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A perfect tight bow tie is tied around his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An elegant black tuxedo jacket with silk facings and tails to the knees is fitted to his torso.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His hair is sleeked with oil and centrally parted.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His eyebrows are brushed with a tiny silver comb.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His cheeks are pinched.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A red silk handkerchief is placed in the bosom of his lapel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leopold stares into the mirror. The effect is DAZZLING. He raises one eyebrow. Then, in a voice you could pour over a waffle:
</DIRECTION>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You dance like a herd of cattle, Miss Fairchild. You are a rare woman who lights up the room... simply by leaving it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<DIRECTION>
He bows. As he rises, the reflection of Leopold's UNCLE OTTO, a pampered, effectual man in his 60's, appears behind Leopold in the looking glass.
</DIRECTION>
<UNCLE_OTTO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me Leopold, do you plan to join us downstairs after completing this one-sided flash of wit?
	</DIALOGUE>
</UNCLE_OTTO>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I despise affairs of this sort, Uncle Otto. No one really listens to anyone else. If you attempt it, you will see why.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<UNCLE_OTTO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You judge everything too severely. I wonder what would happen if you were to cast that critical eye inward?
	</DIALOGUE>
</UNCLE_OTTO>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You do not wonder at all. You merely ask in order to state your own opinion.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<UNCLE_OTTO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We are all concerned about you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</UNCLE_OTTO>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ahh, here it comes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<UNCLE_OTTO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your life does not seem to have any direction. At the age of 25 a man is too young to do anything well. At 35 he is too old. Now is your time to take action. Tell me, what is it you want to DO with your life?
	</DIALOGUE>
</UNCLE_OTTO>
<LEOPOLD>
<DIRECTION>
(wearily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do not know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<UNCLE_OTTO>
<DIRECTION>
(just as weary)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your ignorance cramps my conversation.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he slaps Leopold's
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	face twice rather
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
quickly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wake up! This is your one and only life. Every man has the chance to make a difference. DO something!
	</DIALOGUE>
</UNCLE_OTTO>
<DIRECTION>
Leopold, stung, takes a moment to compose himself.
</DIRECTION>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am most grateful for your surveillance and for your sympathy. I assure you there is no need for concern. I am as effectual and attentive... as my position allows.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<UNCLE_OTTO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Life is not position, Leopold. It is action.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he straightens Leopold's tie)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will see you downstairs promptly. In the appropriate frame of mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</UNCLE_OTTO>
<DIRECTION>
He leaves. Leopold stares into the mirror, snaps his fingers. The valet hands him a glass and pours a small shot of brandy. Leopold shoots him a look. The valet fills the glass higher.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leopold drains the glass and heads to the doorway. He hesitates, taking a deep breath and a long pause. Finally...
</DIRECTION>
<THE_VALET>
<DIRECTION>
(grandly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go spread joy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_VALET>
<DIRECTION>
Without looking back, Leopold leaves the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Music fills the air as the creme de la creme of Victorian society gather inside. Leopold holds a prearranged dance card. He looks at the names and finds his first partner is MISS TREE. Leopold looks upward helplessly at an unrelenting God.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BALLROOM DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A profoundly self-conscious Leopold dances energetically into frame with MISS TREE, an ancient, elfin, yet amazingly SPRY woman who gapes up at him searchingly, unblinking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leopold opens his mouth to speak, can think of nothing suitable to say, and clamps his mouth shut. They dance out of frame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BALLROOM DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leopold dances into frame with CLARA, a BEAUTIFUL girl of 19. He glances at her and smiles. She titters, turning away shyly. They whirl around the dance floor. His smile grows into a broad grin. Caught up in the excitement, Clara beams up at him... happily revealing a mouth full of missing, inky teeth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leopold, face frozen in a formal smile, dances on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BALLROOM DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leopold lumbers into frame with MISS FAIRCHILD, a woman of immense girth. With great dignity and extreme difficulty he maneuvers her around the floor, looking everywhere except her enormous bosom.
</DIRECTION>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You dance like an angel, Miss Fairchild. You light up the room. I thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<DIRECTION>
Miss Fairchild curtseys heavily. Leopold glances at his card, sees the name Miss Serena Clacket and shudders.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He spots a VERY LOVELY WOMAN hidden amongst the guests. She scribbles in a small note pad, occasionally glancing around. Hiding his dance card, he saunters over.
</DIRECTION>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good evening. I do not believe I have had the pleasure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<DIRECTION>
The young woman stares vacantly at Leopold until she realizes he is addressing her. She puts her pad away.
</DIRECTION>
<CARLSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Julia Carlson.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLSON>
<DIRECTION>
Leopold takes her hand and kisses it gently.
</DIRECTION>
<CARLSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. Will you excuse me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLSON>
<LEOPOLD>
<DIRECTION>
(slightly tipsy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are not from the area, are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<CARLSON>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles and shakes her head "No")
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLSON>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is my estate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<CARLSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looking around the room)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well it's not home but it's much...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLSON>
<DIRECTION>
Leopold regards her curiously. The orchestra starts up. There is a hubbub amongst the guests.
</DIRECTION>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shocking! The TA-RA-RA-BOOM-DE-AY.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<CARLSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The? Oh, that's from Paris, isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLSON>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is a scandal nonetheless.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<DIRECTION>
Leopold spots Uncle Otto observing him from across the room.
</DIRECTION>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miss Carlson, do me the honor?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<CARLSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLSON>
<LEOPOLD>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling seductively)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Truly I would be in your debt. Any admonition would be erased simply by presenting a partner as lovely as yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<CARLSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no. Really, I...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLSON>
<DIRECTION>
Leopold stiffly holds out his arm. A beat. Carlson, stuck, takes it WITH HESITATION and is escorted to the dance floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They dance. ALL but Leopold and Carlson gaily sing "TA-RA-RA- BOOM-DE-AY." Leopold, flushed, looks quite smitten. Carlson, shy at first, eventually smiles brightly.
</DIRECTION>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I suppose we really ought to sing along.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<CARLSON>
<DIRECTION>
(embarrassed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, golly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLSON>
<DIRECTION>
They half sing, half speak the TA-RA-RA-BOOM-DE-AY, their emphasis on "BOOM." Laughing giddily, their dancing becomes freer, picking up speed. The room SPINS. Finally:
</DIRECTION>
<CARLSON>
<DIRECTION>
(breathless)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you for the dance. It was lovely. I hope it wasn't too awful for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLSON>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not at all. It was most enlightening.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<DIRECTION>
There is a slight pause. The Grandfather CLOCK strikes midnight.
</DIRECTION>
<CARLSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I really must be going.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLSON>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I won't hear of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<CARLSON>
<DIRECTION>
(moving away from him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I'm quite late as it is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLSON>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I shall see you to the door...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<CARLSON>
<DIRECTION>
(stopping him resolutely)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're very sweet. I had a wonderful time.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she watches him,
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	memorizing his face.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Then firmly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goodbye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLSON>
<DIRECTION>
Leopold takes a glass of champagne from a passing waiter. He watches Carlson pass through the crowd and out the courtyard door. He surveys the room. After a moment he follows her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GARDEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leopold makes his way through the manicured garden in the dark. He hears an EERIE METALLIC SOUND. He slows down, brushes back the thicket. The silhouette of a woman is revealed. She is once again writing in her notebook.
</DIRECTION>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miss Carlson?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<DIRECTION>
Carlson spins around quickly, panicked. Leopold STOPS. Partially hidden in the brush, a sleek, oddly shaped, MECHANICAL device. It's door open, lit from within, casting a weird glow.
</DIRECTION>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good God...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<CARLSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you...? You frightened me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLSON>
<DIRECTION>
Leopold moves toward the contraption and is about to touch it...
</DIRECTION>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What sort of mechanism is this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<DIRECTION>
Carlson shakes her head, unsure of how to proceed.
</DIRECTION>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Answer me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<CARLSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's perfectly all right. It's...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLSON>
<DIRECTION>
Leopold carefully examines the apparatus, stepping inside. Carlson FREEZES.
</DIRECTION>
<CARLSON>
<DIRECTION>
(carefully, deliberately)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen to me. Please. Move very slowly. Step out of the machine. Step out and I'll explain whatever you want to know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLSON>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is this? Who are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<DIRECTION>
His hand comes to rest on a glowing red lever.
</DIRECTION>
<CARLSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLSON>
<DIRECTION>
She YANKS on his arm. Instinctively he pulls away, accidentally thrusting the lever into action. Carlson falls from the machine.
</DIRECTION>
<CARLSON>
<DIRECTION>
(suddenly frantic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get out of there! Get out now!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLSON>
<DIRECTION>
The machine LIGHTS UP.
</DIRECTION>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miss Carlson... I...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<CARLSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLSON>
<DIRECTION>
The compartment door snaps shut.
</DIRECTION>
<CARLSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLSON>
<DIRECTION>
There is a BRIGHT WHITE FLASH. Blackness fills the screen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. N.Y.C. LABORATORY - 1995 DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The compartment door slides OPEN revealing DR. KAU, 30's, an Asian doctor with a THICK BROOKLYN ACCENT. Her face full of enthusiasm drops as she sees the unconscious Leopold.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_KAU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_KAU>
<DIRECTION>
She turns to her co-workers, warning them.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_KAU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_KAU>
<DIRECTION>
She looks back at Leopold.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_KAU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_KAU>
<DIRECTION>
Her co-workers, DR. PLODDER, austere, authoritative, DR. DRAKE, muddled and timid, peer inside the compartment door.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_DRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good God!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_DRAKE>
<DR_PLODDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everybody stay calm... Lock the front door.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_PLODDER>
<DIRECTION>
Dr. Drake and Kau make a move to inspect an unconscious Leopold.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_PLODDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no, no. You mustn't touch him. The consequences could be catastrophic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_PLODDER>
<DR_KAU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He could be hurt, or even dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_KAU>
<DR_PLODDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...All right. Touch him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_PLODDER>
<DIRECTION>
They approach Leopold. Dr. Kau finds Carlson's note pad on the ground next to Leopold. She reads the last entry.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_KAU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...But I'm stuck and it's only a dance and he IS the seventh Duke of Albany...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_KAU>
<DIRECTION>
They all look at one another, then back at Leopold.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_DRAKE>

	Carlson...!

INT. LAB - KATE'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KATHERINE COLES, a radiant workaholic, types frenetically into the computer while talking on the phone, trying hard not to sound upset.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's upset? People fall in love, they have to climb back out.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she laughs but she is not smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, what? We'll just be friends now, Right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
She stops typing and listens for a while. She runs her hand through her hair.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see. Well I appreciate your honesty.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(using her middle
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I'll just think of this as surviving another dating accident. Take care or good luck or whatever I'm supposed to...

</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
The line goes dead.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...say... Goodbye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Dr. Plodder bursts in. Kate sees his distress and instantly becomes very centered.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_PLODDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_PLODDER>
<KATE>

	...of Albany. He was the... IS the son of Emery and Eliza. He was of no actual importance until he vanished at the turn of the century without a trace. It was a sensation. In the 30's they even made a movie about him. "The Tenuous Duke" with Ronald Coleman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DR_DRAKE>

(absently)

	<DIALOGUE>
	I love Ronald Coleman.

	Despite much speculation and a nation wide investigation, a body was never found. He was never heard from again.

</KATE>
<DR_KAU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Until now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_KAU>
<DIRECTION>
There is a stunned silence. They stare at Leopold in awe.

<DR_DRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've altered the course of history.

<DR_KAU>

	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_PLODDER>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Think. Just, think. Rationally. Now, no one would believe such a stupid mistake could be made because no one would believe any of this is possible. So. We fix this. We keep this to ourselves and we fix it. Fast.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
They all nod in agreement.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Kau, research all our data. 1st priority: Locate Carlson. Drake, determine the reciprocal correlation's connected to the 19th century. Work 24 hours a day if necessary. In the meantime... one of us will have to take charge of him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
She forces back panic. Only the tremor in her voice gives her away.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is a major scientific opportunity. It doesn't get any better than this. Imagine. Researching the behavior, the physical and emotional characteristics of a century ago! Utilizing technology available to us today... He's a gold mine!

<DR_PLODDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's a man, Kate. Not a guinea pig.

</DR_PLODDER>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And while he's here, he's ours. Any volunteers?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
No one moves.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_DRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll draw names. Whoever is is picked will be responsible. Agreed?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_DRAKE>
<DIRECTION>
They nod reluctantly. Drake writes out names and throws them in a cup. The silence becomes deafening. Finally:
</DIRECTION>
<DR_KAU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_KAU>
<DIRECTION>
All the scientists face her.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll look after him?

<DR_KAU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I meant I'll pick the name.

	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<DIRECTION>
The doctors, caught off guard, SMILE BENIGNLY. They surround Leopold as a group, not knowing where to begin. Finally:
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your Grace... Um... Hello... Weee aaare a smaaall part of a laaarge research team. A project funded by the government of the United States.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>
<DIRECTION>
(regarding their
</DIRECTION>

	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
distaste)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Americans. I see...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, um... For the past six and a half years we've been conducting scientific experiments on density and flexibility in the dimensions of time and space.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DR_DRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, uh... Quite by accident we came upon a formula utilizing Tachyons... particles traveling faster than the speed of light, which allowed us to... fold time so to speak.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_DRAKE>
<DR_PLODDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Bend it between the cracks of the dimensions.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_PLODDER>
<DR_KAU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_KAU>
<DIRECTION>
They all laugh nervously. Leopold does not.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_DRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, while that wasn't the original purpose of our experiment, we opted to pursue it, well, privately, on our own.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_DRAKE>
<DR_KAU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Borrowing funds already provided.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_KAU>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We journeyed to your time because it was the quickest path to follow. We debated long and hard whether we should use this knowledge at all. Believe me, it was never our intent to disturb the past...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DR_DRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Merely to discover if the expedition were possible. As your presence here confirms... we are very disturbed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_DRAKE>
<DIRECTION>
Leopold nods at them as if they are insane.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_PLODDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The problem facing us is not only HOW to get you back, but WHEN, you see?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_PLODDER>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We certainly don't want to miscalculate. Send you to a different era entirely.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Leopold starts to speak.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_PLODDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rest assured, no harm will come to you. You'll be well looked after by Dr. Coles.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_PLODDER>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Coles...? I do not follow. What do you mean, get me back home?... Where am I?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<DIRECTION>
Awkward pause. Leopold looks carefully around the room for the first time: modern mechanical equipment, data shifting and changing, giant cooling devices, bright neon lighting. The doctors are silent.
</DIRECTION>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Answer me!...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(slowly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you have me believe... I am being detained, at present in the HEREAFTER?... The time to come?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<DR_PLODDER>
<DIRECTION>
(carefully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is the year nineteen hundred and ninety-five.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_PLODDER>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...19...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<DIRECTION>
Leopold leaps up. The doctors follow him around the room.
</DIRECTION>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're insane! All of you! This is impossible!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<DR_PLODDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leopold, calm down!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_PLODDER>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A voyage through time! What do you take me for? Did you bring me here by force?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<DR_DRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're scientist, not seditionists.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_DRAKE>
<LEOPOLD>
<DIRECTION>
(truly panicked)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me out of here! I won't stand for this another moment!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<DIRECTION>
He's out the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UNDERGROUND HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leopold moves quickly, fearfully through the darkly lit hallway, the doctors close behind.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leopold, wait!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DR_KAU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't know what you're doing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_KAU>
<DR_PLODDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just listen to what we have to say!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_PLODDER>
<DIRECTION>
It is too late. Leopold throws open the door and runs upstairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blinding sunlight. Skyscrapers. Automobiles. Traffic lights. Road construction. Modern day pedestrians. Helicopters. Car alarms. Leopold stands frozen, overwhelmed, taking it all in.
</DIRECTION>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	19...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<DIRECTION>
The doctors reach him. He collapses to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate and Dr. Kau talk quietly. Leopold, tightly holding onto his seat and the back door, gazes out the window in utter disbelief.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Squab.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DR_KAU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Squab?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_KAU>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I remember reading they ate a lot of squab.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DR_KAU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Squab... Do you have a squab?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_KAU>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly. On the verge of panic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DR_KAU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pull yourself together!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turning to Leopold)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you all right back there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_KAU>
<DIRECTION>
Leopold, trembling, gapes at the sights, every day sounds, magnified. Perspiration runs down the side of his face. Kate watches him in her rear view mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're going to be fine you know. There's nothing to worry about. I have everything under control.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Dr. Kau stares at Kate in concerned silence.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly to Dr. Kau)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll never get away with this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leopold awakens alone in his room. He sits up with a jolt. His stomach sinks as he realizes THIS IS NO DREAM. He slowly rises to his full stature, moving to the window he looks out on the modern day city, shaking his head in awe. He makes his way to the bedroom door and tentatively touches the knob.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a KNOCK on the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leopold JUMPS back and runs to the bed: The picture of dignity.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How are you feeling?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(no response)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you might like some tea.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I insist on being returned home immediately.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I understand. We're doing our best.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wish to speak with your employer, Dr. Coles.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're speaking to him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are not suggesting that you are Dr. Coles?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miss... uh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Coles. If you like, you could call me Miss Dr. Coles or if that's too much, how about just plain Kate?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>
<DIRECTION>
(coldly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A WOMAN of science?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hard to believe?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But a woman's brain cannot obtain enough knowledge to posses a truly scientific mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(jotting this down)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Interesting. Nevertheless, we've come a long way baby.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>
<DIRECTION>
(confused)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you attempting to be humorous?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm attempting to be informative it's just coming out humorous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Leopold regards her dubiously.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(clinically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, modern social science clearly states that a woman's place in society marks the level of that civilization. A science career for a woman is now almost as acceptable as being a... a... waitress. Cream and sugar?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Young lady, I... Surely it is not expected that I remain here with you indefinitely... Unchaperoned?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(pen poised)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does that make you nervous?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Certainly not!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(writing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then what are you getting so red about? It's a very large apartment... with locks on all the doors.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The idea! My dear Miss Coles...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Coles.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honey...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(she puts the pad down)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's get one thing straight right now. My name is Kate or Katherine or if you insist Dr. Coles.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she rises)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take a good long look, Leopold. I am a 20th century American woman with a Doctorate and a commission and independence. I am not your "young lady" or your "pretty Miss" or your "honey." Is that clear?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Leopold watches her with great interest. Finally:
</DIRECTION>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honey... For the tea.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I'll get it for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Kate grabs the teacup grandly and leaves the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate rummages through every drawer, shelf and cupboard searching for the honey. Finally, she spots the honeybear and squeezes honey A TAD TO VIOLENTLY into the tea. She tries posing "confidently" then checks her reflection in the toaster.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEDROOM - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate returns "confidently" with the tea and a plastic smile.
</DIRECTION>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you... Has it been decided what it is I am to do while I am being held here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, just some laundry, the cooking, a little light housework...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Leopold doesn't react.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(clearing her throat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I took the liberty of preparing a simple schedule to efficiently utilize your time while incorporating you into my routine.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she hands him a schedule)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As you can see, my day begins with meditation and yoga from 6:30 to 7:00.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
She moves in close to him, making Leopold uncomfortable.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	YOU will arise at 6:45, shower and change and at 7:15, we breakfast together. 7:45 we begin the days work. At 10:45 Dr. Kau arrives to observe you in your natural routine as I research the data that will enable you to return home. At 1:15 we lunch together. 2:15 you answer a daily questionnaire, I type up my notes. At precisely 6:15 you will enjoy 15 minutes of FREE TIME, then, at 6:30, I listen to Tom Brokaw while making dinner as YOU write down any questions that come up during your day. At 7:00, we dine together. If you need me at any time you may ring this bell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
She rings a tiny dinner bell. He is about to speak.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, Mondays and Wednesdays I have computer science class, Tuesdays I have therapy. IF I have a date, I'm usually home by 9:15. During these periods you may read any of the books I've picked out for you in your room. I organize my next days work at 10:30, 11:35, David Letterman, 12:40 I'm in bed.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she takes a breath, smiles at him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Next day we begin again. Simple?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>
<DIRECTION>
(after a beat, with great dignity)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...At what time shall I WEE and POOH?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<DIRECTION>
Kate is forced into a stunned silence.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kate? I'm home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE_S_VOICE>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Yes. Our chaperone is here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>

</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sort of. My brother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Visiting?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For the past two years. Charlie can never know about this project. We'll tell him you are a... overly distinguished colleague staying here as our guest. From Canada. Which would explain your lack of familiarity with our customs and so forth
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>
<DIRECTION>
(aghast)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A CANADIAN?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Make yourself comfortable. I'll check in on you later. I think this is going very well, don't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Leopold looks at her blankly.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. If you need anything, just ring.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Kate tinkles the bell, fumbles for the knob and heads out. P.O.V. still on Leopold.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (shouting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Charlie!

Leopold reacts.

<DIRECTION>
(still shouting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come here I wanna talk to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Leopold listens at the door. He slowly opens it, takes two steps out, peers around the corner, then quickly steps back in. He takes a DEEP FRIGHTENED BREATH and slowly deflates.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHARLIE'S STUDIO - MORNING

Charlie sits on the couch smoking a cigarette surrounded by his paintings. He is a likable twentysomething with a big mouth.

	Butter me up.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leopold PEEKS around the entrance to the living room. Confident it's unoccupied, he majestically walks inside: Up to date gadgetry, Charlie's modern art work, bright fashionable furniture. Leopold recoils. His eyes come to rest on the television set. The ON OFF buttons loom large. He looks around the room then brazenly presses the button ON.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Instantly, REGIS and KATHY LEE loudly berate each other before an excited crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leopold jumps back several feet, hands flailing in front of him as if shooing away a bee. He quickly, yet cautiously, slams the power OFF.
</DIRECTION>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Horrible!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<DIRECTION>
He quickly scurries out the hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stops abruptly. He remains very still. Composing himself, he turns and deliberately faces the room. After a moment, he purposefully steps back inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He makes a large ARC around the television set, is confronted by one of Charlie's sculptures and makes an ARC around that. He finds himself in front of a light switch and gingerly examines it. As he does, track lighting ILLUMINATES the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at the lights then back at the switch. He flicks the lights ON and OFF, trying to figure out the precise moment in the transfer of power, laughing in spite of himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate and Charlie enter. They watch Leopold flicking the lights, laughing like a madman. Charlie gives Kate a look.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(explaining)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's from Canada...

</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leopold sits at the head of the table, Kate and Charlie banished to either side. Leopold chews his dinner incessantly.
</DIRECTION>
<LEOPOLD>
<DIRECTION>
(finally)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is this?

</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's called Hamburger Helper.

</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is beyond help. Please serve the next course.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<DIRECTION>
He pushes his plate away.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm afraid there is no next course. If you make a list of the foods you like, I'll pick them up at the store for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is all food here this... textured?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mine's good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please understand, I am used to a different sort of preparation. Where I come from a proper meal is the result of reflection and study. A recipe is merely a theme which an intelligent cook can plan each time with variation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie gives Kate a look.
</DIRECTION>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Several courses are served. Menus are often prepared days in advance, timed to perfection. It is said, without the culinary art, the crudeness of reality would make life unbearable.

</CHARLIE>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Charlie, don't start. I haven't been this angry at you since you got me into that pyramid thing last year. If you make a wisecrack I'm going to burst into flame.

	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've something to say. To the both of you. I... Nothing is what it seems. After witnessing mere weeks of this age it is painfully apparent I am outside of my acquaintance... I don't know how to proceed. I frankly... am in need of assistance. I'm sorry. I'm not very good at this. In the event you have missed it, I am apologizing.

</DIRECTION>
<KATE>

They look at each other just a second too long.

	Leopold?... I don't have a clear handle on this. Perhaps I was wrong keeping you confined to the apartment all this time. I don't know when you'll be able return home... Tomorrow I'll start preparing you for the outside world. And... We'll find your way back. I promise.

<LEOPOLD>

	Oh! I beg your pardon. I, I, I, was merely... I didn't...

</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is there something you want, Leopold?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>

Kate and Leopold walk down the street, a bag in each arm. Leopold eyes Kate suspiciously.
</DIRECTION>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Coles, why is it you are not married?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Women are longer defined by the men they're married to, Leopold. I have a career. I haven't found a man who fits in with that yet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yet people still marry?

<KATE>

They continue to walk, Leopold noticeably studies Kate. Finally:
</DIRECTION>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I suspect there is something wrong with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's nothing wrong with me!

</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps it is the way you present yourself.

</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know what you're talking about.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is some sort of problem when a woman reaches thirty and insists on remaining single.

	You think I'm THIRTY?!

<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do I look THIRTY to you?

</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was an arbitrary number.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You chose it specifically opposed to a lower number.

</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>

	I didn't mean it.

</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>

<DIRECTION>
Leopold spots a formal dress in a store window. He takes a good long look at Kate, smiles, then quickly walks inside. Kate continues down the block.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And it's not that I insist on remaining single. Believe me. Everyone dreams of finding somebody to share their life with. To give someone all the love they've been hoarding since they were a kid. I'm no different. But one has to be sensible. I have a career and a life that's filled with...

She looks around. Leopold is gone.

<KATE>

From behind the dressing room door, Kate shouts to the others with irritation.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is ridiculous. I don't have time to...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she shrieks)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know what this dress costs? Let's get this over with. I'm coming out. Nobody laugh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Kate leaves the dressing room in a huff COMPLETELY UNAWARE that she is STUNNING.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Satisfied?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Leopold and the saleslady stare at her with pleasure.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
She turns and looks at herself in the mirror. Leopold stands behind her, pulls back her hair, brushes away her bangs.
</DIRECTION>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have a lovely face.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<DIRECTION>
Even Kate cannot deny that she is lovely. She stares at herself for a long while.
</DIRECTION>
<LEOPOLD>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll take the dress.

INT. LIVING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate sits Leopold down on the sofa. She turns on the TV and hands him the remote control.
</DIRECTION>
<LEOPOLD>

	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The drug of the 20th century.

He does not move a muscle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate and Leopold sit on the sofa eating their dinner and watching TV. On the screen, a Looney Tune. Leopold enjoys this especially. Kate reaches for the remote but Leopold grabs it territorially, refusing to relinquish it.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(making notes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a guy thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leopold asleep on the sofa still clutching the remote control. Kate comes in with a blanket and settles it over Leopold. She glances around the room, then slowly bends down close to capture a better look at his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a moment she catches herself, takes herself in hand and sits down at her computer. She opens her notes and types. Her fingers slow down to a crawl and come to a stop. She looks up at Leopold lost in thought. She smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reaching for a soda, she accidentally knocks a picture to the floor. In a SMASHED frame, Kate and CARLSON drunkenly mug for the camera. Kate pales noticeably.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks from the picture to Leopold. Slowly, she begins pecking away at the keys. She does not look up again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LAB - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate gives Leopold a tour of the lab stopping by Dr. Drakes area. Hidden behind chalk boards, calculator paper, and several empty Haagen Dazs containers, Dr. Drake searches for solutions.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Now within that astronomical structure, Dr. Drake here is searching for a pathway between your time and the present. He'll find it too if his arteries don't harden first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Astounding.

<LEOPOLD>
<DIRECTION>
(to Dr. Kau)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How are you proceeding?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<DIRECTION>
Dr. Kau merely grunts. Leopold looks at Kate.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't take it personally. Once Dr. Kau starts working, you just have to wait until her batteries run down. We're all pretty much like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
They head into Kate's office.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KATE'S OFFICE - DAY

Kate gathers her belongings, Leopold snoops at her notes.

	Thank you. And may I say that sometimes, in DIM light, you're not so bad yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
They stand together, Leopold grinning sheepishly.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God! Is that the time? I'm late. Therapy. Every Tuesday night.

</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>

</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>

<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am not certain I understand therapy.

</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No one does. That's why therapists can charge so much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
As she gathers her belongings, Leopold spots a very high heeled red shoe in Kate's bag.
</DIRECTION>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What exactly transpires during therapy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>

	Leopold. A gentleman does not ask those questions. Come on, we'll get you home.

<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really! I have finance and our address. I shall take a cabbie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<DIRECTION>
Kate hesitates.
</DIRECTION>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are late. I insist. I am NOT a child. Dr. Coles.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right. Don't bite my head off.

She shakes her head and walks out the door.

<DIRECTION>
INT. SUBWAY STATION - RUSH HOUR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate waits in line at the turnstile. Leopold, a ways back, grimaces noticeably at the smell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate heads through. Leopold follows banging painfully into the bar. A NUN hurriedly bumps into him from behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He tries pushing the bar but it doesn't budge. He turns around to step out of line but it is already too long. He stands NOSE to NOSE with the nun.
</DIRECTION>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't seem to...

<NUN>

</NUN>
<DIRECTION>
The nun deposits her token and SQUEEZES them both through as the train arrives at a deafening pitch, startling Leopold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He spots Kate entering the train and jumps into the car in the nick of time. The train departs, Leopold pressed awkwardly against the glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. N.Y.C. STREET - EARLY EVENING

Kate races from the subway station, entering the Arthur Murray Dance Studio. Leopold, thoroughly disheveled, follows at a distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DANCE STUDIO - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elderly Blue haired couples chat amongst themselves, men on the right, women on the left. Kate, in dance clothes, out of breath, stumbles in, making a b-line for the women's side.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_PINCUS>

	Miss my lesson? This is the only thing I have to look forward to all week. Is that a new dress Mrs. Pincus?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Pincus executes a fancy spin, proudly showing off her purchase. Across the room, MR. Pincus beams in anticipation.
</DIRECTION>

An elderly, overly made up dance instructor enters. She claps her hands together loudly.
</DIRECTION>
<INSTRUCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, kids. Pair up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INSTRUCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
The men slick back their hair. The women straighten their gowns. Kate stands to the side, self-consciously studying the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The men take their places on the dance floor. They flick their hand twice, inviting their women to dance. Cooly, elegantly, the women approach their partners. After a while Kate looks up, relieved. She stands alone. Ballroom music plays.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The couples effortlessly shift between steps and turns. Kate dances with an imaginary partner, stumbling, more than a beat behind, counting, animated, a concentrated YEARNING look spread across her face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The instructor approaches with a look of resignation.
</DIRECTION>
<INSTRUCTOR>

As Leopold struts across the room Charlie shakes his head and spontaneously begins to hum Sousa's Stars and Stripes March. Leopold becomes more and more agitated. As the song crescendos:

	The pudding tonight is excellent. Another thing I've noticed, everyone is in a great rush today. Instant Oatmeal, Instant Coffee, Speed Stick, Minute Maid. You'll find there's much to be said for moderation and languor.

<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh it's not that. It's just that it's sort of a vulgar crowd, is all. I'm not sure you'd have such a good time.

</CHARLIE>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps she has not met the right one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She has met the right one. HUNDREDS of times. But she pulls back. She cuts herself off. You turn around and suddenly you're dating a Sphinx.

	<DIALOGUE>
	One never can tell.
	</DIALOGUE>

	No...

	Who's the Merry Andrew now?! I think you're all talk and no action. What are you waiting for?

</CHARLIE>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do not know if there is a future in it.

CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LEOPOLD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate enters with an arm load of Leopold's discarded clothes. She drops them on his bed and begins to hang them in his closet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A notebook falls from his pants pocket. She puts it on the bureau. A beat. She quickly picks it up, sits on the edge of the bed and starts to read.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(reading out loud)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Royal family -- Uncouth. Making Out -- slow soulful kissing... Woman as equals??
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
She flips a page.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who drove the Chevy to the levy and why was it dry?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Kate smiles. She flips the page.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eyes shine when she talks about... science. Raises her voice when she knows she's wrong. BOSSY, BOSSY, BOSSY. Lose my train of thought when I see her smile. Most beautiful when she's angry. Honorable heart... Peasant feet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
The front door is heard slamming. Kate, alarmed, stuffs the notebook back in Leopold's pocket. She races to the door; glances back at the notebook, turns off the light and scurries from the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY - LATER THAT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The corridor is darkly lit. Kate leaves the bathroom as Leopold enters. They collide and separate but remain close together. Both are dressed in pajamas and speak softly.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ooops. Bread and butter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bread and butter. It's an old saying... Well not to you I guess. You say it when you pass someone in a cramped space. As close as bread and butter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So. Did you have a good time last night?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was very interesting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you find that person of quality?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Leopold looks at her a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. I did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(there is a pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess it's time to turn in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goodnight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches her door. Leopold stops her.
</DIRECTION>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kate?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<DIRECTION>
She turns. Leopold grasps for the words but the habit of inaction returns.
</DIRECTION>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goodnight.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he slowly closes the door)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PATRICE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie stands at Patrice's door with a large painting. He looks over at Leopold hiding the next doorway over. Charlie knocks. She opens the door.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi. I brought you some flowers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
He hands her the flower filled painting.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Charlie!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICE>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miss Wochuchowski? I was wondering if you would do me the great honor of accompanying me to the cinema tonight. And allowing me the privilege of escorting you to dinner afterwards.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Patrice shyly studies the painting.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's beautiful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICE>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie quickly looks at Leopold pleadingly. He really does not want to say this next part. Leopold, however, is adamant.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(deadpan)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gracing me with your conversation and company would mean the world to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
There is a long pause. Patrice watches Charlie in disbelief.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Um... 7:00?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICE>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	7:00 is fine. I'll call for you then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
They smile at each other for a long moment.
</DIRECTION>
<LEOPOLD>

</CHARLIE>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course it did.
	</DIALOGUE>

<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leopold, I... I'm... I have no idea what to do next!

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate is by the bookshelf gathering reference books on time and space. Leopold enters. He is suddenly embarrassed and doesn't know how to proceed.
</DIRECTION>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good morning. You're up early.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
She moves to her computer on the other side of the room. Leopold follows. Before she can sit down, Leopold pulls out her chair. She falls to the ground. He rushes to her side immediately.
</DIRECTION>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm terribly sorry!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Happens all the time...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
She opens a reference book and slowly begins typing at her computer. There is a pause.
</DIRECTION>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Coles?... ah, Kate? I was wondering...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<DIRECTION>
She stops working and looks at Leopold.
</DIRECTION>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What it is you're working on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. It's my computer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
She resumes her work.
</DIRECTION>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see. Actually I meant the work itself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm researching the correlations between your time and the present.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Leopold stares blankly.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm TRYING to get you home, Leopold.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie peaks in, signaling Leopold, spurring him on.
</DIRECTION>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have never seen a woman work as diligently and extensively before.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's made me the man I am today.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's quite a beautiful day, have you noticed? Perhaps you would permit yourself some time off and grant me the privilege of escorting you around the city this fine Spring afternoon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I'd love to but I can't. I've got too much work to do. Ask Charlie though. He'll go with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm afraid it really wouldn't be the same. It is YOUR company I am seeking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<DIRECTION>
Surprised, Kate turns around and looks at Leopold.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(gently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Leopold. I'm so sorry. I can't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see. Some other time then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes... Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Leopold sits at the far end of the room. Kate takes a moment then resumes typing. She STOPS and sits back in her chair. After a long moment, she subtly unplugs the computer with her foot and starts banging on the top of it.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh for crying out loud. Would you look at this? Leopold? The computer's on the blink again.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she bangs harder)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cheap piece of equipment. I can't...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe if you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	NO, no, it does this all the time. Just have to wait it out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Darn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Perhaps it is a sign?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she smiles at Leopold)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leopold trots his horse expertly along the horse path. Kate follows, clutching the horses neck, bouncing like a clown.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I... I must have gotten a funny horse...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Leopold turns and rides around Kate.
</DIRECTION>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Allow me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bethesda fountain. Boats on Central Park Lake. Couples in Sheeps Meadow.

Holding the reins of Kate's horse in one hand, Leopold grasps Kate's waist with the other as they ride a single horse through the greenery of Central Park.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MOVIE THEATRE - THE THALIA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A revival house. On the Marquee: "The Tenuous Duke" starring Ronald Coleman.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate and Leopold eat popcorn, Milk Duds, M & M's, and large drinks. The lights go down and the movie begins.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The enormity of the medium strikes Leopold at once. He involuntarily leans back in his chair grabbing Kate's shoulder, watching attentively. After a bit:
</DIRECTION>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that supposed to be my hair? Do you see how they think my hair looks?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<DIRECTION>
Kate looks over at Leopold and nods. Through his eyes, she too experiences movies for the first time. She moves close to him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
Grammercy Park, The Guggenheim Museum, Central Park Plaza, The Metropolitan Museum.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate and Leopold bound up the steps, entering the museum.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MUSEUM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Modern art exhibit. Leopold stares blankly at an empty white canvas. He turns to Kate questioningly.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's simplicity in it's purest form. It speaks volumes in it's nothingness. Whiteness representing emptiness. Hopelessness. It's bleak. Bleak!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Leopold eyes the painting skeptically. They move to the next object d'art. A toilet.
</DIRECTION>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aaand this represents...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<DIRECTION>
They burst into giddy laughter.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Absolutely nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
They round the corner, moving to the next room. Leopold's smile fades.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP: A painting of privileged Victorian society.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shaken, he gazes at a painting in a dream-like state.
</DIRECTION>
<LEOPOLD>
<DIRECTION>
(very quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd almost forgotten how beautiful it was. Truly. Beautiful.

Kate smiles sadly at Leopold. They slowly walk out.

<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

	I don't know how you keep up with it. I'm exhausted.

</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So am I.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll tell you what. Why don't I prepare dinner tomorrow night? I never have before. I mean even before I hit town. "Hit town" How's that? I can't imagine what it'll taste like, but I don't think it will be any worse than your cooking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leopold, I have a date tomorrow night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>

</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A blind date.

</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I'm so sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, that just means I haven't met him before. It was set up through friends.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>

Kate gets up. Leopold automatically stands.

<LEOPOLD>

	Another time then.

</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>

</LEOPOLD>
<DIRECTION>
As she gets to the door, she stops.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leopold? I had a wonderful time today. I can't remember the last time I took the day off and just played. I'd forgotten how beautiful this city can be... I want to thank you for that.

</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The pleasure was mine.

<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie, in a tie, is standing with Leopold at the dining room table. Kate wearing too much makeup for her date, runs into the bathroom in a BRIGHT RED DRESS.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a very fancy restaurant, Leopold. Are you sure you can teach me everything there is to know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(from the bathroom)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just don't swipe the silverware and give yourself away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nobody's talking to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is very simple. I will be your date. Just behave as you normally would and I'll correct you along the way. Now, escort me in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie and Leopold move across the room. After a beat, Charlie magnanimously gestures for Leopold to go first. Leopold gives his approval. Kate rushes out of the bathroom in a tight BLACK dress.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leopold and Charlie elegantly walk to the table. Charlie sits down, pleased. Leopold remains standing, incensed.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Leopold takes a cloth napkin, hits Charlie upside the head. Hard.
</DIRECTION>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pull the chair for a lady! Clod.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>

<LEOPOLD>
<DIRECTION>
(to Kate)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, really!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie stands up and pulls out the chair. As Leopold sits, Charlie pushes the chair in to hard.
</DIRECTION>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not shoveling coal into a furnace, Charles. Glide the chair in gently. Gently. Try it again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie gently glides Leopold to the table. He remains standing, not sure what to do next.
</DIRECTION>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, sit down!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now don't burst a vein or anything, but there are quite a few knives and forks here. How do I know what each one's for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Merely start from the outside and work your way in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<CHARLIE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Leopold.
	</DIALOGUE>

She looks at Leopold not knowing what to say. Finally
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is a tie I'm wearing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You look very nice, Charlie.

</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your bland date?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Blind date.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Remember to breathe, Kate. And don't use to many big words. You'll scare the poor slob away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(moving to the door)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is always the scary part.

<DIRECTION>
(she sings)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Open the door to my, Mystery Date."
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
She opens the door and looks straight up. Leopold and Charlie peer in closer to get a better look. In the doorway stands LARRY, great looking, very tall, a winner.
</DIRECTION>
<LARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi. Kate?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARRY>
<KATE>

</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>

</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>

</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>

He snaps his fingers to get the waiters attention startling Kate. She laughs nervously.
</DIRECTION>
<LARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So. What did Jeannie say about me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARRY>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	About you? Ah, she said you were tall.

</KATE>
<LARRY>

	<DIALOGUE>
	No.

The Maitre d' of this very fancy restaurant shows Charlie and Patrice to their seats. Charlie motions Patrice to go first just as Leopold has instructed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Maitre de pulls out Patrice's chair. Charlie gives him a look to back off. Charlie effortlessly glides Patrice to the table and takes his seat.

</KATE>
<LARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She said you were enormously sexy, had a great body, but you don't put out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARRY>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quite a compelling portrait.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<LARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(turning on the charm)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you say it's an accurate portrait?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARRY>
<KATE>

Leopold slowly carries a dinner tray to the dinning room table. He moves to the window and looks out. After a while he pours a glass of wine.

As they eat their dinner Larry drones on.
</DIRECTION>
<LARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So this guy wants to invest $50,000 in a stock that's no good. Here's what I do...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Kate stares absentmindedly at Larry, her mind somewhere else. She looks down at the fork in her hand. She switches to the proper one, reflecting on Leopold's etiquette. She notices her napkin lying flat on the table. She reaches for it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leopold unfolds his napkin and puts it on his lap. He begins to eat his dinner. Slowly. Elegantly. Alone.

Kate places the napkin on her lap. She stares at it a long while. Finally she looks up at Larry.

Then as she leaves, a parting shot.

<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sound of keys in the lock, then Kate bursts through the door.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leopold?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
The living room is dark and empty. She goes through the living room, past the hallway, into the bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leopold?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
His bedroom is empty. He is not there.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Leopold...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
She runs into Charlie's studio and stops short.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Next to Charlie's stern paintings, Leopold's portrait of Kate shines in the moonlight. She wears an antique dress. She is lovely. Kate sees herself as Leopold sees her and is touched. She turns and collides head on with Leopold.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bread and butter.

<DIRECTION>
He is wearing gloves and an apron. He rubs his bruised head, inadvertently leaving a trail of suds along his face.
</DIRECTION>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're back early. Did you enjoy your date?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(happily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
She moves in close, trying to remove the soap from his face.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here, you've got some...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
He wipes his face making it much worse.
</DIRECTION>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it gone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(laughing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
She uses the apron to wipe away the soap. They gaze at each other and become serious.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A funny thing happened to me on my bland date this evening, Leopold. I really can't explain it. This puffed- up, puritanical, blundering, greenhorn kept popping into my mind all night long at the most inopportune times. I couldn't get rid of him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How inconsiderate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, it was. The harder I tried, the more persistent he became. He's conceited and inflated and unseasoned and it doesn't seem to matter... He's 134 years old but I can't get him out of my head.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is he there right now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right here. Larger than life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll protect you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<DIRECTION>
They kiss. A long romantic passionate kiss.
</DIRECTION>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Coles, would you grant me license to dine with you tomorrow evening at eight o'clock?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Permission granted.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Until tomorrow, then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<DIRECTION>
They separate. A beat. Leopold gestures for Kate to go first. They head down the hallway together into their separate rooms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The table clock chimes eight times. Leopold enters from the kitchen dressed perfectly in the most UP TO DATE style. He carries a casserole dish.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A second later Kate enters from the hallway. She is wearing an OLD FASHIONED, ANTIQUE DRESS. She looks lovely.
</DIRECTION>
<LEOPOLD>
<DIRECTION>
(a little startled)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You look beautiful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	YOU do. What have you got there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Leopold opens the casserole dish.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hamburger Helper!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know you like it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<DIRECTION>
Kate smiles. She looks behind him into the kitchen. A COLOSSAL MESS. Leopold lights the candles and pulls out her chair. This time she's prepared. He slides her chair to the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM, LATER THAT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The candles have burned down, casting a romantic glow throughout the apartment. Louis Armstrong's "What a Wonderful World" plays. Kate and Leopold sit on the couch sipping wine.
</DIRECTION>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Um, where was I? So after my father died I had to go to work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you had many jobs?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Many. I got fired from all of them. I'm the most unskilled person I know. But they were just survival jobs while I was still in school. I always knew I wanted to go into science like my father. And I did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you miss him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think about him every day. He was courtly, just like you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you are a remarkable woman Katherine Coles.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You just don't get out much. You'd be surprised how remarkable I'm not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it is you who would be surprised.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<DIRECTION>
They kiss. Anxiously they stare into each other's eyes. They kiss again. Slowly, Kate leads him to her bedroom door. They look at each other, deciding.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Deliberately, cautiously, Kate opens the door.
</DIRECTION>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kate...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<DIRECTION>
Kate puts her fingers over Leopold's lips. Gently she leads him inside. They slowly embrace as the door closes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sunlight floods the room. Clothes are scattered about. Two figures lie curled up together sleeping in bed. One of the figures rolls around. The covers are pulled back revealing:
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<PATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>

INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leopold wearing a bathrobe is pouring coffee. The table is set for a huge breakfast. Kate also in a robe enters from the hallway. There is a moment of awkwardness as they see each other for the first time.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good morning.

They kiss shyly. Kate notices the feast.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look what you've done!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing? My own mother never made me a breakfast like this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will have to have a talk with her.

	About last night...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please sit down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls out a chair for her and kneels beside her.
</DIRECTION>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kate, I had never before been a considerate man. I had, with astonishing complacency, squandered my life, waiting for some incentive to force me into action. You have made me see how rare our time here really is. I am most beholden to you Kate. And always will be.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I sense the word "BUT" entering into this any minute now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Leopold takes her hands in his. She looks at him defensively, bracing for worst.
</DIRECTION>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do me the honor Katherine, of becoming my wife.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<DIRECTION>
Kate lets out a very girlish, high pitched scream
</DIRECTION>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shall I take that as a "yes"?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leopold! Did you just ask me to marry you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you, Kate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's entirely beside the point... You're moving way too fast here. Shouldn't we date first? I mean it's obvious the first one went well...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where I come from that's pretty much the way it works.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leopold, even though last night we... loved each other, that doesn't mean this morning we're engaged. It just doesn't work that way now.

	I have loved you since I first set eyes on you. I cannot imagine my life without you beside me. I want to marry you, Kate and make an honest woman of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh Leopold, sit down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
They switch places. Leopold sits and Kate kneels beside him.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Relationships these days are much more complicated than that. Women today have certain freedoms that men have been taking advantage of for centuries. You must have been aware of that. If you think about it clearly, it should be obvious to you that marriage between us is out of the question.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>

	Do you not love me Kate?

</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then consider my proposal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll think it over but I can tell you now the answer is...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
He kisses her. It's impressive.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(out of breath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Possibly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<LEOPOLD>

(a knowing smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need you beside me. I will not give up easily.

<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do what you have to do...
	</DIALOGUE>

Charlie enters. Kate and Leopold become extremely selfconscious.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Morning.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Morning!

</LEOPOLD_AND_KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie is immediately aware that something is not quite right. He studies the two of them and nonchalant sits at the table. Kate and Leopold serve themselves breakfast.
</DIRECTION>
<LEOPOLD>
<DIRECTION>
(to Kate)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Coffee?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEOPOLD>
<DIRECTION>
Kate nods. As Leopold pours, they look at each other shyly.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(after a pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would like some coffee.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course. Say when.

She pours Charlie's coffee until it overflows.

	When.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
As Kate wipes up the table, Charlie notices her ring. He eyes Leopold suspiciously. Leopold concentrates on his plate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie gives Kate a questioning glance. She smiles at him, looking both innocent and guilty at the same time. After a beat:
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh huh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
All smile privately and sip their coffee without another word.

INT. LAB - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Buried behind open books and crumpled up paper, Kate labors in earnest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stops suddenly, almost violently, and studies the notes in front of her. The coffee cup falls from her hand and breaks.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_KAY>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kate, are you all right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_KAY>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine! I'm fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
She covers her papers and self consciously cleans up her mess. She sits down slowly and peeks at her notes. She has SOLVED THE PUZZLE that will send Leopold back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks up in disbelief and glances through her window around the lab. Everyone is hard at work. Helplessly, she stares back at the paper on her desk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls open her drawer and takes out the picture of Carlson. She stares at it for a long time. She opens her mouth to call for the others, stops, and looks at the photo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly, with great indecision, Kate crumples up the paper. She returns the picture to the drawer. After a long moment, she opens a book, feigning research, her mind a million miles away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KATE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leopold and Kate sit on her bed watching David Lettering. Kate clutches her pillow close to her. She looks over at Leopold concentrating on the TV with furrowed brow. She smiles sadly. She takes her pillow and flings it off her bed. She snuggles up to Leopold. They watch TV. Together.

Leopold and Kate eat lunch. Leopold scans a newspaper. On the TV over the bar, Bob Dole is speaking out against gun control.
</DIRECTION>
<LEOPOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Public office is apparently still the last refuge for the incompetent. Show me a man who does not want his gun registered and I'll show you a man who should not own a gun. What is a pee-pee girl?

<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you reading?

	Leopold, I don't know if that's such a good idea.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Leopold holds Kate's face in his hands. Very slowly they part.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leopold takes his place in the machine and straps himself in. He places one hand on the red lever and the other against the glass pane on the door. Kate comes over and places her hand over his. Wordlessly, they say goodbye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a moment, Dr. Kau gently moves Kate away. Dr. Plodder silently raises his arm, signaling Leopold.

Kate smiles tenderly at Leopold.

INT. LAB - MONTHS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate raises her head. She sits at her desk surrounded by the doctors.

<DR_PLODDER>

Down from the horizon, a farm house. LEO COLES, 5 years old, rocks on his front porch swing. Using his bare hands as puppets he carries on a conversation. JULIA CARLSON pulls up in her car.

The two women scream, run to each other and embrace.

INT. KATE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate heads straight for the kitchen. Carlson scans the living room before joining her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Although rustic on the outside, the inside of the house is furnished with antiques and is Victorian in style.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(covering her agitation)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you like some tea? I wish you had called before you come over. It would have given me a chance to straighten up the house... myself... my life. Tell me what you've been up to. Catch me up on everyone. I heard you received some big endowment or something. I was going to write, then call, but...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
She picks up the cup and saucer but it shakes so violently she has to put it down.
</DIRECTION>
<CARLSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all right, Kate. I understand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLSON>
<DIRECTION>
There is a LONG PAUSE. Carlson gets the tea ready. Finally:
</DIRECTION>
<CARLSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'd leave in 9 days. That's not a lot of time to get your affairs in order... And I warn you, it's nearly impossible for an intelligent woman back there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLSON>
<DIRECTION>
Kate stands by the back door, looking out at Leo.
</DIRECTION>
<CARLSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's a fine boy Kate. Leopold would be proud. We're aware of your situation but we felt when the time came, you deserved the option.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLSON>
<DIRECTION>
Kate nods, trembling slightly.

	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Leo shows off his teeth.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then give your old mom a hug and go to bed.

</KATE>
<LEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEO>
<DIRECTION>
Kate wraps herself in an old blanket and moves through the house turning off the lights. It is very guiet. All we hear are Kate's footsteps and the sound of the clock ticking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She makes her way upstairs, enters her bed room. She sits down by the window at her desk. She sits a long time lost in thought.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She slowly pulls open a drawer and from deep inside pulls out an old photo album. She opens it and begins to look through.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE PHOTO ALBUM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside, old black and white photographs, newspaper clippings, magazine articles trace Leopold throughout his life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A photograph of Leopold looking as he did the night he departed this world. He stands stiffly beside his family for a formal portrait. Very discreetly, he points to a ring. It is the same ring Kate gave him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A newspaper article shows Leopold donating $100,000 to establish a scientific center researching studies in time and space.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A magazine picture shows Leopold, the sole male figure, marching to give women the vote.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A photograph of a large formal wedding. Leopold, around FIFTY, stands alone in the wedding party, surreptitiously pointing to his ring.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A magazine article shows Leopold in his SIXTIES establishing a scholarship program for studies in physics. He is surrounded by academia and subtly points to his ring.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A photograph of Leopold around SEVENTY shaking hands with Albert Einstein and smiling broadly for the cameras.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A professional photograph of Leopold at SEVENTY FIVE, sitting regally in a chair. Beside him, an EMPTY chair. He rests one hand on the back of the chair. The other he holds against his chest, showing off the ring.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An obituary with the headline, "Philanthropist, 80, dies in bombings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A tear falls on the page.

Kate cries silently, looking out the window. The camera follows her gaze past her property...

LEO, 24 and his BRIDE take to the floor for the first time as husband and wife and are greeted with applause. Kate, older, beautiful, hair cut short, looks on in wonder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie, standing with Patrice and their 6 blonde children, approaches Kate and leads her to the dance floor.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>

</KATE>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's happy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course he's happy. All weddings are happy. It's the living together afterwards that causes all the trouble.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Julia Carlson, under dressed, over anxious, enters the banquet hall. She stands at the back of the large room, searching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Couples fill the dance floor. Across the expansive room, over the tops of heads, Charlie and Kate bob amongst the guests. Leo cuts in. As they spin, in the briefest of seconds, Kate spots Carlson. She pales. They TURN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate peers over Leo's shoulder. Her eyes lock with Julia's. Julia nods with purpose. Kate holds onto Leo tightly, not wanting to let go. She buries her head in his chest.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, you're so young... I love you, Leo. Always remember that...
	</DIALOGUE>

INT. CONTROL BOOTH - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From behind a glass partition, Carlson works at her console. A monitor counts away the seconds. 59, 58, 57... In the darkened lab, Kate, dressed in early 1920s attire, straps herself in and smiles tearfully. Their voices echo in the lab.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<CHARLIE>

He puts his finger to her lips. He looks to his wife then back at Kate. He nods his head.
</DIRECTION>
<LEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go.

</LEO>
<DIRECTION>
They force themselves to smile, trying to get through the moment.
</DIRECTION>
<CARLSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ready!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLSON>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie, Leo and his new bride stand back. Inside the craft, the only light comes from the glowing red lever. Carlson raises her arm, signaling Kate. Then to her staff:
</DIRECTION>
<CARLSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	9, 8, 7...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLSON>
<DIRECTION>
Kate presses her hand against the glass as a final goodbye. She grabs the lever with her other hand and turns away, staring straight ahead. Charlie puts his arm around Leo.
</DIRECTION>
<CARLSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	3, 2, 1!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLSON>
<DIRECTION>
There is a BRIGHT WHITE FLASH. Kate is gone. The others stand there motionless, stunned.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The screen is BLACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. A LARGE VICTORIAN ESTATE - 1924 - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FLASH of light illuminates the forest at the Albany estate. A BEAT. Kate races from the forest onto a massive lawn, stumbling in mud as she hurries to the mansion's entrance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Huge double doors open to reveal -- AN ORNATE BALLROOM. The creme de la creme have gathered and dance. Kate overwhelmed, rushes down an elaborate staircase. Half way down she looses a shoe. She hesitates briefly then continues to the dance floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the center of the floor, Leopold, looking very distinguished and attractive, dances with a flirtatious young woman. Try as she might, Leopold keeps her at a distance.
</DIRECTION>
<FLIRT>
<DIRECTION>
(brushing his shirt front)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just love a starched white shirt. It's so elegant.

	<DIALOGUE>

</LEOPOLD>
<FLIRT>
<DIRECTION>
(with a big smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank YOU.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLIRT>
<DIRECTION>
The music changes: A LIVELY CHARLESTON. Leopold heaves a sigh of relief and makes his way through the crowd, up the staircase.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dancers become an intricate maze, a dead end at every turn as Kate searches each male face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the foreground, Leopold is stopped by a woman midway up the stairs. As they chat, Leopold reaches down and picks up the muddy slipper, offering it to her. She turns in a huff, flouncing down the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Simultaneously, in the background, Kate desperately looks for Leopold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leopold studies the slipper as he makes his way up the stairs. He slows down, hesitates and STOPS. Very slowly he turns around. He becomes very still. TEARS well up in his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ballroom clock strikes MIDNIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate climbs an opposite staircase to get a better view then STOPS. In her heart SHE KNOWS. Slowly she turns. Leopold stands quietly at the bottom of the stairs, gazing up at her. He extends his arm, showing her THE RING. He offers her his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd, the room, THE WORLD AROUND THEM, DISAPPEAR. Their eyes lock. As she descends the staircase, THE YEARS MELT AWAY. Kate's short hair grows long, cascading around her shoulders. The fine lines around Leopold's face are gone. They see themselves through each other's eyes, at the moment of youth, when they fell in love.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leopold bends down, places the slipper on Kate's foot. He rises, looks down at his hands and then up at Kate. His hands are caked with mud. She smiles helplessly. Not caring, he wraps his arms tightly around her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MUSIC begins to play, a slow waltz. He nods to her. She takes a deep breath. Her head bobs in rhythm. She begins to count silently. Leopold smiles, counting along.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THEY DANCE...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An elderly couple watch Leopold with interest.
</DIRECTION>
<LORD_WHITEHEAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who is that dancing with Leopold?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORD_WHITEHEAD>
<LADY_WHITEHEAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've never seen her before.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LADY_WHITEHEAD>
<DIRECTION>
Kate and Leopold dance past. They are older. As they gaze into each other's eyes, they twirl. THE LOOK OF YOUTH RETURNS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the center of the floor they stop dancing. THEY KISS. The rest of the world dances around them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Over this background... THE SCRAPBOOK PICTURES BLEED ONTO SCREEN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The old formal wedding photo becomes a photograph of Kate and Leopold the perfect bride and groom, both discreetly point to their rings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate stands with Leopold as he establishes a scholarship for studies in physics.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The old photograph of Leopold and Albert Einstein changes to include Kate, waving and smiling broadly for the camera.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The professional photograph becomes a double portrait. It shows the two in their 70's, sitting regally in matching chairs. They hold hands and smile serenely. Staring directly into the camera, they show off their rings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SLOWLY the scrapbook closes...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate and Leopold dance, the music swells as they become lost in the crowd. The clock CHIMES. Slowly we...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
