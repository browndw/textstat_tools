:SC: THE PROPHECY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With the sound of wind, of sand gritting against glass:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE UP ON:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A howling dust storm battering the doors and walls of a tiny woodplank church.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside, huddled together against the rage outside, are a small group of people. All in black, mostly elderly, they kneel in prayer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Before them, on the cramped altar, lies a man. Dressed in the uniform of a general, surrounded by the silk softness of his casket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's an old man, far from the crump of battles, consumed now with stillness, listening to the prayers of old people. Of desert wind, moaning through thin wood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The candle beside his head flickers and wanes in the ceaseless gusts, strains for life, then goes out.

EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's not the best part of town and probably never was. A place of seedy, anonymous brick flophouses shackled by rusting fire escapes, lying on an alley unique only for its bad drainage. It's here, in the dim, flinty light, that a figure enters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wearing a long coat and, despite the night, sunglasses, he pauses on the slimy asphalt and gazes up the sides of the flophouses, to their yellowish windows and competing Mexican radio stations. One window, dark and quiet on the third floor, catches his gaze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a metal hand railing in the alley that the long-coated figure effortlessly pops up onto. Sunglasses focused on the window, he lowers himself into a motionless crouch, a perch, on the railing with the ease of a crow. Or a gargoyle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dawn is a muddled, limp thing that does nothing to improve the alley. The figure is still there, a motionless gargoyle perched on the railing. Watching the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shadows shorten, the air grows warmer, and now there's movement behind the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sunglassed gargoyle drops down off the railing, jumps up to the first rung of the fire escape, and begins climbing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEHIND THE THIRD FLOOR WINDOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Is a room as grim as we expect. Lumpy iron bed, sink that's been pissed into one too many times, and SIMON; a man in a tight sweater and dark sunglasses, busily emptying his pockets on the ruined dresser: loose change, a town paper's obituary column.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Simon's sunglassed eyes look up suddenly, his body stifffening. He whips around to face the window just as it EXPLODES into fragments.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The gargoyle LEAPS into the room on the trail of glass. Simon spins and THROWS himself against the intruder. The two STRUGGLE savagely across the room, SMASHING chairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Simon manages a grip on the gargoyle's face and POUNDS the back of his skull against the wall. The gargoyle gets his locked fists up and SWINGS them like a war club, SMACKING Simon's face and SPRAWLING him backwards onto the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two, across the room for each other, pause.
</DIRECTION>
<GARGOYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARGOYLE>
<DIRECTION>
Simon's climbed to his feet, the two men in sunglasses now walking slow circles around each other.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leave me alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<GARGOYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've found it, haven't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARGOYLE>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
The gargoyle drops his head and DRIVES himself into Simon, who HAMMERS the gargoyle with his fists. Blood SMEARS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The gargoyle's gotten free a knife that he JAMS into Simon's leg. Pressing home his advantage, the gargoyle SLAMS Simon up against the wall. He TEARS open Simon's shirt, digging his fingers into the chest, RIPPING the skin aside, the first plunging deep, CRACKING the sternum bone, pushing even further, toward the blood gouged pumping beneath --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Simon PLOWS his knee up between the gargoyle's legs. Over and over. Till the grip loosens and Simon SHOVES him to one side, using the momentum and drives to SWING the body around and at the shattered window. The gargoyle SMACKS the frame and COLLAPSES, his head CRACKING on the sill and FORCING a shard of glass through his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Simon moves to the window and brushes aside the gargoyle's sunglasses, revealing two totally empty eye sockets. Pushing his thumbs into them, Simon uses the leverage to lift the gargoyle off the sill and push his body out the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The gargoyle bounces once on the fire escape, then spread- eagles thirty feet to the asphalt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Somebody turns up their Mexican radio station.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The gargoyle's a wreck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But he manages, slowly -- his shattered remains arguing every inch -- to climb first to his knees, then miserably to his feet. A bent, splattered, hopeless thing that manages to stumble three or four feet before being HIT by a freeway- speed firebird BOMBING down the alley.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The impact PINS the gargoyle to the grill and RAMS him into a brick wall, CRUSHING a chest that BELCHES out a sickly, bruised heart like a wet rag against the firebird's windshield.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THREE FLOORS ABOVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Simon leans against his splintered window and looks down at the pinned and very finished body of the gargoyle. His own shirt and pants are a mess of torn blood and his breathing is difficult. Pain flashes across his forehead as he checks that his own sunglasses still sit snugly on the bridge of his nose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the sound of a distant siren Simon turns and quickly finishes packing his duffle bag. Stiffly pulling on an oversize surplus army jacket that partly conceals the damage beneath, he picks up the bag and painfully shuffles out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The gargoyle, still pinned to the wall by the firebird.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FLASH bounces off his skin. Then another. He's being photographed. Go wide and find him in the middle of a police investigation. Bored blue uniforms, yellow barrier tape. The usual.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A plain jane sedan pulls up and deposits THOMAS DAGGET, thirties, tweed coat and steel notebook. He smiles at a couple of cops, ducks under the yellow barrier, and nods a greeting to an older uniform sergeant, BURROWS.

<BURROWS>
	<DIALOGUE>

Amongst the glass fragments at Thomas' feet is a pair of dark sunglasses. He picks them up, taps them in his palm, and looks out the window down to the man with no eyes, pinched between brick and chrome.

</BURROWS>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE SLOWLY TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sun sinking beneath the horizon of a vast and undulating expanse of desert.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Travel through the landscape as the sky purples and darkens and silhouettes tall, finger-like spires of volcanic rock. Hear the coyotes, the wind making its constant, probing search. Before the night swallows it all whole,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Come upon The Town.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It used to be something. But that's long gone. Now, wrapped in the sucking blackness of a wilderness night, it's a shell of a place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lights still burn in some of the windows but fool no one. The ghosts are the majority here. Biding their time. Waiting for The Town to surrender and slip beneath the waves of the desert.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wind slinks over the hills, creeps down past boarded-up storefronts, skeletal ocitillo, and the rusting hulks of abandoned mining equipment. The corpse of a summer's kite twists slowly on a power line.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE EDGE OF TOWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the inky oblivion of the road, comes a crunch of gravel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF TOWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stands a large, nineteenth century brick schoolhouse. An icon from a more prosperous past, its dark massiveness was meant for scores of ruddy-faced miner's kids. Now it seems to be imploding, eating itself with creeping decay. On this night it is silent and dark but for a small glow in one corner and the faint sound of children's voices in song.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a hymn. An ancient, Latin one. The melancholy beauty of voices rising and falling in choir.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE BUILDING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Is a school auditorium. On the stage, dwarfed by it, are twenty five students from first grade to high school, singing together as a choir. A young woman, KATHERINE, directs their acapella voices as the small group of parents, lonely in the huge room, look on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUTSIDE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The voices drift on the night, down the road, and lap against the peeling facade of a storefront. A mortuary.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rooms are dark but for one. There, bathed in the flickering light of a tall candle, lies the body of the old general we saw at the opening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FRONT DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Of the mortuary has a locked handle that jiggles from outside. A small panes of glass beside it is BROKEN by a hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE SCHOOL AUDITORIUM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Young voices struggle with the complicated hymn and its pain of centuries. Faces white, Mexican, Navaho. Katherine guides them with soft hands. She smiles in pride. They smile back. Proud. Of her. Of themselves and the beauty coming from their mouths.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One small, beautiful navaho girl, MARY, maybe eight, gets a special smile of special friendship from Katherine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE MORTUARY'S
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Front door now stands ajar in the darkness. Small shards of glass glisten in the carpet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Is the dead General. Even in the bleached ravages of age and death, his face still holds a shadow of vigor and pride.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It takes a moment in the weak flicker of the candle to realize someone is there with him. Simon in his oversized surplus jacket. His arms are folded tightly across his middle, as if in deep cold. But his gaunt face is moist with sweat and his breath is shallow and uneven. He stares at the old man behind sunglasses and takes slow, cautious steps forward into the amber glow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holding out two blood-stained fingers, Simon touches the General's forehead. A new strain crosses his perspiring face. Concentration.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Placing his right palm on the General's chin and the left on his forehead, Simon CRACKS OPEN the dead man's mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE SCHOOL AUDITORIUM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hymn is reaching its aching climax of medieval longing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE MORTUARY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Simon leans down to the open mouth, and in a voice soft and deeply weary,
</DIRECTION>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Qui ex Patre Flioque procedit...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
Then, with the school choir distant and faint in the night, the living man places his mouth over that of the dead man...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE SCHOOL AUDITORIUM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's coffee and cake now as parents proudly hug their children and congratulate their young teacher. Even in this gloomy, crumbling building it's a warm, small town moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUTSIDE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Simon has left the mortuary and now limps with difficulty through the silent streets, leaning against shop walls for support.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE SCHOOL BUILDING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the doors out steps the eight year old Navaho girl, Mary. Alone, she stands on the stone stairs and looks out into the night with sensitive eyes. She concentrates. Knows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Katherine follows her out.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey bright eyes, what's the deal being out here all alone without a coat?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
The girl's eyes seem too serious for a child's. Too perceptive.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Someone's here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<DIRECTION>
Katherine looks out into the night.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
Mary stares a moment longer, then becomes a child again, smiling and popping Katherine one on the arm.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pig out on all the cake?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, there might be one, tiny, skinny piece left, but you're gonna have to race me for it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
Mary suddenly points past Katherine's shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<DIRECTION>
When Katherine turns Mary dashes back into the building.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ha!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You little sneak!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
Katherine chases after her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THAT MOMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Simon comes limping up from the road. His breathing's bad now as he moves stiffly along the school's brick walls, coming to an old, rusty back door he creaks open and slides through.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He climbs a littered and disused staircase, past broken beer bottles and condom wrappers to a dark and creaky second floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's part of the school building long abandoned. Doors to classrooms lie half off their hinges, windows are broken, rats squeak between ancient desks stacked like funeral pyres.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Simon, his breath echoing in the cold darkness, shuffles along the broken linoleum till he comes to a rectangle cut in the wall where a row of lockers used to be. He crawls into the space and there, surrounded by rot, curls up on himself and sucks his thumb.

Thomas lights an offering candle and kneels for a brief, silent prayer. He crosses himself, stands, and walks for the door. Before leaving he glances back at the altar. A questioning moment between two akward, estranged friends.

	When babies grow up their bones get larger by adding calcium layers over the interior haversham canals. Child growth isn't uniform though, comes in spurts that always leave growth rings in the bone.

INT. POLICE OFFICE

<DIRECTION>
Thomas at his desk, working under a lone gooseneck lamp. He's translating the fourteenth chapter of St. John's Revelations from Latin onto a slip of paper. Finished, he sets the ancient bible down, turns off the gooseneck, and leans back in his chair, alone in the dark.

EXT. DESERT - EARLY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Here, outside The Town, horizons are distant, faraway things. The sky overhead is streaked red and blue with barely morning as the screen door of a simple stucco house swings open. It's Katherine, the teacher. Wearing levis and boots, she carries a saddle swung over one denim shoulder out to a corral behind the house where a horse shuffles and whinnies impatiently.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In a minute, in a minute...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
Katherine throws the saddle over the horse and cinches it down as the sun, still tucked behind pink and grey cliffs, begins to heat up the sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SANDSTONE CANYON - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Deep and narrow, an idyllic canyon of compressed sandstone walls smoothed, rounded and etched by centuries of wind. A tiny creek flows past weak banks of scrub pine and pocked sycamore. A silent place a long way and a long time from anything but the approach of galloping hooves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Katherine and her horse run full-out through the canyon, the clack and splash of hooves echoing off steep, shadowed walls. Horse and rider drive each other harder and harder, their hot breath brief clouds in the arch, thin desert air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Boulders shattered by winter cold and summer heat, deep wind- cut caves hiding scorpions, sidewinders, or a wary mountain lion all pass as in a blur; arrogant hawks and patient buzzards, ruins of thousand year old Anasazi villages high on the cliffs, their weather-beaten skulls, seen and unseen, staring out; everything is one smear of color and smell as Katherine gallops past them and up the cliff trail, out of the canyon, and onto the main plateau.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE PLATEAU
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Katherine strokes her horse and feeds it a bag of carrots. She pulls a thermos from the pack, sits down against some old man rocks, and with the coffee steaming in her hand, greets the sun now cresting the Chuska Mountains.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a rutted, silty dirt road nearby. An ancient, battered school bus rattles its way past and stops. The bus driver, a Navaho, JOHN, climbs down and rubbing the side of his head painfully walks up to Katherine.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You could save my life with some coffee.

It's dinosaur day. Katherine has a large fossilized bone on her lap.

The little girls smile. They like Camposaurus. Katherine holds up another bone fragment.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is a leg fragment that belongs to the killer of the plateau, Alosaurus. Alosaurus was a vicious carnivore, which meant he'd eat anything that moved, especially nice, juicy Camposaurs.

The little boys grin. They like Alosaurus.

	Both these guys lived together right here on the White Rock plateau eighty million years ago, when this area used to be on the banks of a huge, shallow sea.

	"And as in the first war, the angels so fought over the nature of their God, and there was much vanity and destruction in heaven. For some angels called their Lord the son of God, and others called Him the begotten father of Jesus Christ." What do you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAGGETT>
<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've never heard that quote before. Theologically, The "first war" obviously refers to the war in heaven where Michael the archangel threw out Satan and his gang. Old time bible stuff. But this implies there was a second war. That's news to me.

<DAGGETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the rest of it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAGGETT>
<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, it's a fairly common theological debate. Or was. The idea that if Christ is God's son, does that make him less than God or are they the same being in different forms. That very argument almost tore the early Christian church apart in the 4th Century. That was the good old days when people actually worried about theology. Anyway, it was settled when the bishops of the world got to together at the Council of Nicene in 325 and hashed out the various interpretations of scripture into a uniform dogma of belief. The result was the Nicene Creed, which basically said that Christ was in fact the same as God and was owed the same power and respect as the Father. That they were the same.

	Who knows? Vichini was the greatest biblical scholar of the age, some claimed he made his own translations from the original writings. Maybe he did find some unknown writings by John.

The sun is hard today as it beats down on Jerry's large- brimmed felt hat. Daylight and Jerry don't get along very well. His sunken, filmy eyes squint at its glare. The decayed flesh cracking along his cheeks flames at its touch. He shuffles down the sidewalk, the brackish, amber fluid that gurgles down his leg filling his shoes and leaving behind shiny wet footprints like a snail.

There's nobody around the back door and its unlocked. Jerry's shrunken claws pull it open.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry pulls the brim of his hat down even further as he works his way past rack after rack. The single uniform he meets looks only casually at Jerry's lapel ID badge. It's on the third shelf he finds it. John Doe #78. Jerry lifts the box and walks out.

Tiled floor and refrigerated corpses. Nobody's around when Gabriel enters. He walks over to a file cabinet and removes a thick folder. Then he walks to the big filing cabinets, the ones that hold a body in each drawer. He strolls along, tapping each label till he finds the one he's looking for, slides it open, and looks down at the naked body of the gargoyle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's been sewed back together. Kind of. Gabriel grabs the eyeless corpse under the armpits and drags him out onto the floor where he pushes the legs together and outstretches the arms, like a crucifix. From his coat Gabriel takes out a small vial of oil and rubs it onto the gargoyle's feet and hands. Anointing them. Then with the tip of his finger, he draws a faint sign of the cross on the forehead, stands, and walks for the door.

In the background, as Gabriel leaves, we see the body of the gargoyle BURST into flame.

EXT. DESERT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On an utterly lonely blacktop, Gabriel shoots by in his top- down rambler, insignificant in the night's vastness. Jerry's in the back, feet up on the seat.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you need me? I can hardly walk now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some things are human work, son. Live or dead, human work. Besides, I like you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lucky moi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel suddenly stands on the brakes, SCREECHING the rambler to a dusty stop. He kills the engine and everything is instantly whispering night and coyote howls. Gabriel climbs out and walks to the edge of a cliff. Far below, nestled among the finger-like spires of volcanic cones, lies The Town. Twinkling lights in a cold, dark embrace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel pushes his sunglasses up his nose and smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can always smell a graveyard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Two coyotes begin fighting and snarling with each other in the dust nearby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On a low hill at the edge of town. Cracked, sinking headstones. The rambler's parked next to a new one, Slim Pickens on the AM, as Jerry digs up the fresh grave marked General Arnold Hawthorne. Gabriel sits perched on the headstone over the grave like a winged creature.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope you're enjoying this.

<GABRIEL>

</GABRIEL>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I did it, didn't I? I did kill myself.

</JERRY>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, yes. Technically.

</GABRIEL>
<JERRY>

<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Jerry. I'm touched. Really.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry's shovel CLANKS onto something hard. He scrapes away the dirt, revealing a coffin lid. With a socket wrench Jerry removes the fastening bolts, then with the edge of his shovel, pries open the lid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's the ancient, wasted general we saw at the beginning. His medals flash in the moonlight.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not much to look at.

Gabriel leaps off his perch down into the grave.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- It's what's on the inside.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel reaches down, places one hand on the General's forehead, one on his chin, and BREAKS the mouth open. He gazes down into it. Then suddenly stiffens and straightens up.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>

He cradles the phone, stares at it, then picks up his overnight bag.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE TOWN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Silent and dead at this hour. Gabriel's boots creak on the floorboards of the 19th century plank sidewalks. He taps his finger aimlessly along plate glass shop windows.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boy, what a dump, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry, limping on a foot that's caving in on itself, wiping the spinal fluid out of his dead eye, shuffles along behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel pops off the elevated sidewalk, grabs a parking meter and swings himself playfully around.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why can't this shit ever go down in Miami? Or Bora Bora? I feel like I've spent my whole damn stay in gin swills like this.

<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Life's a bitch.
	</DIALOGUE>

Gabriel suddenly freezes. He sticks his nose up, sniffs like a coyote, then abruptly drops to the ground in a push-up and smells the dirt. Tastes it with his tongue. Smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well well...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE SCHOOL BUILDING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A fracture of broken moon tumbles through shattered windows and falls dully across shapes old, shapes forgotten, and one shape trying hopelessly to drag itself across the floor. It's Simon; breath a rasp, blood-soaked pants leaving a long smear behind him like a hemorrhaging snail. He coughs, drags an arm across the lenses of his sunglasses,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And looks up at a pair of black, lizard-skin boots.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Simon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Simon rolls on his back and sighs.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gabriel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
Simon looks up at puss-faced Jerry, leaning quietly in a dark corner.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't mind me. Just along for the ride.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel sits down against the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, what shall we talk about? Theology?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a little talked out on theology.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fair enough...

<DIRECTION>
Gabriel turns his boot to the moon, watches the pale light glint back off the lizard scales.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know why I'm here.

</GABRIEL>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yes.

</SIMON>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That would have been too easy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Simon suddenly JUMPS to his feet. Tries to escape. Jerry trips him, SPRAWLING Simon back to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, Simon. Get serious.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel walks over to him. Puts his face close.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now. Where's the soul?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know. So high. Used to reside in the recently departed General Hawthorne.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>

Simon doesn't answer. Gabriel shrugs.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have it your way, big guy.

<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>

<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you even remember what this war's about?

Gabriel pauses, almost thoughtfully. Then he smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's hardly the point, is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess I never did get the point.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Happens.

</GABRIEL>
<SIMON>

</SIMON>

Gabriel grasps Simon's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then join us, Simon. Reject the Nicene Council. We were here first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't do it, Gabriel. I don't even know why anymore, but I can't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know the routine.

</GABRIEL>
<SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
(swallows hard)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel's hand is suddenly on Simon's face, fingers spread, claw-like. They press into the flesh. Hard. And harder. Until Simon starts to bleed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then to burn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KATHERINE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Katherine startles abruptly in her bed at the faraway sound of Simon's screams. Screams carried either on the wind or her dreams.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MARY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Asleep, sweaty, shivering, Mary suddenly opens her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE SCHOOL BUILDING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel releases his grip on Simon, letting him fall back against the wall, afire. His clothes twist and blacken. His skin creeps and pops. His sunglasses melt and fall away; revealing two hollow pits beneath. Gabriel lifts Simon's entire body up off the floor by just the disintegrating face, and stares into the hollow pits.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not yet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
And the fires go out. Gabriel drops the crackling, acrid body onto the floor. Impossibly, through the sizzling mucus and molten hair, it breathes. It gasps in pain. It won't die.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can do this for five months, Simon...

Finishes dressing for school, picks up her teaching bag, and crunches out across the gravel to her pick-up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE SCHOOL BUILDING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel's lizard boots pace back and forth past Simon's writhing, burning body. Gabriel's more jittery now. Losing his patience. He bends down and pulls Simon's face up to his.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is getting boring, Simon.

<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>

</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
The seared skin around Simon's mouth comes off in Gabriel's hand. But Simon is still, even now, silent.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
He flings Simon with a horrible crunch against the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm just about out of tricks here. You're a tough one, friend. Old school.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
He walks over and places a hand with something like friendship on Simon's charred shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God loves you, Simon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
And with the other hand Gabriel JAMS his fist into Simon's chest, PULLING OUT a lumpy, burned heart. Simon's mouth springs open and hisses emptily. Gabriel slips the heart into his pocket and lets go of Simon's shoulder. The body instantly disintegrates and crashes to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE TOWN - MORNING
</DIRECTION>

Katherine squints at the morning glare as she drives through town. Pulling into the school's drive she sees, parked at the building's back door, a sheriff's patrol car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SCHOOL BUILDING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Katherine comes up the stairs of the building's abandoned floor, passing the stacks of rotting desks toward where she last saw Simon. There's a bad smell in the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At a turn stands a deputy that looks up as Katherine approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<DEPUTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You may want to skip this, ma'am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEPUTY>
<DIRECTION>
Katherine looks past him to where a second deputy crouches down beside... beside something. It's human shaped, but like a shadow. A shadow twisted in agony and slicked with a tarry, smoldering ooze. The smell is overpowering. The crouched deputy has a handkerchief over his mouth.

<DIRECTION>
Mary is still in bed, droopy-eyed and sweating. Her grandmother is there, and so is an elderly Navaho. He stands beside Mary's side, holding above her body a clenched pouch that he passes slowly back and forth.

The old man mumbles a soft chant as he moves the pouch back and forth across Mary's body.

EXT. MARY'S FAMILY TRAILER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Katherine walks back out toward her pickup. She stops. Thirty yards away, almost invisible in the sage say for the glare of its evil, intelligent eyes, is a coyote. As she feels it's gaze a shadow suddenly crosses her shoulder. Katherine turns quickly but only barely catches, out of the corner of her eye, a glimpse of something very large.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And winged.

Small townish; old adobe and stucco walls, cannon on the front lawn, every door loudly declaring itself a department: SOCIAL SERVICES, COURTS, and, SHERIFF.

<DIRECTION>
INSIDE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Sheriff's personal office is turn of the century regal, with high beam ceilings and rotating fans. Nothing seems newer than 1940, including the coffee pot the Sheriff pours a mugful from. Trim with glasses, bolo tie and boots, he looks like Barry Goldwater.

Thomas tosses his bag onto the bed, opens the balcony door, and looks out on the crumbly shale hills, the abandoned prospecting shacks, and the Chuska Mountains, clouds brewing darkly across its shattered back.

A close-up of the circled newspaper obituary for General Hawthorne. The paper lowers and reveals behind it the general's grave. The dirt around the tomb is loose, recently filled. The grave keeper, a young, gangly, drifter type stands nearby with his shovel.

INT. THE SCHOOLHOUSE

<DIRECTION>
Thomas's breath escapes in warm clouds here in the unheated, abandoned part of the building. Rats scurry away from feeding on the dark, human-like stain on the floor as Thomas crouches down beside it. He probes the dried, black, crusty flotsam with his ball-point pen. Just like the burned body back at the morgue.

Far away you can hear the sounds of children. Of a teacher's voice.

It's only past the final door, into the smallest corner of the building, that the walls become clean and brightly painted by eager third graders. The creepy silence transforms itself into the giggles of children as they bang open the classroom door and whoop themselves outside for recess.

ACROSS THE STREET

Up the crumbly embankment, sitting perched on the roof of an abandoned house, is Gabriel. He watches Thomas walk to his car. He watches the children playing, lifting his nose to snort the air, like a coyote.

INT. THE TOWN LIBRARY

Thomas sifts through some clippings on General Hawthrone. Tactical genius. The man who saved Korea. Brutal. Almost court marshalled a dozen times for his inspired savagery. A truly ruthless man -- who spent the last twenty years quietly tending his garden in a dying town.

INT. THE TOWN CHURCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Small, simple, and woodplanked. The church we saw at the beginning. Thomas sits there, staring at the candles, the altar, the crucifix.

He's alone there. But for a creeping buzz. A feeling in the air.

	Don't get me wrong. I think it's an excellent sign of character.

There's something cold and creepy about Gabriel. Out of place in here. There's another sound. Teeth chattering far in the back. Thomas turns and sees Jerry, deep in the shadows of the choir box. Jerry waves.

<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never mind him. He shouldn't even be in here. Least not standing.

	When I was younger I used to believe that no matter how much you mucked around in your life, one day, if you listened hard enough, a voice would tell you what you were really cut out to do. And when it didn't show up on schedule I decided to go look for it. And I looked in a lot of places, believe me. I drove that road out there so far that the end became the beginning again. And it was when I got here that I realized there never was going to be a voice. So I stopped looking and took the first job they offered me. That make any sense to you?

	...There, and there. Now pucker your lips... aim it that way, and just blow a little bit, this is a special trumpet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
The boy puffs lightly. The trumpet emits a piercing, clear note that SHATTERS a window high up in the abandoned part of the building. The youngsters whoop and applaud.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very good, Timmy. Very good. Here, have a Junior Mint on me. Open up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
As Timmy opens his mouth we clearly see Gabriel looking down into it. Looking for something...
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's next?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Katherine approaches the scene warily. The children all beg for their turn. Gabriel selects Sandra, one of Mary's second grade friends, and puts her on his knee.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And who are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<SANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sandra.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANDRA>
<DIRECTION>
She can barely get her fingers around the trumpet.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And did you see the man upstairs, Sandra?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<SANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A little.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANDRA>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you talk to him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<SANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANDRA>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And who did, Sandra. Who talked to the man?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<SANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANDRA>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And where is Mary, Sandra?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<SANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She isn't here. She's sick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANDRA>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've got very pretty teeth, Sandra. Here, let me see...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
He gently pushes down her chin with his thumb, opens her mouth, and gazes in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Katherine enters the circle.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell do you think you're doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel looks up, unperturbed, and smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just talking to the kids, Ma'am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get off his knee, Sandra. Everyone else, go inside. Now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
The kids reluctantly shuffle off.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Bye, Gabriel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See ya, kids. Be sure to study your math.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
He has the same sunglasses as Simon. The same cold, creepy air about him.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHERINE>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a long story.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry suddenly snorts loudly, trying to retrieve a sticky red glop that starts running out of his nose.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ignore him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everyone else does.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know what the hell is going on, but you both better get out of here. Right now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHERINE>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're right...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
He climbs to his feet and stands close to her.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...You have no idea what's going on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
He stands there a beat. That terrible coldness that swirls about him. The shriek of ghosts under his breath. Then he climbs into the rambler with Jerry and pulls away. Katherine watches the car drive off, then yells over to the school janitor.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Al! Keep an eye on the children for me. I'll be right back. And call the sheriff.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHERINE>
<JANITOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sheriff? What the hell do I tell him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANITOR>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just call.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
Katherine gets into her pickup and starts the engine.

EXT. THE TOWN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Katherine drives through the main drag and out past the fringe of town. As she passes the old copper mine she sees, parked near the mine's tunnel entrance, Gabriel's rambler.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT MARY'S GRANDMOTHER'S TRAILER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Katherine pulls up, she's surprised to see Thomas climbing out of his own car.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You weren't suppose to be here till noon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHERINE>
<DAGGETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a little early yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAGGETT>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wanted to check on her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHERINE>
<DAGGETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That makes two of us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAGGETT>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the sandy lot that extends back from the trailer is a wizened cottonwood tree. Katherine, Thomas, and Mary are seated beneath its shade. Katherine is protective of the little girl, running a hand maternally through her hair.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How are you feeling, pumpkin?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHERINE>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is Mr. Dagget, Mary. He'd like to ask you some questions. You don't have to answer if you don't want to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHERINE>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<DIRECTION>
There's a dreamy, far-away look in Mary's eyes. It worries Katherine.
</DIRECTION>
<DAGGETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mary, when you talked to man up in the building --
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAGGETT>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Simon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<DAGGETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Simon. What did Simon say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAGGETT>
<MARY>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's funny. "Simon says".
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<DAGGETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. Like the game.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAGGETT>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm good at it. I'm very clever.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<DAGGETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll have to play together sometime.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAGGETT>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Simon even said so. He also asked if I could keep a secret.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<DAGGETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what was that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAGGETT>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something he gave me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What, pumpkin?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHERINE>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then it wouldn't be a secret.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<DAGGETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a good friend not to tell, Mary. But I'm a friend of Simon's too. So if you ever want to tell, you can to me. Okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAGGETT>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a secret...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<DIRECTION>
Mary lowers her head and shuts her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...But sometimes it hurts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<DIRECTION>
Thomas and Katherine exchange looks. Mary's pretty eyes rise again as she calmly asks, in that cute little eight year old voice:
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you ever killed a chinaman?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<DAGGETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No Mary, I haven't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAGGETT>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They don't bleed. Not the way you and I do. Or maybe it was just the cold...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<DIRECTION>
Thomas looks to Katherine for an explanation, but she's as confused as him.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've killed them, you know. Lots. You could always tell when they were coming. There'd be the trumpets first. Every note flat. Then those songs... After that they'd charge. Right down through the snow. The guns would freeze and it would be just knives... It was so cold and there were so many of them. But I was smarter than they were. Even at Chosin, I was smarter...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<DIRECTION>
Mary's been explaining this in a girlish, show-'n-tell kind of way. Suddenly her face cracks as her voice chokes with a sob.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It scares me, Miss Henley. I hate it. Please, make it stop!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<DIRECTION>
She buries herself into Katherine's arms, sobbing.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Make it stop!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<KATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
(rocking her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay... It's okay...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
Mary suddenly pushes away and runs back toward the trailer, into the arms of her grandmother.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, I didn't mean to --
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHERINE>
<GRANDMOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all right, Miss Henley. We know you love Mary...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDMOTHER>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are we going to do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHERINE>
<GRANDMOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's going to have the Enemy Ghost Way. We leave this afternoon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDMOTHER>
<DIRECTION>
The grandmother turns and walks back to the trailer.
</DIRECTION>
<DAGGETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where will they do the ceremony?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAGGETT>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In the home village. The Hand Trembler must have found corpse sickness...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHERINE>
<DAGGETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're taking her away? Shouldn't she see a doctor?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAGGETT>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's already seen a doctor.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then, under her breath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That son of a bitch...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHERINE>
<DAGGETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAGGETT>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gabriel the children called him. The little shit was hanging around my kids this morning asking about Mary. He and his buddy make a real pair.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHERINE>
<DAGGETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe it's time I checked out Mr. Gabriel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAGGETT>
<DIRECTION>
Katherine turns from trailer and looks at him.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know where he parks his car.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THOMAS'S CAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Katherine and Thomas drive back down the road leading to town.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chinamen? Chosin? I've never heard her talk like that before.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHERINE>
<DAGGETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chosin Reservoir was a Korean war battle the Marines had against the Chinese, supposedly the bloodiest hand-to-hand fighting of the century. Someone been teaching that to your class?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAGGETT>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, right next to Jack 'N Jill.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHERINE>
<DAGGETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where would she have heard it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAGGETT>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nobody I can think of.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHERINE>
<DAGGETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAGGETT>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	General Hawthorne.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHERINE>
<DAGGETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did she know him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAGGETT>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He didn't like children.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHERINE>
<DAGGETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You couldn't and tell a story like that to one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAGGETT>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls over to the side near the copper mine entrance. No sign of the rambler.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was there earlier.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
Thomas drives up the dirt path to the mine's tunnel entrance. They climb out and stand near its mouth. In the dust is the rambler's tracks and several footprints leading into the mine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thomas steps up to the edge of the tunnel. It's a black, yawning thing that swallows the sunlight whole for breakfast.
</DIRECTION>
<DAGGETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I was smart I'd call the Sheriff or somebody in town who knows this place. Then again, there is one thing worse than getting killed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAGGETT>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHERINE>
<DAGGETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looking like an idiot if it's nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAGGETT>
<DIRECTION>
He pops his trunk and takes out a flashlight.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll come along.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHERINE>
<DAGGETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, if someone has to fall a hundred feet down a black pit, he should at least be on official duty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAGGETT>
<DIRECTION>
Thomas switches on the light and takes a tentative step inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DAGGETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then again, it is kind of spooky in there. Here, you can hold the flashlight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAGGETT>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE MINE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sun very quickly becomes a memory. And after the first bend it isn't even that anymore. There's only the glow of the flashlight; glancing off the abrupt edges of tunneled rock. Here and there are the flotsam of a bankrupt industry; dented ore carts lying on their side, rusted drill bits, piles of support timbers. And all around them the sucking blackness of the earth.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's cold...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
They walk further down into the mine. The atmosphere becomes close and creepy. Thomas has been following tracks left in the dusty floor that abruptly disappear. He stops and sighs.
</DIRECTION>
<DAGGETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAGGETT>
<DIRECTION>
-- A BAT suddenly SHRIEKS out of the darkness, glancing off Thomas's shoulder and TANGLING in Katherine's hair. She screams and spins around, loosing her footing and half falling into a yawning ore chute she hadn't seen beside her. Thomas rushes over and pulls her out. She climbs shakily to her feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DAGGETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAGGETT>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah... Sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
Thomas takes a last pass at the mine shaft with his flashlight.
</DIRECTION>
<DAGGETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I've seen enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAGGETT>
<DIRECTION>
As he turns to leave the flashlight burns out.
</DIRECTION>
<DAGGETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wonderful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAGGETT>
<DIRECTION>
He bangs it once against his thigh before he notices for the first time a dim, amber light coming from a space between the rocks.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHERINE>
<DAGGETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. Maybe a bum or something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAGGETT>
<DIRECTION>
But his gun's out at his side. Just in case. They follow the light to the gap in the rock, gingerly stepping into
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CAVERN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- That could easily belong to a bum. It's Gabriel and Jerry's digs. Just the moldy blanket, single oil lamp, piles of twinkie wrappers,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And something else.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From outside the cave it's the same whine, the same blurryness that drips off Gabriel like sweat. But once they step into the room, into the lair, it suddenly jumps in volume. This is where Gabriel sleeps, and it's thicker here, like honey on the walls. Thomas has difficulty focusing his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you feel it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHERINE>
<DAGGETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAGGETT>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
But Thomas can't hear Katherine anymore, her voice has disappeared beneath the whine. As it becomes too much he leans his weight against the rock wall and shuts his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's then they come. Flashes of images: Of screams and fire. Of impossible vistas of emptiness and death. And shrieking overhead, shrieking everywhere; grotesque, winged creatures with no eyes. Some with faces we know; Gabriel, Simon, and the gargoyle. All these images are being jammed into both their minds by the cave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thomas forces his eyes open but the scenes playing all around him won't go away. Tears are running down Katherine's face as she stands there locked in the same images. Thomas stumbles about the room as if drunk, the visions, incomprehendibly black visions of war and destruction on an alien plateau, eat his brain. He sinks to his knees and begins to cry.
</DIRECTION>
<DAGGETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh no... Oh God no...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAGGETT>
<DIRECTION>
Katherine's curled up on the floor like a child, weeping. The images are driving them mad. Thomas, fighting the insanity pounding at him, crawls pathetically across the floor to the oil lamp. His fingers grasp it spasmotically as he rises to his knees and leans back.
</DIRECTION>
<DAGGETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAGGETT>
<DIRECTION>
He HEAVES the lamp against the cave wall, where it EXPLODES, the oil erupting into a swirling blaze that CONSUMES the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The images break a second in the heat and light and sucking wind. Just long enough for Thomas to grab Katherine's arm and pull her out of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MINE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Katherine and Thomas lie in the dust outside the mine's tunnel entrance. Catching their breath. Trying to organize and repair the short circuits in their brains. Thomas rolls on his side, squints at the sun. Katherine's voice is faint and raspy.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What... What was that? Hell?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHERINE>
<DAGGETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...No. The voices. They were screaming and fighting over... theology. They don't sweat much about that in hell. But they do in... heaven.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAGGETT>
<DIRECTION>
He squeezes a handful of dirt in his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DAGGETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The son of a bitch. He carries it around with him like a photo album. A big, greasy cloud wherever he goes. They all do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAGGETT>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How can that be heaven? Jesus Christ. How? I don't even believe in heaven.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
The tears start rolling down her face. She looks up and shouts at the endless sky above them.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You dumb fucking assholes! How could you have done that!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHERINE>
<DAGGETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That extra chapter by St. John was right. It's a war... Just like the first one. Just like when the angel Michael beat Lucifer and cast him out. Only now they've turned on each other... Turned on each other in a civil war over theology.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAGGETT>
<DIRECTION>
He laughs hopelessly at the insanity of it all.
</DIRECTION>
<DAGGETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh sweet God, theology.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(sighs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

	How do you know know so much about that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHERINE>
<DAGGETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just know.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(shakes his head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes folks, the good news is that there's life after death in heaven. The bad news is that it's as screwed up as here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAGGETT>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They were like us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHERINE>
<DAGGETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They are us. Aborted children. And they need us. They need our corrupt, dark souls for their fight. They need...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAGGETT>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Mary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
Katherine climbs abruptly to her feet and walks for the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DAGGETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAGGETT>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know what this is. I don't know what I believe. I don't know if my sanity is lying back in that cave flopping around waiting for me. But I know one thing. Those... Those things aren't taking her!

INT. THOMAS'S CAR

<DIRECTION>
Katherine and Thomas drive along in silence. Finally,
</DIRECTION>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In those... visions... did you ever see... God?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHERINE>
<DAGGETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.

Katherine and Thomas open the trailer door and enter cautiously.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mary?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
Thomas looks out the window and notices for the first time, parked behind the trailer, Gabriel's rambler. He immediately pulls out his pistol, runs for the closed door at the end of the hall and KICKS it in. The door FLIES open, revealing Gabriel sitting on the bed beside Mary.
</DIRECTION>
<DAGGETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get away from her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAGGETT>
<DIRECTION>
His gun's leveled at Gabriel's head. The angel sits there impassively, then smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know. Son of a bitch, the priest wanna-be actually figured it out. That's a rare club, son. At least down here.

	Back away from the kid, man. Now.

	She won't feel anything, honest. I'll have to tear her apart of course -- just the way it goes -- but it'll be all right in the end. A good catholic boy like you, Mr. Daggett, you should be on my side.

Jerry suddenly LEAPS out from behind the door and TACKLES Thomas to the carpet. The gun skitters to one side as Jerry SINKS his rotting teeth into Thomas's shoulder. Thomas cries out and SLAMS his fist against Jerry's head, knocking off an ear.

Gabriel turns back to Mary's frightened face and smiles as he runs a hand through her hair.

Katherine suddenly HAMMERS Gabriel across the side of the head with a chair, KNOCKING him to the floor. As he gets up she HITS him again.

Thomas manages to bring his leg up and KICKS Jerry hard against the chest, forcing him off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel GRABS both of Katherine's legs and PULLS, CRASHING her flat on her back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thomas scrambles for his gun, grabs it, and as Jerry comes at him again spins and FIRES twice. The slugs RIP into Jerry's chest and knock him to his knees. As the putrid, curdled juices pump lumpily out of him, Jerry looks up at Thomas and smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks man, I appreciate it. You're a sport.

<DIRECTION>
Thomas FIRES a slug into his forehead. Jerry's brain winks out as he collapses to the floor, dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thomas's gun is abruptly WRENCHED from his hand onto the bed as Gabriel NAILS him with a thrown lamp, vaults the bed between them, and grabs him by the collar, SLAMMING Thomas up against the wall. He looks down at Jerry's finally lifeless corpse, incensed at Thomas's handiwork.

Gabriel walks over to the bed. The moment he gets close, Mary lifts Thomas's pistol up from the sheets and SHOOTS him twice, the impact KNOCKING him on his ass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Katherine rushes to Mary, scoops her up and runs for the door. She pauses beside Thomas, still lying in the wreckage of the table.

Katherine disappears through the bedroom doorway.
</DIRECTION>

Gabriel spins around and stands. Thomas leaps from a ragged crouch, HITTING Gabriel low with a body-block.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's like butting concrete.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel picks up Thomas by the scruff of the neck and HEAVES him THROUGH the flimsy room paneling. Thomas CRASHES with a mass of splinters into the kitchen. He stumbles backward hopelessly as Gabriel peruses him through the trailer. He desperately throws pots, glasses, anything at Gabriel. Finally trapped, he scrambles up onto the dinner table, SCATTERING salt and sugar bowls, and DIVES through the levored window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thomas, in a hail of shattered glass, smacks the red earth, pulls himself up to his knees and tries to stumble and crawl away as Gabriel BANGS open the trailer door and stomps down the stairs toward Katherine, her arms around Mary.

Katherine lifts Thomas's pistol and FIRES. Again. Again. The slugs BANG off the corregated metal, SMASH a window, KICK up some dust,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And PUNCTURE the propane tank beneath the trailer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- WUMPP-BAM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The entire trailer EXPLODES in a fiery cloud of TWISTING METAL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Katherine huddles Mary close to the ground as flaming chunks WHACK everywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel is HAMMERED to the earth and disappears in the rolling fire cloud. Thomas, further away, is KNOCKED head-over-heels in the ruddy dust.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fire cloud dissipates quickly into the sky, leaving behind scorched brush, and little else, crackling softly. Gabriel's body looks blackened and still. Katherine rushes to Thomas, who's pulled himself up to his knees, a ragged slice above his eye bleeding badly. She helps him to his feet and over to the pickup, where he sits down against the tire as Katherine pulls out her first aid kit. Mary's there, standing with her shaken grandmother.

They lock eyes. Then Katherine without a word helps Thomas up into the passenger side of the pickup. Mary gathers her grandmother into the pickup's bed and climbs up beside her as Katherine starts the engine. The firemen turn in confusion as the truck peels out of the lot and up onto the road.

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Katherine's truck shoots by. Just before town, near the copper mine, it slows down at a junction.

And there, lying on its side down the embankment, is the sheriff's patrol car. A single, bent tire turns aimlessly.

Katherine hits the gas and takes the junction that leads away from town, out onto the endless expanse of the plateau.

A trading post with a few pumps, growing orange in the weakening afternoon light. A scruffy dog barks constantly as the teenage Indian sticks the nozzle in Katherine's pickup. Still glassy-eyed with throbbing pain, Thomas takes another handful of aspirin and climbs out of the cab.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a tiny, weatherbeaten church across the weedy lot from the trading post with a pay phone bolted to it. Thomas crunches across the lot, picks up the receiver, and punches in some numbers.

INT. CHURCH

Thomas steps inside. It's empty and there's some doubt whether it's been used in a generation. The pews are dusty and scraped, some broken down completely. Thomas sits in one and looks across the space and dust and years to the crucifix hanging behind the altar.
</DIRECTION>
<DAGGETT>

Higher and higher the truck climbs on the rutted and treacherous path, till at last it crests the ridge and comes upon

THE VILLAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Perched frighteningly on the leading edge of Old Woman Butte, this is the home of the Bitter Sky Clan. The village is a small grouping of ancient adobe walled hogans first built a thousand years ago by the Anasazi. There's no electricity here, no TV antennas or frozen yogurt. Just the slow curl of cooking fires drifting up through smoke holes and the stern, deeply lined face of an old Navaho man approaching the pickup as Katherine stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The old man wears jeans, a bright maroon silk shirt, and a black felt reservation hat with a turkey feather. He holds in his right hand a small leather case.

Several villagers approach and greet Mary and her grandmother, some nodding politely to Thomas and Katherine as they climb out of the cab. Nearly all of them are elderly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thomas, one eye still half-shut by a bandage, walks over to the village's edge where a short stone wall, and little else, separates the adobe homes from the long, 2000 foot drop to the desert floor. He leans against it and gazes out on a view that must encompass half the world. In all directions, for tens upon tens of miles, there are only volcanic spires and crumbling buttes, all reduced from up here to short, ominous playthings. A village truly alone in the world.

Night creeps over the Chuska Mountains across the crusty caliche flats and over the village, pushing back the dying day to a thin, fading blue line etched across the horizon. As the darkness settles on the hogans we see a glimmer of light from within and the rising, guttural chants of the yataalii.

Under the village, beneath the surface of the butte, is the large communal kiva room. Accessible by a single ladder through a single smoke hole, it is down here that the village performs its Enemy Ghost Way for Mary.

The little girl is there, attended by her grandmother, sitting stoically still on a blanket as Grey Horse, grasping his painted prayer sticks, by the glow of a fire chants the Enemy Ghost Way cure. Katherine's eyes sting in the smokey air as she watches Grey Horse take from his case small handfulls of colored sand that he pours in fine patterns onto the floor.

Katherine wanders along the edge of the village, turning up her collar under a blinding mass of stars. There's nothing beyond the village. Not a light, not a sound. Say the wind. It is the icy brush of wind on her body that now whispers.

Perched on the wall behind her in a low crouch is a figure clad entirely in layers of black. Its head and hands are hairless and waxy white. There are eyes in this winged head, but blood chilling ones of putrid yellow. There are endless scars and shapes and wrinkles, but mostly, only, there are the eyes.

<DAGGETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The other night, you were talking about waiting for a voice to call you to something. Well, let me tell you, the worst thing that can happen to you is to be called to something. Since I can remember a voice from somewhere deep in the Church called me. So loud and so often that by thirteen I knew I was going to be a priest. You know what that's like? My parents, friends, all of them thought I was crazy. But see, I had this voice. The voice that kept coaxing me along, telling me there was a reason. So I entered the seminary and was half way to my starched white collar when my mother, father, and my little brother were wiped out in a car crash.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAGGETT>
<DIRECTION>
He pauses, the old emotions creeping back up on him.
</DIRECTION>
<DAGGETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had never asked anything of the voice. Not when the neighborhood kids made fun of me, not when my father looked down at me like some knock-kneed faggot. I never questioned a damn thing. But on the morning I spent looking down at three parallel graves, I asked it one question. Why. Why were these people taken from me? And the voice, that same voice that would wrench me out of my sleep some nights with its jabbering, it was suddenly stone silent. It was the only question I ever asked of it and it just left me hanging in the fucking wind...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAGGETT>
<DIRECTION>
He blinks back the tears welling in his eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DAGGETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So after that I traded in priest school for homicide school. Because if God wouldn't talk to me the devil sure as hell would, and his ways were a lot easier to understand.

John's eyes open wide in shock. Gabriel's skin is blackened and blistered in parts. Whole shards of his shirt are missing. John tries to sit up but Gabriel forces his head back down with his palm. With the ease of a spider he slides down and beside John.

A HOSPITAL CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the end of it is the intensive care unit, that institutional purgatory where a small handful of patients, wired and tubed and oxygenated, lay inconclusively between life and death. There's a nurse's station there, all health status video screens and a single nurse that looks up from her work at Gabriel.

	Go to sleep.

The nurse slides out of her chair and collapses to the floor. Gabriel pulls out the metal clipboards holding each patient's chart and flips through them, tossing one after another aside as unsuitable.

Satisfied, he steps over to one of the beds, pulls back the curtain and sits down beside an unconscious, middle-aged woman. He watches patiently, listening the beeping scrawl of the EKG above her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It was weak to begin with but now it's faltering badly, becoming the unsynched etchings of a child. A beeping alarm has begun to ring and her breathing is slowing to nothing. At the last possible moment Gabriel places his fingers across her face, whispering to her, coaxing her.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa, not just yet. Come on back. That's it...

The EKG's still flat but the woman is breathing. She begins to choke, to cough, then suddenly sits up and opens her eyes. She looks in disbelief around her, finally settling on Gabriel's grin.

He finishes it. Cranes his neck.

The sky thinning into uneasy pastels as the sun falls unceremoniously toward the mountains. A few lanterns have been lit, and from inside the kiva can be heard the chants of the Navaho Enemy Ghost Way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Katherine's eyes are still on a horizon dropping off into shadow. She stiffens. There, at the end of the earth, appears a silent plume of dust. It could be anybody's car, but it can only be one car. Thomas steps up beside her.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's coming.
	</DIALOGUE>

Thomas sticks his head into the kiva, speaks softly to one of the elderly villagers attending the ceremony.

<DIRECTION>
A fire has been built on the kiva's floor. Through the choking smoke can be seen Mary lying on a mat as Grey Horse chants to the yei spirits and adds fine colored earth to the growing sand painting beside her. His voice rises and falls in guttural syntax. He's coaxing. Coaxing the alien spirit out of the child.
</DIRECTION>
<DAGGETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lock the door.

He pulls his head out and hands Katherine the pistol.

There's a pause and for a moment their eyes lock. She touches his arm, almost says something, then disappears into the kiva. Thomas closes the door behind her. He turns and looks out at the distant plume of dust. Growing closer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GABRIEL'S RAMBLER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Radio turned up, sophomoric grin glued on his face, Gabriel roars past and begins the snaking climb up the side of the butte. The sun has almost completely slipped away now, leaving the land a deathly bluish grey.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The road flattens out at the top of the butte and Gabriel can see the village glowing at the far end. He punches the rambler, winding it up for the last stretch, and pats the blonde on the knee.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll like this, Rachael.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Maybe not.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a sudden glint of metal in the headlights as Thomas at the last moment PULLS UP the heavy chain and HOOKS it over the far post. Gabriel does something pointless with the brakes and SLAMS forward into it. The whole rear of the car STANDS UP on impact, PITCHING Gabriel through the windshield into the dust.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thomas steps out from behind the post armed with an iron bar. The rambler hisses and belches a death rattle as he cautiously walks toward the spot of gloom where Gabriel lies.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>

	You ought to come work for us. Upstairs. We sneak the odd civilian in now and then, you know. You'd like it. Nobody tells you when to go to bed, can eat all the ice cream you want. And you get to kill. All day and all night. Just like an angel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Thomas doesn't answer. Gabriel's body looks ravaged as he carefully steps closer and closer.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Save yourself, friend. Why go to the wall with the bitch and her rug rat? It'll all turn out the same anyway. Here or in heaven, we're still gonna tear the kid apart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DAGGETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not an angel, heaven or hell. I'm a man you eyeless puke, which means I have one thing you never will. A soul. And though I may, somewhere inside, believe in a God, I will never, never, believe in you.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay pal, have it your way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel's legs suddenly SWING AROUND and SMACK Thomas, sprawling him back into the dirt. The iron bar goes flying as Gabriel in a flash is on top of him. Thomas thrashes but Gabriel easily pins his shoulders and sits on his chest. Without hurry he uncurls the fingers of his right hand.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is going to really, really hurt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Thomas's eyes are wild with fear.
</DIRECTION>
<DAGGETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...You -- your war...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAGGETT>

Gabriel's spread fingers lower themselves toward his face.

<GABRIEL>

<DAGGETT>

<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're wrong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DAGGETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then prove it to me, Gabriel. I studied three fucking years of theology before I picked up a gun. C'mon, you're chief goddamn angel, I'm just a little man. Prove to me Christ is just a son and less than God. Prove it!

Gabriel hesitates.

<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel's becoming unglued.
</DIRECTION>
<DAGGETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you wanted to know so badly, Gabriel, why didn't you just ask Him? Why didn't you just ask God?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAGGETT>
<DIRECTION>
A shudder passes through Gabriel. He straightens up and looks down at Thomas as emotion racks his body.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because He doesn't talk to us anymore!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
The two stare at one another. Then Gabriel, lost in himself, suddenly turns away from Thomas and walks into the darkness. For the village.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thomas climbs quickly to his feet, spins around --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- And is HIT full-force by a rabid, SHRIEKING Rachael. Her legs lock around his body vise-like as her teeth and nails DIG into his skin. He cries out and stumbles to the ground. The two grapple furiously in the dust, Rachel's crazed face taking BITE after BITE out of his shoulder and neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thomas manages a fistfull of her hair and YANKS the fangs off his shoulder. With his other arm he CUFFS her hard, BREAKING the grip and ROLLING her aside. He staggers to his knees and begins to run. Shrieking, a mad porcelain banshee out of the dusk, Rachael catches up and TACKLES him. On the way down his head strikes a small stone wall and the pain is white thunder. Gagging and weeping in blank shock, he crawls on his hands and knees as Rachael OPENS UP his arm from shoulder to elbow with her nails. As the blood tumbles like ribbons, Rachael JUMPS onto his back, DIGGING her claws into his scalp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's about all one human can take.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mad with pain and anger and desperation, Thomas manages to climb to a shaky crouch, Rachael still shrieking on his back. Throwing all his weight backward, he JAMS her into the short stone wall. The impact SNAPS her hold and PROPELS her over the wall --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And two thousand feet down the side of the butte.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thomas Daggett can only curl up into a ball, gulping shallow, shuddering breaths.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE VILLAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel walks resolutely up to the first hogan and KICKS down the plank wood door. No one home. He walks to the second and KICKS its door down. Nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE KIVA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mary's ceremony is nearing a crescendo. Grey Horse has donned the colorful mask of the yei god Monster Slayer as the relatives now join in the guttural chants of the Enemy Ghost Way. Through the thick, choking smoke of the ceremonial fire we see Katherine, nervously watching the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE DARKNESS OUTSIDE THE VILLAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thomas tries hopelessly to make his way back. Stumbling every few steps, he's beyond pain and into driven numbness. It's hopeless though. We know it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE VILLAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel KICKS down another door to another empty hogan. There's only one left. As he approaches, from within can be heard the muffled sound of chanting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THOMAS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Takes a few more fumbling steps and falls again. He reaches out to something metal for support. It's Katherine's pickup.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GABRIEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Steps up to the kiva door and KICKS it. The frame buckles but holds. He steps back a few feet, puts all his weight into a turn, and KICKS again. The door SHATTERS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wood splinters ROCKET through the smoke as Gabriel appears in the doorway. Grey Horse, everyone, freezes.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Relax folks, it's just a soul.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
From out of the smoke steps Katherine. She FIRES, one round, into Gabriel's side. The archangel is pitched against the kiva's wall, where he stays a moment before turning to Katherine.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm getting real tired of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
She stands her ground between him and the child.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go to hell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHERINE>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Heaven, darling. Heaven. At least get the zip code right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all the same, isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHERINE>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. In heaven we believe in love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what do you love, Gabriel?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
Once again, the shade of doubt holds him up. But it's quickly pushed aside for a corrupted grin. He's given up all pretense.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Cracking your skull.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
He advances on her.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's all it is for you anymore, Gabriel, isn't it? Just the killing and the burning. You don't work for God anymore. You don't fight for love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHERINE>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
And he's on her. With his left arm he brutally forces her to her knees as his right hand, palm out and fingers splayed, clamp themselves over her face. Katherine's mouth opens in a silent scream as the pain, immediate and beyond endurance, flows through her body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From somewhere outside, there's a sound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Katherine gulps chokes of agony as her very clothes begin to smolder around her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear the sound once more, closer, before --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The entire kiva wall EXPLODES INWARD as Katherine's pickup CRASHES through it. The mangled grill and hood SLAM into Gabriel from the side and SMASH him to the ground like a broken puppet. Katherine falls backward to the floor, gets up, and runs to the truck's cab. Inside sits a near catatonic Thomas. Katherine takes only a second to share a look with him before reaching back and pulling out the pickup's tire iron.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel, a shattered, broken thing, pulls himself up to his knees. The sunglasses are gone and two eyeless pits stare out at Mary, huddled in the corner. Bleeding from every pore, one arm bent back the wrong way, he crawls across the floor toward her, his voice the milky slur of a stroke victim.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God loves you, Mary!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Katherine brings the tire iron down on his skull with all her might, DRIVING him to the floor. She turns to Grey Horse, her eyes wild.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Finish it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
He, everyone, just stare. Stunned to stone.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Finish it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
Grey Horse timidly picks up his prayer stick and with a voice faltering and cracked, in the insane glare of the wrecked pickup's headlights, resumes the Enemy Ghost Way chant.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Katherine turns back to Gabriel.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
She HITS him again with the tire iron. Then lifts it high once more above her head. She's going to crush him, to implode his skull.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When a hand stops her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sort of a hand. A claw. Lucifer's. He's standing behind her, holding the raised bar still.
</DIRECTION>
<LUCIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCIFER>
<DIRECTION>
Katherine releases the bar and lets it clang to the floor. Lucifer turns to the villagers, gazing fearfully at him as they awkwardly try to finish the chant.
</DIRECTION>
<LUCIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please. Go on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCIFER>
<DIRECTION>
Lucifer's gaze falls on a deeply fucked-up Gabriel who groans at the sight of him.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh man, this just isn't my day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Lucifer kneels down beside him. Katherine instinctively starts to reach for the tire iron but the sycophant hisses a liquid, chattering warning at her.
</DIRECTION>
<LUCIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Long time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCIFER>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The world's young, man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<LUCIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And full of ambition.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCIFER>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This isn't your war.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<LUCIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I remember the last one. Michael's war.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCIFER>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You lost.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<LUCIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But lots of angels were with me. every one followed their leader out of heaven.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCIFER>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah yeah, I was there, remember?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<LUCIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Except one. Oh, he was with me all right. He hated the Eagle Scout. Envied the power He gave to His Son. But this angel never came out front during the war. And when it ended he thought maybe, maybe the Eagle Scout didn't notice. So he laid low and towed the company line till he could start his own war. It was all just jealousy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCIFER>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're dreaming.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<LUCIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But maybe He did notice. Maybe that's why I'm here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCIFER>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Stay away from me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<LUCIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've always been a part of me, Gabriel. And now it's time to come home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCIFER>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Lucifer slams Gabriel's head against the floor and pins it. As the angel thrashes furiously, Lucifer FORCES his arm into Gabriel's chest. Gabriel cries out as Lucifer PULLS his arm half out and FORCES it deeper. Again. And again. Soon Gabriel's screams become giggles, then a crazed, hysterical laughter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room goes insane. An impossible nightmare of chanting Navahos, glaring headlights, and Gabriel's echoing laughter as Lucifer pumps his chest. Laughter that rises to a kind of orgasmic cry then instantly stops as Lucifer pulls out the angel's heart,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And eats it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At that instant Grey Horse places his hand on Mary's forehead, speaks a last line, and the chant is completed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sticky, smoky, awful silence. Gabriel is a non-thing. A battered, hollow shell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bartholomew Grey Horse, his voice cracked and finished, turns to Katherine.
</DIRECTION>
<GREY_HORSE>

</DAGGETT>
<DIRECTION>
From outside the kiva suddenly comes the sound of a wounded, savage GROWL. Katherine walks to the doorway. Just outside a lone coyote is twisting in the dirt with furious agony. Abruptly its thrashings cease. The animal stands and flashes for an instant at Katherine cold yellow eyes more than animal. Then it's gone into the blackness. Forever.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns and goes back to Thomas in the cab. Bleeding to death is a real possibility for him. She pulls an old shirt out of the back and tries to makeshift a wrap for his sliced arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DAGGETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	More will come... To look for the soul...

Katherine walks over to where Mary, sweaty and shaken, sits huddled in a corner attended by Grey Horse.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you all right, pumpkin?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
Mary's voice shakes as tears roll out her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<DIRECTION>
Katherine gathers her up into her arms and holds her.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's going to be okay... We're all going to be okay...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
The chattering, hissing sycophant grabs Gabriel's body by the hair and shoulders and drags it out the door. Lucifer has remained behind, crouched on his haunches, his liquid, yellow eyes on Katherine.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't quite bring myself to say thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHERINE>
<LUCIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I understand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCIFER>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then this is done.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHERINE>
<LUCIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not necessarily. Maybe I like you. Maybe I want you to come with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCIFER>
<DIRECTION>
He rises to his feet and steps slowly toward her.
</DIRECTION>
<LUCIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You owe me, Katherine. And you're going to ask me to take you home.

(clutching Mary)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.

	You will. You will because any other way is going to be more awful than you can imagine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCIFER>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you threatening me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
Just a grinning, twisted stare.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then you've picked the wrong person this time. I've just about had it up to here with ghosts. So you can put away the horror movie sneer and the K-Mart halloween eyes, because we know you now. We know you all. And if you want to force the issue then go ahead because you're just another angel to me. Take a look at your buddy Gabriel. Then ask yourself, do you really, really want to fuck with us?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
The smallest hint of a pause.
</DIRECTION>
<LUCIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps another time.

</LUCIFER>
<KATHERINE>

	I'm holding my breath.

DISSOLVE TO:

<DIRECTION>
The fullness of day over Old Woman Butte, hot and bright. Chasing the night and its fears away under the punishing glare of noon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The village is full of police vehicles now. Green broncos from the Navaho Tribal Police. Blue and white sheriff department sedans.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Navaho cops are talking with Katherine and Mary. Thomas is sitting on the trunk of a patrol car getting his wounds properly bandaged as the Sheriff we met earlier leans beside him chewing on a wild oat stalk.
