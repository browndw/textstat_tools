	These tests were conducted over a six month period using a double-blind format of eight over-lapping demographic groups. Every region of the country was sampled, the focus testing showed a solid base in the 9 to 11-year old bracket--with a possible carry-over into the 12-year olds. When you consider that Nobots and Transformers pull over 37 percent market share, and that we are targeting the same area, I think that we should see one quarter of that and that is one fifth of the total revenue from all of last year. Any questions? Yes? Yes?

	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not ready to accept responsibility!

</SUSAN>
<JOSH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! You don't understand! I mean, I'm thirteen years old!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSH>
<SUSAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh! And who isn't? You think that there isn't a frightened kid inside of me, too!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSAN>
<JOSH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! I mean I really am thirteen! I went to bed one night and I was a kid, and when I woke up the next morning I was a grown up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSH>
<SUSAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh right! And just yesterday I was a school girl with pigtails! Why are you doing this Josh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSAN>
<JOSH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There was this carnival in New Jersey. I made a wish on this machine. It was called a Zoltar Machine...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSH>
<SUSAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh stop it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSAN>
<JOSH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was called a Zoltar Machine! It had this bobbing head that looked just like a devil and if you got a quarter in the devil's mouth you could make a wish and I did! So I made a wish to be big! That is what I'm trying to tell you! I changed into a grown up but I'm really just a kid!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSH>
<SUSAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine Josh! You're a kid! Look, I really don't know what it is that you're trying to tell me. But we have a very big presentation to give tomorrow, so I'm going to get some sleep.

	There's this flat screen inside with pictures on it and you read it. And when you get down to the bottom you have to make a choice of what the character's going to do...Like if he going to go in and fight the dragon then you have to push one of the buttons.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it's a comic book that....
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSH>
<SUSAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See, there's a computer chip inside which stores the choices, so when you reach the end of the page, you decide where the story goes. That's the point.

<MR_M>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Terrific Susan.

<MR_M>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is really possible?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_M>
<SUSAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. In fact, it's a very simple program. Isn't that right? MAN So what happens when you run out of choices?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSAN>
<SUSAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, that's the great thing. You can just sell different adventures. Just pop in a new disk and you get a whole new set of options.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSAN>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We could market this on a comic book rack.
