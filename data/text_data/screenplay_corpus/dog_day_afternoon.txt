We are SEEING HEIDI, though we don't know it yet - she's just another pretty 175-pound Italian girl with two kids, KIMMY, JIMMY, about four and five years old. Right now she is a lump of browning flesh, shining with oil among rows of similar ladies (mostly thinner, but all with a certain unhealthy softness about them) laid out in rows and groups across the sand. SHOOT LOW AND LONG, so heat shimmers rise, as though the heat were baking the oil out of this mob, visible suntan oil pollution... Heidi's transistor blasts ROCK MUSIC into the air.

INT/EXT. SONNY'S CAR - STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is parked in a drab Brooklyn street. Beside the car stands SAL, medium height, also good-looking in an intense boyish way. His eyes dart about suspiciously, the ever- watchful Sal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a watchful reserve in Sal that contrasts to Sonny's outgoing bounciness: first impression is Sonny is all bark; Sal is the bite. Sal is dressed in impressive blue suit style, he looks like a kid trying to impress the Godfather. He even wears a hat. Now, matching Sal's preparations inside the car, he checks his tie's alignment, shoots his cuffs and is ready...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile, on their car radio:
</DIRECTION>
<ELTON_JOHN>

<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE BY CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he turns, from the back of the car, JACKIE appears with a huge florist box, tied with ribbon. Jackie is an eighteen year old with bad complexion and in contrast to Sonny and Sal is dressed in teenage sloppiness. Adidas, T-shirt, bowling jacket, jeans. He is uncertain: waits for directions from Sonny. Sonny takes the florist box from him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see a water truck drive down the street, followed by Sonny's car, which drives up near bank. It stops, Jackie gets out, crosses to bank window, peers through, then
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE INSIDE CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
returns to car. Leans in, has fake conversation with Sonny. They are waiting. Sonny checks his watch, turns to Sal in back seat:
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	30 seconds, Sal...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
They wait. At appropriate moment, Sal exits car, walks toward bank. Slowly Sonny gets out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BANK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A slightly seedy little branch bank, old yellow brick, blond varnished wood, a rubber plant, an American flag. Through the windows we SEE HOWARD, the aged black bank guard, in uniform, taking down the American flag from outside. Past him comes Sal carrying an attache case. He passes Howard coming toward us through the door into the bank. As he passes CAMERA:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT: BANK CLOCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as it CLICKS from 2:57 to 2:58 PM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVING SHOT WITH SAL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as he moves toward the left-hand deposit-slips desks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He picks out a car-loan application slip, then walks toward the manager's desk (as the sign on the desk proclaims) of PATRICK MULVANEY. Sal sits down, his back to Mulvaney, facing the front door of the bank. Mulvaney is on the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Sonny bustles through in his bouncy dancer's walk. He carries the large florist box. He moves toward the left- hand deposit-slips desks, takes one out and begins to fill one out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON HOWARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as he pulls out the keys, attached to the belt of his uniform. Jackie approaches the door of the bank and stops, neither in nor out, as though he can't make up his mind. Howard watches him, waiting patiently, keys in hand, folded flag under his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE - SAL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
still sitting, back to Mulvaney, watching Jackie's approach and entrance, ready to move on cue.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
on Howard as he looks at Jackie, still half in, half out. Howard speaks to him:
</DIRECTION>
<HOWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Closing time; you want in or out?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOWARD>
<DIRECTION>
Jackie steps in and as Howard locks the door to prevent more customers from entering, Jackie walks toward Sonny, filling out a slip at the left-hand area. CAMERA FOLLOWS Jackie. He stops at deposit-slips desk, next to Sonny.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE - SAL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as if by pre-arranged signal, Sal now stands up, moves to the side of Mulvaney's desk.
</DIRECTION>
<SAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You the manager?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAL>
<DIRECTION>
ON MULVANEY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
who is still on the phone. He gestures at the sign on his desk that says so, and gestures for Sal to sit down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON SAL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as he sits, producing as he does a machine pistol, which he holds on Mulvaney's chest, out of sight from others in the bank.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MULVANEY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His mouth simply stops, and he stares at the gun. Mulvaney is a comic opera Irishman in his early fifties, florid ... cheerful, bushy eyebrows; he acts out everything he says...
</DIRECTION>
<SAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just go on talking, like nothing was happening, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAL>
<MULVANEY>
<DIRECTION>
(into phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, lemme call you back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULVANEY>
<DIRECTION>
He hangs up, and looks from the gun up to Sal's blank hard face. To his own amazement, he grins: a hopeful grin that says: "Like me - don't hurt me." And he's embarrassed by it. As we watch, his smile turns sour.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS POV - FLASH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sal's absolutely unmoved face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO SHOT - SONNY AND JACKIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jackie moves over to Sonny.
</DIRECTION>
<JACKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sonny, I'm gettin' real bad vibes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACKIE>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jackie - what are you talking about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<JACKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe we can take something smaller... like a Spanish grocery.

</JACKIE>
<SONNY>

(indicating what's

and Mulvaney)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's too late - just get away from me - don't talk to me now - go over to your place...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
Jackie moves to another deposit-slips desk - takes one out and begins to fill it out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON TELLER'S CAGE AREA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as a LADY with a BABY in a stroller moves away from the Teller and starts to walk toward the front door. DEBORAH is marking figures on a piece of paper at 1st Teller's cage. SYLVIA and MIRIAM stand behind her - their backs to Sonny. Howard, who has put the folded flag in a plastic bag in a front desk, follows Lady toward the door. He unlocks the door and hands the Baby a lollipop, courtesy of the bank, and she exits the bank.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE - NEW ANGLE - SONNY

glancing at clock, taking a sharp deep breath...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAL

staring at Mulvaney.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MULVANEY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the ruins of his smile still on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HOWARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
straightens up from locking the door; the figure of the Lady and the Baby can be seen receding outside...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SONNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
seeing that the bank is closed, locked in, with no customers, crosses toward the front teller's cage area, carrying the florist box. As he reaches the other side, he rips open the box and takes the rifle out and aims it level onto SYLVIA BALL, the teller, who automatically takes the "closed" sign and holds it in front of her face as though to protect herself from the rifle.
</DIRECTION>
<SYLVIA>

(holding sign in front of her face)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, this window is shut...

as Mulvaney stands and yells to Sylvia...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON BACK OF BANK, REST ROOM AREA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as MARGARET, an accountant, comes out of the ladies' room, starts to cross downstage toward her desk, sees what is happening, and momentarily freezes in her tracks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SONNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cues have got all fucked up, but he's so programmed and ready, he can't adjust, so the speech he had ready comes out now:
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, this is a stickup! Nobody move! This is a fucking stickup! Just freeze now, goddammit! Get away from your desk... get in the center - get in the center!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
Sylvia and Edna start to move toward the rear of the bank, toward Margaret's desk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MULVANEY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
aghast at his own outspokenness ... Sal holding the gun levelled on him.
</DIRECTION>
<MULVANEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, okay... we know it's a stickup!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULVANEY>
<SONNY>

	<DIALOGUE>
	If he moves - blow his guts out... Cover him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
TWO SHOT - SONNY & JACKIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jackie, staring at the real guns, turns to Sonny...
</DIRECTION>
<JACKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, Sonny... I can't make it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACKIE>
<DIRECTION>
Jackie starts to move toward the front door.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, for christ's sake... now... fuckin' asshole...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turns to Sal)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He can't make it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<SAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck him - let him out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAL>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny yells out at frozen Howard.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey... let him out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<MULVANEY>
<DIRECTION>
(yells)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do what the gentleman says, Howard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULVANEY>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny sees that Howard is useless, so he runs to Howard, grabbing the keys from him and pulls Howard along with him to the front door. Jackie unlocks the door, and Jackie, with a last apologetic glance, gives his gun to Sonny and vanishes into the sweltering afternoon. Sonny then frisks Howard and has a sudden afterthought as he locks the door again. He quickly unlocks it and shouts out at Jackie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BANK - DAY

	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, don't take the car!

</SONNY>
<JACKIE>
<DIRECTION>
(on sidewalk)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, how'll I get home?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACKIE>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take the subway. We need the car.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as Jackie starts to walk away)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, gimme the keys - the keys!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
Jackie stops, fumbles for keys, crosses back to Sonny with them.
</DIRECTION>
<JACKIE>
<DIRECTION>
(points to fig. desk)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sonny, there's somebody under that desk over there... I'm sorry...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACKIE>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay... it's okay...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny turns into the bank once more, as Jackie walks off toward the subway, pointing inside at a desk near the window as he does, to point something out to Sonny.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BANK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny, re-entering the bank, speaks to Howard.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lock it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny now crosses to desk that Jackie indicated, as everyone watches him, as though it's all in the game.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
(taps loudly on top of desk)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey... get outta there! Nobody's gonna hurt you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
JENNY, a young, frightened girl, peeks out from under the desk, obviously afraid to reveal herself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny starts to move toward the front of the bank. Sal turns so he can cover everyone. Sonny turns to order Howard.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pull the drapes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
Howard doesn't move.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pulla drapes!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
Howard belatedly leaps to work, pulling drapes that screen off the interior from outside. The door has no drapes or blinds and thus when the drapes are closed there is a corridor of space across the street we will always be able to see. And from which people outside will always be able to see in. As Howard finishes the task, he then walks back to the huddled group on the rear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SONNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
on his way to the back of the bank, is digging into his jacket pocket; he swings around as he passes the camera that is bolted to a wall bracket covering the tellers' area. He whips out a spray can and gives the lens a shot of red paint. There are three cameras in all, each of which he sprays.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
(grinning)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No replay, folks... no alarms...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
After spraying the three cameras, he has reached Mulvaney's desk area. The girls are scattering to group farther back and Sonny and Mulvaney are heading for the vault.
</DIRECTION>
<MULVANEY>
<DIRECTION>
(on cross to vault with Sonny)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're hip... let's just get you all fixed up and on your way!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULVANEY>
<DIRECTION>
MIRIAM, a young, awkward, overweight Jewish girl, chewing gum with nervous machine-like rapidity, moving toward the vault. The gate is closed, and she holds one key and Mulvaney the other. They pass Sal, who now holds the others in the bank under his gun while at the vault gate.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, is the vault open?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<MULVANEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can take care of that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULVANEY>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mulvaney is about to insert his key in his lock. Sonny quickly reaches out and grabs Mulvaney's hand, and looks at the key he has extended. He explodes.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Son of a bitch!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
He almost hits Mulvaney with his fist.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the fuck you tryin' to do? Trip the alarm? Use the spur key? Use the other one...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
He's grabbed the keys from Mulvaney and holds up the key Mulvaney was going to use... we're in a:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VERY TIGHT TWO SHOT - MULVANEY AND SONNY'S HEADS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny holds the key right in the middle of the FRAME where Mulvaney and the audience can SEE the key has a tiny projection or spur at the end. If this key is used, the spur triggers a silent alarm.
</DIRECTION>
<MULVANEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I must of been outta my mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULVANEY>
<SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
(furious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you get your mind right. I'm a Catholic and I don't wanna hurt nobody, but goddamn it, don't you play no games with me. Unnastand?!?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
Mulvaney nods and picks out a key that is identical except for the spur. He shows it to Sonny. Sonny nods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Mulvaney carefully uses the safe key to unlock the gate. Miriam is crying as she unlocks her side. The gate swings open. Sonny shoves Mulvaney inside and, as he passes Miriam, notices her tears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She just stands there staring into his face like a hypnotized chicken, the tears streaming down her face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny stops, staring at her. Mulvaney, starting to open the gate, moves inside the vault, impatient...
</DIRECTION>
<MULVANEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Let's get you on your way. Miriam - open the safe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULVANEY>
<DIRECTION>
Miriam hesitates.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the matter with you?

</SONNY>
<MULVANEY>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, lemme load you up...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULVANEY>
<MIRIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There isn't any money...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRIAM>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny looks at Mulvaney, alarmed...
</DIRECTION>
<MIRIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They picked it up this afternoon...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRIAM>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No money?!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(moves inside the vault)
</DIRECTION>
<MIRIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's only about four thousand in singles, and maybe a few hundred in larger bills... he's going to kill us!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRIAM>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny storms into the vault.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE IN VAULT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Mulvaney pulls a cash drawer out to show Sonny: even we can see there isn't much there. Sonny searches for more, finds nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is it? What am I gonna do with this? Holy shit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<MULVANEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all we got.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULVANEY>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, don't worry about it. Stick it in the bag...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
At this, Sonny pulls out a plastic bag from his pocket, hands it to Miriam, who opens it and puts the money into it. As he turns, we see that Miriam is still staring at him, terrified, and as his rifle swings around, she reels back with a little screech of terror...

<MULVANEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's afraid you're gonna shoot...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(hands Sonny the bag of money)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny starts out of the vault toward the teller's area with bag of money. He speaks to Mulvaney.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell would I shoot her for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
Miriam follows Sonny to teller's cages gate. He carries the bag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PHONE STARTS TO RING (#1)
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Answer the phone!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
Mulvaney crosses to his desk, picks up the receiver. Sal follows him, yanks receiver from one ear to the other, so he can hear conversation.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
(to Miriam)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay... open this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
Miriam crosses to gate, presses the necessary button and the gate opens from them. Sonny watches this carefully, noting where the buzzer button is. He crosses in front of the drawer at the first cage. He tries to open the drawer. It's obviously locked.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, who's the head teller here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<SYLVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>

</SYLVIA>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>

Sylvia comes forward and unlocks the first drawer, and begins to remove the cash, but Sonny grabs her hands... alarmed...
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't take it all out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs a piece of paper or cardboard...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - SONNY'S HANDS AND CASH IN DRAWER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes all the singles but one out of the singles slot in the drawer, leaving the bottom single in place. It is held there by a metal clip. He carefully slips the paper under the clip and then removes the single.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is clear this is an automatic alarm - meanwhile...
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boy, I can't trust a one of you... I worked in a bank, I know the alarms, so don't try to fool around with me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SHOT OF SONNY AND SYLVIA AND MIRIAM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as they move to 2nd cash drawer at 2nd teller's cage. Sylvia unlocks the drawer and starts to reach in for the cash, but Sonny pushes his hand into the drawer instead. He begins to stuff the money into the bag. Some fives, packaged with rubber bands, in the drawer, he holds up so Sal and all can see them... He laughs!
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Decoy money, right, it's marked! Shit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
He throws it into the air so the bills flutter all around him, gaily... In the background, Mulvaney, having finished with the phone conversation, is moving to the rear with the rest of the girls. Sonny now moves to the 3rd cage's cash drawer... Mulvaney ends phone conversation and Sal moves him over to group at vault.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
(mimicking Sylvia)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'This window is shut...'

Again, the same procedure begins. Sylvia unlocks the cash drawer and Sonny starts to scoop it out and put it into the opened plastic bag that Miriam holds.

At this point, THE PHONE BEGINS TO RING AGAIN (#2)
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
(yelling to Sal)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sal, let him answer the goddamn phones, they're driving me crazy! Look at this chicken shit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
Again, Mulvaney starts to cross back to his desk, again followed by Sal. Sonny yells out to Mulvaney as he crosses to answer the phone.

	Hey, you, manager... Don't get any ideas, fucker... See that man there? I bark and he bites!

MULVANEY ON THE PHONE
</DIRECTION>
<MULVANEY>

	Hello... I'm sorry I can't talk to you right now... I suggest you call during banking hours tomorrow. What is your name?

</MULVANEY>
<DIRECTION>
BACK ON SONNY, SYLVIA AND MIRIAM
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gimme the traveler's checks and the register.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
They cross toward the last drawer area (#5). Miriam is still crying silently. Sonny holds out the plastic bag for the checks for her. She drops it.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please... quit that. It's not necessary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
With everything in the bag, Sonny now takes the register and starts to move the two girls toward the rear near the vault.
</DIRECTION>
<MULVANEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you hurry it up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULVANEY>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SONNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as he moves toward the rear (Sylvia and Miriam now re- joining other women), to get a wastebasket. Accomplishing this, he starts to burn the pages of the register, tearing out pages as he does so. It's smokey as hell, but not burning well. He drops it, smoking, into the wastebasket.
</DIRECTION>

<HOWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOWARD>
<DIRECTION>
ON HOWARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The old man is panicked, great patches of sweat spreading around his armpits. He breathes in asthmatic gasps; now he flinches at his name, as though he's been hit.
</DIRECTION>
<MULVANEY>
<DIRECTION>
(stands, receiver
</DIRECTION>
<still_to_ear_then>

</MULVANEY>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gimme the keys to get outta here!

</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
Howard is unable to move. Seeing his predicament, Edna moves to him and starts to unfasten his belt to remove the keys. Mulvaney continues with his phone conversation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON SONNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
who now crosses to Howard and Edna, losing patience with the situation. As he moves closer, Howard backs away from him, frightened by his rifle. Seeing that, Sonny puts it down and looks over to Sal for coverage.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sal...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
As Sonny approaches Howard, he realizes that he can't get close enough.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take it easy... just gimme the keys. I'm not gonna hurt you. Listen, calm down, huh? You're gonna have a heart attack. Just gimme the keys... that's all I want.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
Howard gives him the keys and as Sonny starts to walk back toward the burning register...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON SAL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
with Mulvaney still on the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<SAL>
<DIRECTION>
(looking past camera,
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sonny... who's that? Across the street.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAL>
<DIRECTION>
ON SONNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
who now starts to move quickly toward the front of the bank, being sure to hide behind the posts as he moves.
</DIRECTION>
<MULVANEY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) (on phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it was the credit rating. The credit rating. I don't know, you;d have to find that out from him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULVANEY>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny has now reached the front of the bank. He carefully peeks out through the closed draperies to look outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON STREET - SONNY'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A man, in a business suit, sweaty and harassed-looking, is walking from an insurance office across the street directly toward the bank... The man continues coming straight toward them and us...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny starts to run back to get his gun from Margaret's desk. Mulvaney is still on the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<MULVANEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was something a couple of years ago in St. Louis, I don't know...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULVANEY>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny grabs the gun from the desk top and moves over to Mulvaney.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON DOOR AT FRONT OF BANK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man walks straight toward the glass door, already lifting his hand to shadow his eyes, so when he reaches the door, he'll be able to see inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE ON SAL AND MULVANEY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sal brings the gun up so he can shoot the man, at the same time, crabbing himself aside so he is concealed behind Mulvaney and the desk. Mulvaney sees the approaching man and cups his hand over the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<MULVANEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the insurance guy across the street. He probably saw the goddamn smoke!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please! Put out the fire!

<DIRECTION>
The last few feet from the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON SONNY
</DIRECTION>

who rushes through the teller's cages gate toward the register, grabs the smoking register, throws it onto the floor near Edna's desk, and starts to stamp it out.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll get some water!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET>
<DIRECTION>
Before anyone can move, Sonny grabs the gun on them all.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nobody move! Freeze!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
The women now begin to scream as real hysteria sets in. Deborah screams, collapses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE - ON SAL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
bringing gun up on:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man actually kicks the glass with his foot, then leans against the glass, shades his eyes, trying to see in.
</DIRECTION>
<MULVANEY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry... I can't talk now... I'll call you back.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA FOLLOWS MULVANEY TO THE FRONT DOOR; Sonny moves with him, covering him all the time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON FRONT DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Sonny stands behind closed venetian blinds to listen to the conversation and to cover Mulvaney.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The gun's right on your back...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<MULVANEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give me the keys...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULVANEY>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny hands him the keys.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VERY CLOSE SHOT - SAL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He raises the gun and sights it now, and in this moment, we should sense a kind of luxurious relaxation into anticipation on Sal's part. He is smiling a little, and for the first time, looks happy, and that's what makes him seem dangerous. He's looking forward to an excuse to kill. It's here now: survival. There is something almost sexual about the way he settles his body down behind the weapon, getting ready for the squeeze on the trigger, the report, the violent shove of recoil against his muscles and sinews.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the background, we see Sylvia bringing Howard a cup of water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
emphasizing the small of Mulvaney's back. The man is somebody he knows from across the street. He looks worried and mystified...
</DIRECTION>

<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.

</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
He's not satisfied, but he can't see anything and he can't think of anything more to say, so...
</DIRECTION>
<MULVANEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks again, Sam.

Mulvaney locks the door and walks inside the bank, giving the keys back to Sonny.

<MULVANEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For God's sake, will you please go now? We gave you every nickel we got.

	You're goin' outside with me. If there's no cops around, we just split. Otherwise, you go with us.

Mulvaney and Sonny starts to walk back toward Sal. As they do, the PHONE BEGINS TO RING AGAIN (#3).
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Answer it.

	</DIALOGUE>
</SAL>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get 'em in the vault!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
As Sal starts to herd them into the vault (Sylvia helping Howard, still with the cup of water), Mulvaney is still on the phone. Sonny moves down to get the money bag atop the teller's cages and we hear Mulvaney on phone.
</DIRECTION>
<MULVANEY>
<DIRECTION>
(tired)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What property is that, Mrs. Anterio? The Third Avenue property - you already got a second mortgage on. We discussed it before...

</MULVANEY>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE AT VAULT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The girls are afraid; Miriam unlocks the gate as Sonny uses Mulvaney's keys to the matching lock.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNY>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You won't close the vault? How can we breathe?

<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, that's okay... just close the gate...

Sylvia, helping Howard, is the last to go through the gate. As Sonny is about to lock the gate, she turns to him.
</DIRECTION>
<SYLVIA>

	Listen, I'll never make it. I'll have to go to the toilet.
	</DIALOGUE>

	What's the matter... they never housebroke you?

</EDNA>
<SAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see... now they all gotta go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAL>
<DIRECTION>
As Sylvia starts to move out, Sonny starts to cross ahead of her.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a minute - I want to check.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
Mulvaney finishes his phone conversation. He moves toward the group at the vault.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Sonny sprints for the door to the Ladies' Room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE LADIES' ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a little lounge; sitting on a couch under the window, making up her face (or painting her toenails) and listening to her tiny transistor radio, oblivious to all that's happened, is MARIA, heavily-painted and voluptuous Latin girl. Sylvia, following him in, is shocked. She's forgotten about Maria. Now she runs over to her, puts her arms around her.
</DIRECTION>
<SYLVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh - Maria!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SYLVIA>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who the hell is that? God damn it! What the...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>

Maria is about to protest, but Sylvia grabs her and starts to hustle her out.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you trying to pull?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<SYLVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I forgot she's in here.

</SYLVIA>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, nobody's going to the bathroom - come on...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
He moves with them back to the vault area, herds them into it. At this point, PHONE RINGS AGAIN (#4). Sonny moves to get the empty wastebasket, shoving it into the vault for the girls to use in case of emergency. Mulvaney moves to his desk and phone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mulvaney has by this time answered the phone, and is now holding it out to Sonny. HOLD THE BEAT...
</DIRECTION>
<MULVANEY>
<DIRECTION>
(to Sonny)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULVANEY>
<DIRECTION>
ON SONNY AND SAL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They both stare at Mulvaney. Sonny slowly moves toward Mulvaney. For the first time since he entered the bank, he's quiet and slow. He takes the instrument and slowly puts it to his ear. The group from the vault now slowly starts to move out to listen to the conversation.
</DIRECTION>

<SAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAL>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny turns and looks out through the door. Sure enough, in the window of the barbershop across the street, the dim figure of a man on a telephone can be SEEN looking out toward us. He wears a hat in spite of the weather and a cigar is clamped in his mouth. He is an old-time, hard- nosed, uneducated, street-wise, sarcastic New York cop, outspoken, rude and sentimental. Right now he's a distant silhouette and a voice on the telephone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON SONNY

	Okay? Let's be reasonable and not stupid and not get anybody hurt. You come to the front door with hands folded on your head, unnastand? Nobody's gonna shoot or...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORETTI>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny slowly, almost sadly, puts the telephone receiver back down, cutting off the little voice at the other end. He looks up at Mulvaney, then to Sal.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>

</MULVANEY>

Sonny is pacing back and forth, trying to figure out what to do.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, shit! I gotta have time to think.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<SYLVIA>

Phone continues to ring. Sonny finally grabs it (desk opposite Mulvaney).
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, bastards! You keep away from the bank or we start throwing bodies out the front door one at a time. You got that?

A startled apologetic man's voice speaks: Now ANOTHER PHONE BEGINS TO RING (#6).
</DIRECTION>
<MAN_S_VOICE>

Sonny abruptly holds the phone out from his body at arm's length, disgusted.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is there a Jenny here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
Nobody moves. They all stare at him. Finally he singles her out.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's your husband.

Jenny starts to move toward Sonny.

OTHER PHONE CONTINUES TO RING (#6).

As he puts down the phone for her to pick up, Sonny reaches for the other phone that is RINGING.

<SONNY>

He hangs up the phone. Sal looks at him.

At this moment, Jenny, phone in hand, is turned to him, respectfully like a child in an authoritarian household, addressing her father:

stares at her. For the first time, he realizes how frightened she is, how serious, grotesque, and funny it all is. He takes the time to be tender with her, as though she were a not-too-bright child in the presence of a tragedy she'll never understand.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell him I don't know.

	What I want to say is... everything's gonna be all right... if we all cooperate and we don't, you know... carry on... I don't know you and you don't know me... and what I'm tryin' to tell you is that if you stay cooled out, we can work this thing out and nobody's going to get hurt... believe me, I don't want to hurt anybody ... Everybody is going to have a chance to do what they have to do ... she's gotta go to the bathroom - so you go - and you can go after ...

	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<MULVANEY>

At some point in their move toward the rear door, Sylvia exits the Ladies' room and moves back toward the group.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here we are ... the back door.

</MULVANEY>
<DIRECTION>
They look at it. It is big, black, steel and seems solid. Sonny tests it.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They could shoot the lock ... I want to block it, so if they try comin' here, we're gonna hear it. Here, you pull on that side.

<DIRECTION>
(puts gun aside)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He has found a big office machine, a Xerox or whatever, which he now starts to push toward the door. On the opposite side, Mulvaney starts to pull it toward the door. It's very heavy and they have to strain to budge it at all. Meanwhile:

Mulvaney has removed his suit jacket.

<MULVANEY>

Sonny laughs and pushes the machine. Mulvaney pulls from the opposite side.

<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They'll shoot you; the fucking cops'll shoot you ... they don't give a damn. In spite of that bank insurance. You see what they did in Attica, they shot everybody, the hostages, prisoners, cops, guards, forty-two people they killed, the innocent with the guilty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
They have the machine almost to the door now, with Mulvaney almost pinned between the machine and the door. He eases himself out. Looks at the gun, then at Sonny, then they shove the machine against the door. Sonny then gives Mulvaney his jacket to put on again.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyway, I'm not gonna take you. I'm gonna take one of the girls, a married one with a couple of kids. The cops don't like it in the papers when they kill a mother, especially if she's got young kids.

Finished with the task, Sonny takes his gun and with Mulvaney, they start to cross back toward Sal and the rest of the group.

EXT. (AERIAL) ANGLE FROM INT. POLICE HELICOPTER (OVER BANK)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As it banks steeply we can see past Pilot to bank, and cops around car. We see a small crowd being held back by a few police still setting up barricades. It is the first indication of the crowd event it became. It also sets the geography for us, but very quickly another copter swims into view and the two circle each other. The other copter -- only feet away -- is a TV news helicopter, with a big camera sticking out the open door on our side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is turned down by the Cameraman to focus on the bank. A COP in the police helicopter yells through his bullhorn at the TV Cameraman.
</DIRECTION>
<BULLHORN_COP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is a restricted area. You are flying in a restricted area ...

<DIRECTION>
INT. APARTMENT NEAR BANK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Though an open window a fire escape can be seen and beyond it an angle of street and the bank. Near the window in a corner is a TV set, and on the TV set we are seeing the shot of the police helicopter and the Cop yelling on the bullhorn as seen from the TV copter. A couple of Elderly Men are sitting watching the TV set, ignoring the bank, which they can see in the flesh, as it were. Outside we are HEARING the copters, and on the TV set likewise, and the voice of the Announcer.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNOUNCER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... police as yet have made no contact with the bank robbers who are locked in the bank ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNOUNCER>
<DIRECTION>
There is a HAMMERING at the door, and the men at the TV set barely have time to look around before several burly Cops wearing flak vests and helmets and carrying sniper rifles with telescopic slights move through the room, ignoring the men. They move out onto the fire escape, a couple going up higher, settling themselves down to aim in their rifles on the front of the bank. A lot of AD LIB dialogue, but what we note is the Cops, as a man, take a look at themselves on the TV.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BANK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The FRAME is full of cop faces ... tough, mesomorphic faces with a layer of fat under the skin, increasing as age. They have the look of cops: alert, curious, weighing. They are city cops; they don't have that old-fashioned condemnatory expression, there is an element of playfulness in their nature -- the fact is they love their work, which is criminals. There is a peculiar delight in ferreting out the criminal impulse in everybody, and a matching fury in punishing it -- which is the action of repressing their own strongly developed criminal unconscious. These are tense, funny, violent, and rigidly controlled men.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MORETTI is an old-line cop, a lot more relaxed than the younger men and the cold professionals of the FBI, who as a group resemble astronauts, and like them hide (but do not deny) the psychic chaos underneath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Right now they are looking at the sky. We HEAR a heavy helicopter track.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We feature SHELDON, the silver-haired FBI Agent-in-Charge, who looks like an accountant, and Moretti, with hat and cigar, and a face out of Warner Brothers movies of the Forties. In spite of Sheldon's age, Moretti plays though he's a smart kid who still needs a little help.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sheldon is getting out of a gray car, wears a gray suit. Three men with him are carbon copies of him at younger ages. The three hang around him. They approach Moretti who looks at them without moving.

Moretti looks at him, cheerfully sarcastic.

They are moving past Cops on the corner heading toward a small barbershop across the street from the bank. We now sense the growing crowd, standing quietly, just staring not yet knowing what's going on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From down the street come a group of odd-looking men in suits, carrying all kinds of electric junk: The NEW REPORTERS. They run heavily, sweating martinis and cigarette smoke ... they run up to Moretti and Sheldon, who walk along, trying not to catch an eye.

They have arrived at the barber shop where Moretti fights his way inside.

A COP is talking on the wall phone as MORETTI, BAKER, etc. are trying to get inside.
</DIRECTION>
<COP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... no, just get hold of Al, tell him to get the catering truck over to 26th and Avenue B, there's a bank robbery in progress and big crowd. Big! Tell him to bring ice cream -- I got to hang up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP>
<DIRECTION>
He hangs up and immediately begins thumbing through a POCKET PHONE BOOK. Throughout this Cop is engaged in personal business on the fringe of this affair, and though he's on duty he hardly knows what's happening on the robbery. He's trying to get his brother-in-law with the ice cream truck down here, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Moretti has got the crowd cleared back, so that now we SEE why this has been chosen as a tactical command post. From here, while talking on the phone, Moretti can see the bank, and through the uncurtained door he can even see some distance inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Moretti picks up the phone.

The group inside the bank have now been waiting approximately twelve minutes since anything last happened. Sonny is seated at Mulvaney's desk, all the phones off the hooks. The rest of the group is huddled around the vault area where Sal is keeping his eye on them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, Sonny jumps up and puts all the receivers back on the hooks, crossing back to sit at Mulvaney's desk again.

PHONE STARTS TO RING and Sonny picks it up.

	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
A cop passing by presses a portable two-way radio into Moretti's hand: He accepts it and holds as though he expected it. The Cop passes the same type of set to certain other officers. These sets are tuned in to each other, and throughout the movie, there is a constant background talk on these sets. This is police procedure; the orders are for everyone to talk about everything. If anyone has a question, has heard a rumor or a sound, whatever, it is immediately responded to, so that there can be the fewest possible surprises. Sample dialogue might go: "Did I hear a shot?" "Over here, by the bank, there was a report like a gunshot, inside." "Roger, we heard that from the barbershop ... it was inside the bank." "Barbershop, you can see inside?" "Roger, we heard from the barbershop ... it was inside the bank." "Barbershop, you can see inside?" "Roger, this is the barbershop, we see inside, the perpetrator is moving toward the rear of the bank." "Who's that guy walking through the barricade?" "The blue suit?" "Yeah." "Off- duty Inspector come down to see can you use him." Etc. They really do use the word Perpetrator, Felon, etc. The Cop handing out radios makes Moretti sign for it -- which Moretti does during the following:

</DIRECTION>
<SYLVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go along, Howard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SYLVIA>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE OUTSIDE DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Howard is pushed out the door by Sylvia, a cop from a nearby car rushes up to him and shoves him to a curbside car where he bends Howard over the car, putting his hands behind him for handcuffs and starts to frisk him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HOWARD'S POV - QUICK CUTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
About 100 weapons ranging from machine guns to hand guns to sniper rifles are whipped up and pointed straight at his chest and head. The effect is as though he is about to be blown entirely away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON THE BARBER SHOP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Moretti rushes out, screaming to the cop with Howard.
</DIRECTION>
<MORETTI>

<DIRECTION>
(Etc.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VARIOUS COPS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Confusion reigns. They don't know if the perpetrator or not, since they haven't yet seen Sal or Sonny. Guns are up, aimed, being pushed down ... Cops run for better vantage points.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON HOWARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Moretti reaches him. He pulls the cop away from him and starts to give him hell for the rough treatment being given the guard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE IN DOOR OF BANK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With Sylvia in doorway, staring wildly at the street scene. Sonny is beside her covering her with his rifle.
</DIRECTION>
<SYLVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My God! That's Howard! We voted to send him out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SYLVIA>
<DIRECTION>
VARIOUS ANGLES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the cops slowly realize their mistake. They stand back from Howard, who is virtually catatonic with fear and shock now. They get him up, a reluctant to believe they could have made such a mistake ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON TV CAMERAMAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Near barber shop, across the street, jockeying, trying to focus in on him, elbowing each other, they yell out:
</DIRECTION>
<CAMERAMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! Come out, get in the light. Hey, out where we can get a shot, huh? Who's the black guy?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(etc. AD LIBS)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOW ANGLE - HELICOPTER (TO AND FROM)
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
DOOR OF BANK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny back in the shadows with Sylvia, looking at Moretti, appalled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON MORETTI
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind him a mob scene. Howard is being led away, weeping. Photographers, cops, a phalanx of cops have their weapons levelled on Sonny like a firing squad. It is right on the edge of violence ... of blowing up. Sonny and Sylvia are in the shelter of the doorway, Moretti stands on the sidewalk, looking toward Sonny inside the bank.
</DIRECTION>
<MORETTI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sonny - come out here a minute.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORETTI>
<DIRECTION>
At this point, he removes his jacket and drops it to the ground, showing Sonny that he is unarmed.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got these cops outta here. They're comin' in too close.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<MORETTI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on. I want you to see something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORETTI>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want me to give up, huh? Look, Sal's in back with the girls. Anything happens to me - one move - and Sal gives it to them. Boom boom. How do I know you won't jump me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<MORETTI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't forget about Sal and the boom boom room. I want you to see this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORETTI>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny turns back to tell Sal he's going outside. Moretti stands well out in the street, to reassure Sonny nobody is going to try to jump him. Sonny stares around; he nudges Sylvia out ahead of him. As they edge into sight of the Media across the street:
</DIRECTION>
<NEWSMEN_AND_PHOTOGRAPHERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Out in the light. Hey, Lady! You're on TV, Lady! Smile, any ... god damn thing ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEWSMEN_AND_PHOTOGRAPHERS>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLES - SHOWING CROWDS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
straining against police lines: this is where we begin to sense the size of the event. People are eating popsicles and ice cream. They are diverted and excited. Sonny and Sylvia begin to emerge: CATCALLS and HOOTS of greeting ....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER - SONNY AND SYLVIA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as he looks around, and the impact of his situation really hits him: he's not only totally surrounded, he's an event. Some of the crowd CHEER him. An army of Cops, and guns all levelled on Sonny.
</DIRECTION>
<MORETTI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let Sal come out, take a look. What hope you got? Quit while you're ahead. All you got is attempted robbery.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORETTI>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... armed robbery ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<MORETTI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, armed, then. Nobody's been hurt. Release the hostages, nobody is gonna worry over kidnapping charges, the worst you're gonna get is five years -- you can be out in a year.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORETTI>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny stares at him, his face utterly blank.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kiss me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>

Moretti stops, stares back.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who the fuck are you tryin' to con me into some deal? You're a city cop, where's the FBI? This is a federal offense, I got kidnapping, armed robbery, they're gonna bury me! You know it, you can't talk for them, you're some flunky pig tryin' to bullshit me. Now God damn it, get somebody in charge here to talk to me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<MORETTI>

	</DIALOGUE>
</MORETTI>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Calm down... look at this, look at him...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
Gestures at the cops, the wall of rifles and machine guns levelled on him. It is incredible and terrifying...
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They wanna kill me so bad they can taste it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a defiant step into the street. The crowd SCREAMS as they get their first view, which is of Sonny telling the Cops off. They don't need to hear the words, they can see it.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
(screaming)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Attica! Attica! Go ahead! Blow off the front of the whole God damn bank!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
He holds his hands wide offering himself as a target to the hulking officer.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
(to the TV)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If it wasn't for you guys they'd kill everybody and say it was me and Sal.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Moretti)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You tell 'em to put the guns down. I can't stand it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
He means it. Moretti gestures to the officers to back away, lower the guns. The crowd YELLS: Sonny has beat the Cops. He is momentarily their hero.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a breaking point. Moretti makes a decision.
</DIRECTION>
<MORETTI>
<DIRECTION>
(Cop language command to put gun away)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right - put the guns down!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORETTI>
<DIRECTION>
He has to YELL it twice before the Cop slowly, angrily, stuffs the gun into his holster.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOUND: The crowd screams.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON SONNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
hearing the Crowd APPLAUSE. He turns and grins and waves to them. They SCREAM more. He turns and waves to the media. They've been YELLING.
</DIRECTION>
<MEDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, over here! Give us a wave!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEDIA>
<DIRECTION>
It is at this point that newsman leans out a window of the second floor of the bank, quickly lowering a mike boom. Sylvia sees this above her head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON MORETTI
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
unhappy, looking around at Sheldon, who shrugs. He did what he had to do.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON SONNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly realizing what control he has, enjoying it. He turns mockingly his left and his right profile to cameras.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TENEMENT HALLWAY

A FAT WOMAN runs heavily, stumbling, a delighted grin on her face, up the stairs PAST CAMERA, yelling to someone unseen upstairs.

INT. VI'S APARTMENT - DAY

Small, jammed with little things of sentimental value and cheap furniture, clean, but well-worn. VI, a small woman in her fifties, with a perpetual smile, and the sweating Fat Woman trot in, just as Vi's HUSBAND, a dour man in his fifties, is exiting.
</DIRECTION>
<FAT_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>

He hesitates in the doorway as the two women rush to the TV which is already on, the station showing live coverage of the bank robbery. On SCREEN, Sonny can be seen ordering the cops around. Moretti looks furious.

And she walks through the door past Sonny and into the bank. Moretti yells up at the media to get the hell away and at the same time, turns to a nearby cop and gives orders for the air conditioning to be turned off inside the bank.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the crowd realizes what has happened, they APPLAUD and SCREAM. At the door:

<DIRECTION>
PHONE CONTINUES TO RING.
</DIRECTION>

Sonny now walks over to the ringing phone on Edna's desk. Jenny, sitting on top of the desk, thinks the call is from her husband, starts to reach for it but as she does, Sonny grabs it away from her.

It's a heavy adhesive voice that can be heard clearly throughout the bank.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kill them all now? You fuckin' creep! Don't call here again!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>

Sonny slams down the receiver, looks around at the group.

<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see what we're dealing with? They want me to kill all of you!

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, we gotta get a jet outta here ... outta the country. We gotta get a helicopter. Okay, Sal? We get a helicopter on the roof to take us to the jet and we fly to the sunny Caribbean. Algeria. We got to look at the bright side. We got 'em by the balls, we got the hostages, we can get anything we want. They gotta give it to us.

Edna exits ladies room as Sonny crosses back to the phone, picks it up.

</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
Now Sonny turns and speaks to the group.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're all gonna get outta here. You're all gonna be all right. I'm gonna ask for a helicopter and a jet ... and we're gonna get outta here alive ... You've all been all right with me and as long as it stays that way, then things are gonna be all right - as long as you cooperate ...

Sonny slams the phone down and walks over to Sal, rifle still in his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You realize, Sal, that we're gonna get outta the country, so if you wanna talk to somebody, do it now ... You gotta Mother or a Father? Friends?

</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny starts to walk toward the door. As he does, Sal calls back to him.
</DIRECTION>
<SAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sonny! Gimme the gun. You don't need that.

Sonny realizes what he's saying and crosses back to Sal and hands him the gun, then moves toward the front door.

EXT. BANK - DAY

Much as before. Sonny steps out. The guns start to come up.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put them down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
The Cops lower their weapons. Moretti comes out on the sidewalk. He's eating an ice cream bar, and stands seemingly at ease, an island of calm control in a storm of passion about to be let loose. The Cops are always about to explode.
</DIRECTION>
<MORETTI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sonny, ya want somethin'?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORETTI>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny is about to open his mouth when a medium-size dark- haired Man who has been standing among people behind the barriers puts his head down and runs at astonishing speed right across the street towards Sonny. He catches everybody so by surprise he is already on Sonny before anyone can do more than start to yell at him to stop. Sonny, himself, can't believe it! He is slammed to the ground and the Man begins to punch him and beat him viciously. Cops charge in and with great difficulty pull him off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
YELLING on the radio network; TV Reporters and the crowd up and SCREAMING for blood!

</MULVANEY>
<DIRECTION>
He means Sal. Sonny, dazed and bleeding, reels to the door and calls in... Sal now stands alone behind 3rd pillar.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay, Sal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
He turns back to face Moretti, Sylvia, Mulvaney.

	</DIALOGUE>
</MORETTI>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE - SONNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looking around, bewildered, the crowd is YELLING and now it sounds unfriendly. He is really shaken up... He shakes himself -- stops that line and starts over in a business- like tone.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want a helicopter to get outa here! And a jet to take us to...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(cagey)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... wherever we want to go. Outa the country, so no little jets. A big one with a bar and a piano lounge.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<MORETTI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know, Sonny. I don't know if the helicopters can land in here. I'll have to check it out. I got superiors, unnerstan? They don't always see eye to eye with me. I'll do what I can.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORETTI>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny looks him in the eye. Suddenly he makes kissing motions and sounds with his lips. We know what he's referring to: he thinks Moretti's trying to fuck him over.
</DIRECTION>
<MORETTI>

(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

EXT. ROCKAWAY BEACH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's Heidi. Her body lies exactly as before, baking in the sun. The transistor RADIO plays... she seems to be asleep...
</DIRECTION>
<RADIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... the leader of the pair, a Vietnam veteran, Sonny Abramowicz, has demanded in return for releasing one of the hostages that police allow his wife to visit him at the bank. Police spokesman...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RADIO>
<DIRECTION>
Heidi sits bolt upright, stares at the radio, which continues to blather on. Abruptly she begins to gather up her things, her children, in a characteristically scatter-brained and hyperactive sort of way. Heidi is a one woman panic: she hustles away across the broiling sand carrying the radio wadded up in towels, and lugging a child, crying helplessly, by one elbow, as though it were a handle, a silhouette against the late afternoon sun, out of Fellini... meanwhile on the SOUND TRACK we are hearing her voice. It is a breathless, harsh childish voice that pours out the words in a torrent:
</DIRECTION>
<HEIDI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The transistor goes Sonny what? I couldn't believe my ears, so I shut the transistor, get outta here, who needs this? I say Sonny didn't do it. It's not him to rob a bank. It's not him to hurt anybody, to threaten anybody, to steal or do anything wrong. 'Cause he's never done nothin' wrong from the day I know him.
	</DIALOGUE>

She is stumping off into the sunset as she says these words and we

EXT. BROOKLYN STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Out of a subway crowd, she struggles, pulling the two kids by the hand, a very ordinary woman in a most ordinary New York scene...
</DIRECTION>
<HEIDI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Only he tells me this and he tells me that, he's with the Mafia, I say, Sonny, where do you get the money, you're on welfare, how can you rent a new Eldorado, red, you don't like the color you rent a yellow.

</HEIDI>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HEIDI'S APARTMENT HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A working class block, dirty, shops in the first floor, three story walk-ups above... Heidi appears and runs up the stoop. TWO COPS get out of a squad car where they've been staked out and move up to her. They never really get in a word edgewise. They follow her into the hall... Now as we CUT CLOSER to her, we will SEE Heidi's mouth in SYNC with the words...
</DIRECTION>
<HEIDI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So night before last we're at Coney Island, he's on the rides with the kids, an' I have this habit of goin' in glove compartments an' all, an' I see...

INT. HALL - DAY

Heidi struggles up the stairs, dragging the kids -- the cops following...

	- this gun with bullets in there, an' I go to myself, oh God, Sonny! That's all I had to see, I didn't say anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEIDI>
<DIRECTION>
She's got her door unlocked. Below and on the stairs behind the Cops, curious neighbors peer in...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HEIDI'S APARTMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chaos out of cut-rate furniture stores. Full of unwashed glasses, kids' clutter. Throughout, the children rush around unchecked. Neighbors enter without ceremony and listen. The Cops stand, trying vainly to communicate... As they enter...
</DIRECTION>
<HEIDI>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And things are adding in my head, how crazy he's been acting, and in with a bad crowd, an' I look at him, he's yellin' at the kids like a madman. So inna car I said to him, Sonny, what you gonna do with the gun? You gonna shoot me and dump my body inna river or what? I was so scared of him, I never been scared of Sonny never. You know, his mother says the cops was always at our house, we was always fighting. I hit him with the jack in the car once, but I only missed and hit myself, you should of seen my leg. And all he would ever do is put on his coat and go out. So they say it's Sonny but I don't believe it.

</HEIDI>
<COP_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lady, you saw him. You saw his gun.

INT. BANK - LATE AFTERNOON - APPROX. 5 PM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The group is now situated like this:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
1) MULVANEY'S DESK - the TV is on; seated in his chair, filing her nails is MIRIAM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seated to her left, having pulled the chair a patron uses, is MARIA, watching TV and listening to her transistor radio, against her left ear, at the same time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MULVANEY (at back water cooler - will eventually move back to his desk, sit down to Miriam's right.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
2) EDNA - is now behind the Tellers' cages, straightening up the mess; she picks up the loose money that Sonny had scattered thru the air, puts them into packets and ties them with rubber bands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
3) SAL - is seated in the rear Conference room, still holding his rifle, feet up on the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
4) MULVANEY & DEBORAH - at the rear water cooler (from which she will move to see what's wrong with Margaret)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
5) MARGARET - seated at her desk, obviously ill, wiping her forehead, head bowed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
6) SYLVIA and JENNY - at far right table, doing a crossword puzzle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
7) SONNY - pacing back and forth Mulvaney's desk, posing a legal puzzle for Maria.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny, his gun now lying across the top of Mulvaney's desk, is pacing back and forth between the desk areas. He's talking to Maria in particular, but anyone in earshot in general.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's say I put a gun to your head and I tell you to kill a cop ... and you did. Who'd go to the electric chair ... you or me?

</SONNY>
<MARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You would ... you told me to do it.

	Yeah - But you did it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
Deborah crosses to Margaret who is ill. Deborah goes to Sylvia - who returns with her her to Margaret.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It should begin getting dark in through here. It is very hot and sweaty in the bank. OPEN SCENE ON:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE MULVANEY ON PHONE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is sweating, worried. He is listening to a conversation we can HEAR...as it goes on SHOT WIDENS to reveal the others in various postures of waiting. Sal more disheveled, Sonny's restlessness is unabated; he paces about like a caged animal. The voice on the phone is breathy and youthful: Sonny has been listening for a long time.

Sonny is desperate to get off the phone but doesn't dare risk the wrath of God by hanging up on this guy. He might have the secret after all.

Sonny hangs up. Deborah moves to Margaret, who is ill. She goes to tell Sylvia who immediately crosses to Margaret.
</DIRECTION>

ANGLE ON MARGARET & SYLVIA
</DIRECTION>
<SYLVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The air conditioning is off or something. Looks at Margaret - she's sick.
	</DIALOGUE>

Sonny moves toward Sal in the Conference room. Mulvaney follows discreetly behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sal, I'm gonna take a look at the air conditioning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny and Mulvaney start to move out toward the back door area.

And Sonny and Mulvaney exit toward rear of bank.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BANK - BACK DOOR AREA - LATE AFTERNOON (APPROX. 5 PM)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny and Mulvaney move toward the back door and stop under a trap door in the ceiling. Mulvaney looks up at it.
</DIRECTION>
<MULVANEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's gonna be up there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULVANEY>
<DIRECTION>
As Sonny is staring up at the trap door, thinking about what to do, he hears a tiny scratching SOUND.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny, tensing like an animal, peers around wildly to locate the source of the little scratching SOUND: like mice at a steel door.

<DIRECTION>
ON GROUP - DESKS' AREA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny races back in, grabs the gun from atop Mulvaney's desk, and with the cartridge in the other hand, runs back toward the back door again, jamming cartridge into rifle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At this point, Sal runs in from the Conference room, covering everyone point-blank again, yelling for Edna to join the rest of the group.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>

	Sonny, if you shoot, shoot high ... my car's parked out there.

</MULVANEY>
<DIRECTION>
ON SONNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
staring at the door. He hears the continued scratching noise and might even see the door knob move.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Abruptly he swings the rifle up so the bullet going through will clearly go over the head of any man, out through the transom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He FIRES.

<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON INSIDE - SAL AND GROUP

They all scream, some of them falling to the floor, huddling together in terror.

EXT. BANK - REAR DOOR - LATE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A knot of half a dozen police are working at the door. Two were trying to work tubes under it to pump in gas, others were trying a nylon line to the doorknob, the idea being that if Sonny came out that way, the moment he began to open the door the cops would yank it open, exposing him completely and gun him down. The cops SCREAM as the SHOT comes through the door, showering them with brick fragments. They scramble over cars, over each other, over fences, running into other cops, who also, not knowing what's happening, turn and flee, running into the crowd, which panics.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VARIOUS ANGLES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
on men, women, children, cops, detectives, dogs, cats, reporters, all in the area of the rear of the bank fleeing in waves over fences, cars, etc. A flood of people like lemmings. This is INTERCUT BY:

He now walks behind Tellers' cages and picks up some of the decoy money that Edna had started to clean up and re-stack. Mulvaney walks over to him.

Sonny grabs bills from the wad he holds and thrusts them at him.

(looks at Moretti; Moretti nods)
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep the change...

</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
As the cops reach for the money, knowing it's bank money, people in the crowd yell:
</DIRECTION>
<CROWD_AD_LIBS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, over here! Hey, robber! How about a thousand! Throw some over here! Hey, no shit, I need an operation, I don't even have a job...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Etc.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny holds up the money. The crowd cheers. He throws the wad of bills and it scatters in the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The WIND is blowing now. Even some cops join the ensuing melee to gather it up...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VARIOUS ANGLES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as cops move forward and try to catch the bills. Some blow into the crowd. Fights break out in the crowd as they scramble for the money. The crowd breaks the barriers and swarms after the cash. Cops try to retrieve bills; fist fights, arrests.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MORETTI
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
staring at the mess.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny also watching the people.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is in both of them the same reaction of faint disgust at the greed unleashed. Sonny angrily hurls another bundle after the first... then laughs as he watches the people fighting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Moretti nods ironically at him. Sonny turns and enters the bank with the food. The fighting goes on in the street.

He puts it down in front of Mulvaney, on Mulvaney's desk. Mulvaney looks at it, sickly. As Mulvaney looks up at Sonny:

<DIRECTION>
EXT. SIDEWALK NEAR BANK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Moretti, Sheldon, other top cops march fast-time toward the barrier where uniformed cops stand around a limousine that has drawn up to the barrier. It is full of white-haired officials, one of them the COMMISSIONER. He has a voice broken by whiskey, cigars, good food and yelling at football games.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DOLLY AT A LOW DRAMATIC ANGLE WITH MORETTI AND ETC.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It looks like they may be going into action. Moretti's attitude is not that subtly different now he's talking to brass. Commissioner doesn't get out; he talks through window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Commissioner's hand, pudgy and freckled with age, covers Moretti's where it rests on the door: he massages Moretti's hand fondly.
</DIRECTION>
<COMMISSIONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gene -- you smilin'?

<MORETTI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I never smile any more.

<COMMISSIONER>

	Whattaya think: we gonna kill any civilians tonight, Gene?

	I never make bets or guesses, that way I'm never wrong and I never have to pay out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORETTI>
<COMMISSIONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gene, Jesus, what a bull he is!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COMMISSIONER>
<DIRECTION>
A lot of comfortable CHUCKLES inside the limo. The Commissioner's hand lingers on Moretti's -- they are fond of each other, these men, linked in a relationship of a lifetime of shared experience, of attitudes, of maleness -- an accumulation of years of jokes about being late for dinner, of women waiting and women panting with desire, men secure in the bastion of their roles. What is being passed on here is a purely emotional force of approval and acceptance from top to bottom of a social institution that is the last totally masculine society: police. The homosexual content of this should not be lost: it lies in the comfortable fit of their feelings, in the fact, simply, that they love each other, for what they share.
</DIRECTION>
<MORETTI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So whatsa deal?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORETTI>
<COMMISSIONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They jet's comin' out. But don't let 'em off the ground.

	What if we gotta kill a whole lot of people?

<COMMISSIONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't let 'em off the ground.

</COMMISSIONER>
<MORETTI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen.

</MORETTI>
<DIRECTION>
He leans down to get close to his commissioner, because he's not fooled by the camaraderie into a false sense of security.

</SAL>
<SYLVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, you remind me of my 19- year-old brother - only he's got his hair down to his knees - he looks like something that eats berries and roots out of the ground. God forbid I should say something to him like, 'Listen, if you ever smoke marijuana, just remember that it's illegal' and he storms outta the house. You rob a bank, but you keep your body pure, is that it?

EXT. FRONT OF APARTMENT HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fire escape with the old lady and her jigsaw puzzle, the flak vested snipers, etc. Below in the street a police car plows through the crowd with red lights flashing but no sirens -- or perhaps just a low growl to help move the human sea aside. People are leaning over trying to see inside.

Moretti and Sheldon and staff move out into the street. The cop car is moving through police lines, cops lifting barricades aside to let it pass.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are NOW SHOOTING ACROSS THE CAR, OVER MORETTI'S BACK TOWARD THE BANK and Sonny.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The DRIVER of the police car gets out, with a huge grin on his face and nods to Moretti. The back door opens and another cop gets out, also grinning. They look around toward Sonny, as his wife gets out of the police car, on this side. She is spectacularly good looking in a lithe cruel sort of way, like Lauren Bacall, but right now she is a mess.

	He's scared. It's crazy. I never met anyone like him. His wife, he's a wonderful father to his children. His mother - you should see her - his mother and father together are like a bad car wreck - he lets it all slide off his back, he sees them, he pays their rent. Unbelievable. I wanted to get married ... He didn't really want it ... he's married already! But he did it. I don't know why. I thought it would help me, but it didn't. I was just as confused and unhappy was before; I did terrible things.

	Ten days I spent in Atlantic City - Sonny was frantic - he knew I was drinking; he didn't know where I was ... who I was with. I couldn't explain why I did the things I did. So I went to this psychiatrist who explained to me I was a woman in a man's body. So Sonny right away wanted to get me money for a sex change operation: but where was he to get that? 2500 dollars! My God, he's in hock up to his ears already.

<MORETTI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He needed money? For the operation for you?

<LEON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It made him crazy - so much demand, he'd fly into this rages. And I got more depressed than ever; I saw I'd never get the operation. So I tried to take my life - I swallowed about a half pound of pills ... blues, reds, yellows, downers, uppers, screamers ... you name it. But I just threw them up and wound up in the hospital. Sonny comes there and looks at me and just says: 'Wow!' So when I hear he's in the bank, I almost go crazy because I know he's doin' it for me.

There's no answer. Sonny steps out into the street. He can't see anything anymore.

He removes Sheldon's .38 from a shoulder holster, producing it for the crowd with a flourish like a magician: some of the old playfulness returns for a moment. He carefully and with showbiz flourishes searches Sheldon's thighs and groin. The crowd HOWLS. Sheldon bears it with stoic calm.

Sonny crosses back downstage again to Mulvaney and Sylvia.

<SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
(referring to Sal)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, I don't know him very well - but he's not gay ... and he's not going back to prison ... One time when he was in prison, they gang-banged him; 13 years old and eight guys gave it to him ... So Sal isn't goin' back to prison, no way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<MULVANEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry.

<MULVANEY>

	We like you, too.

</MULVANEY>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know - I had a job once. I used to work in a bank. I had been training ... I used to have a boss ... Mr. Don Frio ... he wore a toupee ... I wonder if you'd hire me if I came in here and asked you for a job ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<MULVANEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would I hire you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULVANEY>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.

</SONNY>
<MULVANEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not?

<SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
(grinning)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny walks back toward Sal.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you -- they're sending a jet. It's all worked out...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
But doubt hangs in the air like a pall...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP - SAL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
looking at him. Implacable. This tension between them over the question of Sonny's loyalty must be kept constantly alive with CUTS and looks, over dialogue...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SYLVIA & MULVANEY
</DIRECTION>
<SYLVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Somebody give me another cigarette.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SYLVIA>
<DIRECTION>
Sal turns to look at her reproachfully.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON SYLVIA
</DIRECTION>
<SYLVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wish somebody would tell me I'm gonna live long enough for it to be a habit. My parent, she'll be okay. My husband, he'll be okay. I even know who the bum is gonna marry. Terrific. She'll take good care of him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SYLVIA>
<MULVANEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Girls, I wanta apologize. For my language back there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULVANEY>
<DIRECTION>
Embarrassed, he walks toward the rest of group in the rear, stands by Edna's desk.
</DIRECTION>
<MULVANEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ladies ... I want to apologize for my language back there.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he walks over to his desk, sits down)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny exits Conference Room and moves downstage.
</DIRECTION>
<SYLVIA>
<DIRECTION>
(amazed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What'd you say? I didn't hear you say anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SYLVIA>
<DIRECTION>
They think for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He said the 'F' word.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNY>
<DIRECTION>
They stare at her incredulously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Someone giggles.
</DIRECTION>
<EDNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDNA>
<JENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The 'F' word. He did. He said the 'F' word.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNY>
<DIRECTION>
Edna crosses to her desk - disgusted - and starts to tidy up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The giggle catches the edge of their panic and anxiety and sweeps them into uncontrollable giggles and laughter: Sonny roars. Sal and Edna alone remain unsmiling. After a few seconds they force themselves to stop, to behave like they should under the circumstances. They are gasping and crying. Then ...
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's so funny?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<EDNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'm a Christian, and my ears are not garbage cans.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDNA>
<DIRECTION>
It sets them off again. They howl and giggle and laugh. Until at last they run down again. At this point, Sal rushes out of Conference Room.
</DIRECTION>
<SAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAL>
<DIRECTION>
He has seen something in the middle of the street, and now...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as they all turn to look out through the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THEIR POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Backlighted by the floodlights in the middle of street escorted by Sheldon, stands a figure, dumpy and gray, tentatively waving, a figure that bends over baby carriages in the park, picks beans one by one out of supermarket bins, lip reads get-well cards in pharmacies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They hear Sheldon, outside, on bullhorn:
</DIRECTION>
<SHELDON>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sonny! Could you come out, please? Could you come out, please?

</SONNY>

But as a dutiful son he starts for the front of the bank.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BANK - NIGHT

<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you want here, Ma? You could of watched it on TV.

	I talked to the FBI, I told them about you, they said if you just come outta the bank it's gonna be okay.

	You did what? Who did you talk to? What for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<VI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'm only trying to get you outta this. I told them you were in Vietnam, you always had good jobs, you were with Goldwater at the '64 convention, but you had marital problems...

	We can't stay here.

</SONNY>
<VI>

	Oh my God! I don't understand. If you needed money, why couldn't you come to me? Everything I got is yours. I got two hundred and maybe twenty-five in the savings. It's yours. You know it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VI>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny abruptly realizes he is getting sidetracked by Mom - like always. Tries to get it back again.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mom - they're sending a bus to take us to the airport. You understand? If you're here - they're not gonna send it. They'll think I'm gonna come out with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<VI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's wrong with that? The FBI was very understanding when I explained it to him. Everybody knows it isn't you ... It's the pressures from your home life.

<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For God's sake don't start in on Heidi again ...

</VI>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mom. Mom. There are some things a mother shouldn't say in front of her son.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<VI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If she comes down here, so help me I'm gonna mash her brains in. Everything in your life was sunlight and roses until you met her. Since then, forget it.

	She doesn't have anything to do with it! You understand that? Mother? This is me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<VI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know you wouldn't need Leon if Heidi was treating you right. The thing I don't understand is why you come out and sleep with Heidi anyway? You got two kids on welfare now. What're you goin' to bed with her, you don't have enough with one wife and two kids on welfare, you want a wife and three kids on welfare?

</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
She stares at him. He talks slowly and carefully to her.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a fuckup and an outcast. There isn't one single person in my life I haven't hurt through my love. You understand that? I'm the most dangerous person in the world, because if I love you, watch out, you're gonna get fucked, fucked over and fucked out!

	Did Pop come down?

</SONNY>
<VI>

	No. This really pissed him off, Sonny. He says you're dead. He says he doesn't have a son.

<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's right. You shoulda done what he did. Go home.

<DIRECTION>
He walks away and moves toward the bank door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON VI
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her desperate smile, apologetic and false at the same time, glistens with a mother's tears. After a long beat:

	I remember how beautiful you were. As a baby you were so beautiful. We had such hopes.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maria and Miriam are still dancing; Margaret is at her desk; Sal, Jenny and Deborah are in the Conference Room; Sylvia is still behind Tellers' Cages.

She leaves Tellers' Cages area, crosses to Sonny, grabbing a pen from Edna's desk on the way. Sonny's urgent mood reaches them. Sylvia gets note pad from Mulvaney. Takes the dictation...
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Being of sound mind and body, and all that shit...

Sylvia nods: got it.

(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To my darling wife Leon whom I love as no other man has loved another man in all eternity, I leave $2,700 from my $10,000 life insurance policy, to be used for your sex change operation. If there is money left over it is to go to you on the first anniversary of my death, at my grave. I expect you to be a real woman then, and your life full of happiness and joy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To my sweet wife, Heidi, five thousand from the same policy. You are the only woman I have ever loved, and I re-pledge my love to you in this sad moment, and to little Kimmy and Jimmy. I hope you remember me, Jimmy. You are the little mad of the family now, and will have to look after them for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To my mother I ask forgiveness. You don't understand the things I did and said, but I'm me, and I'm different. I leave you, the rest of the policy and my stamp collection. I want a military funeral and am entitled to one free of charge.
	</DIALOGUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Life and love are not easy and we have to bend a lot. I hope you find the places and the people to make you all happy as I could not. God bless you and watch over you, as I shall, until we are joined in the hereafter, sweet Leon, my Heidi, dearest Kimmy and Jimmy, and my mother. Sonny... here I'll spell the last name...

He sits and writes it for Sylvia.

<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Type that up and I'll sign it.

Nobody says anything about this document. What is there to say? Sylvia walks to her desk at the front of the bank, near the window, and begins typing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BANK - VARIOUS ANGLES - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The restless crowd STIRS, sensing something happening. Turning to see something coming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
APARTMENT FIRE ESCAPE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Cops gear up their weapons: radios CRACKLE. Something, a vehicle, is moving through the crowd, Cops shoving people aside to let it through. The Old Lady pays no attention. She is down to one of the very last pieces of the puzzle and is searching for the spot for it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOW ANGLE IN CLEAR PLACE IN FRONT OF BANK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the vehicle clears the crowd and slowly draws up in front. It is a long airport limousine of the type with many doors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It stops. Everyone's attention is on it. A black DRIVER gets out, a gay Afro knit on his head, coke dealer's shades, for the cognoscenti, one very long little finger nail, a nifty Van Dyke style beard and one gold front tooth. He looks around, holding a sheet of paper. Sheldon, others, approach. They are looking into the vehicles, opening doors, checking tires, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DOOR OF BANK

Sonny appears. He strides to the limo.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Get away from it.

After a moment the Cops all move back. Sonny opens the front door and begins to check it out. The Driver starts to move away...

	Well, by God I'm gonna remember you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>

And he turns and walks away.

Driver stops, uncertainly. Cops grab him to hustle him away. Sheldon steps forward with a neat twenty-years-younger carbon copy of himself...

	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's your driver, this is agent Murphy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDON>

He stands up and eyes Murphy. He just doesn't like it.

<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want him.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on. I'll pay you. Whatta you want? Two hundred? A thousand?

The Driver looks around desperately to the FBI, to get him out of this.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't look at him. I'm running this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
Pause. Sheldon finally reluctantly nods. Sonny motions for him (the Driver) to step forward. Before he can get in the car, Sonny stops him. Signals to him to get ready. Gives him a thorough pat search. Thighs, the whole bit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ANGLES AS HE SEARCHES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is tense. The Driver seems uptight. Sonny finds nothing until he touches a breast pocket. The Driver is very uptight. Sonny reaches in, pulls out a -- tiny bottle, with a coke spoon chained to the lid. Before Sheldon can see it, but the audience has, Sonny shoves it back, grins, slaps the Driver on the buns. The Driver laughs delightedly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He was afraid he'd get busted for the dope: the drive will be a cakewalk.

He loves the joke! They act as though they hadn't heard.

Sonny slaps him playfully on the arm and smiling turns to Sheldon.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
He points at Murphy. Sheldon stands there speechless. Driver stares at Sonny, his smile fading.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
(delighted)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you think you're dealing with, an idiot!
	</DIALOGUE>

Sheldon nods to Driver and Murphy. Murphy resumes role as driver of the limo. Driver gets out.

<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So long, copper.

</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
SONNY AND MURPHY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as they position the stretchout in front of the bank. It can be seen from inside. The FBI men stand well back from it. Murphy stands by the door. He also can be seen.
</DIRECTION>
<SHELDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, Sonny? You follow my car.
	</DIALOGUE>

Murphy nods. Sonny is satisfied and turns to the bank, takes Murphy into vestibule, indicating for him to stay there. Sonny continues toward group at rear.

</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
They start the action of filing the form and accepting the money... Sonny stops them...
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just give me a receipt. Hey, Sal, you okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<SAL>
<DIRECTION>
(deep in his hair or tie or?)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, Sonny.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAL>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right.

</DIRECTION>
<SYLVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's your document, Sonny.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SYLVIA>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah - it looks real official.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
They are ready. A moment in the dark. Sonny holds out the will to Mulvaney.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold it for me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
Mulvaney takes it. Sonny shakes his hand. Suddenly, emotionally, he embraces Sylvia. Suddenly they are all saying silent goodbyes. Shaking hands all around, formally.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Only Sal is left untouched, standing apart, watching them, in the dark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BANK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone waits in silence. The lights. The limo. The Driver waiting in the driver's seat. After a beat the door begins to open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VARIOUS ANGLES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Cops' guns are brought to bear. On the apartment fire escape the Old Lady is asleep, her puzzle complete. The snipers raise their rifles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FRONT OF BARBER SHOP - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sheldon stands there. The police radio network CRACKLES: "They're coming out. Perpetrators and hostages together. Only authorized personnel may previously authorized, and etc." Sheldon's eyes go to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS POV - SNIPER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A middle-aged Man who looks like an overweight accountant, in flak vest and helmet that seems too small, aiming through a telescopic sight at:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DOOR OF BANK
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
(letting Murphy out first; yells outside)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get away from the car!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
Something that looks like a multi-legged animal emerges. It is Sonny and Sal in the center of a tight group of the girls and Mulvaney, so they are completely protected on all sides by hostages. Over their heads is thrown some drapes from the bank that further prevent the police from drawing a clear head on Sonny or Sal without hitting a girl. In fact they can't be seen at all. This weird apparition appears, hesitates. The crowd YELLS: "SHOOT!" CHOREOGRAPH THE ACTION so the group hesitates, takes a step forward, then it's clear Sonny can't see well enough to go direct to the car, and the girls are uncertain which direction to go in, not having been briefed. So they stumble about, make false starts, and finally arrive at the car, where one girl gets into the second row of seats behind the Driver. Then Sonny slides across next to Driver.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VARIOUS ANGLES TO COVER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The police have no chance to shoot. The group looks like a bewildered centipede finding its way. Mulvaney detaches himself from the group and slips into the front seat, on Sonny's right.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON EDNA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
standing alone, outside filled-up limo. Sheldon walks over to Mulvaney's window.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
(to Sheldon)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay - you got your one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<SHELDON>
<DIRECTION>
(to Murphy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You follow my car.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he moves off)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maria gets in the rear-most row of seats. Sal next to her in the middle and then another girl. One woman, Edna, a plain middle-aged woman who has not said a word until now is left over. She stands by the side of the limo as the doors close and this phase of the operation ends, without mishap.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
(elated)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck! We did it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<SYLVIA>
<DIRECTION>
(to Edna)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goodbye, honey. Wish us luck!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SYLVIA>
<DIRECTION>
Edna pecks out dry little kisses to the nearest girls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE THROUGH SONNY'S DOOR WINDOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Edna pecks... goodbye.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be a son of a bitch -- we're all okay! Hey, man! Honk the horn. Let's go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
Sal has his gun pointed on back of Driver's head.
</DIRECTION>
<MURPHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Sal - do me a favor ... point that gun up, huh? We hit a bump and the fuckin' gun'll go off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURPHY>
<DIRECTION>
The Driver honks the HORN: they're ready. The crowd SCREAMS. Cops keep jockeying for position, but there is no way to get a shot in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON SHELDON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No emotion. He steps into his car, a police car pulls up behind, and the procession starts to pull slowly toward the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON EDNA AND BANK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the limo pulls away, she is bewildered by the rush of police, bank people, FBI men who stream past her, ignoring her, all pouring into the bank. TV crews move by and finally -- one stops to interview her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE CARAVAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
being rammed through the jam of Cops and screaming people trying to get a last look. The hostages looking out, wan, worried. Sonny and Sal inside, alert, ready with guns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIMO - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<MURPHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sal - please keep that gun pointed up, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURPHY>
<DIRECTION>
THEIR POV - MOVING SHOTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
from inside the limo. The faces of the poor, the excited, the vicious the curious, and in ONE SHOT some of the people from the Gay Liberation Movement carrying hastily lettered signs: one protesting Sonny:
</DIRECTION>
<YOU_ARE_AN_INSULT TO_YOUR_KIND>
<DIRECTION>
and another:
</DIRECTION>
<WE_LOVE_LOVE_LOVE YOU_SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
Their scared and wan faces swim past in the mob. Sonny's mother is briefly seen looking out of the barber shop window, alone and forgotten. The Cops stare heavily, sullen with anger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now the limo is moving faster. People are running alongside, YELLING insults, trying to see in, asking for hand-outs, but they are going faster. Inside, they say nothing. Up ahead, Sheldon's car flashes a red light. Behind, the police car does the same.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VARIOUS EXT. AND INT. ANGLES - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the procession moves through Brooklyn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVING VIEW FROM GROUND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A helicopter follows above them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIEWS IN STREETS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They move along, followed by a HONKING parade of kibitzing cars, like a Mexican wedding.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE AT AIRPORT THRUWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They turn onto the thruway, trying to out-distance the cars tagging along.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIMO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. Sonny and Sal hold their rifles ready between their knees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE N AIRPORT FENCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as they veer off the thruway, a barely seen Guard swings open a gate and they ROAR through. The Guard pushes the gate to, and the following caravan of cars brakes, skids and a pile-up of fender bender accidents begin, cars going into the fence and each other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FULL SHOT - THRUWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cars are strewn all around. Doors open and Drivers leap out ready to YELL and do battle. The Cops guard the now closed gate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KENNEDY AIRPORT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Distant lights, some moving. Total darkness. The FBI car, the limo, the following police car move across the darkness...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIMO - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They sit quiet, following the FBI car. The FBI car stops. They stop. Silence.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Murphy, can you see what they're doing?

</SONNY>
<MURPHY>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</MURPHY>
<DIRECTION>
Sheldon is getting out of the car up ahead. Sonny and Sal and all of them come alert. As Sheldon and the other FBI men get out of their car, a pair of aircraft landing lights become visible, taxiing towards the limo.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There it is, Sal. Sal?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<SAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAL>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Jesus! Hey. How about food? I forgot to ask to have food on board.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
Sheldon has been walking down to the limo. He stops beside Mulvaney and KNOCKS on the window. Mulvaney rolls it down.
</DIRECTION>
<SHELDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the jet. You give us one more, now. That's the deal...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDON>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Which one goes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
There is silence inside the limo. Mulvaney turns to Sylvia.
</DIRECTION>
<MULVANEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sylvia?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULVANEY>
<DIRECTION>
From a handkerchief, Sylvia draws a slip of paper.
</DIRECTION>
<SYLVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's Maria. Go on, honey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SYLVIA>
<DIRECTION>
They open the door. They urge her out, and Maria goes with a show of reluctance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON MARIA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she stands up outside she is revealed to have a rosary she's counting. IMPROVISE goodbyes, tearful and fearful all around. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<MARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I pray for your safety...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(meaning Sonny and Sal)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Sal? Because I know it's your first plane trip. Don't be scared, you know?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(gives him her rosary)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And Maria walks away. Now the plane has taxied into position, where it can be seen in floodlights. It looks big and impressive. We know the FBI has snipers ringing it.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I ain't eaten all day. I just realized it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<SHELDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll have hamburgers on the plane. You ready?

	Sal, keep it up, huh? The gun - please ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURPHY>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE - SONNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
looking at the plane, grasping his money and his gun. The rifle stands straight up between his legs. Sheldon leans down, peering in at him.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you think, Sal? You ready to go?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - SAL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
in front of Sonny, behind Mulvaney. For the first time he smiles. He realizes that escape is within their grasp. The smile transforms him from a formidable Mafia imitation into an utterly sweet and defenseless youth.
</DIRECTION>
<SAL>
<DIRECTION>
(gun pointing high)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Sonny - You did it!

	<DIALOGUE>
	You ready to get out first?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDON>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
Driver starts to turn in the driver's seat!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sheldon brings up his hands to reach through the open window to grab Sonny's rifle barrel, pushes it away, aiming out windshield.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mulvaney sees them beginning their move and starts to duck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sal begins to see movement out of the corner of his eyes and is barely beginning to react.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DRIVER TURNING HAS A GUN OVER THE BACK OF THE SEAT!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny sees it, and Sheldon's hand grabbing the barrel of his gun at the same moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sheldon drives hard into the side of the limo, reaching in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mulvaney grabs the girl next to him and pulls her by the hair down toward the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sal, open-mouthed with amazement, is a split-second late bringing his gun up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Driver completes his turn and has his gun leveled at Sal between Miriam and Margaret in middle row.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sheldon grabs his rifle barrel and pulls hard. Sonny lets it go.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sal stares at the gun barrel, trying to get his gun up...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Driver FIRES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mulvaney hits the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sheldon holds Sonny's gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny, CLOSE, watches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sal, hit, slams back into the seat; the gun flies upward. Another SHOT hits him, flinging his head back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Driver holds his third shot, turns to Sonny - holds gun to his temple.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny looks down so he can see fully as:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sal's head snaps back for a split second and stares directly into Sonny's eyes, upside down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stares sadly, into Sonny's eyes. As though he knew it all along -- betrayed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And dies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SHOT is ECHOING. Now SCREAMS, YELLS, SLAMMING doors, panic... Sonny's voice: "Shoot me! For God's sake, shoot me!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FULL SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They come pouring out of the limo, scrambling frantically away from it. The limo -- the people fleeing it. Agents pull people away from the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Driver and Sheldon and Cops peer into the back. Sal's body lies slumped.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Driver, Sheldon, other Cops stand about, recovering. No one makes the slightest sort of congratulatory move, it was just another job. Driver clears his weapon, hands it to Sheldon to be filed in case of investigation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON SYLVIA, MULVANEY, HOSTAGES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They hug, cry, laugh, jump up and down: they're alive!
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

And she kisses him hard in the mouth. He laughs and kisses back...

Tears are beginning to flood past his defenses:

	You are under arrest. You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to counsel to be present, during your interrogation.

His voice is dry, as though he were reciting from memory something he learned in a language he doesn't understand.

Remnants of the crowd of sightseers, being interviewed by TV men avid for more, more, more news... these are people among the group that held up the big banner earlier: now we see them up CLOSE. They're folding up their banner. A very ordinary-looking YOUNG GUY.

THEIR REACTIONS

They stare at him; they've already begun to forget him: the moment in the bank when they said their goodbyes is already receding from their consciousness. Their smiles are forced, and they don't really know what to say.
