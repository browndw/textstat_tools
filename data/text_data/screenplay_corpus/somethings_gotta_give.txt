</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear, Ja Rule's "Livin' It Up"...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NEW YORK CITY - A HOT AUGUST NIGHT - MUSIC OVER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MIDTOWN. A Brunette Beauty crosses in front of a stack of cabs, her sheer dress clinging to her remarkable body. A Club in THE MEATPACKING DISTRICT. A long line waits to get in. A couple of Gorgeous Girls show up at the velvet rope and are promptly" let inside. SOHO. A Crowd spills out of a Bar and onto the sidewalk. A Confident Knock Out in jeans and a tank top laughs, drinking a beer out of the bottle.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Ahhhh... The sweet, uncomplicated satisfaction of The Younger Woman. That fleeting age when everything just falls right into place. It's magic time and it can render any man, anywhere -- absolutely helpless. Some say I'm an expert on The Younger Woman. Guess that's 'cause I've been dating them for over forty years...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
INTO AN EMPTY FRAME COMES HARRY LANGER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
What is it about him? Could be his eyes, the turn of his mouth...something about this guy is just so damn appealing. Maybe it's just the way he wears the Young Slinky Girl on his arm. He's confident, cool, enviable. We're in:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CHIC EATERY - DOWNTOWN

<DIRECTION>
The place is full. Everybody is somebody here.

	Langer. ..
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The Maitre'd snaps to attention at the sight of him.
</DIRECTION>
<MAITRE_D>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Langer, got your table waiting.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
As Harry and his Girl wend their way around tables, we pass Other Couples. Young Couples. Middle-aged couples. Not talking Couples.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what does a life of bucking the system all add up to?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To never settle down with the right woman for a life of leftovers and Christmas mornings. No his and her IRA accounts, no mini van parked in the garage. I think it's made me what I am today.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Harry smiles to someone across the room)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The luckiest son of a bitch on earth. Look at me. I'm positively debonair. I should be illegal I'm lookin' so good.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Harry passes a table where a BEATEN SIXTY YEAR OLD dines with his AGE APPROPRIATE, WELL-FED WIFE. IN SLOW MOTION, Harry and The Beaten Man catch each other's glance.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It isn't as if I haven't wondered what my life would be like if I was a Regular Joe and came in here once a month with a dame my age' for a porterhouse and a side of spinach. I've wondered...

</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHIC EATERY - HARRY'S IMAGINATION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry ENTERS all over again. This time he looks older, something in his walk and the boxy cut of his jacket. With him is a regular looking, nothing-to-write-home-about WOMAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN HER FIFTIES.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, come on, let's be honest. ..a dame really my age. . .
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHIC EATERY - HARRY'S IMAGINATION - TAKE TWO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Again, the identical set up. Harry ENTERS again. This time he looks ten years older. The bounce to his step is gone. The twinkle in his eye, long dead. On his arm is a 63 YEAR OLD BATTLE AX, built just like Harry. The Maitre'd reluctantly shows them to a shitty table.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There you have it. The story in a nutshell. Not exactly debonair, am I?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Harry TRIPS, his wife looks disgusted)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Awww, man, it's down right sad. Look at me. I look like I'm about to die. God help me. I do not want to die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
SMASH CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LONG STRETCH OF PRISTINE COUNTRY ROAD - THE HAMPTONS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Silver Mercedes convertible bursts into FRAME. Harry's behind the wheel, shades, smoking a cigar, livin' large. Next to him sits a thoroughbred of a girl. An "IT" Girl. Smart, sexy and built for fun. She has perfected flirting to an art. Her hand rests on Harry's neck. There's a good thirty year age difference between them. Her name is MARIN. She SINGS along with Ja Rule, now coming from a CD.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIN>
<DIRECTION>
( singing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To all my thugs that be livin' it up, we say, what I do. To all my...

	Oh! This is it. Make a right.

</MARIN>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(admiring the neighborhood)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So baby, you're rich... .
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<MARIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, my mother is, sort of. Not really...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If she lives within a mile of here, she's rich.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<MARIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess a hit play will buy you a house in The Hamptons.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like to meet your mother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<MARIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No you wouldn't. I mean, she's great. She's totally brilliant, but she's not your type.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're overlooking one of the great things about me. I don't have a type.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<MARIN>
<DIRECTION>
(very directly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's over thirty.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Harry looks to Marin, feigning hurt.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, what?! Like you don't know you have a slight reputation for...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIN>
<DIRECTION>
Just then the CAR PHONE RINGS. Harry keeps looking at Marin.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- For what?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Harry waits. RINGGG! He doesn't look away.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For never dating anyone over 30. Don't look at me like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's just not true.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<MARIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Sorry. Over 31?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, so you wait 'til we get out to The Hamptons to let me know you're a wise ass.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(answers phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold on. . .
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then to Marin)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It just so happens, my dear, that women of a certain age, don't date me. You ever think of it that way? No, it's always me. You dames are all alike.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then into phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<MARIN>
<DIRECTION>
(amused, to herself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dames...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Marin continues singing along with Ja Rule as Harry confidently slips his hand onto her thigh.
</DIRECTION>
<BARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(into phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vh-huh.. .I'll call back Monday. Who else? Monday... Monday... Say you couldn't find me. Who?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(glances at Marin, she's not listening)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll call her later. No, I have it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Harry hangs up, doesn't look in Marin's direction to see if' she caught that. This brand of cool is about not playing that card. Marin turns toward him, she has been listening. They've reached the end of the road, sand dunes, long lilting grass and the ocean stretch before them.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIN>
<DIRECTION>
(all business)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Make a right, left at the second fence.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Marin turns up the CD, getting herself out of whatever just came over her, looks out the window.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have I mentioned how gorgeous your breasts look in this sweater?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<MARIN>
<DIRECTION>
(blushing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes you have actually.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So it would be too much to mention it again. . .
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Marin laughs, softening, as Harry turns down a dirt driveway, driving toward a DREAM BEACH HOUSE.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow. It's the perfect beach house.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<MARIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. My mother doesn't know how to do things that aren't perfect.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which explains you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
That got her. Harry parks. She looks over at him but he's grabbing some cigars for his shirt pocket, then looks up at her with an innocent look that suggests he did not just say such a lovely thought.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIN>
<DIRECTION>
(trying to keep up with him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, okay, right...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They both grab their H
</DIRECTION>
<overnight_bags_and_step_out_of_the_car ARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, what are we gonna do out here, just the two of us, for two whole days?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Marin sets her bag down, walks to Harry, wraps her arms around his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me the truth, are you at all glad we waited?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm incredibly glad we're finally going to do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she's a bit disappointed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If that's the same as being glad we waited, then baby doll, I'm ecstatic.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Marin smiles then kisses him. He's one of those guys that lets you kiss them.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(slaps her tush)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go for a swim, how long will it take you to change?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<MARIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two minutes.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Marin starts UNBUTTONING HER SWEATER as she dances seductively toward the front door, then notices Harry's cigars.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh Har... No smoking in the house. My Mom doesn't allow it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But she allows you to strip in the front yard and bring men you're dating here to...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<MARIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She doesn't know everything I do...Or when I do it.. or where I do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She SLIPS OFF her sweater and DROPS IT ON HARRY'S HEAD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's one of those great Beach Houses. Light filled and warm with spectacular views of the sandy landscape wrapping around the rear of the house. Marin, now in a tight tank, tight pants, gives Harry the grand tour as she continues to undress.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIN>
<DIRECTION>
(TAKING OFF her belt)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The fabulous living room, perfect for entertaining an intimate group of friends or that special someone.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(DROPS her belt then UNBUTTONS Harry's shirt)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Behind me, the requisite Hampton's deck complete with pool and ocean view.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIN>
<MARIN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (UNBUCKLES Harry's belt)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your pants, please...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ladies first.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Marin provocatively UNZIPS her pants and wriggles out of them. She's now in a TINY TANK AND BIKINI PANTIES.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gourmet kitchen's to your left where tonight I will whip you up a culinary feast of Mac and Cheese.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Marin HEARS Harry's ZIPPER UNZIP. She turns, her EYES WIDENING as Harry's PANTS land on a chair. Harry is now down to his Boxers, an Open Shirt and a fearless smile.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIN>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	.. O-kay, going quickly now... Master bedroom is that away...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They arrive in a warmly decorated GUEST BEDROOM.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And this as they say on 'Cribs', your favorite show, is where the magic happens. Do we like it? Going once, going twice ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sold.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Harry takes Marin's hand and pulls her OUT OF FRAME and ONTO THE BED. She playfully rolls on top of him. His hands cup her ass.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know when I first started auctioneering someone told me if I was nervous to just picture everyone in the audience in their underwear. This sort of gives that a whole new meaning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why? You're not nervous now, are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<MARIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm always a little nervous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIN>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(removing his hands)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So put on your bathing suit. I brought some champagne, I'll put it on ice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<MARIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me like you, Harry Langer.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She bounces off him like a kid and disappears into the bathroom. Harry lies there alone for a second. Catches his breath. He sits up, feet on the floor, shoulders hunched, clears his throat, bangs on his chest. He waits a sec then stands with a stiffness that for the first time suggests he is not a that young man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now wearing only his Boxer Shorts, Harry crosses through the Living ROOM, singing 'Livin' It Up' to himself. He reaches into his bag and lifts out Two Bottles of Crystal. He sees himself in the mirror, sucks in his gut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Well stocked, the best of everything. Harry opens the door to the fridge and just as HE DISAPPEARS BEHIND IT, the BACK DOOR OPENS and TWO WOMEN ENTER from a beach walk, in the middle of a lively conversation. One of them is ERICA, Marin's Mother. The other is Erica's Younger Sister, ZOE. ERICA is in her mid-fifties and is a poster girl for growing old. It's actually hard to imagine 55 looking any better. And not because she looks 35, but because she makes 55 look graceful and right. Erica is the "girl most likely" who went beyond expectations but didn't realize until recently that being sure of herself was a handicap. She doesn't try to be intimidating, she just is. Her sister, ZOE is in her forties. Zoe's the loose one. She wears draw string pants and a T-shirt that says, "BOYS LIE". The Women stop mid-sentence when they notice the REFRIGERATOR IS WIDE OPEN. Then they SEE A PAIR OF BARE MEN'S LEGS poking out from UNDER THE DOOR. They don' t move.
</DIRECTION>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh God. What is this?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Erica nods to Zoe, gesturing a nearby knife. Zoe grabs the knife. Harry pokes his head out from behind the fridge, equally confused.
</DIRECTION>
<ERICA>
<DIRECTION>
(in control)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, stay right where you are. We have a knife.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(eyeing the knife)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you... live here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, Mister, look, I'm gonna dial 911 and you're not gonna move. Zoe, hand me the phone.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(reaches out to Zoe without looking at her)
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't understand. I'm a friend of your daughter's.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
With that, Harry SHUTS the fridge door. The Women see he's naked except for a Pair of Boxers. They both GASP. Zoe FUMBLES the phone over to Erica who dials quickly..
</DIRECTION>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah? I don't think so. My daughter's in the city and you what, wandered in here,like high on Ecstasy..?.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looks at phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit. I dialed 8-1-1.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(redials)
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(calmly starts to move)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honestly, if you just...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Back off. She was in the Israeli army. She can break you in half.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Zoe can't believe she just said that -- no truth in it whatsoever.
</DIRECTION>
<ERICA>
<DIRECTION>
(into phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. I have an intruder in my house. 29 Daniels Lane, Sagaponack.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm dating your daughter Marin. She invited me here for the weekend. She's in her room right now, changing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<ERICA>
<DIRECTION>
(GASPS even louder, really scared now)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're dating my daughter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(amused)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now who would've thought that would be worse news?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
With that, Marin ENTERS, in a tiny bikini, sees Harry in his shorts, Zoe holding the knife and Erica frozen, holding the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, fuck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIN>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, God.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(into phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. False alarm. Yeah, no, I'm sure. No, he's not a burglar
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(with enormous difficulty)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's dating my daughter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<MARIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mom, I had no idea you were coming out this weekend, you said you had to write.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIN>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do. I thought I'd do it out here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<MARIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, man, this is really....
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIN>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Awkward.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<MARIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Totally.. .but....
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(starts laughing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You gotta admit, sorta funny You thought he was a burglar? In his boxer shorts?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIN>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, well, the world's nuts, I don't know the man. . .
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<MARIN>
<DIRECTION>
(still laughing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, it's not really funny. I'm an idiot. I should've told you I was bringing someone out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIN>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no, I should've told you we were coming. Well. Anyway, here we are.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(waves to Harry)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello. I'm the mother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<DIRECTION>
All three Women turn to Harry who now dangles a long Lobster shaped oven mitt over his "privates"...
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harry Langer. How are ya?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<MARIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Sorry... Mom, this is my friend, Harry. Harry, my Mom, Erica... my Aunt, Zoe.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(they all shake hands)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harry's sort of a new friend. I think I mentioned him in an e-mail. We just, totally spur of the moment thought we'd get out of the city for a few days.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIN>
<ERICA_AND_ZOE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what? Actually, I think I should just take off. Let you gals enjoy your weekend...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Marin shoots her Mom a look. Help!
</DIRECTION>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no, no. Don't be silly. Uh, look, here's what we'll do. Zoe and I will leave. We took a great walk on the beach, we'll go into town for lunch. You two stay. Harry, apologize about the near arrest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you were impressive. Very strong, very... "macho".

</HARRY>
<ERICA>

	Yeah. Okay. Whatever...

Marin watches. Dying.

<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All righty then...I'm definitely gonna hit the road.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ladies...sensational meeting you.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Doll, call me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold on. Hold on. Let's not get so dramatic here. What are we four teenagers? We're all sophisticated people. Why can't we all stay, for the weekend? Your mother's got work to do I've got papers to grade. You'll do your thing, whatever that is and if we want to hang together, we'll hang together. If we don't, we don't. There's no reason why any of us should give up this spectacular weekend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<MARIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seriously. I can handle it.

The Women all look to Harry. He looks at Marin. She's hard to resist.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It can only go up from here.

</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:

HARRY AND MARIN

Walking past SHOPS on the MAIN DRAG IN EAST HAMPTON. They are both licking ice cream cones. CAMERA STAYS BEHIND THEM.

	Marin was how old when you guys broke up?

<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Five years ago, so. ..twenty-three.

</ERICA>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, so she was old enough not to feel Dave was walking out on her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that supposed to mean Dave walked out on me? Why do people assume when you break up after twenty years that the guy's the one who wanted out? Just because once we broke up he shtupped everything that moved...

	Easy cowgirl. I didn't mean it that way. Just trying to figure out why such a smart girl is always with the wrong guy.

A Gourmet Market in East Hampton. The clientele in here is as rich looking as the food. Erica stands on the other side of the Cheese Counter.

Marin crosses to the dessert counter. Erica turns back and catches Harry checking out Marin's ass. He smiles as he licks his ice cream. Erica rolls her eyes then spots another Older Guy with a Leggy Girl twenty-five years his junior.

<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's an epidemic.

Then Erica notices who's next to her at the cheese counter. She sees her Sister, Zoe, reading a cheese label with her glasses on and next to Zoe are two sad looking Old Women in their Eighties with their arms linked. Almost woozy, Erica is snapped out of it when she is handed her package.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_FRENCH_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Merci madame.

Erica heads down the aisle, passing Harry whose back is to her. Just as she passes, he turns and almost bumps into her.

They so very badly do not want to actually touch. Erica hesitates. Harry gestures for her to go first then walks alongside her.

	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, but, look, you know I hate rap, I mean I do. It's sort of violent and crude for my taste, not to mention just a tad misogynistic.

</ERICA>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, a lot of people see rapping as poetry.

Marin serves plates of pasta with lobster. Zoe pours wine and Erica tosses a salad. Harry is the only one sitting.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, Mom, how's the new play? You gettin' happy with it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Marin places a plate in front of Harry then runs her finger along "the nape of his neck. They smile at each other as she continues on. Erica notices, tries not to respond.
</DIRECTION>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, the thing with me is that I'm about 90% hard word, 10% talent and so far the talent part hasn't exactly kicked in yet.

	Yeah, right...

</ZOE>
<HARRY>

	What's your play about?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Marin and Zoe stop what they are doing and turn to Erica. She's hesitant to reveal this.
</DIRECTION>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	About? Well, I'm not exactly sure which is a bit of a problem, but so far it's about a divorced woman, a writer, she's this high strung, over-amped, controlling, know it all neurotic. . .

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, how did you two meet?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At a Wine Auction at Sotheby's. Harry was the big buyer of the night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I kept winking at Marin as she was conducting the auction and apparently every time I did that she misunderstood and I ended up buying cases of outrageously expensive wine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Zoe and Marin laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ever been married, Harry?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. No, I haven't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow. Now why do you think that is?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some people just don't fit the mold. And so far...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, if it ain't broke.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exactly.

Harry leans back, places his arm around Marin's chair. Erica takes note.

<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a second, aren't you like a famous bachelor?

</ZOE>
<HARRY>

</HARRY>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I think I read a piece on you in New York Magazine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<HARRY>

	I guess people find it interesting that I've escaped the noose for so long.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, wasn't the name of the article, "The Escape Artist"?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait. I read that article. That was you? You were once engaged to somebody big. Who was it? Not Joan Collins.. .Wait. ..Carly Simon?

	<DIALOGUE>
	So when was this engagement?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Long time ago. She was just this adorable lanky girl from Kentucky with the greatest pair of legs I'd ever seen... Never understood her ending up with a job where she never showed them.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(munches on his lobster)
</DIRECTION>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not serious? She's Diane Sawyer, she goes into caves in Afghanistan with a shmahtah on her head. Who cares about her legs?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just anyone who's ever had the pleasure of... You know what? I hate to eat and run but...

	Oh, so this is gonna hurt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, come on, listen, here's the rub for women. Look at what we have here with you and Erica. Harry, you've been around the block a few times, right? You're what? Around 60, never been married, which, we all know, if you were a woman, would be a curse, you'd be an old maid, a spinster, blah, blah, blah... Okay, so instead of pitying you, they write articles about you, celebrate your never marrying, it makes you illusive and ungettable. You're a real catch. Then, take my gorgeous sister here...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Any chance of you stopping here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, this is interesting. I mean, look at her, she's so accomplished, the most successful woman playwright since who? Lillian Hellman? She's over fifty, divorced and still sits in night after night because the available guys her age want
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Marin)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ZOE(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--forgive me honey for saying this, but they want girls that look like Marin so the whole over fifty dating scene is geared completely towards men leaving older women out and as a result that makes the older women more and more productive and more and more interesting, which, in turn, makes them even less desirable because as we all know -- men, especially older men, are threatened and deathly afraid of interesting and accomplished women. It's just so clear. Single older women, as a demographic, are as fucked a group as can ever exist.

	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOE>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then you know what? Write a dissertation on it, don't announce to the world that I stay in night after night after night and by the way, one night after night would have been enough. Did you ever realize, I stay "in" as part of my job. Why do you think I married the director of my plays? He was the only man I ever saw. Anyway, I like staying in and I like this time in my life. Why do I have to defend myself? I was married for 20 years. I'm done.

<MARIN>

	Can we not do this now? He's actually incredibly smart and fascinating and if you had talked to him about something other than his marital status you would've found out how smart he is. He owns like 10 different companies...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIN>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What does that mean he owns ten different companies? He can't commit, that's what that means. Not that, God forbid, I want him to commit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<MARIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, that I get. Anyway, he said he thought you two were very spontaneous and nice and then said he's leaving as soon as the sun comes up.

DR. JULIAN MERCER arrives at Harry's side. Julian is in his early-thirties and has finally just graduated out of the 'you look too young to be a doctor' syndrome. Julian is a man whose goodness makes him sexy. He wears his hair shaggier than you'd expect but then again, this is a Johns Hopkins graduate who chose to live near the beach and work nights.

As he watches the NITROGLYCERIN make it's way DOWN THE TUBE and APPROACH HIS ARM. Just as the amber liquid is about to enter his bloodstream he YANKS the IV out of his arm.

<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. You take care of it for me, sweetheart. I'd like to see that...

Erica puts away groceries, a little on edge. Her back is to a Man in his fifties, who sits at the island, eating a sandwich. He wears sweats and a baseball cap. His natural expression is -- worried. This is DAVE.

Surprised, Erica turns to find Harry leaning in the doorway in his pajamas, robe and slippers. No one's ever had more gorgeous clothes to sleep in. His presence disarms her.

	Hey, can I call you in a little bit. What's your number doll?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Harry, it's not like in any stretch of the imagination, I think you're all that right for my daughter but I don't really appreciate hearing you on the phone with other women. It's like I'm an accomplice to you cheating, it's...

	Your daughter knows I see other women.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Great? And that's what? Why are you proud of that?

EXT. BEACH PATIO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDE SHOT - ALMOST NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Erica and Harry sit not so close together at a long table, under a purple sky. Another French Tune plays. If this wasn't them, this would look romantic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing is said. Just two people eating. Harry lifts the salt shaker, about to add salt to his chicken.
</DIRECTION>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Should I just call the ambulance now?

Harry shoots her a look and places the salt shaker back on the table.

PHONE RING.

<DIRECTION>
INT. ERICA'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME - MUSIC CONTINUES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Erica works at a laptop at a cluttered table. The CLOCK tells us it's a little after ONE A.M. Annoyed by the ringing phone, she points her remote at the CD Player and stops' the song. Harry answers the phone in his room. A moment of quiet. Erica points her remote, starts the song again, starts typing again. Now the other line RINGS. She looks over at the phone watching one RED LIGHT "BLINK, while the other line is answered.
</DIRECTION>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What am I doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She throws a piece of paper over the phone so she can't see it. She clicks on her AOL ICON and is told: AOL CANNOT CONNECT. LINE BUSY. She's pissed. Then, worse, she SMELLS something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry is on the phone, smoking a cigar. His pajama top is unbuttoned, his hair is allover the place. His bed is a mess, laptop open, newspapers spilling onto the floor. Erica stands in the doorway. He quickly hides his cigar.

	Hey.

</HARRY>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, here's the thing. I really don't want to play the part of the uptight Nurse to your bad boy patient. If you want to have another heart attack, go ahead, it's your life but I have work to do and I don't have time to make another run to the hospital because you're filling your already clogged arteries with smoke but more importantly, I'd rather not have my house smell like a pool hall.

Erica holds out a partially filled water glass for Harry to deposit his cigar in.

<HARRY>

INT. ERICA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Almost TWO. Erica is writing, her eyes go to the phone with the typing paper over it. She LIFTS a corner of the paper, takes a peek. The one lit line GOES OUT. Finally. "Erica turns off her computer, sits for a second. No one has rattled her cage like this in quite some time. And no, she doesn't like it. She stands, starts to undress.

A very wide MIDDLE AGED NURSE gruffly crosses thru the room toward the Front Door. Just as she opens the door, Erica ENTERS in hat, sunglasses, turtleneck, long skirt. Pretty much no skin is showing whatsoever. She carries a few packages.

Harry hands her a wad of bills like she's a Maitre'd. Mrs. Gimble gives Erica a look of pity as she exits. Erica, now alone with Harry, self-consciously adjusts her sunglasses. Harry, on the other hand, slips his hand onto his bare chest, pats it.

	<DIALOGUE>
	When can I be up and running in that department?

<JULIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think Mr. Midnight needs to stay put for another couple of weeks.

</JULIAN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But it won't kill me when I do it, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<JULIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's exercise. It'll be good for you. And just so you know, I'm told after a heart attack, if you can climb a flight of stairs, you can have sex.

CUT TO:

<DIRECTION>
A LOW ANGLE OF A STAIRCASE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Which goes from the beach up to Erica's deck. Harry stands at the bottom of the stairs in his robe, velvet slippers and sunglasses.' He looks up to the top of the stairs as if it's Mt. Everest. Bravely, he climbs the first few steps. Not bad. After two more, he's out of breath. Determined, he holds onto the railing and drags himself up to the next step. Happy with himself, he holds on for dear life and drags himself up one more...and then, he's so out of breath, he can barely move, yet he reaches up the railing and tries to hike himself up one more.

The tea kettle WHISTLES as Erica and Julian stand on either side of her island. Erica reaches for a tea bag.

We begin to hear strains of another French song.

INT. ERICA'S BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON - MUSIC OVER

Erica at her desk, typing. The Music plays from the CD player. As much as she doesn't want it to be true, this attention from Julian has fueled her.
</DIRECTION>

THE LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME - MUSIC OVER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry, dressed for the first time, wearing khaki's and a summer shirt, strolls through the Living Room a bit cautious.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>

(yells, warning-like)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm Walking Around The house!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
ERICA Laughs. Even she knows this is funny. Harry arrives at her open doorway, timidly pokes his head in.
</DIRECTION>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, I've decided to get over the whole "you saw me naked" thing. So, we don't have to deal with it anymore. Okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good, 'cause I've been hiding from you all day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. You want to come in?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want to break your rhythm or anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That would be wishful thinking.

<DIRECTION>
Harry ENTERS cautiously and curiously.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Beautiful painting. So I'm gonna venture out there and go for a short walk...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You up to that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My doctor recommended it. I gotta build up to stairs and stuff like that. You wouldn't want to join me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That means you don't want me to?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I was asking if you wanted to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, well, I would but...I don't usually like to break once I've started writing so I probably shouldn't, not that a little fresh air would hurt but...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's just a walk Erica, not a marriage proposal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know my name.

</ERICA>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>

EXT. BEACH - MOMENTS LATER - LATE .IN THE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Erica and Harry walk by the water's edge. They are the only two people on the beach.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Did you know there are over eight thousand websites that mention you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That can't be possible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it's true. I know everything about you now. And not because of last night, but...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I understood. I actually looked you up too. You grew up in L.A., which I thought nobody did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<ERICA>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were the road manager for a group I sorta never heard of, started your own record label at 29, sold it at 45, then started buying and selling boutique companies then invested in a small record company which you turned into the 2nd largest Hip Hop label in the world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's exhausting just hearing about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know, but the truth is, it goes fast doesn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like the blink of an eye.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Erica bends down and picks up A FLAT WHITE STONE, then another and another...
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I noticed you have bowls of those all over your house.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know, I'm crazy, I just think they're so beautiful...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But why do you only pick up the white ones?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't only pick up the white ones.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, so you really are crazy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I pick up only the white ones?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looks in her hand)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, God, what does that mean? I'm controlling, unadventurous, what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you're as hard on yourself as you are on everyone else.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Erica is stunned that he caught on to that. Harry bends down, picks up a BROWN stone, places it in her palm among the white stones.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something to remember me by.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Erica realizes she can't sum this guy up so easily or at all.
</DIRECTION>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So can I ask you something Harry? What's with all the young girls? I mean, what's the story there, really?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just like to travel light.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You just like to travel light? Oh, please, what the hell does that mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now see a thirty year old gets that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean falls for that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, accepts it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If that's what you want... a non threatening woman, who won't get your number, you get to run the show...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think our relationship is growing by the way. Have you noticed?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
There he goes again. She can't believe he's cute like this.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm serious. Maybe we just needed to get out of the house. Now, you may notice, interestingly, we're walking back toward the house and its getting a little rocky again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course it's getting a little rocky, we're talking about you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See, I'll accept that slight hostility because I'm enjoying your company so much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
They're reached the bottom of the beach stairs. Harry looks up, daunted.
</DIRECTION>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but I think I'11 stay down here and watch the sunset. You interested?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Erica checks her watch.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Big dinner date?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, yeah, as a matter of fact. With your doctor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ohhhhh, my doctor, 'cause he's not too young for you, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, he's totally too young for me. But we're just having dinner. It's not a date.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does he know that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'll tell him, but I doubt that he thinks of it that way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I doubt that you doubt that. Anyway, you may like it. Think of it this way -- he's not threatening, won't get your number, you get to run the show. You might have a hell of a time.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Over, we HEAR, DING DONG.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THAT NIGHT - THE FRONT DOOR - SWINGS OPEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And we find Julian. Looking just as any girl would hope. Dream Date.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AND ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is Harry, in his robe and PJ's.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, look who's answering the door.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIAN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And look who's at the door.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<JULIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Brought you something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Julian hands him a take-out food box.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A heart healthy dinner from our cafeteria.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIAN>
<ERICA>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Both guys turn at once. She looks beautiful, wearing a dress, probably the sexiest one she owns. No turtleneck tonight. Julian walks to her, kisses her on the cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You look beautiful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIAN>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Behind Julian's back Harry gives Erica the 'OK' sign.
</DIRECTION>
<ERICA>
<DIRECTION>
(thrown)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We ready..?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<JULIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me just see how Harry's doing. It'll take two seconds. Har, have a seat. .
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIAN>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - HARRY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
sitting, self-conscious in his new role - The Sick One. Julian takes his wrist, feels his pulse. Harry looks straight ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHAT HE SEES - ERICA'S LEGS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as she sits right in front of him. She crosses her legs and her dress hikes up a little, exposing her thigh. JULIAN furrows his brow.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? That's not the face you want to see your doctor making.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<JULIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your pulse is a little fast but maybe you're just excited about something.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Harry LOOKS AT ERICA'S LEGS again.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(quickly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think so. I'm not excited about anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Erica shifts, the hem of her skirt RISING even higher.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There it goes again. Racing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIAN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doc... Impossible!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Erica rises, leaving Harry's eye-line.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, there we go, now I feel better. Back to normal.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Harry winces then rises, looks to Erica as she throws a pashmina over her shoulders in SLOW MOTION. Harry rushes them
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUT THE DOOR.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, all right, good, have fun, don't rush back for me and don't do anything I wouldn't do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well that wouldn't leave us too many options would it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And do we wonder how she writes that snappy repartee.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(whispers to Erica)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let him pick up the check. It'll make him feel older.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
On Erica's shocked expression, the DOOR SLAMS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT - A BEN WEBSTER CD PLAYS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry lies on the sofa. CAMERA MOVES UP Harry's body, past the hospital take out carton on his stomach and finally up to
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
his face. As the CAMERA moves we HEAR:
</DIRECTION>
<MARIN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, it's Marin, I'm not in so leave a message and I'll call you back.

</MARIN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, it's me...just sitting around looking at your baby pictures... Thinking about you...

He hangs up, dials another number.

	Hi and HI, you've reached Brooke and Shannon. For Brooke push one, for -

Harry hangs up then slowly sits up, letting himself feel as funky as he wants.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everybody's out but old Har.. .Old, old old old Har...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Harry rises dizzily, crosses to the bookshelves. He rummages around, finds ERICA'S SCRAPBOOK, pulls it out, randomly opens it, finds a photo of Erica in the 70's, wearing a turtleneck. Harry smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ERICA'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry wanders in with the scrapbook tucked under his arm. He notices a bowl filled with white beach stones. Harry's brown stone sits at the top of the pile.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(complimented)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Top of the heap...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON JULIAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Staring at Erica. He can't get enough of her. They're in a ROMANTIC SEASIDE RESTAURANT. And Erica's blushing for the first time in twenty-five years.
</DIRECTION>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- So, when the land came up, I snatched it and the house was built in record time and...

<DIRECTION>
(blushing to death)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's like a thousand degrees in here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<JULIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, they say doctors fall for people who need rescuing, that we have a need to take care of someone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIAN>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? I never heard that one.

	-- Thirty-three.

<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thirty-three.-Okay, so, I'm twenty years older than you. More than twenty years older than you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<JULIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You look fabulous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIAN>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you but you know, I'm not sure where you were headed with that thing you were just saying, but in terms of us, you just want to be friends, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<JULIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honestly? No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIAN>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, then, what is it that you... want to be?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<JULIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I'd embarrass you if I told you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIAN>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was embarrassed just getting dressed to see you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<JULIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This may surprise you but some women consider me quite the guy. I've never been married. I'm a doctor. You wouldn't believe what catnip that is for some women.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIAN>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yes I would. But, you don't like girls your own age?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<JULIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do very much. But I've never met one I've taken to quite like this and when something happens to you that's never happened to you before, don't you have to at least find out what it is?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIAN>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I suppose but, see, I don't date all that much or all that well...

	Oh, come on, you must beat them away with a stick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIAN>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Now you're kidding, right? No, guys my age, the ones I've met...well, I'm not that regular a person and they really like regular.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's something radically wrong with the idea that no one loves you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Ow. Right to the middle of her shoulder, then her neck. Julian kisses her palm, then her.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I knew you'd smell good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIAN>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's just...soap...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<JULIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How much is soap that smells like this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIAN>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. I got it at the market.

</ERICA>
<JULIAN>

	Erica, you're incredibly sexy.

MEANWHILE, HARRY IS SOUND ASLEEP ON ERICA'S BED
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her scrapbook open against his chest. We HEAR the SOUND OF ACAR pulling up to the house. Harry wakes up. Oh shit. He leaps out of bed, this is the fastest he's moved in days. A bit disoriented, he straightens the covers, looks around for other evidence then hightails it out of there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM - A MOMENT LATER
</DIRECTION>

Erica enters, letting out a huge sigh. She's brought back to reality when she hears the TV in Harry's room. She heads his way, then changes her mind and stops.

Erica, in pj's and glasses, sits at her laptop, writing. She hears the CHIME of someone INSTANT MESSENGERING HER. It a message from HARRYL37. It says: What R U doing?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We go BACK AND FORTH between their TWO ROOMS. She answers: Writing. Hi. What R U doing? He writes: Watching Joan Rivers sell jewelry. Erica laughs when he adds: So was your date a date? She types: I think so... He types: I told ya. (then) You hungry? Surprised, she types: I just had dinner. He writes: Yeah, but women never eat on dates.

She hesitates then types: Actually am a little hungry but, I'm in my pjs. He writes: Me too. Pajama party? SHE stares at the screen biting her lip. HE does the same.

Erica rises, LOOKS IN THE MIRROR, checks out her boobs in her pajamas. They look so low. She opens a drawer, rifles through it, takes out a bra, takes out a better bra. IN HIS BATHROOM, Harry fixes his hair, tries to make more of it than he has. Erica now wearing a bra under he pajamas, checks out her boobs again. Better. She adjusts the straps. Lifts them higher.

INT. LIVING ROOM

<DIRECTION>
Erica and Harry ENTER FROM OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE ROOM, both in their pajamas.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We are cute...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is pretty unusual for me. I'm not used to having sleepovers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me either.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? With your social life?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My, dear, you are confusing sex with sleeping. Sleeping is something I prefer to do alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, good to know.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(heading for the kitchen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, what are you hungry for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(joining her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are my choices? I mean I know you think I'm not very discriminating but...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She looks through the fridge.
</DIRECTION>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, God, what's the difference what I think. I can't imagine what you think of me. Okay, so... Pasta, left over coq au vin, turkey sandwich or grilled cheese.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pancakes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Totally what I wanted. Blueberries?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You ever miss being married? I bet you were great at it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sometimes I miss it. At night.. But not that much anymore. Was one of us just saying something interesting?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You said you can't imagine what I think of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, right, but you don't have to answer that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, if you had an opinion, I'd be curious but...'
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	will you tell me first why you only miss being married at night?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<ERICA>
<DIRECTION>
(cracking eggs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, 'cause the phone doesn't ring as much at night and the "alone" thing happens at night and sleeping by myself took some getting used to. But I got the hang of it. You gotta sleep in the middle of the bed. It's absolutely not healthy to have a side when no one has the other side.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She starts mixing the batter.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, now I'm convinced what I think of you is right.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Erica waits. . . )
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are a tower of strength.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<ERICA>
<DIRECTION>
(shoulders sagging)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ughhhhhhhhhh... .
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Try not to rate my answer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. It's just...I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're like a thoroughbred in a world of mutts. No, you know what you are, you're like a great portrait over a fireplace. Words have been invented to describe women like you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<ERICA>
<DIRECTION>
( fearful)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Such as?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Flinty and...Impervious.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you think I'm inhuman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I think you're formidable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But cold and distant. Like I'm frozen in some painting...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not at all. I think you're strength defines you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(sees how sensitive she is)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But it's thrilling when your defenses are down arid you're not isolated. That, I believe, is your winning combo. A killer combo actually.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... So I can't decide if you hate me or if maybe you're the only person who ever got me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't hate you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The moment is broken when they HEAR the FRONT DOOR OPEN and
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIGH HEELS APPROACHING.
</DIRECTION>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Marin ARRIVES IN THE DOORWAY in a knockout of a dress holding a bag from Zabars. She looks fresh, vibrant, sexy.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Room service!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIN>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing here at this hour?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<DIRECTION>
Erica and Harry have the air of kids caught making out by one of their parents. Harry straightens out his pajamas, smooths down his hair. Erica catches all this.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIN>
<DIRECTION>
(enters, kisses Erica)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had this big photography auction tonight, then I went out with a bunch of people, I checked my messages and got this so sad message from Harry so bored out here. I thought I should come out and at least see how he was doing.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(kisses Harry on the cheek)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you for the gorgeous flowers by the way. They were so huge...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Erica nods to herself. Oh, God, he sends them all flowers. Harry notes Erica's reaction.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So how are you guys?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(sets down the Zabar's bag)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, this is too sweet. You're making pancakes? Awwww. And you're both in your pj's. Now I feel I'm interrupting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIN>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be silly. You know I never sleep and this one doesn't sleep either. It's... .What's in the bag?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<MARIN>
<DIRECTION>
(reaches into the bag)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A quart of matzoh ball soup for Harry. I know it's not the remedy for heart problems but it is low cholesterol.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIN>
<ERICA>
<DIRECTION>
(hating to correct her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But high sodium.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<MARIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, sorry. Stupid. For Mom, your favorite raisin-bread. And for me...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(reaches into the bag)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My favorite Vodka.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Marin's cell phone RINGS.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIN>
<DIRECTION>
(into phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello? No I'm here, babe. Made record time. Everyone's still there?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Erica feeling suddenly frumpy, fixes her hair. Harry watches her. She catches him and shrugs. Marin flips her phone shut and tosses it in her purse.
</DIRECTION>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, Mar, now that you're here, why don't you finish the pancakes and I'll get back to work...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<MARIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mom! I just got here, hold on.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She pours a healthy Vodka into a glass, grabs some ice.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So your ex-husband stood me up today. We were supposed to have lunch at Barneys . He never showed up. Was he always like this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIN>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honey, I don't know...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<MARIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is what happens after a couple gets divorced, the kid inherits all the problems. Not that I'm a kid.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then to Harry, the flirt in her coming back)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So how are you, how do you feel? When can you go home?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Just as harry is about to answer, Marin's cell RINGS. She picks it up, looks at her caller ID, throws it back in her bag.
</DIRECTION>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I really am gonna do a little work. . . you two catch up. . . and just flip these Hin like two seconds.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<ARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't want pancakes anymore?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARRY>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I, uh, I don't think I...I...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looks at Marin so)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	gorgeous, next to him No. I don't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<DIRECTION>
Marin watches her mother EXIT then looks to Harry, his eyes following her Mom out the door. She's sees a look on Harry's face she never remotely saw when he looked at her. At first she's shocked. He likes my mother??? Then a flash of jealousy. He likes my mother!?! Then pure joy - realizing how perfect it is.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BRIDGEHAMPTON GENERAL STORE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Erica, back in a turtleneck, picks peaches out of a basket. Marin ENTERS HER FRAME, baseball cap, sunglasses, picking cherries.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm breaking up with Harry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIN>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why? What do you mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<MARIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Cause I met someone else.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIN>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In the two days you've been gone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<MARIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know me, my life's crazy. I meet a thousand people everyday. Also, let's face it, the guy's insanely old for me. I'd be nuts to keep this going.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIN>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	True, but you know he is....
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<MARIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- I know. He's soulful when you don't expect it, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIN>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's unnerving.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<MARIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, Mom, if you could handle this, I was thinking... you and Harry...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIN>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't handle it. Wouldn't want to handle it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<MARIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you're only saying that 'cause you think he and I have had sex.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIN>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Lower your voice. Haven't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<MARIN>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never even got close. Swear to God.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Erica digests this)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just puttin' that out there...'cause for two people who are convinced they got life beat, there's was somethin' cooking in the kitchen last night other than pancakes.

Erica looks out her KITCHEN WINDOW and SEES Marin and Harry TALKING ON THE BEACH. She leans so far to see them, she's about to lose her balance. The Phone RINGS, she reaches for it and slips right Out Of Frame.

ER, on his CELL PHONE.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've waited a reasonable amount of hours before calling you, even though you've been on my mind since I woke up at 5:15. I'm wondering when we could have dinner again? I have to work the next few nights and if we wait 'til next week, I know you'll chicken out so how's Friday? I know it's like a date night but I think that's good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIAN>
<ERICA>

Marin ENTERS through the kitchen door, looking almost a little dazed.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, he's all yours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIN>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop that. How'd he take it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<MARIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He just took care of it for me; He was an ace. Elegant. Said our fate was to be friends. ...Oh my God.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(realizes something)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was breaking up with me. He's a genius.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIN>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's impossible, he wouldn't...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<MARIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It doesn't matter, we're done and we both feel good about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(hugs her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I gotta get back.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as she exits)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now Erica, try to think of this as the smartest thing you've ever done for yourself.

Harry and Erica talk while looking at each other through the Kitchen Window.
</DIRECTION>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I heard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Made up a story about meeting another guy. Guess I wasn't so cute with an IV in my arm.

</HARRY>
<ERICA>

	No, I think she really did meet someone else.
	</DIALOGUE>

	You're a great woman, Erica.

THE BEACH - MUSIC OVER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Erica and Harry sit on a blanket on a cloudy day having a picnic lunch. Harry is telling Erica a story and she screams with laughter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BROWN STONES IN THE SAND - MUSIC CONTINUES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Erica picks them up as.she walks with Harry by the water's edge. They talk non-stop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LITTLE LATER - LIGHTNING STREAKS THE SKY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Out of nowhere, a downpour. Erica and Harry gather their picnic things. The blanket starts to fly and Harry grabs it as Erica runs after a plate spinning away in the wind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Erica and Harry, wet from the rain, quickly shut all the doors and windows. Lightning crackles across the sky and THE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LIGHTS IN THE HOUSE GO OUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MATCH IS STRUCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
and a CANDLE is lit. Then ANOTHER ONE, and ANOTHER ONE. Erica turns and finds Harry just looking at her. Before either of them has time to think, they kiss.
</DIRECTION>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(truly confused)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just kissed you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, honey, I kissed you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Relieyed, Erica kisses him.
</DIRECTION>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know that one was me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Try not to keep score.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He kisses her again and again.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Soft lips...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm so glad they still work.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
I haven't used them for kissing in so long. They've been more like for wearing lipstick and whistling and... He kisses her quiet. Relieved, she finally fully kisses him back. A big gorgeo~s kiss.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, well, now look who's got
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
something that works... They both look down at Harry. Hello, Mr. Midnight.
</DIRECTION>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you didn't even take Via-
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(puts his finger on her lips)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kiss me before you make it go away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
She kisses him long and sweet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ERICA'S BED
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They're kissing on it. The rain pelts against the windows as the sun goes down.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This could be world class interesting.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Erica nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Having any doubts?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<ERICA>
<DIRECTION>
(as they kiss)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But so far the kissing is spectacular.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(He looks at her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not grading you, just mentioning it. Brilliant.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He tries to kiss her neck but the turtleneck is in the way. He pulls it down, but it's tight and it's, difficult to get to her.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't get past your damn turtleneck. . .
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He tries lifting the shirt from the bottom, it's awkward, he doesn't want to be down there yet. He comes back up when Erica reaches to her night table, slides opens the drawer, takes out a SCISSORS and hands it to him.
</DIRECTION>
<ERICA>
<DIRECTION>
(breathless)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cut it off... Please.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
What a brilliant invitation. He takes the scissors and starts cutting from the bottom, right past her belly, up her torso, between her breasts. The turtleneck falls open from the center. When he reaches her neck, he gently tears at it and it easily rips apart and there she is. He takes her in.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're beautiful.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She shakes her head, 'no' ...shuts her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Open your eyes so I know you can hear me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she opens her eyes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Beautiful...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They kiss and she reaches down for his pants.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about birth control?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Menopause.

</ERICA>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(thrilled)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's the lucky boy...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He kisses between her breasts, her stomach, heads down and OUT OF FRAME. Erica can't quite believe life held this twist for her. Then:,
</DIRECTION>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think we should take your blood pressure.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
His head POPS BACK INTO FRAME. What?????
</DIRECTION>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's irresponsible not to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<DIRECTION>
HARRY -' A MINUTE LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
sprawled out on the bed. Erica straddles him and whips the blood pressure cuff on his arm and pumps it hard. Like a warm Jewish Mother of a Dominatrix. He looks up at her, shaking his head...
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nobody but you would. . .
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah...so you're lucky.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Erica grabs Harry's glasses, reads the results.
</DIRECTION>
<ERICA>

EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rain is coming down in torrents.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are CLOSE ON ERICA'S FACE - UPSIDE DOWN, hanging off the side of the bed. She's sweaty, flushed, overwhelmed...
</DIRECTION>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God, I do like sex.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA TWIRLS AROUND and we FIND HARRY, sprawled nearby, catching his breath, satisfied, stunned, scared.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You certainly do.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Erica arrives next to him, also out of breath.
</DIRECTION>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow. So this is what you're supposed to do on a rainy afternoon...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Harry smiles. He's trying to be his debonair self but something's off. He's very aware of himself. They lie there quietly for a second when Erica begins to tear up. Harry slowly, nervously turns to her.
</DIRECTION>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I really thought I was sorta closed for business. Just never expected this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<HARRY>

	Nothin's ever surprised me more...

HARRY FLOPS ONTO HIS BED

stares straight up at the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ERICA'S ROOM - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Erica gets back in her bed. She lies there for a second,securing her armor back in place. She routinely moves to the middle of the bed,neatens out the covers and shuts her eyes. Then a small KNOCK on her open door. She sees Harry in the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like to try sleeping with you.

The place is a mess, the aftermath of the storm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ERICA'S BEDROOM - THE SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry spoons with Erica on her side of 'the bed, his arms snuggly around her. The ELECTRICITY POPS BAGK ON and the room is suddenly lit up and one of Erica's French CDs comes on full blast. Harry opens his eyes. He's surprised to see he has his arm around her. Erica awakens just as surprised. In the light of day, a definite hint of embarrassment ...
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(grabs his watch, blinks)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you see this?

	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
(she turns)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are a woman to love.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Erica smiles, then walks away with the achey walk of a woman who hasn't had sex in many a year but has more than made up for it in the last 12 hours. She holds onto the wall as she exits the room, a little bow-legged, like she's just gotten off a horse. Alone in the hallway, she stops.
</DIRECTION>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are woman to love. What the hell does that mean?

<JULIAN>

	It's very common to become emotional after having an episode like you've had. Everything takes on a new meaning.

</JULIAN>
<HARRY>

(wiping his tears)

	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<JULIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you can expect just about anything right now. People have done some wild things after having a heart attack...selling businesses, getting divorced, moving... Some people say it saved their lives.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIAN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But most people go back to being themselves, right? I'll go back to being me, won't I?

	-- Look, I get that he has a right to get remarried, but he doesn't even know her and she's like my age. You know what that's like? It's like beyond creepy. And I know he's not replacing me so why does it feel like he is? This is crazy, right? Crying like this...

	<DIALOGUE>
	Mom, you want to know the answer to the big mystery of my life? Why I'm always with the wrong guy? This is why. Because the wrong guy can't do this to you. You have some control with the wrong guy. This thing I'm feeling right now. This is my big fear...that some guy could get me unglued like this, like nothing's connected. And this is just my father! I'm just not strong enough to handle this kind of drama.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVING IN ON ERICA

	Okay, not your problem. This is why I'm not good in relationships. You know writers are like teachers, those who can - do, those who can't - write romantic comedies where THIS does not happen in the third act...and it certainly does not happen to a 55 year old woman. In the play I'll be 36 so it won't be as pathetic. I'm just too old to feel crushed.I've written this feeling but I never really got it.

	What for? I saw your friend you were having dinner with, if that's what you want, it's never going to work with me. Look at me. I'm a middle aged woman, don't let this brown hair fool you, I don't have a real brown hair on my head, I'm almost all grey...that would freak you out, wouldn't it? And I have. high cholesterol and my back hurts every morning and I'm post menopausal and I have osteoperosis and I'm sure arthritis is just around the corner and I know you've seen my vericose veins.

	</DIALOGUE>

Erica hangs up, starts crying again. She takes off her glasses to wipe her eyes when she realizes she's holding Harry's glasses. Just the sight of them makes her burst into tears, the kind of tears that have been thirty years in the making.

<DIRECTION>
ERICA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
wakes up. As soon as her eyes open, she bursts into tears. While in the SHOWER, the crying never stops. While she EATS BREAKFAST, a downpour. Running ON THE BEACH, she's wailing. Back at the "COMPUTER, she's sobbing as her hands fly over the keys. An actual boo hoo can be heard. At NIGHT, laptop in bed, Erica writes, eating a bagel, wearing Harry's glasses and a pair of wrinkled pajamas, FRENCH MUSIC plays in the BG. At this point, she doesn't eVen" pay attention to her tears, just wipes and types when out of nowhere she receives an INSTANT MESSAGE from HARRY. He writes: Do I hear French Music? Shocked, she sits up, tries to fix her hair.

He writes: How are ya? She writes: Great... as, she wipes her tears on her sleeve. He writes:How's the writing going? She answers: Pouring out of me now. Go figure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He types: I miss y .. He stops, thinks before sending. Erica waits on her side. Nothing, is coming over. Then, on his side, he receives: Actually just running out. Take care... Harry deletes the I miss y... and instead writes: U 2. Erica slides down in her bed, wiped.

</LOWELL>
<HARRY>

Every little ache and pain scares the shitout of me...can't get a handle on my emotional life, don't know what I want, don't know if what I felt was because I just had a heart attack or was real. Plus, I feel needy. I never used that word in my life.

</MARIN>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not really. Sometimes. Not right now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<MARIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So now you get my theory about love? You gotta self protect. It's too dangerous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIN>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marin, that theory... how can I put this so your feelings won't get hurt. It's just so crazy, it makes me want to SCREAMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<MARIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And how would you put it if you wanted to hurt my feelings?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIN>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen to me... you cannot hide from love for the rest of your life because maybe it won't work out and maybe you'll become unglued. That's not a way to live.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<MARIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you're telling me you're happy right now? This is good what happened to you?

Marin's eyes fill up.

A PARTY is in progress. It's loud. The place is crawling with characters from the Hip Hop world. Harry winds his way down his crowded STAIRCASE, Girls grabbing at him as he passes by. As hard as he tries, he can't quite bring to life the guy he knew how to be.

Candlelit. Zoe, Erica and Julian share a bottle of wine and a home cooked meal. The CAMERA does a 360 around the table, their faces saying it all. The Women bask in Julian's warmth as he entertains them with stories. Zoe looks from Julian to Erica, relieved to see her sister smiling again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Erica places coffee cups in the sink. Julian is next to her, leaning against the counter, holding a glass of wine.
</DIRECTION>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Julian, I hope you know I'm mortified by my behavior. I was going to get in touch with you, send you a note or something...

</ERICA>
<JULIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A note? That's a little chilly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIAN>

</DIRECTION>
<JULIAN>

(still holding her, whispers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

On it is written: The lights on the Eiffel Tower dim to black as the music continues to play. Erica sits back, still wearing Harry's glasses. Finished at last. She notices an empty Kleenex box on her desk. She tosses it in a hook shot across the room and it lands right in the trash can.

<JULIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Must we go through this every time? Come here...

<PRETTY_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm totally excited about this audition. It's such a great part. It's supporting but she's a really funny character. There's this totally hilarious scene where she's dating this like chauvinist older guy and just as they're about to do it, the guy moans and she thinks he's just really into her, right? Except he's having a heart attack and she's like creeped out and her mother, who basically despises the guy, rushes in, gives him CPR and saves his life.

	Schmucks are people too you know. Death doesn't seem a little harsh?

<HARRY>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I e-mail it to you when I figure it out?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is perfect. I have given the `Can't We Be friends' speech for 40 years. I think I invented the 'Can't We Be Friends' speech. But you know what,now I get why they never went for it. You dames got one thing right. Sometimes sex does change everything. Call me crazy, but I just don't see us out on the town, being pals, having dinner, 'cause I'd bet you anything, at some point, one of us will have very unfriend like thoughts about the other then pass the bread becomes anything but pass the bread. You get what I'm saying?

	You don't want to be friends.

He looks different. He has a beard and has lost some weight: And in his eyes, a calm we haven't seen before. He pauses in front of the theater -- loo~s at the PUBLICITY PHOTOS. He SEES Henry in his boxer shorts at the refrigerator meeting "Emily" and her Sister. He sees ANOTHER PHOTO of The Dancing Henrys kicking up their legs like Rockettes. Then, finally, A PHOTO of Henry and Emily in bed, both wearing glasses. Harry OPENS THE DOOR TO THE THEATER, steps inside and listens, hearing Louis Armstrong's La Vie En Rose, then, the audience breaks out in LAUGHTER. Harry smiles to himself.

Erica sits alone at a table in the back of the room, drinking a glass of wine. She looks vibrant. She glances up from her drink and sees what looks like Harry making his way around the tables. She leans to the side for a better look, to make sure it's him. It is him and he's corning right toward her. Her stomach sinks, her mind races... and before she can come up with a single thought that makes any sense -- there he is.
