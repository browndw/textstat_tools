Grady--45-year-old novelist, professor, and insomniac--is in the midst of reading a story to the dozen college STUDENTS who make up his Advanced Writing Workshop.

	...listening to her father's boots scrape like chalk on the ancient steps of the church, then grow faint, then disappear altogether.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>

As he finishes, GRADY ponders a PAIR of MAINTENANCE MEN, perched on ladders in the quad below, stringing a LARGE BANNER between two bare trees. The BANNER reads:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WELCOME TO WORDFEST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY turns, peers at his students. They look as if they've been on a field trip to the DMV.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd) (a wave of the pages)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So. .Anyone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
A GIRL with jet-black hair turns to a PALE YOUNG MAN sitting at a desk in the back of the classroom. He is JAMES LEER, 19. Like GRADY a moment before, he is staring out the window.
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE_MCWHIRTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me get this straight. The girl with the big lips is depressed because, each night, when her father goes off to work at the bakery, her mother sneaks some mysterious lover into the house. Not only does this girl have to listen to her mother working this guy in the next room, she has to wash the sheets each morning before Daddy gets home. After a few weeks of this, she starts to go a little nutty/ so Daddy takes her to confession--only, once she gets in the box, she gets a whiff of the priest and realizes he's the mother's secret lover. Is that it?

James Leer says nothing, huddling lower in the PATTY OVERCOAT he wears.
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE_MCWHIRTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, Jesus. What is it with you Catholics?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE_MCWHIRTY>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right. Let's try to keep it constructive, shall we? Howard, what about you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<HOWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hated it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOWARD>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not exactly what I meant by constructive, Howard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<HOWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think James should try to be more constructive. This is my second semester with him. His stories are brutal, man. They make me want to kill myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOWARD>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY glances at James, but his face remains impassive. Then--with a visible sense of relief--GRADY notices the raised hand of the achingly beautiful HANNAH GREEN.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Hannah?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<HANNAH_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think maybe we're missing the point. It seems to me James' strength as a writer is that he doesn't take us by the hand. He treats us like adults. He respects us enough to forget us. That takes . . . courage .
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY nods, smiles subtly. Appreciative.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well put, Hannah. And a good note to end on, I think.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as the students rise)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't forget about WordFest this weekend. And remember: those of you driving V.I.P.s to tonight's cocktail party need to have them at the Chancellor's house no later than 5:30.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>

Hannah Green gathers her things, pauses by Grady.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks for that. He all right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<HANNAH_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>

</HANNAH_GREEN>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me? Sure. Why?

<HANNAH_GREEN>

GRADY watches her glide away in her CRACKED RED COWBOY BOOTS, then starts to exit himself.

<JAMES_LEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Turn out the light, please.

GRADY pauses, studying the wan figure sitting at the back of the classroom, then--reluctantly-hits the switch on the wail, leaving James Leer alone in the DARK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STAIRWELL/CORRIDOR - AFTERNOON (MOMENTS LATER)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY hurries down the steps, then spies SARA GASKSLL, 45, standing below. She is talking to a BOY with an armful of SLICK PROGRAMS.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
<DIRECTION>
(calm but firm)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Elliot, I said five hundred programs for today. This means we have no programs for the weekend. This means that tomorrow morning, at 9AM, several hundred people will walk into Thaw Hall and have absolutely no idea where they are going.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(shaking her head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all right, Elliot. I'll take care of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY watches Sara take the programs, turn, and spot him. There is the slightest of hesitations, then....

...TERRY CRABTREE--Grady's editor and friend-exits the tunnel with a STUNNING YOUNG WOMAN in a skin-tight black dress, bright red topcoat, and three-inch spike heels. Grinning devilishly, Crabtree whispers something in the woman's ear, then spots Grady.

</GRADY>
<CRABTREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perfect. Well then, shall we?

GRADY and Crabtree watch suitcases tumble as Miss Sloviak sits across the way, inspecting her face in a compact.

<CRABTREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know how many times I've boarded an airplane praying someone like her would sit down beside me? Particularly while I'm on my way to Pittsburgh.

<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lay off Pittsburgh. It's one of the great cities.

<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Isn't she?

</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
Crabtree ignores Grady's question, smiling placidly as he watches the carousel spin.
</DIRECTION>
<CRABTREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So how's the book?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRABTREE>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY stiffens. He had been expecting this, but not so soon. He tries to act casual.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's fine. It's done. Basically. I'm just sort of. ..tinkering with it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<CRABTREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great. I was hoping I could get a look at it sometime this weekend. Think that might be possible?

	I don't know. I'm sort of at a critical. . . juncture .

GRADY ponders this, troubled by it. Suddenly, Crabtree's face brightens again.
</DIRECTION>
<CRABTREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah. ..well now. What do you suppose that would be?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRABTREE>

GRADY turns, watches an immense PONY HIDE CASE drop onto the carousel.

As the Galaxie emerges from a TUNNEL, GRADY watches the great city of Pittsburgh reveal itself in the distance, then glances in the rearview mirror.

A YOUNG WOMAN with a crumpled PITTSBURGH STEEIERS UMBRELLA exits the building and-seeing GRADY parked in front of a fire hydrant--stops, a puzzled expression on her face. As she approaches, GRADY roils down the passenger window.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>

Through the windows, a rabble of writers, faculty and select students can be SEEN, mingling under a haze of cigarette smoke. GRADY brings the Galaxie to a lurching halt across the street, parks in front of another fire hydrant. As the trio steps out. MISS SLOVIAK notices a GREENHOUSE, shimmering quietly in the chill night air.

GRADY enters a room swimming in BASEBAIL MEMORABILIA. AUTOGRAPHED BASEBALLS abound, as well as PHOTOGRAPHS of famous big-leaguers. In one somewhat-dated PHOTO a TRIM MAN IN HIS FORTIES (a younger Walter Gaskell) stands with PITTSBURGH PIRATE BILL MAZEROSKI at an old-timers game. As Sara eases the door shut, GRADY nods to a 1951 YANKEE'S PENNANT hanging over the mantle.

Poe noses blindly through a forest of legs, pauses by Miss Sloviak's high heels and scores a Rye Krisp. Crabtree, returning with a pair of DRINKS, tiptoes around him, finds MISS SLOVIAK chatting with a trim MAN in his 50's.

<WALTER_GASKELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Joe DiMaggio. Simply put, Antonia, it' s my contention that their marriage tapped into the very id of American popular culture.

NEW ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY works his way through the crowd, spies Walter, and changes course. Directly ahead is an oddly commanding MAN ("Q"). From the behavior of the people in his vicinity it's clear he is someone of interest. Presently, he is putting the make on Hannah Green.
</DIRECTION>
<Q>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And while my latest has been on the New York Times bestseller list for 40 weeks, I can't help but lament that my first book, which contains what I consider my finest writing, was remaindered in less than five. So, I find myself conflicted.

	Q, Hannah's had two stories published in The Paris Review. You'd best dust off the 'A' material for her.

As GRADY moves off, he sees Poe sniffing, and goes the other way, heading directly into the crosshairs of a MAH IN TWEED, who is talking to another, shorter MAN.

The short man blinks, impulsively takes Grady's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<SHORT_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>

<WOMAN_WITH_CIGARETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>

EXT. REAR GASKELL HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY comes out the back: door and ferrets a JOINT from his pocket, lights it. He takes a long draw, walks around the side of the house. As he passes a window, a VOICE accosts him.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There you are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY starts, but when he looks through the window, he sees that the VOICE belongs to WALTER GASKELL and the person to whom he's talking is Sara. They are standing in the kitchen, near an elaborate WINE RACK.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could swear I had a '63 Chateau Latour in here. You haven't seen it, have you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I doubt I'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if I was sitting on it.

</SARA>
<WALTER>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Q certainly will. And, given that he will be addressing 500 people in little over an hour...

</WALTER>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to keep him happy.

<DIRECTION>
(kissing her as he exits)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm happy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
As Walter goes, GRADY studies Sara as she stands alone in the quiet little room, looking small and tired. Finally, she takes a breath, steeling herself, and moves off, returning to the clamor inside her house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY sighs, guilt-stricken, then detects a FLICKER of LIGHT coming from the darkness beyond. A FIGURE is watching him from the retaining wail that leads to the Gaskell's garage. GRADY blinks, chagrined that he's been caught eavesdropping, then his eyes narrow and he steps off the porch.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	James?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
James Leer wears the same nasty overcoat from class, a GREEN KNAPSACK hanging off one shoulder. GRADY looks at what appears to be a sliver of moonlight in James' palm.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES_LEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's fake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES_LEER>
<DIRECTION>
James' face betrays his own fragile chagrin and GRADY peers more closely at what lies in his extended hand. The sliver of moonlight is, in fact, a shiny PEARL-HANDLED PISTOL.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES_LEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was my mother's. She won it in a penny arcade in Baltimore when she was in Catholic school.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES_LEER>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's very convincing.

<JAMES_LEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It used to shoot these little paper caps, but they don't make them anymore. The caps.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES_LEER>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY reaches for the gun, but James closes his fingers and slips the tiny thing back into his overcoat.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES_LEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's just. ..for good luck. Some people carry rabbits' feet...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES_LEER>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...You carry firearms.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
As GRADY exhales a plume of smoke, James' eyes pass briefly over the jay. GRADY notices, offers.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES_LEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, thank you. I don't like to lose control of my emotions.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES_LEER>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY nods, accustomed to James' weirdness.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES_LEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not supposed to be here, in case you were wondering. I crashed. I mean, not intentionally...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES_LEER>
<DIRECTION>
James nods toward the house, where Hannah Green can be seen in a window, still fending off the determined Q.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES_LEER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...but the other night, Hannah and I were together, at the movies, and she asked me. Since she was coming. So I ended up coming. Too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES_LEER>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY nods, ponders this over-elaborate explanation.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you and Hannah seeing each other, James ?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<JAMES_LEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! What gave you that idea?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES_LEER>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Relax, James. I'm not her father. I just rent her a room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<JAMES_LEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She likes old movies like I do, that's ail.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(glancing back at the window)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Besides, she doesn't really know me. She thinks she does, but she doesn't. Maybe it's because she's Mormon and I'm Catholic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES_LEER>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe it's because she's beautiful and she knows it and try as she might to not let that screw her up, it's inevitable that it will in some way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
James looks away from the window, at Grady.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES_LEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not like my other teachers, Professor Tripp.

<JAMES_LEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh? Oh. Son or Fury. With Tyrone Power and Frances Farmer.

<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She went crazy, Frances Farmer.

	Well...

As James gazes off at the gloaming greenhouse, GRADY looks down at the left front POCKET of James' overcoat. Like a nervous tic, James' hand- hidden-twitches against the modest bulk of the cap gun.

James blinks, startled by Grady's laughter, startled that he's said something funny. He looks back to the greenhouse
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES_LEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, I saw the greenhouse. So I thought ...I thought I'd come out here and take a look at it. You don't see one of those every day. It looks like heaven...

</JAMES_LEER>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Heaven?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<JAMES_LEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I saw a movie once. Part of it took place in heaven. Everyone wore white and lived in crystal houses. Like that. At least that's the way I remember it...

Abruptly, James glances at his watch.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES_LEER>
	<DIALOGUE>

James turns away, then stops. He stands like this a moment, then turns back. Holds out his right hand.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Goodbye, Professor Tripp.

<GRADY>

<JAMES_LEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pier Angeli, 1971 or '72, also pills. Charles Boyer, 1978, pills again. Charles Butterworth, 1946, I think. In a car. Supposedly it was an accident, but, you know. . .
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a trace of irony)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was distraught. Dorothy Dandridge, she took pills in, like, 1965. Albert Dekker, 1968, he hung himself. He wrote his suicide note in lipstick on his stomach. Alan Ladd, '64, more pills, Carole Landis, pills again, I forget when. George Reeves, Superman on TV, shot himself. Jean Seberg/ pills of course, 1979. Everett Sioane-- he was good--pills. Margaret Sullavan, pills, Lupe Velez, a lot of pills. Gig Young. He shot himself and his wife in 1978. There are more but I don't know if you would have heard of them. Ross Alexander? Clara Blandick? Maggie McNamara? Gia Scaia?

James turns, finds Crabtree's laser eyes on him. James blinks, as if he had forgotten about Crabtree, then shrugs shyly, looks away.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES_LEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's just how my brain works, I guess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES_LEER>
<CRABTREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fascinating. Listen, why don't you come out with us after the lecture. There's a place on the Hill I always get Trip to take me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRABTREE>
<JAMES_LEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually. ..I just want to go home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES_LEER>
<CRABTREE>

	Oh, don't be silly. No one your age just wants to go home. Besides, faculty will be present. Just think of it as a field trip.

As he exits, CRABTREE raises an eyebrow to Grady, as if to say: "Bring him." MISS SLOVIAK follows, eyeing James glacially as we CUT TO:

GRADY and James Leer stand in the doorway. Just below the photograph of Marilyn and Joe--hanging next to a PIN- STRIPED JERSEY bearing the number 5--is a SHORT BLACK SATIN JACKET trimmed with an ERMINE COLLAR.

James swallows, then'-goes to the jacket. Carefully, he reaches out his fingers and touches the yellowed collar, barely making contact, as though it might crumble to dust.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES_LEER>

	They're glass. The buttons.

GRADY says this airily, ironically, riding his buzz a bit, but James nods solemnly, eyes transfixed on the jacket, as if Marilyn herself were inside it.

	She was small. Most people don't know that. The shoulders are small.

GRADY studies James as he takes the fringe of the jacket, lifts it lightly.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES_LEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's feels unreal, like butterfly wings or... something. It must've cost Dr. Gaskell a lot.

	I guess. Walter never tells Sara the truth about how much he pays for these things.

	Right.

A DOOR SLAMS downstairs and GRADY and James jump. The CLICK of a woman's HIGH HEELS sends GRADY to the bedroom window, where he watches Sara slide into a WHITE CITROEN DS23, turn on the ignition, and motor away.

Without thinking, GRADY flicks out the bedroom light, leaving James Leer in the dark for the second time today.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
James just sits there, a shadow in a room of shadows.

INT. HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LOW RUMBLE freezes GRADY as he enters the hail. A few feet away, Poe lies belly to the ground, his blind blue eyes trained, more or less, in Grady's direction.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Easy now. Eee-zy. . . .
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY starts to take a step, when.... Poe shoots forward and sinks himself deep into Grady's ankle.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY hops gracelessly, momentarily lifting Poe off the ground as he swings his leg up. Poe, countering, rolls his head in a snapping motion and drops GRADY in a clumsy heap.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get off of me, you son-of-a-bitch!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
Poe regains his feet, but doesn't let go, whipping his head back and forth, back and forth, over and over, growling low, dark, and hideously from the back of his throat, until there is a sharp...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CRACK! CRACK!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Poe YELPS, goes perfectly still, then topples heavily onto Grady's legs. GRADY turns. James Leer stands in the doorway, posed with the little pearl-handled pistol like Steve McQueen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY looks at James. Then Poe. Then back to James.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit, James. You shoe Dr. Gaskell's dog.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<JAMES_LEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had to. Didn't I?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES_LEER>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Couldn't you've just pulled him off me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<JAMES_LEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! He was crazy. I didn't-he looked-- 1 thought --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES_LEER>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, okay. Take it easy. Don't freak out on me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY roils down his sock. Apparently, Poe went through life with a slight overbite.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES_LEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you have a mirror? It's the best way to see if someone's breathing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES_LEER>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's dead, James. Believe me, I know a dead dog when I see one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
James looks miserably at Poe.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES_LEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are we going to do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES_LEER>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY rises awkwardly, holds out his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First you're going to give me that little cap gun of yours.

<GRADY>

<JAMES_LEER>

<DIRECTION>
James glances in the backseat, where Poe lies, strange blue eyes gleaming.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. I'm still trying to figure out how to tell the Chancellor I murdered her husband's dog.

	You?

	Trust me, James, when the family pet's been assassinated, the owner doesn't want to hear one of her students was the triggerman.

EXT. PARKING LOT -- THAW HALL (CAMPUS)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As sporadic APPLAUSE wafts from the high windowpanes of Thaw Hall, GRADY leans into the Galaxie's trunk, creates a space between the tuba and a ZIPPERED SUITCASE.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
James totters forward, arms hooked under Poe's front legs looking like a sorry marathon dancer. GRADY frowns, limps forward, and takes the hind legs.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES_LEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's still a little warm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES_LEER>
<DIRECTION>
They lay him down, push him deep into the trunk--until there is a SOUND like a pencil SNAPPING.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES_LEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yuck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES_LEER>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY grabs Crabtree's garment bag, frisks the pockets.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES_LEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a. big trunk. It fits a tuba, a suitcase, a dead dog, and a garment bag almost perfectly.

	Miss Sloviak's.

<JAMES_LEER>

	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES_LEER>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She is. Ah. Here we go...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY unravels a pair of boxer shorts, finds an airplane- size bottle of JACK DANIELS, then grabs another pair of boxers.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES_LEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. So. Is--is your friend Crabtree-- is he-- gay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES_LEER>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Most of the time he is, James. Some of the time he isn't. Now what do we have here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY rattles a prescription bottle, then shakes out a pair of WHITE PILLS, each etched with a tiny numeral 3.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looks like ...our old friend Mr. Codeine. That should take the pinch out of my ankle.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(handing the bottle to James)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<JAMES_LEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No thanks. I'm fine without them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES_LEER>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. That's why you were standing in the Chancellor's back yard twirling that little cap gun of yours tonight. You're fine, all right, you're fit as a fucking fiddle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY opens the tiny bottle of Jack with his teeth, drinks down two number 3's, then looks at James.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, James. I'm sorry I said that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
Recklessly, James takes a pill, tosses it in his mouth, and tips back the tiny bottle of Jack. Half a second later, he spits it all out. GRADY looks down, peels the soggy pill from the lapel of his jacket.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How 'bout we try that again.
	</DIALOGUE>

INT. AUDITORIUM - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the stage. Walter Gaskell stands alone at a podium.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...really needs no introduction. Walk down the aisle of any airplane or by the pool of any hotel and you'll see his face beaming back at you. You all know the name, you all know the books, so welcome if you will, the man those of us who know him simply call.. .Q.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
As the audience THUNDERS, GRADY and James slink into the auditorium. It's standing room only. As they head for an open space against the back wail, GRADY squeezes past a KID with a GOATEE .who regards him warily.
</DIRECTION>
<Q>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good evening.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Q>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY stares, over the gleaming sea of heads before him, watching as Q pauses, for a very long moment, waiting until the auditorium is consumed in a heavy, anticipatory hush. Finally, he speaks again.
</DIRECTION>
<Q>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am a writer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Q>
<DIRECTION>
As the audience EXPLODES with glee, GRADY frowns. He glances to his right, sees James' left brow crinkled with a similar look of bafflement.
</DIRECTION>
<Q>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As a writer, one thing you learn is that everyone you encounter has a story. Every bartender, every taxi driver, everybody has an idea or a. story that would make a "great book" or a "great movie." Presumably, each of you has an idea.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(gestures to the audience)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But, how do you go from there to here? How do you go from having an idea to having a book? How do you get across? What is the bridge, the bridge that allows you to walk on air from the shoreline of inspiration to the terra firma of accomplishment? Faith. Faith that your story is worth the telling, faith that you have the wherewithal to tell it, faith that the carefully woven structure you create won't collapse beneath you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</Q>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY glances at James, sees that his eyes are unblinking and glazed, then sees, beyond him, Sara standing by the far EXIT. A blink later, she is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<Q>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and faith that when you get to the other side someone will be waiting who gives a damn about the tale you have to tell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Q>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY leans back, listening to the BEATING of his own HEART, the soft GLIMMER of the chandeliers hanging by a thread forty feet above his head...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Abruptly, James LAUGHS OUT LOUD--some private amusement: bubbling up from the bottom or his brain and out into the auditorium. As Q looks and four hundred other heads turn, James ducks down--mortified. Crabtree, sitting a few rows away, studies James with amusement, then winks at Grady.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY blinks, turns to James.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be right back.

INT. LOBBY

INT. CORRIDOR

GRADY stumbles down the sloping carper, but the corridor begins to turn sideways on him and he stops, resting his cheek against the cool...cool...wall. ..as...ail..-goes....

<SARA_S_VOICE>

GRADY opens his eyes, finds Sara's face swimming above him. He is lying on his back in the corridor, his corduroy blazer bundled under his head like a pillow.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You had another one, didn't you? You have to see a doctor, Grady. First thing Monday morning. All right?

GRADY looks at his ankle and feels a rush of guilt.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to tell you something. Something.. .hard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
Sara's face stiffens, becomes more Chancelloresque.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then stand up. I'm too old for all this roiling around on the floor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY lets her pull him up, watches her light a cigarette.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well...

	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't. I know what you're going to say.

	No, really, Sara, I don't think you--

	You love Emily. I know that. And you need to stay with her.

<SARA>

	She'll come back. That's why I'm going to. ..to not have this baby.

GRADY watches her flip her hand up, bring the cigarette to her lips, and inhale ...then grimace and drop it to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not have it.

</GRADY>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. There's no way. I mean, don't you think there's no way?

	No you don't. And fuck you for saying you do. And fuck you for "saying. . .

Somewhere deep in the building, APPLAUSE swells.

	He must be finishing. We should go.

GRADY looks sadly at Sara then stoops to retrieve his coat. As he grabs it, James Leer's little pistol CLATTERS to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's gun is that?

Before GRADY can close his hand, Sara has it in her own.

INT. BOOTH

<DIRECTION>
As GRADY arrives, CRABTREE withdraws his hand delicately and James' eyes flutter open briefly, then close.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that just beer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<CRABTREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Primarily. Although I gather you two staged a little raid on the CRABTREE pharmacopoeia. You missed a few bottles, by the way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRABTREE>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sure. Where is everyone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<CRABTREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sara and Walter declined. Guess they wanted to go home and curl up on the couch with the dog.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRABTREE>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY cuts James a glance, trying to determine if he's copped on Poe, but James is winking out. His head drifts back against the wail, settles with a gentle ...thunk.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus. He's out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
CRABTREE glances over, nods.
</DIRECTION>
<CRABTREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He has a book.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRABTREE>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. He started it Fall semester.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<CRABTREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He finished it Winter Break.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRABTREE>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY looks up, unable to disguise his surprise. He glances at James' slack face tilted against the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<CRABTREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So. Is he any good?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRABTREE>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Not yet he isn't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<CRABTREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'm going to read it anyway.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRABTREE>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on. Crabs. Don't do this. He's . one o£ my students, for Christ sake. I'm not even sure if he's-
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<CRABTREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He is. Take my word for it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRABTREE>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think it's more complicated than that. Besides, he's a little...scattered. He almost ...did something stupid tonight. At least, I think so. Anyway, he doesn't need sexual confusion thrown into the stew right now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<CRABTREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	On the contrary, it 'could be just the ticket.

<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY notices the waitress's nametag (OOLA) and realizes she is conspicuously PREGNANT. He watches her disappear beyond the blur of bodies on the dancefloor, where Hannah Green's slinky form seizes his attention.
</DIRECTION>
<CRABTREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No sexual confusion there, eh, Professor?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRABTREE>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up and drink.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
CRABTREE grins, brings his bottle up, then stops.
</DIRECTION>
<CRABTREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my goodness. Do you see what I see?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRABTREE>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY follows Crabtree's glance and finds Oola again, but it's not Oola CRABTREE is eyeing, it's her CUSTOMER.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	President of the James Brown Hair Club For Men.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
Sitting alone in the dark booth is a SMALL BLACK MAN with big hands, a face peppered with scar tissue, and--most noticeably--a tsunami of hair sprouting from his scalp.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
(initiating an old game)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's a boxer. A flyweight.

<CRABTREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh uh. A jockey. His name's, um, Curtis.. .Curtis Hardapple.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRABTREE>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not Curtis.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<CRABTREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vernon, then. Vernon Hardapple. The scar's are from a--from a horse. He fell during a race and got trampled.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRABTREE>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And now he's addicted to painkillers.

</GRADY>
<CRABTREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He can't piss standing up anymore.

</CRABTREE>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He lives with his mother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<CRABTREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And he had a younger brother who . . .was . . . a. . .

</JAMES_LEER>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY and Crabtree turn to look at James Leer, who opens one bloodshot eye to regard them.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES_LEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vernon, over there, was in on the hit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES_LEER>
<DIRECTION>
James' eye closes. CRABTREE looks over at Grady.
</DIRECTION>
<CRABTREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRABTREE>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He heard everything we were saying.

Just then, Hannah Green bounces up in her red boots.

<HANNAH_GREEN>

</HANNAH_GREEN>

INT. DANCEFLOOR - MOMENTS LATER 30
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY and Hannah, reflected in bits and pieces in the jack 'o lantern wail of MIRRORED TILE, slow-dance to a sexy, measured blues.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNAH_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been re-reading Arsonist's Daughter. It's so beautiful, Grady. So natural. It's like ail your sentences always existed, just waiting around in Style Heaven, or wherever, for you to fetch them down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH_GREEN>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<HANNAH_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I love the inscription you wrote to me. Only I'm not quite the downy innocent you think I am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH_GREEN>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope that isn't true. We need all the downy innocents we can get.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY spies the corner table, watches CRABTREE say something to Q and then, casually, stroke a lock of hair from James Leer's forehead.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNAH_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what are you going to do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH_GREEN>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<HANNAH_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just mean, I--I guess Emily isn't going to be there when you get home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY looks down into Hannah's translucent face, then catches a glimpse of himself in the fractured, wail. The tile that would reflect his head is missing.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you holding me up or am I dragging you down?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
Hannah snuggles closer, lays her head on Grady's chest.

	Shush.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARKING LOT - HI-HAT CLUB (2 AM)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grady, limping on his bad ankle, carries James to Hannah's rumpled RENAULT, props him against the fender.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Hannah. When you get him home ...make sure he's ail right. Before you leave. Okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<HANNAH_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would if I knew where I was taking him.

</HANNAH_GREEN>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hannah, are you telling me you don't know where James Leer lives?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<HANNAH_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some apartment somewhere. But I've never seen it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH_GREEN>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That strikes me as odd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<HANNAH_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	James is odd. I know he has an aunt in Sewickley Heights. I dropped him there once, but...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(remembering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come to think of it, it-wasn't even his Aunt's house. He said she worked there. Or something. I don't remember.

James MUMBLES, starts to slide onto the hood of the car.

<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's he saying?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<HANNAH_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His bag. You know that ratty green thing he's always carrying around. He must've left it inside.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH_GREEN>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hh-uh. Last time I saw it was...

</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY glances at the idling Galaxie across the street. CRABTREE and Q huddle inside.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit. He must've left it back at Thaw. In the auditorium.
	</DIALOGUE>

GRADY frowns in annoyance, opens the passenger door.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right. Take him to my place. He can crash on the sofa.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<HANNAH_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The one in your office? It's the best one .for naps.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH_GREEN>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think it really matters, Hannah. We could probably stand him up in the garage with the snow shovels at this point.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
As GRADY lowers James into the seat, he WHIMPERS, curls into a bail. Hannah turns her puppy dog eyes on Grady.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ail right. In my office.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
As GRADY starts to turn away, Hannah's fingers graze his face.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNAH_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. If you want to talk later...I'll be up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY watches her fold her lovely self into the car and drive away. He sighs, crosses to the Galaxie, and just has his hand on the doorhandle when a TINY FIGURE appears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vernon Hardapple.

<VERNON_HARDAPPLE>

GRADY shakes his head wearily, opens the door.

<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go home to your mother, Vernon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GALAXIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY slides in next to Q, puts the car in gear, and starts to pull away. As he glances in the rearview, he sees CRABTREE smiling darkly in the backseat.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, what's the matter?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
CRABTREE just keeps smiling.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Christ, Crabs, what do you expect me to do? The kid's practically in a coma.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<CRABTREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tripp.

</CRABTREE>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.

</GRADY>
<CRABTREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hit your brakes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRABTREE>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY flicks his eyes from the rearview mirror just as a SHADOW looms in his headlights. As he squashes the break pedal, Q's EYEGLASSES go flying into the windshield.
</DIRECTION>
<Q>
<DIRECTION>
(squinting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God! What is that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Q>
<DIRECTION>
It's Vernon, waving his arms, his shadow enormous in the beams of light.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's this guy's problem?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<CRABTREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just go around him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRABTREE>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY taps the accelerator, but each time, Vernon dances back in front of Grady's grille.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<CRABTREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Back up. Go out the other way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRABTREE>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY throws the car in reverse, backs straight up, then turns up a one-way street. He shoots down the alley behind the Hi-Hat, turns onto the adjoining street, and watches in amazement as Vernon materializes from behind the high wooden fence that runs parallel to the Galaxie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As GRADY pinches the brakes, Vernon grins.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<Q>
<DIRECTION>
(mischievously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You could always go over him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Q>
<DIRECTION>
Then, as the three men watch, Vernon rocks back on his heels and--with a gymnast's precision-pitches himself onto the Galaxie's big hood. He -lands on his ass, slides smoothly off, then takes a deep bow and disappears into the night.
</DIRECTION>
<Q>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What just happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Q>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY peers at the wrinkled asterisk on his hood.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just had my car jumped on.

EXT. THAW HAIL - NIGHT (TWENTY MINUTES LATER)

INT. LOBBY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The JANITOR, the same shaggy-haired kid GRADY saw rigging the WordFest banner earlier, is struggling with a balky FLOOR WAXER as GRADY steps up to the double doors and slaps his hand against the glass.
</DIRECTION>
<JANITOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's open.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANITOR>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY pushes on the door and it opens.

	Oh.. .yeah.

<DIRECTION>
INT. AUDITORIUM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The knapsack is sitting on one of the metal folding chairs as Sam and GRADYenter the silent hail.
</DIRECTION>
<TRAXLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I saw the manuscript inside. So when you showed up, I figured. . .
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRAXLER>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY lifts the knapsack, peers inside. There is no title page to the MANUSCRIPT, Just the words The Love Parade and then, halfway down, TEXT.
</DIRECTION>
<TRAXLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it good?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRAXLER>
<GRADY>
<DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
EXT. THAW HALL - NIGHT - A MOMENT LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY steps outside, closes the flap of the knapsack and, hunching his shoulders against the cold... stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Crabtree. Q. The car. Gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRAXLER'S HONDA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Traxler gives GRADY a ride in his Honda, one of the original Hondas best suited for sidewalk driving. The backseat bulges with a huge AMPLIFIER and BASS GUITAR.
</DIRECTION>
<TRAXLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say, Professor Tripp, is ail that stuff true about Errol Flynn? How he used to put coke on his dick. To make himself, you know, like, last longer?

<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Christ, Traxler. How the hell should I know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<TRAXLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, jeez, you're reading his biography, aren't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRAXLER>
<DIRECTION>
Sam points and GRADY glances at the knapsack riding on the seat between him and Sam. A BOOK'-bearing ERROL FLYNN'S PICTURE--IS tucked into the side pouch.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, right. Yeah, that's true. He used to rub ail kinds of things on it. Paprika. Ground lamb.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<TRAXLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRAXLER>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SASKELL'S HOUSE - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam brings the car to a coughing idle across the street from the Gaskell's house.
</DIRECTION>
<TRAXLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow, check out that greenhouse. Is that your wife?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRAXLER>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY gazes at Sara, a .vaporous blur in the greenhouse.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, my wife's out of town.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
Just then, the Honda FILLS WITH LIGHT. HEADLIGHTS loom, then a POLICE CAR sweeps into the Gaskell's driveway. Walter appears on the front steps.
</DIRECTION>
<TRAXLER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's that guy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRAXLER>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Her husband.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
Traxler looks anxiously at the police car.
</DIRECTION>
<TRAXLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What exactly are we doing here, Professor Tripp?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRAXLER>
<GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
(staring at Sara)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Taking the long way home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GRADY'S HOUSE - NIGHT - A LITTLE LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Traxler drives away, GRADY mounts the porch with James Leer's knapsack hanging from one shoulder. He reaches above the door, feeling for a key, but his fingers come away with only dust. He stands, dispirited, then an idea strikes. He takes the doorknob, turns it. It opens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. .HALLWAY - GRADY'S HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY enters, closes the door quietly behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is dim but the TV is on, throwing crazy slashes of light onto the wails and ceiling. As GRADY limps by, he finds a sleeping Hannah Green, bundled in a blanket, T- shirt, and little else. On the floor, near her dangling hand, Woolf's A Common Reader lays open next to a Diet Coke. GRADY considers the smooth geography of her body, but his eyes 'are most powerfully drawn to. ..her feet. He steps forward, lifts the blanket gently, but finds-to his disappointment--only the red cowboy boots.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He picks up the remote, turns off the TV, and exits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GRADY'S OFFICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
James Leer slumbers on a green sofa, draped in an old sleeping bag. GRADY drops behind his desk, lets James' knapsack slide to the floor. He lifts his cuff, inspects his ugly ankle, then glimpses something in the knapsack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Something yellow. Something soft.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY reaches down and, slowly--like a magician producing a magical scarf-extracts MARILYN MONROE'S WEDDING JACKET from James Leer's ratty green knapsack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY glances at the young man on his sofa, then, looking very tired, reaches for the desk lamp ...and turns out the light on the both of them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FRONT PORCH - SATURDAY MORNING (NEXT DAY)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY steps outside in a WOMAN'S CHENILLE BATHROBE and plucks the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette from the second porch step. He fishes out a charred ROACH, starts to light it, then notices the Galaxie sitting in the driveway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GUEST BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As CRABTREE SNORES thunderously, GRADY eases open the door, spots the CAR KEYS on the dresser, grabs them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LANDING - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY eases the door shut, starts to turn, then stops, his eyes drawn to the door just across the landing from Crabtree's room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EMILY'S OFFICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY pushes open the door with the tips of his fingers, lets it glide open. The room that is revealed is bright and well-ordered, in direct contrast to the lazy clutter of Grady's office. There is a DRAFTING TABLE and a COMPUTER, pads and pens neatly arranged alongside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BULLITEN BOARD hangs on one wall, bearing an intricate mosaic of multi-colored index cards. There are PRINTS, framed, from various art exhibits, and two of Grady's DHSTJACKETS--including, most prominently, Arsonist's Daughter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There are PHOTOGRAPHS of EMILY too. In a black turtleneck with friends. In a sundress with Grady. In a billowing Burberry, floating like a dark butterfly against a BLUR of YELLOW TAXIS on a street in Manhattan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smiling brilliantly. Beautiful.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GRADY'S OFFICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY enters with a THERMOS--pauses--redistributes the sleeping bag over James Leer's pale body.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES_LEER>
<DIRECTION>
(without waking)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES_LEER>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're welcome.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>

GRADY sits at his desk, pours himself a cup of coffee from the thermos, then sets the cup directly in the center of a galaxy of previous coffee rings. Next, he takes a clean piece of paper, balls it up, and-with ritual precision-strokes it into the MINIATURE BASKETBALL HOOP that crowns the rim of the WASTE BASKET across the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All net.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A 9-VOLT CROWD ROAR belches from the hoop and, without further ceremony, GRADY turns to the blank page curling from his IBM SELECTRIC and SPACES to the top right corner, TYPES:

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	2611
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
In other words: Page 2611.

<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP - THE TYPEWRITER PAPER -- darkening with WORDS, the KEYS SNAPPING faster and faster, a CRAZY CLAMOR that grows and grows until, finally, it just ....Stops.

	James I
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY awakes with his back to the floor, James leer's quizzical face floating like a cloud above him.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm okay. I just lost my balance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<JAMES_LEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I put you on the floor.

</JAMES_LEER>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess you really miss her, huh?

</JAMES_LEER>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY peers down at the geraniums blooming on the pockets of the robe, its overall fuzziness.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh? Oh, no. This isn't Emily's. I just write in it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<JAMES_LEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess there's probably a story behind that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES_LEER>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is, but it's not that interesting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
James nods. Down the hallway, in another room, the TELEPHONE RINGS.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES_LEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Want me to get that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES_LEER>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure.

As James shuffles away in the sleeping bag, GRADY rises delicately and turns toward the window, just in time to see a POLICE CAR roil slowly by on the screen below.
</DIRECTION>

<JAMES_LEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The guy on the phone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES_LEER>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What'd he say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<JAMES_LEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He wanted to know if a GRADY Trip? lived here and drove a dark maroon 1966 Ford Galaxie 500 with black interior.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES_LEER>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What'd you tell him?

</GRADY>
<JAMES_LEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES_LEER>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good, James. If the Zodiac killer calls, be sure to mention the back door pops open with a couple hard shakes to the right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<JAMES_LEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought maybe you'd won a radio contest or something. Is that single-spaced?

James has noticed the towering stack of 20 Ib. bond on Grady's desk.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Afraid so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<JAMES_LEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a big book you're writing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES_LEER>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think it's sort of writing itself at this point.

	Wow, Hannah always swore you were working, but--
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES_LEER>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But . . . ?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<JAMES_LEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing, it's just that,, well, it's been awhile since Arsonist's Daughter, and some people--some of the kids in workshop--thought maybe you were...

	Ah. I don't believe in writer's block.

James takes another glance at the mammoth manuscript.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES_LEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No kidding.

</JAMES_LEER>
<DIRECTION>
A LOUD HACKING is HEARD. GRADY and James turn, watch Crabtree, wearing only a pair of striped boxers, materialize in the hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<CRABTREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good morning, boys. James.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRABTREE>
<DIRECTION>
James waves feebly from beneath the sleeping bag.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
(re: James' "attire")
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If-you 're planning on staying for breakfast, I'd put on something a little less comfortable if I were you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
As GRADY moves to his desk to reacquaint himself with the page curling from the typewriter, James continues to stare into the emptiness of the hallway. The sight of CRABTREE seems to have made him suddenly queasy.
</DIRECTION>

<GRADY>

<JAMES_LEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did I get here last night?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES_LEER>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No one seems to know where you live, James. Hannah thought you'd like my couch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<JAMES_LEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And ...and before that. Did I do anything? Anything bad?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES_LEER>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, James, you did shoot the Head of the English Department's dog and steal his most prized piece of memorabilia.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
As James contemplates this, the DOORBELL RINGS. GRADY looks up, sees the POLICE CAR he noticed earlier, now parked at the bottom of his driveway.

	Do yourself a favor, James ...Hide.

A POLICEMAN not much older than James Leer waits. As the door opens, GRADY appears.

	Good morning...

James lurks at the top of the stairs, swaddled in the sleeping bag, straining to hear.
</DIRECTION>
<OFFICER_PUPCIK>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...was just wondering if maybe you saw anyone. Someone you didn't know. Who seemed out of place. Suspicious maybe...

EXT. FRONT PORCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY is scratching his head in mock thought.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, there's always people you don't know at these things, but I can't say there was anybody particularly suspicious. ..Wait. There was one guy. Tiny fella. Claimed to be a jockey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<OFFICER_PUPCIK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A jockey? You mean, like--

Pupcik stops on his pad, looks up.

<OFFICER_PUPCIK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hardapple?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OFFICER_PUPCIK>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could be wrong. What happened anyway?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<OFFICER_PUPCIK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh? Oh, someone pulled a B&E on Dr. Gaskell's closet. And the dog's missing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OFFICER_PUPCIK>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's weird.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<OFFICER_PUPCIK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We figure the perpetrator let him out. He's blind and we figure he just wandered off and got run over.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OFFICER_PUPCIK>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The perpetrator.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<OFFICER_PUPCIK>

	No, the dog.

</OFFICER_PUPCIK>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just kidding.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
Pupcik nods slowly, as if re-filing GRADY under "Dealing With Assholes."
</DIRECTION>
<OFFICER_PUPCIK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One other thing. About this kid, this student of yours- Leer--James Leer. You wouldn't know how I could get in touch with him, would you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OFFICER_PUPCIK>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I might have his number on campus.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<OFFICER_PUPCIK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's all right. We'll find him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OFFICER_PUPCIK>

Pete Pupcik smiles, tips his big blue police hat, and turns away. GRADY frowns, starts to close the door...
</DIRECTION>
<HANNAH_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There you are...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY stiffens, then turns to find Hannah Green across the room in her t-shirt and cowboy boots, looking ail dewy- eyed and delectable.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNAH_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought we were going to talk. Last night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH_GREEN>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Well. I...

Hannah stretches and the t-shirt slides dangerously up her thighs.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNAH_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay. ..I'm here when you want me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY stands frozen as Hannah smiles sleepily, pushes through the swinging door into the kitchen. A THUMPING is heard as James, tangled in the sleeping bag, hitches down the last few steps of the stairway. He watches Pete Pupcik drive away in his big police car.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES_LEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do we do now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES_LEER>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY can reply, the TELEPHONE sitting on the table next to him RINGS.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Grady, it's Sara. Thank God you're there. You won't believe what's happened.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA_S_VOICE>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could you hold on a minute, honey?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
With a look of wonderment, GRADY watches his hand ever- so- gently ...hang up the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How 'bout we get the hell out of here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GRADY'S HOUSE - MORNING (MOMENTS LATER)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
James, now wearing one of Grady's flannel shirts beneath his ratty overcoat, follows Grady-to the Galaxie, knapsack swinging from his shoulder. GRADY tosses him a ring of KEYS.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You start her up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
As GRADY runs a plastic WEDGE over the GLAZE of ice blanketing the windshield, James stares curiously at the keys, as if they were some strange artifact, then slides behind the steering wheel.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES_LEER>
<DIRECTION>
(as the engine roars)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES_LEER>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well done, James.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
As GRADY works, James' face comes into view, then ...the wedge SNAPS, splintering into the flesh of Grady's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>

(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit!

James blinks, pokes his head out the window.

<JAMES_LEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're bleeding. Professor Tripp.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES_LEER>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AISLE - MARKET - MORNING (LATER)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY and James stand in the sundries aisle of a neighborhood MARKET. GRADY has a TIN of BAND-AIDS open and is presently plastering his ragged thumb.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where exactly do you live, James?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
James, in the midst of chugging from a 64-OUNCE JUG of ORANGE JUICE, stops.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Apparently not even Hannah Green has a clue as to the location of your apartment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY tosses the tin of band-aids into a small plastic hand basket, begins to move down the aisle.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES_LEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got kicked out. Well, not exactly kicked out. I was asked to leave.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES_LEER>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess there's probably a story behind that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<JAMES_LEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is, but it's not that interesting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES_LEER>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So where have you been staying?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<JAMES_LEER>
<DIRECTION>
(a long pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The bus station.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES_LEER>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY stares incredulously at James.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES_LEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not -so bad. I know the night janitor. And there's a broken locker I can put my stuff.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES_LEER>
<GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
(trying to fathom this)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But James. I mean. ..How long?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<JAMES_LEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A couple weeks. That's why... that's why I had the gun. For protection.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES_LEER>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, James, you should've told someone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<JAMES_LEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who?

<GRADY>

<DIRECTION>
(unconvincingly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY drops the basket at the check-out counter and, abruptly, finds himself face to face with a BABY, lolling on the shoulder of the woman before him. The baby is staring, spellbound, at a display of...Q'S LATEST PAPERBACK. GRADY frowns, then detects the true source of enchantment: a spray of SHINY MYLAR GIFT BALLOONS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A thought evolves.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd) (the balloons)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you think of these?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
James takes another chug from his jug, nods.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES_LEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES_LEER>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GASKELL HOUSE - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grady, squinting through the ten-inch panel of cleared ice on the windshield, roils slowly up onto the curb in front of Walter and Sara Gaskell's house ...then off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GALAXIE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY pops the glovebox, takes out a PEN, and scratches something on the GIFT CARD attached to the BALLOON. James glances briefly at a plump ZIPLOC OF POT stashed in the glovebox, then peers at the house.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES_LEER>
<DIRECTION>
(the house)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Isn't this...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES_LEER>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY gets out, then pauses, glancing at the giant orange juice jug between James legs. It's about half-down.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You better ease off that stuff, James. It's pretty acidic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
James takes a powdered donut that lies on his coat, studies it curiously.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES_LEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't help myself. I don't know what's the matter with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES_LEER>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit, James, you're hungover. What do you think's the matter with you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
As GRADY turns away, James ponders this, then considers the ring of white sugar imprinted on his coat and re-sets the donut in precisely the same place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GREENHOUSE - MOMENT LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the steamy panes, we SEE GRADY approach with the balloon, enter. He crosses to a high table, sets the balloon down, and steps back, considering the placement.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Feeling guilty?

GRADY jumps--startled--and turns. Sara has materialized behind a ficus, large POTTING GLOVES on her hands.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't believe you hung up on me, you dick.

	Totally. I'm sorry. A lot was happening this morning. Can you talk?

</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
Sara nods, moves the ficus to another table.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Walter's on campus, being the good soldier for WordFest. But he's a basket case. Someone stole Marilyn's jacket last night. And Poe's missing, too.

	Gee, Grady, that sounded so heartfelt. I don't know whether to swoon or smirk.

Sara holds up one gloved hand.

<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know that. I know what's at stake here...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I don't think you do. And besides... I haven't decided yet.

</SARA>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	About the baby.

</GRADY>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That ...and you.

<DIRECTION>
GRADY goes still, watches Sara strip off the gloves, drop them on a table.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not going to draw the map for you on this one, Grady. Times like these you have to do your own navigating.
	</DIALOGUE>

Sara turns to leave, then stops, squinting far down the street.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>

Sara raises an eyebrow, then pushes through the door.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Isn't he lucky.

</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY watches her ripple across the glass, head for the house, and wave. James, slumped low in the Galaxie, offers a limp hand in return, but it's too late.

She's already gone.

Grady, laboring badly on his ankle", enters and finds a DUFFEL BAG open on the floor, its contents a tangle of quickly-packed clothes. Everything else in the room feels of another time. PHOTOGRAPHS are everywhere, documenting a PRETTY GIRL'S life, from first recital to cap and gown.

	Well, it's infected, I can tell you that. I'm just going to clean it up a bit. It's up to you to-find someone who knows what they're doing. Here. Put your foot up.

GRADY puts his foot up on Hank's lazy-Boy, then notices a BOOK lying face down on the seat. The AUTHOR on the back cover looks as if he's trying very hard to look consequential. To his surprise, GRADY realizes the author is himself.

	So he's one of your students, this boy?

GRADY glances into the living room, where James and Irene sit on a long couch together, sipping something hot. James is looking out the window, a curious expression on his face. GRADY looks out his own window, sees the Newfoundland sniffing curiously at-the Galaxie's trunk. When he glances back into the living room, he and James make brief eye contact, then blink, look away.

	Okay, James, I wish you hadn't shot my girlfriend's dog. Even though Poe and I weren't exactly what you'd call simpatico, that's no reason for him to take two in the chest. Still, the fact remains that I'm the one who took you up into the Chancellor's bedroom. I'm the one who has to take the blame. I- don't know what the hell I was thinking.

James just blinks, no ready answer-available.

	That's why they all give you such a hard time in workshop.

</GRADY>
<JAMES_LEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because of my coat?

<GRADY>

<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up, James. You're annoying. Carrie and Howard don't know what the fuck they're talking about, okay? The entire class combined- including the lovely Hannah Green-has about one tenth of one percent the talent you have, okay?

James stares blankly at Grady, then turns his face to the window. He ponders Grady's words, the praise inherent in them. A hint of pleasure glints in his eyes.

	But, last night...

James turns, studies Grady's face as it flickers in the first headlights of the evening.

EXT. COFFEE SHOP/MOTEL - OFF THE HIGHWAY - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY rolls into a space near the coffee shop and James slides out. GRADY stays put, hands still on the wheel.

</JAMES_LEER>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In a minute. Get us a table.

</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
James nods, pushes past the glass doors into the coffee shop, and a big REDHEAD in a waitress cap leads him to a table with a view of the highway. GRADY watches James-- stick figure in black brogues--slide into the booth and open his big, laminated menu.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, as if concluding some internal debate, GRADY kicks open his door, steps out.

GRADY rests his forehead against the PAYPHONE as he speaks.

GRADY straightens up, takes a peek at James, sitting by himself on the far side of the coffee shop.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have no listing. Okay, well, lady-- at this very moment, as we speak, I'm looking of a resident of Carvel, Pennsylvania. I think he'd be pretty interested to learn that the good people of Bell Atlantic have misplaced his entire hometown. It's not like I'm making this up as I go along--

GRADY stops, his own words ringing in his head.

EXT. GALAXIE - PARKING LOT 74
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY upends James' knapsack, sifts through: An AUTOGRAPHED POSTCARD of FRANCES FARMER. A wrinkled box of CHICLETS. Nothing. Then he notices ERROL FLYNN'S eyebrows peeking at him from the knapsack's side pouch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes the book, opens it. Bingo. A library notice: James Seiwyn Leer is three weeks overdue. Under ADDRESS it says only: "On File." But if one was to dial the PHONE NUMBER, odds are it won't be the night janitor at the Greyhound depot who picks up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BOOTH - COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT (LATER)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The remains of a FRIED CLAM SANDWICH sit before James as he turns his attention to a GIANT PIECE OF LEMON MERINGUE PIE. GRADY sips only coffee, stealing glances at the cars that whip by on the highway beyond the window.

<JAMES_LEER>

<JAMES_LEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What would you call them then?

</JAMES_LEER>
<GRADY>

	I don't know. ...'Episodes.'

</GRADY>

James shrugs, spears a fluffy chunk of pie.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES_LEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's because you don't eat.

</JAMES_LEER>
<GRADY>

GRADY watches a pair of headlights approach...

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just worry about you, that's all.

...then pass. James' words finally register. GRADY looks at him.

<GRADY>

	You just worry about yourself, James. Okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<JAMES_LEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.

</JAMES_LEER>
<DIRECTION>
Just then, a long, pale WAND of LIGHT splinters against the coffee shop windows and a CAR sweeps into the parking lot. GRADY follows it with his eyes, rises.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

As GRADY limps out of the coffee shop, he finds an OLDER MAN in a TUXEDO standing in the open door of a gleaming BLACK MERCEDES. Beyond him, in the front passenger seat, a WOMAN in MINK examines her eye shadow in the tiny mirror of the sun visor.

	Well, certainly we'll reimburse you.

GRADY stares at-James wearily.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES_LEER>

	I swear. My father had his own airplane he used to fly up to Quebec. One Christmas, he and my mom were flying up to our house in the Laurentians when the plane went down. It was in the newspaper.

GRADY doesn't flinch, unpersuaded.

(nodding towards Amanda)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She makes me sleep in. the basement of my own house. It's mine. My parents left it to me.

GRADY glances toward the parking lot, studies the contours of Fred Leer's face. Frowns.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	James, come on. That man is obviously your father. You look just like him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>

James looks down at the table, takes a deep breath, and speaks in a voice heavy with implication.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES_LEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's a reason for that.

Grady's addled brain grapples with this dark little riddle, finally deciphers what James is suggesting.

Fred Leer hits the gas and swings the Mercedes around in a tight little arc, feathering Grady's pants--from the knee down--with a pudding of ICE and MUD. GRADY glances down at his spattered self, then notices, sitting on the front passenger seat, James' knapsack. GRADY grabs it, turns.

INT. GALAXIE - MOVING - TEN MINUTES LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CRABTREE snaps James' manuscript closed.
</DIRECTION>
<CRABTREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know--based on what I've read-- this is a very exciting piece of material, this Big Parade.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRABTREE>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Love. It's Love facade--and what do you mean 'based on what you've read'? You skimmed two chapters at 80 miles an hour while gargling methamphetamines.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<CRABTREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been doing this a long time, Tripp. I feel this kid in my bones.

</CRABTREE>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only in your bones?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY smirks, glances at Crabtree, but gets a surprise; CRABTREE offers no snappy come-back, no antic wordplay. He just stares out the window, his voice distant.
</DIRECTION>
<CRABTREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I think I might be right. I've felt it before...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRABTREE>
<DIRECTION>
As Crabtree's voice trails off, GRADY studies him.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How bad is it for you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<CRABTREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bad enough. And God knows I don't exactly fit the new corporate profile.

GRADY and CRABTREE look at each other a moment, then CRABTREE smiles, gives a little shrug, and picks up James' knapsack, rummaging through the contents.

EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - SEWICKLEY HEIGHTS 84-

The battered Galaxie floats up a narrow road, gliding through a canyon of mansion walls and the occasional winding drive. Up ahead a stone post marker with the numerals "262." GRADY kills the headlights.

Grady--limping like an aging prizefighter--leads CRABTREE up a steep incline toward an enormous three-story house. The Leer's Mercedes gleams in the shadows.

GRADY moves to the window and RAPS on the glass. A moment later, James peeks out. Seeing Grady, his face brightens briefly, unguarded, then quickly resumes its usual Leerian aspect. He motions with his hand, as if to say, "That way."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BASEMENT DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The DOOR swings open to reveal James Leer, decked out in a pair of RED, INK-STAINED PAJAMAS sagging badly in the seat. He looks like one of Santa's elves.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES_LEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. What are you guys doing here?

</JAMES_LEER>
<CRABTREE>

INT. JAMES' ROOM - BASEMENT 87
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Electric CANDELABRAS light a large converted cellar whose walls are crowded with MOVIE POSTERS and LOBBY CARDS. There are STACKS of what look suspiciously like LIBRARY BOOKS and an enormous BAROQUE BED, complete with CANOPY.
</DIRECTION>
<CRABTREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like what you've done with it. When's Captain Nemo moving in?

	Hey, I heard all about it--the parents, the grandparents, the China town thing-- and I believe you, okay? That's why we're here. Now go get dressed.

James scoops up the shirt GRADY lent him. this morning.

<JAMES_LEER>

	Can I--I mean--do you mind--if I wear this again. Professor Tripp?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES_LEER>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, wear whatever you want.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
James flinches, stung, then disappears into a bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<CRABTREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So modest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRABTREE>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So sensitive.

</GRADY>
<CRABTREE>
<DIRECTION>
(nosing around the room)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, come on, Tripp. Cut the kid some slack.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRABTREE>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's just ail that crap he spins out. Just once I'd like to know if the little bastard is telling the truth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<CRABTREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The-truth. I know that's always been real important to you. Key, check this out...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRABTREE>
<DIRECTION>
CRABTREE leans over an old ROYAL TYPEWRITER, reads from the freshly-typed PAGE curling from the carriage.
</DIRECTION>
<CRABTREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Finally, the door opened. It-was a shock to: see him, shuffling into the room like an aging prizefighter. Limping. Beaten.'
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(with an amused smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sound like anyone we know?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(resuming)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But it was later, when the great man squinted into the bitter glow or twilight...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(frowning)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bitter glow of twilight? This kid definitely needs an editor.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(resuming) ...and muttered simply, "It means nothing. All of it. Nothing," that the true shock came. It was then that the boy understood that his hero's true injuries lay hidden in a darker place. His heart...'
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CRABTREE stops abruptly.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes? 'His heart...'
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
CRABTREE hesitates, then... reads on:
</DIRECTION>
<CRABTREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'His heart, once capable of inspiring others so completely, could no longer inspire so much as itself. It beat now only out of habit. It beat now only because it could. '
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRABTREE>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY nods, his face unreadable, then James returns.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES_LEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm ready...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES_LEER>
<DIRECTION>
James stops, sees the two men looking at him.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES_LEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You all right, Professor Tripp?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES_LEER>
<CRABTREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's great. Come on, let's blow before ol' Gran decides to boil your bones for breakfast.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRABTREE>
<JAMES_LEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, well, that's just it. She's been coming down here, every half hour or so, to, sort of, check on me. If I'm not here, she might ...call the police or.. .something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES_LEER>
<CRABTREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hhhuh. So we decoy her. Stick a couple pillows and one of your teddy bears under the spread and she won't know the difference.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRABTREE>
<JAMES_LEER>
<DIRECTION>
(brightening)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Like in Against All Flags. Only they use a couple big hams.

	<DIALOGUE>
	No.

CRABTREE and James turn.

CUT TO: POE -- as he's lowered delicately onto James' bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JAMES' ROOM - BASEMENT (A FEW MINUTES LATER)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY strategically arranges the coverlet, gently adjusting Poe's head so only a TUFT of FUR shows. He steps back, joining CRABTREE and James for an assessment.

	Sweet dreams, Jimmy.

EXT. GRADY'S HOUSE - LATER

The lights are still blazing, the front door is wide open, but not a soul remains.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A quiet disaster, the only sound an LP playing meekly on the STEREO. James passes through first, ignoring the TORTILLA CHIPS POPPING under his shoes, then CRABTREE and GRADY appear.
</DIRECTION>
<CRABTREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Things must've picked up after we left.

CRABTREE pats Grady's cheek, heads upstairs.

</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing.

The door closes, the LATCH CLICKS, and GRADY is left alone, the bossa nova floating softly in the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HANNAH'S ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hannah Green lies tangled in the sheets, surrounded by little colonies of Grady's manuscript. GRADY studies her, then detects something on the floor. The red boots.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Delicately, he lifts the sheet. Hannah Green's feet-- finally revealed in ail their naked glory--prove to be thick, wide, and ordinary. GRADY sighs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GRADY'S OFFICE

The TV is on. GRADY steps to the doorway, pauses.

	It's cool, Jeff. Really.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. PORCH - GRADY'S HOUSE - NIGHT (A BIT LATER)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY sits quietly on the porch steps, a joint burning in his fingers. To his left, perched atop a Haagen-Dazs container, is a TELEPHONE. As he pulls it into his lap, a LAMP in the living room pirouettes clumsily, spins free of the cord, and SHATTERS on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY blinks, looks away, and DIALS, just as. ..the CLATTERING COUGH of an ENGINE is HEARD and a VAN appears. Stenciled on its side panel is:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kravnik's Sporting Goods
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The van slows, almost coasting, then abruptly bursts past Grady's house and disappears around the corner. GRADY frowns, then realizes a MAN'S VOICE is coming from the RECEIVER in his lap.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S. )
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello? Hello...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>

The VOICE is groggy. It is Walter Gaskell's voice.

<WALTER_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>

GRADY says nothing, as if wondering what he's doing.

<GRADY>

<GRADY>

</GRADY>
<WALTER_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me?

</WALTER_S_VOICE>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sara. I'm in love with her.

</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. Then Walter's VOICE returns: even, administrative.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you drinking. Professor Tripp? Right now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY sips on his roach, responds in a pinched voice.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<WALTER_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nevertheless, I'd like to see you in my office Monday morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER_S_VOICE>

As the line goes dead, GRADY stares at the phone, wondering if he has, in fact, just done what he thinks he's just done.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GRADY'S NEIGHBORHOOD - SUNDAY MORNING (NEXT DAY)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CAR rattles down the street, NEWSPAPERS pinwheeling from-the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GRADY'S OFFICE - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A heavy THHNK hits the driveway outside and GRADY blinks. Sitting in his pink robe, bleary-eyed, he reconsiders the piece of paper curling from his typewriter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY'S POV - of THE PAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's obvious he's been sitting like this for some time. Just then, the DISTINCTIVE PURR of an ENGINE is HEARD. GRADY peers through the window, watches a CAB. glide to the curb below. A Citroen DS23. Sara.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FRONT PORCH - GRADY'S HOUSE

GRADY steps onto the porch, unintentionally punting a BOTTLE of Iron City Beer onto the front lawn..

<SARA>

Sara leans down, replaces the uncradled phone.

	<DIALOGUE>
	...with your phone. Unfortunately, mine was ringing loud and clear this morning.

GRADY doesn't know what this means, but he's pretty sure it's not good.

<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh?

	<DIALOGUE>

</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
Sara raises her hand, silencing him.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not very happy with you right now, Grady. But more importantly, Walter's not very happy and he's gotten the police involved. They seem to think James Leer is somehow responsible for all of this. You wouldn't happen to know where James is, would you, Grady?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Inside.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>

	Honestly. Someone stole my car. I parked it right there last night.

<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you sure you parked it there?

</SARA>
<GRADY>

	Of course, I'm sure. Ah, Christ, the puberty police are back.

Hannah glances at the huge stack of paper sitting on her dresser, then, hesitantly, looks back to Grady.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNAH_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's just that, you know, I was thinking about how, in class, you're always telling us '-that writers make choices--at least the good ones. And, don't get me wrong. I'm not saying the book isn't really great-I mean, really great- but at times it's, well, very detailed, you know, with the genealogies of everyone's horses and ail the dental records and so on-and I don't know, maybe I'm wrong, but it sort of reads, in places, like, well, actually, like...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(with trepidation) ...you didn't make any choices at all. And I was wondering if it might not be different if, maybe, when you wrote, you weren't always ...under the influence.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
(stung)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hh huh. Well, thanks for the thought, but, as shocking as this may sound, I'm not the first writer to sip a little weed. And furthermore, it might interest you to know that one book I wrote, as you say, 'under the influence, ' happened to win a little something called the PEN award which, by the way, I accepted 'under the influence.

	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<CRABTREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In a sense.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRABTREE>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think so. In my experience, signs are usually a lot more subtle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<VERNON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me get this straight. All that paper that went into the river. That was the only copy?

	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<VERNON>
<DIRECTION>
(glowering at Crabtree)

	<DIALOGUE>
	And you're saying it's some kind of sign? What the fuck's the matter with you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERNON>
<CRABTREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm just saying that sometimes, subconsciously, a person will put themselves in a situation-perhaps even create that situation- in order to have an arena in which to work out an unresolved issue. It's a covert way, if you will, of addressing a problem.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRABTREE>
<DIRECTION>
Vernon stares at CRABTREE as if he's from another planet.
</DIRECTION>
<VERNON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll tell you the problem. You behind the wheel. There's your fucking problem.

<CRABTREE>

	That's pretty simplistic, don't you think?

	Hey, pal, you don't start doing crazy eights in the middle of the street none of this happens.

	Excuse me. Did you, or did you not, have a gun to his head?

	He was trying to steal my car!

</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
They ride in silence for a moment, then Oola turns, glances at GRADY and his little sheaf of pages.
</DIRECTION>
<OOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what was it about?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as GRADY looks up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your book. What was the story?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OOLA>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY stares into Oola's sweet, brown eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
Oola's brow wrinkles. CRABTREE glances at his old friend, genuine compassion in his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<CRABTREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What he means is, it's difficult to distill the essence of a book sometimes. It-lives in the mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRABTREE>
<VERNON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but you gotta know what it's about, right? I mean, if you didn't know what it was about, why were you writing it?

<GRADY>

	I couldn't stop.

EXT. CAMPUS ENTRANCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grady, James Leer's hollow knapsack in hand, stands with CRABTREE at the campus entrance as Vernon and Oola prepare to leave in the Galaxie.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Vernon. Can I ask you a question?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<VERNON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shoot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERNON>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY glances at little round Oola.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boy or girl?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<VERNON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As long as it looks like her, I don't care. You know what I'm saying?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERNON>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY watches Vernon give Oola a kiss on the forehead.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. Well, thanks. For the lift.

</GRADY>
<VERNON>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure.

</GRADY>
<VERNON>

CRABTREE leans into Grady, WHISPERS.

<CRABTREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The jacket, Tripp. We need the jacket.

</CRABTREE>
<GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, right. Oola. About that jacket...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<OOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yea?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OOLA>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY looks at the waitress in her pink jersey dress, snuggled up in the silk wedding jacket.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It used to belong to Marilyn Monroe. She had small shoulders, like you. Most people don't know that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
As Oola smiles, pleased, Vernon shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<VERNON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Man, that book of yours must've been one nutty motherfucking ride.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERNON>
<DIRECTION>
Vernon points an imaginary gun, fires a friendly cap into Grady, and pulls away. CRABTREE stands stunned.
</DIRECTION>
<CRABTREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mind explaining what you just did?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRABTREE>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY watches the shrinking Galaxie sail under a drooping NORDFEST BANNER, lost in thought.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Came to my senses. CRABTREE
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah. Well. Congratulations. Meanwhile, what is James supposed to do? Pray for Walter Gaskell to come to his?
	</DIALOGUE>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Walter Gaskell isn't going to send James Leer to jail, Crabs. I know that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<CRABTREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know he won't expel him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRABTREE>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. But I don't think that matters.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<CRABTREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's very enlightened, Professor. It's comforting to know that America's children have you for a teacher.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRABTREE>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY blinks, ponders this briefly, then looks toward the buildings of the campus, his VOICE still distant.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nobody teaches a writer anything. You tell them what you know. You tell them to find their voice and stick with it, because that's all you have in the end. You tell the ones who have it to keep at it and you tell the ones who don't to keep at it, too. Because that's the only way to get where you're going.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(ruefully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course, it helps if you know where you want to go.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(thoughtfully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe that's the only thing--that and Sara-- that's made the last seven years worthwhile.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY slides James' knapsack off his shoulder, smiles cryptically as he considers it. -
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As for James, he doesn't need me anymore...
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Without warning, GRADY tosses CRABTREE the knapsack.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's got you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
CRABTREE stares at the saggy green canvas in his hands, watches GRADY walk away.
</DIRECTION>
<CRABTREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me? What can I do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRABTREE>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gee, I don't know, Crabs...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(over his shoulder)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Improvise. You're good at that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY continues on, leaving CRABTREE to stand alone, as he walks toward the buildings in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<CRABTREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, Tripp.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRABTREE>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY stops, turns.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You peeked, didn't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<CRABTREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I peeked.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRABTREE>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY considers this. Nods. It-doesn't seem to matter anymore
</DIRECTION>
<CRABTREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It really had the makings, Tripp. There was a lot to admire. I've ...never read anything quite like it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRABTREE>
<DIRECTION>
If there was a Kentucky Derby for editorial bullshit, Crabtree's last three utterances would finish win, place, and show. And GRADY knows it.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not just trying to make me feel better?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
CRABTREE looks directly at Grady, his old friend.
</DIRECTION>
<CRABTREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Scout's honor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRABTREE>
<DIRECTION>
CRABTREE and GRADY stare into each other's eyes. Both are acutely aware of the subtext of this conversation.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, thanks for that, Crabs.

</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY - ENGLISH DEPARTMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dead quiet. Gradually, STEPS are heard, coming from the stairwell, then GRADY limps into view.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GRADY'S CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY surveys the room. Empty chairs. Empty desks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks to a WINDOW, the same window he stood at two afternoons ago when reading James Leer's story. A chill breeze pitches the fabric of his shirt as he studies the barren benches and icy walkways of the quad. Finally, he-. turns away, settles behind his desk and, reaching into his pocket, removes the seven remaining pages of his manuscript. He considers them, then folds them in half length-wise. He continues, folding the top right corner down into a triangle along the first crease...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. QUAD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A moment. Then-from the third floor window-a PAPER AIRPLANE glides into view, soaring then dropping, soaring then dropping, again and again, graceful as a dove.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOBBY - THAW HALL - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY hobbles into the lobby just as one of the auditorium doors swings open. APPLAUSE SWELLS and he spies Sara standing inside, talking to a STUDENT USHER.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sara!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
Sara turns ...as the door glides shut. As GRADY hustles forward, Q, wine glass in hand, intercepts him.
</DIRECTION>
<Q>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grady. I have to tell you. I took another look at Arsonist's Daughter the other night. There's a description of a bald cypress that left' me breathless.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Q>
<GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
(pushing past him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, Q. I felt the same way about the bank teller's breasts in your last one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BACK ROW - AUDITORIUM - THAW HALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY enters, but Sara is ...gone. He picks his way behind the back row, scanning the aisles.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL_S_VOICS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Professor Tripp.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL_S_VOICS>
<DIRECTION>
It's Carrie McWhirty, James' tormentor from workshop. GRADY takes another look around, then drops into the seat- next to her.
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE_MCWHIRTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you're looking for Hannah, she's on the aisle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE_MCWHIRTY>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
But GRADY looks anyway. Hannah sits a dozen rows down the aisle, hair pulled back in a clip, glorious skin gloaming. The Goatee Kid sits close beside her.
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE_MCWHIRTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's that guy she's with? Didn't he used to be in workshop?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE_MCWHIRTY>

	Jeff. He comes from a long line of tango dancers.

INT. MAIN STAGE

Walter turns over the last page of-his prepared notes.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And now, as those of you who've been with us in previous years know, we have a tradition of sorts here at WordFest. I'm speaking, of course, of The Plums.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
An anticipatory BUZZ sweeps through the audience as Walter begins to read from a separate list.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This weekend, Susan Lowery, of North Braddock, found a publisher for her children's book. The Loneliest Prawn, Susan, stand up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BACK ROW - THAW HALL^
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As a CHUBBY WOMAN stands to acknowledge the applause, GRADY cranes his neck, searching the sea of seats. To his surprise, he finds CRABTREE sitting prominently in the front row, in his shirtsleeves, smiling his spookily complacent smile. James is next to him, now wearing CRABTREE'S METALLIC SPORTS COAT over Grady's flannel shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And Robert Wilkenson--who many of you know for his City Beat column in the Post-Gazette--has found a home with Putnam for his new Three Rivers thriller. Blood Patterns. Robert.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
A SHORT, BALDING MAN stands briefly then Walter's VOICE takes a shift in tone.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, this next one, I think, is especially exciting to announce, because it concerns a student here at the university. Our own James Leer, a sophomore in English literature, has found a publisher for his first novel, which I believe is called The Lovely Parade.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY blinks, leans forward, and watches Walter smile warmly toward the front row. CRABTREE gives James a jab in the ribs and slowly, awkwardly, James rises. Stunned, Carrie McWhirty turns to the GIRL next to her.
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE_MCWHIRTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have a class with him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE_MCWHIRTY>
<DIRECTION>
James hangs-like a scarecrow from a nail, waiting as the APPLAUSE slows, then sputters, then dies out altogether.
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE_MCWHIRTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The guy's kind of an alien probe, if you know what I mean.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE_MCWHIRTY>
<DIRECTION>
Grady, in a last attempt to save James from himself, cups Hi his hands around his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take a bow, James!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
James turns, spots GRADY in the back row, then-a sheepish grin on his face--spreads his arms, hangs his head, and takes his first sweet public bow.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd) (softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wonder Boy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And finally--and perhaps not least importantly--Terry Crabtree, of Bartizan, has also decided to publish my own book--a critical exploration of the union of Marilyn Monroe and Joe DiMaggio and its function in American mythopoetics-which, tentatively, I've entitled The Last American Marriage. "
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Wild, obsequious APPLAUSE. GRADY smiles cynically, watches Walter take a brief, dignified bow of his own. . :
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Until next year. Thank you, everyone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
The LIGHTS come up. As the auditorium empties, CRABTREE shakes Walter's hand and Jeff and his goatee escort Hannah Green down the aisle, where she drapes her lovely arms around James.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY watches them ail, sitting alone in his row, when suddenly Sara appears over James' shoulder. She says something congratulatory, turns, and exits out a side door. GRADY blinks, scrambles up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CORRIDOR - THAW HALL - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY bursts into the corridor.'
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sara!

Its empty. Quiet. GRADY pauses. Somewhere, a HEAVY METAL DOOR CLOSES. GRADY rushes on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NEW CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grady, limping badly, turns a corner and sees a DOOR. He moves to it, pushes past...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and finds himself standing in a stairwell. He leans out over the railing, peers down. It's a steep drop, very. steep, ending in a small rectangular space, a kind of basement office, with VENDING MACHINES, PLASTIC CHAIRS, and a COLLAPSIBLE CARD TABLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY turns back to the door he came through, pushes against it. Locked. He sighs, looks back at the stairs, his ailing ankle, then sits. He fishes out the Ziploc of- marijuana, considers the perfectly roiled JOINT floating atop the bag of buds, but, for once, isn't up to it. The SOUND of FOOTSTEPS echoes far below and, hopeful they're Sara's, GRADY pulls himself up, peers over the railing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's Traxler, with a broom, a big plastic bag.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yo, Traxler.

GRADY considers the Ziploc in his hand, looks down again.

<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you get high, Sam?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<TRAXLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only when I'm working.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRAXLER>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY hangs-over the railing and lets fly the Ziploc. It pinwheels through the vortex of stairs, lands at Sam's feet.
</DIRECTION>
<TRAXLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holy shit. Are you serious?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRAXLER>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As a heart attack.

<TRAXLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks-Whoa, Professor Tripp, careful ^here...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRAXLER>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY is still hanging over the railing-but looking dizzy now. His eyelids flutter and he tips forward-a Steinway on a window ledge-and as he starts to drop...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...there is a SHARP JERK on his- COLLAR, a SHIRT BUTTON caroms off his cheek, and slowly, he is hauled back.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grady, what are you doing, you idiot?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY looks up into Sara's freckled face.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looking for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
He wants to say more, he opens his mouth, but then... ALL GOES BLACK AS SARA'S VOICE CALLS...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
faintly at first, then more forcefully, calling Grady's name, calling so insistently that the earth seems to RUSH upward until we see that she is...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KISSING him or something, and all goes softly... Blue.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY lies in a powder blue paper gown surrounded by blue plastic curtains in a blue room. Through a gap in the curtains, he can see the bottle of-GLUCOSE that drips slowly into his arm, and beyond, a window. Flakes of SNOW fall outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The DOOR SQUEALS, a SHADOW ripples across the blue, then the curtains part and a RESIDENT with a clipboard appears. His NAMETAG says GREENHUT.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I passed out.

Greenhut glances up, looking GRADY in the eyes for the first time, and GRADY stops.
</DIRECTION>
<GREENHUT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Mr. Tripp. You have a drug problem, all right? On top of that, you have a bite on your ankle that is severely infected. We pumped you with antibiotics so you'll be fine, but another day or two and you might have lost the foot. As for your spells. I'm guessing they're a result of the anxiety you've been experiencing lately.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREENHUT>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're anxiety attacks? That's a little disappointing.
	</DIALOGUE>

<GREENHUT>

	Better luck next time.

</GREENHUT>
<GRADY>

</GREENHUT>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to see her. As soon as possible.

</GRADY>

Greenhut studies Grady, calibrating the desperation in his eyes, then takes a quick glance at his watch.
</DIRECTION>
<GREENHUT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Mr. Tripp. If you really want to leave, I can't stop you. But I'm going to write you a prescription for a course of ampicillin and I want you to follow it to the end-no matter how stupid you decide to be with everything else. All right?

EXT. NURSERY - HOSPITAL - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY stares through the glass. There are only TWO BABIES on display, heads dented from natural delivery, skin purple and crazy with veins.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are these the only ones you have?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
The nurse's eyes crinkle.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kidding...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GASKELL HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY pays a TAXI CAB DRIVER, then turns, looks at the Gaskell house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FRONT DOOR - MOMENT LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY KNOCKS. Nothing. Peers into the living room window. Dark. He stands helplessly, then spies the greenhouse, standing ghostly across the yard, feathers of snow drifting onto its roof, melting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GREENHOUSE - MOMENT LATER12S
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY hobbles to the greenhouse, puts both hands to the glass as he looks inside. Quiet. Empty. Dispirited, he pulls away, but not before leaving...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...the IMPRINTS of his hands, perfectly etched in the frost of the glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET 127
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The snow continues to fall as GRADY lumbers down the street. Finally, wearily, he stops, sits his crippled self on the curb. He plunges his fist into his jacket and. ..straight through the lining, James Leer's silly little pistol at the end of his hand. He considers the pistol, then looks up into the sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY'S POV - of the SKY...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...dark and menacing. Suddenly, a THUNDERCLAP shatters the silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE - GRADY ...still sitting with the gun in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
(as if addressing God)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that a suggestion?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY sits, blinking the snow out of his eyes, then TWO SHAFTS of-LIGHT dance across his shoes. A white Citroen DS23 appears. It passes. Slows. Stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY stares at the car, burbling at the curb, then lifts himself up and makes his way to the driver's window. Sara makes a face, bugging her eyes a little-mad at him, but- not without humor. Then she rolls down the window.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm so glad to see you, Sara.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I believe you. Did that nice doctor let you out? Or-is this you improvising again, Grady?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm through improvising.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Terry told me about Wonder Boys. Is it true? Did you lose it all?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I lost it ail.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Grady. You're such a putz.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you're old.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
Sara strokes his scalp, takes a gray hair between her fingers. Yanks.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ouch. How many?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dozens. It's very sad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
Sara smiles at Grady, but the mischief leaves her eyes when she looks into his, and-she glances away.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I went and looked at-some babies just now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
(trying to make her laugh)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess you have to go on faith.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<SARA>
<DIRECTION>
(she doesn't)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some times...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY studies her as she traces her finger around the HOSPITAL BRACELET still encircling his wrist.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you tell Walter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told Walter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does he still love you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It didn't come up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY studies Sara's freckled cheeks, her anxious profile, then turns her chin gently toward him.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well I do. I've always loved you, Sara. I didn't know it at the time, but I'd always been waiting for you. My whole life. Because you're who I need. Because nothing makes sense without you. Because the best moment of every day is the moment I first see your face. And because when you leave a room, there's no reason to be in it any more. It's just a room again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
Sara cocks her head.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you just make that up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
(shaking his head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In the hospital. I "was kind of excited about it at-the time, but then I was on pretty heavy painkillers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
She frowns good-naturedly.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Even so...it's still true. Every word.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
Sara just nods, looks away, her face unreadable.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sara, I promise, even though commonsense might tell you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<DIRECTION>
Sara turns, puts a finger on GRADY's lips...
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't write a page when a paragraph will do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY nods, takes her hand. Looks at it as he speaks.
</DIRECTION>
<GRADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't deserve me, you know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRADY>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know, but sometimes...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
Sara turns, looks at Grady. Her eyes are glistening.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You just go on faith.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
GRADY looks into her eyes, then rises, and we do too, drifting above the streetlights as GRADY limps to the other side of the car and gets in. As GRADY snaps shut his door, the car drifts off, gradually losing itself in- the soft veil of falling snow. After a moment, GRADY and Sara are lost too, nothing more than a blur.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
