EXT. NEW MEXICO DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY (PRESENT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A black scorpion crawls towards us on hot tarmac. The sound of an approaching PICKUP. A tire crushes the life from the scorpion, CAMERA rising from it to reveal a desolate DINER in the middle of nowhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DINER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MICKEY KNOX, his back turned to us, is sitting at the counter finishing his meal. We hear the PING...BANG...of a pinball machine being played OFF SCREEN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MABEL, a waitress, comes over and fills Mickey's coffee cup.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What kind of pies do you have?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<MABEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MABEL>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which do you recommend?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<MABEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, the key lime is great, but it's an acquired taste.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MABEL>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I haven't had a key lime pie in ten years.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<MABEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When ya had it, did ya like it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MABEL>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, but that don't mean much. I was a completely different person ten years ago. Let's give key lime a day in court. And a large glass of milk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
Mabel turns to her right.
</DIRECTION>
<MABEL>
<DIRECTION>
(to someone O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Should I make that two pieces?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MABEL>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PULLS BACK and we see for the first time MALLORY KNOX, Mickey's wife, sitting on a counter stool next to him. Her back is to the camera as well.
</DIRECTION>
<MALLORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nada, Rosey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALLORY>
<MABEL>
<DIRECTION>
(annoyed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My name's not Rosey.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(points at name tag)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's Mabel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MABEL>
<DIRECTION>
Mabel exits FRAME.
</DIRECTION>
<MALLORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALLORY>
<DIRECTION>
Mallory hops from the stool, walks over and grabs the JAR next to the cash register, then dumping out the coins on the counter, she selects a quarter.
</DIRECTION>
<MABEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, what the hell do you think you're doin'?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MABEL>
<DIRECTION>
Mallory saunters past the COWBOY playing pinball. As his eyes follow Mallory, he loses his ball.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She walks to the jukebox in the back, inserts the quarter, selects a song, punches the buttons, a needle lands on a record, and a hard-hitting rockabilly TUNE cuts through the coffee shop. (Suggestions: "Let 'er Roll" by Sid King or "Red Hot"/"The Way I Walk" by Robert Gordon)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mabel brings Mickey his pie and milk.
</DIRECTION>
<MABEL>
<DIRECTION>
(to Mickey)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She ought not be doing that. That's for Jerry's kids, not rock 'n roll.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MABEL>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA moves around to a CU of Mickey. This is the first time we see him. As he takes a bite of green pie:
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't take her anywhere.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
Mallory starts doing a slow seductive fandango around the coffee shop. She's really cooking and smoking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pinball Cowboy and Mabel are starting to wonder just who the hell these people are.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A dirty pickup truck, sporting a Confederate flag decal, pulls up to the coffee shop, a DEAD DEER in the back. SONNY, OTIS, and EARL, three tough-looking rednecks, pile out. Steam rises from beneath the pickup's hood.
</DIRECTION>
<EARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goddamn this sonbitch is runnin' hot. Y'all go inside. I'm gonna check 'er out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARL>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The LOUDNESS of the Rockabilly song slaps SONNY and OTIS in their faces as they walk inside the door. The sexy sight of MALLORY doing the ubang stomp stops them in their tracks.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good God almighty. What the hell is that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<OTIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a bitch outta hell, son.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTIS>
<DIRECTION>
Otis and Sonny exchange looks.
</DIRECTION>
<OTIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take a run at 'er, kiddo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTIS>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny heads toward Mallory. Otis moves over to the counter next to Mickey.
</DIRECTION>
<OTIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miller, Mabel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTIS>
<MABEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Comin' up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MABEL>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny stands in front of Mallory, trying to copy what she's doing. Her eyes are closed at the moment, so she doesn't see him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mabel sets the Miller down in front of Otis. Otis takes a swig, enjoying the floor show.
</DIRECTION>
<OTIS>
<DIRECTION>
(to Mickey)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's some sweet piece of meat, ain't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTIS>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey turns from his pie and looks at Otis. His expression betrays nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Her name's Mallory.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<OTIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mallory, whatever -- who gives a shit. I call it pussy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTIS>
<DIRECTION>
The needle lifts off the record. The song ends.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mallory opens her eyes and sees Sonny, grinding up against her, grabbing for her tits.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hells Bells! Don't stop now sugar. I'm just getting warmed up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny gives her his best shit-eating grin before turning to Otis. Otis gurgles out a laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<OTIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, I think she's sweet on you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTIS>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny turns to Mallory.
</DIRECTION>
<MALLORY>
<DIRECTION>
(sweet)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, are you flirting with me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALLORY>
<DIRECTION>
She starts to sing "Shitlist" by L7. Sonny doesn't understand as she punches him hard in the face, spinning him around. More punches follow as she wallops him all over the diner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A new song automatically drops on -- Patti Smith's "Rock 'n Roll Nigger" or L7's "Shitlist" pumping the room to a new peak of murder and insanity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mallory grabs the back of Sonny's head and SMASHES it down on the table, cracking the linoleum.
</DIRECTION>
<MALLORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't fuck with my dance! Goddamnit Mickey, why do they fuck with my dance, goddamn is it be- cause I'm so cute? Why are they fucking with me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALLORY>
<DIRECTION>
Otis jumps off the counter stool, but Mickey's hand clutches hold of his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Otis spins around toward Mickey, loaded for bear, and points his finger at him, threateningly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Before any threat can be made, Mickey whips a large buck knife out from its sheath, and in a flash, SLICES off Otis' finger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Otis' finger drops on his boot. He grabs his aching hand. Blood flows from the wound.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just because my woman's mopping up the floor with your buddy is no reason for you to join in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey makes five lightning quick SLASHING SWINGS. The buck knife slips back into its sheath. At first, there seems to be no difference with Otis. Finally, blood flows from the slices made in his face and chest. Otis collapses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SHORT-ORDER COOK in a hairnet charges out of the kitchen at Mickey, wielding a meat cleaver and screaming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey whips out a .45 automatic from a shoulder holster inside his jacket and FIRES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BULLET'S POV: Heading fast toward Short-Order Cook's face. It HITS. Short-Order Cook puts his hands to his face and falls to the ground, screaming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey spots Earl, who's standing outside the plate glass window. Earl's watched the whole shebang.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Earl mouths "Fuck!" He turns and runs for it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey hurls the knife through the plate glass window, which SHATTERS. The knife PLUNGES deep into Earls back. He hits the ground dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey turns to Mallory. She's sitting on top of Sonny, SLAMMING his head repeatedly on the floor. He's dead, she's still singing.
</DIRECTION>
<MALLORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	..."you made my ... shitlist!"
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALLORY>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
Mallory looks up at Mickey. She gets off Sonny and moves to Mickey's side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey trains his .45 on Pinball Cowboy, who's shaking in his cowboy boots. Mickey aims at Mabel, who's clutching the coffee pot, crying.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(to Mallory)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pick one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
Mallory does eanie, meanie, minie, moe, pointing back and forth from Mabel to Pinball Cowboy. Twice the jingle lands on the cowboy, but Mallory adds another phrase...
</DIRECTION>
<MALLORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eanie, meanie, minie, moe, catch a redneck by the toe. If he hollers, let him go. Eanie, meanie, minie, moe. My mom told me to pick the best one ... and you are it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALLORY>
<DIRECTION>
...so that she ends on Mabel. Mabel's dodging around screaming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey FIRES the .45. The bullet CHINKS through the coffee pot Mabel's holding and explodes, THUNKING her in the chest. She hits the floor dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey and Mallory join hands and walk over to the Pinball Cowboy who stands in a pool of his own urine.
</DIRECTION>
<MALLORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When you tell people what went on here, tell 'em Mickey and Mallory Knox was here. Say it.

TITLE SEQUENCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONVERTIBLE CAR - MOVING - DAY (PROCESS SHOT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"Rock 'n Roll Nigger"/"Shitlist" blends into a PROCESS SHOT of plates of the Southwest USA (Shiprock, buttes, mesas, Rio Grande, Indian Reservation), mixed with the Midwest, Alaska -- the country on the move.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Song Track acquires a second and possibly third song, all clashing on the track at the same time (possibly older fare like Duane Eddy's "Rebel Rouser" or Shangri-La's "Leader of the Pack" with some "Madame Butterfly" thrown in). The TITLES splash over this with big Rock Hudson/"Giant" '50's-style block lettering.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the foreground (possibly grainy, black-and-white 16 mm, "Breathless" style cinema verite), MICKEY drives a 70's type American muscle car fast (Suggestions: a Plymouth Cuda, Dodge Challenger, Coup de Ville Cadillac). Buffalo grass blurs by. White clouds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then some RAIN. The top is down. They are wet and laughing. A bottle of tequila lays between them. She turns the radio up louder...and louder. Micket drives faster ... and faster. The car feels like it's taking flight. The wind, the music -- everything merges.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAR crashes off the road, through a barbed wire fence, fishtails -- races on, mowing through brush.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey floors it and howls to get 400 horses under control. MALLORY yells. Can you believe? Can you see Life in Death?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NIGHT - STARS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A vault of Southwest Stars, clean as milk, pouring down on the TWO LOVERS in the middle of nowhere. Mickey peeing in the dark. Softer Music (Cowboy Junkies' "Sweet Jane" style).
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goddamn! Looks like the world's comin' to an end, Mall.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
Mallory is dancing barefoot on the hood of the car. As she sings/talks, the stars become light-moving explosions into the earth.
</DIRECTION>
<MALLORY>
<DIRECTION>
(dreamy, looking up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see angels Mickey ... comin' down for us from heaven. I feel their feathered wings ... I see you ridin' a red horse, drivin' the horses, whippin' 'em -- they're spittin', frothin' all over the mouth -- comin' right at us...I see the future...and there's no death Mickey...cause you and I are angels.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALLORY>
<DIRECTION>
She gets out of the car. Mickey, buttoning up, turns to look at her for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's goddamn poetry...damn I love you Mall.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
In the shadows, we see her little devil grinning back at him, as she pees. Light on her flanks. She's singing "Ain't Nobody's Business" by Billy Holiday.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TITLES END.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WINSLOW/GALLUP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MICKEY and MALLORY drive into a quiet one-street town on Rt. 666.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car is parked outside a cheap MOTEL in the middle of nowhere. The sign reads "FREE HBO."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MALLORY is drying her hair, in a slip.
</DIRECTION>
<MALLORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wanna go out? Get somethin' to eat?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALLORY>
<DIRECTION>
No answer. The TV's on to "Thelma and Louise" blasting it out with the cops. MICKEY has a copy of TV Guide in his hands, worn out.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</MALLORY>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you been thinkin' bout cutting your hair short.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
She steps on the bed and sits on her knees, snuggles. She puts her head on his shoulder and he traces the line from her eyebrows down through her nose and chin. She's like a cat, purring, nestling for his warmth.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you been thinkin' bout us settlin' down -- on a boat in the middle of a big lake, with a dog and a juke box.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
Mallory wraps her arms around his chest, nibbles his neck. What she never felt in her father's house -- a warmth.
</DIRECTION>
<MALLORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Mick, I love it when you can read my mind. I bet I know what you been thinkin' bout?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALLORY>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey flicks to "Scarface" -- the chainsaw scene.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, why they make all these fuckin' stupid movies. Don't they believe in kissin' anymore! I tell ya out there in Hollywood somebody's a taco short of a combo plate.

He gives her a big kiss. She smiles.

	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(notices)... where is it?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her wedding ring is missing. He glares at her hard, grabbing her wrist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA suddenly hauls ass from the bedroom back through the bathroom door and careens towards the sink. It STOPS at a soap dish. There, bigger than life, is Mallory's WEDDING RING. A diamond to light up the sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her hand comes into FRAME, grabs it and exits FRAME.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mallory jumps back in bed with Mickey, waving her ring.
</DIRECTION>
<MALLORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Calm down Mickey! I just took it off so it wouldn't snag when I washed my hair, goddamn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALLORY>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey flicks the remote to a "Game Show" -- a new refrigerator, a miniature swimming pool, and a new car are given away in a rapid sequence. Mickey throws her perturbed looks inbetween:
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Even if that ring pulls out every hair on your head, it never comes off. If it scratches my face, it never comes off. If it tears out my eyes, it never comes off. Every great thing we do, starts with these.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey clicks their wedding rings together. Mallory, excited, kisses him in great slurps of lust as Mickey flicks to a "Nature Show" -- Insects devour insects. Who eats who, and where.
</DIRECTION>
<MALLORY>
<DIRECTION>
(sexy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you put it that way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALLORY>
<DIRECTION>
She makes love to him under the sheets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the TV, a praying mantis swallows a bug.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey, a love crazed guy, splits his looks between the TV and something in the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>

	</DIALOGUE>
</MALLORY>
<DIRECTION>
It could be the TV he's looking at; we're not sure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mallory stops humping him, looks at her ring. He blows some hair out of her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mallory, frustrated, gets off him, throws a jacket over her slip, adjusts her highheels.
</DIRECTION>
<MALLORY>

	Hold it? Weren't we going to do something with her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PANS, with Mallory on the way out to the corner of the motel room. A young GIRL is tied up, her mouth taped shut, her eyes bugging out of their sockets, she's so scared.
</DIRECTION>
<MALLORY>
<DIRECTION>

MALLORY drives, top down, through a truckstop town. It's a hot night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COYOTE catch MICE drawn to the street lights. A little outside town, MALLORY'S pulled into an all-night gas station. Bugs fly around the neon. The radio in the car is on to something like "Ted Just Admit It" from Jane's Addiction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A YOUNG GAS ATTENDANT slides out from under a Corvette he's working on in the garage. He puts on his greasy cowboy hat and walks up to her car.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That'll be seventeen bucks lady. Say, don't I know you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ATTENDANT>
<DIRECTION>
Mallory leans into his face, a yearning. She takes his hand, feels it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks, wondering, surprised. There's something so needy, so desperate in Mallory's child-like eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She takes his hand and runs it up inside her shirt, muttering.
</DIRECTION>
<MALLORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you just feel me...tell me you want me...think I'm sexy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALLORY>
<DIRECTION>
His hands feel her up. She presses her lips to his neck, nibbling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A brief flashing image of MICKEY passes before her eyes. It's him in front of her.
</DIRECTION>
<MALLORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...come on, say it more...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALLORY>
<DIRECTION>
His hands get rough, taking the lead. She doesn't want that. She pushes his head down, deflecting his agressivity. (..."go down") Camera dwells on her leaning back on the Corvette as he is he is beneath her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But he is rough, and pops his head back up and smothers her on the top of the hood. His blackened hands starting to push and knead her roughly.
</DIRECTION>
<ATTENDANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh baby! You are sexy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ATTENDANT>
<DIRECTION>
She is increasingly agitated, coming out of her reverie. This is obviously not Mickey.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He spreads her hard across the hood and spreads her legs in a vee.
</DIRECTION>

</MALLORY>
<DIRECTION>
She kicks him hard, freeing her legs. He falls off the hood. She gets the gun from her purse and fires an angry SHOT into him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is ranting as she kicks him and steps over him.
</DIRECTION>
<MALLORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Next time don't be so fuckin' eager...that was the worst fuckin' head I've ever had in my life.

INT. GAS STATION - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Peering at Mallory's underwear, JACK SCAGNETTI expresses reverence, moving his attention to the hood of the Corvette, dusted with crime powder. He's a cop, one of the best. He consults a LOCAL COWBOY SHERIFF.
</DIRECTION>
<SCAGNETTI>

INT. INDIAN CAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Closer -- stoic INDIAN EYES under a tribal baseball cap. Just looking, tagging -- not on the radio or anything.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MICKEY'S CAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CU on a state road MAP showing Indian Reservation symbols. Up to MALLORY.
</DIRECTION>
<MALLORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be cool -- take the next right. Looks like a town out there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALLORY>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All I see is desert.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
MICKEY turns onto a dirt road off the Highway. A cloud of dust.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They look back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Indian slows to a crawl, watching them...then goes past, down the main road.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(relieved)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right Cochise, go eat some more fried bread...Gimme some more mushrooms.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
Mallory reaches for the mushrooms -- gives him a couple of dry chewy puips. He gnashes on them. The radio's been playing something zonal like "Alive" by Pearl Jam or "Dizz Knee Land" by Dada.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DIRT ROAD - LATER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They have run out of gas in the middle of nowhere. Red earth. Sky. Clouds. A thrush calls out a song.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MICKEY is staggering, besotted with mushroom power. Sticks his gun in his belt, begins walking up the road looking for gas.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit. Right now I'd go down on a lawman for a gallon of gas...do I have something on my nose?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>

<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Snakes, birds, nothin' out here. "Turn right?" Turn right to what? You fuckin' stupid bitch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
She punches him right in the face. Then she kicks him to the ground. On the ground he tries a savate kick. She sees it coming, jumps over him and lands right on him, gun in his forehead.
</DIRECTION>
<MALLORY>
<DIRECTION>
(mocking)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"You stupid bitch! You stupid bitch! You stupid bitch!!" Don't call me bitch. My father called me that. Once too much. You're losing it, Mickey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALLORY>
<DIRECTION>
He has a tooth loosened.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure Mall, take it easy...it's me, your lover, not some demon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<MALLORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do I know that? Take off your pants and gimme your money...now. I'm serious.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALLORY>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mall! I don't have to be dictated to by a woman...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<MALLORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shoes too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALLORY>
<DIRECTION>
She fires. Into the ground. Right next to him. He hops to comply.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you gonna do? Leave me. Just cause I don't have the goddamn same puritanical belief systems you do! What the fuck is that gonna...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
She fires again. Speed it up. He senses she's really pissed.
</DIRECTION>
<MALLORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mickey, you gotta get respect for me...turn around and drop your knickers. I want to see your ass up in the air.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALLORY>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mall! What the hell game is this!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
She fires again. The shots bring the sound of BELLS jingling. They look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On a KNOLL fifty feet away stands a flock of RAMS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Conversely, the Rams' POV is of a near-naked man and a woman with a gun in the desert. The Chief RAM tears out after Mickey.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the fuck!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to run.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shoot it! Goddamn Mall, shoot the fucker!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
Mallory laughs as the ram closes on Mickey. But the Ram comes to an abrupt stop as it hears the WHISTLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FIGURE now stands at the top of the knoll with the flock of sheep and a YOUNG BOY. The ram trots back towards him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey looking. Mallory puts away the gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Figure is an OLD INDIAN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey crossing himself, half joking.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rejoice...for he hath found his sheep which were lost in the desert
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Chief, we ran outta gas...our car's up the road apiece.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
The Indian knows something. He says nothing, continuing down the hill and across the road with the Young Boy, the ram and about 30 sheep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey, throwing on his clothes, follows with Mallory, their dispute forgotten for now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DESERT HOGAN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MICKEY AND MALLORY approach a hogan -- a mud and log structure, twenty feet across. A PICKUP is parked nearby. A scruffy DOG alongside a PICKUP barks as they approach; a DONKEY is tied to a pinon tree and SHEEP wander.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The YOUNG BOY stands in the breeze watching them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey knocks at the open door.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi...so look we got tobacco, lots of tobacco... you got any gasoline we can buy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
No answer.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can always snatch the donkey and ride outta here.

Mallory and Mickey look at each other and step inside.

	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIAN>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOGAN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's dim inside but cozy. The old INDIAN sits on a rickety old bed with a horsehair mattress, sheep skins and an Indian blanket. A worn aluminum kitchen table occupies the middle of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bays of dried ears of corn, squash, melon and beans lay on the dirt floor. Chilies and dry mutton hang on wire strung on one side of the room. A pile of cedar wood is stacked by an old franklin stove, a covered pot on top. Scraps of cotton hang over the windows, various photos of family and friends, and feathered Indian gear hang from nails pounded into the wall. It's very quiet.
</DIRECTION>
<INDIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIAN>
<DIRECTION>
He motions for them to sit in an overstuffed chair.
</DIRECTION>
<MALLORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing to herself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm Mall-o - ry...That's Mi...ckey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALLORY>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone nods and smiles. MICKEY and MALLORY show another side of sweetness and politeness. The YOUNG KID coming in and sitting down next to the OLD MAN.
</DIRECTION>
<INDIAN>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When are you leaving?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIAN>

Mallory signals they don't understand.
</DIRECTION>
<INDIAN>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good looking woman...uh...Man's got things in his head he can't get out...demons. Too much TV...Trouble follows that one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIAN>
<MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is like the twilight zone or something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
The Old Man walks over to some pictures on the walls, hands one to Mallory of a YOUNG COUPLE back in the 1940s or 50s.

<INDIAN>

(navajo)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe they don't want to be helped. They both fly too close to sun. Now they are falling to earth. That is why they have come here. My prayers would mean nothing in their world.

He stokes the fire, feeds the snake again. He studies a crystal in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<INDIAN>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Once there was a woman who went out to collect firewood.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIAN>

The snake is crawling over to the Indian who reaches down and picks it up and puts in his lap.

<INDIAN>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to hear the story too don't you old man... O.K.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(continues)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She came upon a poisonous snake frozen in the snow. She took the snake home with her. She put the frozen snake on her favorite blanket by the warm fire. She fed it and nursed it back to health. One day she picked the snake up and it bit her on the cheek. As she lay dying she asked the snake, I loved you, why have you done this to me? The snake answered, "look bitch, you knew I was a snake."
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIAN>
<DIRECTION>
He chuckles, as does the Boy. It's very quiet. The sound of the fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey has fallen asleep. The Old Indian begins to SING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mallory is awake, watching the Indian. The room, shadows dancing. It is the first time she can remember feeling peace, almost like family. She starts to drift off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey is dreaming out loud.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Old Man stands and takes the snake to the door. Opening it, he lets the snake out.
</DIRECTION>
<INDIAN>
<DIRECTION>
(navajo)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go be a snake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey's nightmare is getting heavier. He's moaning and sweating. The Old Indian takes his feathered hat of f the wall and puts it on. He opens a wooden box and takes out a white eagle feather and a bundle of medicine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOGAN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The OLD MAN and the BOY with him now make offerings to the four directions, to the grandfather spirit, the stars, the earth, the mother, praying, singing. His face and hands are marked with white ash and colors so the spirits will recognize him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOGAN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As we hear the mounting sounds of the prayer, we see MICKEY'S face dreaming, sweating.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The OLD MAN is now leaning over Mickey and MALLORY in half light, shaking the rattle and waving the burning sage over Mickey to chase the demons.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We push into Mickey's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DREAM IMAGERY -- death, murder, shit...a WAR FOOTAGE. In Bosnia...a decapitated BODY sitting in the corner of the room, just sitting as if alive, as if about to rise up...A MAN slaps a WOMAN. A BABY cries...shooting...a MURDER VICTIM screaming "Oh god no! Please no!" BIRDS fly backwards...A MONSTER with a knife in its hand coming at us, the face of the Demon!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly TWO SHOTS explode off the walls of the hogan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey is awake, stunned, sweating -- the gun in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mallory sitting up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The OLD INDIAN stands still over Mickey. Everything stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then staring into the Beyond, he falls to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey is shocked, howls.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>

They look down at the dying Chief.
</DIRECTION>
<INDIAN>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>

	You thought coming here was an accident...this was no accident...I saw this demon in my dream - - 20 years ago. I was waiting...I forgive you.

<DIRECTION>
The Old Indian dies.
</DIRECTION>
<MALLORY>

Mickey walks outside, in circles, ranting to himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOGAN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The last of the moon is disappearing behind the earth. The lone dog howls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MICKEY with the gun in hand runs to the Indian's PICKUP truck, jumps in. It won't start. He catches a glimpse of something in the rear view mirror. The DEMON FACE over his own.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(spooked)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	SHIT!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
He leaps, scrambles out of the truck, looks in the back for gas. A 5 gallon can. He shakes it. Half full of gas.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mallory!

On the horizon, we see the YOUNG BOY standing there looking. He runs away.

MALLORY walks past MICKEY, heading elsewhere.

<MICKEY>

(catches up to her, spins her).
</DIRECTION>
<MALLORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you feel anything!...Something else has taken over Mickey. I don't know what's real anymore. I'm scared. That was bad! Maybe we were led into the wilderness by the demon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALLORY>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's no demon -- just us.

Mallory walks away.
</DIRECTION>
<MALLORY>

	I felt at peace last night. It's over Mickey! I'm going any place but with you. You got no real feelings. You're just as dead as all of 'em!

Mickey follows. A sudden rattle in the night.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a minute!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey flicks a lighter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A big RATTLESNAKE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They walk around it. She wants to get away from him, doesn't pay attention.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He flicks his lighter again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MORE SNAKES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mallory keeps walking faster and faster. Mickey tries to grab her. She breaks away.
</DIRECTION>
<MALLORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lemme alone! I'm outta here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALLORY>
<DIRECTION>
We hear another RATTLER. Mallory screams out. She's bit!
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OH GOD NO!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
He starts shooting into the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mallory lies there stunned, hands to her ears.
</DIRECTION>
<MALLORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop it...STOP IT.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALLORY>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey rips off his shirt and wraps it around a stick, soaks it in the gasoline and lights it, making a big torch in the night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There are SNAKES coming at them from all directions.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holy Shit! What the fuck have we done!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
Lighting the way with his torch, he hauls Mallory up and hotfoots it out of there, snakes popping their rattlers everywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A huge RATTLER sinks its fangs into Mickey's leg. They're both bit. He keeps moving, spitting the torch into the snake's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAR - MOVING - HIGHWAY - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Mickey driving past a ROADSIGN saying "GALLUP."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MALLORY is delirious.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll make it Mall. Badasses don't die ... Indians got a saying I read. It says you're either stronger than the poison or you die. They get bit, they run... fast as they can. They either drop dead right then and there...or they live. We're gonna live Mall -- a long, long time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>

PAST A CHEAP MOTEL on the outskirts of town -- says "U SLEEP MOTEL. $7.50 the night. Free Hot Tubs. Porno Films on Cable." The CAMERA stays with the motel, letting the car whip past.

<DIRECTION>
INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK SCAGNETTI, in undershorts on the bed, is drunk, sweating, eyeballing a friendly YOUNG WOMAN. She's awkward, a little nervous but she's down to her undergarments, looking at the CLIPPINGS of "Mickey and Mallory" spread over the table and dresser, pictures of crime scenes and his book -- "Scagnetti on Scagnetti." A half empty bottle of vodka. A gun, handcuffs and a police badge.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ya...I'm a real cop.

Pinky smiles. The light from the TV fills the room with a strange aura. The sound is off. We hear MUSIC from the next room. TRUCKS pass by outside.
</DIRECTION>
<PINKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not qonna hurt me are you?

</PINKY>
<SCAGUETTI>

	</DIALOGUE>
</SCAGUETTI>
<DIRECTION>
Not sure what he wants, Pinky steps barefoot up onto the bed, standing over him, a foot on either side of his torso...she's slowly bending, spreading, arching like a young woman remembering childhood ballet dreams, her eyes closed...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He moves his hands up her legs and ass, exploring, continuing up across her shoulders. Around her neck, bringing her down. Closer.
</DIRECTION>
<SCAGNETTI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come here, give big Jack a kiss...just keep lookin' at me now...just keep lookin'...don't close your eyes...y'ever been strangled?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCAGNETTI>
<DIRECTION>
Head LIGHTS wipe across the wall. A TRAIN passes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A different rhythm now. Her eyes. His hands around her neck. Strangling her. She is terrified, struggles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An ankle with a thin gold chain. A flailing arm kicks over the night stand and lamp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Falling, rolling. Stale green motel carpet...she heaves, staring. Slender leg kicking, fists pound at his face as he gets on top of her. Fingers tear flesh. Not a word is spoken. Her eyes never close. Fingers tear at his cheeks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The TRAIN has passed. Silence. The TV blinks. The radio plays softly in the next room (people partying, laughing).
</DIRECTION>

His face.

Mickey slams the car into drive, plowing forward out of the parking spot, smashing the movie meter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sideswipes into another car, screams, anger. A PERSON stepping out to confront.

Mickey slams his car backwards into the angry person, crushing him. Then he zigzags his way through the parking lot past the faces of Goldie and Steve.

EXT./INT. "DRUG ZONE" - NIGHT

HIGH ANGLE moving on MICKEY staggering down one aisle ... looking (presumably) for snake venom.

The same goes for MALLORY in her aisle -- face now green with the sickness, cotton-mouthed. Time is running out...her breathing labored, short -- a sound from hell.

HOME MOVIE MONTAGE -- TV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the TV -- a MONTAGE OF Home Videos. These are films of Mickey and Mallory living a normal life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- MALLORY -- very introverted -- with her PARENTS who look really weird -- doing something weird like feeding the fish. Or all three are smiling, Mallory in the middle. Her father holds a chicken drumstick. Mallory's taking a bite out of it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- MICKEY in his high school yearbook photograph or elementary school. Very innocent, sweet. Possibly a photo in Santa's lap.

	</DIALOGUE>
</WAYNE_TV>
<DIRECTION>
The Pharmacist's terrified eyes carry from the television to Mickey trying to get his attention out the booth. Up close Mickey looks like shit, pale, sweating, waving a handful of rubbers at the Druggist. His mouth voicing words through the ventilated "bullet-proof" glass:
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey you... 'scuse me? Aloha?

</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
The Pharmacist in zombied terror approaches.

	</DIALOGUE>

The Pharmacist nods and silently pushes the ELECTRONIC ALARM beneath the counter with his fat finger. In a daze of his own, he complies with Mickey's request, meandering to the medicine shelves.

FLYING POV CAMERA -- ripping down the aisle, Mickey's POV -- there's a honk from outside.

Mickey tearing past vitamin displays, knocking down a rack of stuffed animals. His strength is fading. Snake juice coursing through his veins.

FLASH -- THE DEAD INDIAN

FLASH -- THE SUN. BUDDHA...some sign of spiritual hope.

He gets to the door, swings out through the glass. Sees it:

EXT. PHARMACY AND PARKING LOT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mallory is slugging it out toe to toe with a COP. Another COP lies on the ground at her feet, dead. TWO COP CARS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THREE MORE COPS in windbreakers are tearing up - simultaneously spot MICKEY in the doorway. They hit the pavement pulling their guns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey is faster. Whipping down, his .45 out, blazing away...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tearing a hole through one COP...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Taking out ANOTHER with a headwound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bullets CRASHING through the pharmacy glass, shattering the frontage of the store.

<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. PHARMACY - NIGHT

MICKEY scrambling back into the aisle, protected. Looks back and sees:

	Throw your gun down! And get on the floor! Now!

</COP>
<DIRECTION>
AN EXIT PATH -- out the rear of the store.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But back to MALLORY as she is engulfed by TWO MORE COPS, altogether beating the shit out of her with guns, fists, nightsticks, and dragging her behind one of their cars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The look on Mickey's face. Heartbroken. He's gotta stay. He's gotta go down with her.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Awright! Awright! I'm coming!! But don't fucking touch her! You hear me or you got a few more dead pigs on your hands!

(standing, arms in the air, full exposure)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So...come'n get the big bad wolf.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
SCAGNETTI suddenly appears from behind one of the cars -- nice suit, a gun in his hand, the "look." Even down to the fingernail scars on his cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LIGHT pops on. A LOCAL NEWSCREW filming as:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Three more COP CARS arrive. POLICE are pouring in.
</DIRECTION>
<SCAGNETTI>
<DIRECTION>
(on bull horn)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put your hands where I can see them. Step out into the light and lay down on the ground. Now...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCAGNETTI>
<DIRECTION>
With Scagnetti in the lead, the video camera tracks behind the THREE COPS in windbreakers crashing towards Mickey, guns drawn, overdoing it a bit for camera in a "COPS" TV docudrama style. A "recreation" already of an event that is just traspiring.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey has a smile on his face as Scagnetti hauls him around and cranks up his arms behind his back, trying to cuff him.
</DIRECTION>
<SCAGNETTI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're outta business Knox you fuckhead! You're gonna die, you piece of shit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCAGNETTI>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey, never out of surprises, joker smile and all, wrenches one hand free. He whips out his BUCK KNIFE and swings it behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He hits COP 1 in the eyes. COP 1 screams and falls on the ground. Blood smears his face and hands.
</DIRECTION>
<COP_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My eyes! My fuckin' eyes are out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP_1>
<DIRECTION>
Scagnetti has jumped back, alarmed.
</DIRECTION>
<SCAGNETTI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't kill him! I wanna fuck him! He's mine!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCAGNETTI>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey stands there, knife in hand, toying with them. As he drops the knife:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The TWO OTHER cops pull out their TASER GUNS and fire lots of volts into Mickey's torso. It's an extraordinary sight!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CU on Mickey on fire, electrified, spinning, spinning...till he sees stars, millions of stars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA WHIRLING with Mickey as he crashes to earth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unsatisfied, the Cops pull out their clubs and beat him mercilessly -- with all the pent-up righteous rage of so many good men killed in the line of duty against this raging psychopath asshole. Galaxy bandit. Forever outlaw to the race of man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The NEWS CREW films. In the wake of Rodney King, the Cops don't really pay attention.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mallory, bloodied to her pulp, watches from the ground, on her knees, arms squeeze-cuffed behind her, a nightstick through her elbows. She SINGS to herself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scagnetti crosses to her, jerks her up by the hair, examines her as coldly as a bug.
</DIRECTION>
<MALLORY>

EXT. BATONGA PRISON - DAY

SUBTITLE: "A YEAR LATER"

<DIRECTION>
TWO MEN move toward us -- SCAGNETTI and a Deputy Warden, WURLITZER, in uniform.
</DIRECTION>
<WURLITZER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...always wanted to meet you Scagnetti. I respect you and you know what, I even bought your book and I read the whole goddamn thing!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WURLITZER>
<DIRECTION>
As they walk past us, revealing the medieval-looking prison in background, they come to a standing tower of a man, Warden DWIGHT McCLUSKY -- suit and tie, a man of iron from another era -- with another Deputy Warden, KAVANAUGH, in uniform.

</MCCLUSKY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PRISON CORRIDORS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A door slams, giant reverb down the halls. Echoes of keys clinking, eyes of GUARDS. McClusky waves his arms as he moves and gates slide.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they move, we sense a tense prison -- the nervous demeanors and eyes of GUARDS, silent scary PRISONERS in close proximity. The TWO DEPUTIES, Wurlitzer and Kavanaugh, tag along, wary protection, despising the inmates, ADLIBBING to their many requests.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCLUSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I seen you on TV. I even went and read your goddamn book. I'm impressed. That E. Scarwin case was something. You put an end to a nightmare, Scagnetti...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCLUSKY>
<SCAGNETTI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was no big deal, Warden, just business as usual.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCAGNETTI>
<MCCLUSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm surprised Hollywood ain't found you yet. Your story would make a better movie than that "Serpico" shit. But I tell ya Scagnetti, in all my years in the penal business -- and I tell ya that's no small number Mickey and Mallory Knox are without doubt the most twisted, depraved group of shitfucks it's ever been my displeasure to lay my eyes on. I mean, these two rat fucks are a walkin' reminder of just how fucked up our system really is.

	Psychiatrist?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCAGNETTI>

	Yeah. My old man beat the tar out of me -- but I didn't kill him.

</MCCLUSKY>
<DIRECTION>
They laugh together as they go past a new door. A nervous GUARD whispers to Deputy Wurlitzer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly FOUR GUARDS come out of a cell, carrying a badly bloodied PRISONER. He's been stabbed over and over. They hustle him past McClusky and Scagnetti who keep talking, ignoring the filthy looks thrown at McClusky from every PRISONER in the cell block.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCLUSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...so how does a guy like you become a specialist in psychos?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCLUSKY>
<SCAGNETTI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Dwight, for starters I'd recommend having your mother killed by one. After that happened, I developed a rather keen interest in the subject.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCAGNETTI>
<MCCLUSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCLUSKY>

<SCAGNETTI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I meant y'know, the assholes I grew up with who beat the shit outta me...Anyway, one day when I was five, my mother took me out to play in the park. Well, that just so happened to be the same day that Charles Whitman climbed up to the top of University of Texas tower and started shooting strangers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCAGNETTI>
<MCCLUSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You was with her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCLUSKY>
<SCAGNETTI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure was. You see, the thing is I didn't hear the shots. I didn't hear any of 'em. One minute I'm walking with my mother and then all of a sudden her chest explodes. She hits the ground, right? I'm just lookin' at her. Her forearm flies off. Then her hip explodes. Now, I'm not hearing any of these shots. All I know is my mother is falling apart in front of my eyes...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCAGNETTI>
<MCCLUSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about you, son?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCLUSKY>
<SCAGNETTI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some hero grabbed me and threw me behind a bush. It took them all goddamn day to get Charlie. So, that meant I spent all Goddamn day lyin' flat on the grass, being eaten alive by fuckin' ants and thinkin' "What the fuck happened to my mom?" Ever since I've had a strong opinion about the psychopathic fringe that thrives today in America's fast food culture. I tend not to exhibit self-discipline becoming of a peace officer.

<SCAGNETTI>
<DIRECTION>
(ignores the question)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not at all. But I tell you what it is. These fucks think they're special -- Daddy yanked their dicks, Momma never game 'em a hug -- so they have carte blanche to take innocent life.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(McClusky nods intensely)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They think they're invincible. I never caught a killer yet who ever dreamed he might get caught. And they all look the same when I catch 'em -- like little kids with their hands in the cookie jar.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCAGNETTI>
<MCCLUSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's my observation as well. We have an army of shrinks who talk about mania and schizophrenia and multiphrenia and obsessions. But it's all bullshit. It's Pride! Arrogance! Somewhere, somehow they get the idea they're better than everyone else -- it makes me sick. And Mickey and Mallory Knox are the sickest I've ever seen.

The gate slides open. MICKEY KNOX is led in by TWO DEPUTIES, wearing a blue jumpsuit with a thick and wide leather belt around the waist and metal rings built into each side. Long sturdy chains with handcuffs on each end are wrapped across his body and through the rings, binding his arms to his sides. His hands and feet are double-cuffed.
</DIRECTION>

The DEPUTIES have their guns drawn, ready to blow Mickey in half at the slightest provocation. Yet for a man wrapped and bound in. chains, Mickey seems strangely in control of his environment.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I feel it's apparent to anyone who's hip to what's going on that the Prison Board has thrown the Constitution straight out the fuckin' window. You and Mallory may be killers but nuts, insane? NOT. You're being railroadedinto a hospital for the sole purpose of turning you into a vegetable. Now some people are saying, "So what." I am not one of those people. If we avert our eyes while they do this to you, we give them permission to do it again whenever they see fit. Today, they wipe clean your mind because they feel your actions are dangerous, tomorrow they wipe clean my mind -- or dump me in syndication -- because they feel what I say is dangerous. Where does it all end? That's my angle.

	My problem Mickey, is you don't exactly inspire empathy. I'm all alone on this. I need your help. I have interviews with the Prison Board, with Warden Dwight McClusky -- and I'm telling ya Mickey, they look bad. The two psychologists they used for their kangaroo court won't talk to us -- which also looks bad. I have an interview with the judge at your trial Bert Steinsma, and the psychologist and famous author Emil Reignold -- both of which discount the notion you're insane. What we need now is YOU. You haven't talked to the press since your trial. Now a few days before you get transferred to an asylum, you give an exclusive to Wayne Gale. We're talking a media event here. A 40/50 share. We run this during the Sweeps, the network'll be creaming for it, promos on the Super Bowl --

Mickey is running his ass off, straight into the twisting devil...obviously a PROCESS SHOT is looming here.

He takes the WARDEN aside; Scagnetti dropping back.

<WAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well...small world. Well then you know how it works. What we're about in this talk business is intimacy, Dwight. We're about two people having a conversation. I want a trust to develop. If you're thinking about all this...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(indicating the bustle of the room)
</DIRECTION>

(pauses, Dwight waits; Wayne switches gears)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which brings me to ... what I wanted to talk to you about...I have to get Mickey Knox to relax-- to share what he's never shared before. How Dwight can we expect him to do that when we got more deputies per cubic inch looking up his asshole with shotguns than he has photosynthetic spores?

	Two--I'm a journalist, and I'm prepared to take that risk. Grenada, Panama; I was dodging 'scuds in Baghdad, Dwight. Three--it ain't gonna happen. Believe me when I tell you, it's in Mickey Knox's best interest to play this game according to Hoyle.

(counting the DEPUTIES in the room)

	Six...seven.. eight. Jesus Christ Duane, they hate him. He hates them. We got hate in the air. Even you and I feel it. I gotta explore Mickey. Columbus didn't know he was looking for America. He was looking for India. He needed to be left alone, trusted, he...

CAMERA now in the room, rolling off Wayne to reveal Mickey and the setup. It's made to look like a one on one but we now see McClusky's DEPUTIES, among them WURLITZER and KAVANAUGH, are quite close, just out of camera range. Mickey is cool as a feather.

<WAYNE>

INT. MALLORY CORRIDOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The silence is vast...As SCAGNETTI'S feet go past, drawn inexorably to her cell. TWO GUARDS accompany him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MALLORY CELL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DOORS open -- SCAGNETTI'S POV marching in.
</DIRECTION>
<SCAGNETTI>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rise and shine Mallory!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCAGNETTI>
<DIRECTION>
MALLORY, asleep on the bunk, springs into a fighting stance. If you've seen a panther in a zoo, you understand the attitude Mallory brings with her everywhere she goes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA whips back to Scagnetti and the TWO GUARDS -- with shotguns trained on her.
</DIRECTION>
<GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Turn around and face the wall!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD>
<SCAGNETTI>
<DIRECTION>
(approaching her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's all right fellows, we want to have a little talk is all...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCAGNETTI>
<DIRECTION>
Pulls a chair out, indicates for her to sit. She doesn't.
</DIRECTION>
<GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
(nervous)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Scagnetti, don't get close to her. She'll kill you!...One way or the other, she'll kill ya!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
Scagnetti ushers them to the door.
</DIRECTION>
<SCAGNETTI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Relax fellows, read my book. Now I met some women were really crocodiles in my time but this little lady--I think she's gotta sweet streak for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCAGNETTI>
<DIRECTION>
Scagnetti pulls his gun out and gives it to the Guard, pushing the door closed on him.
</DIRECTION>
<GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, we're not allowed...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
Scagnetti closes the door on them. Alone with Mallory.
</DIRECTION>
<SCAGNETTI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Smoke?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she stares)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know you smoke.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCAGNETTI>
<DIRECTION>
A look of steel. He gets closer, gentle.
</DIRECTION>
<SCAGNETTI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know I'm not here to hurt you, Mallory. I wanna be your friend. And if I ever met a girl who needs a friend, it's you. You're a very pretty girl...but I'm sure people tell you that all the time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCAGNETTI>
<DIRECTION>
Mallory doesn't respond. Scagnetti takes the cigarette from his mouth, puts it between Mallory's lips. She smokes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scagnetti relaxes. Step one. Hold on a C.U. of Mallory.
</DIRECTION>
<SCAGNETTI>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was reading the file on you. You know what it said? It said during your trial, whenever they put you on the stand, no matter what they asked, your answer was always the same... "I love Mickey." It also says that when they gave you a polygraph "I love Mickey" was the only thing you said that registered as the truth ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCAGNETTI>
<DIRECTION>
Scagnetti appears at the side of frame next to Mallory.
</DIRECTION>
<SCAGNETTI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who are you supposed to be? Squeaky Fromme? Is Mickey your Charles Manson? Or does he just got a big dick? That's it, isn't it? Mickey's got a big donkey dick. But you ain't seen mine. You never been fucked by the real Prince Charming.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCAGNETTI>
<DIRECTION>
Scagnetti changes to Mallory's other ear. He's playing with a cobra here, and he knows it. It turns him on, deeper into his sexual obsession with murder.
</DIRECTION>
<SCAGNETTI>
<DIRECTION>
(pressing close)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you remember the last time you fucked? Huh? What I want you to do is close your eyes and remember...remember the last time ol' Mickey gave you the high hard one. Are ya thinking about it? Good. Remember it. Don't ever forget it cause it ain't never gonna happen again. Cause when they get through with all that electroshock shit they got lined up for you two, Mick's dick ain't gonna be worth shit. Course you're not gonna give a particular shit either. Cause when the good doctors get through givin' you the zap...you won't know where the hell you are. They'll just put you on a window sill and water you every other day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCAGNETTI>
<DIRECTION>
Mallory looks at him with steel, then yawns. Drops the cigarette on the floor
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CU of cigarette hitting the floor in SLOW MOTION. We can still see the red, burning end.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CU of Mallory's bare foot rising off the floor in SLOW MOTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CU at floor level of Mallory's foot coming down on top of the cigarette, then grinding it out -- SLOW MOTION.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scagnetti watches this, gulps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RECREATION ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Where the television was first smashed; the tone has shifted from insurrection to riot Instead of subduing the PRISONERS, the SEVEN GUARDS are now in full retreat, swinging nightsticks over shield. The Prisoners, all desperate angry men, attack them -- bring them down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>

The RIOT is spreading. The MEN take one of the GUARDS and throw him into a huge spinning WASHING MACHINE and slam the door on him, watching him go round and round.

The interview winds down. JULIE very pleased -- a big "thumbs up" for WAYNE who gleams. Dollar signs all over his brain.
</DIRECTION>
<WAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>

<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's indescribable.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Then was it really worth it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAYNE>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was what worth it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<WAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was massacring all those people worth being separated from your wife for the rest of your life?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAYNE>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you think up all these question or does it come from some central casting for reporters?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<WAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No Mickey, I can't let you get away with rhetoric. Answer the question. Was it worth it? You haven't seen, heard, or smelled Mallory in a year? Was it worth it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAYNE>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was an instant of purity worth a lifetime lie? Yeah, it was.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<WAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me, did you say an 'instant of purity'? What was that instant of purity? The bodies you left behind?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAYNE>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's only part of it. I mean, its a big, big part. But it's only the chorus, it's not the whole song.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<WAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
(passionately)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please explain to me, Mickey, where's the "purity" that you couldn't live without in 48 people who are no longer on this planet because they met you and Mallory? What's so fucking

ECU profile of DEPUTY WURLITZER on the intercom, hearing the news of the riot for the first time. His expression shows. He signals to MCCLUSKY who goes to the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(meanwhile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll never understand. Me and you, Wayne, we're not even the same species. I used to be you...then I evolved. From where you're standing, you're a man. From where I'm standing, you're an ape...I'm here...I'm still evolving...and you, you're stuck somewhere else man. You're presenting a reflection of yourself. You buy and sell the Fear. You say why? I say why not?

</MICKEY>
<WAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
(with Mike Wallace intensity)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

<MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...so the mother says to the sister 'Okay, you can go to the drive-in movie with Bobby as long as you take Little Johnny.' The sister says okay. They go to the drive-in, they come back. The Mother gets Little Johnny and says, 'Okay, what happened? Where did ya go?' Johnny who can't talk, goes...

</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey, as Little Johnny, draws a square in the air, and acts like he's driving.

<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mother says, 'The drive-in movie. What did they do?'
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>

<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'They kissed. What else?'
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey, as Little Johnny, squeezes imaginary breasts. The guards relax, listening. It gets their minds off the outside riot.

</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
Everybody in the room breaks up. As Mickey finishes the punchline he steps in front of KAVANAUGH, laughing, and SLAMS his elbow in his face. Kavanaugh staggers. Mickey grabs his shotgun, rips it from his grasp, then bashes him in the face, swivelling to confront:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The THREE other GUARDS reacting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey SHOOTS DEPUTY 1 in the chest, blowing him off his feet. He flies across the room and lands in a thudding heap.

As Wayne reaches for his cellular phone, Mickey notices something in the back of his belt, under his loosened and frayed shirt. Mickey reaches for it.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell is this Wayne!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
It's a 40 calibre Glock semi-automatic. States of the art. But Wayne will not give it up so easy. Quick as a wink, Wayne goes for Mickey's wrist -- tries to put him into an aikido sweep-down move -- accompanied by a fierce SHOUT.
</DIRECTION>
<WAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eeeeeeyaaahhhhhh!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing happens. Mickey just stands there, grins -- then smashes Wayne in the face with a straight arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wayne hits the floor, in GROANING pain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey brandishes Wayne's gun.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>

</SCAGNETTI>
<DIRECTION>
MALLORY smiles and suddenly starts to dance. Spreading her arms, undulating her belly. She's a natural born dancer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCAGNETTI watches her, fascinated, misunderstanding. He peels off his shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<SCAGNETTI>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah?...what do you think about...right now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALLORY>
<DIRECTION>
Mallory is weaving like a cobra around him, getting close but never touching him, making him sweat. Pulling his pants down half way, he takes her seat.
</DIRECTION>
<MALLORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me what you want...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALLORY>
<DIRECTION>
Scagnetti is screaming with lust and murder. His head revolving 360 degrees around the back of the chair to watch her. He can't help himself. He's not thinking straight. He's lost it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She gets in his face, very close. About to kiss him first with her belly, then with her lips.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We even think she might be going along with him. He's moving his lips closer to hers. She smiles -- that long slow orgasm of a smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then she nails him. Smashing into his face with a headbutt. Breaking his nose in an explosion of blood and pain. Scagnetti lets out a horrible SCREAM. She tears into him.

The TWO GUARDS burst through the door to find SCAGNETTI face down on the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MALLORY'S standing, her foot pressed against the middle of Scagnetti's back, pulling his arms behind him trying to break his back. His body is bending like a branch, and he's screaming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The TWO GUARDS are on top of her like tornadoes, beating the shit out of her with their shotguns.
</DIRECTION>

She slugs it out with them. Is Scagnetti alive... Barely crawling on the floor, a crumpled wormlike moan escapes his lips.

VIDEO FOOTAGE of WAYNE caught in MICKEY'S HOSTAGE TRAIN ~- is all handheld and harshly lit. Wayne's crouched, moving backwards, trying to reassert control over the situation as well as his own terror. The relationship he has to his mike and the camera certainly helps.

The CAMERA swings wildly on ROGER's shoulder to catch MICKEY edging up to the exterior of MALLORY'S CELL -- about to break in. CONVICTS screaming continue to run by CAMERA without direction occasionally flitting to a stop to stare or to make a face in the camera, chased off by Mickey's gun.

Right next to Mickey, TECHNICIAN 4 (we will work backwards as they are eliminated) takes a hit in the gut. Mickey spins to confront:

The CAMERA dollying down to the "Scag" crouched over Mallory, his gun pointed right at Mickey about to fire.

Squatting, Mickey has the shotgun trained on Scagnetti.

They're positioned across from each other on opposite sides of the room.

Scagnetti is in pig heaven as MALLORY, reddened with mace, looms up behind him with a prison fork clasped in her hand. She yanks Scagnetti back by the neck and drives the fork deep into his throat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ECU the back part of his head. We hear the sickening sound of the fork plunging into his throat. His head jerks back violently, farther into frame, still held by Mallory
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ECU of Scagnetti as his face is racked with pain. He gurgles, eyes bulging.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She lets him go, stands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wayne and his TV audience unbelieving.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks down at him. Raises her foot and pitches him over onto the floor, trembling, still alive. He tries -- through the remainder of the scene -- to get back up on his knees, the CAMERA trembling from his POV on:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mallory running into Mickey's arms, passionately kissing. This kiss has been a year coming. Now they're doing something everybody told them they would never do again.
</DIRECTION>
<WAYNE>

ROGER'S VIDEO captures it all. The FOOTAGE we see through his camera is very similar to Vietnam footage. It's shaky, real harsh, and it captures the pandemonium of battle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The soundtrack is a mad mixture of yelling, crying, laughing and gunfire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MORE DEPUTIES appear, tracking them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wild CARAVAN runs in the other direction, FIRING behind them. TECHNICIAN 1 goes down and Mickey's HIT in the leg, but keeps on running and FIRING. Mallory sees this and screams.

MORE DEPUTIES appear at the other end of the HALLWAY, catching Mickey and his crew in a treacherous CROSSFIRE.

Mickey and Mallory get back to back with each other, using their SHIELDS firing from the rear and the front.

Wayne's hit in the ass and ear. Anger in his face. ("Fuck! Fuck!")
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Julie is killed, geysering blood all over Mickey and Mallory.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roger's camera WHIP PANS from that to catch a DEPUTY hopping around the corner. The SCREEN FLASHES WHITE with a BLAST.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roger's HIT, and the VIDEO CAMERA goes haywire, reeling out of control, then THUNKING to the ground. Roger screams O.S.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA lies on the floor, video still recording. Roger rolls into FRAME screaming.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get the camera! Get the fucking camera!

Wayne, angry beyond his character, reaches down inside himself and grabs the gun off a dead Deputy -- and fires a blast at an oncoming DEPUTY who drops. He fires at another, and another!

Mickey firing cover for her, sees Wayne has gone nuts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kavanaugh is hit again, looks like he's dying. It looks bad for the hometeam, but suddenly:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OWEN is there. A mild looking man in convict's uniform, calm, emotionless, with his thinning hair he could pass for an accountant. In one arm is a 12-gauge. On his other arm is a gas grenade launcher.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's blasting down the approaching DEPUTIES, letting gas grenades blur the corridor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Deputies scatter.

<DIRECTION>
Through the smoke, Owen looks down at Mickey.
</DIRECTION>
<OWEN>
	<DIALOGUE>

The Knox's jump up and holding Duncan and propping Kavanaugh, with Wayne tailing, they run down a NEW CORRIDOR that Owen leads them to.

Deputies are lying on the ground, wounded and screaming, or dead and silent.

Across from them a PHALANX of GUNS and LAWMEN -- moving in syncopated unison, a parallel track out the STAIRWELL into the FINAL CORRIDOR approaching the RECEPTION AREA to the prison. Freedom!

Wayne keeps yelling, Duncan blubbering; the Deputies keep their guns trained but they give ground -- parting like the Red Sea.

The Warden, bucking with pain, looks up the Corridor where Mickey and Mallory have just come from. What he sees is his worst nightmare.

<DIRECTION>
Coming right at him are a HUNDRED ANGRY PRISONERS, shotguns, sticks, numbchuks, razors, broken chairs waving, climbing over the corpses of their fallen comrades, withstanding the hail of fire from the Guards -- reaching for Dwight McClusky who is lifted over their heads, having his heart attack, moved from hand to hand like at a rock concert, then all we see are the tops of his shoes as he is held upside down and torn to pieces.

	I mean it's not like we care...If they wanna say we masterminded the whole thing, let 'em. It won't exactly keep us up at night, Wayne. But the truth is...it was fate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALLORY>
<WAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and Fate it was!...and this is "American Maniacs."

Mickey's snapping his fingers in the B.G.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, c'mon, let's hurry this up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<WAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, what's next?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAYNE>
<MALLORY>
<DIRECTION>
(holding Mickey's hand)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, now me and Mickey are gonna take it easy. Just enjoy each other's company...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALLORY>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gotta go...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<WAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait! But how do you intend to disappear? You're probably the most famous couple in America.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAYNE>
<MALLORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, back in slave times they had a thing called the underground railroad. And we got a whole fan club out there just waitin' to be conductors
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to the camera)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, you kids out there, keep the faith. Cause Mickey and Mallory will be comin' to your town real soon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALLORY>
<WAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAYNE>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, end of interview.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey approaches Wayne. CAMERA goes a little haywire as Wayne lowers it.
</DIRECTION>
<WAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, just let me swing around and film myself asking the questions. And then I'll do my little wrap up and we're off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey takes the CAMERA from Wayne, and while he speaks, he balances it on a fence post.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, we're gonna do a little wrap up, all right Wayne. But it won't be you starin' in the camera, lookin' dumb, and actin' stupid. Instead, you're gonna be starin' down the barrels of our shotguns and we're gonna be pullin' the triggers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
Wayne forces a chuckle. Mickey steps away from the CAMERA and into a THREESHOT. Actually a FOUR SHOT with Owen there at first, but again he slides out. The NEWS VAN is parked in the EG.
</DIRECTION>
<WAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a joke right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey pumps the slide on his shotgun. Mallory grabs her shot gun from off the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<WAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just wait one fucking minute.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAYNE>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said I'd give you an interview. Now unless I'm mistaken, we just did an interview
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Mallory)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We did an interview, didn't we?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<MALLORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looked like an interview to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALLORY>
<WAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
(sincere)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait! I don't know, but I kinda felt during this ...this whole escape that a kind of bond --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Wayne is shaking)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...developed between the three of us. We're kinda in this together, don't ya think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAYNE>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Not really. You're scum Wayne. You did it for ratings. You poured gasoline on the fire. You didn't give a shit about us or about anything Wayne except yourself. That's why nobody really gives a shit about you Wayne. That's why they didn't deploy helicoptors!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<WAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mickey! What about the Indian?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAYNE>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<WAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't you say you were finished with killin'? "Love beats the demon?"
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAYNE>
<MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(sharing a look with Mallory)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am. And it will...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's just that you're the last one, Wayne. You gonna feed on your own misery.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<WAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
(new tone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So big fuckin' deal, that's show business. Who cares, so I'm a parasite....it's a "cruel world" out there. You were wronged. So what else is new? The day you killed, your ass belonged to us. You did what you had to do. So did I. We're married.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Mallory laughing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Think about it. The point is we can do a Salmon Rushdie thing next, books, talk shows, all remote, we move around, duckin' and bobbin', then we come up for air once in a while. Donahue, Oprah, Playboy...the mystery avengers, do you know how big you could be?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAYNE>
<MALLORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does he have an "off" button? Can we take out his batteries?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALLORY>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We got a better idea. How bout we kill you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<WAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
(incensed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus Christ! What are you nitwits? You can't kill me! Without television you're nothing, nothing...two kids, I made you Mickey, you owe me. Without me you're on the bus to fuckin' diznee land.

</MICKEY>
<WAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait! Wait! Don't Mickey and Mallory always leave somebody alive to tell the tale??
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAYNE>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We are.

	<DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	NO!!!! You can't shoot me. I AM WAYNE GALE. My lawyers...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey and Mallory PUMP rounds into Wayne, whose body dances like a puppet before collapsing to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey and Mallory kiss each other passionately.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey slips a new WEDDING BAND on her finger -- and one for himself. Mallory is really happy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They climb into the News Van. They drive away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wayne's body lies peacefully in FRAME as the CAMERA rolls out of film.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE IN:

INT. "AMERICAN MANIACS" NEWSVAN - DAY

<DIRECTION>
MICKEY drives. MALLORY rides shotgun. The CAMERA moves and reveals OWEN in back. Mallory strums Mickey's guitar.
</DIRECTION>
<OWEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I liked Wayne.

</OWEN>
<MICKEY>

</OWEN>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not bad for a first timer
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<MALLORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got a real mean streak in ya, Owen. That'll get you where you wanna go.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about you folks? You think you'll be able to lie low?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Mexico? Never been...

</OWEN>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you ain't goin' either, Owen. We promised you a ride out, that's it. We're droppin' you next town.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<OWEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you promised you'd take me with you!

</MICKEY>
<OWEN>

(very disappointed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too bad...I'll tell you what I'd really like, though.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OWEN>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<OWEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd really like a taste of old Mallory over there. I never got with the wild kind before.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OWEN>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey turns his head to see if Owen's joking.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't talk like that, Owen. Mean streak or not, I don't wanna hear that kinda talk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<OWEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm serious though. I'd love to take her for a test drive. What do you say, Mallory? Are you interested?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OWEN>
<DIRECTION>
Mallory turns around with her gun loosely pointed at Owen.
</DIRECTION>
<MALLORY>
<DIRECTION>
(mocking singsong)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh god -- can you feel my breasts? Can you spread my ass? How's your pussy looking? Is this for real? I swear I'd love to contain myself but people like you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALLORY>
<DIRECTION>
Owen pulls his own gun up.
</DIRECTION>
<OWEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, there's no reason to talk angry, Mallory. You'll make me think you don't desire me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OWEN>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right! That's enough bullshit! I don't like the fact you induced my wife to talk this way...Put the guns down and can it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
Mallory puts her gun down. Owen doesn't.
</DIRECTION>
<OWEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you do everything he tells you?

	Is that what's standing between you and me? Mickey telling you what to do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OWEN>
<MALLORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You better pull over and dump this prick before I really get mad, Mickey
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALLORY>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey pulls to a severe stop, turns.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right Owen...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
He is staring down the barrel of Owen's gun. Owen has a crazy grin on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SPECIAL EFFECT: Owen now has the face of the DEMON!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey understands. He laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Owen pulls the trigger, a BLAST fills the screen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mallory turns in STOP MOTION, looking at Owen with vengeance in her eyes. She SCREAMS at what she sees. ANOTHER BLAST fills the screen.
