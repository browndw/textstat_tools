Shit.

ZAVITZ backs from the window, seized by panic. He grabs his phone...

He picks up his fax line. Also dead.

ZAVITZ inches along, scared breathless. He looks back.

No one.

Maybe he was wrong.

<DIRECTION>
A pigeon suddenly flies by...ZAVITZ loses his balance, struggles...and falls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He crashes through an awning and into a sidewalk fruit stand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dazed, ZAVITZ crawls to his feet as passersby watch speechless.
</DIRECTION>

Things happen fast. The cargo van rips from the curb but is suddenly blocked by a delivery truck. HORNS BLAST.

HICKS, 30's and athletic, leaps from the van.

Fears confirmed, ZAVITZ starts down the sidewalk, shakes off pain, and moves to a run.

ZAVITZ struggles and climbs. Reaching a landing, he pauses for breath...

A SKINNY MAN clutches the folder, walking by endless cubicles of high-tech industriousness. He stops where an ANALYST types on a terminal near a retinal scanner. The ANALYST opens the folder to see a request for a PRIORITY WRAP on ROBERT DEAN, followed by a Social Security Number. The ANALYST enters in the number.

Months, years flashing by quickly. Other data banks are probed. Insurance policies, credit histories, video rentals, library checkouts, school transcripts, ATM transactions, tax returns...everything. Irregularities are red-flagged.

A matching ZAVITZ ITEM is found. DEAN's banking info is red-flagged. He has large cash withdrawals with no matching purchases. His withdrawal dates match up with unaccounted-for cash deposits...

She enters a phone number in her terminal. The computer DIALS. She waits, snacking on rice cakes. Finally, another computer ANSWERS. On screen appears: PAC-TEL TESTING BOARD. The screen fills with choices. She highlights -

Beneath a sign reading U.S. North-East Coastal Region, an ANALYST reviews time-coded, digital SAT videos of Washington, D.C. As seen from space, the Capitol appears to be nothing more than a greyish mass. The ANALYST keys commands into his system.

	This is 209! Does anyone copy?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRILL>
<DIRECTION>
Then "BRILL" sees that the alley empties into a busy street, then a bakery shop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He slams the brakes. Tires screech smoke but it's no use. The powerful Chevy pushes the cab, bumper to bumper, toward the street. "BRILL" grips the wheel. It's all he can do as the cab rockets into cross traffic and--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLAM! They're broad-sided by a delivery truck. The cab is shoved sideways along the street and into a fire- hydrant, finally stopping under jetting water from the broken main.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DEAN slowly opens his eyes. Water pours in everywhere. "BRILL" is sticking halfway through a window, not moving. Seeing "BRILL"'s pistol, DEAN grabs it and crawls from the wreckage.

They back away as DEAN gets to his feet and looks around. Off to the side he sees the Chevy, waiting like a coiled snake.

DEAN limps into the crowd. He rounds the corner to ANOTHER STREET and now he's running with all he's got left.

A helicopter hovers near the Washington Monument. BRILL eyes it cautiously.

BRILL turns to leave--

DEAN continues blocking the door, maintaining calm even as BRILL's pistol is pressed firmly to his forehead.
</DIRECTION>
<DEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got a hundred-thousand dollars in jewelry in a safe-deposit box under a third party name.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And take this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRILL>
<DIRECTION>
And with that, he's gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DEAN eyes the gun. He walks to the ledge, looking at the city.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DEAN'S POV: Several vehicles quietly pull up to the building. MEN storm out an move inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DEAN quickly backs away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUILDING CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DEAN races for the stairwell two steps at a time. He hears the SOUND of a DOOR OPENING somewhere below.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	303 to 301. Floor one secured. Moving to two.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
DEAN retreats upward, then he hears SOMEONE COMING DOWN. Trapped. He opens the door on '3' and is about to run when he sees a security camera directly above.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grabbing a fire extinguisher, he pulls the pin. Spray coats the lens. Then he yanks a FIRE ALARM. A HORN BLARES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DEAN runs for the second stairwell when he sees JONES stepping out. DEAN looks back at the stairwell he left. That door's opening as well.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trapped.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Using the extinguisher, DEAN smashes the glass door to an office and goes inside. JONES starts to enter when a shot rips into the wall, convincing him otherwise. He retreats as the BLARING FIRE ALARM STOPS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DEAN races through the suite of offices trying locked door after locked door. Finally, one opens and he rushes in and tries to lock it behind himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No lock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sees the MEN and they see him. He slides a desk against the door, then backs away, pistol ready.
</DIRECTION>
<JONES>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) (disturbingly calm)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Open the door, Mr. Dean. There's nowhere to go. We'd just like to talk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONES>
<DIRECTION>
Seeing a phone, DEAN grabs it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No tone. Just a RECORDING of Nancy Sinatra's song "These Boots are Made for Walking".
</DIRECTION>
<JONES>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It'd be easier for all of us if you just come out. Nothing'll happen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONES>
<DIRECTION>
DEAN heaves a coffee table up on the desk.
</DIRECTION>
<JONES>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's quite hopeless what you're doing, Mr. Dean.

</JONES>
<DEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I swear to God I'll shoot.

</DEAN>
<JONES>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) (chuckling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you might be over-reacting there, Mr. Dean. We just want to talk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONES>
<DEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go ahead. I hear you fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEAN>
<DIRECTION>
The door pushes in--
</DIRECTION>
<DEAN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said I'll shoot!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEAN>
<DIRECTION>
The door keeps pushing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DEAN FIRES high.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pushing stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then DEAN hears the distant sound of SIRENS approaching. DEAN rips off his sweater, takes out a lighter, and sets the sweater on fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He throws it into a garbage can and tosses styrofoam cups in on top of it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pushing starts again, but before DEAN can fire, a small cylindrical device drops into the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A STUN GRENADE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DEAN ducks as a BLINDING FLASH rocks the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The window is blown open. Smoke billows out. DEAN, temporarily blinded and deaf, struggles to a ledge as fire engines arrive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VAN - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fire trucks, police cars and an ambulance arrive beneath DEAN as HICKS watches from his van.

</HICKS>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AMBULANCE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DEAN sits in back with a PARA-MEDIC, covered in soot, breathing hard through an oxygen mask as the ambulance WAILS and weaves through traffic. He looks through the rear window to see--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO CARS FOLLOWING, keeping pace. Off to the side, RFK Stadium is emptying, a Redskins game is over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DEAN rips off the oxygen mask--
</DIRECTION>
<DEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell him to stop the ambulance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEAN>
<PARAMEDIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa there, fella. Just take it easy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARAMEDIC>
<DEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell him to stop the ambulance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEAN>
<PARAMEDIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now you're a little shaken up, but we're gonna get you on your feet in--
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARAMEDIC>
<DIRECTION>
DEAN whips out his pistol and shoves it in the PARAMEDIC's face--
</DIRECTION>
<PARAMEDIC>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (to the driver)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--stop the ambulance.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ambulance pulls over and the back doors fly open. DEAN leaps out into the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The OTHER CARS pull over and PRATT and JONES exit. They scan the area and see DEAN descending a stairwell marked: METRO.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. METRO STATION PLATFORM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DEAN stands at the end of the crowded platform. PRATT and JONES work through the CROWD as the train pulls in. DEAN slides on board. The departure HORN sounds. JONES and PRATT step on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. METRO - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DEAN huddles in the back car, panic-breathing, as PRATT and JONES move through the cars searching for faces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DEAN looks for an out. He sees an emergency stop handle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He YANKS it forward. PASSENGERS yell. The brakes lock and SCREECH. The train slows. Then stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DEAN opens the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And jumps. He looks around. Just black curved track in either direction. He starts running.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he hears it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The horrible SCREECHING of an approaching train.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trapped.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On one side, the train he left. On the other, a wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He runs down the track with all that's left.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PRATT and JONES reach the open door and see the oncoming train bearing down on DEAN. They duck in as the train SWISHES by.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DEAN lays flat between the tracks, his face kissing greasy ground as the train screeches over him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tons of angry steel are teasing his shirt fabric.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then it's over. The train's gone. DEAN's alive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He gets up to see PRATT and JONES leap to the tracks.
</DIRECTION>
<DEAN>
<DIRECTION>
(under his breath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hate these guys.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEAN>
<DIRECTION>
Then he sees an "EMERGENCY ACCESS" sign beaming in the darkness. A God-send. DEAN runs for it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. METRO EMERGENCY ACCESS EXIT - NIGHT

PRATT and JONES fly out the door and into a park.

EXT. RACHEL'S CONDO BUILDING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DEAN watches from the shadows. It seems quiet. He's about to move for the entrance when he sees--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A cigarette lighter flame-up inside a parked car. TWO MEN sit inside, watching. DEAN retreats into the shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RACHEL'S CONDO - BACK ENTRANCE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quiet. DEAN listens through the door and hears nothing. He KNOCKS softly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No reply.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He tries the doorknob. It opens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RACHEL'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DEAN enters. The place is still.
</DIRECTION>
<DEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rachel?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEAN>
<DIRECTION>
No answer. DEAN drifts through the living room. A lamp is knocked over on the floor. DEAN keeps moving into the bedroom. He stops in the doorway - eyes fixed inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DEAN'S POV: RACHEL lies on her stomach, naked in bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DEAN>
<DIRECTION>
(approaching)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rachel?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEAN>
<DIRECTION>
She doesn't respond. He touches her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns her over. Her face is frozen, eyes open, neck purpled and bruised with signs of strangulation.
</DIRECTION>
<DEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh God--
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEAN>
<DIRECTION>
DEAN wants to throw up but holds it down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, under a night table, he sees a shirt. He grabs it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DEAN'S POV: An oxford button-down. The inside collar is stamped with a dry-cleaner's marker reading: R. DEAN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Panic overtakes horror as DEAN quickly searches for anything else of his that may have been planted inside the apartment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Under the bed - a cufflink.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the bathroom - a hairbrush.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the desk - documents with his name on them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DEAN shoves everything into a garbage bag. Grabbing a towel, he retraces his steps, wiping his prints from everything he touched.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Exiting, he wipes off the doorknob as--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A NEIGHBORS DOOR OPENS. A COUPLE stumbles out, laughing, kissing...and noticing DEAN leaving Rachel's condo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JERRY walks alone through the large underground garage on the way to his car. He pauses, thinking he's heard something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing.

He continues walking. He reaches his car. Suddenly someone comes up behind him fast. JERRY spins--
</DIRECTION>

INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BRILL and DEAN enter the 2nd story of a large, empty structure. DEAN is carrying a crumpled, brown paper bag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the center of the cavernous space, a windowless, cinderblock room built on 5-foot supports.
</DIRECTION>
<BRILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I call it the jar. No phone or utility lines going in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRILL>
<DIRECTION>
BRILL opens a side door revealing a mini-generator. He pushes the start button. The generator HUMS to life.
</DIRECTION>
<BRILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Self-contained. Unplugged from the world.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(opening Jar door)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing for a wire bug to piggy- back in on. That leaves only transmitters and signal sweep for those.

<DIRECTION>
(turning on the light)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now let's see what we got.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRILL>
<DIRECTION>
DEAN tosses the paper bag to BRILL, who empties its contents (the pieces of the GameBoy) on to the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DOCKS - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DEAN sits alone, smoking a cigarette, and watching Norfolk rise from dawn's fog.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the distance we see BRILL coming down from the warehouse toward DEAN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stands behind DEAN for a moment before...
</DIRECTION>
<BRILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That is one ugly sunrise.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE SECOND WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DEAN and BRILL are kneeling beside the Chevy, letting the air out of the tires.
</DIRECTION>
<BRILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Empty 'em 'till they're almost flat. And turn your head. There might be some debris flying your way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRILL>
<DEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEAN>
<DIRECTION>
And with that, THE FIRST WAREHOUSE EXPLODES, sending a fireball of debris in all directions.
</DIRECTION>
<DEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the fuck?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEAN>
<BRILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They shouldn't have come without calling first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRILL>
<DIRECTION>
BRILL jumps into the Chevy, turns the key and the engine ignites. DEAN leaps in. BRILL stomps on the gas and tires screech. The Chevy hurtles through the warehouse toward a shut garage door. BRILL clicks a remote. The door rises.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUTSIDE THE WAREHOUSE - The Chevy roars outward, screams around a corner, then speeds down a road lined with warehouses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DEAN looks down an intersecting road to glimpse a Saturn sedan gaining on a parallel road.
</DIRECTION>
<BRILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's your gun?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRILL>
<DIRECTION>
They pass an area with no warehouses. The Saturn turns, heading straight at them.
</DIRECTION>
<DEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Back at the warehouse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEAN>
<DIRECTION>
The Saturn pulls on the road behind them. The MAN in the Saturn leans out and fires an assault rifle. The side window by Dean's head shatters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BRILL one-hands the pistol and checks the load.
</DIRECTION>
<DEAN>
<DIRECTION>
(re: the pistol)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gimme that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEAN>
<BRILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sure?

</BRILL>
<DEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're driving.

<DIRECTION>
(taking the pistol)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't see a warrant. Did you see a warrant?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEAN>
<DIRECTION>
The Chevy enters a narrow lane, the Saturn right behind. With the Chevy's tires flat and flapping, the Saturn hugs their rear. DEAN looks back again as the RIFLEMAN FIRES--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rear window EXPLODES. DEAN pops up and fires three quick, well-placed rounds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Saturn swerves and drops back. BRILL's impressed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DEAN looks forward to see an exit road blocked by an iron cross-bar. BRILL, unfazed, pushes the Chevy faster. Beam or no beam, he's going through.
</DIRECTION>
<BRILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Think we let out enough air?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRILL>
<DEAN>
<DIRECTION>
(realizing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEAN>
<DIRECTION>
BRILL and DEAN hit the deck as the Chevy's hood scrapes just under the beam. The windshield frame takes the full impact. The beam slices through steel and glass, decapitating the car. They emerge on the other side minus roof and windows as--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--the Saturn SCREECH-STOPS inches from the beam and debris. A MAN leaps out, shoulders his rifle and aims--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--but the Chevy disappears around a building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HIGHWAY - EARLY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A foggy morning. The rural highway's deserted at this early hour. The Chevy rumbles by...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHEVY - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DEAN and BRILL, windblown but alive, remove shards of glass. BRILL eyes the road behind him.
</DIRECTION>

Empty.

<BRILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We lost 'em.

<BRILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I can see where that'd--
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRILL>
<DIRECTION>
He stops talking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He hears ROTOR THUMPS as a black HELICOPTER appears over a fog-laced hillside, swooping down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BRILL floors it. The helicopter drops in closer as BRILL swerves back and forth while taking a curve at 70- plus on flapping tires. A helicopter SHARP-SHOOTER aims with an M-16.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A spray of high-powered slugs suddenly rip into the Chevy's hood. The engine starts knocking.
</DIRECTION>
<BRILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These guys are incredibly persistent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRILL>
<DEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEAN>
<DIRECTION>
The road straightens. Up ahead, a tunnel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
More bullets slice the hood. Radiator fluid starts hissing. The Chevy starts dying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BRILL stomps the pedal, squeezing out every last kick of horsepower.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rubber flaps. Tires shred. Steam hisses. Bullets fly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The helicopter swoops in lower and lower for the kill shot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SHARP-SHOOTER lines DEAN in his sights.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The PILOT keeps pace, dropping closer. The SHARP- SHOOTER has the shot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Chevy reaches the tunnel's opening on sparking, screeching wheel rims.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The helicopter pulls up, missing the hill by inches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But not the power lines. The PILOT sees them too late. The helicopter flies into a web of cables. The upper rotor slices neatly off. The helicopter's body rockets downward to the road where it bounces and skids like a rock on water until it meets an oncoming semi-truck head-on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLAM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. INSIDE THE TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BRILL tries steering but metal wheels on concrete don't work. The car shimmies like it's on ice. Sparks fly as they bash into the tunnel wall, grinding to a stop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DODGE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A GRUNGE-DUDE blasts his car-stereo as he enters the tunnel, unaware of the mayhem behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He slows, seeing a smoking wreck ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Closer, he sees DEAN waving him down. He slows more. Bad move.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BRILL opens the rear door, leaps in, and points his pistol at the GRUNGE-DUDE's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DEAN leaps in front.
</DIRECTION>
<BRILL>

	</DIALOGUE>
</BRILL>
<DIRECTION>
DEAN slides into the driver's seat, drops it in gear and goes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Dodge erupts from the tunnel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Up ahead, the Saturn and another car approach fast in the opposite lane, speeding toward the tunnel's opening. The car's fly by, unaware of DEAN and BRILL passing in the Dodge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Dodge continues on, fading into the fog.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, it looks as if they've made it as they race down an alleyway, only to realize it's a dead-end.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BRILL slams into reverse. They screech backward, tires smoking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Too late. The squad car rips into the alleyway, boxing them in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BRILL hits the brakes. He looks back at the dead-end and sees an empty flat-bed trailer with a ramp. BRILL gives it everything. If they can get enough speed and hit the ramp right, maybe they can clear the obstructing wall.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They aren't going anywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Back in the alley, the squad car skids to a stop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A ROOKIE climbs from his car, leaps the wall, draws his gun and nears...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside the Taurus, the windows are shattered. Steam hisses, gasoline drips and coal is everywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DEAN shimmies out through a broken side window. He barely gets to his feet as he stumbles 20 yards or so.
</DIRECTION>

His foot accidentally dislodges a large pile of coal, which buries him up to his waist and immobilizes him.

KRUG digs quickly through the coal pile, searching for Dean. Then BRILL sees him--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BRILL's POV: DEAN down off the side of the coal-car, lodged in the coal pile. He's safe, but not once KRUG discovers he's not in the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BRILL pushes in the cigarette lighter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JONES dumps everything from the Taurus into the unmarked car. SIRENS suddenly fade in.
</DIRECTION>

KRUG digs faster, looking for DEAN, as JONES approaches with his pistol, clambering around for BRILL.
</DIRECTION>
<KRUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck him, he's dead in two minutes. Find Dean.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRUG>
<DIRECTION>
JONES starts to back out, just as the Taurus's cigarette lighter pops out. BRILL grabs it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KRUG eyes the glowing lighter. Then he eyes BRILL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BRILL ignites the gas. WA-WOOMFF!! A fireball explodes, consuming all - the car, BRILL, KRUG. JONES is blown off his feet from the concussion.

All hand signals, no words, as the trio ascend the staircase.

One flight, two. Then HICKS stops. The needle says they're close.

HICKS motions. Their target's on two. They move down the hall - silent except for a creaking floor and a TV SHOW drifting from an apartment. Someone's up at this hour.

They move on. HICKS watches the needle as it moves. He motions DAVIS and JONES to a door. JONES puts a reverse-viewer against the peep-hole.
