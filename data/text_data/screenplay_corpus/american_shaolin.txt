WORKOUT AREA ­ SAME NIGHT ESTABLISHING SHOT OF MASTER KWAN'S SCHOOL, A RAMSHACKLE BUILDING IN A BURNED OUT ROW OF STORES. His is the only one still occupied, and it doesn't look that permanent. In the window is a cardboard, handwritten sign that reads "Kwan's Shaolin Kung Fu". What remains visible behind the poster and the security grate is an IMPRESSION of people moving and milling around. INT. WORKOUT AREA ­ SAME NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF KWAN'S SHAOLIN KUNG FU SCHOOL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The students are doing their own thing, and they are a mixture of old and young, men and women. They are not dressed alike, as they would be in a Karate school: they are dressed in old T-shirts and tattered sweat pants. This is not a wealthy school, by any means, and that is typified by the appearance of SIFU KWAN, who is walking through the students as they train. He is wizened old man, 70 years old if he is a day, and he is dressed in a fraying Chinese jacket, scruffy cloth shoes and a discolored Chinese T-shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON A YOUNG ADULT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Struggling through a horse stance, his face in real pain. He is trying his best to hold the stance, but his legs are quivering. He drops out of the stance onto his knees. Master Kwan is right beside him.

<KWAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tiger grasps his tail, not hamburger!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He moves on, studying the room with his eyes, often glancing toward the door, and then toward the small clock on a table near the door. It is late, and Kwan is obviously waiting for someone to arrive. As he is waiting, a young STUDENT comes up to Kwan.
</DIRECTION>
<STUDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Master Kwan, when can I learn flying kicks? I see Bruce Lee...

	Bruce Lee actor, we fighters, warriors. A sparrow in flight is beautiful, but a side kick to the ribs is effective. Show me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KWAN>
<DIRECTION>
The boy shrugs and then starts throwing side kicks. Kwan is half looking at the boy and half looking towards the door and the clock. The boy throws three or four kicks and then stops. He is watching Kwan watching the door. Kwan sees him, and turns back to him.

	A Shaolin warrior lets nothing intrude. Continue, never mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He continues to kick, and Kwan continues to look at the door. Finally, the student stops kicking, half-heartedly bows to the master, and then moves to the side of the workout room. Kwan doesn't know he's gone. Kwan turns around, forgetting for a moment what he is doing, and comes face to face with the mother of a student, MRS. RODRIGUEZ, and she is holding a uniform of some sort. She smiles widely at him and holds up the uniform. It is beautiful, obviously hand made, and on the back is embroidered: "Kwan's Shaolin" and underneath that is "Drew Carson". Kwan takes in the entire outfit, while the rest of the class is gathering around to have a look. They are all very impressed.

This last he says looking at the empty door.
</DIRECTION>
<MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I only hope it brings him luck in the tournament.
	</DIALOGUE>
<KWAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Luck is no concern, Mrs. Rodriguez. Shaolin warriors depend on heart and soul ­ that's how they saved the T'ang emporer.

<DIRECTION>
(to class) During my time training at the Shaolin Temple, the birthplace of the martial arts, I was lucky (glance at Mrs. Rodriguez)... er... fortunate to have the best instructors in the world train me. But, there was also time for individual training ­ where skills were honed like the blade of a sword. Now, it is that time for you.

The others mutter "No" and shake their heads, confused.

<DIRECTION>
CARSON, a muscular 16/17 year old, bowls of flaming wax on his bare shoulders, moving through the garage, practicing his kung fu maneuvers. He is kicking, punching, etc., occasionally spilling hot wax on his skin (INSERT). In the background is a TV, and on it is showing a martial arts movie. ANGLE ON KWAN Who is quietly settling into a shadowy corner of the garage, watching Drew. ANGLE ON DREW As he continues to move around the workout area, his arms and body moving as he tries to match the movements on the TV. Suddenly, Kwan jumps out of the shadows, attacking. Drew reacts instantly, evading the attack, the wax sloshing around in the bowls but not spilling (INSERT SHOT HERE). Kwan continues the attack, and Drew evades, their movements matching the movements on the TV almost move for move. It is a beautiful ballet, and Drew ends it by sweeping Kwan down to the ground. When Kwan hits the ground, hard, his face is lit by the TV screen.

He hurries over to his master, a concerned look on his face.
</DIRECTION>

He leans down to help Kwan up, forgetting about the bowls of hot wax. It pours down on Kwan, scalding him, as well as running down Drew's chest. Kwan struggles to get up, while at the same time trying to wipe the hot wax off.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Why didn't you come to class? Why waste time with this... Should study tapes of opponent.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll still win. Besides, the Shaolin monks never had tapes to study... they did it this way... right?

</DIRECTION>
<PFEELGUT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not enough just to win, Trevor. You have to destroy your opponent completely, mentally and physically. Beat him once, he's a threat. Humiliate him, and he'll fear you forever.
	</DIALOGUE>

Trevor listens to this, nods his head once, and when Pfeelgut goes to leave, Trevor pushes him into the pool. Pfeelgut comes to the surface, smiling.

around Drew's waist and pulls. They face off ("20 seconds" comes the call), and Trevor charges. As Drew blocks, his pants begin to sag. Trevor, not trying to score, just trying to keep Drew's hands busy, keeps coming. Drew's pants drop lower and lower. When they get around his knees, he finally notices them, and reaches down to get them. Trevor drives and picks him up in a throw, effectively showing Drew's bare ass to the world. CUT AWAY to crowd laughing, girls shocked, cameras poised and recording, one mom puts her hands over her daughter's eyes, etc. Trevor dumps Drew and scores the final point, just as time runs out.

Drew continues to explore, looking for someone to talk to. He wanders into another hall, following the O.S. sounds of CHANTING. Once inside this hall, he sees a group of monks, amid hanging incense burners and paper lanterns, sitting down on the floor chanting in rhythm. No one notices that Drew is standing there. The monks eyes are open, but they don't seem to see him. He stands there for a moment, then shrugs and walks out of that hall. He goes into a corridor, then passes the "Wooden Man Chamber".

Drew turns his head, and a procession of kids about his age (some older and some younger) come walking into the courtyard.

The front door to the temple opens wide, and a column of monks, all in their best saffron robes, are lined up waiting to receive them.

The crowd has stopped and is watching the drama unfold. Drew gets up warily, expecting some trick. The Drill Sergeant motions again, wanting Drew to hurry up. Drew looks at Ashema and her Bau Bau and smiles. He picks up his backpack and starts towards the temple, limping from sitting for so long. The crowd goes crazy, clapping and yelling.

As they walk by, some of the monks look nonplused, while a few are put out by the fact that Drew is among them.

Several of the disciples turn around to look at Drew, and a couple are openly hostile to him.

<DIRECTION>
They file up to a raised platform, on which stand 20 monks, each holding a scroll in their hands, one monk for every new disciple.

The Drill Sergeant nods his head.
</DIRECTION>
<MONK>

Then, another gong sounds, and the quizzing is concluded. A figure moves down a corridor in beautiful robes. Everyone bows down, their eyes on the floor, to the figure, who is moving towards the raised platform in the center. Drew, also bowed down, sneaks a peak at the figure. It is San De! San De catches his eye and smiles slightly. He winks at Drew, then clears his throat. Everyone stands up again.

Gongs go off, firecrackers are set off, and a special flag is raised on the flag pole. A roar comes from the crowd outside. ANGLE ON THE DISCIPLES All of whom are happy. All, that is, except for Gao, who is staring at Drew. Drew, notices the stare.

Drew immediately shoves him and tries to grab the robes back. Gao smiles and moves away, holding the robes up and away from Drew. Drew is pissed and ready to go after Gao. Before he can, however, LI, another disciple, grabs another set of robes from the table and gives it to Drew, pulling him away from the confrontation.

Drew looks at Gao, and Gao looks at Drew. There is a pause, one that is very uncomfortable. Finally, Drew speaks.

<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Shaolin martial tradition is built on challenges. We challenge ourselves, but we do not fight with each other. Never do we fight to see who is best ­ we train to be able to right wrongs, not to let our hands and feet express emotions run wild. A Shaolin never throws a punch or kick in anger.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shake hands and let your emotions go.

Gao looks at Drew, knowing that the anger is already long gone, swept away in the shock of Drew taking the blame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They shake hands.

Both Drew and Gao notice the Golden Sash hanging on the wall. It is occupying a place of honor.
</DIRECTION>
<SAN_DE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That is the Golden Sash, the highest honor of the temple. It is awarded to the monk who has attained the pinnacle of understanding.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The best fighter?
	</DIALOGUE>
<SAN_DE>

San De nods.
</DIRECTION>
<SAN_DE>

	Return to your training.

Drew and Gao get up, bow to San De and head for the door. They get to the door at the same time, however, and for a moment they jockey for position, trying to be the first one through the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, Drew tires of the game and opens the door for Gao.
</DIRECTION>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ten more seconds and I would have kicked your ass...

Immediately, other figures land with PUFFs of dust all around him. As soon as they have all landed, they move off.

<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON GROUP As they sneak through the courtyards and training areas of the temple. They are about halfway across from the front door of the temple when a monk comes walking towards them. He is weaving and bobbing ­ he looks drunk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Drew shoots Li and Gao a questioning look. Drunk? In the temple? They take refuge behind a couple of the columns and watch as the monk makes his way past, weaving and throwing kicks and punches. It is a tense moment as the monk comes uncomfortably close to where Drew and Gao are standing, but he walks on.

It isn't happening. The boys are on one side, the girls are on the other. The music is bad Chinese rock and roll.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The only ones together are Drew and Ashema, who are talking in the center of the room. The disciples are all clustered together, staring at the walls and the ceiling. A group of giggle girls are standing around Drew and Ashema. A group of toughs are standing at one side of the party room, observing everything that's going on. ANGLE ON DREW AND ASHEMA

<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great party...

</DIRECTION>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He turns back to Ashema, but she is pulled back by the giggle girls, away from danger. The tough spins Drew around and pushes him HARD. One of the toughs has already gotten behind him, on his knees, and Drew goes flipping over the tough, landing hard on the ground, the wind knocked out of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Drew gets up, wincing, not really ready to fight.

The tough pulls his fist back to strike Drew, who has been grabbed by two other toughs, his arms pinned behind his back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, a figure FLIES in and SLAMS the tough to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is Gao, and he immediately sets on the other toughs. The room ERUPTS in a melee as the disciples go at it with the village toughs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The girls are SCREAMING as the boys kick and punch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The disciples are winning, having a great time, until the door to the room SLAMS open and the HEADMISTRESS comes storming in, screaming at the top of her lungs for them to stop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON DREW, GAO AND THE DISCIPLES

<DIRECTION>
Also in the room are two high-ranking police officials. The Headmistress is yelling at the top of her lungs, and San De is just sitting there, letting her vent. She has obviously been going at it for some time, because her face is sweaty and flushed. She stops when Drew and the D.S. enter and points an accusing finger at Drew.

	This is a serious issue, there is no question. This we will have to take under advisement ­ but we will handle matters of this temple.

	This involves more than just the temple. I am authorized to escort him from your temple to the jail now, tonight, where he will be held until he leaves the country.

<D_S>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Master, may I?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(San De nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

She is about to speak, but thinks better of it. San De stands up, signalling that the meeting is over.

(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to face the American who is now a Shaolin monk! I want to learn at the hands of a master!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd, who has seen Drew and heard about him for quite a while, warms to the prospect. They start cheering for the American Shaolin to face Trevor.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want the American Shaolin!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON DREW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Who doesn't know what to do. San De appears and puts a comforting hand on his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON TREVOR Pointing and yelling for Drew. ANGLE ON DREW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Who climbs the ropes and goes into the ring. The crowd is going crazy, eager to see the match. Drew, oblivious to the crowd, walks over to Trevor.
</DIRECTION>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I came to the Shaolin Temple because of you, Trevor. You humiliated me, and I wanted to make sure it could never happen again.
	</DIALOGUE>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, let's see what you've learned.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DREW>
<DIRECTION>
(shaking his head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've learned that... there's nothing to prove. Beating you is no longer important. It was my ego that had to be defeated, not you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bull! You're just chicken!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The arts should never be about who is best ­ they are too important for that.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He bows to Trevor and starts out of the ring.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON CROWD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They don't know what's going on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON LI, GAO AND OTHERS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They don't know either. They want Drew to fight him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON SAN DE AND D.S. Who know what is happening and are proud of Drew, prouder than they have ever been.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	COME BACK HERE! You can't just walk away!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Drew steps out of the ring and walks over to where San De is standing. They bow, and the pride is shining in San De's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<SAN_DE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you turn away from him out of fear?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON TREVOR Who is seething.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought the Shaolin monks were warriors, not babies! Look at him ­ he is too scared to face me!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON DREW His face calm.
</DIRECTION>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, master. I will not fight for personal glory, or for my ego.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SAN_DE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have learned much.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON TREVOR
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>

	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON SAN DE
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON TREVOR
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about you, baldy? Or you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He is pointing at Li and Gao and the others, who are itching to climb into the ring. Gao goes over to San De, and shoots a questioning look at Drew.
</DIRECTION>
<GAO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Master, the American is insulting the Temple, and the fighting monks.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SAN_DE>
<DIRECTION>
(looking at drew)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What should be done?
	</DIALOGUE>
<GAO>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Someone should face him in combat. For the tradition of the temple.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
San De looks at Drew long and hard.
</DIRECTION>
<SAN_DE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are some times when a Shaolin must fight, and some people who will not learn until they are taught a lesson.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON DREW Who understands the implication of what he is saying. He starts to smile slowly.
</DIRECTION>
<SAN_DE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's your call.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Drew nods, then turns to face the ring, where Trevor is still standing, trying to get someone to fight him. Drew walks with Gao back to the side of the ring. He turns to Gao and Li and together they high-five.
</DIRECTION>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For the temple...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Drew climbs into the ring.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd is going crazy. Trevor has a predator's grin on his face as he sits down in his corner to get ready to start the match. Immediately, his contingent of people start to work on him ­ massage, drinks, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON DREW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Who sits alone in the other corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON LI AND GAO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Who see the difference. Immediately, they mobilize the other monks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON GAO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Who pulls a drink from one of the men in the crowd, and rushes up to give it to Drew.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON DREW'S CORNER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As it is flooded with monks. Some of them are massaging Drew (painfully), others are stretching his legs out, others waving towels to bring air to him, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The referee signals for the fighters to come to the center. They do, and he motions for them to bow to each other.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Remember last time, punk?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing exists but the moment, and...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... I'm going to enjoy it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They back up, and the fight begins. Trevor attacks hard, but Drew avoids easily, using all soft gong fu.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He continues to attack, throwing flashy technique after flashy technique, but he can't touch Drew.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay still, dammit! Stand and fight!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
And he dances out of the way. Trevor is getting more and more angry. Soon, Drew tires of this game and decides to end this quickly. He goes after Trevor, and it is immediately obvious that Trevor is completely outclassed. Drew scores on Trevor at will, and soon has Trevor totally confused and helpless with a mixture of high kicks, takedowns, flips and punches. Trevor drops to one knee, his hands down at his side, note even bothering to defend himself. Drew grabs Trevor by the front of his uniform and pulls back his right hand in a fist. He is going to put him out with a good old- fashioned roundhouse punch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON LI AND GAO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yelling for the knock out blow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON D.S. AND SAN DE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Worried about this latest development.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Instead, however, Drew smiles and lifts Trevor up and shakes his hand, putting an arm around him to steady him in front of the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor looks into Drew's face, wondering why Drew would do such a thing. When he sees Drew's friendly face, he knows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
To teach him a lesson.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor smiles and holds up Drew's hand as the champion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd goes crazy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON LI AND GAO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Who also get the message. ANGLE ON SAN DE AND D.S. Who knew the message all along.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDE ANGLE OF ENTIRE RING Drew and Trevor standing together in the center. The monks on the side climb into the ring to celebrate with Drew. EXT. GREAT WALL ­ MORNING ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW STANDING ON THE GREAT WALL, THE SUNSET OVER HIS SHOULDER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is doing the beginning of a Shaolin form. When he finishes the salute, a figure comes toward him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is San De, and he has something in his hands. Drew bows to San De, and San De holds THE GOLDEN SASH out to him. Drew takes it and San De bows to him. Drew can't stand it anymore, and rushes up to San De. He gives him a hug. ANGLE ON SAN DE Who is not used to shows of affection. He is lost for a moment, then his face softens and he returns Drew's embrace. They break and bow again, and San De moves off. Drew stands there holding the Golden Sash, the rising sun of the first day of the rest of his life shining in the b.g. ANGLE ON ASHEMA Who comes up to Drew, taking his arm and walks with him along the Great Wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
