Darkness. Distant sounds of freeway traffic. Then the closer sound of a car - its headlights illumine an oleander bush and the limbs of an Eucalyptus tree.

The driver, still in his seat, has a pistol with a silencer attached pointing at the woman. The other man is getting out of the car. The woman is clutching the seat and the door handle as if trying to anchor herself. She is visibly afraid. The man who got out of the car tries the woman's door, but it is locked. He smiles as he reaches in through the front door and unlocks her door. He opens her door. As he reaches for her, the woman's face becomes flooded with light. Her eyes dart to the front windshield. The driver, flooded with light, turns just as the late model sedan slams into the Cadillac limousine. There is an explosion of metal and glass amidst thunderous tearing sounds as the two cars become one in death. The convertible screams past with hardly a notice. The driver of the limousine dies instantly as his body is jettisoned through the windshield. The other man is torn as the cars screech over him. The woman is brutally thrown into the back of the front seats as a cloud of dust and flying rocks engulfs her. The disastrous moving sculpture of the two cars wants to climb up the hill, then stops and slides back toward the road The Cadillac tips onto its side. Then all is silent. A fire erupts in the sedan and as the dust clears we see the woman appear, then crawl out of the Cadillac to the road. Her face is vacant. There is a bleeding cut just above her forehead. She stands for a moment clutching her purse - lost , then begins to walk as if in a trance across Mulholland down through the bushes and into darkness.

The woman then loses control and runs at the coyote and it races off. She falls to the ground. We can hear the thunder of her heartbeat as the sirens grow louder. She gets up and stumbles through the trees. When she clears them she is standing overlooking all of Los Angeles glowing down below. She clumsily starts down toward it.

Of course, I'd rather be known as a great actress than a movie star, but sometimes people end up being both and that is, I guess you'd say, sort of why I came here.

Two men are in the room, JOE and ED. Joe leans up against a rack of filing cabinets. He is in his late twenties. He looks like a run down, heavy metal rocker - wears a blue denim shirt open, T-shirt underneath, black denim jeans and motorcycle boots. His black belt has silver studs. He's smoking a cigarette and is laughing at something the man at the desk has said. His laugh is easy and his grin is infectious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man at the desk, Ed, wears a clean, crisp black suit, like a business man's but unlike a business man his blonde hair is long enough to go over his shoulders.

Looking like he's rubbing the small of his back Joe moves over to Ed at his desk. Joe looks down to the surface of the desk - to a small worn black book.

</ED>
<DIRECTION>
Joe's hand still at the small of his back moves into view holding a silenced pistol and in one swift move reaches out and fires a hole through Ed's temple - blowing Ed's brains out across the desk, carpet and wall. Ed's head bangs down on the desk, then is still save the leaking of blood from the wounds. Joe flips his finished cigarette out the open window behind Ed's desk, wipes the gun clean with a handkerchief and places the cleaned gun in Ed's right hand. He places Ed's right forefinger gently onto the trigger. As he puts the finger on the trigger he presses a little too hard and the gun goes off. The bullet shoots out and penetrates the cheap wall at the far end of Ed's office. Joe hears a muffled scream.

</JOE>

With a sense of "just more stuff I got to do" Joe moves slowly and begrudgingly out of Ed's office, checks the corridor and goes toward the screaming which still persists. He opens up the office door next to Ed's and finds a heavy set woman screaming bloody murder as she is grabbing her buttock and lower back. He sighs and walks over to her and cups his hand tightly around her mouth to squelch the screaming. Wide-eyed, she tries to fight him off and he begins dragging her out of her office. Joe's foot catches on a computer cable clumsily taped across the floor and he falls backwards bringing the heavy woman down with a bone-crushing blow on top of him. The woman begins beating his face with her meaty fists. Joe snaps her head back, instantly stilling her violent activity. He wrestles the stunned heavyweight back to her feet and out her door. He pushes and pulls her into Ed's office. Just before they enter, Joe notices a man with a vacuum cleaner watching him from the far end of the corridor. He stops and calls to the man.

</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
Joe pushes the woman inside Ed's office, throws a glance back down the corridor and sees the man is on his way to him, pushing his industrial vacuum and trailing a 200 ft. long thick black cord as he goes. Joe goes in to Ed's office with the woman. He throws her down on the floor in line between Ed's desk and the bullet hole in the wall. She starts screaming immediately and struggles to get up. Joe grabs the pistol from Ed's dead hand and lifts it to fire, but the woman has turned around and is almost standing.

He goes to her, slaps her hard in the face and spins her around. Before she can turn again Joe races back to place himself in the proper line at Ed's desk and quickly fires two silenced shots into the back of her head. The man with the vacuum enters. His eyes begin to widen in reaction to the scene. Just then Joe fires a bullet into the man's chest. The man inadvertently flicks on the vacuum cleaner as his hands rush up to the wound. As the vacuum cleaner whines Joe rushes to the man before the man falls back out into the corridor. He pulls him into the room - the man moaning and clutching his chest, starting to collapse. Joe releases him and the man goes down. The vacuum cleaner seems to be screeching now in the threshold. Joe fires the last bullet into the heavy duty vacuum cleaner. The bullet shorts out the internal wiring of the vacuum. That in turn blows the building's circuit breaker and all the lights go out.

	No Grandpa, you wouldn't believe it. It's more beautiful than I ever dreamed ... no she left me a lot of food. The refrigerator's full ... Aunt Ruthie said she'd call me when she got settled... it was real smooth. I sat next to a lady who gave up her first class seat to a boy with a broken leg. She was so nice to me. She invited me to her house sometime. It's in Bel Air which is a place where people have a lot of money... I will. Everybody's telling me to be careful, but I sure love it here Grandpa. Thank you for helping me get here ... yeah, it's long distance. I love you. Say hello to Grams. Give her a big kiss for me. Okay, I love you Grandpa ... bye.

Betty rinses her dishes in the kitchen sink and pours herself a cup of coffee. She takes the coffee outside to the courtyard - to a white metal table just outside her doorway. She sits down and stretches in the warm afternoon sun. Across the way she can hear a blues saxophonist practicing in one of the apartments. She drinks her coffee and listens to the music.

Some birds fly by overhead. She takes another sip of coffee. The blues music which was mellow and slow is now building in tempo and volume. The phone inside rings.

Adam feeling like a fool drives up the dark, winding canyon road. As he nears the top of the canyon the residential area gives way to desert brush. The road winds steeply up to a dark dead end where an old barn and stable sit. Adam parks in a little dirt lot and walk up past the barn to the corral. His eyes grow accustomed to the dark and he.looks about. No one is around. There's only a light wind and a few twinkling stars in the sky above. Suddenly some bare bulbs hanging from the corral gate flare up. Adam hears a noise in the brightness and turns. There walking toward him into the light is the Cowboy - dressed in clean blue denim jeans, well-oiled unscuffed, beautifully engraved cowboy boots, a red embroidered ivory buttoned cowboy shirt complete with string tie. Atop the Cowboy's head is a 10 X white Stetson. The Cowboy is smiling warmly as he approaches. He stops in front of Adam and begins to speak with a true, slow Western drawl.

	... realizin' you don't have hardly a nickel to your name and then add on to that the sickenin' feeling some men are gonna catch you and hurt you bad for bustin' their vehicle. Some days are like that. They are rough, but what will tomorrow bring? Will it be better than today? The same ... or worse? A lot of that is up to us individually. Up to us and our attitude. When the Castigliane brothers said "This is no longer your film," they meant it, but they didn't mean you were not going to direct it. I want you to go back to work tomorrow. You were re-casting the lead actress anyway ... audition many girls for the part. When you see the girl that was shown to you earlier today, you will say " This is the girl." The rest of the cast can stay- that is up to you, but that lead girl is not up to you. Now, you will see me one more time if you do good. You will see me two more times if you do bad. Good night.

So, Dr. Scott's laughin' you know like he does 'cause he knows we want to talk to this guy. He's laughin' you know and shakin'... Son of a bitch couldn't stop laughin'...

<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I came back. I thought that's what you wanted.

</JIMMY>

Jimmy plays this with a big lecherous smile. He gives the last part of the line across her cheek up to her ear.
</DIRECTION>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nobody wants you here.

Betty uses the anger of this line to push herself away from Jimmy. Jimmy reaches out and grabs her wrist.

<DIRECTION>
He grabs Betty by the wrist again and pulls her in to him. He puts his hand on her waist and it accidently slips and keeps going down her hips. He jerks his hand back. Betty looks down and sees Jimmy's hand hovering above her thigh. Betty takes her hand and gently presses down on Jimmy's hand. She slowly looks up with the most seductive smile. Jimmy lets his hand rest more firmly on her thigh, and squeezes her thigh as he sees her smile. With his other hand Jimmy gently pulls her closer. Something has started coming over Betty and she catches the drift of this scene in a different way. She's surprising herself.
</DIRECTION>
<BETTY>
<DIRECTION>
(almost a hot whisper)

	<DIALOGUE>
	You're playing a dangerous game here. if you're trying to blackmail me... it's not going to work.

Jimmy now surprises himself. He becomes almost tender and genuinely worked up from the heat coming off Betty.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what I want...it's not that difficult.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Where the scene should turn to anger from Betty it can't now and Betty plays it as she feels it. She stays in very close to Jimmy - looking him right in the eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<BETTY>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering desperately - slowly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get out... Get out before I call my dad. He trusts you... you're his best friend.

(her arms go around him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This will be the end of everything.

Jimmy gets lost. He doesn't know where he is anymore. He can only see Betty's eyes.

<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about you? What will your dad think about you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Betty still playing it in a dreamy whisper... lost in heat.
</DIRECTION>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop... just stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before...

Jimmy panics and pushes Betty away with his hands on her shoulders as if forcing himself to come out of a trance. He finally is able to say his line.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then they'd put you in jail.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
As scripted Betty is supposed to cry now and it is very easy for her to do this because she's ashamed at how the sex of the scene took her over. Tears begin running down her cheeks. She backs away.

She pretends to drop the knife. The scene ends.

INT. - RECORDING STUDIO - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see what looks like a recording studio right out of the 1960's. We're looking through a plate of glass. A blonde girl is standing at a vintage microphone. Behind her are three back-up male vocalists dressed in three tone, shiny 60's suits. We hear strings soar up and the blonde girl begins to sing SIXTEEN REASONS by Connie Stevens. The male vocalists backing her up flawlessly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We move back and realize we are on a movie set inside a sound stage. A screen test is being shot of the girl and as we continue moving back we see the director Adam Kesher surrounded by his crew. Behind them there are many people standing, eating, watching, working. The stage is full and bustling. The song plays loudly over. Sarah and Nicki bring Betty into this scene through a giant stage door. A guard mimes for them to be quiet as they approach the set. The song continues to play over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Sarah leads Betty up close Adam turns and his eyes fall on the beautiful face of Betty Elms. Sensing something Betty turns and sees Adam. They each seem to feel the thrill of the thunderbolt, but each embarrassed to stare longer than they already have turn back and watch the girl finish the song.

Adam continues to watch Camilla Rhodes sing. JASON GOLDWYN, a tall sixty year old silver-haired man, comes through the crowd and stops at Adam's side. He looks down at Adam, but Adam continues watching Camilla Rhodes. Jason follows Adam's gaze and he watches Camilla sing then turns back to Adam. Adam slowly looks up right into Jason's eyes - wondering how much Jason knows, but Jason's face doesn't give away a thing.

Great chunks of mattress are standing upright having been ripped and torn by shotgun blasts. A dried sea of blood surrounds the bloated, gray body of the woman. The scream comes out of Rita as a force propelling her to look closer. Betty lunges after Rita, her eyes also not able to leave the sight. She covers Rita's mouth with her hand and brings her close. The scream is stifled by Betty's hand.

INT. AUNT RUTH'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rita has just taken the hatbox from the closet shelf and is setting it on the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<DIRECTION>
Betty is sitting on the bed opposite. Rita opens the hatbox and removes her purse. She opens the purse and takes out the money. She sits down on the bed and while staring at the money she thinks of what to say.
</DIRECTION>
<RITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've been so good to me ... now we know why ... why I was so afraid. We know what kind of trouble I'm in. I shouldn't... ask you... I only have this to offer. I'll give you this if I can stay here for awhile. I don't know what else to do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RITA>
<DIRECTION>
Betty moves across the bed to the side of Rita. She puts her arm around Rita and holds her.
</DIRECTION>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rita... I want you to stay here and you don't have to give me that money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<RITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I want to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RITA>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. We shouldn't touch that money. We don't know about that money. That might be dangerous money. You have to start all over again. You look like a brand new person and you can be a brand new person... whoever you want to be.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<RITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It sounds kind of nice ... being somebody brand new.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RITA>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, let's introduce the brand new you to Hollywood. We haven't seen the roof garden yet.

The girls come out the front door ... Betty leading and pulling a much happier Rita along with her. They half run across the courtyard to stone steps under an Ivy covered eave.

EXT. ROOF GARDEN - NIGHT

The girls race up the stone steps toward us. Soon their wind- blown, smiling faces fill the screen as they look out. There before them are the lights of Hollywood with silhouetted palms, slow-moving theater kleig lights, and floating above it all the giant sign in the hills reading HOLLYWOOD.
</DIRECTION>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here I am Hollywood! My name's Betty.

They look out, maybe waiting for an answer blowing in the Santa Ana wind.

We move in to the pile of money next to Rita's purse. Past that we move down inside Rita's purse. We see the Blue Key and move closer to it until it fills the screen.

EXT. DENNY'S RESTAURANT - HOLLYWOOD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We drift along the red bricks past the payphone, along the wall until we come to the corner. Slowly we round the corner and move to a dark alley. There amongst the dumpsters and trash cans is the dark silhouette of a figure. We move closer to the figure. It is the bum and the bum sits. We move closer and the bum's face fills the screen. It's face is black with fungus. It's eyes turn and they seem to be red.
