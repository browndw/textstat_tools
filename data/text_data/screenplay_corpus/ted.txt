INT. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - DAY John and Lori paint the apartment walls. Lori sneaks up behind John, and paints his back. John turns around and grabs her. They scuffle playfully, and then kiss. We ANGLE ON Ted, who stands on a little stepladder hammering a "Home Sweet Home" picture into the wall. He steps back, but realizes he has nailed his hand to the wall. He tugs, slips, and the ladder falls. Ted hangs there like an idiot.

CLOSE ON a bong. PULL OUT TO REVEAL Ted, who inhales, his snout inside the tube. Ted sits on the sofa, and for the first time, we see Ted in his present day form: he is ratty, patched-up, and worn-looking. He has a couple stains, some small spots of exposed stuffing, and there's evidence of some half-assed sewing. It's obvious he's been around for three decades. He and John, who sits next to him, are both clearly stoned as we join them. John, for his part, looks far too comfortable in the too- worn Red Sox T-shirt he wears. He eats directly from a box of Fruity Pebbles. Reaching in for a last handful, he finds the box almost empty. He raises it to empty the remainder into his mouth, and accidentally pours Fruity Pebbles all over his face. It doesn't faze him much, though, as he brushes them off. It's quite obvious that this is a guy who has never really given up his childhood... and has never given up his teddy bear. Ted passes the bong to John.

We see Lori out on the dance floor, amidst a sea of dancing clubgoers. Nearby, we see John dancing with a girl, and doing it very badly. He's putting too much into it, obviously trying to impress her. The girl is gamely tolerating it, but is clearly not digging the moves. John thrusts his butt back in one move, accidentally bumping a girl behind him with enough force to send her sprawling on the floor. As the crowd reacts to this, we see that it is Lori. She starts to get up, when John turns and rushes to help her to her feet.

They circle one another for a beat. John suavely takes off his jacket, twirls it in the air a few times, and tosses it O.S. He then strikes a "finger up" disco pose, with a bullet SFX.

	Look, I've put the best physical years of my life into this. I mean, I'm cute now, but in a few years my body's gonna fall off a fucking cliff. Things'll be hanging and stretching in ways that might scare a man. I need to feel secure in the fact that you won't leave me when that happens.

Lori can't help but let a small laugh escape. She softens a bit...

WIDER ANGLE on the restaurant. For a moment, nothing happens.

Then, a guy at a table on the right (sitting with a couple other men and women) screams into his napkin, followed by his dining companions.

EXT./ESTAB. GROCERY STORE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GROCERY STORE - DAY Ted's boss, Frank, emerges from the back, writing on a clipboard. He looks up, and his expression turns to confused anger as he sees an unusually long line at Ellen's register.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
He walks over to the line. A GUY IN LINE turns and notices him.

	Hey, dude, you think you could open more than one register? There's like a thousand people here!

<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's supposed to be three registers open, for god's sake!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
He looks around, aggravated, for a moment, then storms off toward the back. He looks around the butcher's counter and produce area, then walk into the back storeroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STOREROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank opens the door, and reacts with shock. REVERSE ANGLE where we see Ted on top of Tami Lynn, who is almost naked. He is doing a very close approximation of banging her wildly. We see his furry bear butt pumping away, with its little tail on the end. Frank screams in shock and horror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FRANK'S OFFICE - SHORTLY AFTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank sits at his desk, addressing Ted.

EXT. GROCERY STORE - LATER THAT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see the "CLOSED" sign on the door. Ted exits, finishing off a bottle of beer. He walks around to the dumpster alley, and lines up for a Kareem-style sky hook shot into a trash can. He takes the shot:
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kareem!

The bottle smashes off the side of the can, and shatters.

INT. REX'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The party is a very costly-looking event: uniformed servers walking around with trays of cocktails and hors d'ouvres, tables laden with lavish-looking food displays and floral arrangements, a 20-piece big band, and hundreds of guests. A large banner reads "Happy 20th Anniversary, Plymouth Public Relations."
</DIRECTION>
<REX>

INT. REX'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS - STAIRS AND UPSTAIRS

Rex and John are walking up the stairs to the second floor of his house. Rex points out various items bought at auction. John is visibly unenthused. He does not like this guy, and definitely does not trust him.
</DIRECTION>
<REX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and that's a Wade Boggs autographed bat. Just barely outbid Phil Donahue for that at auction.

	Something, isn't it? Had it freeze-dried and bronzed. Every now and then, when I feel like my life's gettin' me down and things are tough, I just come in here and look at it, and it reminds me that things aren't so bad. That some people have it worse than me. I mean, he's only got one ball, and I have three. One of them, of course, being his.

	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<REX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa, whoa, okay, look, I think I oughtta just clear the air here a little. I... just want you to know that... I mean, yeah, I'm kind of a "fun-time boss" and whatnot, but... look man, I do that with everybody at the office! I'm just a kook! I have no designs on your girlfriend. We work together, and that's it. I think you're a great guy and she's very lucky.

John lands a particularly hard one, which sends Ted flying across the room, and slamming into the wall. Ted hits the floor, and runs out of the bathroom. John stumbles to his feet.

John jumps at Ted, throwing a jab at him. But Ted dodges, and John's fist goes into the wall above the headboard. He struggles to pull free as he flails about with his other hand, grabbing at Ted. Ted dodges again, and scrambles up John's head, jumping up and grabbing the chain on the ceiling fan, turning it on, and causing Ted to swing back and forth. John pulls free, and stumbles backward off the bed. He notices a tall, free-standing lamp in the corner. He pulls the plug out of the wall, and uses the lamp to take a swing at Ted. Ted swings out of the way. John takes a second swing, but the lamp cord catches on the fan's motor. The lamp is ripped from John's grasp, it swings around through the air, and cracks him in the side of the head. John goes down, whacking his head a second time on the baseboard of the bed. He howls in pain as he lies on his stomach, clutching his head. Ted takes advantage of this. He jumps down from the cord, and pulls the antenna off the clock radio next to the bed. He jumps down to the floor, yanks John's pants partway down, and starts whipping his bare ass with the antenna. John yells in fury, and kicks blindly at Ted. He turns over, kicking ted in the face, and kicking the cabinet that the TV is on.

The TV wobbles, and falls off the cabinet, landing with a crash, right on his groin. John lies there, with the TV on his crotch and his pants down, and breathes heavily. Ted, still dazed from the kick to the face, crawls over to him. Both breathe heavily. John's breathing deteriorates into sobs.

Donny carries the sack inside, and unceremoniously dumps Ted onto the floor. Ted looks around. It's just as shitty on the inside as on the outside.

Ted nervously moves down the hallway toward the front door. He has it in sight on the far end of the living room, but when he gets closer to the living room doorway, he sees that Donny is sitting in an armchair, watching The Incredible Hulk (the old TV show). Ted darts back into the hallway before he's seen, but in the process, bumps into a small table with a lamp and a couple knick knacks on it. One of them, a small ceramic penguin, falls over, making a sound. Donny turns and looks in the direction of the hallway.

Donny grabs Ted and flings him off his face, onto the floor on the passengers' side. Donny rips the sack off his head, and reacts as he looks out the front window. He's approaching the end of the tunnel, and there is opposing traffic moving in the other direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BOSTON CITY STREETS - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS Donny swerves past the traffic, narrowly avoiding clipping one of the cars. A moment later, John and Lori come racing out of the tunnel. However, a truck drives through the intersection, stopping them in their tracks.

INT. DONNY'S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ted is still on the floor on the passenger's seat side. He looks around, and spots a "Club" underneath the seat. He glances at Donny, whose eyes are on the road. Ted grabs the club, and scrambles up the seat, taking a swing at Donny. Donny ducks out of the way, and tries to slap Ted away as Ted continues to takes swings at him. A few of them land, eventually drawing blood. Donny smacks Ted away. Ted tumbles back onto the passenger's seat. Then, with determination, he grabs the Club again, scurries in front of Donny, and locks the Club onto the steering wheel with a snap! Donny's eyes widen as Ted scrambles into the back seat. Donny tries to turn the wheel, but can't.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BOSTON CITY STREETS - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Donny's car swerves out of control, veering up the street, and crashing into a lamppost, fishtailing as it impacts. The airbags go off as the car comes to a stop. Taking advantage of the situation, Ted scrambles out the back window. He catches his fur on a jagged shard of glass, slightly ripping his side. He hangs and struggles for a bit, then drops to the ground. He sways a bit. TED'S POV - We see that his vision is swimming slightly. That little rip has done something... He shakes it off, and runs up the sidewalk. ANGLE ON DONNY, who scrambles out of the wrecked car, followed by Robert. They chase Ted up the street. Ted spots a garage with the door slightly open. He squeezes himself underneath, and disappears inside. ANGLE ON JOHN AND LORI - They screech to a stop behind Donny's car. They hurry out, just in time to see Donny and Robert duck underneath the door. They run up the sidewalk after them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UNDERGROUND AREA - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ted runs down a ramp, looking frantically around for an escape route. He darts off to the left, sprinting up a ramp, followed by Donny and Robert. Ted stops at a red metal fence, and squeezes through, rushing up the stairs on the other side. Donny reaches the fence, but with his larger size he has to climb over the top, which slows him down a bit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON JOHN AND LORI - We catch them ducking in through the garage door, and running inside. They look around for a beat. ANGLE ON ROBERT, who turns and sees them (Donny has already made it over the fence). ANGLE BACK ON JOHN.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ted runs out onto the upper level, and stops. The camera PIVOTS 180 DEGREES and ascends to reveal the expanse of FENWAY PARK down below. A few lights are on, and one lone maintenance man sweeps the dirt. Donny emerges from the stairwell, which snaps Ted out of it. Ted sprints past the front row of seats, and comes to a dead end. He has nowhere else to go. With Donny closing in, Ted scurries out onto the ledge, and pulls himself up onto the lighting tower. He looks down. From TED'S POV, it's a long drop. Donny reaches out to grab him, but can't quite reach. Donny glances down at the drop for a beat, then pulls himself out onto the ledge to go after Ted. Ted climbs farther up the tower.

John continues up the aisle as fast as he can move.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LIGHTING TOWER - CONTINUOUS Ted struggles to pull himself from Donny's grasp, but he can't. CLOSE UP ON TED'S SIDE - The small rip from earlier begins to tear again. CLOSE UP ON TED'S FACE - His eyes go wide, and for a moment, his face freezes with fear. TED'S POV - His vision swims a bit more. He knows this is not good...
</DIRECTION>

John reaches the top of the lower seating area, and sprints past the concession bar, heading for the stairs.

John runs past the top of the stairwell, and sprints over toward the lighting tower, just in time to see...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LIGHTING TOWER - CONTINUOUS Donny makes one final reach for Ted. He grabs Ted by the foot again, and pulls hard. With one great RRRIIIIIIP, Ted tears into two pieces. As John watches in shock, Ted falls through the air in SLO-MOTION, a shower of white stuffing descending with him. Lori watches with a hand over her mouth. The two halves of Ted land, along with the scattered white stuffing. Donny, still hanging, stares down at the fallen teddy bear. He starts pulling himself back over the ledge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We lead and follow John as he runs back down through the stadium with desperate numbness. Lori climbs over the edge of the seating area, and runs toward him as well. ANGLE BACK ON DONNY, who pulls himself back over into the upper seating area. He hears the sound of a cop siren, and peers over the edge of the stadium. Seeing a cop car pull up far below, he makes a break for it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Down below, Ted's top half lies on the grass, looking around in a daze, like a badly wounded soldier for whom there is not much hope. John and Lori race to his side, and kneel down.
