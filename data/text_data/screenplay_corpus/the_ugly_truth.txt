<LARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry to do this to you, Abby, but I don't think I can work with her anymore. It's bad enough I have to take her criticism at home. I can't do it on air, too. A man can only take so much.

(off his look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a newsman. A newsman isn't defined by the easy times, Larry, he's defined by the difficult ones. Can you imagine Ted Koppel or Chris Hansen or Anderson Cooper having their wives as co-anchor? Hell, no, because they couldn't handle it. But you can. You've got balls the size of Volkswagens. Don't think I haven't noticed.

	You know, they've done studies that show tap water is no different from bottled water. And they passed a law recently to have all restaurants filter their tap water. So, technically it's not tap water. It's filtered water, which is exactly what bottled water is, except you don't have to pay $7 for it.

No one falls in love with your personality at first sight, they fall in love with your tits and your ass. And they stick around because of what you're willing to do with them.

Abby, now infuriated, picks up the phone and begins dialing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE INTERCUT between the stage and her apartment, as Mike continues his rant.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Men don't fall in love. Men fall in "want." We want things. We're hunters and gatherers. We're the same as we were when we were cavemen and a gillion years of evolution hasn't done squat. Trust me, there was a Pamela Anderson of cave women and all the cave guys were trying to stick their dicks in her.

Mike walks over to a chalk board with the word "LOVE" on it. He crosses it out and writes "LUST."

</ABBY>
<MIKE>

	Did I burst your little Harlequin Romance bubble?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
Irritated, Abby begins to compulsively remake her bed.
</DIRECTION>
<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The only thing you burst is your credibility. Men are absolutely capable of experiencing love.

</MIKE>
<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?

</ABBY>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>

	Well, he's not like you, that's for sure.

	No, please. I'm loving this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He works out, not because he's vain, because it's healthy. He's socially liberal but fiscally conservative. He likes dogs but he's a cat person. He never gets out of bed before you on a Sunday morning --

</ABBY>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you're describing a woman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are those qualities so threatening to you? Perhaps because your complete lack of any one of them is the real reason why women aren't interested in you. At least women of quality.

Mike scoffs, but he's thrown. He takes a moment, then...

She rips the perfectly made bed apart and starts over.

<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am not ugly!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABBY>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, of course you don't think so. Ugly people never know they're ugly. It's like people who have B.O. They never know it because they're surrounded by their own stench all the time.

Now Abby's really fuming. She snaps a sheet violently.

<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, lemme help you out here. You might as well just face the fact that you're gonna be alone and stop pining away for some fantasy guy you're never going to get. Get a hobby. Build housing for the poor. Anything.

<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How could you possibly --

	<DIALOGUE>
	Well that about wraps it up for today. I'm Mike Alexander reminding you that the truth is never pretty.

<STUART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's got a point of view. We don't have to like him, we're news people. We're objective. Stone Phillips interviews terrorists, doesn't mean he likes them. It's good for ratings.

Abby holds up a piece of paper.

At this moment, MIKE walks in. Abby stares at him, appalled.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, and as you can tell by all the screaming rugrats in this town, Latino guys like to have a lot of sex. Which means they'd rather listen to me tell them how to bang hot chicks than hear about why they can't bring grandma across the border.

<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I knocked. I got no response.

</MIKE>
<ABBY>

	This is channel two. You do know that the lower numbers are better, right? More people watch. So don't tell me that "you and I" make good TV. I am an award-winning news producer. I make good TV. You make imbecilic trash watched by housebound inbreds who are so busy putting their hands down their pants they're unable to change the channel.

	I mean, come on Larry, I grew up watching you on TV. You used to be this cool confident cat. Georgia's no dumb bunny.

<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I agree. You've economically emasculated your husband to such a point that he's afraid to desire you. Sure, you can dump his ass, but honey, have you seen the eligible men in Albuquerque? It's slim pickings out there for a woman in her forties. You're not going to do any better than Larry. You just have to let him be a man. LET HIM BE A MAN, GEORGIA!

Mike faces the camera, finishing up his segment.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you want a woman to keep sleeping with you there are certain things you never say. For instance, "Hell no, I don't want to meet your family." Or "How hard is it to lose ten pounds?" "I have to take a dump, I'll call you back." And here's one that's sunk a lot of perfectly good sexual relationships: "Marriage? I'm just hanging out with you until I meet someone better." Guys, use your big head to help your little head. In other words, lie. And that's the ugly truth.

As they watch, Abby turns to Joy.

<ABBY>

As Abby shakes her head in disgust, a P.A. walks up and hands her a sheet of paper.

	Why do you hate my guts?

	You hate the truth?

	For your information, I happened to meet him last night.

</ABBY>
<MIKE>

	I really hope he's real this time, because otherwise this is just sad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, he's very real. Not to mention stunningly handsome and morally sound. His name's Colin. He's a doctor. An orthopedic surgeon, actually.

She moves to pick up the phone. Mike sits on the phone to stop her.

	Don't! He'll be expecting you to call him back. When you don't, he'll call you.

</MIKE>
<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABBY>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I know men. If you want it to work out with this guy, you'll listen to me and do exactly as I say. You already did irreparable damage with your psycho-aggressive control freak phone call. It might even be too late. Even if you do salvage the situation, you'll probably never be more than Abby, his desperate neighbor.

</MIKE>
<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When do I pick up?

</ABBY>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never. You make him wait until he gets frustrated and hangs up. If he's still holding on after thirty more seconds, you may actually have a chance.

<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'd better be right about this.
	</DIALOGUE>

	I don't want you to be a bimbo. You need to be two people, the saint and the sinner, the librarian and the stripper. It's a delicate balance. On one hand, you have to push the guy away with cold indifference and yet on the other hand be a sexually teasing tornado.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
Abby enters, looking amazing in a little black dress and sling backs. Her hair and make-up are sexy but not trashy.
</DIRECTION>
<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well just don't sit there. Say something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABBY>
<MIKE>

</ABBY>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You need glasses.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I wear contacts. Besides, doesn't the woman usually remove glasses during a makeover?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABBY>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but we're going for a stripper­librarian thing. Right now, I wouldn't trust you to find me a book.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
Abby opens a drawer and takes out some glasses. She puts them on.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not bad. Now we need to practice flirting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know how to flirt.

</ABBY>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you want to be an old maid?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, if I don't listen to you, I'll be an old maid?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABBY>
<MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
(acting old)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"My name's Abby and I'm arthritic and alone. I have eighteen cats who keep me company."

<ABBY>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, ha ha. That's very funny.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pretending to be Mike)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Are you wearing underwear?"
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABBY>
<DIRECTION>
She grabs his ass.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on! I wouldn't say that and I wouldn't grab ass.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<ABBY>
<DIRECTION>
(still as Mike)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Hey babe, what's wrong with a little ass grabbing?"
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing to pinch his ass)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"I mean what's the point of you even having one unless it's there for me to grab it? You're just a set of orifices and a pair of tee- tas."
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABBY>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a deeply, deeply disturbed person.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
Switching tactics, Abby slips into seductress mode, tracing her finger up and down his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe I'm just a good student.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABBY>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you stop doing that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doing what?

</ABBY>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Touching me with your finger.

</MIKE>

She seductively leans into him.
</DIRECTION>
<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why? Am I turning you on?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABBY>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
She gives him a look.
</DIRECTION>
<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, I kind of like it.

</ABBY>
<MIKE>

She leans in closer.

<ABBY>

	Sucker.

He shoves her away.

</ABBY>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Calm down. Keep the conversation under a minute. Be mysterious. Keep him guessing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
Mike leaps over the couch and hides. As Abby walks over to the door and opens it. Colin stands there.
</DIRECTION>
<ABBY>

</COLIN>
<ABBY>

<COLIN>

Mike pops up from under the couch. He gives her the thumbs up.
</DIRECTION>
<ABBY>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now what?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you want to go the Lobos game on Saturday?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLIN>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at Mike in amazement, then breaks into the happy dance. He watches, horrified at her spazziness.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell is that?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
As she continues to dork out, we CUT TO --

:SC:EXT. BALLPARK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ROAR of the crowd at the Lobos game.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Colin walks with Abby, who adjusts something in her ear. Now she's wearing the earpiece from the station, and on the other end...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MIKE'S POV THROUGH BINOCULARS -- A different angle of Abby walking down the aisle.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nod if you can hear me.

BINOCULARS POV -- Abby nods.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just relax. You're gonna be fine. I'll walk you through this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
Colin looks at Abby and smiles as they take their seats, popcorn in hand.
</DIRECTION>
<COLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you follow baseball?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLIN>
<DIRECTION>
We INTERCUT with Mike.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's no right answer to that question. Do something non- committal...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
Abby does something between a nod and shaking her head. Colin hooks at her, confused.
</DIRECTION>
<COLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm really more of a fair weather fan myself. I do like watching Mike DeLoggia pitch, though. Amazing bone structure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLIN>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Laugh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
Abby is baffled but proceeds to laugh awkwardly. Colin looks at her.
</DIRECTION>
<COLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's so funny?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLIN>
<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your joke.

</COLIN>
<MIKE>

</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
Feeling a popcorn kernel in her teeth, Abby takes out her floss.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait -- what the fuck are you doing? Is that floss?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
Abby freezes.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus! Put that away!

She puts the floss back in her purse.

Mike gestures for the fan to leave him alone as he continues to instruct Abby.

The fan throws peanuts at Mike. Mike turns around and shouts at the fan.

She points to the only nearby female -- an Elderly Obese Hot Dog Lady.

	Yeah. I was just trying to get us a hot dog.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLIN>
<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABBY>
<DIRECTION>
There's an awkward moment as Colin hands her the hot dog.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright, we need a recovery. Make sure to eat your hot dog slowly. Men like watching penis-shaped food go into a girl's mouth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABBY>
<DIRECTION>
Repulsed, she flinches, losing control of her drink, DUMPING it into Colin's lap. He flinches.

Unbeknownst to them, the batter hits a pop fly near them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE JUMBOTRON CAMERA follows the guy catching the fly, then finds Abby and Colin. PANS over to them and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It looks like Abby is giving Colin an enthusiastic HAND JOB.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ENTIRE STADIUM, ballplayers included, stop what they're doing and stare.
</DIRECTION>
<ABBY>

She smiles at Colin. As he looks nervously up at the JUMBOTRON.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Abby follows his gaze -- and sees SHE'S ON IT. Everyone at the stadium is looking at her. The organ player bangs out "Charge." The stadium starts WHOOPING and HOLLERING.

:SC:EXT. ZOO - DAY

<DIRECTION>
A cage of randy Bonobos getting it on. Mike, in a gorilla suit, does a segment. Next to him is an anthropologist, DR. LESTER.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of all primates, Bonobos are the closest relatives to human beings, both genetically and socially ­- especially when it comes to sex. For the Bonobo, sex is a way to ease stress and diffuse tensions.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_LESTER>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So summing up Bonobo-land, the chicks look great, get freaky in bed and in turn, they get to sit on their asses and boss their men around all day.

</MIKE>
<DR_LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's one way of looking at it.

<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How long do you think I should wait to sleep with him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABBY>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The more you make him beg for it, the more you've got him on the hook. Do everything but. Then show him beneath that control freak exterior, there's a sexual deviant waiting to be unleashed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am not a sexual deviant.
	</DIALOGUE>

</ABBY>
<MIKE>

</MIKE>
<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Trust me, I would never think about you while I'm flicking it. Not that I would ever do -- that.

<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just don't think of myself that way.

Abby checks herself out in the mirror. Now in the underwear. She downs a glass of wine, sits on the bed and picks up the remote. She turns it on. Nothing happens. She tries again. Nothing.

</MIKE>

UNDER THE TABLE

Abby tries to kick Mike. As she does, she unwittingly knocks over her purse. The contents spill out and the REMOTE for her vibrating underwear rolls away, stopping UNDER THE TABLE NEXT TO THEM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE NEXT TABLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A PRECOCIOUS KID, 8, sits with his parents. Bored out of his skull. When the remote rolls under his feet, the kid picks it up and flicks the switch. A small RED LIGHT turns on.

Stuart watches, worried, as Abby rises from underneath the table, clutching her head and looking around frantically, trying to figure out who has the remote.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE NEXT TABLE

The kid has flicked up the speed on the remote even higher.

Abby's eyes roll back. She looks like she's on three hits of ecstasy.

Candi looks at Harold, intrigued by Abby's display.

As Stuart frowns, concerned, Abby spasms, then rushes through it as fast as she can.

	So what's your number one piece of advice to all the people out there who are trying to find love?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAY>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't do it. Try to find lust instead. It's a lot easier and a lot less messy. Blue balls only last a few hours. A broken heart can last years.

</MIKE>

He hesitates, then looks at Abby for a moment. She gives him an encouraging nod. He gains confidence, and continues.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marriage starts off great. She's cute, you're cute, the world's cute. Nothing can burst your bubble of everlasting love. Then, ten years later, she's put on twenty pounds, you've got nose hair, you're voting for different presidents, and one day, the receptionist at Jiffy Lube accidentally grazes your hand as she hands you back your keys and you realize that's the first time a woman's touched you in three months. By year twenty, you've learned to completely tune out the sound of her voice and it occurs to you that ever since you walked down the aisle, you're living with someone who can barely tolerate your presence and, on the rare occasion that you actually do make love, she probably thinks about Jake Gyllenhaal.

	The big, strong, romantic men we've been reading about in novels and watching in movies since we were nine? They're fallacies. "Blue Lagoon" is a total freakin' lie. Men are not strong. Men are not brave. Men are afraid.

	Women would have us believe that they are the victims. They aren't. They want us to think that we break their hearts for sport. That's crap. They say they want romance. They say they want true love, but all they want is a checklist. Is he perfect? Is he handsome? Is he a doctor?

<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You men that fit the criteria -- don't kid yourselves. They're not sleeping with you. They're sleeping with a carefully calculated set of venal choices. Money over substance. Looks over soul. Polish over principles. No gesture, no matter how real or romantic, will ever compensate for a really impressive list of credentials.
