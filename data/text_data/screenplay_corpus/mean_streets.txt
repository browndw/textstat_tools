CHARLES CAPPA JR. (CHARLIE) is 25 of Sicilain origin. He was educated in Roman Catholic Parochial schools with one year and a half at a Jesuit college. CHARLIE was raised sternly in the Roman Catholic tradition but now has rejected many of the religion's tenets. He is very intelligent and has a sharp sense of humor. He is always well dressed. His favorite authors are Ernest Hemingway, Thomas Hardy, and Theodore Dreiser. He likes reading but enjoys films more. He is very fond of the New Testament and often exchanges quotes from it with his friend TONY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHARLIE has been dreaming. The dream frightened him. A TITLE APPEARS on the bottom of the frame: CHARLIE. He gets up to look at his face in the mirror. His room is lit by moonlight. It is a small tenement bedroom with a fire- escape outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He returns to bed and as his head hits the pillow, we hear the RONETTES singing "BE MY BABY."

INT. PARTY - HOME MOVIES - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Opening TITLES appear over 8mm. HOME MOVIES in which CHARLIE is shown along with his friends and family in a celebration...a sense of "one big unending party."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
During this opening segment WE SEE some of the characters that will later appear in the story: JOHNNY BOY, MICHAEL, TONY, TERESA, CHARLIE'S UNCLE GIOVANNI, and others. They are all Sicilian and are members of the same Italian- American neighborhood in New York City. (WE SENSE, from these HOME MOVIES, that the neighborhood forces its people to be strongly tied together in a way of life - Family, Church, Friendship.) These HOME MOVIES were taken during some formal and casual gatherings in which CHARLIE participated.

INT. BATHROOM IN A NEIGHBORHOOD BAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A longhaired "freak" is about to shoot-up. Suddenly the door opens and TONY (ANTHONY DEVENZIANO) comes in. TONY is totally different in appearance and dress from the "freak." He is 25, and a part time student studying liberal arts. His father is a very powerful racketeer in a different part of the city and owns several night club type discotheques and strip houses on the west side of town. One of these is operated by TONY - "TONY'S PLACE." CHARLIE is one of his closest friends. TONY is well dressed, flippant and reckless. He is a big drinker, liquor, wine, and even cough medicine.
</DIRECTION>
<TONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the fuck...hey!

TONY rushes over to the "freak", who is too strung out to defend himself, smashes the needle, and slaps him around.

EXT. WEST SIDE DOCKS - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The area is totally deserted except for two trucks parked side by side. Two men are tossing boxes from one truck to another and looking around furtively. MICHAEL stands nearby. MICHAEL LONGO is 26 years old. He lives in a different neighborhood but comes from the same type of background as CHARLIE and the others. He runs an illegitimate bar and dabbles in the yearly sale of firecrackers which he smuggles in from Maryland. He also deals in contraband cigarettes and runs a small-time "loan shark" business. He has a knack for business but he is otherwise unintelligent.

Michael crosses over to a '58 black Oldsmobile.

EXT. STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A deserted warehouse area in lower Manhattan. Prominent in the frame is a brightly painted red white and blue mailbox, contrasting with the drab hues of the neighborhood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOHNNY BOY walks down the street toward camera. JOHN CIVELLO (JOHNNY BOY) is 23 years old. He is an only child and lives with his mother, a divorcee. He is clean cut looking, yet slightly radical in dress. He was expelled from high school for vandalism and consequently spent several months in reform school. He is reckless, unambitious, nihilistic, and was classified a psychiatric 4- F. He is first cousin of TERESA RONCHALI who lives next door to CHARLIE. He has adopted TERESA'S family as his own and spends more time with them than he does with his mother.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOHNNY is carrying a package wrapped in plain brown paper under his arm, and he is smiling. He drops the package into the mailbox and keeps walking. But he is moving a little faster now and smiling a little more.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the mailbox explodes. Dozens of red, white and blue fragments shower down on the street. The impact of the blast knocks JOHNNY down. TITLE APPEARS on bottom of frame: JOHNNY BOY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is up in a moment. The CAMERA TRACKS with him as he starts running. WE SEE that he is grinning - quite literally - like crazy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHURCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE SEE CHARLIE full face. Behind him is a Confessional Booth. The church is very old, quiet, and dark. The CAMERA ZOOMS OUT to reveal rows of Holy Candles lit in the foreground. CHARLIE suddenly begins to speak softly and confidentially to an unseen entity that is OFF SCREEN.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONFESSION)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A...As you know, I've just come out of Confession. And as a penance they gave me ten 'Hail Marys' and ten 'Our Fathers'...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAMERA BEGINS TO TRUCK OUT. IT MOVES AROUND CHARLIE AND AWAY FROM THE HOLY CANDLES REVEALING CHARLIE'S PROFILE.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONTINUED)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Now, between you and me... You know how I feel about such things... 'Hail Marys'...'Our Fathers'...No imagination...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAMERA HAS NOW TRUCKED BEHIND CHARLIE AND WE SEE over his head he has been addressing a life sized statue of the crucified body of Christ, eyes closed reclining in his sepluchure.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONTINUING)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...If I'm going to do penance at all, I'll do it the way I think it would be done...by me, that is...according to my own trespasses. You know what I mean.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
This conversation of Confession will occur from time to time in other parts of the story as CHARLIE will periodically try very casually to justify his thoughts and actions to his "God." The images accompanying these monologues are to be of free association almost documentary in nature.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TONY'S PLACE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The club is dark and noisy and smokey when CHARLIE enters. He greets TONY who is sitting on a bar-stool. TONY directs CHARLIE to a corner of the club where the rest of the group is now getting boisterously drunk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHARLIE joins in, immediately taking on the mood of the group.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rest of the club is filled with many different types of customers: teenagers, adults pretending to be teenagers, sailors, male and female gays, and "the boys from the neighborhood." The music is loud and the lights are flashing but the strippers have not yet appeared.

1. CHARLIE and his friends dance and sing along with the music.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
2. CHARLIE picks up a billiard stick. He attempts to hit a filled shot glass towards TONY at the other end of the bar. He fails.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
3. CHARLIE tries to pull a tablecloth off of a stranger's table without moving the glasses or bottles. This also fails.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
4. A punch is thrown at someone. A lit cigarette in the puncher's fist creates a swift arc of light in the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
5. The Strippers finally appear on stage. CHARLIE becomes obsessed with the Negro stripper DIANE. He shouts to her, tosses things, and calls her names. She tries, half amusedly to ignore him but she can't.

Suddenly the light is turned on. TONY, CHARLIE, and JOHNNY BOY enter the room. The GIRL is startled and jumps up. JIMMY appears bewildered.

</TONY>
<DIRECTION>
The GIRL and JIMMY sit self-consciously as TONY goes to the medicine cabinet, takes out a few items and gives them to CHARLIE. TONY then crosses to the other side of the room where he removes the blanket which has been covering a large cage. He reveals a live, young beautiful PANTHER stalking to and fro.

The GIRL screams.

Everyone else except TONY, is backed up against the wall, frightened. The BOYS laugh nervously.
</DIRECTION>
<TONY>

The Italian song "Malafemina" (a tango-like rythmn) is heard coming from the juke-box. It is near closing time and there are only a few customers left in the club, including MICHAEL and two gays, BENTON and SAMMY, who is getting very drunk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHARLIE is at the corner table with TONY and JOHNNY BOY. CHARLIE is washing JOHNNY BOY'S face with cold water from a basin. Some of JOHNNY'S blood has mingled with the water.

<CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONTINUES)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For instance, the difference between me and you is this...you take that panther back there. I'd put him right up here above the bar...nice cage, you know? Nothing ordinary in my place. What good is it? You get robot customers. They come in, drink beer, go to the bathroom, and go home. No sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>

One of the BOYS more casual acquaintances is lying on the bar, drunk. He begins to sing along with the Italian music - but very badly.

The BOY slowly swings the door open and stares at the DRUNK leaning over the urinal, half asleep. He takes out his pistol and calmly shoots the DRUNK three times in the back.

CHARLIE lives in a typical lower east side tenement apartment. Each room is painted a different pastel color.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHARLIE is helping his mother pack a suitcase. Through out the scene he is addressing her but she is never seen on CAMERA. The CAMERA PANS following his movements and CHARLIE directs his conversation always towards but above and beyond it.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TERESA RONCHALI is 30 years, well built, attractive and intelligent. She is well read and quiet. The salary she makes as a secretary in a book publishing firm practically supports her family. She has epilepsy which has prevented her (in her own mind) from entering into any serious relationships with men. She has however, been having an affair with CHARLIE for the past year. It is a well kept secret from both families because the families regard each other as blood relations.

CHARLIE is dreaming this sequence. He and TERESA are both nude. She is lying face down on the bed. He approached and ejaculates prematurely - However, he doesn't ejaculate sperm - instead blood. They are shocked. The blood is on the bed, her legs, back, and his hands. Charlie cries out in pain.

	It doesn't make any sense. He wouldn't shoot him just because he insulted a racket guy...not unless it was personal.

</TERESA>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You missed the point. The kid's a climber...not very bright...but if you get down to his level to look at it his way; he kills a guy who insulted a big man - he gets a reputation. He thinks he's in good standing.

CHARLIE enters the bathroom to clean-up. He stares at his image in the mirror for a moment, then makes a face. He checks the whiteness of his teeth, pulls back his hair, and checks his complexion. The mirror image begins to speak. The CAMERA PANS BACK to CHARLIE'S FACE. His mouth is not moving.

INT. RESTAURANT - MID-DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHARLIE is sitting in a quiet corner of the restaurant. This restaurant was considered an above average business with quality and prices to match when it was first opened three years ago. The quality has diminished but the prices remain the same. As a result the place is dying. CHARLIE is scrutinizing the restaurant from his corner. He picks up a water goblet and critically examines the water spots on it. He calls a waitress to show her the dirt on the glass. She apologizes, cleans it with her apron, and places it back on the table. He takes a menu.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A chubby, middle-aged man, OSCAR, approaches the table. He is half owner of the decaying restaurant. He is in his shirt sleeves which, along with the side of his face, are smeared with grease and dirt. He is tired and disgusted.

CHARLIE is walking down the street on the lower east side. A noisy religious street festival is being held on the block.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SMALL ITALIAN CAFE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHARLIE enters a small Italian cafe and nods greetings to some of the people as he makes his way to the back of the room. This cafe is a strange hybred of coffee house, candy store, luncheonette, and meeting place for CHARLIE'S uncle GIOVANNI and his associates.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GIOVANNI De STEFANO is sixty. He is well respected and powerful both in and out of the neighborhood. He became a head figure not by being introduced formally as was the custom, but rather by fighting and killing his way into the organization. GIOVANNI is well dressed but not a stereotype of an old Mafioso, rather a kindly and intelligent old man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GIOVANNI converses intermittently in Italian.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A man is putting new records into the jukebox which is in the corner of the room in the luncheonette area.

	Thanks!

</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
CHARLIE walks through the luncheonette area, past the dining room where his uncle is in conference, to the bathroom at the very back of the cafe. MARIO is seated with his uncle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARIO is forty five years old. He is GIOVANNI'S closest associate, brought into the organization in the traditional manner, making his early reputation through hits (murders). He is not very intelligent but has an undying loyalty to GIOVANNI, and is very fond of CHARLIE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARIO and GIOVANNI are seated with a very old man. They are deep in their private conversation. CHARLIE passes by unnoticed and walks into the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHARLIE begins to wash his hands but changes his mind. He shuts off the faucet in order to eavesdrop on the conversation.

He's going to Miami? Good...keep him in Miami for six months...a year...a good long time. After everything's forgotten then I see what I can do for him. Right now...keep him away.

CHARLIE is seated at a table. The waitress, MARIE, approaches and gives him his cup of coffee... The following scene is reminiscent of a TELEVISION COMMERCIAL.

He pauses to sip the coffee, then shakes his head.

<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I'd say there are some Columbian coffee beans in this coffee, but only about 39%.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
MARIE is disinterested. CHARLIE continues.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see. You probably don't notice this Marie, but Colombian coffee beans are rich coffee beans. Bursting with that good, deep coffee flavor. Picked when they are ripe to the point of perfection. The beans of course, are protected by the tall South American Guama trees.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
MARIE chews her gum for a moment and leaves the table. CHARLIE'S monologue continues and gradually he falls back into his CONFESSION. As he talks, the CAMERA PICKS UP DETAILS of the cafe and the people in it.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then the bean pickers come down and pick each bean by hand. Bean by bean, all heavy with flavor. And they load them into boxes, one box at a time, box by box.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
From time to time CHARLIE is casually glancing at MARIE who is busy with her work.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLACK & WHITE & COLOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The images now move out of the cafe and the CAMERA REVEALS aspects of the neighborhood - LIVE ACTION and STILLS: stores, people, streets, buildings, in short; a concise vision of the neighborhood. All this is intercut with CHARLIE mentally stripping MARIE's clothes off with his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONTINUED)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like, looking at my uncle back there. One way is the obvious; ...man outside the law. On the other hand, instead of a breakdown of order there is a creation of order and instead of the breakdown of law, there is the creation of law...In this society which needs new law because 'What's a crowbar compared to a share of stock. What's the robbing of a bank compared to the founding of one and what's the murder of a man to the gainful employment of that man.' 'Do not think that I have come to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I have not come to destroy but to fulfill.' ...Amen.

Someone shoved a nude girl into the bathtub which is now filled with congealed red jello. The boys are laughing and shoving each other about roughly. CHARLIE comes out of the next room and walks along in a Christ like manner through the madness, his arms outstretched. One boy kneels and kisses the hem of his robe and CHARLIE blesses him. There is a great deal of pushing and shoving going on inside the bathroom and near the doorway. CHARLIE promises to save the sinner as he pushes his way through. He helps the girl remove the jello from her body and helps her out of the bathtub. It is obvious that she is quite stoned. She caresses him and they find themselves kissing.

JOHNNY BOY closes his eyes. CHARLIE looks at JOHNNY BOY and then looks at the cemetary in the moonlight. It seems totally apart from the city with the sirens and cars far in the distance.
</DIRECTION>

CHARLIE stands and unravels his robes, preparing to take them off. He projects the image of Christ delivering a sermon. Music and laughter in the distance catches his attention. The lights and the music are coming from the top floor of a tenement building where a Puerto Rican family is having a party. The sound echoes through the streets. Decorations are hanging and blowing away through the open windows. As CHARLIE watches a fight break out over one of the girls. Screams are heard. People run up and down the fire escape.

CHARLIE has pulled off the robe. He now removes the beard and wig and has become himself again. He leans over to find JOHNNY BOY fast asleep on a tomb.

INT. POLICE STATION - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Early morning. A door in the far corner of the room opens. CHARLIE is motioned through by a cop, who shuts the door immediately behind him. There is an unnaturally loud clanging sound that echoes in the room. CHARLIE looks around, still a little dazed, and spots MARIO standing over by the door. MARIO has made no move to greet him. He just stands there watching. CHARLIE walks over to him, sensing something a little ominous.

The TWA terminal at Kennedy. TONY'S car pulls up to the curb, CHARLIE gets out, waves away help from an idle porter, and pulls his suitcases out of the back seat. TONY leans across the seat toward him.

INT. TERMINAL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The place is huge and there is a lot of bustle and excitement. CHARLIE is noticeable because he is the only member of the crowd who walks slowly, without any apparent mission or destination. He makes his way toward the large flight board that looms over the whole room. Loudspeakers announce planes to and from every part of the world. On the flight board, the origins and destinations of the days flight spin and change every moment. He passes the insurance machines and almost stops - more upset than before. A businessman calmly pays for insurance. (Muzak is heard) CHARLIE continues on past a novelty shop where some plastic crosses and St. Christopher medals hang alongside the stuffed toy dogs and flight bags. He looks at the cross.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know what to say to you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
The ticket desk is under the flight board. CHARLIE eventually works his way over to the desk, drops his bag on the floor and stands staring at the board. He sees the names of dozens of cities flashing before him. As he watches, a pretty ticket clerk speaks to him from behind the desk.
</DIRECTION>
<CLERK>

	May I help you?

</DIRECTION>
<CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, may I help you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLERK>
<DIRECTION>
CHARLIE hears her this time. He reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out the ticket which he passes across to her. The clerk starts to open it to check the destination.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(questioning, challenging)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where can I go?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
The question is unusual. The clerk looks up. CHARLIE stare back at her with a quality that is almost defiance.
