During the chant, we PAN OFF, past two coal-bunkers (revealing that we are in the courtyard of a block of flats), and CLIMB the face of the tenement block to show an outdoor balcony with washing hanging out to dry.

A group of parents waits on the pavement outside the main entrance to the local school. Cars pass. The bell stops ringing as the children come out; one little girl waves and goes off in a direction different from her friends. It is ELSIE BECKMANN; she wears a satchel on her back and carries a string bag with a ball in it. When she comes to cross the road she steps off the curb without looking, a car HONKS at her and she hurriedly steps back onto the curb. A policeman stops the traffic and escorts her across.

10,000 Marks Reward. WHO IS THE MURDERER? Since Monday, 11th June this year, the following have disappeared: the school-children Klaus Klawitsky and his sister Klara, who live at 470 Mueller Street. Various evidence leads us to believe that the children were victims of a similar crime to that committed last autumn against the Doering sisters.

He steps forward. Several policeman follow him.
</DIRECTION>
<LOHMANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Spread out ... spread out all of you. All of you ... spread out. Come on, come on now. Get your papers out.
	</DIALOGUE>

More detectives come down the stairs.

<A_VOICE>

(o.s., begging)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me go, please, Inspector.
	</DIALOGUE>
</A_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
One of the criminals hides at the back of the CLOAKROOM. He tries to get out through a skylight, but suddenly starts back. Through the grille of the skylight which gives onto the street, he sees: a policeman stands outside. The thief resignedly turns away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the ladies' TOILET, a policeman enters, hesitates, then pulls back a curtain. A thief, embarrassed, comes out of his hiding place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the MAIN CELLAR, LOHMANN and two of his men are installed behind two tables. In front of him stands a young prostitute. Uniformed police form a corridor leading to the exit. In the background, the various occupants of the club stand about.
</DIRECTION>
<LOHMANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you got any papers?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOHMANN>
<THE_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But, Inspector, I can't go around everywhere with my date of my birth on me. That's asking too much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_GIRL>
<LOHMANN>
<DIRECTION>
(indifferent)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's not beat around the bush, darling.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOHMANN>
<DIRECTION>
Between LOHMANN and one of his assistants, THE GIRL stands beside an enormous THUG, with a black eye, wearing a cap, a fag-end in his mouth, hands in pockets. A row of police lines the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
(indignantly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's really asking too much, Inspector.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_GIRL>
<LOHMANN>
<DIRECTION>
(severely)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alex.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOHMANN>
<DIRECTION>
Alex is short for Alexanderplatz, the headquarters of the Berlin police. In other words, she's going downtown.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look here, it's disgusting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
She goes off to the right. Pushed by the others, the THUG steps forward. He takes out a wallet and, very sure of himself, hands his papers to LOHMANN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOHMANN flicks through the papers. Skeptically, he examines their owner. A policeman searches the THUG. LOHMANN whistles the song: 'Where did you get your beautiful blue eyes?' and gives the THUG an understanding wink. Behind them stand a group of thieves, surrounded by police. The policeman finishes searching and goes out. The THUG puts his hands back in his pockets and looks at LOHMANN triumphantly. LOHMANN smiles and holds the papers up to the light.
</DIRECTION>
<LOHMANN>
<DIRECTION>
(commiserating)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Poor workmanship, my friend...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOHMANN>
<DIRECTION>
The THUG, surprised, takes the cigarette butt out of his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<LOHMANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've been had.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOHMANN>
<DIRECTION>
A pause. LOHMANN signals to a policeman.
</DIRECTION>
<LOHMANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alex. Next.

The THUG furiously throws his butt to the floor.

	Next.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOHMANN>
<DIRECTION>
A greasy Mediterranean type steps forward, very smooth. He wears a sumptuous fur-collared overcoat. Taking off his bowler, he tips his hat to LOHMANN obsequiously and presents his papers.
</DIRECTION>
<ANOTHER_THIEF>

(admiringly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fancy boy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANOTHER_THIEF>
<DIRECTION>
Another whistles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOHMANN looks at the papers and gives them back. FANCY BOY raises his hat again and prepares to leave. We TRACK with him. Suddenly LOHMANN, using the handle of his walking stick, snags FANCY BOY's arm and pulls him back to the table.
</DIRECTION>
<FANCY_BOY>
<DIRECTION>
(astonished)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the matter?

</A_THIEF>
<SEVERAL_VOICES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's got him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEVERAL_VOICES>
<DIRECTION>
LOHMANN grabs a newspaper jutting out of the pocket of FANCY BOY'S fur coat, unfolds it, and looks it over:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT - the front page of the newspaper dated 21st November, 1930. An illustrated article, circled in pencil, reads: 'Unsolved burglary at a furrier's shop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOHMANN puts down the paper.
</DIRECTION>
<LOHMANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well ... I think I had better take you down to headquarters.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOHMANN>
<FANCY_BOY>
<DIRECTION>
(horrified)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But, after all, my ... my papers are in order.

</FANCY_BOY>

While he protests, his papers are taken from him.

Next in line is a LITTLE FAT MAN, cheerful and very friendly.

The LITTLE FAT MAN comes up to LOHMANN and clumsily takes off his hat.

<LOHMANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Next ... come on, let's keep it going.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOHMANN>
<DIRECTION>
Two policemen search a corner of the room. They look under the tables, tip up the chairs and go through the pockets of the coats in the cloakroom. One finds a revolver, then a leather briefcase. INSERT of the briefcase as it is opened: inside, a complete housebreaking kit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Things that have been confiscated are piled up, a jimmy, a saw, revolver bullets, etc. A hand adds the empty briefcase to the pile. The LANDLADY stands behind her bar talking to a SERGEANT, who takes out a cigarette.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDLADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is ruining our business, Sergeant ... Every night there's interference. No one can have ten minutes in peace anymore. Give us a chance!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDLADY>
<DIRECTION>
She goes to the back of the bar and pours herself a drink. The SERGEANT lights his cigarette at a gas lamp.
</DIRECTION>
<SERGEANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's no joke for us either, out every night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERGEANT>
<LANDLADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course ... but you're drivin' away my clientele ... And the guy you're looking for isn't here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she drinks)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't imagine how mad everyone is about this guy who's causing a raid every night. Especially the girls ... okay, they walk the streets ... but, believe me, every one is a a little mother at heart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDLADY>
<DIRECTION>
The SERGEANT tries to keep a straight face as he leans on the bar, surrounded by clouds of cigarette smoke.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDLADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know plenty of crooks who get kinda tender when they see kids playing. If they catch that bastard ...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(makes a short, sharp gesture)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... they'll wring his neck. Believe me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDLADY>
<DIRECTION>
Another policeman comes up and salutes the SERGEANT.
</DIRECTION>
<POLICEMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ready to go, Sergeant?
	</DIALOGUE>
</POLICEMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The SERGEANT touches the peak of his cap and leaves with the policeman.
</DIRECTION>
<SERGEANT>
<DIRECTION>
(to the LANDLADY)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERGEANT>
<DIRECTION>
The LANDLADY watches them leave with a gesture of disgust.

<DIRECTION>
INT. THE UNDERWORLD MEETING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A man in plus-fours stands by the window of a comfortably furnished middle- class room; he looks at the street through binoculars. He is a PICK-POCKET. In the street, two police vans drive past, full of crooks. LOHMANN follows in an open car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The PICK-POCKET still looks through his binoculars.
</DIRECTION>
<PICK_POCKET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, it's 'The Crocodile' tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(lowers the binoculars)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two trucks full again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PICK_POCKET>
<DIRECTION>
He turns around. On the sofa, smoking a cigarette, sits a tall, thin CON-MAN, dressed impeccably but a little pretentiously. He wears a dark jacket, a waistcoat and light trousers, and has a thin moustache. Lounging beside him, a BURGLAR, tough but not very bright, also smoking. The CON-MAN gets up impatiently.
</DIRECTION>
<CON_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's keeping Schraenker?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CON_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
A moustached SAFE-BREAKER sits at the table in the center of the room, doctoring playing cards.
</DIRECTION>
<SAFE_BREAKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Isn't it three o'clock yet?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAFE_BREAKER>
<PICK_POCKET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll find out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PICK_POCKET>
<DIRECTION>
He puts down the binoculars and walks from the window to the telephone in the middle of the room. He dials a number.
</DIRECTION>
<PICK_POCKET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello ... The exact time, please, Miss.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(sits at the table)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two minutes to three. Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PICK_POCKET>
<DIRECTION>
He hangs up and, from various pockets, takes out a series of watches. He compares the time they show and places them on the table. The CON-MAN has sat down beside him and does card tricks.
</DIRECTION>
<PICK_POCKET>
<DIRECTION>
(setting one of the watches)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two minutes to three.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PICK_POCKET>
<CON_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
(disgusted)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are more police on the streets than whores.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CON_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
The BURGLAR sits in an armchair, a bag under his arm. In front of him, a small low table, with an ashtray on it overflowing with butts.
</DIRECTION>
<BURGLAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wherever you spit ... nothing but cops.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURGLAR>
<DIRECTION>
The SAFE-BREAKER, chewing on his cigarette holder, comes up to the table. He wears a white waistcoat and a white bow-tie. A 1900-style chandelier hangs above everyone.
</DIRECTION>
<PICK_POCKET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Even when you're with a doll, they don't leave you in peace ... And they've gone nuts too ... All they can think about is that murderer ...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to the SAFE-BREAKER)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Mine ... she's got a little six-year old girl, and, every night, I have to waste time searching under the bed and in the cupboards to make sure the murderer isn't hiding there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PICK_POCKET>
<DIRECTION>
The CON-MAN spreads three cards out on the table. The SAFE-BREAKER indicates a card with the look of an expert. The CON-MAN turns it up: an ace. The PICK- POCKET takes out a handkerchief and spreads it out beside the watches.
</DIRECTION>
<PICK_POCKET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't even get on with your job. Everywhere you come across the police. There's no privacy any more ... I'm fed up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PICK_POCKET>
<DIRECTION>
The SAFE-BREAKER walks around the table, looking at the time as he passes.
</DIRECTION>
<CON_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
(bored)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What else is new?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CON_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
He puts the cards in his pocket. The PICK-POCKET arranges his watches in the handkerchief and slips them into his pocket. The SAFE-BREAKER sits down again.
</DIRECTION>
<CON_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's keeping Schraenker?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CON_MAN>
<PICK_POCKET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe he's been caught.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PICK_POCKET>
<BURGLAR>
<DIRECTION>
(laughing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not him.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(rejoins the others)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He did a bank job in London and Scotland Yard set a trap for him ... there he was, hands up, back to the wall, millions of cops all round ... and two seconds later there were two bodies on the ground and he'd beat it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURGLAR>
<DIRECTION>
The BURGLAR has sat down, his bag on his knee. The SAFE-BREAKER lights another cigarette from the stub of the first.
</DIRECTION>
<SAFE_BREAKER>
<DIRECTION>
(with respect)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The best man between Berlin and San Francisco.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAFE_BREAKER>
<BURGLAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They've been looking for him for six years and they haven't caught him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURGLAR>
<PICK_POCKET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Haven't caught him ... But dogs can kill wolves.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PICK_POCKET>
<SAFE_BREAKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAFE_BREAKER>
<DIRECTION>
The PICK-POCKET tries to calm the SAFE-BREAKER. They are all nervous and worried, and smoke heavily. The CON-MAN looks at the time again.
</DIRECTION>
<CON_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The suspense is killing. He's usually right on time--
	</DIALOGUE>
</CON_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
On these last words, the door bell RINGS four times. Relieved, they look at one another.
</DIRECTION>
<PICK_POCKET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank God!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PICK_POCKET>
<BURGLAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At last!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURGLAR>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens. SCHRAENKER appears in leather overcoat, bowler hat and carrying a walking stick. He immediately shuts the door, but doesn't come into the room.
</DIRECTION>
<ALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good afternoon ... You've got here at last. Good afternoon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALL>
<SCHRAENKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you mad? Close the curtains.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHRAENKER>
<DIRECTION>
At the window, the curtains are half-drawn. Next to it is the table where the SAFE-BREAKER is sitting. The PICK-POCKET creeps along the wall to the window to avoid being seen from the street. The PICK-POCKET returns to his place at the table in the middle of the room. SCHRAENKER, at the central table, has taken off his overcoat to reveal a chalk-stripe suit, dark tie and black leather gloves. He removes his hat, putting it on the table with his curved-handled walking stick (very similar to Lohmann's).
</DIRECTION>
<SCHRAENKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gentlemen, the meeting can now begin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHRAENKER>
<DIRECTION>
He sits down to preside over the meeting.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHRAENKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	According to the regulations, I confirm with pleasure that the leadership of every organization in our Union is represented.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHRAENKER>
<DIRECTION>
He grasps his stick.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHRAENKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I assume that you all have full powers ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHRAENKER>
<DIRECTION>
The SAFE-BREAKER nods. The PICK-POCKET, who is cracking a nut, nods too. The CON-MAN, while lighting a cigarette, also nods. Finally, the BURGLAR, still bent over the bag, also gives his assent.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHRAENKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... authorizing you to vote for your members. Good ... let's not be held up by procedure. We all know why we are here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(vehemently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Someone who is not a member of the Union is threatening our rackets. The new measures taken by the police, the daily raids in our areas to find this child murderer, interfere with our business activities in an unbearable way. We can put up no longer with the endless pressure from the police, in every hotel, cafe, or flat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHRAENKER>
<SAFE_BREAKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's for sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAFE_BREAKER>
<PICK_POCKET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mm hmm!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PICK_POCKET>
<SCHRAENKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This state of affairs must not be allowed to continue. We'll have to put things right again or we'll be destroyed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHRAENKER>
<DIRECTION>
The BURGLAR stubs out his cigarette. As SCHRAENKER continues to talk, the BURGLAR takes out another cigarette and strikes a match. Now and again SCHRAENKER'S gloved hand, playing with his stick, passes across frame.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHRAENKER>
<DIRECTION>
(o.s.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The funds of our organization are exhausted. Unless I make use of the funds put aside to support the wives of our colleagues who are being looked after by the state, I just don't know where I'll find the funds needed for the preparation and execution of our various projects. What is more, our reputation is suffering. The cops are looking for the murderer in our ranks, gentlemen ... When I come up against a cop while carrying on my business, he knows the risk he runs ... and I do, as well. If one of us dies ... okay ... that's a risk one must take. It can happen: but we are not on the same level as this man they're looking for now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHRAENKER>
<DIRECTION>
SCHRAENKER underlines these last words with a wide gesture.
</DIRECTION>
<SAFE_BREAKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exactly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAFE_BREAKER>
<SCHRAENKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is a chasm between him and us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHRAENKER>
<BURGLAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURGLAR>
<PICK_POCKET>
<DIRECTION>
(at the same time)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No comparison.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PICK_POCKET>
<SCHRAENKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're doing our job because we have a living to make. But this monster has no right to live. He must DIS - APP - EAR. He must be exterminated, without pity ... without scruples. Gentlemen, our members must be able to carry on their business normally, without being handicapped by the growing nervousness of the police. I'm appealing to you ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHRAENKER>
<DIRECTION>
With a gesture, he invites comments; on the gesture, we CUT TO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE OFFICE OF THE CHIEF OF POLICE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CHIEF continues SCHRAENKER'S same gesture. A meeting is also in progress at his office. Policemen and high-ranking detective inspectors are sitting at a long conference table, littered with brandy glasses and coffee cups. Cigar-smoke fills the air. The CHIEF stands at the head of the table and finishes SCHRAENKER'S line:
</DIRECTION>
<CHIEF_OF_POLICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... for advice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHIEF_OF_POLICE>
<DIRECTION>
He sits down and a police OFFICER rises. Beside him, a bespectacled man in plainclothes listens attentively.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
(in a military tone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I suggest a closer watch on I.D. cards, a systematic search of the the whole city, police raids...
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
The bespectacled man looks dubious.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... more numerous raids, and certainly tougher ones.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
He sits down. We now CUT BACK AND FORTH between the meetings of the police and the underworld.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE UNDERWORLD MEETING...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...the CON-MAN gets up.
</DIRECTION>
<CON_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Spies ... We need spies in the ranks of the police to give us plenty of warning of new measures.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CON_MAN>
<BURGLAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The girls've got to take a little more notice of the cops. We're always getting into trouble because one of the girls has snitched to her cop boyfriend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURGLAR>
<DIRECTION>
The PICK-POCKET agrees; the CON-MAN sits down satisfied.
</DIRECTION>
<BURGLAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, it's up to the girls to snitch for us!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURGLAR>
<DIRECTION>
The SAFE-BREAKER rises.
</DIRECTION>
<SAFE_BREAKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What we must do ... And after all, we've all got contacts ... What we must do is make a statement to the Press ourselves, tell them that we, the Organization, members of the Union -- we condemn the bastard just as much! We ought to make it known that the police should quit looking for him in the underworld.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAFE_BREAKER>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE POLICE MEETING...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... an elderly bespectacled detective, with a small beard and a stiff collar, speaks. Another detective sits on his right; on his left, a police officer with a monocle.
</DIRECTION>
<ELDERLY_DETECTIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sure it's a man who looks like a peaceful little family man, who wouldn't harm a fly, except when he has his fits, of course!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELDERLY_DETECTIVE>
<DIRECTION>
LOHMANN listens with interest.
</DIRECTION>
<ELDERLY_DETECTIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps in his normal state, he even plays marbles with the concierge's children.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELDERLY_DETECTIVE>
<DIRECTION>
LOHMANN nods agreement.
</DIRECTION>
<ELDERLY_DETECTIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or perhaps plays cards with his wife. Without this appearance of, let's say inoffensiveness in private life, it would be impossible to believe that murderers like Grossmann or Haarmann were able to live for years in large, busy blocks of flats without their neighbors suspecting them in the slightest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELDERLY_DETECTIVE>
<DIRECTION>
An OFFICER with a moustache, smoking a pipe, agrees; beside him a plain- clothes man takes notes.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what we must get across to the public. They must help.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
LOHMANN, clearly annoyed, rises to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<LOHMANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't talk to me about help from the general public. It disgusts me just to hear them talk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOHMANN>
<DIRECTION>
He bows towards the CHIEF OF POLICE.
</DIRECTION>
<LOHMANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, Chief ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOHMANN>
<DIRECTION>
The CHIEF, smiling, makes a gesture accepting the apology.
</DIRECTION>
<LOHMANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, but that is the truth. Good God! Has help from the public brought us one useful clue?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOHMANN>
<DIRECTION>
Furiously, he stubs out his cigar.
</DIRECTION>
<LOHMANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a pile of letters full of the most incredible accusations!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOHMANN>

An assorted collection of second-hand goods and junk is on display. A line of metal grilles form a cash desk, and there are violins and accordions spread out on a long table. In the background there are several barrel organs, and on a shelf a stack of old shoes and boots. A constant murmur of voices reaches us from other parts of the market. The junk dealer demonstrates one of the barrel organs to a beggar, but it is very out of key and only plays a few screeching NOTES.

The BLIND BEGGAR -- the one who sold the doll-like balloon to the MURDERER -- sits at a nearby table drinking a beer, balloons floating above him. Putting down his glass, he covers his ears to blot out the screeching. Immediately, the excruciating noise from the barrel organ stops; but as he lowers his hands, it starts up again. After a moment, another organ starts to play a charming polka. The BLIND BEGGAR lowers his hands and is delighted. He begins to conduct an imaginary orchestra. The music continues over as we

We TRACK with them, past a poster advertising 'West-front 1918'. The man goes with the little girl as far as the entrance to a SCHOOL. He kisses her and leaves here there. Beside the school entrance, another BEGGAR, with two white pigeons, is on the look-out.

A fruit-seller's barrow, piled high with apples, oranges and bananas. From a strut hang some superb pineapples. The MURDERER stands behind the barrow dolefully eating an apple, at the same time gesturing to the fruit-seller to put another in the bag being filled for him.

HIGH ANGLE - the ASSISTANT finishes his inspection. Disappointed by the negative search, he slowly replaces the cloth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLES - the ASSISTANT beside the table. Above his head, hangs a Tiffany- style glass lampshade, and beyond him a large pottery stove stands against the wall. As the ASSISTANT carefully surveys the room, we PAN across from the bedside table to the double windows. A bowl of fruit and other foodstuffs are stored in the space between them. We recognize the same wide windowseat where the MURDERER wrote his letter to the press. We PAN back to the ASSISTANT again. He leans over a wicker waste-paper basket from which he extracts an empty cigarette packet, a publicity hand-out for cigars and a postcard, which he lifts up and studies carefully.

EXT. STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MURDERER eats an apple and looks at a window display in a cutlery and silverware shop. We see him from inside through the glass, his face framed in the reflection of a diamond-shaped display of knives. The reflections of other cutlery form geometric patterns around him. We see the street behind him and his VIEW of the shop window: the knives are arranged around a diamond-shaped mirror on the screen at the back of the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MURDERER munches his apple. Suddenly he stops chewing. Reflected in the mirror he can see a little girl leaning against the railings on the other side of the street, the image framed with knives. The MURDERER stands transfixed, staring at her. He wipes his mouth with the back of his hand, eyes bulging. The little girl leans nonchalantly on the railings, obviously waiting for someone. The MURDERER'S arms fall limply to his side, he gasps for breath and his eyes close as he sways forward against the shop front. Then the fit subsides and he recovers slightly. Seen in reflection, the little girl leaves the railings and goes out of sight. The MURDERER slowly turns around and follows her with his eyes. He lowers his head and sets off slowly, whistling the 'Peer Gynt' theme.

A bookshop window, in which hangs a spinning cardboard circle with an endlessly spiral design near a huge cardboard arrow bobbing quickly up and down. The little girl stares fascinated by the continual motion, until she turns away distracted by something else. Just as the 'Peer Gynt' theme begins to accompany her -- WHISTLED piercingly by the MURDERER o.s. -- the girl wanders on past other shop windows and delightedly flings her arms around a smart young woman who approaches her.

The whistling stops abruptly.

The woman and the little girl walk off, arms around each other. We FOLLOW them along the pavement as they pass the MURDERER who has ducked into the bookshop doorway, pretending to look at some books displayed there. He looks around furtively and eventually steps out into the street to watch them go, his eyes drooping and his mouth partly open. Behind him the arrow continues to fly up and down, its shadow appearing to pierce the revolving spiral at every descent, as if stabbing at the MURDERER's heart. He puts his hands together on his chest, nervously scratching them. The MURDERER turns to see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A NEARBY CAFe...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...with tables outside, screened from the street by a trellis of climbing plants. The MURDERER enters and sits at a table to the left of the entrance, his face just visible in profile through the foliage. A WAITER comes out to serve him even though the cafe's not open yet.

The MURDERER swallows the second glass, leans forward and stares fixedly in front of him. With a mechanical gesture he puts a cigarette in his mouth and immediately takes it out again. He presses his two bunched fists into his eyes and starts to whistle again. Then he covers his ears. In the background the lights of the cafe come on and faintly light up the table. He immediately stops whistling and gets up. We TRACK away from him rapidly.

HENRY hides in a corner of the roadworks between a tar boiler and a great roll of cable. He watches the street.

The MURDERER and the LITTLE GIRL come out of the shop. She curtsies and offers him the bag of fruit. He takes an orange. Anxiously, he looks right and left, but there is no one in sight. Then he sweeps back his coat and puts his hand into his trouser pocket.

ANGLE ON the MURDERER, facing the girl. He finishes peeling his orange and throws the peel onto the ground. HENRY walks up, quickly but casually. As though by mistake, he knocks against the MURDERER and so gets a chance to slam his left hand against the back of the MURDERER'S left shoulder. Terrified, the MURDERER backs away, dropping the knife.

Uncertain, he moves first one way and then the other, before finally deciding to turn down a side street. We PAN WITH him to reveal a man standing nearby, pressed tensely against the wall of a building, watching the MURDERER. Is he one of the beggars? Or just an innocent bystander? They regard one another for a long, agonizing moment. Nervously, the MURDERER hesitates a moment, is about to tip his hat to him, but then walks off briskly. The man watches the MURDERER depart, then, after a long moment, begins to follow him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIGH ANGLE - the MURDERER in an empty street, trying to shake off his pursuers. He turns sharp left and crosses the road, but at the far end two beggars appear. The MURDERER retraces his steps and stops undecided in front of the covered entrance GATE to a huge block of offices. In the foreground, a pursuer blocks the middle of the street.

GATEWAY - The gate, a geometrical structure, leads to the inner courtyard of an office building. We TRACK rapidly with him as the MURDERER frantically runs in and hides behind a buttress. Anxiously, he watches the gateway.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDE ANGLE - From the street we see the gateway where the MURDERER, a tiny figure, hides behind a pillar. Two fire engines ROAR past, sirens BLARING and lights flashing -- and blocking the remaining beggar's view. By the time the fire engines have passed, the MURDERER has disappeared. The FIRST BEGGAR quickly crosses the road and goes through the gateway arch, searching vainly for the MURDERER. The two other BEGGARS return and join him in the courtyard.

</WATCHMAN>

In the foreground, various compartments, all filled with a jumble of old furniture and bric-a-brac, cut off from the passage by fence-like partitions. The WATCHMAN passes behind them. We TRACK WITH him past several compartments.
</DIRECTION>
<WATCHMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyone there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATCHMAN>
<DIRECTION>
He checks one of the doors by shaking it to see whether it is firmly closed. He goes to the next one, where he does the same.

NEW ANGLE - In the gloom of the attic, we can just make out the MURDERER, hiding in a corner. We hear the disappearing FOOTSTEPS of the WATCHMAN and the rattle of doors.

EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - GATEWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The gateway of the office block. From the street outside, we can see through the sliding gates across the courtyard to the lighted windows of the WATCHMEN'S OFFICE. Somewhere a clock STRIKES eleven, as a uniformed policeman walks up to the gates and stops. He RINGS the bell. One of the watchmen comes out into the courtyard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WATCHMAN'S POV reveals the empty street through the gates and the policeman saluting behind them.
</DIRECTION>
<POLICEMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>

REVERSE SHOT - THE POLICEMAN - who turns out to be SCHRAENKER in disguise. He points two revolvers.

(a pause; then, brutally)
</DIRECTION>

The WATCHMAN slides back the gate. SCHRAENKER goes through and with the barrel of one of his guns pushes the WATCHMAN towards his office. The gate stays open.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHRAENKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get a move on!

</SCHRAENKER>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON THE GATE - which has been pushed open just wide enough to let one person through at a time. The key ring swaying from the key in the lock of the gate. O.s. SCHRAENKER whistles a few bars of the song, 'Be faithful and honest.' Someone else echoes his whistling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SAFE-BREAKER appears and signals to a group of colleagues to follow him. They pass through the gate, loaded with bags and suitcases. They all gather in front of ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE WATCHMEN'S OFFICE. Over the heads of the whole group, through the glass partition and half-open door, we see the WATCHMAN sitting terrified on a chair with SCHRAENKER and the CON-MAN standing over him.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHRAENKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How many other watchmen are there in the building?

	Okay, then. Okay.

<DIRECTION>
He shuts the door from the inside. Through the glass panes of the door, we see SCHRAENKER saying something to the WATCHMAN who still refuses to reply. At a sign from SCHRAENKER, the CON-MAN reaches over the seated WATCHMAN'S shoulders and pulls back the WATCHMAN'S arms. The crowd of crooks press forward to watch the torture through the glass, thus partially blocking our view. After a second's silence, there is a sharp SCREAM. SCHRAENKER opens the door and speaks to the crooks standing outside.

He examines the lock from underneath. On his back the chalked letter M is still visible.

HUGE CLOSE-UP - he slips the blade of his knife between the lock and the door, trying to pry open the catch, but the blade snaps and the point falls to the ground.

<DIRECTION>
CLOSE - he flattens one end of the nail with the handle of his knife.

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR, the PICK-POCKET creeps nearer to the door, listening carefully. The BANGING continues. Wildly excited, he makes for the stairs; but he suddenly remembers the time-switch and turns back on his heels and quickly resets it. He pauses for a second to listen again, and then rushes downstairs.

The SAFE-BREAKER who leans over the hole in the floor, shining his torch to light up the room below. Hearing the shouting, he jumps up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He emerges into the HALLWAY and grabs at the PICK-POCKET as he passes.

TOP FLOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE ATTIC, the MURDERER has succeeded in bending the nail and tries to use it as a skeleton key. He puts it into the key-hole and feels around with it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE HALLWAY, the metallic sound of the nail inside the keyhole can still be heard, as SCHRAENKER and the others arrive. They stop to listen and the men nudge one another expectantly.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHRAENKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shhhhhh ... keep quiet!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHRAENKER>
<DIRECTION>
The noise of the HAMMERING can be heard clearly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE ATTIC, the MURDERER, crouched behind the door, HAMMERS at the nail. On the floor, he studies his crude skeleton key. He turns back to the door and is about to push the key into the keyhole when the handle moves very slightly. The MURDERER backs away and presses himself against the wall, eyes bulging with terror and staring fixedly at the door-handle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE HALLWAY - CLOSE - THE LOCK - Two hands are testing a skeleton key selected from an assorted bunch on a large key ring.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE ATTIC, the MURDERER presses his ear against the door to listen and then slips off down the corridor. Halfway down, he turns back to switch off the light, plunging the place into darkness except for the illumination filtering in around the edges of the door. His shadow disappears into the recesses of the attic. A moment later, the door bursts open and SCHRAENKER appears in silhouette against the hallway light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind him three flashlights click on.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHRAENKER>

He CRASHES against the door with all his weight to break it open.

IN ONE OF THE COMPARTMENTS, the MURDERER hides, weak with fear. Light feebly penetrates a skylight behind him. The sound of doors being forced open comes gradually closer.

The BURGLAR sits by INSPECTOR GROEBER'S desk. A lamp shines into his face. GROEBER is a distinguished, well-groomed man of about fifty. Behind them sits a secretary, a little old man who looks over the top of his spectacles at the BURGLAR with mild surprise and then over to GROEBER. GROEBER cuts a cigar and, from behind the lamp, leans towards the BURGLAR.

On these last words, he lets himself fall forward, while the BURGLAR puts out the match and lays the cigarette on the table, feigning surprise.
</DIRECTION>
<BURGLAR>

	I don't understand, Inspector. A man, you said? No, I don't know anything about that, Inspector. There must be some mistake. I don't know anything. Nothing at all.

GROEBER relights his cigar.

<GROEBER>

	Funny friends! Leaving you right in it and running off. Bah!

	That won't wash with me, Inspector.

He raises his eyes to the WATCHMAN.

He reads from the dossier.

INT. LOHMANN'S OFFICE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOHMANN sits at his desk smoking a cigar, framed against the large map of the city on the wall behind him. Now he is in shirt-sleeves, his collar open and tie loosened, and he looks tired and harassed. He is on the telephone, and with one hand pours out coffee from an enamel coffee pot.

LOHMANN'S mouth drops open in amazement, and his cigar falls out onto the table. A pause. Dumbfounded, LOHMANN, without thinking, raises a shaky hand to remove the cigar from his lips. He looks confused for a moment, but quickly recovers his composure and picks it up from the dossier where it had fallen.

<DIRECTION>
Assorted members of the underworld stare at him. We PAN ALONG the entire length of the cellar to reveal that a vast crowd has assembled -- crooks and their wives, whores, pimps, and beggars -- most of them standing, with the older members seated on boxes and crates. There is absolute silence and no one moves. PAN continues until it reaches a trestle table set up in front of them. Behind it sit the PICK-POCKET, the CON-MAN and the SAFE-BREAKER, on either side of SCHRAENKER -- obviously a crude form of tribunal and, as usual, SCHRAENKER is in charge.

He backs away, terrified by the balloon, until he stumbles against the table. The MURDERER'S voice grows more and more high-pitched:
</DIRECTION>
<MURDERER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no, no ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURDERER>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLES - The MURDERER, near the table.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHRAENKER>
<DIRECTION>
(o.s.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where did you ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHRAENKER>
<DIRECTION>
On SCHRAENKER'S first words, the MURDERER turns to a threatening SCHRAENKER who has a photograph in front of him on the table of a little girl.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHRAENKER>
<DIRECTION>
(leaning forward ominously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... bury little Martha?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHRAENKER>
<DIRECTION>
Behind the MURDERER, we see the BLIND BEGGAR and the staircase guarded by the two men. As one of the men leads the BLIND BEGGAR away, the MURDERER walks toward SCHRAENKER, pleading.
</DIRECTION>
<MURDERER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But ... but I never ... I never even knew her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURDERER>
<SCHRAENKER>
<DIRECTION>
(sarcastically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yes, very good. You didn't even know her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHRAENKER>
<DIRECTION>
SCHRAENKER waves another photograph.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHRAENKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what about this one?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHRAENKER>
<DIRECTION>
The MURDERER backs away, now helpless with fright.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHRAENKER>
<DIRECTION>
(o.s.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And this one?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHRAENKER>
<DIRECTION>
The MURDERER chews at his fingers. SCHRAENKER'S gloved hand shows a third photograph. We recognize ELSIE'S face.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHRAENKER>
<DIRECTION>
(o.s.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... and this one, you didn't know this one either, eh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHRAENKER>
<DIRECTION>
The MURDERER is now crazy with fright. Panic-stricken, he spins around in a mad dash for the exit. One of the men who brought him in sits at the foot of the stairs; he jumps up to bar the way as the crowd begin to jump up and SHOUT hysterically.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop him ... Stop him ... don't let him escape!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICES>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd surges forward. Only SCHRAENKER remains calmly seated.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop him ... he can't get away!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICES>
<DIRECTION>
The MURDERER rushes the crook on the stairs, pushing him violently out of the way, and then climbs desperately towards the iron door.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quick, stop him ... Hold him ... Look out ... the door!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICES>
<DIRECTION>
At the top of the stairs, the MURDERER tries to open the door but a crook grabs him by the collar.
</DIRECTION>
<A_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold him ... hang onto him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</A_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The MURDERER hangs onto the door handle with both hands. The crook holds him from behind. Two others come to his aid.
</DIRECTION>
<A_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go on ... Go on . .. Hit him ... Belt him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</A_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE - the MURDERER'S convulsed face. A hand seizes him by the throat.
</DIRECTION>
<MURDERER>
<DIRECTION>
(in a strangled voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me go ... Let me go!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(almost in tears)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have no right to treat me like this!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURDERER>
<VOICES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll show you what right we have!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICES>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER - The three men try to make the MURDERER loosen his grip. A fourth crook comes up the stairs to help them. One of them kicks him on the shins. The general shouting gets louder as more people crowd on the steps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE - The crook kicks the MURDERER. The MURDERER'S hand still grasps the iron door's handle.
</DIRECTION>
<A_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go on ... on his shins.
	</DIALOGUE>
</A_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE - The MURDERER receives another violent kick in the shins.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER - the struggle at the door. A crook tries to hit the MURDERER'S hands.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Heave ... ho. Heave ... ho.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICES>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE - the crook's fist violently striking the MURDERER'S fingers. The shock makes him let go.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER - the group draws back from the MURDERER and throws him down the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MURDERER falls heavily to the ground, banging his head sharply against some old timbers lying against a wooden barrier. He lies twisting with pain while the crowd CHEERS and HOOTS triumphantly.
</DIRECTION>
<MURDERER>
<DIRECTION>
(groaning)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have no right to hold me here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURDERER>
<DIRECTION>
A prostitute gets up furiously.
</DIRECTION>
<PROSTITUTE>
<DIRECTION>
(screaming fanatically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right? Someone like you doesn't have any rights!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(roaring)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kill him!

</PROSTITUTE>
<A_MAN>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, kill him!

</A_MAN>
<PROSTITUTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Crush him like a mad dog!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROSTITUTE>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd grows very animated.
</DIRECTION>
<A_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Crush him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</A_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
SCHRAENKER turns impatiently to the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHRAENKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quiet!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHRAENKER>
<A_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kill him! ... Kill him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</A_VOICE>
<SCHRAENKER>
<DIRECTION>
(shouts)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHRAENKER>
<DIRECTION>
An imperious gesture from SCHRAENKER and the crowd calms down. When the noise dies down completely, he turns towards the MURDERER.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHRAENKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You talk of rights ... You will get your rights.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHRAENKER>
<DIRECTION>
PAN ACROSS the attentive faces of the crowd, as SCHRAENKER continues:
</DIRECTION>
<SCHRAENKER>
<DIRECTION>
(o.s.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We are all law experts here, from six weeks in Tegel, to fifteen years in Brandenburg...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHRAENKER>
<DIRECTION>
SCHRAENKER gestures to the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHRAENKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You will get your rights ... you will even have a lawyer.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(ironically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everything will be done according to the rule of law.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHRAENKER>
<DIRECTION>
The MURDERER crouches against the wooden barrier like a toad.
</DIRECTION>
<MURDERER>
<DIRECTION>
(screaming)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A lawyer? ... A lawyer! ... I don't need a lawyer ... Who is accusing me? You, maybe? You?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURDERER>
<DIRECTION>
A hand reaches down and taps him on the shoulder. The MURDERER turns around. A fairly old, ill-shaven man leans towards him across a wooden barrier. He is the LAWYER. In front of him, on a chest, a pile of Criminal and Civil law books.
</DIRECTION>
<LAWYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eh ... just a moment ... If I were you, sir, I'd keep quiet. Your life's at stake ... in case you didn't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAWYER>
<DIRECTION>
The MURDERER rises and leans towards the LAWYER seated behind his chest. He stares at him in amazement.
</DIRECTION>
<MURDERER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And who are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURDERER>
<LAWYER>
<DIRECTION>
(greets him with a wave of his hat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have the dubious honor of being your defense counsel. But I am afraid it won't be much use to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAWYER>
<DIRECTION>
The LAWYER superciliously blows some dust from his notebook.
</DIRECTION>
<MURDERER>
<DIRECTION>
(to the LAWYER)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But ... but... do you want to kill me then?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(horrified)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Murder me, just like that!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURDERER>
<SCHRAENKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We just want to render you harmless. That's what we want ... but you'll only be harmless when you're dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHRAENKER>
<MURDERER>
<DIRECTION>
(begging)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But, if you kill me, it'll be cold-blooded murder!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURDERER>
<DIRECTION>
Derisive LAUGHTER echoes around the cellar. The LAWYER sighs and shakes his head sadly.
</DIRECTION>
<MURDERER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I demand that you hand me over to the police.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURDERER>
<DIRECTION>
The LAUGHTER increases. The MURDERER raises his voice.
</DIRECTION>
<MURDERER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I demand to be handed over to the jurisdiction of the common law!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURDERER>
<DIRECTION>
Loud LAUGHTER from the crowd. SCHRAENKER and the CON-MAN watch, unconcerned; behind them, the crowd rocks with LAUGHTER.
</DIRECTION>
<A_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quite a performance ... That's not bad, that, ha, ha, ha!
	</DIALOGUE>
</A_VOICE>
<SCHRAENKER>
<DIRECTION>
(to the MURDERER)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That would suit you, wouldn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHRAENKER>
<CON_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
(ironic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anything else you'd like?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CON_MAN>
<SCHRAENKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So that you can invoke paragraph fifty-one...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHRAENKER>
<A_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</A_VOICE>
<SCHRAENKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... And spend the rest of your life in an institution at the state's expense ... And then you'd escape ... or else there'd be a pardon and there you are, free as air, with a pass, protected by the law because of mental illness. Off again chasing little girls.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHRAENKER>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd LAUGHS.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHRAENKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no. Very dry. We're not going to let that happen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHRAENKER>
<A_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(echoing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no, no.
	</DIALOGUE>
</A_VOICE>
<SCHRAENKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We must make you powerless. You must disappear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHRAENKER>
<A_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bravo ... he must disappear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</A_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The MURDERER sobs with fear.
</DIRECTION>
<MURDERER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But -- I can't help what I do!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURDERER>
<DIRECTION>
He falls to his knees and miserably hides his face in his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<MURDERER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't help it ... I can't ... I can't ... I can't help it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURDERER>
<DIRECTION>
In the front row of the crowd, a crook rises to his feet and waves dismissively.
</DIRECTION>
<CROOK>
<DIRECTION>
(with contempt)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The old story.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROOK>
<DIRECTION>
A long pause as the MURDERER, on his knees, helplessly lowers his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<MURDERER>
<DIRECTION>
(in complete despair)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you know about it? What are you saying? If it comes to that, who are you? What right have you to speak?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURDERER>
<DIRECTION>
He turns his head to look at them all.
</DIRECTION>
<MURDERER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who are you? ... All of you? ... Criminals! Perhaps you're even proud of yourselves? Proud of being able to break safes, to climb into buildings or cheat at cards ... Things you could just as well keep your fingers off ... You wouldn't need to do all that if you had learnt a proper trade . .. or if you worked. If you weren't a bunch of lazy bastards ... But I ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURDERER>
<DIRECTION>
His hands clutch at his chest.
</DIRECTION>
<MURDERER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't help myself! I haven't any control over this evil thing that's inside me -- the fire, the voices, the torment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURDERER>
<DIRECTION>
A skeptical SCHRAENKER sits at the table; behind him the crowd listens intently.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHRAENKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean to say you have to murder?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHRAENKER>
<MURDERER>
<DIRECTION>
(agonized)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Always... always, there's this evil force inside me ... It's there all the time, driving me out to wander through the streets ... following me ... silently, but I can feel it there... it's me, pursuing myself, because ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURDERER>
<DIRECTION>
An old man in the crowd nods thoughtfully, moved by the MURDERER'S genuine anguish.
</DIRECTION>
<MURDERER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to escape ... to escape from myself!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURDERER>
<DIRECTION>
Two other crooks. One of them seems very moved.
</DIRECTION>
<MURDERER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... but it's impossible. I can't. I can't escape.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(panting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to obey it. I have to run ... run ... streets ... endless streets. I want to escape. I want to get away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURDERER>
<DIRECTION>
Two prostitutes, one of them nervously twisting a handkerchief.
</DIRECTION>
<MURDERER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I am pursued by ghosts. Ghosts of mothers. And of those children ... They never leave me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(shouts desperately)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They are there, there, always, always! Always ... except ... !
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(lowers his voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... except when I do it ... when I ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURDERER>
<DIRECTION>
He raises his hands towards his neck, as though he were about to strangle a victim, then he lets them fall limp at his sides. He shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<MURDERER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then I can't remember anything ... And afterwards I see those posters and I read what I've done ... I read ... and ... and read ... Did I do that? But I can't remember anything about it ... But who will believe me? Who knows what it feels like to be me? How I'm forced to act ... How I must ... Don't want to, but must ... Must ... Don't want to ... must. And then ... a voice screams ... I can't bear to hear it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURDERER>
<DIRECTION>
He puts his head against the wooden barrier in a paroxysm, covering his ears with his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<MURDERER>
<DIRECTION>
(at the height of his fit)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't ... I can't go on. Can't go on ... Can't go on ... Can't go on ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURDERER>
<DIRECTION>
SCHRAENKER and the SAFE-BREAKER sit, the crowd behind them. SCHRAENKER rises to his feet as the MURDERER'S voice dies away.
</DIRECTION>
<MURDERER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't go on ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURDERER>
<SCHRAENKER>
<DIRECTION>
(to the crowd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The accused has said that he cannot help himself. That is to say: he has to murder. As this is the case, he has pronounced his own death sentence.

<VOICES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hurrah ... that's true ... Hurrah.

</A_VOICE>
<SCHRAENKER>
<DIRECTION>
(louder)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This man must be wiped out, eliminated.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHRAENKER>
<DIRECTION>
APPLAUSE and SHOUTS. The MURDERER, on his knees, rubs his head against the barrier, his hands still over his ears. The NOISE continues. Behind SCHRAENKER and the SAFE-BREAKER, the crowd is in a frenzy.
</DIRECTION>
<VARIOUS_VOICES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hurrah ... Perfect, just what I think ... Hurrah!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VARIOUS_VOICES>
<DIRECTION>
The LAWYER gets up. Beside him, the MURDERER cringes.
</DIRECTION>
<LAWYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wish to speak.

</LAWYER>
<SCHRAENKER>
<DIRECTION>
(o.s.)

	<DIALOGUE>
	The defense lawyer will speak.

</SCHRAENKER>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd quiets down.
</DIRECTION>
<LAWYER>
<DIRECTION>
(ironically, off SCHRAENKER)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our very honorable President who is, I believe, wanted by the police for three murders ...

</LAWYER>
<SCHRAENKER>
<DIRECTION>
(very angry)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's got nothing to do with it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHRAENKER>
<LAWYER>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... claims that because my client acts under an irresistible impulse, he is condemned to death.

</LAWYER>
<A_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's exactly it ... Yes... He's right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</A_VOICE>
<LAWYER>
<DIRECTION>
(shakes his head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He is mistaken ... because it is that very fact that clears my client.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAWYER>
<DIRECTION>
Members of the crowd look puzzled: a one-eyed crook, a prostitute, an older man who looks like a wrestler.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_ONE_EYED_CROOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, just a moment, that's enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_ONE_EYED_CROOK>
<DIRECTION>
Other faces in the crowd look on sternly. In the foreground sits a crook with a moustache, a hat and a bow-tie.
</DIRECTION>
<CROOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you mad, you drunken old sot?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROOK>
<LAWYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is this very fact of obsession which makes my client not responsible ... And nobody can be punished for something which he is not responsible for.

</LAWYER>
<DIRECTION>
WHISTLES and CAT-CALLS.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's ridiculous.

</VOICE>
<PROSTITUTE>
<DIRECTION>
(furious, jumps to her feet)

<A_CROOK>
<DIRECTION>
(bitterly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That he should stay alive?
	</DIALOGUE>
</A_CROOK>
<LAWYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean that this man is sick. And a sick man should be handed over, not to the executioner, but to the doctor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAWYER>
<SAFE_BREAKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could you guarantee he'd be cured?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAFE_BREAKER>
<LAWYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What use are asylums, then?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAWYER>
<CON_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what would happen if he escaped?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CON_MAN>
<SCHRAENKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes ... or if they released him as harmless? And what if the compulsion to kill returns? Yet another man-hunt for several months. Paragraph fifty-one again. Into the asylum again and then another escape or release. And then the compulsion all over again. And so on and so on till doomsday!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHRAENKER>
<LAWYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No one has the right to kill a man who is not responsible for his actions. Not the state, and certainly not you. The state must take care that this man becomes harmless and ceases to be a danger to his fellow citizens.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAWYER>
<DIRECTION>
During this plea, the crowd becomes excited and they begin to SHOUT and BAWL at the top of their voices. His last words are almost lost in the general LAUGHTER. A PROSTITUTE gets up.
</DIRECTION>
<PROSTITUTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've never had children, eh? So you haven't lost any either. But if you want to know what it's like to lose one of your kids ...

</PROSTITUTE>
<DIRECTION>
Another woman tries to calm her.
</DIRECTION>
<PROSTITUTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... then go and ask the parents of those children he got at.

</PROSTITUTE>
<DIRECTION>
Amid the different groups of onlookers, an enormous thug listens, close to tears.

<PROSTITUTE>

	Ask them what those days and nights were like when they didn't know for sure what was up ... and about the ones when they finally knew what happened.
