</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA is at floor level. A young man enters but we see only his shoes and the cuffs of his pants. We TRACK with him as he walks across the room and stops at a record player. Pause. We HEAR a record drop and begin playing a light classical melody. The SUPERIMPOSED TITLES BEGIN. After a moment the feet move off and we TRACK with them, past a low table, and around a couch to the window curtains. The feet pause there for a moment. A piece of heavy window cord drops INTO FRAME. We FOLLOW as it is dragged along to the low table. Then the feet move over to a large ornate desk. The cord is pulled up OUT OF FRAME. Pause. The feet walk over to a chair by the wall. It is picked up, carried to the center of the room, and carefully placed. Pause. The feet get up onto the chair and the CAMERA RISES to their level. They shuffle about for a moment. At an appropriate musical break the CREDITS STOP. Suddenly the feet knock over the chair and drop into space. They kick about for a bit, then go slack and still. The FINAL CREDITS are SUPERED OVER the suspended appendages while the music comes to a lilting conclusion. As we HEAR the record player turn itself off, the CAMERA BEGINS a half circle tour around the hanging feet and stops at the heels. Pause. Outside we HEAR a woman's footsteps approaching and we change focus as the door to the den opens. Through the blurred hanging feet we see a tall, middle-aged, fashionably dressed woman enter and we PAN with her as she walks to the desk. This is MRS. CHASEN. She seems rather tired and preoccupied as she begins to remove her long white gloves. Slowly the CAMERA BEGINS a vertical rise up the side of the hanging corpse until we are watching Mrs. Chasen over his left shoulder. The rope and his stretched neck frame the right side of the SCREEN. We hold. Mrs. Chasen puts down her gloves and looks up. (NOTE: THE ABOVE IS ALL ONE CONTINUOUS SHOT.)

	Needless to say, the first time it happened I was absolutely abashed. I was so shook I needed three tranquilizers to calm me down. Well, you can imagine. Suicide notes all over the house - "Goodbye," "Farewell," "Arrivederci." Other children pretend to run away from home, but Harold - he's so dramatic.

<MRS_CHASEN>

	Of course, Harold's father had a similar sense of the absurd. I remember once in Paris he stepped out for cigarettes and the next I hear he's arrested for floating nude down the Seine - experimenting in river currents with a pair of yellow rubber water wings. Well, that cost quite a little bit of "enfluence" and "d'argent" to hush up, I can tell you. Harold, dear, stop playing with your food. Don't you feel well?

Mrs. Chasen sitting before her vanity table, humming to herself as she readies herself for bed. She wears a night- gown, a cover for her hair, and she has just finished putting on several different face creams. She gets up, walks over to the bathroom, and opens the door. Blood is everywhere -- on the walls, the floor, the mirror - and in the tub is Harold, his throat slit and his wrists dripping blood onto the razor on the tile floor. The effect is one of instant shock. Mrs. Chasen screams and backs up in horror. Sobbing hysterically, she clutches her robe about her and rushes from the room crying.

<DIRECTION>
Harold is sitting in a chair. His mother enters and sits down at the desk.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_CHASEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have here, Harold, the forms sent out by the National Computer Dating Service. It seems to me that as you do not get along with the daughters of my friends this is the best way for you to find a prospective wife.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_CHASEN>
<DIRECTION>
Harold starts to say something.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_CHASEN>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, Harold, we have a lot to do and I have to be at the hairdresser's at three.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she looks over the papers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Computer Dating Service offers you at least three dates on the initial investment. They screen out the fat and ugly so it is obviously a firm of high standards. I'm sure they can find you at least one girl who is compatible. Now first, here is the personality interview which you are to fill out and return. There are fifty questions with five possible responses to check... "A - Absolutely Yes, B - Yes, C - Not sure, D - No, E - Absolutely No." Are you ready, Harold?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_CHASEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The first question is "Are you uncomfortable meeting new people?" Well, I think that's a "yes." Don't you agree, Harold? Even an "Absolutely yes." We'll put down "A" on that. Now, number two. "Do you believe it is acceptable for women to initiate dates with men?" Well, absolutely. Mark "A" on that. "Three - Should sex education be taught outside the home?" I would say no, wouldn't you, Harold? Give a "D" there.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Chasen continues filling out Harold's questionnaire without hardly ever even looking over for his reaction. He sits there, watching.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_CHASEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Four - Do you often invite friends to your home?" Now, you never do, Harold. Absolutely no. "Five - Do you enjoy participating in clubs and social organizations?" You don't, do you? Absolutely no. "Six - Do you enjoy spending a lot of time by yourself?" Absolutely yes. Mark "A." "Seven - Should women run for President of the United States?" I don't see why not. Absolutely yes. "Eight - Do you have ups and downs without obvious reason?" You do, don't you, Harold? Absolutely yes. "Nine - Do you remember jokes and take pleasure in relating them to others?" You don't, do you, Harold? Absolutely no. "Ten - Do you often get the feeling that perhaps life isn't worth living?" Hmm. What do you think, Harold?
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Harold looks blankly back at his mother.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_CHASEN>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"A"? "B"? We'll put down "C" - "Not sure." "Eleven - Is the subject of sex being over-exploited by our mass media?" That would have to be "Yes," wouldn't it? "Twelve - Do you think judges favor some lawyers?" Yes, I suppose they do. "Thirteen - ....

</MRS_CHASEN>
<DIRECTION>
Harold sits passively in his chair. Slowly he draws a revolver from his pocket. As his mother rattles on he very deliberately loads the bullets one by one into the chamber.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_CHASEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Is it difficult for you to accept criticism?" Nooo. We'll mark "D." "Fourteen - Do you sometimes have headaches or back aches after a difficult day?" Yes, I do indeed. "Fifteen - Do you go to sleep easily?" I'd say so. "Sixteen - Do you believe in capital punishment for murder?" Oh, yes. "Seventeen - Do you believe churches have a strong influence to upgrade the general morality?" - yes, again. "Eighteen - In your opinion are social affairs usually a waste of time?" Heavens, no! "Nineteen - Can God influence our lives?" Yes. Absolutely yes. "Twenty - Have you ever crossed the street to avoid meeting someone?" Well, I'm sure you have, haven't you, Harold? "Twenty-one - Would you prefer to be with a group of people rather than alone?" That's you, Harold. "Twenty-two - Is it acceptable for a schoolteacher to smoke or drink in public?" Well, with reservation. Mark "B." "Twenty-three..."
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_CHASEN>
<DIRECTION>
Having finished loading the gun, Harold cocks it and, looking at his mother, slowly lifts it up.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_CHASEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Does your personal religion or philosophy include a life after death?" Oh, yes, indeed. That's "Absolutely." "Twenty-four - Did you enjoy life when you were a child?" Oh, yes. You were a wonderful baby, Harold. "Twenty- five..."
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_CHASEN>
<DIRECTION>
The gun is pointing at his mother. Slowly Harold turns it till it is pointing directly into his face. He pulls the trigger. A burst of blood and a loud EXPLOSION.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He and the chair are blown over backward OUT OF FRAME. SOUNDS of crashing furniture and breaking china. Mrs. Chasen remains impervious to it all.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_CHASEN>

	... "Do you think the sexual revolution has gone too far?" It certainly seems to have. "Twenty- six...

	Psst! Psst!

Harold looks up. Maude gives him a friendly wink, and a kind of "How do you do?" smile. Harold is horrified. The priest looks up from his praying. It is the same priest as before. He looks over at Maude. Maude suddenly over- come by sorrow backs away from the people.

	Thank you. But when you take these cars don't you think you are wronging the owners?

</HAROLD>
<MAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What owners, Harold? We don't own anything. It's a transitory world. We come on the earth with nothing, and we go out with nothing, so isn't "ownership" a little absurd?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Still, I think you'd upset people and I'm not sure that's right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAROLD>
<MAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, if some people are upset because they feel they have a hold on some things, then I'm merely acting as a gentle reminder - I'm sort of breaking it easy -- Here today, gone tomorrow, so don't get attached to things. Now, with that in mind, I'm not against collecting stuff...

We see Maude's main room filled with all kinds of eccentric memorabilia, from a mounted swordfish to an ivory Buddha. It is dominated by a large canopied bed like something from a Wagnerian opera. Other features are a large fireplace, a baby grand piano, expensive paintings on the walls, a tall wooden sculpture, and a Japanese type eating area with satin cushions.

We come to a silver serving dish with a large silver cover over it. A hand comes into frame and removes the cover. On the dish is Harold's severed head. The hands pick up the head. We TILT UP and see it is Harold. He takes the dummy head over to his dresser, combs the hair and picks off the latex blood, and then takes it to the center of the room, where a headless dummy sits in a chair. Harold screws the head onto the dummy. It doesn't fit very well. He fiddles with it a moment but he is not satisfied. He goes to his closet and looks into a box of tools and things. He takes a meat cleaver out but he is still looking for something else. There is a knock on the door and Mrs. Chasen in evening clothes enters.

Harold hears the door shut. He ponders his fate for a moment. He leans around the door and looks at the dummy. He thinks. He gives it up. He goes back in the closet to find whatever he was looking for.

Candy and Mrs. Chasen look out the French window. They wave. Harold waves back and leaves. Candy and Mrs. Chasen sit down. Candy faces the window; Mrs. Chasen has her back to it.
</DIRECTION>
<CANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He seems very nice. Is Harold interested in, eh, what's going on? I think it's such a super thing to study. And then, of course, I can always fall back on home ec.

	Yes, that's good planning. Tell me, are you a regular, Candy, in this computer club?

We see out the window that Harold has come back. He carries a large can marked Kerosene. Candy sees him but returns her attention to answering Mrs. Chasen.
</DIRECTION>
<CANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Heavens no. I don't have to worry about dates. You see, the other girls in my sorority, well, we decided that somebody should try it, so we drew straws and I lost.

She looks beyond Mrs. Chasen, out the window. She is a little nonplussed. Harold is pouring the kerosene all over himself.

	Oh, yes? Well, that's all right. I've got a brother who's a real cut-up, too. I'll never forget the time we had this old TV set with no parts in it. Well, Tommy stuck his head behind it and started giving a newscast before the whole family. We were all hysterical. And here's little Tommy pretending to be Walter Cronkite.

She looks back at Harold out the window. He is ablaze. Her mouth falls open.

<HAROLD>

	Maude. Maude. Anybody home?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAROLD>
<DIRECTION>
He gets no answer and steps into the room. He looks over the fireplace, where a furled umbrella is hung up like a rifle. Nearby he sees a glass cabinet full of sea shells and glass work. He walks over to a large table and is puzzled by the odd-shaped, machine-like boxes on top. He looks over at the wood sculpture, a highly polished work with very smooth curves and holes. Instinctively he puts out his hand to touch it, but decides he shouldn't. He walks over to the piano and examines the silver frames standing on it. They have no photographs in them and this interests him. He goes to the window. Over his shoulder we see MADAME AROUET hoeing in her vegetable patch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. THE BACK YARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MEDIUM SHOT of Madame Arouet. She is dressed in the black peasant's dress of Southern France. She is thin and wrinkled and wears a large straw sun hat. She is con- tinually working. Harold comes up to her.

CLOSEUP - MADAME AROUET

She looks up from her work and watches Harold. There is a strange sadness in her old weathered face - time lost, pleasures past over, the resignation to a lifetime of work. She turns back to her garden.

HAROLD'S POV - AN ARTIST'S STUDIO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The first thing we notice is the large block of ice in the center of the room - seven to eight feet tall - and through it, as if looking through the glass on a shower door, we can see a naked female body posing as Venus. The sculptor, GLAUCUS, a frail, little, white-haired old man, dressed in winter clothing, turns from the ice with a chisel and hammer in his gloved hand.
</DIRECTION>
<GLAUCUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you want?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLAUCUS>
<HAROLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. I was looking for Maude.

The nude figure behind the ice moves and we see her head over the top. It is Maude.

	Do you often model for Glaucus?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAROLD>
<MAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Heavens no! I don't have the time. But I like to keep in practice and poor Glaucus occasionally needs his memory refreshed as to the contours of the female form.

	Oh, I'm so happy you said that because I wanted to show you my paintings. This is the "Rape of Rome" and, of course, there in the corner is quite a graphic depiction of Leda and the Swan.

<MAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you have to touch it.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have to run your hands over it, get close to it, really reach out and feel. You try it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
Harold tries. He gingerly moves his hand over a rather sensuous curve.
</DIRECTION>
<MAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right. How's the sensation?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
A low RISING WHISTLE is heard.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go ahead, Harold. Stroke, palm, caress, explore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
Harold watches Maude leave the room. He hears her invita- tion and looks at the sculpture. A battle is going on inside him. ("Go ahead touch it! - Better not!") Maude begins humming in the kitchen. She won't be out for a while. Harold begins moving his hand over the polished wood. His face is expressionless, but he moves his body closer and his hand becomes more daring. He brings his other hand onto the sculpture. He is enjoying the sensations. He looks at the large hole before him. His hand moves around it. ("Go ahead - Better not!") His eyes scan the room. Suddenly he sticks his head in the hole, pulls it out, steps back quickly, and looks over to the kitchen. Maude is still out there humming. Harold relaxes, straightens his suit, looks at the sculpture, and braves a short smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maude enters with the tea.
</DIRECTION>
<MAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here we are, Harold. Oat straw tea and ginger pie.

<HAROLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Certainly a new experience for me.

	Of course, there's no doubt the body is giving out. I'm well into autumn. I'll have to be giving it all up after Saturday. Sweeten the tea with honey, Harold. It's delicious.

You see, Harold, they're like the Japanese. At first you think they all look alike, but after you get to know them you see there is not a repeat in the bunch. Each person is different, never existed before and never to exist again. Just like this daisy -

<DIRECTION>
They come to a little tree growing in the garden.
</DIRECTION>
<MAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at it, Harold. It's suffocating. It's the smog. People can live with it, but it gives trees asthma. They can't breathe. See the leaves are all brown. Harold, we've got to do something about this life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAUDE>
<HAROLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But what?
	</DIALOGUE>

<MAUDE>

Maude and Harold walk off to the car in front. The officer turns off the radio. He looks up. Maude has opened the door of the car in front with her ring of keys. She waves to him.

<DIRECTION>
Maude and Harold enter. The block of ice in the center of the room is now five to six feet tall and melting rapidly into the large trough in which it stands. Around the studio on the walls and benches are every conceivable hand tool - sculpting tools, gardening tools, construction tools, etc. On a raised platform in one corner covered with rugs and cushions and skins, lies Glaucus, bundled up in a parka and snoring horribly. In his gloved hands he holds a hammer and an ice pick.

	Oh, my. We're too late.

</HAROLD>
<MAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	An ice sculpture. It's Venus - the Goddess of Love, the completion of which is his unfulfilled dream.

</MAUDE>
<HAROLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is kind of rough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAROLD>
<MAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's never finished one yet. He has around him every kind of hand tool known to man, but the poor dear has difficulty staying awake.

Harold and Maude sit before the fire. They have just finished dinner.

<MAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A little after-dinner liqueur, Harold?

</MAUDE>
<HAROLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I really don't drink...

	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAROLD>
<MAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
(offering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some nuts? Some licorice? It has no nutritional value but then consistency is not really a human trait.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAUDE>
<HAROLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.

He chews the licorice. He gestures above the fireplace.

<HAROLD>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAROLD>
<MAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My umbrella?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(fluttery laugh)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, that's just a relic. I found it when I was packing to come to America. It used to be my defense on picket lines and rallies and political meetings - being dragged off by police or attacked by thugs of the opposition.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(fluttery laugh as she remembers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A long time ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAUDE>
<HAROLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What were you fighting for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAROLD>
<MAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Big Issues. Liberty. Rights. Justice. Kings died and kingdoms fell. I don't regret the kingdoms - what sense in borders and nations and patriotism - but I do miss the kings. When I was a little girl I was taken to the palace in Vienna, to a garden party. I can still see the sunshine, the parasols, and the flashing uniforms of the young officers. I thought then I would marry a soldier.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(fluttery laugh)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Later, Frederick would chide me about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(with a twinkle)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was so serious. A doctor at the University. And in the government.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Suddenly she gets quiet.
</DIRECTION>
<MAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But, that was all... before...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
Maude stares into the fire. She suddenly seems very small and fragile. Harold notices the change that has come over her and is not sure what to say.
</DIRECTION>
<HAROLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you don't use the umbrella any more?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAROLD>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him and says softly:
</DIRECTION>
<MAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.

</MAUDE>
<HAROLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No more revolts.

</HAROLD>
<MAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
(sparks back to her old self)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yes! Every day. But I don't need a defense anymore. I embrace! Still fighting for the Big Issues but now in my small, individual way. Shall we have a song?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAUDE>
<HAROLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I don't...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAROLD>
<MAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh come on. I'll teach you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
She goes to the piano, sits down, and plays. It is a fast, delightful song and she sings it with zest.
</DIRECTION>
<MAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Harold, join in the chorus.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
Beside her Harold hesitatingly sings along. The o.s. orchestra has joined in, enabling Maude to leave the piano and get up and dance. She capers in true old vaudeville fashion. As the song continues we go into a MONTAGE and see Maude dance as she sings in various locales - the beach, the forest, the fields, the hills, finally returning to her room to join up with Harold for a socko finish.
</DIRECTION>
<MAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, that was fun. Let's play something together.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAUDE>
<HAROLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I don't play anything.

</HAROLD>
<MAUDE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't play anything! Dear me. Everyone should be able to make some music. Why, it's life! - Rhythm and harmony - That's the cosmic dance. Come with me.

She goes over to a large cupboard and opens both doors. It is full of all kinds of musical instruments. She ferrets about for a while and pulls out a banjo.
</DIRECTION>
<MAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here we are. Just the thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
She shows him a chord and how to strum. - "Your fingers here... etc." He does it a few times.
</DIRECTION>
<MAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right. But be impulsive! Be fanciful! Let the music flow out of you as freely as though you were talking. Okay?

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	From the top -- Let's jam!

Harold starts to say something.

<MRS_CHASEN>

	One more thing, Harold. I've talked on the phone with your second computer date and she seems a very nice, quiet girl. Not at all hysterical like the first one. Nevertheless I want you to be on your best behavior when she comes tomorrow and make her feel at home.

We see the truck, now without the tree, go driving down the road. We see the cop on the motorbike. It is the same one as before. He sees the truck, grits his teeth, and speeds on after it.

The ice block is as we saw it the first night - unfinished and melting. Glaucus, bundled up in his winter clothes, falters towards it with a heavy hammer and chisel.

	When I look around me I know I know nothing. I remember though, once long ago in Persia, we met a wise man in the bazaar. He was a professional and used to sell his wisdom to anyone willing to pay. His specialty for tourists was a maxim engraved on the head of a pin. "The wisest," he said, "the truest, the most instructive words for all men at all times." Frederick bought one for me and back at the hotel I peered through a magnifying glass to read the words - "And this too shall pass away."

Partly because of the pot, but mostly because he has found a friend, Harold opens up for the first time in his life. As he gets into the story he tells it with such animation and delight that we are amazed at all the fun and zest he has kept locked up inside him.
</DIRECTION>
<HAROLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, the first time it wasn't even planned. It was when I was at boarding school and they were getting ready for the school Centennial Celebration and they put all the fireworks and food and stuff in this room in the West Wing. Well, on the floor above they had the Chemistry Lab and I had to stay in and clean it up. So I thought I'd do a little experimenting. I got all this stuff out and began mixing it up. It was very scientific. I was measuring the amounts. Well, suddenly there was this big fizzing sound and this white kind of porridge stuff began erupting out of the beaker, and moving along the desk and falling onto the floor. It was making an awful mess. So I got the hose to try to spray it into the sink. I turned on the water and - POW! There was this massive explosion. Knocked me down. Blew out the floor. Boards and brick and flames leaping up. Singed my hair. Smoke everywhere. I got up, then this sound like bombs going off. It was the fireworks in the room below. And all this stuff came flying out the hole. PACHAU! Skyrockets and pinwheels. And fire balls all whizzing and bouncing. And I was just standing there stunned - I couldn't believe it - just watching - being pelted by all these little pellets - turns out to be the goddamn popcorn spewed up from below. The whole place was a crazy inferno with the rockets and everything, and I couldn't get to the door. But behind me was this old laundry chute, so I hopped in that and slid down that to the basement. When I got outside I saw that the whole top of the building was on fire and, of course, it was pandemonium with people running around and fire alarms ringing. So I decided to go home. When I get there my mother is having this big party so I creep up the back stairs to my room. Then there is this ring on the doorbell. It's the police. I creep over to the banister to see what they say, and they tell my mother that I had been killed in a fire at school. Well, everyone got very quiet.

Maude runs out on the edge of the dam, right past a sign saying "Danger - No Trespassing." The water is churning below, making a deafening racket. Harold follows her. The General runs after him. Maude beats off Harold with her umbrella. The General joins the fray and most of the blows fall on him. Much ad-libbing. Despite only having one arm the General manages to pull the sign away from Harold and throw it over the dam. It is quickly churned up by the treacherous water. Harold is holding Maude's umbrella. Maude is gamely trying to hold on to it and at the same time keep hold of the shrunken head. The General joins the tussle for the umbrella. Furious ad libs as they scuffle. The General finally wrenches it free. A pause. Harold looks at Maude's position, standing next to the General. He reaches over and pulls the General's lanyard. The empty sleeve comes flying up for a salute, knocking Maude over the dam and into almost certain death amid the rushing water below.

A long pause. The two look down but there is no sign of Maude.

	They mocked me. They were representations of people I dearly loved yet they knew these people were gradually fading from me, and that in time all I would have left would be vague feelings - but sharp photographs! So I tossed them out. My memory fades, I know. But I prefer pictures made by me with feeling, and not by Kodak with silver nitrate.

	I cry when a man tortures his brother... when he repents and begs forgiveness... when forgiveness is refused... and when it is granted. To cry is to laugh. To laugh is to cry ... a uniquely human trait. And the main thing in life, my dear Harold, is not to be afraid to be human.

But I do think that it would be wisest for you not to leave the house or indulge in any kind of activity that would be newsworthy.

	<DIALOGUE>
	There's no doubt, Harold, this impending marriage adds another chapter to an already fascinating case. But let us examine it, and I think you'll realize there is a simple Freudian explanation for your romantic attachment to this older woman. It is known as the Oedipus Complex, a very common neurosis, particularly in this society, whereby the male child subconsciously wishes to sleep with his mother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PSYCHIATRIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course, what puzzles me, Harold, is that you want to sleep with your grandmother.

It is the same little old priest we have met earlier. He sits at his desk and addresses the camera like a TV audience. A picture of the Pope is over his right shoulder; a picture of Jesus Christ over his left.
</DIRECTION>
<PRIEST>
<DIRECTION>
(very reasoned and slow)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, Harold, the Church has nothing against the union of the old and the young. Each age has its own beauty. But a marital union is concerned with the conjugal rights. And the procreation of children. I would be remiss in my duties if I did not tell you that the idea of --

He passes the maternity ward. Laughing parents pointing at screaming infants. Their noise overrides the laughing baby and joins the rising intensity of the MUSIC.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO HAROLD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harold walks faster. His face is drawn with pain and tears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We TRACK before him. He looks left and sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A WOMAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
in a room, delirious with pain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
in disheveled pajamas walks from his room like a bewildered child, dribbling food down his front.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO HAROLD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He keeps walking fast. He looks right and sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FAMILY GROUP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
who have just been told of a death. They cry in each other's arms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A TEN-YEAR-OLD BOY confused, looks up at them, and begins to sob.

Gradually the fire dies down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly we hear the fumbled pluckings of Maude's Song on a banjo. It stops.

PANNING SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We PAN up left and there is Harold as large as life. He takes a look over the cliff.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His hearse is still quietly burning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO HAROLD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He wipes his nose with the back of his hand and tries again on the banjo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He barely gets the melody started before he is lost. Summoning up all his concentration, he tries again, and this time he manages to get the fingering right. He continues playing and turns away from the edge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. TRACKING SHOT IN FRONT OF HAROLD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He started slow but now he is gradually beginning to play the song in its original upbeat tempo. He gets better and better at it. The song is very catching and Harold's tear-stained face registers what could be a smile. He walks by the CAMERA and we turn with him, and HOLD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A full orchestra joins in the playing and we watch Harold amble down the road, strumming along, until he is only a small figure in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
