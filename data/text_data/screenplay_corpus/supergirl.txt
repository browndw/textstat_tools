<DIRECTION>
INT. ARGO CITY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AND REVEALS THE inside of a domed city honeycombed with fantastic arches. The city is inhabited by young beautiful people in luxurious but simple costumes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAMERA ROAMS through the City, observing some people seated at a kind of cafe sipping drinks and relaxing; other people are in some kind of exercise class doing beautiful graceful movement; and finally a class of five year old children listen intently to a teacher who is demonstrating a molecular model.
</DIRECTION>
<TEACHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And now, who can give me the electron wave functions for Kryptonian covalent bonding?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TEACHER>
<DIRECTION>
The five year olds eagerly raise their hands. The teacher points to one.

The teacher smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<TEACHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, maybe that was a bit too easy...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TEACHER>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAMERA ROAMS ON through the city, following the sound of a strange, ethereally beautiful singing. The CAMERA discovers the source of the sound: an ARTIST sculpting a beautiful crystalline object with a MATTERWAND. The wand makes the singing noise as it creates matter out of energy. The Artist, whose name is ZALTAR, sometimes whistles along in counterpoint. .
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small girl is watching him with fascination. Her name is Kara, and she is seven.

Behind her, the dome, which encloses the City, marks the edge of the limbo outside.

<KARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you making:

</KARA>
<ZALTAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's going to be a tree, I think.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZALTAR>
<KARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's a tree?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARA>
<ZALTAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's something they have on Earth. You know, where your cousin went.

</ZALTAR>
<KARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is Earth?

</KARA>
<ZALTAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't you study six-dimensional geometry in school?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZALTAR>
<KARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I know the equations---I just can't see it in my head.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARA>
<DIRECTION>
Zaltar laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<ZALTAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Even I have trouble with that sometimes. Earth is in outer space. And we're in inner space.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZALTAR>
<KARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't understand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARA>
<ZALTAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait till you're older. Here -- watch this.

</ZALTAR>
<DIRECTION>
Zaltar takes a small OMEGAHEDRON out of his pocket and holds it in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<ZALTAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is one of the four Power Sources of the City. I borrowed it from the Guardians. Look what I can do with it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZALTAR>
<DIRECTION>
Zaltar touches his MATTER.WAND to the OMEGAHEDRON and the wand instantly becomes charged with flickering light. He touches his wand to the tree sculpture---and the sculpture comes alive with dancing lights and shadows. Kara claps her hands with delight at the spectacle. Zaltar steps back and admires his handiwork. He carefully puts down the OMEGAHEDRON at his feet, takes a small flask from his belt, and drinks.
</DIRECTION>
<ZALTAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see, a tree is a living thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZALTAR>
<KARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you create life?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARA>
<ZALTAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no, just the illusion of life. A kind of half-life, maybe. A pale shadow of the real thing. But it is lovely, the way the light plays over the surface. . .
	</DIALOGUE>

A woman's voice can be heard calling in the distance.

Kara calls out in reply.

</KARA>
<DIRECTION>
Kara's mother ALURA appears through the lacey architecture of the city.
</DIRECTION>
<ALURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kara, you shouldn't be so near the Edge without a grown-up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALURA>
<KARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, Mother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARA>
<ZALTAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was keeping an eye on her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZALTAR>
<DIRECTION>
Alura puts her arm around her daughter affectionately, showing she's not really angry. Together they watch Zaltar's latest sculpture, flickering with the play of inner light and shadow.
</DIRECTION>
<ALURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Zaltar, but she has to obey the rules.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALURA>
<DIRECTION>
Zaltar takes another swig from his flask. and lowers his voice confidentially.
</DIRECTION>
<ZALTAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You and your husband have been kind to me, Alura. I have something to tell you: I'm going away. Soon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZALTAR>
<ALURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But where?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALURA>
<DIRECTION>
Zaltar bends down to Kara and hands her his matterwand.
</DIRECTION>
<ZALTAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put your fingers there, Kara. And press hard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZALTAR>
<DIRECTION>
She does, and the wand makes a horrible squawk. Kara laughs with delight.
</DIRECTION>
<ZALTAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. Now, go make something pretty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZALTAR>
<DIRECTION>
Kara scampers away, hardly able to believe her good fortune, and starts to make all kinds of surprising sounds with the wand on the plaza nearby. Zaltar speaks to Alura in a low, confidential voice.
</DIRECTION>
<ZALTAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've discovered a new way into the Phantom Zone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZALTAR>
<ALURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But the phantom Zone is for criminals.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALURA>
<ZALTAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's big. And empty. I'm tired of limiting myself to Argo City. I want to do something new. I'm starting to repeat myself here with this airy, glittery stuff....
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZALTAR>
<DIRECTION>
Zaltar waves a hand deprecatingly at the city around him.
</DIRECTION>
<ALURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But Zaltar---you founded the city! It's yours. We were all just refugees from Krypton when you gathered us together and brought us here, to the inner dimension. You can't abandon us now. You have a responsibility to us!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALURA>
<DIRECTION>
In the background, Kara has been modeling a spiky insect-like CREATURE. Now she suddenly finds the OMEGAHEDRON on the ground beside her. She doesn't stop to wonder how it got there from beside Zaltar's feet. She simply picks up the OMEGAHEDRON and touches it to the spiky creature. The creature suddenly flicks its wings and COMES TO LIFE, unnoticed by the adults. Kara drops the wand and laughs out loud with delight as the magical creature takes off from the ground and starts flying in circles around her head, glittering as if it were made of diamonds.
</DIRECTION>
<ZALTAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm an artist, Alura. My work comes first. Other people come second.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZALTAR>
<ALURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How can you create beauty...with a selfish heart? The spiky insect-creature flies closer and closer around the little girl's head, buzzing angrily. Her look of delight turns to fear. She tries to shoo the creature away. It flies off toward the thin membrane that encloses the city.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALURA>
<DIRECTION>
The spiky creature flies into the membrane and tears a ragged hole in it. With a giant WHOOSH all the air in the city starts to rush out the hole. Kara is swept along toward the hole by the wind. She cries out and stretches pleading hands toward her mother. THE OMEGAHEDRON is swept toward the hole as well. Kara grabs onto the ragged edge of the membrane.
</DIRECTION>
<ZALTAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kara---the Power Source!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZALTAR>
<DIRECTION>
Kara reaches for it, but it is too far from her, and the OMEGAHEDRON is sucked out into infinity by the wind. Zaltar picks up the matterwand from where Kara dropped it and touches her with the wand. She is instantly held fast. Zaltar pulls her back inside. He gives her to her mother Alura. Then Zaltar touches his wand to the membrane and seals the hole with masterful chords like a brass choir.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wind dies down and all is silent, except for the quiet sobbing of Kara in her mother's arms. Zaltar kneels down beside her and strokes her golden hair tenderly.
</DIRECTION>
<KARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry... I didn't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARA>
<ZALTAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was my fault. You aren't old enough to use the wand. I shouldn't have given it to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZALTAR>
<ALURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But the Power Source, Zaltar.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALURA>
<ZALTAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It couldn't be helped. The city will have to make do with three.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZALTAR>
<ALURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But what will happen?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALURA>
<ZALTAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Guardians will be angry. They may even send me to the Phantom Zone. You see, I didn't really have permission to borrow it. I must go explain to them...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZALTAR>
<DIRECTION>
Zaltar hurries off nervously. THE CAMERA HOLDS ON KARA'S FACE as she senses this may be her last sight of Zaltar.

DISSOLVE TO: EXT. A SPRINGTIME MEADOW - U.S.A. - DAY. UNDER TITLES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beautiful blonde in jeans and a frilly blouse is walking across a field of wildflowers. Butterflies flitter and dart from flower to flower. The blonde's name is SELENA. She is our ideal image of the girl next door, who grew up into a dynamite lady.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her current boyfriend follows along behind her, lugging a big wicker hamper from their pickup truck parked at the edge of the road. Selena finds a grassy spot under an old oak. and spreads out a red and white checked gingham cloth..
</DIRECTION>
<SELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Over here George. It's the perfect spot. Nice view.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SELENA>
<DIRECTION>
George sets down the wicker basket and Selena starts to unpack a scrumptious picnic of home cooked food. She unpacks fried chicken, hard-boiled eggs, potato salad, cold beer and a big rich creamy-frosted devils food cake.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sure are a good cook, Selena. Man, that looks too pretty to eat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<SELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Better eat it quick. It won't look too pretty when it's all covered with ants.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SELENA>
<DIRECTION>
She hands him a chicken drumstick and a hard-boiled egg.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Selena, I've been thinking. It's time I settled down---and I don't know a nicer lady to settle down with than you.

</GEORGE>
<SELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why George, are you proposing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SELENA>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marry me, Selena. The hardware store doesn't bring in much now, but...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<SELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	George---I thought you'd never ask.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SELENA>
<DIRECTION>
A shrill whistling sound from above makes them look up. With a loud plop and a spatter of icing the OMEGAHEDRON falls into the middle of the chocolate cake.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the heck is that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
They look up in the boughs of the tree overhead, and then down at the chocolate cake splashed all over the checked cloth.
</DIRECTION>
<SELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A squirrel Frisbee?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SELENA>
<DIRECTION>
Selena reaches out and picks up the OMEGAHEDRON. It comes away from the cake without a trace of the chocolate icing sticking to its surface, as if made of some substance, which repels other kinds of matter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Selena holds the shining Omegahedron in her hand and examines it, turning it around and around as if hypnotized. Her face takes on a new expression. Almost as if the simple, wholesome innocence of her nature had been blasted away by some profound new knowledge of the universe.
</DIRECTION>
<SELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's funny. I'd swear I know just what this is, but I've never seen it before.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SELENA>
<DIRECTION>
She stands up and walks across the checkered cloth, in a beeline for the pickup truck.

ANOTHER ANGLE. ARGO CITY. DIMMED
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are in the assembly amphitheater of the city, where the kindergarten nuclear physics class was seen. Kara is in the centre of the ring, with adults seated in scattered rows around her. Her parents Zor-El and Alura are standing in front of her.

	ZOR-EL
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.

<KARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I allowed it to escape the City.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARA>
<ALURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ever since we told you how your cousin Superman was sent there as an infant, all you have wanted to do was visit this place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALURA>
<KARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I do want to go. But someone must go. Our scanning shows the Power Source has finally reached the Earth. It could destroy everything unless someone brings it back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	ZOR-EL
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Superman will return it.
</DIRECTION>
<KARA>

	</DIALOGUE>
</KARA>
<KARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll have super powers there. Like him. We can't wait. Our lights are fading. Look around you. When I was a child the City was bright and shining. Look at it now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARA>
<DIRECTION>
Zor-El and Alura sigh. There is no denying that the brilliance of Argo City has been much dimmed since Kara was a little girl.
</DIRECTION>
<ALURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do your teachers think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALURA>
<DIRECTION>
Zor-El looks around the circle. A beautiful woman speaks.
</DIRECTION>
<TEACHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It would be sad to lose one of our finest young ones to the dimension barrier-- but the City cannot last much longer without the Power Source. It is her future she's fighting for, Zor-El.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TEACHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	ZOR-EL
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Very well, let it be done.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alura embraces Kara emotionally, fighting back the tears. Kara too is struggling to control her own emotions.
</DIRECTION>
<KARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry, Mother, I'll be all right. I've studied the transmissions from Earth. I know their customs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARA>

Kara walks out of the amphitheater with her parents.
</DIRECTION>
<ALURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But they are such strange, unstable people.

</ALURA>
<KARA>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
They embrace, briefly. Kara then steps onto a circular platform set into the pavement of the city.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Instantly transparent bubble forms around her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her parents watch as she floats away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She passes into an air lock through the membrane that surrounds the City, and off into an infinity of space.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MONTAGE: THE JOURNEY OF KARA INSIDE "HER SPHERE FROM THE INNER DIMENSION TO OUR WORLD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her sphere moves from blackness, to a dark green limbo. The atmosphere thickens around her. Soon it is unmistakably water, and she is heading toward the light above. A fish darts past with a flash of silver. The sphere rushes upward faster and faster. It breaks the surface of the , water. Kara springs free of the bubble, which disappears. She is now wearing a blue and red costume like her cousin Superman.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She lands on a nearby beach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. EARTH. BEACH BESIDE THE SEA. SUNRISE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks around her, feasting with her eyes on the details of this new exciting world.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kara bends down and picks up a stone from the ground at her feet. To her astonishment, she crushes it to powder in her hand, and blows the fine dust away with a blast of superbreath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks down at her feet, so firmly planted on the ground. She rises a few inches into the air, and reacts with amazement. Then she looks up into the blue sky overhead and her expression of astonishment is replaced by a look of joyous longing. With a sudden impulse she shoots straight upward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HIGH ABOVE THE EARTH. DAY

Kara loops and rolls, swoops and circles, laughing with sheer delight.

Kara lands on a mountaintop and admires the view. The she bends down and scoops up a handful of snow. She stares at it with awe.

INSERT. MICROSCOPIC SHOT OF SNOW CRYSTALS IN ALL THEIR INFINITE VARIETY AND BEAUTY.

<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kara stands up, smiling. She flies into the air again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FOREST. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She lands and walks among the huge trunks of a primeval forest. Shafts of sunlight pierce the gloom. These trees are much more impressive than Zaltar's imitation back in Argo City. She hears a mournful sound and pulls back a spray of brambles. She sees a BABY DEER hopelessly tangled in the long canes. She shoots RAYS OF HEAT VISION from her eyes and slices through the tough stems. The fawn scrambles free, and scampers off into the forest. Kara watches it with a benevolent smile. She removes a brunette wig and some street clothing from a secret pocket in her cape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MANSION --- GARDEN PARTY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A big impressive house somewhere in the Middle West. People mill about on the neatly manicured lawn sipping drinks and snagging hors d'oeuvres off silver trays from. passing waiters. All the quests have a name tag on, like at some kind of conference.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SELENA, the blonde who discovered the Power Source, is circulating among the quests. She has changed since we saw her last. No longer the girl next door, she now wears a fabulous designer dress dripping with jewels. She walks with the regal air of someone used to being obeyed, and graciously accepts the homage of the quests. A smile, a nod, a kind word from her leaves them all basking in the warm afterglow of her attention. But we notice odd details of the party: the decorations are all based on mystic occult symbols. At the refreshment table, there is a big ten-foot WICKER SCULPTURE OF A FEMALE GOAT covered with paper flowers. And the quests all have an indefinable air of strangeness about them. BIANCA, a tall cold-eyed brunette in black silk dress, whispers in Selena's ear .
</DIRECTION>

	You're not going anywhere. Except back to nowheresville. You're too impatient, Selena. Look around you--all these people have served years and years of apprenticeship. Some of their families have been in the Craft for generations. You can't join and take over our whole organization in a few months.

A BLACK CLOUD OF SHADOW bursts out of the centre of the OMEGAHEDRON, filling the room. Selena drops the gargoyle box and shrinks back with sudden misgivings at what she has unleashed. Even Bianca's face has gone white. The two women huddle together as a HUGE INVISIBLE PRESENCE fills the room with darkness. Then the unseen presence suddenly SMASHES ITS WAY OUTSIDE THROUGH THE SOLID WALL OF SELENA'S LIVING ROOM, leaving a big hole and a trail of crushed furniture behind it. Light returns to the room as the shadow departs. And from outside the sound of crackling shrubbery dies away. Selena regains her composure and looks around at the mess of her once splendid living room.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Linda drives up in Lucy's car, the one left behind at the scene of the accident outside the hamburger place. She drives past the paddle tennis court and parks in front of the dorm. Linda gets out of the car, and lets herself into the dorm with a key. Inside, she signs her name in the book.
</DIRECTION>

Linda walks down the long dormitory corridor past room after empty room. The place is kind of spooky.

INT. LINDA'S ROOM. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Linda enters the room she shares with Lucy. She puts Lucy's car keys on her bedside table next to the snapshots of Lucy's family and of her half-dozen current boyfriends. Linda turns and crosses the room to her own monastic bed in its drab, undecorated corner. She lies down on her bed with a sigh, staring at the ceiling in a melancholy mood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, she senses that something is not right. She gets up from the bed, walks to the window, and gazes out a-t the deserted campus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OUTSIDE DORM. TENNIS COURT. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dorm is set apart from other school buildings and surrounded by tall trees. The tennis court is visible from Linda's window, and a city park adjoining the school property. The UNSEEN MONSTER is heard approaching through the park with a thud of heavy footfalls and the crack of snapping tree trunks and branches. A bolt of lightning flashes, followed by a crash of thunder. The wind howls. A storm is brewing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Far away across the campus something huge and powerful forces itself between the two big oaks, snapping them like matchsticks. The unseen monster hauls its enormous bulk toward the dormitory, crushing everything in its path, its footsteps making the ground tremble like an earthquake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LINDA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Linda watches with uncomprehending eyes the approaching swath of destruction heading straight for her. Nothing she has learned about this strange alien world has prepared" her for this. For the first time since she left Argo City, her eyes show fear. And yet there's a deeper streak of defiance in her that impels her to stand her ground and face the horrible juggernaut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FORM. TENNIS COURT. CAMPUS. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HUGE FOOTPRINTS sink into the damp grass of the campus. A bicycle rack full of Schwinns is flattened into the dirt with a metallic screech. The monster proceeds inexorably toward the wooden rain shelter on one side of the tennis court. The shelter is crushed to kindling wood. The monster drags its enormous unseen bulk across the smooth clay surface of the tennis court, crunching , deep cracked depressions in the clay. The net stretches and groans toward Linda as the' invisible enormity comes closer, and finally snaps with a loud twanging sound as the steel cables part. The tall cyclone fence bulges outward toward Linda and momentarily outlines the form of" the monster before it crumples and falls with the screech of twisted steel. The only thing between Linda and the monster is Lucy.' s parked car. The monster stomps the car flat with a noise like colliding express trains and heads for Linda.

	Leave this place and do no harm.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Something picks Supergirl up and flings her against the wall of the dorm, crushing the soft drink dispenser under her and squirting cola in every direction. Lightning flashes and thunder booms overhead. Supergirl picks herself up, shaken.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She launches herself directly at the space in mid-air ten feet above the monster's footprints. She crashes into something hard and invisible with the sound of a tremendous impact. Supergirl falls to the ground, staggered by the concussion. The irresistible force has met the immovable object. Supergirl looks up, and---altering the wavelength of her X-Ray vision to a transcendental frequency---paints this beam over the monster and just for an instant makes it visible: a HUGE NIGHTMARE SHAPE LOOMING OVER HER, AND REACHING OUT TO CRUSH HER WITH MASSIVE TALONS. Then the image fades.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Supergirl is seized again and flung against the school flagpole, breaking it off at the base. Supergirl stands up and seizes the flagpole. She looks up at the flickering lightning in the sky. She flies straight upward into the storm with the bare flagpole held in front of her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THUNDER STORM. LIGHTNING
</DIRECTION>

Again and again huge bolts of lightning strike the flagpole. Supergirl's face is contorted with agony as her body absorbs enough electricity to run Las Vegas for a year. She looks down and sees through a break in the clouds the campus far below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CAMPUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Supergirl dives down from the sky, glowing with accumulated electricity. She embraces the monster with a tremendous crackle of energy. The two of them are bathed in brilliant arc light. The monster is briefly made visible again by the energy. But this time it is shrinking, shriveling up into a shapeless lump. The light fades as the energy is discharged. A dark, shapeless lump detaches itself from Supergirl's grasp and flies shrieking away into the night. Supergirl stands alone and exhausted, her muscles trembling with fatigue.

She turns and walks unsteadily back toward the dorm.

Selena removes the gargoyle-shaped box from her sleeve and opens the lid. The OMEGAHEDRON inside spins and sends out a powerful force, which slides the nurse backwards out the door and pins her to the wall of the corridor outside. The door slams shut. Selena closes the lid of the Coffer and turns to Ethan.

Selena gestures with the gargoyle box at the men and their guns fly out of their hands and up to the ceiling. The men stare at the ce1ling, astonished. Ethan takes advantage of the distraction to dash out through the open door. Selena turns to look at Ethan escaping and the guns fall to the floor and discharge. The security men run into Ethan's bathroom, slamming the door behind them.

Selena ducks out into the corridor.

Ethan is running away down the corridor. Frightened patients peek out of their rooms. The nurse who was ejected from the room cringes in fear as Selena emerges into the corridor.

Ethan dodges past two orderlies who are pushing a HEART-LUNG MACHINE down from the surgery. Selena raises the gargoyle box and points it at the HEART-LUNG MACHINE.

<DIRECTION>
The HEART-LUNG MACHINE comes to life---its lights flash, its array of tubes tipped with needle probes writhe like Medusa's hair, its wheels turn around, and it chases Ethan down the corridor. Selena laughs her deep throaty chuckle of triumph. Ethan looks behind, sees the machine chasing him and cries out with alarm. A CART OF SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS rolls out of a closet in front of him, its scalpels standing up and pointing at him, quivering eagerly, blocking his path.
</DIRECTION>

Ethan dives through a swinging door to his left.

INT. OPERATING THEATRE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A team of surgeons and nurses are bent over a patient on the table. Ethan runs through in the background. The surgeons continue with their work. The heart-lung machine wheels through after him, followed by the scalpels flying through the air like a swarm of hornets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The surgical team doesn't look up from their work.

Several cylinders of anesthetic gas tear themselves loose from the wall and trundle away out of the room after Ethan and the other apparatus. One of the nurses finally looks up.

Ethan bursts into an empty surgical X-Ray room---the pursuing apparatus visible a few yards behind. He slams the heavy lead-lined door and bolts it shut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He hears the thud of the apparatus beating impotently against the door. He leans against the door panting, his cotton hospital gown and robe soaked with cold sweat. Suddenly, with a whir of motors, the giant multi-armed C.A.T. SCANNER behind him comes to life, its lights glowing, and reaches out its chrome steel arms toward him.

Ethan yells, runs across the room, climbs on a gurney, rips a metal grill off the wall, and dives into the air conditioning duct.

Jimmy is acutely aware how pathetic his daffodils look as he fumbles in his pocket for a dollar for the delivery boy.

Ethan batters the top off a ventilator and crawls out onto the roof. He turns and quickly replaces the aluminum top, bashing it firmly closed with his fist. He straightens up, sweat-soaked, bedraggled, haggard and exhausted, looking like an escaped lunatic with his disheveled hair and his torn hospital robe. He heaves a sigh of relief, and turns to see Selena standing behind him, her silk cape billowing in the breeze.

INT. DODGEM CARS TENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He falls through the tent and onto the electrified floor below. The wooden gondola shatters on impact. Ethan sits up, dazed by the fall, and sees a dodgem car painted like the face of a vicious football player heading toward him. Ethan scrambles away on his hands and knees. Another hideously painted car attacks him, and another, and another. He dodges and scuttles around desperately. Finally he manages to climb aboard one of the cars.

EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK

<DIRECTION>
Supergirl reaches out to seize Selena. But Selena holds up the gargoyle box and is surrounded by an impenetrable, glowing shield of force. Supergirl tries to push through, the shield in vain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Supergirl flies to the little fence made out of steel spikes surrounding the Haunted House. At super speed she rips up the entire line of fence posts and hurls them like javelins at Selena.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Selena dissolves her force field and tries to run away, ducking and dodging the rain of javelins. She turns too quickly and the GARGOYLE BOX slips out of her hand and rolls underneath the deck of the carousel. Selena moans with despair, and pauses, reluctant to leave without the box. This is the opportunity Supergirl needs. The fence posts bury themselves in the ground in a perfect circle around Selena---effectively imprisoning her.

Supergirl lands Ethan in his battered dodgem car on a beautiful, deserted tropical beach. Palm trees wave over a white sand beach. The blue ca1m of a lagoon mirrors huge white clouds that hang motipn1ess on the horizon like colossal snowy mountains. Gaily-coloured parrots screech in the branches of blooming hibiscus and jacaranda. Ethan gets out of his carnival ride and gazes around w1th awe at the beautiful scene.

Rolls Royces, limos, and Maserattis parked in the driveway. It looks like a meeting of the ostentatious car club. A helicopter lands on the front lawn.

FOR AN INSTANT SELENA SEES HER REFLECTION IN THE MIRROR. BEHIND HER LOOMS THE DARK, EVIL PRESENCE, INVISIBLE TO THE OTHERS IN THE ROOM, AND MUCH LARGER THAN WHEN SHE GLIMPSED IT AT HER GARDEN PARTY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then Bianca leaps to the mirror and pulls the veil back across it. Bianca stands challenging Nigel, daring him to try again. Selena looks at the gargoyle-shaped Coffer of Shadow, sitting beside her hearth. It too seems much larger than when we last saw it at the hospital. Selena wonders for a beat if maybe Nigel is right. Can the Shadow be ruling her?

They all draw their sacred white-handled knives out of concealment in their clothing. Nigel defiantly places his on the floor with its blade pointing inward. Then one by one, the others put down their knives with the blades pointing outward. They all look at Nigel. His shoulders sag with dejection.

His knife turns by itself on the floor until its blade points outward. Everyone joins hands in the circle. A fire springs to life on the hearth. Someone starts to chant in a strange ancient tongue. Slowly the heavy, opulent living room begins to change: the carpet becomes the floor of an ancient stone temple with dark brown stains splattered across its massive granite blocks, the walls start to melt away. Outside the windows the dark night is replaced by hot, brutal sunlight pounding down on an endless desert stretching away to the horizon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The house completely dissolves and is replaced by monumental stone ruins. The smoky fire crackles and sends its dark plumes boiling skyward. The only thing remaining of Selena's house is the hearth and the Coffer of Shadow. Selena stands up And walks out of the centre of the circle toward the Coffer. She opens the lid. She pulls the glass vial off the golden chain around her neck and drops it into the Coffer.

</DIRECTION>

Selena steps forth from the column of fire. She is clothed in a shimmering garment---white with flashing highlights of rainbow iridescence. The six other members of her group fall to their knees in awe. Selena seems to glow with an inner radiance. She laughs, and the pagan temple around her changes back to the living room of her house in Midvale. In her shining gossamer gown and her new aura of majesty, she seems too large, too powerful to be contained in the familiar surroundings of her house.

Supergirl looks into Bianca's eyes with her calm, heroic gaze, and Bianca comes somewhat to her senses. Bianca points to the adjoining bar. Supergirl walks over warily and sees FIVE GOLDEN CAGES suspended among the bottles. Nigel and the four remaining members of the Circle are imprisoned in them, shrunken but alive. Nige1 is in a perpetually turning squirrel wheel. He sees her and calls out.

INT. SELENA'S NEW HOUSE (A MOUNTAIN-TOP PALACE)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ethan is in a dark, shadowy place, bound to a stake with stout cords. Sticks of wood are piled all around his feet. Selena stands beside him in her shining gown of power. She looks even more gorgeous and cruel than before. She offers him a glass of water to drink, but he turns his head away violently.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>

	I'm wise to your tricks, lady.

<ETHAN>

	If that worked, you would've done it already. No, you want me to drink it of my own free will. Well let me tell you, sweetheart, it'll be a cold day in hell before I fall for that one again.

</ETHAN>
<SELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go on, talk big! I'll soon have you purring like a kitten.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SELENA>
<DIRECTION>
She puts the glass of water in a, basket at the end of an iron chain hanging down from above. There is a straw in the glass at such an angle that Ethan can just reach it with his lips if he stretches as far as possible.
</DIRECTION>
<SELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've been without water for a whole day. Let's see how thirsty you get in a week.

<SELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Careful, don't make me angry. I start fires when I'm angry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SELENA>
<DIRECTION>
She glances meaningfully at the faggots piled around his feet and walks away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAMERA FOLLOWS HER revealing that she has been talking to Ethan inside the mammoth fireplace of her living room. Her new house is enormous. Where before she lived in a mansion, now she dwells in a palace. The fireplace is seven feet high, the living room floor is wide as a football field, and. the French windows into the garden now tower like the windows in the North transept of Chartres Cathedral. Selena disappears out the imposing portals which lead to the wet bar and butler's pantry--each now the size of a basketball court.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Back in the fireplace, Ethan cranes his neck to make sure she has gone, then reaches out toward the glass hanging nearby. He pokes the straw with his forehead. The glass swings slightly. The glass swings close enough for him to bump it with his forehead and set up a rhythm. He gauges the swing of the glass and, at the precise moment, grabs for it with his mouth. He catches hold of the rim of the glass with his teeth and holds it there for a moment as he summons his courage to do what must be done. He bites hard on the rim of the glass with his teeth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The glass shatters and falls to the floor with a crash, leaving Ethan with a small fragment of the rim in his mouth and a trickle of blood down his chin. He leans his head over until it is directly above his left hand tied to the stake two and a half feet below his shoulders. A droplet of blood falls into his hand. He drops the glass fragment down to his hand and catches it. He grins, and sighs with relief. Then spits to clear his mouth. Slowly he saws. at the ropes that hold him with the sliver of glass in his left hand. One by one the strands part.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ethan strains against his bonds and the weakened rope snaps. He quickly disentangles himself from the coils and steps out of the fireplace. He looks around the mammoth room. The coast is clear. He spits a few bits of glass out of his mouth, and dashes out of the doors to the garden.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SELENA'S HOUSE. GARDEN. CONSERVATORY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ethan sees a green plastic garden hose, which the gardener has left running in a trickle to irrigate the hydrangeas. Ethan remembers that he is very thirsty. He picks up the hose, rinses out his mouth hurriedly, and then takes long, desperate gulps of the water. Behind him he hears Selena's laughter. He drops the hose as if stung by an electric eel and turns to see her emerge from behind a large strangler fig.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT ETHAN'S P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The same effect as when he drank the love potion the first time. The plants of the conservatory swirl and distort in garish nightmare colours. At the centre of his vision is an area of crystal clarity surrounding Selena. She approaches him seductively, fully confident of her power. As she comes nearer, the clear area expands and drives out the visual chaos. Selena speaks, and her voice is a close-miked throaty purr.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ethan is held by the spell of her magic. And yet there is part of him that still resists. You can see him try to turn his head away from the vision of ideal beauty before him, and then give in as she comes closer and I touches him with her hand. A zap of energy passes between them at her touch.
</DIRECTION>
<SELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kiss me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SELENA>
<DIRECTION>
He embraces her roughly and crushes her lips with a kiss. He is filled with a tigerish lust that thrills her deeply. She rakes her long red fingernails across his back and moans with pleasure.

EXT. GARDEN BEHIND SELENA'S NEW HOUSE. DAY

<DIRECTION>
Supergirl lands and walks toward the towering French doors of the living room. But something distracts her. She turns and enters the gigantic conservatory to her right.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONSERVATORY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Supergirl looks around and sees in the middle of the conservatory a reflecting pool surrounded by exotic plants. She walks closer and looks down into the reflecting pool. In the bottom of the shallow pool she sees Ethan securely bound. His eyes stare wildly. Dead or drowning.
</DIRECTION>
<SUPERGIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ethan!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUPERGIRL>
<DIRECTION>
She leaps into the shallow pool, and sinks over her head. A polygonal section of the surface of the reflecting pool detaches itself from the water and rises up perpendicularly. It is a door to the Phantom Zone. Supergirl is trapped behind an impenetrable force field, looking out in despair. Ethan is not there with her. His image has disappeared.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The real flesh and blood Ethan appears with Selena from behind the strangler fig. They look in at Supergirl trapped behind the shimmering polygon that la ads to the Phantom Zone. Selena laughs at her, but Ethan stares as if at a long forgotten acquaintance whose name he is trying to recall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Selena notices Ethan's wandering attention and she puts her arms possessively around him.
</DIRECTION>
<SELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>

	No. No. It isn't true.

The image of Selena and Ethan begins to recede, getting smaller and smaller, until it vanishes entirely in infinite blackness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SPACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The flat two-dimensional polygon that is Supergirl's prison whirls away through space. Behind the transparent surface we can see Supergirl's face stained with tears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PHANTOM ZONE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another kind of reality. Unlike anything we have ever seen. The crystal prison lands on the ground of the Phantom Zone and shatters. Supergirl picks herself up from among the fragments of her prison and looks around. The landscape is utterly strange and alien, with a feel of stark, oppressive sterility. As far as the eye can see there is no sign of life. Supergirl stands up and raises her arms to fly. She hops into the air about eight inches and lands flat-footedly on the sand. With a shock she realises SHE CAN'T FLY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She hops a few more times, with no more success.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She picks up a small rock from the ground. She tries to crush it in her hand. She can't. Angrily she hurls it from her as far as she can. Instead of disappearing into infinity it drops at her feet a few yards away. She scoops up some sand from the ground and holds it cupped in her hand. She takes a deep breath and tries to blow it away. She is barely able to disturb a few grains. She drops the sand and sits down on a rock, forlorn and dejected.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly she hears Alura's voice, very faint and coming from a long distance away.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The DELEGATE FROM URITANIA is going on (in Esperanto) denouncing the latest outrage against his peace-loving country. A few bored DELEGATES of various nationalities are sprawled in their seats listening to the simultaneous translation over earphones. The dign1fied PRESIDENT of the General Assembly is sitting on the dais behind the ranting delegate. With a FLASH OF LIGHT and a chok1ng cloud of sulfur fumes, Selena appears beside the podium. She is in her shimmering white robe. The dozing delegates wake up with amazement. The URITANIAN delegate stares at her with his mouth open as she slides him away from the microphone.

Inside the translator's booth, the entire panorama of the enormous hall is visible through the glass window. The eight TRANSLATORS stop translating and stare at the scene below.

BACK TO GENERAL ASSEMBLY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Selena is about to speak in the microphone, when two SECURITY GQUARDS attempt to step onto the podium. Selena reaches out toward them. A field of force from her hands stops them in their tracks, knocking them backwards off the steps to land on their butts. The delegates gasp at this act of magical violence.
</DIRECTION>
<SELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nations of the world! I bring you tidings of a new age!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SELENA>
<DIRECTION>
The President of the General Assembly starts to shout at her and bang on the podium with his gavel. Selena looks over her shoulder with mild annoyance. Instantly the President's gavel turns into a live eel. The President drops it with horror. Selena continues her speech.
</DIRECTION>
<SELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I bring you a return to the ancient true worship of Nature, our Sovereign Queen and Mother. And I bring you myself as her representative here on Earth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SELENA>
<DIRECTION>
The URITANIAN suddenly recovers his wits and tries to place a hand on Selena's shoulder. A whirlwind hurls him off the podium into the desks of the front row delegates. The delegates babble in consternation but keep to their seats. Selena raises her voice to be heard over the uproar.
</DIRECTION>
<SELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	From this moment forth, all science, religion and other unnatural beliefs are forbidden. And in their place I will teach the One True Way of our ancient grandmothers.

The President of the General Assembly has recovered enough from the surprise of the eel to interrupt Selena.

Selena has listened with a mocking smile as he speaks. He finishes to a smattering of applause from some of the delegates.

<SELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Threats? I don't need threats to destroy civilisation. I have something better.

She snaps her fingers in the air. Immediately a RAIN OF MONEY BEGINS TO FALL ALL OVER THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY. PAPER MONEY AND COINS OF ALL NATIONS. Selena looks at her work with pleasure. Then she disappears in a FLASH OF LIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The delegates blink with astonishment. The only trace of her presence is the tang of sulfur in the air---and the money. One delegate forgets his dignity and starts scooping up money from his desk and stuffing it into his pockets. Suddenly all the delegates are doing the same thing. The only exception is the delegate from the United Kingdom who thinks it might be beneath his dignity, and looks about with mild disapproval.

EXT. THE PHANTOM ZONE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Supergirl walks across the rolling monotony of the Phantom Zone. We have never seen her like this before: sweating, her hair unkempt, streaks of dirt and grit on her face, exhausted and full of despair. She stumbles at the crest of a low ridge and falls down to the bottom of the slope, banging her head on a rock. She sits there, a big rip in her ,uniform, rubbing her bruised forehead. It is hard to imagine her any worse off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She hears a sound, vaguely familiar. She looks around for its source. She follows the sound, crawling slowly along the base of the ridge. The sound gets louder and as she, approaches. It is a sound of celestial, spiritual beauty: the music of the spheres.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly she comes out into a tiny valley in the Phantom Zone and sees before her the most beautiful sight she could imagine. The harsh monochromatic sterility of the Phantom Zone gives way to a riot of bright colours. A dome-like building protrudes from the ground. All around it are gorgeous singing sculptures in the style of Argo City. A sculptor. in the clothing of Argo City is modeling a glassy statue with a matterwand. He turns and catches sight of Supergirl. It is Zaltar.
</DIRECTION>
<SUPERGIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Zaltar.

Zaltar drops his wand and comes running over to Supergirl. He kneels beside her on the sandy ground.
</DIRECTION>
<ZALTAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kara? Is it you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZALTAR>
<DIRECTION>
Supergirl nods. She is obviously exhausted. Zaltar takes the bulb full of liquid off his belt and offers her a drink. She drinks thirstily of the refreshing green liquid, and feels strength returning to her body.
</DIRECTION>
<SUPERGIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is this place?

	</DIALOGUE>
</ZALTAR>
<DIRECTION>
He helps her to her feet and over to his house, a sort of Argonian gothic cathedral half-buried in the sand. The curves of the arches and the materials are strongly reminiscent of Zaltar's work on Argo City.

They have reached the ground floor. Zaltar plucks one of the liquid filled bulbs from the stem of a large plant growing in a niche in the wall. He squirts some of the green liquid in his mouth with great satisfaction.
</DIRECTION>
<ZALTAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I look at them all the time. Every planet in the galaxy. It's quite boring. Here, rub some of this onto that bruise.

He carefully applies some of the green liquid to the wound on her scalp.

<SUPERGIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You look at them? How?

<ZALTAR>

Zaltar sweeps the clutter off the table and onto the floor.
</DIRECTION>

He passes his hand over the table and instantly the table turns into a WINDOW INTO ANOTHER WORLD, showing an image of a herdboy riding on the back of a water buffalo in a rice paddy.
</DIRECTION>
<ZALTAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There you see? What could be more boring than that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZALTAR>

He waves his hand, and the image disappears.
</DIRECTION>
<SUPERGIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait. Could...could I see the place I just came from?
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Zaltar sighs with great martyrdom, and starts to fiddle with his controls.
</DIRECTION>
<ZALTAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It'll only make you sad.

He shows her the proper hand gestures to control the image.

	This goes closer. This moves it around. And this begins.

<DIRECTION>
The roadside complex where Lucy's traffic accident occurred. The Hamburger Place is boarded up. The area is almost deserted and no cars pass on the street. All of the huge advertising billboards along the way are now covered with pictures of Selena. The only writing is in mystic symbols. A lone figure walks furtively along the street. It is LUCY LANE, her face disguised with dark glasses. She goes to the rear of the abandoned Hamburger Place and knocks four times. The door opens quickly and she ducks inside.

INT. HAMBURGER HEAVEN. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The restaurant has been converted into a clandestine print shop. A few serious teenagers are working the press and turning out seditious handbills. Freshly printed pages are hung on clothes-lines so the ink can dry. "THE TRUTH ABOUT SELENA" is the headline over JIMMY'S PHOTO of her getting into the Cadillac with her huge shadow looming behind. Lucy crosses to Jimmy Olsen, who is tying up bundles of handbills.

Jimmy gives her another bundle of handbills. HELMETED GUARDS in the livery of Selena's service kick down the door. and rush in, weapons drawn. They smash up the print shop and arrest everybody. Jimmy and Lucy are handcuffed and dragged away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PRISON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Danvers and all the teenagers from the print shop are crowded into tiers of barred cells set into the walls of a dark, enormous cavern. Jimmy and Lucy huddle together for warmth in one of the tiny cells.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I sure wish Superman was around. He wouldn't let any of this go on. Not for one minute.

</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
There is the clank of an iron door, and Ethan enters the prison with several of the guards in Selena's livery. He walks past the cells, glancing now and then with compassion at the poor wretches inside. Lucy calls out as he passes.

INT. ZALTAR'S HOUSE IN THE ZONE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Supergirl waves her hand over the table angrily, decisively. The WINDOW of the Zone closes, and the image of Ethan disappears. She crosses to Zaltar, who is reclining on a couch in an adjoining room, getting drunk on the green liquid from the plant bladders.
</DIRECTION>
<SUPERGIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Zaltar, please help me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUPERGIRL>
<ZALTAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course, my dear. What can I do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZALTAR>
<SUPERGIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help me to get back to Earth. Where my friends are. They need me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUPERGIRL>
<DIRECTION>
Zaltar looks pained, and takes several deep drinks of green plant sap before he answers.
</DIRECTION>
<ZALTAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's no way out of the Zone. No one's ever escaped. That's why they send the criminals here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZALTAR>
<SUPERGIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If there's a way in, there must be a way out.

</SUPERGIRL>
<ZALTAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, that's not true---there's well...no--
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZALTAR>
<DIRECTION>
He suddenly has an idea, vaguely forming at the back of his drink-sodden brain. He toys with it, while Supergirl leans forward eagerly, waiting. He changes his mind several times about whether it's possible or not, each time changing his facial expression. Supergirl has the feeling she's watching a debate conducted by squints and grimaces.
</DIRECTION>
<ZALTAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is a way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZALTAR>
<SUPERGIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I knew it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUPERGIRL>
<ZALTAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But it's impossible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZALTAR>
<SUPERGIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUPERGIRL>
<ZALTAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it wouldn't work, you couldn't, it's too--- if it didn't work you'd be swept into a singularity--- no, you'd never make it. Forget I mentioned it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZALTAR>
<DIRECTION>
Supergirl's heart sinks. She rocks back, clutching her knees, trying not to show her sadness.
</DIRECTION>
<ZALTAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZALTAR>
<DIRECTION>
She is suddenly all excitement and hopefulness again.
</DIRECTION>
<SUPERGIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then teach me how.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUPERGIRL>
<ZALTAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it's no good---you can't practice--- you only get one go. A thing like that. No. Sure you don't want a sip of this? It's delicious, I think.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZALTAR>
<DIRECTION>
He takes another sip of his drink.
</DIRECTION>
<SUPERGIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me how. to do it. If you could do it, I can.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUPERGIRL>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at her shrewdly, appraising her abilities with a suddenly lucid glance.
</DIRECTION>
<ZALTAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Takes a long time, you know, learning the wand. Just begun to understand it myse1f. Give things a kind of life--can also take away life; works backwards too. Besides I can't let you take my wand. Only have the one, what would I do? I'd be helpless. It's out of the question.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZALTAR>
<SUPERGIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then come with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUPERGIRL>
<ZALTAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leave the zone? What would I do on Earth?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZALTAR>
<SUPERGIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You could do anything. You could sculpt mountain ranges...draw with rainbows! You'd have superpowers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUPERGIRL>
<ZALTAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Superpowers. Got you in a lot of trouble, didn't they?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZALTAR>
<SUPERGIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please. I have to get back to Earth. My friends are in trouble. And unless I bring back the Power Source, Argo City will die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUPERGIRL>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at her kneeling beside his couch, tears streaming down her cheeks, pleading with him.
</DIRECTION>
<ZALTAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, all right. Stop crying. Let's go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZALTAR>
<DIRECTION>
He stands up, takes his matterwand, and heads for the stairs up to the surface. Supergirl can hardly believe her plea has been granted. She runs after him, up the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<SUPERGIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're going to take me back?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUPERGIRL>
<ZALTAR>

EXT. ZALTAR' S HOUSE. PHANTOM ZONE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They emerge from the circular doorway out onto the flat monotonous terrain of the zone. Zaltar pauses for a moment to get his bearings, then strikes out with long energetic strides. Supergirl hurries to keep up with him.
</DIRECTION>
<SUPERGIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I heard my mother ask you once "how could a man with such a selfish heart create beauty?" She was wrong, Zaltar, you have a generous heart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUPERGIRL>
<ZALTAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not doing this for you. Just sick of this place, that's all. Wretched singing sculptures, always yowling at you. Boring!

Supergirl scampers along beside him, smiling. Zaltar never looks back at his abandoned house, but keeps his gaze fixed on the horizon straight ahead.
</DIRECTION>

Ethan is walking down the hall and sees guards dragging Lucy Lane and Jimmy Olsen in chains. Lucy calls out to him.

Selena snaps irritably at him.

Selena doesn't answer, but looks back at the mirror. Ethan moves to her side and watches with her the IMAGE OF THE PHANTOM ZONE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PHANTOM ZONE/QUANTUM VORTEX
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zaltar leads the way, firming their path with the matterwand, and then hauling himself and Supergirl forward over an upward sloping, undulating surface. Behind them luminescent waves of energy can be seen, like the ocean at the base of a steep cliff, constantly sweeping backwards and downwards, away from their goal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SELENA'S NEW LIVING ROOM

Selena looks up and realises Ethan is behind her, looking intently at the image.
</DIRECTION>
<SELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quit staring so hard. You'll strain your eyes.

She puts her hand on his cheek. He turns away from the image of Supergirl and looks deep in Selena's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not going to hurt her, are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
Selena is furious. Her eyes get that dangerous look.

	You can't put her out of your mind, is that it?

EXT. CONSERVATORY. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MR. & Mrs. Danvers, Lucy Lane, and Jimmy Olsen are imprisoned in four metal cages hanging over the reflecting pool in the conservatory. The ropes that keep the cages from falling into the pool are GIGANTIC GOLDEN SERPENTS, their tails around an overhead beam, and the jaws tightly locked on the tops of the cages. A fifth cage hangs there empty. The water in the reflecting pool has changed colour to an opaque yellow. Selena shows the arrangements to Ethan.
</DIRECTION>
<SELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Unless Supergirl agrees to go away forever, the serpents will drop them one by one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SELENA>

Selena puts a small silver whistle to her lips and blows a high, melodious note. The fifth serpent opens his jaws and releases the empty cage into the pool.
</DIRECTION>

The empty cage lands in the water and is instantly eaten up by the most powerful acid imaginable, leaving nothing but froth and acrid fumes. Ethan looks down into the cool at his reflection distorted by the spreading ripples.

<DIRECTION>
Selena steps beside him and puts her hand on his shoulder. Ethan cries out with terror. Selena looks down at what he sees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT: REFLECTING POOL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind Selena, distorted almost beyond recognition by the ripples on the surface, is a GIANT MONSTROUS SHADOW-BEING, ITS ARMS OUTSTRETCHED, ALMOST ENVELOPING HER, but invisible except in reflections.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Zaltar is continuing his climb, but the way is getting steeper, and he is tired and short of breath. He pauses.
</DIRECTION>
<SUPERGIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are you stopping?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUPERGIRL>
<ZALTAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stopping? Was I? Silly. One thing you musn't do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZALTAR>
<DIRECTION>
He continues forward, and upward, firming their path with the matterwand. The wand creates a warm circle of white light around them in contrast to the monochromatic energy field of the Phantom Zone. Because of the inherent curvature of the Phantom Zone vortex, they seem to be scrambling up a sheer vertical wall now. Supergirl is close beside Zaltar helping him along, not merely following as she had before. The throbbing sound of energy waves surging down the vortex is growing louder as they proceed. Zaltar stumbles, and drops the matterwand.
</DIRECTION>
<ZALTAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh dear!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZALTAR>
<DIRECTION>
The vortex starts to sweep the wand backwards, down to where they have just climbed from. Supergirl makes a desperate lunge and retrieves the wand as it sweeps past. But now she is being swept backwards.
</DIRECTION>
<ZALTAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The wand. Use it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZALTAR>
<DIRECTION>
Supergirl somehow finds the right grip on the controls and points the wand at the undulating surface beneath her. She stills the moving surface and stops her backwards motion.
</DIRECTION>
<ZALTAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good girl! That's the way!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZALTAR>
<DIRECTION>
But now Zaltar is being swept backwards toward her. She points the wand at his feet and halts his downhill slide.
</DIRECTION>
<ZALTAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can use the wand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZALTAR>
<SUPERGIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Better than when I was a child.

She hands it back to him and they resume their slow upward progress.

<DIRECTION>
Selena stands watching the image of Zaltar and Supergirl in her mirror. Beside her on the floor is the Coffer of Shadow, now swollen to the size of a large pumpkin. It pulses and glows with inner light. The lid of the Coffer of Shadow starts to rattle as if something inside is attempting to get out.

Flaming spheres of BALL LIGHTNING begin to whizz past Zaltar and Supergirl. Zaltar is startled, and he stops his forward progress.

</SUPERGIRL>
<DIRECTION>
Another flaming sphere whizzes toward them. It hits Zaltar on the shoulder and knocks him off the safe path. He starts to roll backwards down the vortex.
</DIRECTION>
<SUPERGIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Zaltar. Use the wand!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUPERGIRL>
<ZALTAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too late. Too late. Save yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZALTAR>
<DIRECTION>
He is being swept faster and .faster away from her, receding like the image of Ethan when she was trapped in the zone. Zaltar throws the wand to her, and then is swept away, out of sight, downward to his death. He calls out after he disappears.
</DIRECTION>
<ZALTAR>

She begins to be swept backwards, but she uses the wand, and stops her slide. Gripping the wand fiercely, she starts to forge ahead. All the while she has to dodge the flaming spheres that Selena sends down the vortex.
</DIRECTION>
<SUPERGIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not going to win, Selena. I won't let you.

Suddenly Supergirl enters another area of the vortex. She begins to move forward, upward, without clawing her way. She accelerates, moving faster and faster.

Supergirl lands, in a deserted sunny meadow. She collapses sobbing on the grass. The matterwand lies beside her.

She looks up at the sun shining down serenely, bathing the Earth in its life-giving rays---and returning her superpowers to her.
</DIRECTION>
<SUPERGIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wherever you are, Zaltar, thank 'you.
	</DIALOGUE>

She stands up and flexes her muscles. She no longer looks tired or disheveled. Her red and blue costume shines in the bright sunlight. She picks up the matterwand and leaps into the air, flying faster than a speeding bullet.

Huge oak refectory tables, alabaster thrones, marble urns, iron firegrates, shie1ds and armour, bronze statuary, and razor sharp panes of glass from the windows all shatter themselves against her invulnerable body. Ethan stands in the corner, ducking the stray fragments that come his way.
</DIRECTION>
<SUPERGIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've run out of things to throw, Selena.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUPERGIRL>
<SELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not yet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SELENA>
<DIRECTION>
Selena points her hand at Supergirl with a gesture of attack. The COFFER OF SHADOW emits a dense black mist that darkens the room. A giant invisible hand seizes Supergirl and hurls her into the alchemical bar with a crash of bottles. Supergirl stands up with the wand held in front of her to ward off another attack.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's her shadow-self! Her dark side!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<SUPERGIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do I fight it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUPERGIRL>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Turn it against her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
Supergirl raises the wand and APPLIES IT TO HER OWN BODY. THERE IS A FLASH OF BLINDING LIGHT, and Supergirl is transformed into a perfect image of Selena---as she was at the fairgrounds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There are now two Selenas in the room---the real one beside the Coffer of shadow, and the one holding the matterwand in the alchemical bar. The Real Selena is first astonished, and then furious.
</DIRECTION>
<REAL_SELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Power of Shadow, kill her!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</REAL_SELENA>
<DIRECTION>
The Second Selena calls out to the SHADOW-SELF in Selena's own unmistakable voice.
</DIRECTION>
<SECOND_SELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I am your mistress. Do not harm me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECOND_SELENA>
<REAL_SELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't listen to her! Kill her! She's lying.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REAL_SELENA>
<SECOND_SELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are my shadow, you must obey me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECOND_SELENA>
<DIRECTION>
The Real Selena is distracted by the duel of willpower with her double and doesn't notice Ethan creeping along the wall toward the Coffer of Shadow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ethan lunges for the shining OMEGAHEDRON inside, and snatches it out just as the heavy lid slams shut with a clang of metal. Ethan rolls over and over on the floor, away from Selena, clutching the, shining ring to him like a football in the end zone after a quarterback sneak on a fourth down trailing seven to six with three seconds on the clock.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got it! The Power Source!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
The Real Se1ena cries out with despair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then the SHADOW attacks her. The Real Selena cries out as she is surrounded by a black mist that starts slowly choking the life out of her.
</DIRECTION>
<REAL_SELENA>
<DIRECTION>
(terrified)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! Stop! Please!
	</DIALOGUE>
</REAL_SELENA>
<DIRECTION>
Ethan hands the Power Source to the Second Selena in the bar.
</DIRECTION>
<SECOND_SELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you. I'll take this back to Argo City.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECOND_SELENA>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is you, then, really?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
Without a word, the Second Selena kisses him on the lips.
</DIRECTION>
<SECOND_SELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECOND_SELENA>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's you all right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<SECOND_SELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll make it easy for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECOND_SELENA>
<DIRECTION>
She again APPLIES THE WAND TO HER OWN BODY. There is a flash of light, and once more Supergirl stands before him, clutching both the Power Source and the wand.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I couldn't help what I did, before. She drugged me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<SUPERGIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never doubted you for a moment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUPERGIRL>
<REAL_SELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Supergirl. Please! Help! I'm dying...
	</DIALOGUE>
</REAL_SELENA>
<DIRECTION>
Supergirl steps toward the corner of the room beside the mirror where the Real Selena is imprisoned in the cloud of blackness. Supergirl touches the SHADOW with her wand. There is a cosmic musical chord, and the SHADOW is destroyed; it falls to the floor in a rain of hard, dark cinders.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Real Selena rises from the corner of the room where she was released from the grip of the shadow. She looks at herself in the mirror. She is changed into the softer, more innocent person she was at the picnic before she found the Omegahedron. THERE IS NO MORE EVIL SHADOW LOOMING BEHIND HER IN THE MIRROR REFLECTION. She turns to Supergirl and Ethan.
</DIRECTION>
<SELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm free. I can never thank you enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SELENA>
<SUPERGIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUPERGIRL>
<DIRECTION>
Selena points to the glittering OMEGAHEDRON Supergirl holds.
</DIRECTION>
<SELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ever since I found that thing I've been like a prisoner in a terrible nightmare. You have no idea how awful it is to be mean all the time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SELENA>
<SUPERGIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your nightmares are over. I'm taking this back to Argo City where it won't be misused.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Ethan)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You could come too. It might be safer for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUPERGIRL>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No thanks. I have friends in the resistance. They'll vouch for me. I figure I might get a million bucks for my memoirs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<SUPERGIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll come back as soon as I can.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUPERGIRL>
<SELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about me? They'll make, hash out of me around here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SELENA>
<DIRECTION>
Supergirl and Ethan exchange a glance. Selena's innocence is the one problem they have not foreseen.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's right. They'll string her up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<SUPERGIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you want to come to Argo City?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUPERGIRL>
<SELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's it like?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SELENA>
<SUPERGIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the most beautiful place in the universe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUPERGIRL>
<SELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sounds O.K. to me. Let's go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SELENA>
<DIRECTION>
Supergirl holds out the matterwand to Selena.
</DIRECTION>
<SUPERGIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grab hold of this. It forms a force field for the journey through inner space.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUPERGIRL>
<DIRECTION>
Selena grasps the matterwand and the two of them fly together out the French doors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:

<DIRECTION>
INT. PRISON. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Supergirl and Selena fly through the prison. Supergirl melts open the locks with BEAMS OF HEAT VISION.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The prisoners climb out of their cells cheering and rejoicing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT . HAMBURGER HEAVEN. GAS STATION. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All the people of Midvale are enthusiastically chopping up the billboard portraits of Selena and throwing them into a bonfire in the middle of the street. Statues, banners, mystic symbols, giant tarot cards, old uniforms of her palace guards and youth group --every last remnant of her regime joins the blaze. People are smiling, dancing, holding hands, drinking: the atmosphere is like a block party on the first week in spring.
</DIRECTION>

CUT TO:

EXT. HIGH ABOVE THE SEA.

SUNSET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Selena and Supergirl fly over the ocean toward the setting sun.
</DIRECTION>
<SELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is inner space?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SELENA>
<SUPERGIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's everywhere. But water is always the door.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUPERGIRL>
<DIRECTION>
They plunge down into the sun's reflection on the sea surface.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. INNER SPACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Supergirl and Selena fly together through the dark reaches of inner space. Supergirl is tired but triumphant. The OMEGAHEDRON glows brightly in her hand. Selena looks around her with awe and wonder.
</DIRECTION>
<SELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will they be angry with me for stealing the Power Source?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SELENA>
<SUPERGIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They'll be grateful. If you hadn't found it, it would still be lost. Look, up ahead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUPERGIRL>
<SELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I see it. Shining like a jewel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SELENA>
<SUPERGIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUPERGIRL>
<DIRECTION>
P.O.V. OF SUPERGIRL AND SELENA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Argo City floats ahead, seeming to welcome them, its lights, growing brighter and brighter as they return with the lost Source
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT:

<DIRECTION>
THE END
