He leaves the door open. Above him, the tremendous CLANGING noise of CARS POUNDING along the expressway. But he can't see them. He can only hear them and feel their vibration. He stands there a moment, taking in the strangeness of the place and of his own situation -- the tire, Maria, his wife, his life. A little chill of lone- liness hits him. He shakes it off and walks to the tire -- a simple, inevitable move toward a destiny he could never have imagined.

Sherman is confused. He doesn't move. Maria gets behind the wheel of the car. Roland reaches slowly into his jacket pocket. He smiles and keeps moving toward Sherman. Sherman sees the hand moving out of the jacket pocket. He is still frozen. Maria BLOWS the HORN. Sherman wakes up finally.

	Your Honor, the District Attorney, Mr. Weiss...
	</DIALOGUE>
<JUDGE_WHITE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know who the district attorney is. I know Mr. Weiss. And the only reason Mr. Weiss is interested in the case is because Mr. Williams over there is a white man who lives in a nice big house in Riverdale.
	</DIALOGUE>
<KRAMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't follow, sir...
	</DIALOGUE>
<JUDGE_WHITE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because this is an election year. Because ninety-nine percent of the people you shovel through here are black and the other ninety-nine percent don't even speak English. But they do vote. So Mr. Weiss, your boss, the District Attorney -- who dreams every night that someday he is going to be mayor of New York City -- what he needs is a white man. He needs to find him, book him, and throw him in jail. Then he looks good to everybody. The press likes it, the voters like it, even your mother will like it. You follow me now, Mr. Kramer?
	</DIALOGUE>
<KRAMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Your Honor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRAMER>
<JUDGE_WHITE>

	No. See, you're thinking about grades and honor students and high achievers. We don't make those kinds of comparisons. We're just trying to keep them off the street. At Ruppert High, an honor student is somebody who comes to class and doesn't piss on the teacher.

<SHERMAN>

	Because a car is going to take us six blocks and wait there for five and a half hours and then drive us another six blocks home and it is going to cost us three hundred and forty-six dollars?! We are hemorrhaging money, Judy. It is pouring out of us with every beat of our heart. Isn't that worth talking about?!?

Judy sits down and thinks.

<SHERMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Well. You have a point.

<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, yes. And we're doing a little profile piece. We're calling it the 'New Tycoons.' And, naturally, we thought of you.

<ARTHUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... But the best is just a few weeks ago, one of these jackass pilots, he lands long and the plane goes off the runway. I was there. I was on the plane. We're going into Mecca, see. And the plane is full of Arabs and all these animals -- sheep, goats, chickens. They won't travel without their animals. We had to put plastic in the cabins. You know, they urinate, they defecate...
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ARTHUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyway, the plane goes off the runway and we hit the sand with a hell of a jolt and the right wing tip digs into the sand and the plane skids around in a circle! 360 degrees before we stop! We're scared shitless. Panic. And we look into the cabin and there's everybody calm, quiet, they're picking up their luggage and their animals and they're looking out the window at the little fire that started on the wing and they're waiting for the doors to open like nothing happened. And then it dawns on me. They think this is normal!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to laugh as he talks.
</DIRECTION>
<ARTHUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They think this is the way you stop an airplane. You stick one wing in the sand and you spin around until you stop.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(coughing as he laughs harder and harder)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do they know? They never rode in an airplane. They think this is how you do it!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Peter tries to laugh with Arthur. But Arthur's coughing turns into a spasm. He pushes his head back against the banquette. He seems to be humming. And then his head drops forward and he slumps against Peter.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Arthur? Arthur?
	</DIALOGUE>

</JUDGE_WHITE>
<DIRECTION>
The courtroom explodes. Screams fill the air -- "Racist! Peckerwood! Pussyface! Motherfucker!" etc. The sound is deafening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sherman and Killian shake hands. The demonstrators are chanting, "Justice! Justice! Justice!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - DOORS OF COURTROOM
</DIRECTION>

burst open. Reporters and photographers rush into the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - WHITE
</DIRECTION>

rises on the bench like an eagle. He pounds the gavel repeatedly.
</DIRECTION>
<DEMONSTRATORS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Justice. We want justice!!! We want justice!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
<JUDGE_WHITE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Justice! You want justice?! I'll give you justice!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, the courtroom goes quiet. White looks around. Everyone is quiet. And then a single VOICE rings out...
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You racist pig!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEMONSTRATORS>
<JUDGE_WHITE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You dare call me a racist! Well, I say to you, you -- a mob who dares to come into these walls -- I say to you, what does it matter ... the color of a man's skin? If witnesses perjure themselves... and a prosecutor, a sworn officer of the court, enlists the perjurers ... and a district attorney throws a man to the mob and lawyers carve up that man for his money... and men of the cloth, men of God take the prime cuts! Now you tell me -- IS THAT JUSTICE?!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Silence.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't hear you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<DIRECTION>
More silence. He comes down off the bench, facing the mob.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll tell you what justice is not. Justice is not the will of the few and it's not the will of the many. Justice is not politics. Justice is the law. And the law is man's feeble attempt to set down the principles of decency. Decency! And decency is not a deal. Or an angle, or a contract, or a hustle or a campaign or a trick or a bid for sympathy. Decency is not the beast that bays for money, power, dominion, position, votes and blood! Decency is what your mother taught you! Decency is in your bones! Do I make myself clear! Now go home. Go home now. Be decent people. Be decent.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A moment of quiet as White comes down and faces Sherman.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - HENRY LAMB - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
lying in his bed. Perfectly still. And then his nose twitches. His hand comes up and scratches his nose. His eyes open. He sits up, looks around, figures where he is. He gets out of bed, disconnects the I.V.

EXT. HOSPITAL - HENRY LAMB
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
