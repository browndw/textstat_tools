A dirty-blondish tenement KID of eleven, clad in a blend of cast- offs and hand-me-downs; her version of street punk chic. She totes a skateboard under one arm (itself a berserk Jackson Pollock chaos of band stickers, silver marker and graffiti, with day-glo wheels), and transfers her impromptu bouquet so she may unzip a flap and hike up a ragged hood against the rain. She stops to watch the grave diggers pack up and EXIT b.g.

It blinks in its alien way.

TIGHT CLOSE-UP A FRAMED 8X10
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thinly filmed in dust, mounted among dozens of other band shots. Visible among the posed members of a group called Diabolique is Eric, wielding guitar on the club stage. ND BLUR as people CROSS FRAME.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRANGE, 45-50, powerful, a seasoned assassin, cruel but loyal. His facade remains stony as he leads three other men briskly down the corridor.: NGO NWA, 50ish, clad Chinese gangster style - white topcoat, white scarf, tinted shades - and two body guards supplying a power perimeter around him,lean, dark-haired Asian killers who would gladly die for Ngo Nwa, which they will in just a minute.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They have just passed the Diabolique 8X10. Ngo Nwa's gloved fingers, in passing, leave little skid tracks in the dust that clear the eyes of Eric in the photo.

As the foursome reaches the DOOR, Grange turns doubtfully -- suspiciously -- to Nwa.

INT. LAO'S NIGHTCLUB OFFICE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door CLOSES and the BG NOISE is GONE. Through a large window (mirrored on the club side) all sorts of activity is visible through automatic mini-blinds. A fly-vision bank of 12 TV monitors is hot with surveillance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LAO, a painfully clean-cut, Armani-clad Asian, impeccable, almost dashing, but the dynamic here is crystal clear: Nwa is the King: Lao, the dark prince in this hierarchy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the desk, Lao is startled from his contemplation of a tiny, perfect rat skeleton by Ngo Nwa's unheralded entry. The desktop is bare except for and Arcane Vietnamese fighting knife, half a meter long with an ideogrammed blade, dramatically positioned beneath an Artemide lamp. Lao rises and feigns servility.

NB: The following exchange will play FAST, and entirely in VIETNAMESE.

<LAO>
<DIRECTION>
(phony assuagement)
</DIRECTION>
<NWA>
<DIRECTION>
(knows it's bullshit)

<DIRECTION>
Lao turns, staring out the blinds, fighting for control. Deep breath. He turns back to his "master." Nwa gestures broadly at the oppulent office, indicating that Lao should be grateful, but is somehow errant
</DIRECTION>
<NWA>
<DIRECTION>
(respect is required)
</DIRECTION>
<LAO>
<DIRECTION>
(begrudging agreement)
</DIRECTION>

Lao sees the blade. An idea. He lifts it reverently, bears it the Nwa hilt-first in both hands, as if bestowing a thing of immeasurable worth.
</DIRECTION>
<NGO_NWA>
<DIRECTION>
(why give me this?)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nonetheless, Nwa accepts the blade. It gleams. Hypnotic. Even Nwa has to admire it. Turns it so the blade is pointed at his sternum. His attitude indicates Lao is too far away to do anything untoward.
</DIRECTION>
<LAO>
<DIRECTION>
(sinister punchline)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lao spins through the air and HEEL-KICKS the blade THROUGH Nwa's chest, pinning him to the door. It's over so fast the gasp of astonishment never escapes Nwa. Lao is much more than merely treacherous, he is extremely capable.

Eric, wearing the combat boots, climbs as the crow leads him. Up. He jams his hand on a rusty wedge of metal. Ouch.

Blood flows from the gash. He vises his fist shut.

Eye-to-eye with the crow. Opens his hand.

CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S PALM

The blood flows back into the wound, which closes itself, leaving another scar.

ETC. GIDEON`S PAWN SHOP - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the T-Bird grumbles tp park curbside. Menacing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GIDEON'S PAWN SHOP - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A junkyard of loot and dusty discards. Junkie thievings and other people's stereos. Behind a wire-meshed security counter GIDEON reads a racing form, chain-smoking throughout the scene. He is pear-shaped, stubbled, unkempt. Food on his shirt. JINGLE of doorbells. Gideon lowers his paper to reveal Skank and T-Bird on approach.
</DIRECTION>
<GIDEON>

	Ahhh, jesus, the creatures of the night, here they come. Tweedledum and Tweedledummer.

<GIDEON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatcha got?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIDEON>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE - COUNTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Transaction time. T-Bird passes items through the screen slot and Gideon gives each one cursory, doubtful inspection.
</DIRECTION>
<T_BIRD>

	Coupla more rings... 24k.

<SKANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wouldn't want Top Dollar not to smile.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKANK>
<DIRECTION>
Mention of Top Dollar clams Gideon efficiently up. He hands over the cash to T-Bird with a grimace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROOFTOP - ON ERIC - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric stares upward at the crow as it drops like a bomber from the night sky, flying past him, skimming the roof, leading him on. Eric exhales, shrugs, feeling mocked by the bird.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>
<DIRECTION>
And he takes off on a run. Only to stumble and fall. But the falls turns into a TUMBLING ROLL that lands Eric back on his feet still moving. He looks back as if to ask: "Did I do that?" and runs out of the frame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE - PICKING UP ERIC ON THE RUN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as he squints towards the crow and does his best to keep up. TRACK WITH HIM to the edge of the roof, heavily misted in rain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He jumps a negligible gap to the next lower roof. The next roof-top is a one-story jump down. Eric clears the jump with a WOOF of air. Keeping his eyes on the flying crow; gaining strength. His next leap is more like a broad-jump. Athletic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FAST MOVING ANGLE - THE CROW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
keeping airborne, keeping ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVING ANGLE - ERIC
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eyes confidently on the sky as he arches out into space...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UP ANGLE FROM STREET - BUILDINGS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Eric is seen to jump across the gap at least three stories up where there is no connecting building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ANGLE - TARGET BUILDING LEDGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Eric smashes into it, just missing, hinging at the waist, grabbing for purchase, suddenly panicked, gravity pulling him downward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - AT ERIC FROM PHONE CABLE BRACKET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric falls but manages to grab the bracket one-handed. He hangs for another deadly moment, then slowly, to his own astonishment, executes a one-handed pull-up that will save his ass.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gotcha.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He completes the pull-up, bringing his chin level with the ledge. As he reaches for it with his other hand the bracket rips from the wall and Eric plummets, with a howl of defeat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UP ANGLE FROM STREET - ERIC'S DOWNFALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a looooooong way down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - ALLEYWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Eric lands and splits a trash can in two. A beat as we wonder if any bones are left unpulped. PUSH IN as Eric rolls from facedown to his back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT SHOT - ERIC'S FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as he completes the roll, gasping, amazed he's still in one piece.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - TRASHCAN - ON THE CROW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It flies easily down to inspect Eric as he slowly sits up, examining his hands. Frustrated and pissed off.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks.

EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

Still, dark silence until Eric lands from ABOVE FRAME, feline. The crow lands simultaneously b.g., perched near a roof access door with a shaded, dim-yellow bulb.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE-UP - THE CROW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It just blinks at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ABANDONED STAIRWELL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Eric yanks open the rusty rooftop door from the outside and sweeps down the steps in a swirl of night mist
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - FOOT OF STAIRS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trash and detritus all around, clogging the arteries of the building, which is old, unoccupied, forsaken. The crow lights on a scarred banister knob. Eric's footsteps come down into frame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON LOFT DOOR - INCLUDE ERIC
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A year ago this door was sealed with police barricade tape... which now sags, faded.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sticker across the jam notifies potential trespassers that this is -- was -- a crime scene. Eric slows, stops, his hand on the banister.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - THE CROW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as is wafts ahead of Eric, arriving at the door first.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S HAND ON BANISTER sliding along, as he speaks, until it hits a cigarette burn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PUSH IN ON ERIC - TIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stiffening as he suffers his second --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASH: IMAGES and DIALOG are not linked. A rapidfire MONTAGE set in the loft, a year earlier (it is decorated for Halloween). The broken door. The stairwell is filled with cops and cop noise; lab guys bustle. Albrecht is there, making notes as a DETECTIVE steps over to him.
</DIRECTION>
<ALBRECHT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Victim's name is Shelly Webster. The guy who got tossed is, uh ...--

Albrecht grinds out his smoke on the banister.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASH ENDS.

RESUME ERIC ON THE STAIRS.

He sits down hard, hurting from the flash. His eyes seek the crow. He completes Albrecht's line:

LOW DOLLY of Elly's little combat boots moving toward the entryway of the pit. MUSIC gradually UP LOUDER O.s. as she nears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - ELLY IN DOORWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luridly-lit. A grown-up's place. A burly BOUNCER appraises her, his tone jokey. He knows Elly.
</DIRECTION>
<BOUNCER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! You got any ID?

The Bouncer jerks a thumb. Go on in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE PIT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A grungy sawdust-floored shot-and-beer joint packed tight with urban BURNOUTS rushing to drink their lives away. Hammering MUSIC and rude whorehouse lighting. Each predator straining to be badder than the next.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRACK THROUGH this maze at Elly's eye level until we reach DARLA, waitressing her heart out, the drug mileage on her obvious.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mom --?

RACK PAST Darla and MOVE IN CLOSE on a corner table -- where sit Funboy, Skank, T-Bird and a black, vested muscle gypsy, TIN-TIN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOFT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Eric shoves the door open from the outside. The lock, popped from the frame, spins on the wooden floor. The barrier tape whisps and dust roils. Dark, chilly, damp. A rat's nest of disuse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULL BACK THROUGH THE BROKEN PICTURE WINDOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Eric enters. Glass blown out. Shards poking. Jagged.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE - AS ERIC WALKS IN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He scans the loft. Sees reflecting golden eyes near the floor.

<DIRECTION>
ERIC'S POV - FLOOR NEAR WINDOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A white, long-haired cat walks into a pool of night light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
He kneels. Extends his hand. The cat nears; likes Eric.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S HAND.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the cat makes contact. Sudden white jolt - a FLASH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASH: we HEAR Eric strumming his Strat o.s. We see what he saw: Shelly, holding the cat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASH ENDS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UP ANGLE - ERIC
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wincing. Recovering from the flash. He purposefully gathers the cat into his arms and braces for more, harder, stronger...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASH: A MAN and a WOMAN make love on a big bed amidst a hundred points of candlelight. Shelly and Eric, once upon a time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASH ENDS.

They all crack up laughing like ax murderers. Skank drinks, Tin-Tin spot checks the satchell from Top Dollar's. Darla delivers more shots and funboy feels her ass.

FLASH: Shelly spills into frame, mouth bloodied. T-Bird instantly on top of her, rough.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASH ENDS.

as he abandons the outline and staggers to the window... where he cuts open his hand on jags of glass.

FLASH: Eric held firm in the grasp of T-Bird and Funboy, one arm each. Five bloody bullet holes in Eric's chest.

<DIRECTION>
FLASH ENDS.

Reeling backward, same trajectory as in the Flash, but toward the floor, in SLO-MO. Overloaded. Blacking out.

AS ERIC FALLS - INTERCUT MONTAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A jumble of good/bad images from the loft: Tin-Tin embedding a page of paper in the loft wall with a throwing knife... Shelly's face as she lights a candle... a POPPING champagne cork... the echoing CANNONADE of the shots that killed Eric... Skank backhanding Shelly...

He pulls the nickel plated revolver from the satchel. FOLLOW as he hands it across to RATSO, who removes the suitcase-sized boom box (the source of the music) from his shoulder to accept. Ratso is a feral skull-head; street trash.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOFT, BEDROOM - NIGHT (LATER)
</DIRECTION>

Shelly's vanity. Dusty, disused. The mirror spiderwebbed with cracks but still hanging precariously in its frame. Eric is seated, his image crazily split into many. He pulls on a long- sleeved, tight-knit, black shirt.

RESUMING ERIC AT VANITY

his face a crazy warpaint maze of white streaks, not blended yet. He looks at his own reflection. In one cracked, triangular facet of the mirror is not a multiple of his face, but the Skull Cowboy. Just one.

He smears the streaks until his face is uniformly grave-wave white.

	<DIALOGUE>
	HEY!!

And he hustles to close up the distance between himself and the door, gun up. Before he can touch the door, the crowbar comes rocketing through the glass, pegging Gideon in the forehead and knocking him flat on his ass. He loses the pistol. Eric walks through the door, causing the fractured glass to disintegrate around him. He disclaims, thespian.

During Gideon's rant, Eric brushes glass cubes from his shoulders, nonplussed. Now he flings Gideon across the room.

<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>

As Eric comes up behind him, Gideon reaches through the open cage door and pulls a big combat knife from beneath the counter.

Dozens of gold rings. Eric's fingers sift through them.

He closes his fist tightly around the ring. A moment of decision. Then he draws the shotgun from beneath the counter. Uses the butt to knock the knife free of Gideon's hand. It goes spinning across the countertop. Eric shucks the shotgun and rams it into Gideon's nose as the big man slumps to the floor.

SMASH! as another tin ceases to exist next to Gideon. Then Eric is gone, past him without further word, ignoring him entirely. As he exits, shotgun shouldered, he pauses to admire a white Fender Strat hanging among the pawnables. He reaches for it.

Funboy lashes out and broadsides Eric across the temple with the gun. Eric falls, rolls back to a stance, but Funboy is right on top of him, howling like a lunatic and pistol-whipping Eric relentlessly.

ANGLE - WALL NEAR BATHROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Eric, caught off-guard by Funboy's hyper high and weakened by his wound, comes slamming into the wall, losing his footing. Here comes Funboy, and we TILT UP from Eric's position as he looms, cocking the pistol, which now has Eric's blood on it.
</DIRECTION>
<FUNBOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ahh, the hell with it, I still got five shots left.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FUNBOY>
<DIRECTION>
In a blur, Eric grabs Funboy`s gun hand. Twists to the crunching of bones. Funboy's skewed-around gun hand blows a hole in his own thigh. Funboy fall back across the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<FUNBOY>

	Owwwaaaa -- fuck me! Look what you did to my sheets, you lame piece'a shit! AAAAaa! Goddd!

Eric sits on the bed next to Funboy; inspects the ampule of morphine on the nightstand, the needle of the syringe already inserted.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have some pain killer right here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>
<DIRECTION>
And he fills the syringe all the way.

<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON FUNBOY

as he begins to see the light. He can't get away. Growing terror.

	Your pain ends now.

</ERIC>
<DIRECTION>
And Eric rams the needle into Funboy's heart, driving home the full dose. Funboy begins to convulse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric falls back on the bed, his force spent. Darla COMES TO in the corner, shock-traumatized. On O.S. COUGH, and Eric opens his eyes.

</SKULL_COWBOY>
<DIRECTION>
The Skull Cowboy seems saddened or disappointed. All we get is a little shake of his skull-head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Darla makes a SOUND and Eric turns toward her. She's really confused. She's looking to Eric for some kind of answer.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your daughter is out there, on the street, waiting for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>
<DIRECTION>
She's stunned, utterly speechless. All she can do is look in Eric's eyes, try to ponder the phantoms there.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go. Now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>
<DIRECTION>
Darla shoves helter-skelter past Eric and out the door without a glance back at Funboy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric, recovering, follows slowly, staring at the open door, stooping to lift the guitar dropped during the fight with Funboy. The Skull Cowboy has vanished. PUSH IN. Grimly, Eric takes a syringe and begins to draw blood from the late Funboy.

ANOTHER ANGLE - GRANGE

Understandable nervous, Albrecht lights up a cigarette.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - SKULL COWBOY (EFFECT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the force of the storm dust-devils around him and begins to disassemble him. The fire in his eye sockets goes out. His hat flies off an is pulverized by the wind. The garments begin to disintegrate and blow around, rotten cerements falling apart in mid-air.

TIGHT ANGLE - ERIC ON STEPS

He has time to register the dust in his palm before it, too, renders down to nothingness, leaving a vague green glow that dies. And as he looks to the sky --

INT. CHURCH - AS ERIC COMES THROUGH THE DOORS - NIGHT

Then he's ducking bullets himself as Albrecht STEPS IN through the blown out window, the machine gun stuttering on slugs.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON PEW -- ERIC DIVES just as Guard #4 comes after him with the sword, which chomps into the wood and gets stuck there. Guard #4 releases it and cross draws his Calico as ERIC springs back into the frame -- STRAIGHT UP.

Lao SNAPS Elly's free handcuff to the dimly glowing lightning rod and advances, one foot on either side of the peak of the roof, his blade brandished.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE MOVING SHOT - ERIC -- Hands up to grapple, but weaponless. He spiders to meet Lao, suddenly PICKING UP SPEED and RUNNING along the precarious peak.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lao sees him coming, braces to strike, but Eric executes a BROAD FLYING LEAP right over Lao's head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ERIC LANDS, SLIPS, sprawls sideways, clinging to the peak of the roof. Lao hurries in to slash with the blade, as Eric averts. The steel RINGS. Eric converts his dodge into a low spin kick that DUMPS Lao.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric SPREAD-EAGLES to keep from falling. Distantly, Lao similarly saves himself.
</DIRECTION>

The aforementioned grey day in the city.

ANGLE - DARLA AND ELLY AT THE WINDOW.

Darla comes up. Arm around Elly. Cheer up; he attitude much more connected and loving. PUSH IN ON ELLY so we know she is clutching SHelly's ring tightly in her hand. Darla looks past Elly, out the window.
