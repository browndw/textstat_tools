:SC: EXT. MAIN STREET, SMALL TOWN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A freight truck of late 1950's vintage pulls to the side of the road in a small rural town. A handsome, well-built man gets out of the passenger side and thanks the Driver. THE NEWCOMER carries his coat over his shoulder and a beat-up suitcase; he's got a jut jaw and a modified pompadour, his shirtsleeves are rolled all the way up past his biceps. He wipes his brow against the sweltering heat and looks around. [Until noted below, this section of the movie is in BLACK & WHITE.]

	<DIALOGUE>
	I get outta the truck in this two- bit town. I got no money and no prospects. What I need right now is a stiff drink, a cold shower, and a hot broad. I'll take 'em in any order they come...

:SC: EXT. BOARDING HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Old three story gothic house in ill-repair beyond a peeling picket fence and a scruffy yard. The sign says -- ROOMS TO RENT. The Newcomer goes in the gate.
</DIRECTION>
<FOLLETT>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Oh yeah, one other thing I need -- an angle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLLETT>
<DIRECTION>
He squints through the dirty screen door but sees nothing, then knocks and turns away to survey the neighborhood.

	I was thinking -- if it weren't for bad luck, I wouldn't have any luck at all...

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I help you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDLADY>
<DIRECTION>
The Newcomer turns toward the door. Standing there, holding the screen open, is the LANDLADY. She's a knockout in a cheap, small-town way: a cotton dress that buttons down the front and clings with sweat to her generous curves.
</DIRECTION>
<FOLLETT>

<DIRECTION>
The Newcomer's POV of the Landlady as she leads him up the narrow, gloomy stairs from the second floor to the third story / attic. She has a Monroe-like sway to her walk. We can barely HEAR her DISTANT, ECHOEY DIALOGUE:
</DIRECTION>
<LANDLADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...not very fancy... house needs repairs... We haven't had a man around here for so long...

(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She kept yammerin' the whole time, but her hips were doing all the talking...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLLETT>
<DIRECTION>
The Landlady reaches the tiny landing at the top of the stairs and opens a door to a squalid room with a bed, bureau and tiny window. The Newcomer has to squeeze by her voluptuous body to get inside and look around. It doesn't take long. His gaze returns to the Landlady who is leaning against the door, chest thrust forward. He focusses on her fingers, toying with the button at her sweat-shiny cleavage.

	It couldn't 'a been any clearer what the set-up was. The next move was up to me...

<DIRECTION>
We see Mumford's office: the office of a Psychologist, a therapist with a doctorate. It's modest, comfortable, neat, with a calm, relaxed ambience. [The movie is now in COLOR.] His patient, HENRY FOLLETT, looks nothing like The Newcomer in the soft-core fantasy he's been narrating. Instead, he's a mild-looking pharmacist with glasses and a receding hairline. Only the voice is the same; it's as studly as his fantasy alter-ego. Follett has been lying on a couch, but now has twisted with some irritation to look at Mumford.

Lunch crowd. Mumford can be seen out the big front window, crossing from the two-story building that houses his office on the main drag of this small town which, oddly enough, is also called Mumford. He comes inside and goes to the counter to pick up some take-out. The Proprietor is a woman around forty named LILY, who talks to him as she works.

Lily sees something out the window.

<LILY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at that guy...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LILY>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford turns to look out the window. A young man of about 30, in jeans and a Hawaiian shirt, is skateboarding down the street at high speed, weaving in and out amongst the cars. He zips past the front of the restaurant.
</DIRECTION>
<LILY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know who that is, don't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Mumford does not)

	You really don't? That's Skip Skipperton, man. He gets himself hit by a truck, this whole town shuts down.

	Oh, so that's him? The Panda Man.

An overweight, teenage girl named NESSA WATKINS is on Mumford's couch. She fidgets as she talks and can't decide whether to lie down (so she's looking away from him) or sit up and face him. She plays with an unlit cigarette and keeps taking out a lighter, then stuffing it back in her big, sloppy handbag.

But while the scar is still healing, or whatever you call it when you have a tattoo removed, he meets Chandra. And it's serious, immediate love. So in no time, he's gone from the most gorgeous model in the world to the most gorgeous actress in North America.

The last rays of sun are fighting their way through the trees as Mumford comes up the trail he clearly knows very well.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. BIG ROCK LOOKOUT POINT - MAGIC
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford climbs out on the Big Rock, settles himself on the edge and takes a long drink from a water bottle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHAT HE SEES: far below at the foot of these hills, lights just twinkling on, is the town of Mumford. He stares at it for several long moments. Then he takes a small headlamp from his pack and fits the straps over his head (it looks like a miner's light). He twists the light on to test it and turns his head to watch the beam move about.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE CUT BACK WIDE. After a beat, Mumford settles back and turns off the light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. SCATTERGOOD'S TAVERN - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
The place is quietly busy with the regulars. Mumford has a favorite spot at the far end of the bar. Right now he's sitting alone, reading the remnants of a newspaper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SKIP SKIPPERTON, the man on the skateboard, comes in. Everyone in the bar is surprised to see Skip in here. Several patrons greet him as he makes his way deeper inside, looking around. He's uncomfortable. He seems relieved when he spots Mumford and heads back there. Mumford doesn't notice Skip waiting for his attention.
</DIRECTION>
<SKIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKIP>

Mumford looks up, smiles. Skip offers his hand.

	Fine. Okay. Pretty good. I've been hoping we'd meet. I've heard a lot about you.

CUT TO:

LATER. IN A BOOTH near the back. They've been at it a while, but nothing is clear to Mumford, yet. Skip keeps his voice down; he doesn't want anyone else in the bar to hear him.

<DIRECTION>
Skip stares into his beer for a moment, as though the thought depresses him. He catches himself and snaps back --
</DIRECTION>
<SKIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So now we make 23% of the modems in the market, which is pretty good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKIP>
<DIRECTION>
Skip glances around, leans in, confidential.
</DIRECTION>
<SKIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When I was growing up here, the town was about dead. The timber business was played out... Panda changed all that. Now, just about everybody in town either works for the company or depends on it somehow. Which is kinda the problem...

</SKIP>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford waits, watches. Skip gets uncomfortable.
</DIRECTION>
<SKIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you like another beer?

Skip heads off to the bar. Mumford looks around. Everybody is watching.

DISSOLVE TO:

LATER. The bar crowd has thinned. Both Mumford and Skip have had a few. In fact, Mumford is now carefully pouring them each another drink from a bottle of Glensomething on the table.
</DIRECTION>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want me... to be... your friend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
Skip beams. Mumford leans forward in the same confidential way Skip did before; he indicates that Skip should lean in too. Mumford is almost whispering --
</DIRECTION>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But that's not what's really going on...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Skip is excited)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...What's really going on is... you have some problems and you want some therapy, but you feel it could be very bad for Panda Modem stock if word got out that you were having head problems.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
Skip confirms that's it.
</DIRECTION>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I ask you a personal question?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<SKIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course! That's exactly what I want.

</SKIP>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you thought about getting a wife?

</MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
Skip makes a face and gesture to indicate a large "YES!", but also total frustration and failure.
</DIRECTION>
<SKIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When Panda started to happen, I was dating women from New York, San Francisco, L.A. They came out of the woodwork. Models, actresses, venture capitalists... These were not the kind of girls who were interested in me before I hit it... And you know what I discovered? I discovered these girls did not love me for myself. The majority of them didn't even like me. But a lot of them would've gladly become Mrs. Skipperton for a while. Can you imagine that -- marrying someone just because they've got money?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKIP>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford considers that.

<SKIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I gotta pee.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Now here's the question -- Your name is Mumford, too.

</SKIP>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that the question?

<SKIP>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Far out.

<DIRECTION>
Skip takes a few steps toward the men's room, then comes back and leans down toward Mumford.
</DIRECTION>
<SKIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope you don't think I want you to do this for free. Just because we're gonna play it like we're friends, doesn't mean I won't pay you like a doctor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKIP>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I understand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<SKIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have a lot of money. Do you know how much money I've got?

</SKIP>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't tell me, 'cause I'm not going to tell you what I've got.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<SKIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got three big ones.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKIP>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm impressed. I couldn't make three million dollars if I lived three lifetimes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<SKIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no... I have three billion dollars.

Skip stumbles off to take a leak. Mumford takes a moment to digest that. It's difficult.

Mumford is listening to Lionel, the arrogant lawyer who asked about him in the restaurant. Lionel is lying on the couch, talking with enormous energy; he has a serious superiority complex. Mumford can't stand him and the session seems to be lasting an eternity.

</LIONEL>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford's head rocks slowly back for a moment as if he's going to drift off. He snaps back to life and stares hard at the top of Lionel's head, where there is a bald spot starting to take hold. The sound of LIONEL'S VOICE begins to echo --
</DIRECTION>
<LIONEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...which is no problem for me, because I remembered it was coming and I've attended every class, so I'm totally prepared. Then I see myself running down the hall at school...

A boy, unmistakably the Young Lionel, runs down the deserted hallway toward a bright doorway. [LIONEL'S DREAM has a BLUE TINT.]

Young Lionel comes breathlessly in the classroom door and stares alarmed.

	<DIALOGUE>
	And even though I arrive a little bit early, everybody's already there. But the surprising part is --

WHAT YOUNG LIONEL SEES: Everyone in the class, including the Teacher in the front, is naked. The Teacher holds out an exam toward Young Lionel.

:SC: INT. WAITING ROOM, MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALTHEA BROCKETT, a woman in her forties, sits on the couch reading a mail order catalogue for home furnishings. There are several other catalogues sticking out of her jammed, woven carry-all.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door to Mumford's inner office opens with some force. Mumford stands looking back across his office at Lionel, who is getting up from the couch in some confusion.
</DIRECTION>
<LIONEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- you crazy? You can't do this!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIONEL>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure I can, Lionel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<LIONEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a criminal lawyer -- you think I like my clients? I can't stand most of them! But I don't kick them out...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIONEL>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See that sign -- We retain the right to refuse service to anyone. I'm not going to charge you for this session, but I don't want to see you back here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
Lionel looks around, but there is no such sign. He does spot Althea watching the show from the couch.
</DIRECTION>
<LIONEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you at least have a back door I can use?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIONEL>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come out this way. There's no shame in getting a little therapy... is there, Althea?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
Althea stands up, smiling. She thinks Mumford is the bee's knees.
</DIRECTION>
<ALTHEA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not at all. It takes guts, Lionel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALTHEA>
<DIRECTION>
Lionel steams by them in a black mood.
</DIRECTION>
<LIONEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe some of us don't need this crap!

</LIONEL>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And it's the Hubble Telescope, not the Himball Telescope.

Lionel bangs out the front door. Mumford motions Althea inside --
</DIRECTION>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jeez... what an asshole.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
Althea heads inside, giggling wildly. She can't get enough of this guy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE -DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Althea is sobbing. Mumford hands her a new Kleenex from the box next to the couch. She wads it with her current one and tries to stop crying. Mumford settles back in his chair, patient.
</DIRECTION>
<ALTHEA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do they want from me?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(more sobbing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What have I done that's so wrong?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pulling it together)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They act as though they don't have their own peculiar things... They do! Believe me. Everybody's got something...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looks at Mumford)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Even you probably have things.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALTHEA>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me more than most.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<ALTHEA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are they ganging up against me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALTHEA>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not sure. But I think they're worried about you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<ALTHEA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the kids, you know, not Jeremy. He had nothing to do with this -- except pay, of course. He's always willing to pay. He's extremely generous.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a long beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm so humiliated that my own children would threaten me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALTHEA>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did they threaten you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<ALTHEA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They said if I didn't get help, they wouldn't deal with me any more.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beseeching look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you think about that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALTHEA>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good kids.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
Althea stares at him a long moment. She knows he's right. Tears well up in her eyes and roll down her cheeks. She grabs another Kleenex. In the midst of the torrent she tries to talk, but it's undecipherable:
</DIRECTION>
<ALTHEA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mmmmfffstttubll abbittmm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALTHEA>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hmm?

</MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
Althea uses three new tissues to dry up her face.
</DIRECTION>
<ALTHEA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said... you must come out to the house for dinner on Thursday.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALTHEA>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? You think so?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<ALTHEA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Jeremy will be home for the weekend. And you can meet the kids.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALTHEA>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford considers, then nods his assent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. MUMFORD'S STREET - MAGIC
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford hurries up the sidewalk carrying two grocery bags. He's late. The modest houses are close together on this pretty street, which rises out of the main business district, seen beyond Mumford.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. THE DUPLEX HOUSE - MAGIC
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford comes to the house where he lives. He heads down the driveway toward the stairs that lead up to his apartment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The front yard is completely fenced. Lily, the owner of the restaurant, is almost visible in there working among the greenery of a lush garden. Her friendly dog, AINGE, sees Mumford, leaps easily over the fence and does a circle around Mumford, who has no free hand to pet him.
</DIRECTION>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How ya doin', Ainge? Evenin', Lily.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<LILY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doc.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(doesn't look up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ainge...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LILY>
<DIRECTION>
The dog leaps gracefully back into the yard. Mumford hurries up the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. MUMFORD'S APARTMENT - MAGIC
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford comes in and puts the bags down on the kitchen counter. He goes directly to the table by his main chair and picks up the TV remote. He switches it on and changes the channel. The opening segment of UNSOLVED MYSTERIES is just beginning. It previews the stories on that evening's episode -- disappearances and unclosed cases -- with Robert Stack hosting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON MUMFORD'S FACE as he watches. Only when the whole show has been previewed does he seem to relax. He leaves the show on as he goes into the kitchen and begins unloading the bags.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. COOK'S HARDWARE STORE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford is comparing different stepladders. MR. COOK, the sixty-ish proprietor, has been watching from a distance, but now --
</DIRECTION>
<COOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Mumford.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOK>
<MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
(doesn't really know him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Cook.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<COOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could you come with me please?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOK>
<DIRECTION>
Mystified, Mumford follows Cook through the door into the back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK OF THE STORE. Cook motions for Mumford to take the seat of honor in the work area, but Mumford prefers to stand. Cook has a little trouble figuring how to start. Finally --
</DIRECTION>
<COOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know I shoulda come to your office. I was gonna, actually, but then when you walked in here today...
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOK>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh-huh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<COOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's my daughter Sofie... she's gotta problem.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOK>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<COOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're not sure. She's been to all kinds of doctors in the city and they've said different things. Some of 'em are callin' it --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(wants to get this right)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Epstein-Barr virus, and the rest are callin' it... Chronic Fatigue Symptom...
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOK>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Syndrome... Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<COOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's it -- syndrome. So you know all about it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOK>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No... a little. There's a lot of debate about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<COOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I got that. Some people think it's all in their heads.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(more intense)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's been so bad she's had to move back here to Mumford and live with us. And I'm not sure that's the best thing, either...
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOK>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<COOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh... a lot of things. Several different factors. Will you see her, Doctor Mumford?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOK>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. Why don't you bring her up to my office at 3 tomorrow afternoon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
Cook nods, but looks worried.
</DIRECTION>
<COOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not sure she'll come. She's in a mood. Do you ever go to somebody's house?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOK>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Generally that doesn't work out so well. It sends the wrong message to people who need to make a change.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
Cook is quick to agree; he doesn't want to make waves. But he's worried.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford is walking up the busy sidewalk carrying his new 5- foot stepladder hooked on his shoulder. Folks greet him. Suddenly Lionel appears in front of Mumford, who stops.
</DIRECTION>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Lionel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<LIONEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've got to have the right ladder for the job. You don't know what you're doing, you can get yourself in trouble.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIONEL>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're right, as usual. See you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford continues up the street. We STAY WITH Lionel, who watches Mumford with a sour look, then turns to enter a small medical building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. DR. DELBANCO'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DR. ERNEST DELBANCO, a middle-aged psychiatrist with longish, vanity hair, and PHYLLIS SHEELER, a psychologist in her thirties, sit on the doctor's comfortable furniture, listening. The remains of their take-out lunch is on the coffee table. They seem a little impatient with their as-yet- unseen visitor --
</DIRECTION>
<LIONEL>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...completely inappropriate and highly unprofessional. Now I don't want to presume to tell you how to run your businesses --
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIONEL>
<SHEELER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- practices.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEELER>
<DIRECTION>
Lionel is sitting across the room, making an ardent case --
</DIRECTION>
<LIONEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Whatever. Six months ago, you two were the only games in town. The value of your...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(mocking)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	..."practices" could be seriously undermined by this bozo. A town this size has only so many headcases to go around.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIONEL>
<DELBANCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What exactly would you have us do, Lionel?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELBANCO>
<LIONEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Protect your turf! Check this guy out. I smell a rat, I tell you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIONEL>
<DIRECTION>
Delbanco and Sheeler exchange a look; they find Lionel distasteful.
</DIRECTION>
<SHEELER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Dillard, I'm sure Dr. Delbanco shares my gratitude for your concern. But I also know he'd agree that you misunderstand the nature of our calling to mental health. We're not in some... widget business, trying to crush our competition.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEELER>
<LIONEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell's a widget?

Lionel comes out of the office, miffed, and goes down the stairs. A moment later, the door opens slightly and Delbanco peeks out to make sure Lionel is gone. He closes the door on us.

:SC: EXT. BASEBALL DIAMOND - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Idyllic. The beautifully manicured field is surrounded by lush woods. Standing about forty feet apart, Mumford and Skip are alone on the field throwing a baseball back and forth. For quite a while the only sounds are the birds, the wind, and the regular SLAP of ball into glove. Finally --
</DIRECTION>
<SKIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is great!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKIP>
<DIRECTION>
SLAP... SLAP.
</DIRECTION>
<SKIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is exactly what I wanted.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKIP>
<DIRECTION>
SLAP... SLAP.
</DIRECTION>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Skip, you must have lots of people you can throw a ball with.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<SKIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'd be surprised. Most guys have kids or wives or girlfriends. They're busy. It's not as easy as you think.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKIP>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Skip, you're the head of the whole deal here. Are they busier than you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<SKIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you know... that's the thing. Like I said, just about everybody in town works for me. And it's just not the same asking someone to throw a ball when they work for you. It's like an order or something... And no one -- no one -- asks me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKIP>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford considers. SLAP... SLAP... SLAP.
</DIRECTION>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, would you say we're out here... let me think how to put this... Is your problem really that you're... lonely?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<SKIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you like this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKIP>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hell yes, I like it. What's better than this? Most guys would kill just to have someone do this with them whenever they like.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<SKIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay then.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Good-looking woman.

</MUMFORD>
<SKIP>

(sparks to that)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? I'm the only person I know that likes Danny Ainge, outside of Celtic fans. Maybe Phoenix.

</SKIP>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, there's Lily.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<SKIP>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</SKIP>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Amazing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<SKIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Unbelievable...

	<DIALOGUE>
	...And Lily named her dog after him? Far out.

</SKIP>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What kind of person do you have to be to do this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford gestures off in the one direction we have not yet seen.
</DIRECTION>
<SKIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKIP>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This --

<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE ANGLE: The baseball diamond is sitting in the vast, lush grounds behind the PANDA MODEM WORLD HEADQUARTERS, a brand new, distinctively original, high-tech office park. Wherever there is an opportunity for tasteful signage, it is in the motif of a Giant Panda -- sweet white face, black eyes and ears, round body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Skip is suddenly self-conscious, embarrassed.
</DIRECTION>
<SKIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would've traded any of it to have made the Mumford High varsity.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKIP>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford takes that in. SLAP... SLAP.
</DIRECTION>
<SKIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So I guess Henry Follett is a patient of yours. He's my pharmacist.

</SKIP>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(SLAP... SLAP)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guy's got some serious sex fantasies.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
Skip is a little surprised to hear this from Mumford, but he just throws the ball.
</DIRECTION>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pretty good, too. Lots of detail. Nothing hard core. Old-fashioned ones, from back when people cared about atmosphere and character.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<SKIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh-huh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKIP>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Problem is, his fantasy life's a lot better than his real one. Nothing can live up to it. His wife got sick of it and left him. Took his kids with her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<SKIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wondered what happened to her...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKIP>
<DIRECTION>
Skip is fascinated, but a little uncomfortable. Mumford seems oblivious, unusually talkative --
</DIRECTION>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course, it's not that simple. There's something powerful going on there. We've got a lot of work to do.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(announcer voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's hit to the warning track!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
For the first time, Mumford throws the ball way high, like a long fly ball. Skip, delighted as a dog, takes off running and just barely catches it on the run. He pegs it back to Mumford.
</DIRECTION>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In these fantasies, Henry Follett is played by a handsome guy with biceps. Can you imagine that? Where your self-esteem has to be?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(throws him the ball)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Man, I'd just like to move the guy to the point where he gets to appear in his own fantasies.

:SC: INT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. Nessa sits staring at Mumford defiantly, an unlit cigarette in her mouth. Mumford looks at the clock -- 3:00 -- and stands up, session over. Nessa quickly lights her cigarette with the lighter concealed in her hand and stands up too. She exhales a huge cloud of smoke and walks quickly to the back door of the office, which Mumford has opened for her, and goes out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford waves half-heartedly at the cloud of smoke as he walks to the door to the waiting room and opens it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MUMFORD'S POV: As the door swings open, the first figure we see is Mr. Cook; he twists around at the sound of the door. He acknowledges Mumford and then sighs as he steps aside to reveal, sitting exhausted in a chair, his daughter --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOFIE -- a young woman whose actual appearance is somewhat disguised at present by her wan, ashen visage. She regards Mumford with some resignation. Her father helps her out of the chair. Sofie keeps her eyes on Mumford.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON Mumford, watching her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY

LATER. Mr. Cook is gone. Sofie is sitting up on the couch, facing Mumford. She looks like she might pass out at any moment, but her voice is stronger than you'd expect.

	Feel free to lie down. Most people do.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, lord. It's almost too exhausting to tell you...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(tiny smile, to herself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...about my exhaustion. I didn't really want to come. I'm not hopeful right now. But I couldn't take the look on my dad's face. He's a truly kind person, which is pretty extraordinary if you knew the story. He's the opposite of me, I guess -- all stamina and resolve.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIE>
<DIRECTION>
It's taken all her energy to say this and she sinks down a bit into the couch.
</DIRECTION>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When did you start to feel this way?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<SOFIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	About six months ago, I guess it is now. God, it seems like years. What a bore! I'm embarrassed by it. Before this happened -- when I'd hear people talk about this kind of thing -- I thought it was a bunch of bullshit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIE>
<DIRECTION>
She sees something in his face and suddenly laughs -- it's a weak but magical sound.
</DIRECTION>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<SOFIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think that now! You think it's a bunch of hooey, don't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIE>
<MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
(unconvincing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<SOFIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I saw it. I saw it in your eyes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIE>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford is knocked off balance -- she's right. She saw him clearly.
</DIRECTION>
<SOFIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's okay. Maybe it is. My mother always says -- "Everything that's wrong with you is in your head." I suppose that's true.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIE>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Back when this started, was there anything unusual happening in your life? A change of job, of living situation... a loss of some kind?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<SOFIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No... but it started one year to the day after my divorce became final. That's not too suspicious, is it?... But it wasn't like I was feeling bad about the divorce. Just the opposite.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIE>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hmm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<SOFIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hmm? Is that a professional opinion?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIE>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hmm, as in -- that's interesting. Sometimes, with enough clues, it's possible to figure these things out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<SOFIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Even if you don't think it's real?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIE>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know what's real and what isn't. That's never been my strong suit. But if you're tired all the time and you've had to give up the life you were having and come back home when you didn't want to... that's worth trying to fix. Maybe I can help you do that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<SOFIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What would you do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIE>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We... we would try several things. But I need to see you a lot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<SOFIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. I barely made it today.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIE>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll come to you. We'll try a little walking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
Sofie suddenly looks defeated.
</DIRECTION>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll take it slow. You'll never feel you can't handle it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<SOFIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think I can afford it. I don't want my dad paying.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIE>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll work it out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
Sofie gives him a long look.
</DIRECTION>
<SOFIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have the best answer for everything.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Mumford shrugs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You seem so... hopeful. Are you always this sunny?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIE>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No one ever thought so. You must bring it out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<SOFIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it contagious? 'Cause everyone agrees my immune system's way down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIE>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe you'll catch it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<SOFIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I ask you something?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Mumford: of course)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't you tell my dad you didn't think it was a good idea to come to the patient?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he admits it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what changed?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIE>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford just smiles. He doesn't want to tell her the truth -- everything.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. BROCKETT HOUSE - MAGIC
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A taxi drops Mumford in front of the Brockett's large and beautiful house, which sits on an isolated lot on the outskirts of town.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. HALLWAY TO BACK VERANDA, BROCKETT HOUSE - MAGIC
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Althea leads Mumford toward the back of the lavishly appointed house. The weird thing, what gets in the way of the decor, is the cardboard boxes of all sizes which are stacked everywhere. Many are unopened, but the rest are spilling their styrofoam-nugget and bubble-wrap guts to reveal some hint of their contents: a huge variety of catalogue-ordered housewares, clothing, linens, gadgets, and knickknacks. If it can be ordered from an upscale catalogue (and everything can), it is here. Althea sounds very nervous, cheery.
</DIRECTION>
<ALTHEA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- sorry everything's in such an uproar. Lots of big occasions coming up, and of course Christmas is only eight months away --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(giggles uncontrollably)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- I don't know what's keeping Jeremy. You know he stays in the city three nights a week -- I guess I explained that...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Mumford nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I know Katie's here, but I'm not so sure about Martin... I'm making dinner myself tonight, so I'll have to leave you, I'm afraid...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALTHEA>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. REAR VERANDA, BROCKETT HOUSE - MAGIC
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They come out onto the wide porch, which commands a spectacular view of the surrounding countryside. There's an elaborate bar cart out here, which Althea points Mumford toward.
</DIRECTION>
<ALTHEA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm awful I know, but will you please help yourself. I just got a new copper sauciere from Williams-Sonoma and I'm afraid it'll be the death of us all if I don't get back in there...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALTHEA>
<DIRECTION>
She disappears inside with a bang of the screen door. Mumford gets a drink for himself, taking in the view. He sees something out there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MUMFORD'S POV: Way in the distance, coming out of the woods and down toward the house is a teenage boy.
</DIRECTION>
<KATIE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're the doctor, aren't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATIE>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford turns to see that Althea's thirteen year old daughter KATIE has silently appeared. Her jeans and little tee-shirt are meant to be sexy; it seems sad on her. Mumford nods.
</DIRECTION>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must be Katie. People call me Doc.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<KATIE>
<DIRECTION>
(motioning urgently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mere. Quick... c'mon!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATIE>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford follows as she disappears around the corner of the porch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. SIDE HALL, BROCKETT HOUSE - MAGIC
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford follows Katie into a gloomy hall from a side entrance. Here too, the walls are lined with boxes. She tiptoes to one of two facing doors and waits for him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When he has joined her, she motions him back a foot for safety, then carefully opens the door to a large walk-in closet. Katie's caution becomes understandable: the space is packed so fully and chaotically with catalogue item cartons that it might come tumbling out the door with one careless move. Katie closes the door, then pirouettes to the opposing door, which she swings open freely -- REVEALING: what was once a study is now completely filled with hundreds of cartons, in an infinite variety of shapes and sizes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford is taken aback. Katie points at packages and speaks in a hypnotic WHISPER --
</DIRECTION>
<KATIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cuddledown... Linen & Lace... Scully & Scully... Smith & Hawken... Plow & Hearth... Museum of Modern Art... Smithsonian Museum... J. Crew... Wolferman's... Hold Everything... Nieman Marcus... Coldwater Creek... Garnett Hill... Norm Thompson... Victoria's Secret... Sharper Image... Hammacher Schlemmer...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATIE>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. REAR VERANDA, BROCKETT HOUSE - MAGIC
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just as Mumford and Katie come back around the corner, MARTIN, Althea's sixteen year old son, crosses the yard and comes up onto the porch. He's wearing an old black leather jacket with a lot of zippers, dirty jeans and black Converse All- Stars that are coming apart. In his hand, casually but properly held, is a .22 caliber rifle. He looks Mumford over.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<KATIE>
<DIRECTION>
(nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I showed him.

</KATIE>
<MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
(to Mumford)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you get it now? This is no joke.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford takes them both in and nods. He understands. Suddenly, their manner changes, for the worse. What they can see that Mumford cannot is JEREMY BROCKETT, Althea's husband, who has come to the back screen door, with the bustle of a late arrival.
</DIRECTION>
<JEREMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, kids. Oh, hi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEREMY>
<DIRECTION>
Seeing Mumford, Jeremy steps out onto the porch to shake his hand. Jeremy is quite handsome and a fantastic dresser; his Armani outfit cost $4200 all in. His tone: hearty and strained --
</DIRECTION>
<JEREMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must be Dr. Mumford of Mumford. Jeremy Brockett.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEREMY>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doc. Nice to meet you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<JEREMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry I'm late... traffic was a motherfucker. Have another drink, I'll be back in five.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEREMY>
<DIRECTION>
Jeremy goes inside. Martin and Katie exchange a look with each other, then to Mumford. Martin goes inside.
</DIRECTION>

:SC: EXT. REAR VERANDA, BROCKETT HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LATER. Dinner is over. Jeremy comes out onto the veranda carrying two Cuban cigars. His casual outfit is as stylish and pricey as his work outfit. He joins Mumford and Althea, who immediately gets up.
</DIRECTION>
<ALTHEA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALTHEA>
<DIRECTION>
She goes inside. The men each have a snifter of cognac. Jeremy makes a ceremony of cutting the cigars --
</DIRECTION>
<JEREMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you'll like this. Know much about Cuban cigars?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEREMY>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nope.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
Jeremy puts the cigars down, pulls a joint out of his cashmere pullover and fires it up. After exhaling a huge cloud of smoke, he offers the joint to Mumford, who declines.
</DIRECTION>
<JEREMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Makes the whole thing that much better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEREMY>
<DIRECTION>
Jeremy takes another hit on the joint and puts it down. He gives a cigar and his gold lighter to Mumford, who begins to light up --
</DIRECTION>
<JEREMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just hold the flame a little bit below the end... that's it... now just turn it slowly as you draw...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEREMY>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford does as he's told. Jeremy lights his own cigar.
</DIRECTION>
<JEREMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you a man who likes to treat himself right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEREMY>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've had my moments.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<JEREMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am. And I'm not ashamed of it. Nobody ever said on their death bed -- "I treated myself too well."
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEREMY>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought it was -- Nobody ever said, "I should have spent more time at the office."
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<JEREMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fill in the blank. I don't mind the office. The point is, you only go 'round once. Like the Zens say -- Be here now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEREMY>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you do?

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've been talking about her, mostly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<JEREMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, in '85 four of us left our firms and formed an investment banking venture. We've got twenty-three people working there now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEREMY>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've done well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
The marijuana is kicking in now -- Jeremy gets a self- satisfied, condescending look on his face that no straight mind would dare. His response includes their lavish immediate surroundings--
</DIRECTION>
<JEREMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've done... very well. You know anything about addiction, Doc?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEREMY>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A little.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<JEREMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'm addicted to winning. I say when you're in the red zone, you gotta score.
	</DIALOGUE>

(watches Mumford smoke)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what do you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEREMY>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tastes good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<JEREMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No... I mean about Althea. About her...

	...behavior. Do you think you can fix her up?

</JEREMY>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you think's wrong with her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<JEREMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's gone weird is what's wrong with her. Out of control. Probably from living out here in Mayberry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEREMY>
<DIRECTION>
Jeremy blows cigar smoke into his snifter, then takes a mouthful of cognac, savoring the sensations. Mumford watches, fascinated by this guy.
</DIRECTION>
<JEREMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're the doctor, what do you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEREMY>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She seems very unhappy.

Jeremy gives him a look, as if to say "duh."

Mumford knew that.

	It doesn't bother me anymore. It's my dad and my brother I worry about.

</SOFIE>
<MUMFORD>

	Something's bothering her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<SOFIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, we've all disappointed her. Me, especially, but Dad, of course. She thinks my brother's all right, but she didn't expect much. It's what happens when you "marry beneath yourself"...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIE>
<DIRECTION>
Sofie suddenly seems to be fading.
</DIRECTION>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please... forgive me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<SOFIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIE>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Negative thinking makes everything more difficult. If you're going to have enough strength to do this, we have to talk only about positive things. All right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him, unsure if he's serious. It seems so corny. But she agrees.

<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay then... Are you positive your mother's a bitch?

ANOTHER DAY. Mumford is leading Sofie through the lightest set of calisthenics ever devised. Now they're doing waist bends and arm waving. Even so, it's taking everything Sofie's got.

<SOFIE>

	I don't know if I mentioned the headaches.

(Sofie: yes)

	<DIALOGUE>
	But you get more now? Or more severe?

</MUMFORD>
<SOFIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, not really. They're about the same. My marriage was one long headache.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIE>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So the headaches may not even be a part of this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>

She considers that, reluctantly agrees.

<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can give myself a headache instantly.

<SOFIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that like a party trick?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIE>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All I have to do is have two conflicting thoughts at the same time... Like I'll think -- 'Taking these walks is going to help Sofie get better.' But then I'll also think -- 'Mumford, you just enjoy taking these walks and you're kidding yourself about the benefits.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
Sofie's not sure how to take that. She looks away.

:SC: INT. BOARDING HOUSE (IN HENRY FOLLETT'S FANTASY) - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The handsome Newcomer of Follett's fantasy comes down the steps from the attic wearing a sleeveless undershirt, towel thrown over his shoulder. He goes into the bathroom off the second floor hall and begins to wash up. [Again, Follett's fantasy world is in BLACK & WHITE.]
</DIRECTION>
<FOLLETT>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The town was a rube's heaven, but I found work my first day out down at Old Man Sutter's gas station and diner. I knew his stacked young wife was going to be a problem, but, hey, life is full of problems. Back at the boarding house, I was washing up when I heard a load of yellin' and --
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLLETT>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE BATHROOM MIRROR, the Newcomer's POV: a nubile teenager, 17 going on 35, in a tight cheerleader's outfit, comes up the stairs and stops at the top to turn and yell back down at her mother. Her dialogue distant and echoey:
</DIRECTION>
<LANDLADY_S_DAUGHTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...get off my case! You don't like any of my friends...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDLADY_S_DAUGHTER>
<FOLLETT>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I got my first look at the landlady's daughter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLLETT>
<DIRECTION>
The LANDLADY'S DAUGHTER looks up and sees the Newcomer watching her through the half-open bathroom door. She gives him a petulant, white-hot look, then turns on her heel and goes into her room at that end of the hall. She bangs her door behind her, but it bounces open again about a foot. The Newcomer, still watching in the bathroom mirror, now has a view of the bureau mirror in the Landlady's Daughter's room. In there, seemingly oblivious, the girl quickly strips off the top of her outfit, revealing a '50's-era white bra.
</DIRECTION>
<FOLLETT>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lucky for me, she was plenty upset but not too careful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLLETT>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, in mirror reflection of mirror, the Landlady's Daughter meets the Newcomer's smoldering stare and her lip begins to curl.
</DIRECTION>
<FOLLETT>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or maybe it wasn't an accident at all --

	Mr. Follett.

</FOLLETT>
<MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Henry!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
Mysteriously, the door to the girl's bedroom slams shut, cutting off the Newcomer's view. He looks with surprise into his mirror -- it suddenly shatters.
</DIRECTION>

:SC: INT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY

Follett sits up abruptly on the couch and twists toward Mumford, agitated.
</DIRECTION>
<FOLLETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLLETT>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop now.

</MUMFORD>
<FOLLETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why? I'm paying for this.

	Not for this. Not me, you're not.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You find it distasteful, don't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLLETT>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It doesn't matter how I feel about it. It's how you feel about it that matters.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<FOLLETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I enjoy it. Does that make me some kind of pervert? Just because a man has a rich imaginative life --
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLLETT>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't come to me because you have a rich imagination.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<FOLLETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLLETT>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You came because it's taking over. You're in its grip.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<FOLLETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never said that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLLETT>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford's tone suddenly picks up a touch of steel.
</DIRECTION>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's your wife, Henry?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
Follett flinches, settles back down onto the couch, sulking.
</DIRECTION>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's your wife, Henry?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<FOLLETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go to hell.

<MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
(softer)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't hear you.

Follett mutters something to himself, then is silent until --
</DIRECTION>
<FOLLETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We got divorced.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(petulant)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had to get rid of her. She couldn't satisfy me.

</FOLLETT>
<MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
(shouts, Follett jumps)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
Follett seems to shrink in size. They've been here before and he doesn't like it.
</DIRECTION>
<FOLLETT>
<DIRECTION>
(softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was... never satisfied.

</FOLLETT>
<MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
(normal again)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now we're back on track.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
Again, Follett says something under his breath.
</DIRECTION>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that?

Mumford strides up the trail on his late day excursion. He comes around a bend and is surprised to find Skip waiting for him, looking serious.

	Hey, Skip.

</SKIP>
<MUMFORD>

	That's all right. What's on your mind?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford indicates that Skip should walk with him up the trail.
</DIRECTION>
<SKIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How many sessions have we had now, Doc?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Mumford tries to remember)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Six. And it's been good... like we were two buddies hanging out. Just shootin' the shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKIP>
<MUMFORD>

Mumford and Skip come out of the trees, climb onto the big rock, and settle down. The sun is falling over the town of Mumford.
</DIRECTION>
<SKIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...We're like friends, almost... who trust each other.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKIP>
<DIRECTION>
He checks Mumford's reaction. Mumford nods, offers Skip water, who turns it down. Mumford takes a swig.
</DIRECTION>
<SKIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to tell you something, Doc, but before I do, I need to ask you a question... Because, for me to tell you this thing -- well, I haven't told anybody about this. It's the biggest secret I've got.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKIP>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sometimes it's best to keep a few things just for ourselves.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<SKIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a shrink, Doc. Aren't I supposed to be able to tell you everything?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKIP>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's just a thought.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
Skip, even more unsure now, looks away, at the town below.
</DIRECTION>
<SKIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That really relates to the thing I want to ask you... I've noticed that sometimes, not a lot, but sometimes, when we're hanging out, throwin' the ball... or that time we went bowling... sometimes you'll like --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(gets it out fast --)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- tell me things about your other patients.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKIP>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford lets that hang a few moments, then acknowledges it silently. Now Skip is even more nervous.
</DIRECTION>
<SKIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, maybe that's all right! I don't know all that much about psychology or therapy or... ethics, so maybe there's something I missed... or something...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKIP>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're concerned that maybe I can't be trusted with a secret.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<SKIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I trust you. Definitely. No question. But, yeah, I'm a little concerned. I mean, you're not supposed to tell anyone about your patients' problems... are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKIP>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford looks at Skip for a long moment.
</DIRECTION>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That is correct, Skip. I'm going to have to take a long look at that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
The conversation seems to end there. Skip's not sure where to go next. Finally --
</DIRECTION>
<SKIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, well... what I was gonna tell you --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKIP>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Skip. Knowing what you do about me --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<SKIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doc, I trust you! You've listened to me better than anybody... maybe ever.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(leans in, intense)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And this secret I've got, I can't stand it anymore. I don't know if I'm some kind of --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKIP>
<DIRECTION>
Skip looks around at the darkening woods, though clearly there's no one around.
</DIRECTION>
<SKIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- I don't know if I'm a pervert or what. It's taken me this long to get where I can come out and say it... I can't back away now. I can't spend another day not knowing if I'm nuts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKIP>
<DIRECTION>
Skip closes his eyes for a second and gathers himself.
</DIRECTION>
<SKIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, I'm just gonna tell you, as simple and direct as I can.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(one last spasm of doubt)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you understand that this is a big secret? Just between us?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Mumford does)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. You know I've got this gift for certain kinds of... machines.

</SKIP>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are Panda, monarch of modems.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<SKIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right. And you also know that even though I make 23% of the modems in the world... I cannot make one simple connection with any woman who could truly love me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKIP>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay... let's say that, for now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<SKIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's true, believe me. So... do you know what I've been doing, all alone, in my workshop, for almost two years?... Mr. Find-the-Need-and-Fill- It. How I spend my every solitary hour?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKIP>

Mumford shakes his head, "no."
</DIRECTION>
<SKIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guess.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jerking off?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<SKIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!... Although that's a good guess. No, what I've been working on, what the world really needs and no one has been able to create --
	</DIALOGUE>

(leans in, whispering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- a virtually life-like, humanoid, gender-specific, anatomically functional... sexual surrogate slash companion.

Mumford tries to put that all together. Finally --
</DIRECTION>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Slash what?

</MUMFORD>
<SKIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sexual surrogate... slash... companion.

Mumford considers that a long time, watching as the sun finally sinks below the horizon. He looks back at Skip.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You meant -- like a trade secret?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<SKIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Doc, a private secret! It's perverted, it's pitiful. What am I -- Dr. Frankenstein? Aren't you repulsed?

It's getting dark fast now. Mumford reaches into his bag and takes out the headlamp we saw earlier. He fits the straps carefully over his head.
</DIRECTION>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Skip, that's not much of a secret.

</MUMFORD>
<SKIP>
<DIRECTION>
(hurt)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKIP>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, it's okay. It's just not something to be ashamed of. Maybe you don't want people knowing -- and believe me, it's safe with me -- but on the scale of dirty little secrets, I'd give it, say... a two.
	</DIALOGUE>

Mumford twists the headlamp and the light shines out in the dusk. Mumford turns the beam directly at Skip.

The cramped interior is grimy and depressing. MUMFORD'S MOTHER worse for wear, has just put a glass of liquor on the sink and returned her attention to the smoking stovetop. She glances briefly at Mumford and greets him pleasantly, clearly drunk. Suddenly, her attention shifts and we -- PAN TO THE FRONT DOOR which is opened roughly by MUMFORD'S FATHER, a coal miner whose face still shows the grime of his work. But it's his scary scowl that impresses. His eyes take in his wife (and her drink) but he says nothing.

	What none of us down at the Service knew was that Edmond Worrell had a story too... Worrell's was that he'd been fighting chronic depression for thirty years. Under the heat of the investigation, he fell off his medication. One Tuesday morning, he went down to the factory early, wrote his family a letter, then used the 9mm automatic they kept there to kill himself... The DM dropped the case that day and started proceedings to get rid of Gregory...

Mumford and Sofie are delivering newspapers in lovely first light. Mumford has a canvas sack full of newspapers around his neck.

She motions him in and starts to follow. Mumford makes a "what about me?" sound. Lily, grinning, just points to the sign and leaves Mumford standing on the sidewalk.

<DELBANCO>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Mumford.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELBANCO>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford turns to find Dr. Delbanco and Phyllis Sheeler, the shrinks Lionel had conferred with, standing nearby. It takes a moment for Mumford to remember Delbanco. Finally, shaking hands --
</DIRECTION>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Delbanco. It's nice to see you again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<DELBANCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think you know Dr. Sheeler. She's the other therapist here in town.
	</DIALOGUE>

<MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
(shaking her hand)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course... I've heard great things about you.

</MUMFORD>
<SHEELER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.

</SHEELER>
<DELBANCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You never got back to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Mumford doesn't understand)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I called to say we'd like to take you out for a meal?... Kind of a professional welcome.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELBANCO>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford makes a show of remembering.
</DIRECTION>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forgive me, please. What a gracious thought. We must do that.

</MUMFORD>
<SHEELER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When?

The other two nod in unison. Mumford considers, trapped.

:SC: INT. THE LANTERN AND THE LAMB RESTAURANT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The town's upscale dining spot. Mumford, Delbanco and Sheeler are in a red leather booth. Sheeler listens with rapt, admiring attention as Delbanco speaks --
</DIRECTION>
<DELBANCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...annihilation anxieties engendered by bad experiences with a depriving mother... but no one can escape the fear of death. It is, as Henry James put it, "the worm at the core." Try as we may to forget or ignore our mortality, James said --

(theatrically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- "the skull will grin in at the banquet."
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELBANCO>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford nods appreciatively. (He really is an extraordinary listener.) Delbanco catches his own vanity in Sheeler's adoring gaze and becomes self-conscious --
</DIRECTION>
<DELBANCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've run on. Forgive me. We're here to talk about you.

<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My mentor was an amazing teacher named Benton Mandlebaum. Died quite tragically in the collapse of a gazebo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<DELBANCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I've heard of him... a disciple of Rothberg, wasn't he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELBANCO>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford's response, and all that follow, is calm and pleasant.
</DIRECTION>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's possible. I don't know about that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<SHEELER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I suppose your extended training was at an institution in that area?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEELER>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lots of institutions. My graduate advisor believed we should experience as many environments as possible -- prisons, clinics, half-way houses. For a while I was chief therapist in a shopping mall. Had a little spot next to the yogurt place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<DELBANCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Interesting approach. What was his name?

<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dorothy Fowler. Fantastic woman. She passed last year in a train wreck. Damned Amtrak.

</MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
Delbanco and Sheeler exchange a look. Sheeler adopts a "casual" tone --
</DIRECTION>
<SHEELER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I trained in the east, myself -- Cornell -- and I don't care what anyone says, there really are regional differences. I found the state certification exams out here quite harrowing... Did you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEELER>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yeah, very tough. But I guess that's good... to keep out the quacks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<SHEELER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which examiner did you have? I probably know him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEELER>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wallace Franklin... from Greensburg.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
A dark look comes over Sheeler's face for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<SHEELER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was a terrible thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEELER>
<MUMFORD>

	We're interested in any new therapies. How would you characterize your approach?

</DELBANCO>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My approach?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<SHEELER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes... your particular approach.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEELER>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't have one really. Most of the time I'm faking it. See, I think there's not much that can be done about most problems... they're too complicated, too deep-rooted by the time I hear about them. The most I can do, usually, is look and listen real closely, try to catch some glimpse of the secret life everybody's got. If I can get a sense of that, well then, maybe... just maybe, I can help them out a little.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford sits back, considering the couple across the table. His gaze is so crystalline that, after a moment, they become uncomfortable and steal a glance at each other. Finally --

	Uh-huh. What are they?

	Oh, all the great writers -- Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Moby Dick... those people. Each is bound in genuine premium leather with 22 carat gold accents. It's a magnificent set -- and only $33.50 per volume. Right away you get Great Expectations for just $6.99.

(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One hundred books?

</MUMFORD>
<ALTHEA>

</ALTHEA>
<MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>

Althea is sitting on the couch facing Mumford. She has a bulky knit cardigan sweater hugged tightly around her -- the only sign that she's not completely calm.
</DIRECTION>
<ALTHEA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We argued on Sunday. He went to work on Monday and stayed in the city during the week, like always. But on Thursday, when he normally comes home, he didn't. Didn't call either. Not till Saturday afternoon.

<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must have been concerned.

<ALTHEA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's happened before.

	I'm shocked by how little I'm feeling. I can't understand it.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll probably have a complete depressoid collapse soon, won't I?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALTHEA>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doubtful. What did he say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<ALTHEA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He said he wasn't coming back. He said it wasn't working for him any more. That it hadn't "worked for him" for quite a while... You know what I regret the most? I'm sorry I let him make the kids take his name. He was an acquirer.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off Mumford's look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He liked to acquire things.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALTHEA>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford looks away. Althea realizes what he's thinking.
</DIRECTION>
<ALTHEA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think that has something to do with my problem? Ordering all those things?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALTHEA>
<DIRECTION>
It hadn't occurred to Mumford, but it's an interesting thought.
</DIRECTION>
<ALTHEA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Like I was on some kind of campaign to out-acquire him...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(excited now, playing it out)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...If I was just an acquisition to him, and he lost interest once he had me --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALTHEA>
<DIRECTION>
She stops, shakes her head.
</DIRECTION>
<ALTHEA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That can't be it. It's too simple. And besides, I still like it. This morning I ordered a marble turtle cheese board from The Horchow Collection.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(an odd look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I tell you something just awful? You know how people who are just assholes will sometimes look at a woman who's got problems and say, "What she needs is a good shtupping!"?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALTHEA>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford nods.
</DIRECTION>
<ALTHEA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, there may be something to that. Jeremy didn't keep up his end -- Oh, what difference does it make?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(suddenly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do I feel elated? Am I in denial? You know what it feels like?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALTHEA>
<DIRECTION>
She glances at her watch, then starts talking fast --
</DIRECTION>
<ALTHEA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know my time's up, but I've got to get this out while I've got hold of it --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALTHEA>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take your time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<ALTHEA>
<DIRECTION>
(no slowing down)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- When I was in high school, the thing I wanted most, when I was stuck in class, the thing I was always desperately in pursuit of -- was a hall pass. That's all I wanted. I loved moving freely around the school while everybody else was trapped in there... And that's how I feel right now... Like I have some giant, all- day hall pass.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALTHEA>
<DIRECTION>
She is beaming, but suddenly becomes self-conscious. She stands up abruptly, flushed.
</DIRECTION>
<ALTHEA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My god, did it just get hot in here or what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALTHEA>
<DIRECTION>
She takes off the bulky sweater and bends to pick up her purse. She is wearing a simple cotton dress that buttons up the front and hugs her body. WE SEE for the first time what all her other outfits have hidden: Althea has a terrific, voluptuous figure.
</DIRECTION>
<ALTHEA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See you next time. I'll probably be a basket case by then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALTHEA>
<DIRECTION>
She heads toward the door to the waiting room. Mumford indicates the back door.
</DIRECTION>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can go out there if you like...

	<DIALOGUE>
	"There's no shame in getting a little therapy", right, Doc?

She opens the door to the waiting room, startling Henry Follett, who jumps up from a chair out there, magazine still in hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. WAITING ROOM, MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Follett is embarrassed to be discovered here. But that's secondary to the impact Althea's current appearance -- sexy body framed in the doorway -- is having on him. She's been a customer in his store, but he's seeing her now as if for the first time. All his libidinous buttons are being pushed. Althea breezes by, oblivious to his reaction.
</DIRECTION>
<ALTHEA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Mr. Follett. Have a good session. Bye, Doc.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALTHEA>
<DIRECTION>
She goes out.
</DIRECTION>

But Follett continues to stare in the direction Althea has gone.

Mumford is being escorted across the spectacular atrium by a PANDA SECURITY AIDE. Her informal uniform, and all the other details in the building, carry out the Panda design motif. As they head down the main corridor --

(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Doc!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKIP>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford looks that way. In the distance, Skip is descending from an upper level on his skateboard via a unique system of ramps designed for that purpose alone. None of the hustling Panda Employees in the area take any particular notice of the sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Skip meets Mumford and his escort at the bottom of the ramp with a spectacular stop.
</DIRECTION>
<SKIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, Jennifer, I'll take him from here.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why me? How did you know you could trust me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKIP>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're completely reliable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
Skip is pleased. They approach a heavy steel door, the entrance to Skip's Workshop. A VERY OLD SECURITY AIDE sits at the end of the intersecting hallway, watching this area. Skip shouts down there --
</DIRECTION>
<SKIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's just me, Dino!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKIP>
<DIRECTION>
The old man nods, barely awake.
</DIRECTION>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Skip, I've got a problem and I need some advice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<SKIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want my advice? Far out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKIP>
<DIRECTION>
Skip puts his hand in a scanning device in the wall. Some lights blink and the heavy metal door pops open a few inches. Skip has to put all his weight into opening the door. He hesitates, suddenly concerned --
</DIRECTION>
<SKIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope nothing you're about to see will shake your faith in me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKIP>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford reassures him with a look. Skip pushes the door open far enough for them to enter, then pulls it closed behind them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. SKIP'S WORKSHOP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford and Skip enter the large, windowless workspace. What at first appears chaotic is, in fact, carefully organized. Many different disciplines interface here:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BODY SECTION: The first thing one notices -- some incredibly life-like, anatomically correct, sculpture/mannequins -- both male and female. You half expect them to breathe. From there, a full wall of forms descends from store mannequins and skeletons all the way down to a huge variety of inflatable sex dolls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CYBER SECTION: A dizzying array of computers and screens, some showing wire-form outlines of body parts in repeated motion. Above them, on a huge corkboard, hundreds of computer generated renderings of skin, eyes, limbs, sexual organs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BODY PARTS SECTION: Medical models of teeth, eyes, lips, limbs. Hundreds of porn store samples: plastic dildos, rubber vaginas, sucking machines and sundry genitalia.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FORM-CASTING SHOP: All the machinery you need to make rubber and acrylic forms of anything that can be computer designed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All these weird objects are set upon shiny, spotless, high- tech work surfaces. Skip watches Mumford move about in awe, picking up the odd item.
</DIRECTION>
<SKIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pretty creepy, huh? Are you totally disgusted?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKIP>
<MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
("no")
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Skip, you're a visionary. That can be a burden.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<SKIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This doesn't seem a little... perverse?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKIP>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are a lot of lonely people in the world. Somebody's gonna figure this out someday.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<SKIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not going to be me. I'm giving it up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKIP>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<SKIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all your fault. In the last 48 hours, I've completely lost interest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKIP>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What'd I do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
Skip looks at Mumford, a wide grin on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<SKIP>

<SKIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, she doesn't know about it yet. Right now, of the two of us, I'm the only one in love. But I'm very stoked.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKIP>
<DIRECTION>
Skip settles in front of the Body Parts section, framed by an array of limbs and sex toys. There's an assembled pelvic section with upper legs lying in the clutter behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<SKIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doc, how I can be of help to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKIP>
<DIRECTION>
Skip leans back against the table and accidentally hits a button. The pelvic section begins to hump, slowly and sensually, in place. It's amazingly life-like, but it makes a mechanical WHIRRING SOUND. Skip fumbles to turn it off.
</DIRECTION>
<SKIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKIP>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
Skip gets the pelvis switched off and turns back to Mumford.
</DIRECTION>
<SKIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm here for you, Doc.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKIP>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Skip, you know that it's improper -- completely unethical -- for a licensed psychologist to carry on a romantic relationship with one of his patients?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<SKIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess that makes sense.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKIP>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, yes it does...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford sinks into silence. He begins to wander the room.
</DIRECTION>
<SKIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've fallen in love with one of your patients?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKIP>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford nods. Skip is desperate to say something useful. Suddenly, he has an alarming thought.
</DIRECTION>
<SKIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doc!... It's not me, is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKIP>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford understands and can't stop a laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Skip, it's not you. But I like you a lot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
Skip is relieved. He has another thought and brightens.
</DIRECTION>
<SKIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doc, what about this? You're not really a licensed psychologist!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKIP>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford turns to meet Skip's gaze. Skip realizes the ramifications of what he's just said.
</DIRECTION>
<SKIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hmm. I guess that doesn't help... I see where you're going here. It's a mess.

Lionel's derisive snort is so obnoxious, it's hard to bear.

	Oh, for god's sake, Phyllis -- we have no reason to doubt the man! Are we listening to Lionel now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELBANCO>
<DIRECTION>
Sheeler jumps, so shocked is she by his outburst, and so humiliated for Lionel to witness it. Fighting tears and trying to maintain her dignity, she gathers up her things and walks to the door. Delbanco, immediately contrite, stands up.
</DIRECTION>
<DELBANCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Phyllis, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to shout...

<SHEELER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Dr. Delbanco, it is I who am sorry. Sorry to have wasted your time with such...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEELER>

She breaks into tears and rushes out of the office. Delbanco is left facing Lionel, who gives him exactly the look the doctor least wants to see.

Mumford is eating his lunch at the counter. He watches Lily busily working the midday rush. She sees him grinning at her, but doesn't say anything for a while. Finally, blushing --

Mumford comes in, reluctantly.
</DIRECTION>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Mr. Cook. I was wondering if Sofie was around?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<COOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Were you supposed to have a session?

Mumford follows Mr. Cook into the room. Mrs. Cook and Sofie's thirtyish brother, BEN, are in there, watching television. Mrs. Cook keeps knitting; Ben stands to shake Mumford's hand, muting the TV with a remote.
</DIRECTION>
<COOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look who's here. Have you met Sofie's moth--

<MRS_COOK>

Mumford continues to stand.

	Well, actually, I can't really... Do you think I could see Sofie?

<DIRECTION>
Mumford's surprised. Mr. Cook speaks with some pleasure.
</DIRECTION>
<COOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Her friend from the city came and took her out to dinner. First time in a long time she's been willing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOK>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A friend?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We owe that to you. She's perked up a lot since you started treating her.

</BEN>

Mrs. Cook gives Ben a condescending look and keeps knitting.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_COOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What'd you want?

</MRS_COOK>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's something I think we need to talk about.

</MRS_COOK>
<MR_COOK>

Ben gives Mumford an exasperated look, but doesn't argue.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_COOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is there something we need to know, Dr. Mumford?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_COOK>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford is conflicted, not sure what to share with them.
</DIRECTION>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... yes, I guess I should tell you. I don't think I'm going to be able to treat Sofie anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Cook and Ben exchange an alarmed glance. Mrs. Cook actually cheers up.
</DIRECTION>

	I'd better go.

</MUMFORD>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why can't you see Sofie? I know the treatment's working.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford looks from Ben to Mr. Cook, who nods his agreement.
</DIRECTION>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... you see, the problem is --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<MRS_COOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- the problem is you're a big fake. You haven't got a clue what's wrong with that girl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_COOK>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford looks at Mrs. Cook and can't stifle a laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow. You're something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<MRS_COOK>

<MR_COOK>
<DIRECTION>
(ignoring her now)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is the problem, Doctor?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_COOK>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford can't take his eyes off Mrs. Cook, even as he speaks to Mr. Cook.
</DIRECTION>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Problem? I guess there is no problem... Uh, this friend of Sofie's, where'd he take her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's she -- Roxy. Used to work with her. I think they went over to The Lantern.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Roxy! Excellent. Roxy.

Mrs. Cook looks at him sharply. She's heard what the other two have not.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. SIDE STREET/ALLEY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford carries a large Fed-Ex box down a side street and into an alley. As he passes a secluded space created by two adjacent buildings, something catches his eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MUMFORD'S MOVING POV: A young couple is embracing and talking intimately. As they separate, we can see that it is Nessa and Martin Brockett. Martin sees Mumford, but makes no sign. Nessa twists to see what Martin's looking at just as the view is interrupted by a wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford walks on, mulling what he's seen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. BACK DOOR, FOLLETT'S PHARMACY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a locked security screen at the alley entrance to the back room of the pharmacy, but the door inside is open. When a YOUNG PHARMACIST appears in there, Mumford raps on the metal screen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. HENRY FOLLETT'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Follett's private space is above and at the back of his drugstore. When you sit at his desk and in front of it, as Follett and Mumford are doing now, you can see down into the store through a floor-to-ceiling, one-way mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Fed-Ex box sits on the desk between the two men, unopened.
</DIRECTION>
<FOLLETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLLETT>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a thought I had.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<FOLLETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Should I open it now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLLETT>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford seems hesitant, but nods. Follett takes out an Exacto knife and makes the first incision, but as he's about to go on, Mumford suddenly reaches out and stops him.
</DIRECTION>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me just say something here... I have no idea if this is going to help.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<FOLLETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What exactly is it supposed to do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLLETT>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You remember when I asked you about pornography --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<FOLLETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- I find it degrading. Maximum gynecology and minimum turn-on --
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLLETT>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- and you told me that. Still, there's some kind of imagery that's haunting you and, I think, getting in your way --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<FOLLETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Which I don't necessarily agree.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLLETT>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you did come to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
Follett reacts. It's true, even if he keeps forgetting.
</DIRECTION>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My guess is these images were burned into your brain when you were young. Maybe if we could nail down the exact fantasies that are haunting you -- maybe you could get past them... Anyway, I thought we could try an experiment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<FOLLETT>
<DIRECTION>
(indicating the box)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the experiment is in here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLLETT>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford nods, but suddenly looks depressed, distracted.
</DIRECTION>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what? I think this was a dumb idea...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to take hold of the box.
</DIRECTION>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I just heard myself talking and I realize I'm completely unqualified to be doing this. Let's forget the whole thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
Follett grabs the box back.
</DIRECTION>
<FOLLETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa, whoa, what are you doing? I want to know what's in here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLLETT>
<MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
(pulling on the box)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's absolutely no reason to think this is going to have any impact on you. I'm embarrassed to have --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
Follett stands up and grabs the box, taking sole possession. Loud --
</DIRECTION>
<FOLLETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! I agree with you that you don't know what you're talking about. That's what I've been saying all along. And I can guarantee you that looking at the Lost Ark or whatever you got in here is not going to mean diddly to me...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(quieting down)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...but if you think I'm going to let you walk out of here without seeing what's in this box, you don't know much about Henry A. Follett.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLLETT>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford gives up. Follett gestures to ask whether it's safe to put the box on the desk; Mumford reassures him. Now, with much more anticipation and ceremony than before, Follett carefully cuts open the package.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CONTENTS OF THE BOX is revealed as Follett opens the flaps. There is an inner, brown paper wrapping upon which has been set a low-rent catalogue: "METROPOLITAN COLLECTIBLES -- Periodicals, Erotica, Adult Nostalgia." Follett lifts away the wrapping --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There are perhaps a dozen men's magazines of the late fifties and early sixties: Nugget, Adam, The Adam Reader, Swank, Dude. Plus several cartoon collections: Sex to Sexty, Stag Humor. Plus trashy adult novels of the era, with provocative illustrations on the covers: Night Call Nurse, The Neighbors Have No Curtains, Secretarial Sluts, etc. Finally, two video tapes, both of Russ Meyer films: MUDHONEY and COMMON-LAW CABIN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We stay CLOSE ON the contents of the box as Follett's hands shuffle through it, rapidly flipping through the pages. Very soft-core by today's standards, the common thread is clear: voluptuous, heavy-breathing sirens in tight clothes (and out of them) tempting muscular, he-man drifters or libidinous businessmen. A world of lusty secretaries, siren babysitters, and frustrated, neglected wives. In other words, exactly the erotic ambience of Follett's fantasies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SLOW TILT UP TO FOLLETT'S FACE. He is transported, mesmerized, galvanized. In fact, at this moment, as the MUSIC SWELLS, a tear is rolling down his cheek. He dare not take his eyes from this Holy Grail to look up at Mumford. The only thing that could wreck his mood now, is --
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_PHARMACIST>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Follett --
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_PHARMACIST>
<DIRECTION>
Follett jumps, startled from his revery. As the Young Pharmacist steps tentatively into the office, Follett jams everything back into the box as best he can and tries to cover it.
</DIRECTION>
<FOLLETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?! What the hell is so important I can't have five minutes --?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLLETT>
<DIRECTION>
The Young Pharmacist is cowed and doesn't advance into the room.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_PHARMACIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's her, sir. You told me to get you when she came to pick up her prescription.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_PHARMACIST>
<DIRECTION>
It takes Follett a moment to understand, but when he does, his whole manner changes. He dismisses the Young Pharmacist with a nod, then gives a quick, self-conscious glance to Mumford.
</DIRECTION>
<FOLLETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, sorry, I'm going to have to...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(indicates box)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I really appreciate what you're trying to... uh, I can't thank you enough for...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLLETT>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My pleasure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
Follett heads for the door, pausing briefly at a mirror to check his appearance, pushing at his hair with his palm.
</DIRECTION>
<FOLLETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll see you on... whatever...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLLETT>
<DIRECTION>
He hurries out. Mumford stands up to leave, but first looks down through the one-way mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHAT HE SEES: Follett hurries up behind the prescription counter, where Althea Brockett is waiting; once again she looks quite sexy. Follett brings her prescription up and begins playfully flirting. Althea is responsive. Follett motions Althea down the aisle, where it's more private. He comes out from behind the counter, ostensibly to show Althea something on the prescription bottle. Althea leans back against some shelves in the same posture as the Landlady in Follett's first fantasy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford reacts, bemused.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. HIKING TRAIL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford and Sofie make their way slowly up the trail. Despite her labored breathing, it's clear Sofie has made enormous progress since we first saw her.
</DIRECTION>
<SOFIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When I was in high school we used to come up here and make out. I liked to sit on the rock and watch the sun go down.

	That's what I like.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>

</SOFIE>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's one way to put it.

</MUMFORD>
<SOFIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I bet I know what changed your mind...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Mumford looks at her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...My mother. She was so horrible, you decided you couldn't desert me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIE>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought only action movies had villains like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>

Sofie gestures ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<SOFIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the cut-off, isn't it?

<DIRECTION>
(Mumford nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know why you were going to quit seeing me.

Mumford slows at this. Sofie heads off the trail into the woods.

:SC: EXT. BIG ROCK LOOKOUT POINT - DAY

Sofie appears first, but she waits for Mumford before she steps tentatively onto the rock. Mumford takes firm hold of her and leads her to a spot where she can securely settle herself.
</DIRECTION>
<SOFIE>

	You feel like a fake, an imposter...
	</DIALOGUE>

Mumford looks up, sharply.

</SOFIE>
<DIRECTION>
She puts a hand on his arm.

He winces at her formality.

<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<SOFIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't tell you how much I admire you. You have a wonderful way with people. And you're very insightful. I feel like you've seen me clearly... I never used to admit what a horrible person my mother was. You've made that possible for me.

	That's... good?
	</DIALOGUE>

	Not one who's treating me, of course.

(yes)

She takes a look at her watch and immediately lights her cigarette as she stands up --
</DIRECTION>
<NESSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oops... gotta go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NESSA>
<DIRECTION>
She heads toward the waiting room. Mumford gestures to indicate the back door. She waves him off. He shakes his head -- no one wants to use the back anymore.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nessa opens the door to the waiting room. Martin Brockett is sitting there. He makes a gesture to Nessa to underline the fact that he is not reading any of the many magazines lying around, then stands up. She goes into his arms like maybe she's the puppy. He beams and looks at Mumford.
</DIRECTION>

<GILROY>

(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doctor Mumford?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GILROY>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford is startled to find a man in a suit, GILROY, rising from the chair behind the door. He's got a briefcase and a document in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't see you there. Can I help you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<GILROY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My name's Gilroy. I'm from the State Certification Board.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GILROY>
<DIRECTION>
He proffers the document in his hand, but Mumford doesn't take it.
</DIRECTION>
<GILROY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all right, it won't bite you. Under civil code 1294.67b you are entitled to be notified that your status and certification are being reviewed. This is the notice.

</MUMFORD>

Gilroy stops, outside door already open.
</DIRECTION>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What brought this on?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<GILROY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not at liberty to say. Sometimes it's just routine, sometimes there's been a complaint. We'll be in touch.

</GILROY>
<DIRECTION>
He goes out. Mumford considers the paper in his hands, thoughts elsewhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. MUMFORD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON A PACKING CARTON half full of books. PULLING BACK and FLOATING OVER other boxes, half-packed with Mumford's personal belongings -- he doesn't have a lot. On the bed, an open suitcase with a few clothes thrown in. We're STILL MOVING across the room and out onto the porch, to REVEAL Mumford in his chair, nursing a beer, looking up at the starry sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford HEARS THE SHOWER GO ON downstairs at Lily's. Then the MURMUR AND GIGGLE of a wet couple.
</DIRECTION>
<SKIP>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Far out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKIP>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford smiles. He gets up and goes inside, closing the door behind him so as not to violate their privacy. He goes to the suitcase, takes out some clothes and begins putting them back in the dresser. Right now, he's not going anywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXTREME CLOSE-UP of Ernest Delbanco. We can't tell where he is at first. As he speaks, we PULL BACK to REVEAL him lying on Mumford's couch -- a patient.
</DIRECTION>
<DELBANCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and when you said at lunch about everybody having "a secret life", something just snapped inside me. I knew I could no longer continue my relationship with Dr. Sheeler. It was tearing me up inside. And I know Phyllis wasn't getting what she needed from it. What had started as a genuine respect, I think, for each other's professional abilities, and became, over time, a personal attraction had somehow... migrated into a rather torrid sexual relationship...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELBANCO>
<DIRECTION>
Across the room, Mumford sits, chin in hand, displaying no reaction.
</DIRECTION>
<DELBANCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I won't go into that today. Though, if we should continue these sessions, as I certainly hope we will, there are some aspects of that I would like to look at. God knows, I've listened to enough people giving me the juicy --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(catches himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...At any rate, I just wanted to acknowledge the catalyzing effect your comment had on me. I just hope that it doesn't come roiling back upon you like some dreadful undertow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELBANCO>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
This next is painful for Delbanco.
</DIRECTION>
<DELBANCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... you see, when I broke it off with Phyllis, she was naturally upset and she became more determined than ever to pursue certain -- how to put it -- doubts she's been harboring...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELBANCO>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What kind of doubts?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<DELBANCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	About you... your background and your qualifications. I'm afraid Phyllis somehow got you mixed up in her fury with me, and actually took the whole issue to the state board.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELBANCO>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford digests this.
</DIRECTION>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<DELBANCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And please, for whatever small way I may have encouraged this, accept my apologies.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(brightens)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is good news, though.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELBANCO>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<DELBANCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Phyllis has decided to leave town and pursue her practice in the city. Which leaves you the only psychologist in town.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELBANCO>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Sheeler is leaving Mumford? I'm sorry to hear that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<DELBANCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As you can imagine, my own feelings about this are mixed... Unlike, I must say, those of my wife.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELBANCO>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford's head snaps up. He had no idea Delbanco was married.

:SC: EXT. GAS STATION, SMALL TOWN (IN HENRY FOLLETT'S FANTASY) - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We (CAMERA) are being pummelled by three SMALL TOWN TOUGHS behind Old Man Sutter's gas station/diner in the Follett's fantasy town. [In BLACK & WHITE.] Beyond them, Old Man Sutter's stacked YOUNG WIFE watches in horror from the backdoor of the building. We DO NOT SEE The Newcomer yet.
</DIRECTION>
<FOLLETT>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Old Man Sutter's young bride had got me in hot water all right, and now I was bein' dealt the beating of my life. If there'd just been two of those bastards it would have been a little closer...

One of the Toughs winds up and delivers the coup de grace. CUT TO BLACK, then FADE UP ON:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. ATTIC ROOM, BOARDING HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STILL IN SUBJECTIVE CAMERA as the concerned Landlady, cleavage foremost, stands away from us, having patted the unseen Newcomer's face with a washcloth. Beyond her, near the half- open door, stands her Cheerleader Daughter, worriedly chewing on her thumb.
</DIRECTION>
<FOLLETT>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Landlady was good at quite a few things, but doctoring wasn't one of them...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLLETT>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO REVERSE and see the hero, who this time is actually played by Henry Follett, appearing in his own fantasy for the first time. He's lying in bed, his face bruised in the manner of a fifties movie.
</DIRECTION>
<FOLLETT>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Lucky for me, one of the other boarders, the broad who lived downstairs in the front room...
	</DIALOGUE>

BACK AT THE DOOR, the Cheerleader hears someone coming and steps aside to make way for -- Althea Brockett, dressed now in a nurse's uniform so tight the buttons are straining.
</DIRECTION>
<FOLLETT>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...was a nurse...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLLETT>
<DIRECTION>
As the Landlady and the Cheerleader retreat out the door, Althea the Nurse sways forward toward the bed bearing bandages and a bowl of steaming water, a lascivious look of concern on her face.
</DIRECTION>
<FOLLETT>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and she had ways to make you feel better they didn't teach in nursing school.

Althea the Nurse places a bandage over Follett's eyes, BLACKING OUT THE SCENE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - (PRESENT) DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford sits beaming at Henry Follett on the couch. Mumford's glance takes in the clock and he stands up, signalling the end of the session. Follett snaps out of his revery and gets up.
</DIRECTION>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm very happy for you, Henry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford, surprisingly, takes Follett's hand and shakes it vigorously.
</DIRECTION>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I feel like we're making real progress here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<FOLLETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me too, Doc. And I can't tell you what that package meant to me --
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLLETT>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford stops him with a "don't mention it" gesture. Follett accepts and goes out the back door. Mumford is pleased someone still wants to use that door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford returns to his desk and begins reading some papers when he HEARS the entry door to the waiting room. Not expecting anyone, he checks the clock, then goes to his office door and opens it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sofie is standing there, very agitated, just about to knock. She peers past him to see if he's alone.
</DIRECTION>
<SOFIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need to talk to you... Doctor. Can I come in?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIE>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
Sofie sits on the couch. Mumford sits in his chair, facing her. Her voice is as strained as her manner.
</DIRECTION>
<SOFIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We haven't met in this office since that first time. This is how a real professional and his client are supposed to see each other.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIE>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford waits.
</DIRECTION>
<SOFIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It might've been more appropriate if we had followed a traditional approach to the doctor-patient relationship.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIE>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is something wrong, Sofie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<SOFIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, something's very wrong, Dr. Mumford.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIE>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're upset.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<SOFIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How intuitive! That must take years of training right there. Maybe you can guess what has upset me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIE>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford considers a long moment, several scenarios racing through his mind. Finally, carefully --
</DIRECTION>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it something you've heard about me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<SOFIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it is not something I've heard about you! It is someth--
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(stops suddenly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why? Is there something I should have heard about you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIE>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you tell me what's on your mind?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
Sofie suddenly finds it difficult to look into his eyes, she looks around frenetically for a moment. Then, indicating the couch --
</DIRECTION>
<SOFIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	May I?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIE>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford gestures "of course." Sofie swings her legs up and lies on the couch so they can no longer see each other's face. (It's the most vigorous movement she's yet shown us.) This seems to help Sofie a bit.
</DIRECTION>
<SOFIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right... I'm going to come right out and say this, because that's what your shrink is for, right, so you can tell him what's bothering you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIE>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Um-huh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<SOFIE>
<DIRECTION>
(tone still rough)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First of all, I have been feeling much better lately. I don't know if the syndrome is over -- if it's just run its course or something -- but I feel a hundred per cent better than when I first came to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIE>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm glad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<SOFIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Given that, I'm obviously not going to be judging things in the most realistic way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIE>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't follow you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<SOFIE>
<DIRECTION>
(sharply)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm saying that since I'm doing so much better -- which I attribute to you -- I'm liable to misinterpret some of my feelings.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIE>
<MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
(tentative)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<SOFIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The point is this -- I am not a blank page. I did not just fall off the turnip truck. Do you know what I mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIE>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<SOFIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know a little about psychology. I took three different courses in college. It's true, none of them were above the two hundred level, but I took them... And there was one concept I remember very well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIE>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<SOFIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Transference!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIE>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Transference.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<SOFIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, and that is what I have got right now. I have taken my feelings of gratitude... and relief... and transferred them onto... you. I have taken all those warm, grateful emotions and confused them with feelings for you... So that now I am under the delusion...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a deep breath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...that I am in love with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIE>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford appears frozen in his chair. There is a heavy silence in the room. Sofie does not look back there.
</DIRECTION>
<SOFIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIE>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<SOFIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you can understand why I have some serious questions about your methods. I mean, obviously it becomes much more likely that I'm going to have confusion about this when your idea of treatment is to go walking in the woods and up to make- outs-ville and do all these highly romantic activities --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIE>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, Sofie's voice cracks. She is starting to cry, but refuses to acknowledge it.
</DIRECTION>
<SOFIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- We had a paper route together, for godssake! Do you understand how I might be a little resentful? Knowing that this so-called "love" I'm feeling is totally bogus, and just a pathetic case of... transference?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIE>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford doesn't know what to say. He's on the rack. Finally --
</DIRECTION>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. Then Sofie gets up, wiping at tears with the back of her bare hand. Mumford jumps up to offer her a tissue, but she ignores it. She will not meet his gaze.
</DIRECTION>
<SOFIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe you ought to think about how you're going to fix this. And when you do...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(suddenly losing her will)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...please get back to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIE>
<DIRECTION>
Sofie turns to go out through the waiting room, but after a step, she stops, pirouettes and goes out the back.

	What it might take is... doing time.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Too bad. That's tough, I mean it. I'm not unsympathetic. But Skip says you're in love.

Mumford straightens, looks at Lily and acknowledges it.
</DIRECTION>
<LILY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then it's worth it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LILY>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford looks at Lily a long moment, then leans over the fence and kisses her on the forehead. Ainge jumps back over to her side.
</DIRECTION>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll tell her tonight.

Mumford turns and continues toward his stairs.

:SC: INT. MUMFORD'S APARTMENT - MAGIC

Mumford comes in, drops his coat, gets a carton of orange juice out of the fridge and drinks directly from it. Distracted, he picks up the remote from the kitchen counter and switches on the TV, then opens his freezer and stares inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNSOLVED MYSTERIES comes on. The opening segment previews a story about a couple who claim to have had a visitation from Gianni Versace, then one about a yacht that went down near Venezuela. ROBERT STACK, in his characteristic fragmented delivery, intones the preview for the last story, accompanied by appropriate footage:
</DIRECTION>

In the kitchen, Mumford spins to look. DISSOLVE TO:

LATER IN THE PROGRAM. Documentary shots of IRS Headquarters, etc., are INTERCUT with hokey-looking re-enactments from Mumford's life -- with a YOUNG ACTOR who looks vaguely like Mumford playing him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN MUMFORD'S APARTMENT the telephone is RINGING. Clearly, it's not the first time. Mumford, watching the show intently, lifts the headset an inch from the cradle and then hangs up. When it immediately RINGS AGAIN, Mumford takes it off the hook, cuts off the call, and buries the headset under a sofa cushion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE SHOW: scenes of tax investigation -- in the show's version the IRS guys have drawn guns and are storming houses -- are interspersed with scenes of sordid drug-taking.

	Who was this enigma... a courageous public servant or a debauched addict?... Either way, his last known stop was here... isolated in the Arizona desert... taken in by an order of devoted monks...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT_STACK>
<DIRECTION>
IN AN ARIZONA TOWN, a monk with a clerical collar, BROTHER TIMOTHY, is loading groceries into the back of a pick-up. He's being ambush interviewed. He's polite, but not cooperative.
</DIRECTION>
<BROTHER_TIMOTHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We don't talk about the people who've been our guests... but I can tell you this about our order -- we believe everybody has the right to start over... everybody deserves a second chance.

</BROTHER_TIMOTHY>
<DIRECTION>
Shots of wind-swept desert, cactus, and dust-blown highway.

<ROBERT_STACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And perhaps... that is exactly the chance the now-sober pilgrim took... on a blustery November day... walking away from the rehab center... never to be heard from again...

MUMFORD'S SISTER AGAIN:
</DIRECTION>
<MUMFORD_S_SISTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like to know if he's alive. If he is, I just hope he's happy and his new life is...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(not sure how to put it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...well, I hope he's found what he was looking for...

<DIRECTION>
Mumford, in his apartment, watches with real emotion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His sister's face DISSOLVES into a new snapshot of Mumford, dressed in an Orkin Exterminator uniform, as the MUSIC on the show comes up. A 1-800 telephone number appears across the bottom of the frame.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT_STACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you have any information about this man or know anything about his whereabouts, contact the Sheriff's Department in Cochise County, Arizona, or call this number...

:SC: EXT. SECOND FLOOR PORCH, THE DUPLEX HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford comes out to the rail and looks off over the town of Mumford.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHAT HE SEES (or imagines he sees): all across the nightscape, one window in every house is glowing blue with flickering TV light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. COOK HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVING IN on the porch steps. Mumford runs into the shot. In fact, he's run the whole way from his place and he's out of breath. He takes the porch steps three at a time, rings the doorbell, and waits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Cook peeks out, then opens the front door, an especially sour look on her face. She speaks through the screen door.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_COOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, look who's here...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_COOK>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good evening, Mrs. Cook.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<MRS_COOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just who is here, can you tell me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_COOK>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could I see Sofie, please?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<MRS_COOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you can not. I wouldn't know who to say is calling.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_COOK>
<SOFIE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mother...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIE>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Cook glances inside at the as-yet-unseen Sofie, then hisses at Mumford --
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_COOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could see right through you from the start, you imposter. I know what you're after. I knew it then and I know it now!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_COOK>
<DIRECTION>
Sofie appears behind her mother.
</DIRECTION>
<SOFIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mother...

</SOFIE>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you think I'm after, Mrs. Cook?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<MRS_COOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sofie. It's so obvious... you're after my daughter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_COOK>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I gotta say, Mrs. Cook, you're right about that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
Both Sofie and Mrs. Cook are set back for a moment. Mrs. Cook recovers fastest --
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_COOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It'll never happen! You're in big trouble, mister.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_COOK>
<SOFIE>
<DIRECTION>
(scary strong)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mother... go away!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIE>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Cook suddenly appears, takes Mrs. Cook by the arm and makes her vanish. Sofie and Mumford are left alone. She looks at him through the screen.
</DIRECTION>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess you saw the show...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<SOFIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which show was that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIE>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sofie...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<SOFIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Part of it. We were watching "ER" until someone called.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIE>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You probably got the idea.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
Sofie comes outside. She doesn't get too close or look at him as she walks to the other end of the porch.
</DIRECTION>
<SOFIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know what a betrayal this is?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIE>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford knows.
</DIRECTION>
<SOFIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...How violated I feel?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIE>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not the only one...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
Sofie turns sharply to look at him, ready to blow up.
</DIRECTION>
<SOFIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You feel violated?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIE>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not me... all my other my patients. I smelled tar and feathers on the way over here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<SOFIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You deserve it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIE>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford agrees. He watches her closely.
</DIRECTION>
<SOFIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I should be irate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIE>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford immediately perks up. Sofie tries to correct --
</DIRECTION>
<SOFIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am irate!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIE>
<MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
(grabbing at the thread)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<SOFIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But nothing... I'm mad as hell. This is a terrible thing you've done.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIE>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know it! Please believe me, I know that...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford steps closer to her.
</DIRECTION>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But, there is one... mitigating factor I want you to consider before you write me off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<SOFIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIE>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you think about it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<SOFIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. Depends. I'm in a bad mood.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIE>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you. More than I've ever loved anyone or anything in my life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
She looks into his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<SOFIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIE>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to spend the rest of my life with you... but I'm not sure you feel the same way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
She regards him for several moments, her mind racing.
</DIRECTION>
<SOFIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I sort of do...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIE>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford feels joy. Now, finally, he takes her in his arms.
</DIRECTION>
<SOFIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...but first, you have to tell me something...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIE>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anything... just ask.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<SOFIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is your name?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIE>
<DIRECTION>
As Mumford breaks into a huge grin, CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. COURTROOM, MUMFORD COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Mumford is at the defense table. Lionel is his lawyer. Sofie, Mr. Cook and Ben sit right behind the rail.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDGE_OTTO>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The defendant will rise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE_OTTO>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford and Lionel stand up.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDGE_OTTO>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sit down, Lionel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE_OTTO>
<DIRECTION>
Lionel sits down, squelched again. We see JUDGE OTTO for the first time, a tough guy in his sixties.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDGE_OTTO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Clarence Norman White, do you understand how serious are the crimes with which you have been charged?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE_OTTO>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<JUDGE_OTTO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you realize how insidious it is to invade the most private thoughts and secret lives of unsuspecting people?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE_OTTO>
<DIRECTION>
WE SEE there's a pretty big turnout for this hearing. Prominent among the onlookers: Lily and Skip, sitting together; Nessa and Martin, holding hands; Dr. Delbanco and MRS. DELBANCO. Gilroy, from the State Certification Board, sits with the PROSECUTOR.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDGE_OTTO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...People who have come to you with the faith that you know what you're doing... and that you are who you say you are?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE_OTTO>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, your honor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<JUDGE_OTTO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It means absolutely nothing to me that so many of your patients have come forward with praise for you and your therapeutic skills. You understand that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE_OTTO>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.

</MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
Follett is sitting in one of the back rows, apparently alone. But now he looks down the row. Althea is sitting down at the end in a stylish suit, completely appropriate, but a size too small.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She gives Follett a sidelong glance, then crosses her legs provocatively. Whatever fantasy they're currently enacting is working really well for both of them.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDGE_OTTO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. White, I am frustrated that the criminal code in this state allows a maximum sentence of only six months and a maximum fine of only $2000.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE_OTTO>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, your honor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<JUDGE_OTTO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE_OTTO>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry you're frustrated.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<JUDGE_OTTO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you disrespecting this court, Mr. White?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE_OTTO>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, sir. I was empathizing. Sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<JUDGE_OTTO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe you can empathize with this -- Maximum fine. Three months in jail, three months house arrest. Sentence to begin immediately at the Orchard Valley Correctional Facility. Case closed. This court is adjourned.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE_OTTO>
<DIRECTION>
The judge slams down his gavel, stands up and stalks out. A DEPUTY moves in to take custody of Mumford. Lionel stands up and leans in --
</DIRECTION>
<LIONEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a country club. Don't worry about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIONEL>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks for your help, Lionel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUMFORD>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford turns to face the Cooks. Mr. Cook and Ben shake his hand like he's just won something. Lionel addresses them all with his usual self-satisfaction --
</DIRECTION>
<LIONEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll have him out in half the time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIONEL>
<DIRECTION>
WE PUSH IN on Mumford and Sofie, who embrace.
</DIRECTION>
<SOFIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got off easy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIE>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you wait for me?

</MUMFORD>
<SOFIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're only talking about six weeks.

</SOFIE>
<MUMFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you be here?

</MUMFORD>
<SOFIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course... I haven't got the energy to get out of town that fast.

:SC: INT. STATE CORRECTIONAL SEDAN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mumford is alone in the backseat, handcuffed to a metal restraint. A lone COUNTY CORRECTIONAL OFFICER is up front, driving. There's a heavy security screen divider between front and back.
</DIRECTION>
<CORRECTIONAL_OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Better make yourself comfortable. We got a three hour drive here.

</CORRECTIONAL_OFFICER>
<MUMFORD>

	Not any more.

They ride along in silence. At peace, Mumford watches the town go by. Finally --
</DIRECTION>
<CORRECTIONAL_OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll tell you, Doc, the wife and I, we got a little bit of a problem. Would you mind if I just ran it by you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORRECTIONAL_OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
The Correctional Officer watches Mumford in the rear view mirror, waiting hopefully. Mumford ponders the question a long time, then gives a "what the hell" shrug.

	Go ahead.
