EXT. MIDTOWN MANHATTAN STREETS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind the opening credits, we watch a montage of RUPERT PUPKIN making his daily rounds as a messenger delivering manila envelopes and packages to various New York offices, always courteous and polite in his demeanor, PUPKIN is an attractive-looking young man just past thirty and dressed in a stylish blue suit, broad tie and wide-collared shirt. His shoes are neatly polished, his hair carefully groomed. As the montage continues, we see that he has finished his deliveries and is walking rapidly towards his destination. It turns out to be a television theater north of Times Square whose marquee announces THE JERRY LANGFORD SHOW. It is dusk and the show is about to break. There is a very small crowd already positioned at the stage door -- a few young girls, a few curious passers-by who have stopped to see who will emerge. Three professional autograph hunters are clustered together:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MAE, a lady in her sixties, wears a red velvet dress, a lace hat and much too much rouge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SIDNEY is in his mid-twenties, tall, badly-complexioned, slicked hair but otherwise neatly dressed. He carries a brown lunch bag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CELESTE is an enormously fat woman in her mid-thirties. She wears a large cape to conceal her obesity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A middle-aged MAN, dressed in a corduroy suit, emerges from the backstage door which is guarded by a large, white-haired POLICEMAN. The non-professionals in the crowd just peer at the MAN but MAE immediately steps in front of him with her autograph book raised.
</DIRECTION>
<MAE>
<DIRECTION>
(to the MAN)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you somebody?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAE>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, honey, I'm just a working stiff.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<DIRECTION>
The MAN keep walking and MAE returns to her cohorts just as PUPKIN arrives.
</DIRECTION>
<MAE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Rupert.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAE>
<CELESTE>
<DIRECTION>
(coolly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Rupert.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CELESTE>
<SIDNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who did you get?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIDNEY>
<PUPKIN>
<DIRECTION>
(distractedly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nobody.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<DIRECTION>
PUPKIN carefully places himself near the door, a step or two away from the other professionals.
</DIRECTION>
<MAE>
<DIRECTION>
(to SIDNEY)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got Mr. Raf Vallone outside 21.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAE>
<CELESTE>
<DIRECTION>
(to SIDNEY about PUPKIN)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He'd never tell you anyway, Sidney.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CELESTE>
<MAE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then I got him again at the Pierre at four o'clock.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAE>
<SIDNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be a dear, Mae. I don't happen to have Mr. Vallone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIDNEY>
<MAE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what I want for him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAE>
<SIDNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I have only six Barbra's left. You know how difficult she is to work with.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIDNEY>
<MAE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't have her even once.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAE>
<CELESTE>
<DIRECTION>
(to MAE)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe Rupert would help you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CELESTE>
<DIRECTION>
PUPKIN shoots a hostile glance back at CELESTE.
</DIRECTION>
<SIDNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you do that, Rupert? You don't feel about Barbra the way I do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIDNEY>
<MAE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll give you Mr. Burt Reynolds too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAE>
<CELESTE>
<DIRECTION>
(needling RUPERT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Sidney, Rupert doesn't do that sort of thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CELESTE>
<SIDNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about it, Rupert? I'll give you whoever you want.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIDNEY>
<DIRECTION>
SIDNEY starts pulling little white cards out of his paper bag and reading them off.
</DIRECTION>
<SIDNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rodney Dangerfield ... Richard Harris ... Liza Minelli ... and she's not so easy to work with either ... Louise Lasser!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIDNEY>
<CELESTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're wasting your time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CELESTE>
<DIRECTION>
PUPKIN has been trying to remain apart from the other three. Finally he turns to SIDNEY.
</DIRECTION>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Sidney. I'm just not interested. This isn't my whole life, you know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<CELESTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that supposed to mean -- that it's my whole life, or Sidney's or Mae's?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CELESTE>
<MAE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is so my whole life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAE>
<CELESTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up, Mae. What about your mother? Isn't she part of your life?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CELESTE>
<MAE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's her whole life too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAE>

The show breaks. The doors swing open and people pour out. The crowd around the backstage door swells.
</DIRECTION>
<POLICEMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(to the crowd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you want Jerry's autograph, give me your piece of paper and I'll send it backstage.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POLICEMAN>
<DIRECTION>
A number of people in the crowd hand in pieces of paper. PUPKIN is standing next to a young couple, about college age. The YOUNG GIRL has just sent in her paper.
</DIRECTION>
<PUPKIN>
<DIRECTION>
(to the GIRL)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you going to do with Jerry's autograph?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<YOUNG_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. Maybe I'll sell it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_GIRL>
<BOYFRIEND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll tell you what she's going to do with it. She's going to pin it on her bulletin board and have an orgasm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOYFRIEND>
<DIRECTION>
The YOUNG GIRL laughs unself-consciously.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
LANGFORD's limousine waits directly in front of the stage door. MAE has engaged the CHAUFFEUR who stands at the door of the car in conversation.
</DIRECTION>
<CHAUFFEUR>
<DIRECTION>
(wearily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Mae.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHAUFFEUR>
<MAE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't mean now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAE>
<CHAUFFEUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Mae.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHAUFFEUR>
<MAE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll get right out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAE>
<DIRECTION>
The CHAUFFEUR, smiling, shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A plain-looking GIRL in a black raincoat and black, floppy hat stands on the street side of the limousine, carefully watching MAE and the CHAUFFEUR talk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<MAE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I've never been in one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAE>
<DIRECTION>
We hear a cry as a celebrity emerges from the backstage door. MAE turns and goes back towards the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The POLICEMAN is handing out the autographs. Suddenly LANGFORD emerges, flanked by three PAGES, husky young men in their early twenties dressed in theater uniforms. There is screaming and some yelling of LANGFORD's name. LANGFORD pays no attention. Smiling nervously, he makes his way towards the limousine. The CHAUFFEUR stands at the rear of the car, holding the door. LANGFORD enters the car and then suddenly springs back. The GIRL in the black raincoat and black hat has hidden herself in the back seat of the limousine. The three PAGES, who have already turned and headed back toward the theater, hear the commotion and swing around. The GIRL, who we shall come to know as MARSHA, hides herself in the far end of the limo, so two of the PAGES go around to the far side of the car and start pulling her out while the third PAGE moves into the limo from the street side. She fights
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
like a wildcat, but the PAGES slowly manage to drag her out. During the struggle, LANGFORD stands amid the crowd, a bit shaken. PUPKIN stands next to him, staring at him. When finally catches LANGFORD's eye, PUPKIN smiles pleasantly.
</DIRECTION>
<PUPKIN>
<DIRECTION>
(to LANGFORD who barely listens)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How the hell did that girl get in there? Jesus, they certainly don't give you very good protection, do they?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<DIRECTION>
LANGFORD says nothing, glancing nervously at PUPKIN.
</DIRECTION>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at you here. Who the hell is watching you? Any one of these freaks could just walk right up to you and do whatever he wants.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<DIRECTION>
A couple YOUNG GIRLS are pressing against LANGFORD.
</DIRECTION>
<FIRST_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Jerry. How can we get to talk to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FIRST_GIRL>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a minute. This is crazy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<DIRECTION>
PUPKIN straightens up for action.
</DIRECTION>
<PUPKIN>
<DIRECTION>
(yelling at the crowd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay! Stand back!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<DIRECTION>
PUPKIN wades through the crowd towards the limousine, pushing SIDNEY and MAE among others out of the way. LANGFORD follows in the path PUPKIN is clearing.
</DIRECTION>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't you hear me?!? Come on, people, have a heart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<DIRECTION>
The PAGES have succeeded in pulling the GIRL out of the far door of the limo just as PUPKIN and LANGFORD arrive at the near door. The CHAUFFEUR has been blocked by the crowd from opening the door so PUPKIN opens it.
</DIRECTION>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stand back!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(To LANGFORD)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go ahead, Jerry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<DIRECTION>
LANGFORD slips in quickly. He looks up at PUPKIN who is holding the door, smiling pleasantly.
</DIRECTION>
<LANGFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks. Thanks very much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANGFORD>
<DIRECTION>
PUPKIN stares at LANGFORD for a moment and then slides into the limo next to him, closing the door behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIMO - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hate to bother you like this, Jerry, but could I speak to you for a minute.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<LANGFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like to but ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANGFORD>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know you're a busy man. I promise not to take very long, really. But I need your advice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<DIRECTION>
PUPKIN looks down at his hand which has been badly scratched.
</DIRECTION>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't have a handkerchief, do you? Jesus, these people will kill you for a cufflink.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<DIRECTION>
LANGFORD hands him a monogrammed handkerchief, then checks his watch.
</DIRECTION>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks. If you have to be somewhere, I don't mind talking as we drive. You can drop me off anywhere.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<LANGFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, but I've got a strict rule never to ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANGFORD>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I put myself on the line for you, Jerry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<DIRECTION>
Reluctantly, LANGFORD signals with his head to his CHAUFFEUR to start moving. As the car moves through New York traffic, PUPKIN and LANGFORD talk.
</DIRECTION>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, Jerry. I'm grateful for this chance to talk to you ... I hope I'm not boring you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<LANGFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll let you know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANGFORD>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? Fine. I'm Rupert Pupkin, Jerry. I know that the name itself doesn't mean very much to you but it means an awful lot to me, believe me. Maybe you've seen me outside your show and wondered who I am. Well, right now, I'm in communications but, by nature, I'm a stand-up comedian. I know what you're thinking -- 'oh no. Not another one.' And I wouldn't take up even one minute of your time if I wasn't absolutely convinced of my talent. I'm really good, Jerry, believe me, I'm dynamite. Now you're probably wondering if I'm so good why haven't you caught my act somewhere, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<LANGFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANGFORD>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, up to now, I've been biding my time, developing my act slowly and carefully so that when my big break finally comes, I'm ready -- like you were that night Paar got sick and you sat in for him. I was there that night, in the theater. That was the most important night of my life, until tonight, of course.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<DIRECTION>
PUPKIN fishes a cigarette case out of his jacket pocket, flips it open and offers one to LANGFORD.
</DIRECTION>
<LANGFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No thanks. I don't smoke.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANGFORD>
<DIRECTION>
PUPKIN returns the pack to his pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me neither. I just carry them as a courtesy. How about a cough drop?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<LANGFORD>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling indulgently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No thanks. I don't cough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANGFORD>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I try not to but sometimes, you know ... Am I making any sense?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<LANGFORD>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANGFORD>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, that night you did Paar, I walked out of the theater like I was in a dream. All of a sudden, I knew what I wanted. I started catching your guest appearances on Sullivan and taping them and, when you got your own show, it got to be a kind of regular thing. I studied how you built to your one-liners, nice and relaxed like you were chatting, and how you delivered the jokes without leaning too much on them, without saying "here's the punchline, folks." And I watched the way you played off dead audiences, how you let those long silences build until people couldn't stand it and then the way you got them off the hook with that slow smile. You were my college of comedy, Jerry, like a kind of teacher, a friend. I know it sounds crazy, but when you watch someone every night ... But that's all in the past. What I'm trying to say is this. I'm ready now. I've finished the course. And I'm thinking as we sit here talking "Is this it? Is this that one big break?" Is it, Jerry?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<DIRECTION>
There is a long pause.
</DIRECTION>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jerry?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<LANGFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look ... er ... what was the name?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANGFORD>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm Rupert, Jerry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<LANGFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Rupert. I know what you're saying. But things don't work that way. You can't just walk onto a network show without any experience. You've got to start at the bottom ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANGFORD>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But that's where I am!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<LANGFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've got to work your way up, learn your trade in front of live audiences, start playing the little clubs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANGFORD>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But that can take years, Jerry! Look at me. I'm already 31 years old! People my age are way ahead of me. I've got some catching up to do and I need your help. What do you say, Jerry? All I'm asking you to do is listen to my act. That's all. Is that asking too much?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<LANGFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I get calls from agents every day. All they want ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANGFORD>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I tried getting an agent. I did, Jerry. But you know how it is. You can't get an agent unless you're working and you can't get work unless you've got an agent ... or unless you know somebody. And the only person I know is you, Jerry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<DIRECTION>
There is a long pause.
</DIRECTION>
<LANGFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, why don't you call my office.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANGFORD>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could I?!? Oh, I knew you'd say that, Jerry. You don't know how many times I've had this conversation in my head. And this is the way it always turns out. That's why I had to sort of invite myself into the car tonight. I know it's kind of presumptuous and I really appreciate the time you've given me. But breaks like this don't just happen. You have to make your own breaks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<DIRECTION>
The limousine starts slowing down as it pulls up before U.N. Plaza. It stops. LANGFORD gets out. PUPKIN follows.

<DIRECTION>
LANGFORD turn to PUPKIN, looking to get rid of him as cleanly and gracefully as possible. LANGFORD extends his hand. PUPKIN goes to shake it but his hand is wrapped in the handkerchief. He extends his left hand. LANGFORD shakes it awkwardly.
</DIRECTION>
<LANGFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice meeting you, Rupert. I hope it all works out for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANGFORD>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, Jerry. I don't know how to repay you. I'm a little short on cash this evening, but, if you don't mind some good, hearty food, I'd be honored to take you to dinner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<LANGFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, but some people are waiting for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANGFORD>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I understand. Well, then, maybe I could repay you with a joke.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<DIRECTION>
LANGFORD is starting to walk into the building.
</DIRECTION>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a minute. How's this? The first night you do your show from the coast, you open this way. "Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, it's great to be back here in Southern California where you can wake up in the morning and listen to the birds coughing ... "
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<LANGFORD>
<DIRECTION>
(nodding but unsmiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not bad. Maybe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANGFORD>
<DIRECTION>
PUPKIN calls after LANGFORD who heads for the entrance to his building.
</DIRECTION>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Consider it a gift. Hey, Jerry! How about lunch? My treat!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<LANGFORD>
<DIRECTION>
(turning back before he enters the building)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Call my office.

PUPKIN waves with his bandaged hand, notices LANGFORD's handkerchief and unwraps it.

(to the handkerchief)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, Jerry.

PUPKIN and LANGFORD stand at the edge of the foyer, waiting for the Maitre d' to seat them. VINCENT, the owner, spots them and hurries over.

<VINCENT>

(To PUPKIN, angrily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did you get in?

	That's alright. Now if you'd be good enough to find us a nice table.

PUPKIN pushes a five dollar bill into VINCENT's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Certainly. This way, please.

VINCENT leads PUPKIN and LANGFORD to the "bullpen," a select spot in a corner of the restaurant.

The WAITER leaves.

<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You look tired, Jerry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<LANGFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It shows, does it? It's all these problems with the show. That and the custody suit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANGFORD>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was sorry to read about that, Jerry. Charlene never should have gotten the kids. If there's anything I can do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<LANGFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I appreciate it, Rube. Just talking about it a little with you helps.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANGFORD>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie arrives. He is a small, slightly-bald man with greying hair and a goatee. He wears a foulard under an open-necked shirt. He carries a long sketch pad. He immediately sets up a small easel and starts sketching.
</DIRECTION>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hasn't Eddie already done you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<LANGFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never mind. You were saying ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANGFORD>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I've been giving a lot of thought to your situation, Jerry, ever since I saw you starting to lose ground in the ratings. And I think I know what the problem is. Too many of the same faces.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<LANGFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANGFORD>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, people are getting tired of these people who live off game shows and talk shows and can't really do anything. They've seen 'em and heard 'em till they can't stand it anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<LANGFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, maybe you're right, Rube.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANGFORD>
<PUPKIN>

	I'm sure I am. When a show runs out of surprises, it loses its audience.

	You see what I mean? What you need on the show is some unknown quantity, some brilliant talent making his television debut. Imagine the suspense. Who is this young guy? How will he do with the eyes of all America on him? Something like that has got to help.

INT. LANGFORD'S APARTMENT

LANGFORD enters his apartment. It is tasteful, modern, spacious and empty. A floodlight shines on a single setting at the end of a long dinner table. He walks over to a large aquarium and sprinkles some food for the fish.
</DIRECTION>
<LANGFORD>

On a shelf above the aquarium stand three pictures, one of two boys, roughly eight and eleven, flanked by a shot of each boy alone. LANGFORD walks to the end of the table where a covered dish and a New York Post await him. He lifts the covered dish which reveals a large, cold salmon.

</RITA>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. As a matter of fact, that's why I'm here. I've known about this place for a long time. I just didn't want to make my move until I had something to offer you. Everything's a question of timing.

RITA stares at PUPKIN as he rattles on.

	<DIALOGUE>
	You call me up all junior and senior year. Night after night after night, right? And every time I'm wondering 'when is this guy going to stop talking and ask me out?' Well, now I know the answer. August twelfth, nineteen seventy-six. It only took you ten, eleven years to work up to it.

RITA starts laughing again.

<RITA>

	Because I thought you were a jerk!

</RITA>
<PUPKIN>

	You see! I was right! But that guy isn't me anymore. I look at my picture in the yearbook and I don't even recognize myself. I'm not the same guy, Rita.

A bull-necked MAN in his early forties enters. He waves a brief hello to RITA as he walks by. RITA smiles and the MAN takes a seat at the far end of the bar.

RITA goes to the far end of the bar and serves the MAN a beer. They chat briefly as PUPKIN watches uneasily. Finally PUPKIN downs his beer and raises his glass.
</DIRECTION>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miss! Miss!

</PUPKIN>
<DIRECTION>
The MAN gets RITA's attention for PUPKIN. RITA returns to PUPKIN and serves him another beer.
</DIRECTION>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm in the mood to celebrate tonight. Why don't we go to this nice restaurant I know, talk over and times, get to know each other all over again.

</PUPKIN>
<RITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And then?

</RITA>
<PUPKIN>

	Well, tomorrow night I thought we'd go out again, talk some more, get to know each other even better.

</RITA>
<PUPKIN>

	You'll see. Right now I'm asking you for a date. How about it?

</PUPKIN>
<RITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, Rupert. But I'm busy.

<RITA>
	<DIALOGUE>

RITA goes to the far end of the bar. She pours him another beer and settles against the bar, resuming her chat with him. PUPKIN looks for a moment and downs his beer. He raises his glass.

	Miss! Miss!

RITA returns to him.

</PUPKIN>
<RITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	None of your business.

</RITA>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you want to go out with him for?

</PUPKIN>
<RITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's a good friend of mine.

</RITA>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell him you're busy.

</PUPKIN>
<RITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's so important about tonight?

</RITA>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everything! You don't understand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<RITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I don't. It's been really nice seeing you, Rupert. Thanks for dropping in. But I've got some work to do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RITA>

RITA leaves PUPKIN and returns to the far end of the bar where she once again resumes talking with the MAN. PUPKIN sits for a moment, gets up slowly and heads for the john.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE JOHN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He enters the john and goes to the farthest of the three urinals. A moment later, the MAN enters. He goes to the nearest of the three urinals. The two men stare at the wall before them but the obvious tension between them renders them both incapable of relieving themselves. PUPKIN glances over at the MAN's face, then immediately turns back to the wall as the MAN turns to look at him. The MAN glances quickly at PUPKIN and then returns to staring at the wall. PUPKIN sneaks a furtive glance at the MAN's penis. The MAN sneaks a furtive glance at PUPKIN's penis.

INT. THE BAR - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
PUPKIN emerges from the john, followed a moment later by the MAN. They resume their seats at each end of the bar. A third MAN has come in and is seated midway between PUPKIN and the MAN.
</DIRECTION>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miss!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<DIRECTION>
RITA walks over reluctantly.
</DIRECTION>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen to me for a second.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<RITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have work to do, Rupert.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RITA>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just listen. I'm at the start of something really big. I don't want to talk about it here but it's going to happen soon and it's going to be great -- for both of us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<RITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No kidding?

<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
RITA turns to go.
</DIRECTION>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I haven't finished!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<DIRECTION>
RITA returns to the MAN and pours him another beer. PUPKIN sits for a few moments, then downs his beer quickly. Again, he raises his glass.
</DIRECTION>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miss! Miss!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<DIRECTION>
The MAN leans over the bar and tells RITA something. She opens a bottle of beer and hands it to the MAN who slides it down the bar towards PUPKIN. As the beer reaches the middle of the bar, the THIRD MAN seated midway between PUPKIN and the MAN raises his beer glass to take a sip just as the sliding beer bottle passes under his hand. The bottle stops right in front of PUPKIN who takes it and slides it back with equal force. At this moment, the THIRD MAN in the middle has finished his sip and has just placed the THIRD MAN's glass on the counter. The beer bottle collides with the THIRD MAN's glass, creating a mess. RITA glares at PUPKIN as does the THIRD MAN. PUPKIN shrugs an apology and RITA cleans up the mess.
</DIRECTION>
<RITA>
<DIRECTION>
(to the THIRD MAN)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll get you another one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RITA>
<DIRECTION>
As RITA cleans up the mess and pours a fresh beer, the MAN walks down the bar towards PUPKIN. He leans over him and puts a supposedly friendly paw on his shoulder. PUPKIN glances distastefully at the MAN's hand on him.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
<DIRECTION>
(to PUPKIN)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, friend. I'm trying to have a nice civilized conversation with the young lady. Be a good little lad, huh, and give us a break.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<DIRECTION>
PUPKIN looks up at the MAN who pats him on the back in a gesture of fraudulent friendship and menace. PUPKIN burps. With an effort, the MAN controls his temper and returns to his seat at the end of the bar. PUPKIN instantly raises his glass.
</DIRECTION>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miss! Miss!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<DIRECTION>
The MAN advances towards PUPKIN with another bottle of beer. PUPKIN watches passively as the MAN pours half the bottle into PUPKIN's breast pocket and slams the half-empty bottle on the counter. The MAN walks down to the end of the counter where a smiling RITA is waiting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PUPKIN again gulps his beer down. RITA and the MAN stare at PUPKIN expecting him to raise his glass and call for another beer. PUPKIN just sits there. After a few moments, RITA and the MAN resume their conversation, but they keep glancing over at PUPKIN, expecting him to interrupt them with a call for beer at any moment. PUPKIN continues to sit there. Just as RITA and the MAN have settled back into their conversation, PUPKIN falls like a stone from the barstool onto the floor. He lies motionless. RITA and the MAN look at PUPKIN for a moment while the handful of other patrons glance at him and return to their drinks. RITA leaves the bar and goes to the rear of the restaurant, disappearing into the kitchen. As she does, the MAN walks over to where PUPKIN is lying inert and prods him cruelly with his foot.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, schmuck, wake up so I can kick your ass outta here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<DIRECTION>
The MAN turns to the kitchen to see if RITA is returning. As he does, PUPKIN carefully opens one eye, grabs a free chair from a nearby cocktail table, rises and bangs the MAN smartly over the head. The MAN falls, out cold. PUPKIN straightens up quickly as the other patrons look on with interest. PUPKIN brushes off his suit, which is blue, just like the MAN's, and stands above the MAN just as the MAN stood above him, his back to kitchen. RITA emerges from the kitchen with the owner, MR. NICHOLS and a large black COOK.
</DIRECTION>
<RITA>
<DIRECTION>
(to NICHOLS)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was making trouble one minute and the next he was on the floor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RITA>
<DIRECTION>
RITA automatically reaches out as she talks for what she thinks is the MAN's arm. Instead, PUPKIN turns around smiling, leaving her too startled to speak. NICHOLS and the COOK lift the MAN to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<COOK>

NICHOLS and the COOK lead the MAN, who is still groggy, out of the bar as RITA continues to stare at PUPKIN with a mixture of curiosity and amusement.

INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT ON UPPER WEST SIDE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are in the kitchen watching two dishes being chopped, shredded and boiled in deep fat. The activity is frantic. WE FOLLOW the two dishes as a WAITER carries them from the kitchen to a booth where PUPKIN and RITA are talking. It is a painfully plain restaurant, shaped in a rectangle, with booths lining either side and a row of little tables in between. At the back is the kitchen and two phone booths, facing each other. An old Chinese WOMAN mans the cash register by the door. The WAITER sets the dishes down before RITA and PUPKIN and clears an enormous plate of spare rib bones from RITA's place. RITA hands the WAITER her empty cocktail glass. RITA and PUPKIN are facing one another.

	Another one, Chan.

The WAITER nods and leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<RITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So all this time you've been thinking about me, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RITA>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right, Rita.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<RITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What kinds of things were you thinking?

</RITA>
<DIRECTION>
PUPKIN drops his eyes shyly. RITA starts laughing.

	Oh, ho! Those kinds of things! Shame on you, Rupert.

PUPKIN

Rita, I assure you there was ...

<RITA>

	Rupert Pupkin is an unclean person!

	Rupert Pupkin is an unclean person. Oh, come on, Rupert. Relax. Have a little fun.

</RITA>
<DIRECTION>
WAITER arrives with RITA's drink and chopsticks and a beer for PUPKIN.
</DIRECTION>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is a very important evening to me, Rita.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<RITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you know your nose wiggled when you talked?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RITA>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It does?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<RITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Just the tip. Like a rabbit.

PUPKIN serves RITA.

<RITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It always looks like they put worms in this stuff.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RITA>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just taste.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<DIRECTION>
RITA tastes.
</DIRECTION>
<RITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I guess it won't kill me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RITA>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is supposed to be the finest Cantonese cuisine in the city.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<RITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah? Then what happened to the tablecloths?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RITA>
<DIRECTION>
PUPKIN drops his eyes.

<RITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, don't worry about it. This is fine.

<DIRECTION>
(She takes a long drink)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm having a good time. So you've been devoted to me, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RITA>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I used to see you at the Garden every year.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<RITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, the Follies. That was the right name for 'em. How did you know which one was me? We all looked like chickens. What I mean is, we all looked like the same chicken. I thought it was gonna be Rita Keane in the Ice Follies and I wind up looking like Henny Penny.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RITA>
<DIRECTION>
RITA chuckles to herself.
</DIRECTION>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You just didn't get the breaks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<RITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Breaks, bullshit! My parents didn't have the money for the right coach. But what difference does it make?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RITA>
<DIRECTION>
She starts laughing to herself.
</DIRECTION>
<RITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I remember once we were down in Atlanta and the ice machine broke down. We did three hours of slush. Everyone was falling on their faces and hopping up with their arms open for a bow like the whole thing was planned. And the people ate it up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RITA>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I liked the show.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<RITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah? The Follies? You really must have been carrying the torch. What did you think when I got married? You knew I got married?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RITA>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I knew it wouldn't last.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<RITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think I should have married you, instead, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RITA>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Peter Drysdale! Really, Rita!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<RITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If he'd only been hit by a train. He was worth a helluva lot more dead than alive, I can tell you that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RITA>
<DIRECTION>
RITA raises her glass to the WAITER who is standing nearby, talking with another WAITER. As she does, a nice-looking young MAN sitting in the middle aisle raises his glass of beer to her and drinks it, as a kind of toast. RITA smiles briefly and her eyes return to PUPKIN. The YOUNG MAN is seated behind PUPKIN, facing RITA. The WAITER comes over and collects the glass. Throughout the rest of the scene, a subtle flirtation continues between RITA and the YOUNG MAN.
</DIRECTION>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you seeing anyone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<DIRECTION>
RITA starts for a moment, thinking PUPKIN has caught her looking at the YOUNG MAN.
</DIRECTION>
<RITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RITA>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to know about the competition, that's all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<RITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, tomorrow night, I've got a date with Joe Namath -- you know Joe. And Thursday --- let's see --

	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure I see people. I'm not a nun, Rupert. I see a lot of people.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RITA>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyone special?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<RITA>
<DIRECTION>
(chuckling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean am I "going steady"? Rupert, I'm thirty-one years old!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RITA>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about that guy tonight?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<RITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RITA>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<RITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What am I supposed to do, huh? Sit home watching TV? He's just some guy. He's got his own aluminum siding business. He comes into the city sometimes, that's all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RITA>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't go out with him for his money?!?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<RITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, horrors! Look, Rupert, what do you think they pay me in that dump? Ninety-five bucks. And you don't get the world's greatest tippers in there either. Somebody has to take care of me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RITA>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what I want to talk to you about, Rita.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<DIRECTION>
The WAITER arrives with RITA's drink.
</DIRECTION>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's your favorite movie star?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<RITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are, Rupert. Especially your nose.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RITA>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just tell me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<RITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this some kind of game? Are you going to tell me something about my character?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RITA>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll see. Give me his name.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<RITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't think of anybody.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RITA>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've got to have one, Rita. Everybody does.

</PUPKIN>
<RITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Okay. Let's see.

PUPKIN slowly pulls out a leather-bound book from his inside jacket pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<RITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Rupert! Are we going to exchange
	</DIALOGUE>
</RITA>
<DIRECTION>
phone numbers!?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PUPKIN expertly flips to a middle page in the book and, keeping the book open, his finger pointing under a name, he turns the book to RITA.
</DIRECTION>
<RITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's her name.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RITA>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Her name! She signed this herself, especially for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<DIRECTION>
RITA starts flipping through the book, curious about the other names. She isn't paying any attention to what PUPKIN is saying.
</DIRECTION>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She wasn't a great actress but she had a real gift for comedy. She died tragically, you know, alone, like so many of the world's most beautiful women. I'm going to see that doesn't happen to you, Rita.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<RITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's this one?

PUPKIN checks the book.

<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Burt Reynolds.

<RITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yeah, the guy with no clothes. Who's this?

</RITA>
<PUPKIN>

<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>

	Never heard of her.

	<DIALOGUE>
	And that's Woody Allen and there's Ernie Kovacs -- he's dead -- and that one's Lauren Bacall.

<RITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't really know any of these people?

</RITA>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take a look at this.

PUPKIN flips to one of the back pages and shows a name to RITA.

<RITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is?

</RITA>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! It's ... it's Rupert Pupkin
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<DIRECTION>
PUPKIN tears out the page and hands it to her shyly. RITA just stares at it and back at PUPKIN.
</DIRECTION>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't lose it. It's going to be worth something in a couple of weeks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<DIRECTION>
RITA start laughing.
</DIRECTION>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what I've been trying to tell you. Things are really breaking for me. I'm ticketed for stardom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<DIRECTION>
RITA laughs harder, despite efforts to be serious.
</DIRECTION>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only a couple of hours ago, I was talking to Jerry Langford, the Jerry Langford. Stop it, Rita!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<DIRECTION>
RITA pulls herself together for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We were talking about my doing my act on his show.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<RITA>
<DIRECTION>
(suppressing a smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your act?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RITA>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get that guy you knew from Clifton out of your head right now. You're looking at Rupert Pupkin, Rita. Rupert Pupkin, the new King of Comedy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<DIRECTION>
RITA starts laughing hysterically, in spite of herself.
</DIRECTION>
<RITA>
<DIRECTION>
(getting a grip on herself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RITA>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not me, Rita? A guy can always get what he wants if he's willing to pay the price. All it takes is a little talent and sacrifice and the right break. If you've got a friend in the right place, that's all it takes. And that's exactly what I have going for me right now. After all, crazier things have happened.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<DIRECTION>
RITA listens silently for a moment, then begins to giggle. As PUPKIN resumes speaking, we CUT between RITA and the YOUNG MAN. Their flirtation picks up steam. The YOUNG MAN raises his eyebrows as if to ask, "Are you interested in me?" She smiles. All the while, PUPKIN rattles on.
</DIRECTION>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You just don't realize what a shot on the Langford Show can mean. That's coast to coast, national TV, a bigger audience than the greatest comedians used to play to in a lifetime. A shot like that means a free ticket on the comedy circuit -- Flip Wilson one week, Cosby the next, then Sonny and Cher or Carol Burnett. And you've always got those other talk shows to fall back on -- Carson, Griffin. And all that leads straight in one direction, Rita -- Hollywood! That's when we really start living. How does this sound to you -- a beach house in Malibu, right on the ocean. You'll get a beautiful tan, believe me. And we'd keep a suite at the Sherry. That's the only place to stay when you're big. We could get something on a top floor and look down on all our old friends in Clifton and just laugh. How does that sound to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<RITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It sounds wonderful, Rupert, and I really hope you get what you want. But it's getting late and I'm a working girl. You know what I mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RITA>
<DIRECTION>
The telephone at the back of the restaurant starts ringing. A WAITER in the background moves slowly to answer it.
</DIRECTION>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You going to spend the rest of your life in that place? Is that what you really want, talking about nothing with nothings? I thought you wanted something a little better than that and that's what I'm offering. Every King needs a Queen, Rita. I want you to be mine. What do you say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<RITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You really want to help me out? You see this.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(She points to her lower back molar)

	A hundred seventy-five bucks. If you could spare fifty, say, until next Monday, that would keep three people really happy -- me, my landlord and my dentist.

EXT. THE STREET - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
CAMERA FOLLOWS PUPKIN as he streaks out the door and jumps into the adjacent doorway, immediately peering down the street. He spies the YOUNG MAN and RITA walking about three quarters of a block down and follows them, keeping out of sight. They turn occasionally to see if he's around, then stop turning. They go around the corner and disappear into a large apartment building. PUPKIN rushes
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
after them, positioning himself across from the building. He searches the windows for some clue as to where they have gone. Finally a set of lights go on on the fourth floor and a MAN's shadow is seen closing two sets of blinds.

Next to the door, on the wall, are listed the tenants, their apartment numbers and a button next to each name. There is an intercom speaker.

	Leisure is America's fastest growing industry. Did you know that? Think about it. Short work weeks, more vacation. People need something to do with all that time and that's where I come in. Leisure Villages, Inc. We buy land an hour or so outside your metropolitan centers. We set up the bungalows, dig some lakes, lay out a golf course, you know, fix the whole place up so it's usable. Then young, personable guys like me show the people around. It the guy seems tight, we point out the investment factor. If he's a swinger, well, the bungalows are very private. If he's a sports nut, we talk up skiing and fishing and tennis.

INT. PUPKIN'S ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PUPKIN enters. WE SEE that it is a small room, furnished by the hotel in the plainest way. Nicely-done home-made collages of show business figures decorate the drab green walls. The room is neat and clean. PUPKIN goes directly to a plain table which holds two tape recorders -- one a small cassette the other a large table tape recorder. He picks up the microphone of the larger one and speaks into it.
</DIRECTION>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Testing. Testing. Testing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<DIRECTION>
In the following montage, we hear in the background the replay of his "testing, testing testing" and various other noises -- a bit of his voice taped, a burst of laughter, the squeal of a tape recorder sent fast-forward, a sudden burst of applause, a scrap of theme music. At the same time, the CAMERA PANS about the room. We look at the collages which include all the obvious show business figures, with a heavy emphasis on comedians from Chaplin and Keaton to Sid Caesar and Woody Allen. The collages also include such varied figures as Jimmy Carter, Julia Childs, Tom Seaver, David Brinkley, Muhammad Ali, Clifford Irving, Walter Cronkite and Mark Spitz. There is a special Kennedy section -- John F. and Bobby framed in black, Jackie in mourning and a picture of Teddy. There is also a trio of assassins -- Sirhan, Oswald and James Earl Ray. There is also a talk show collage with a photo of Langford in the center like a sun surrounded by Snyder, Walters, Carson and Griffin. One bookshelf holds a veritable library of comedy -- joke books, biographies of comedians, treasuries of American humor. Another shelf holds scores of tapes in their own little boxes, each one neatly marked, i.e., "LANGFORD MONOLOGUES: 7/5/72 to 9/9/72." "MISC. MONOLOGUES 6/13/68 to 8/1/69."

PUPKIN stops the tape recorder and thinks again for a few beats. He then starts the large recorder.
</DIRECTION>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, Jerry. Before I begin, I just want to thank you for listening to this material and for the opportunity that you've given me. You know, lots of people think that guys like you, you know, people who have made it, lose their feeling for struggling young talent such as myself. But now I know from experience that those people are just cynics, embittered by their own failure. I know, Jerry, that you're as human as the rest of us, if not more so.
	</DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh well, I guess there's no point going on about it. You know how I feel. So let's get on with the show. The best of Rupert Pupkin! I've sketched out this little introduction in order to save you a little time. So close your eyes and imagine it's exactly six o'clock. You're standing in the wings and we hear Rick Ross and the Orchestra strike up your theme song.

</DIRECTION>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now you come on, Jerry, and do your monologue. Then, when the time comes, this is how I see you introducing me. You'll say something like this. "Ladies and Gentlemen we're going to do something a little bit different tonight. It isn't often that you can call someone a sure thing in the entertainment business. After all, the verdict is always in your hands. But I think after you've met my next guest, that you'll agree with me that he's destined for greatness. So, now, will you please give your warmest welcome to the newest King of Comedy, Rupert Pupkin!!!"

PUPKIN pushes the cassette and we hear another enormous burst of applause. PUPKIN lets it run, listening intently. He stands up and faces a wall of his room, still holding the microphone. WE SEE that the wall is covered by a huge blow-up of an audience laughing and applauding.

WE SEE MARSHA trailing LANGFORD. LANGFORD notices her and starts walking quickly. MARSHA walks quickly. LANGFORD starts jogging. MARSHA starts jogging. Finally, LANGFORD breaks into a sprint. MARSHA runs after him. LANGFORD disappears into his office building. MARSHA arrives several seconds later.

Just as MARSHA turns around, PUPKIN, unaware of her, walks cheerfully into the building.

<RECEPTIONIST>

<RECEPTIONIST>

<RECEPTIONIST>

</RECEPTIONIST>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I wanted to see Jerry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<RECEPTIONIST>

</RECEPTIONIST>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright.

PUPKIN paces for a few beats. He smiles at the RECEPTIONIST. A beat later, CATHY LONG comes out, carrying the tape in its box.

</PUPKIN>
<CATHY_LONG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine, Mr. Pupkin. Thank you for your tape. We listened to it with great interest. And, frankly, Mr. Pupkin, we saw a lot of good things in what you're doing. We feel you have good potential. Very good potential.

</PUPKIN>
<CATHY_LONG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it's not just that, Mr. Pupkin. You see, Jerry likes to panel his guests, you know, chat with them afterwards.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHY_LONG>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. Sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<CATHY_LONG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And frankly, we just don't feel you've got very much to talk about right now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHY_LONG>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I've got my whole life to talk about!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<CATHY_LONG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which is interesting to you, I'm sure and to your wife ... and to a few friends. But we feel that you should keep developing your act. Test it in some live situations. There are a number of clubs in the city you can try. And after a reasonable period, get in touch with us again and we'll be glad to send someone down to check out your progress.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHY_LONG>
<DIRECTION>
PUPKIN stares at her for a few moments as the tension grows.
</DIRECTION>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	May I ask you a question, Miss Long?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<CATHY_LONG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course.

</CATHY_LONG>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you speaking for Jerry?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<CATHY_LONG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's put it this way, Mr. Pupkin. Mr. Langford has complete faith in our judgment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHY_LONG>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry to have to say this, Miss Long, and I certainly don't want you to take it personally, but I have to tell you that I don't ... I don't have faith in your judgment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<CATHY_LONG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'm sorry you feel that way, Mr. Pupkin. But I'm afraid there's nothing that can be done about that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHY_LONG>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No ... No ... I'm afraid I'll have to disagree with you again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<CATHY_LONG>
<DIRECTION>
(with strained politeness)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's your privilege, Mr. Pupkin. Now, if you'll excuse me, please, I have some things to do. I'm sorry the news isn't better.

CATHY LONG turns to go.

CATHY LONG turns back.
</DIRECTION>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When are you expecting Jerry in?

</PUPKIN>
<CATHY_LONG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He won't be in until very late this afternoon.

</CATHY_LONG>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's fine. Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<DIRECTION>
CATHY LONG stares at PUPKIN for a moment, glances at the RECEPTIONIST and then goes. PUPKIN takes a seat in the reception area. He smiles once more at the RECEPTIONIST. The RECEPTIONIST drops her eyes. A few beats go by. CATHY LONG passes by the entranceway and glances at PUPKIN. PUPKIN continues sitting there.
</DIRECTION>
<RECEPTIONIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is there anyone else you would like to see?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RECEPTIONIST>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's alright. I'm happy just waiting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<DIRECTION>
A few beats pass in silence.
</DIRECTION>
<RECEPTIONIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, would you mind waiting outside, please, Mr. Pupkin? This is a reception area, not a waiting room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RECEPTIONIST>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I understand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<DIRECTION>
PUPKIN remains seated. A few more moments pass. Several OFFICE PERSONNEL pass by the entranceway and glance at PUPKIN. After a few more beats, a large, plainly-dressed MAN in his mid-fifties emerges from the back offices. He goes over to PUPKIN, who stands.
</DIRECTION>
<OFFICIAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Pupkin? I'm Raymond Wirtz, in charge of security for the Langford organization.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OFFICIAL>
<DIRECTION>
WIRTZ puts his arm on PUPKIN's shoulder and, as the following dialogue unfolds leads him out the door, down the corridor and into the elevator.
</DIRECTION>
<WIRTZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now I think you understand that we have certain rules here that are essential to the smooth functioning of our operation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WIRTZ>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. Sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<WIRTZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that without these rules, we really wouldn't be able to function at our best. You follow my point?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WIRTZ>
<DIRECTION>
PUPKIN nods.
</DIRECTION>
<WIRTZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now one of these rules is that only authorized personnel and those having official business with our organization are permitted on our premises. And that's why I'm asking you, Mr. Pupkin, to cooperate with us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WIRTZ>
<DIRECTION>
They have reached the elevator and WIRTZ has pushed the button.
</DIRECTION>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want me to leave the building.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<WIRTZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right. It's nothing personal, Mr. Pupkin. Just doing my job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WIRTZ>
<DIRECTION>
The elevator arrives. WIRTZ signals with his head that PUPKIN should enter. PUPKIN gets in.

<WIRTZ>

The RECEPTIONIST starts making a call inside. PUPKIN glances at her and walks right in to the inner corridors. He starts peering into the open doors of the offices that line the corridor. The whole place is like a gigantic maze. OFFICE PERSONNEL pass by him, taking no notice of him. He continues wandering around desperately, completely lost. A few beat later, he spots WIRTZ leading a pair of SECURITY GUARDS. PUPKIN keeps peering into offices quickly as he flees. The GUARDS and WIRTZ finally catch up to PUPKIN at the steno pool and, after a brief chase around the pool, they catch PUPKIN and subdue him. They start dragging him out past the eyes of the OFFICE PERSONNEL.

It is a large white house with colonial columns set in the middle of a palatial estate whose rolling lawns are punctuated with fine old trees. We circle around to the back where LANGFORD, a handful of his FRIENDS (which can be familiar television celebrities) and PUPKIN and RITA are just finishing a lavish lunch on the patio. A pair of SERVANTS are clearing the table and serving the coffee and desert as the scene unfolds. As we arrive, we hear a loud burst of laughter. PUPKIN is regaling the COMPANY with
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stories.
</DIRECTION>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, you have no idea how bad it's gotten in New York. Now the muggers are so efficient that, each time they jump you, they take your name and address and put you on a mailing list.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(the COMPANY chuckles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And once you're on the list, you're in real trouble, like this friend of mine who was mugged thirty-two times on his way home from work.

RITA looks up, smiles and blushes. The rest of the COMPANY smiles benignly and grows attentive as RITA returns to eating her tart. Suddenly she bites down on something hard. She fishes it out of her mouth and looks at it. The COMPANY giggles. It is the ring PUPKIN purchased at Cartier's. The COMPANY applauds lightly and laughs. LANGFORD lifts his wine glass.

The theater is packed. World Series bunting hangs from the balcony and the front of the stage. We hear RICK ROSS and the ORCHESTRA strike up Mendelssohn's Wedding March. Down one aisle walks RITA, accompanied by the MAN whom PUPKIN hit over the head at the bar. Down the other aisle marches PUPKIN, accompanied by LANGFORD. The AUDIENCE cheers wildly. The two COUPLES walk to the stage where a white- haired OFFICIAL awaits them. BERT CANTER stands at his side. PUPKIN and RITA disengage from their ESCORTS and stand before the OFFICIAL. The music stops and the AUDIENCE grows quiet.
</DIRECTION>
<OFFICIAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We are met here in these extraordinary circumstances to join this man and this woman in holy wedlock. But, before we begin, let me voice a personal word of thanks to you, Rupert and to you, Rita, for choosing me to perform this prestigious ceremony. Because we are on prime time, I am going to discard my customary remarks in favor of a few personal reflections. When I was principal at Clifton High and these two were students, I had very little faith that Rupert here would amount to very much. But like his teachers and his fellow students, I underestimated this fine young man. Some say that this misjudgment is directly tied to my recent dismissal as head of the Clifton School System. But let me take this opportunity to set the record straight. Knowing that Rupert and Rita here were most certainly destined for a great career and a lifetime of happiness, I voluntarily stepped down. I would only here add my own wishes to those of millions of viewers for their continued health, wealth and boundless success.

It is a handsomely furnished room, done in old American antiques and other tasteful pieces. There is a grand piano heavy with pictures in one corner and wall-to-wall bookshelves that are mostly full and mixed with a balance of classics and modern popular reading. The whole room marks LANGFORD as a man of discernment. The shelves also house a fine stereo and a small, discreet bar. RITA and PUPKIN walk in like strangers in paradise, awed by the obvious elegance and expense the room reflects.

	Look, Jerry, if I've said anything out of line, let's chalk it up to inexperience, okay? I'll just go upstairs and get my tape and we can start working. It shouldn't take long and then you'll have the rest of the afternoon to yourself.

A picture of LANGFORD sits on the bureau. There is a big brass bed with an ornate brass frame at the foot. LANGFORD stares at MARSHA and PUPKIN. PUPKIN closes the blinds and turns on the lights.

<DIRECTION>
LANGFORD is seated on a chair whose back is pressed right up against the high, ornate brass bedstead at the foot of the bed. MARSHA trains the gun on LANGFORD now. PUPKIN is unpacking a suitcase. He takes out a handsome blue suit, ruffled shirt, a bow tie, black shoes, underwear, socks, shaving equipment, soap, a hairbrush, a clothesbrush, a small shoe shine kit, aftershave lotion, deodorant and a dozen or so rolls of inch-and-a-half wide adhesive tape. He removes this stuff from a suitcase that is barely big enough to hold it -- so the mere packing of all this para- phernalia into such a small space represents something of an achievement. As he takes the stuff out, he talks to LANGFORD, his back turned to him.
</DIRECTION>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This wasn't an easy decision for me, Jerry, believe me. For one thing, I knew it meant we could never be friends again and that hurt me. It's hard to lose a friend, even one who has let you down. You always hope you can patch things up. You know, a guy like me doesn't make friends that easily.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<DIRECTION>
PUPKIN pauses a moment, then turns to LANGFORD, his voice filled with emotion.
</DIRECTION>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why didn't you just listen to the tape when I asked you? Then I wouldn't have to be doing all this. Was it really too much to expect -- a few minutes of your time to listen to something I'd worked on my whole life?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<DIRECTION>
LANGFORD's eyes shift rapidly. He is obviously calculating how to deal with PUPKIN.
</DIRECTION>
<LANGFORD>
<DIRECTION>
(with disarming charm)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, if that's what's bothering you, let's go over to my office and listen to that tape right now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANGFORD>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you crazy, Jerry? Do you know what would happen to me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<DIRECTION>
MARSHA listens to this exchange a bit nervously. Gesturing to her gun, she says:
</DIRECTION>
<MARSHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Am I going to have to hold this thing all day?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARSHA>
<DIRECTION>
PUPKIN sees she has lowered it practically to her side.
</DIRECTION>
<PUPKIN>
<DIRECTION>
(to MARSHA)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just keep it on him.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to LANGFORD)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, Jerry. Friendship is a two- way street. All that time I was worrying about you and your ratings and everything, you couldn't have cared less about me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<DIRECTION>
LANGFORD thinks rapidly for a beat or two.
</DIRECTION>
<LANGFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're right. You know that? I was thoughtless. It's just that when you're doing a big show, it's hard to tell who your friends really are. I was wrong. I apologize. Why don't we just shake hands and forget the whole thing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANGFORD>
<PUPKIN>
<DIRECTION>
(suspiciously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's easy to say, Jerry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<LANGFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I mean it. I'll tell them that the whole thing was a joke and then we can go to my office and listen to that tape. Come on. What do you say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANGFORD>
<DIRECTION>
LANGFORD rises with his hand extended toward PUPKIN.
</DIRECTION>
<MARSHA>
<DIRECTION>
(to LANGFORD, sharply)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sit down!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARSHA>
<DIRECTION>
LANGFORD looks to PUPKIN.
</DIRECTION>
<MARSHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said sit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARSHA>
<DIRECTION>
LANGFORD reluctantly sits down.
</DIRECTION>
<PUPKIN>
<DIRECTION>
(to MARSHA)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the matter? You heard what he said.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<MARSHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All of a sudden, with a gun on him, he wants to make up and be friends. And, once he's out the door, what happens then?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARSHA>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happens then, Jerry?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<MARSHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You get to his office and they jump you, that's what happens, Rupert.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARSHA>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's right, Jerry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<LANGFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not if I tell them not to. This is Jerry, Rupert, I give you my word.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANGFORD>
<PUPKIN>
<DIRECTION>
(to MARSHA)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He gives me his word.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<MARSHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah? And what else? Come on, Rupert, I'm sick of waiting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARSHA>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what else, Jerry?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<LANGFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Rupert. My word's good enough, isn't it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANGFORD>
<DIRECTION>
PUPKIN stares at LANGFORD for a few beats. Then he shakes his head sadly and says in a very quiet, discouraged voice.
</DIRECTION>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Jerry. It's not.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to MARSHA)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep the gun up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<DIRECTION>
PUPKIN comes over to LANGFORD with a few rolls of adhesive tape in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry to do it this way, Jerry, but I'm no good at knots. Just put your arms up and out, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<DIRECTION>
LANGFORD spreads his arms back against the brass bedstead. As PUPKIN goes to tape them, LANGFORD tries to grab him, but, with sudden, demonic force, PUPKIN pins him against the bedstead. They are practically nose to nose.
</DIRECTION>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, no, Jerry. None of that. Now hold still.

	Radical?

	They're willing to sacrifice their leader in order to get their message across, aren't they? You've got to figure that this is a desperate outfit. I don't know who they are anymore than you do. But I do know I've got to stop them. Otherwise, what you're seeing here is just the first of a whole wave of these kinds of kidnappings.

</CROCKETT>
<PATTEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm only saying, Mr. Thomas, that we can't allow this to reach the public. When the kidnappers call in, of course you're going to be cooperative. Promise them anything they want. After all, this King character is going to have to show up sooner or later. And once we get our hands on him, he'll tell us where Mr. Langford is.

He reads them with a mixture of professionalism and wry distance, wanting to disown the words without seeming silly.

<RANDALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you. Thank you very much. I have some sad news for you. Earlier today, my writing staff was executed in Central Park by the network firing squad so there'll be no sensational Randall monologue this evening.

	Instead, we're going to do something a little bit different this evening -- a lot different if you ask me. We're going to give you a glimpse into the future. It isn't often that you can call someone a sure thing in the entertainment business. After all, the verdict is always in your hands. But I think tonight, after you've met my first guest, you'll agree with me that he's destined for greatness -- in one way or another. So will you please give your warmest greeting to the newest King of Comedy, Rupert Pupkin!!!!

Finally after what seems like an eternity, PUPKIN emerges, straightening his jacket a bit and trying to crane the kinks out of his neck. He is a bit tense but very high and in full command.

<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good evening, ladies and gentleman. Let me introduce myself. My name is Rupert Pupkin. I was born in Clifton, New Jersey, which was not, at that time, a federal offense.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(laughter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is there anyone here from Clifton?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(silence)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. We can all relax. Now, I'd like to begin by saying that my parents were too poor to afford me a childhood but the fact is nobody is allowed to be really poor in Clifton. Once you fall below eleven thousand you're exiled to Passaic. My parents did, in fact, put down the first two payments on my childhood. Then they tried to return me to the hospital as defective. But, like everyone else I grew up in large part thanks to my mother. If she was only here today I'd say, "Hey, mom. What are you doing here? You've been dead for nine years?"
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(laughter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should have seen my mother. She was wonderful -- blonde, beautiful, intelligent, alcoholic.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(laughter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We used to drink milk together after school. Mine was homogenized. Hers was loaded.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(laughter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Once she was picked up for speeding. They clocked her doing fifty -- in our garage.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(laughter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When they tested her they found that her alcohol was two per cent blood. They took away her license and she died shortly afterwards. We used to joke together Mom and me, until the tears would stream down her face and she'd throw up.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(laughter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And who would clean it up? Not Dad. He was too busy down at O'Grady's throwing up on his own. In fact, until I was sixteen, I thought throwing up was a sign of maturity. While the other kids were off in the woods sneaking cigarettes, I was hiding behind the house with my fingers down my throat.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(laughter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never got anywhere until one day, my father caught me. Just as he was giving me a final kick in the stomach, for luck, I managed to heave all over his new shoes. "That's it," I thought. "I've made it. I'm finally a man!"
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(laughter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As it turned out, that was the only time my father ever paid any real attention to me. He was usually too busy out in the park playing ball with my sister, Rose. And, today thanks to those many hours of practice, my sister Rose has grown into a fine man.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(laughter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me, I wasn't especially interested in athletics. The only exercise I ever got was when the other kids picked on me. They used to beat me up once a week, usually Tuesday. After a while, the school worked it into the curriculum. And, if you knocked me out, you got extra credit.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(laughter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Except there was this one kid who was afraid of me. I kept telling him, "Hit me! Hit me! What's the matter with you? Don't you want graduate?" As for me, I was the only kid in the history of the school to graduate in traction. The school nurse tucked my diploma into my sling. But my only real interest, right from the beginning, was show business. Even as a young man, I began at the very top, collecting autographs.

There is a pause as PATTEN stifles himself.

</PATTEN>
<DIRECTION>
One of the PLAINCLOTHESMEN in the back opens the door and PUPKIN and the other PLAINCLOTHESMAN get out. The unmarked car has pulled up behind the limo and other PLAINCLOTHESMEN stand next to it. PUPKIN and the two PLAINCLOTHESMEN start walking the ten yards or so to the bar-restaurant.

INT. THE BAR-RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PUPKIN marches in flanked by the PLAINCLOTHESMEN. The clock over the bar reads 11:30. RITA looks up from talking with a CUSTOMER and sees PUPKIN. She says nothing. She just looks at him. There are five CUSTOMERS at the bar. A working class COUPLE in their late fifties are half-stewed, the man telling the woman that her friend, Maud, isn't really her friend because she wants $150 for a used refrigerator. A few seats down, two MEN in their mid- forties, in wind-breakers are locked in an intense but inaudible conversation. And, close to the television set which hangs over the far end of the bar sits a MOUSY MAN with glasses, who looks like an accountant. He is sipping a beer, his eyes fixed on the set where the CBS late movie is just showing its logo. PUPKIN marches up to the bar.

	<DIALOGUE>

RITA keeps staring at PUPKIN.
</DIRECTION>
<PUPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just turn it. Come on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<MOUSY_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was here first, mister. You can't just walk in like this. It isn't fair.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOUSY_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
RITA glances at the MAN. PUPKIN can't wait. He vaults onto the bar and turns the set to the Langford Show, just as, on screen, he walks from the wings onto the stage to the applause of the studio audience. Perched atop the bar, standing next to the image of himself, PUPKIN looks down at RITA, a smile of pride and triumph on his face.

MONTAGE -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PUPKIN walking onto television screens in various homes across America -- in a chic New York living room, in a suburban bedroom, in the parlor of an Indiana farmhouse, in a kitchen where a COUPLE is in the middle of a raging domestic quarrel, in an otherwise dark bedroom where a COUPLE is in the throes of lovemaking, in a bar, a station house, in a television store window display.

INT. MARSHA'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARSHA has just removed her dress and stands in her bra and panties as LANGFORD unwraps the last tape from about his ankles. The room is swimming in tape, like an enormous boa constrictor gone mad. MARSHA moves towards LANGFORD, her arms open.
</DIRECTION>
<MARSHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, baby. Baby.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARSHA>
<DIRECTION>
LANGFORD frees his ankles of tape just in time to side-step MARSHA and moves quickly to the dining room table where he grabs the gun. He trains it on her.
</DIRECTION>
<LANGFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANGFORD>
<DIRECTION>
MARSHA moves toward him. He pulls the trigger, releasing a plastic pellet that hits MARSHA in the stomach, stinging her.
</DIRECTION>
<MARSHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ow!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARSHA>
<DIRECTION>
LANGFORD glances down in horror at the gun which he now realizes is a toy and looks up in horror to see MARSHA, bigger than life, bearing down on him.

	Don't be afraid of Marsha, baby.

INT. BAR-RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CUSTOMERS are watching the conclusion of Pupkin's monologue, along with the PLAINCLOTHESMEN and PUPKIN. WE COME IN a split second after a joke. The CUSTOMERS laugh, with the exception of the MOUSY MAN who is waiting, in bad humor, for Pupkin's act to finish. The PLAINCLOTHESMEN laugh reluctantly. PUPKIN, no longer standing on the bar, but back down with the others, watches with fascination. RITA watches grimly, occasionally glancing at PUPKIN.
</DIRECTION>
<PUPKIN>
<DIRECTION>
(on TV)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I figured it this way: better to be King for a Night than Schmuck for a Lifetime.

<DIRECTION>
(audience and CUSTOMERS laugh)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good night, ladies and gentlemen, and God bless you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUPKIN>
<DIRECTION>
The television audience applauds and the CUSTOMERS applaud and cheer in good humor except for the MOUSY MAN. The HALF-STEWED MAN leans across his WOMAN to yell at PUPKIN as the two FRIENDS in windbreakers congratulate PUPKIN at the same time. There is a brief moment of carnival excitement.

PUPKIN takes all this praise and excitement with a shy smile of satisfaction, glancing at RITA from time to time for her reaction. She merely stares at PUPKIN with a sad expression on her face.

	Come on, Rita. Don't spoil the party.

	<DIALOGUE>
	What about the hundred and fifty? We never saw a penny outta your brother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HALF_STEWED_MAN>
<HALF_STEWED_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's because my brother is a family man, not like Phil.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HALF_STEWED_WOMAN>

The argument between the HALF-STEWED MAN and his WOMAN continues at the end of the bar. The two FRIENDS have resumed their intense conversation.

The MOUSY MAN has climbed up on the bar and has turned the TV back to the late movie. He sits enthralled by a scene
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
of violence courtesy of Tony Curtis as the Boston Strangler. PUPKIN looks down the bar at the STEWED COUPLE to offer them drinks, but they are lost in an argument over the relative merits of their brothers. PUPKIN turns to the PLAINCLOTHESMEN.

The PLAINCLOTHESMEN lead PUPKIN out of the bar. The two FRIENDS are still buried in their intense, private conversation. The PLAINCLOTHESMEN and PUPKIN walk past the HALF-STEWED COUPLE.

The AUDIENCE applauds mightily and the FINAL CREDITS roll. As they roll, the music to the Langford Show continues and WE WATCH a MONTAGE that shows PUPKIN progressively taping LANGFORD to the back of a brass bedstead on stage as the two of them talk and laugh. By the end of the MONTAGE, LANGFORD is once again mummified and PUPKIN, having finished, bows and smiles. WE CLOSE on a FREEZE-FRAME CLOSE UP of PUPKIN in ecstasy.
