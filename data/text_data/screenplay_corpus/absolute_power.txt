INT. WASHINGTON MUSEUM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The saddest eyes you ever saw.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are looking at an El Greco drawing. It is a study for one of his paintings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULL BACK TO REVEAL --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bunch of art students are doing sketches of the eyes, the elongated fingers, the slender hands El Greco drew so brilliantly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Most of the students are around 20. A couple of suburban housewives are there too.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And one older man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is LUTHER WHITNEY. Mid 60s, very fit, neatly dressed. At quick glance, he seems as if he might be a successful company executive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As we watch him draw we can tell he is capable of great concentration. And patient. With eyes that miss nothing: He has pilot's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We'll find out more about him as time goes on, but this is all you really have to know: Luther Whitney is the hero of this piece. As we watch him draw --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther's sketchbook. He is finishing his work on the eyes, and he's caught the sadness: It's good stuff.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther. It's not good enough for him. He looks at his work a moment, shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>

</GIRL_STUDENT>
<DIRECTION>
She's indicated his sketchbook. He nods. She starts thumbing through.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sketchbook as the pages turn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Detail work. Eyes and hands. The eyes are good. The hands are better. Very skillful.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The GIRL hands it back. Impressed.
</DIRECTION>

	You work with your hands, don't you?

CLOSEUP - LUTHER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An enigmatic smile. Now, from that --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RED'S BAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A nice working class part of town. Nothing fancy here but there's a pleasant feel. The streets are clean, the houses neat and well tended.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther, carrying his sketchbook, walks along. It's afternoon now. Up ahead is a local bar: RED'S.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RED'S BAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther walks in. Nothing fancy here. Strictly working class. And relatively empty. An overweight bald man Luther's age works behind the bar. This is RED. They are good enough friends not to ask each other questions.
</DIRECTION>
<LUTHER>
<DIRECTION>
(as they nod to each other)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Redhead.

<LUTHER>

	</DIALOGUE>
</LUTHER>
<DIRECTION>
As he turns --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - LUTHER'S HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A street of small row houses. Clean, well tended. Luther walks toward one. Later in the afternoon. He carries half a dozen small shopping bags, from the market, the hardware store, the drug store, the cleaners.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LUTHER'S HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A terra cotta planter to the right of the front door. Luther shifts his packages, tilts the planter slightly, bends down, pulls out a key, inserts it in the front door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LUTHER'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as he enters. Neat, tidy. A Cuisinart, a cheese slicer, lots of other nice equipment. As he begins putting food away --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LUTHER'S HOUSE - DINING AREA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Evening now. Table set for one. A single candle. Beside the candle is Luther's sketch pad. Now Luther himself moves INTO VIEW, carrying a tray. He puts it down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A gorgeous omelet is on a fine china plate, parsley sprinkled neatly on top. An elegant green salad is on another plate, covered with thinly sliced parmesan cheese. An expensive water pitcher, a lovely glass. Clearly, a great deal of thought has gone into dinner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther lights the single candle. We are now aware of a photograph nearby. The picture is old. A pretty little girl stands in the center, smiling. Her mother stands alongside, smiling too. A man is with them, looking at them happily. It's Luther. When he was young.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther studies the photo a moment. Then he turns, looks out the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV SHOT - SLIVER OF MOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is visible. Lovely. Peaceful.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LUTHER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now Luther opens the sketch pad, quickly flips past the hands and eyes and faces --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- we are looking at something totally different: a mansion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HOLD ON Luther's drawing of the mansion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KEEP HOLDING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULL BACK to reveal --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the moonlight -- it looks exactly like his drawing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But no drawing could convey the size of the place -- we are looking at ten thousand square feet. Wealth and power.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We're in rolling hill country. The mansion is dark. Totally deserted. Silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now a sound - TIRES ON GRAVEL. A car comes rolling INTO VIEW. The motor of the car has been turned off. The lights of the car have been turned off. The car slides to a stop. Again, silence...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HOLD ON mansion, a couple of hundred yards away. There is a small field between the car and the estate. Now --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION/INT. LUTHER'S CAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A man holds binoculars, studying the place. He wears dark clothes, tennis shoes. He puts down the binoculars, begins to smear his face with black camouflage cream --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- it's Luther, and he's been a professional thief his entire life. He's a three-time loser, but his last sentence was so long ago and his skills are now so vast, so refined, that it is unlikely he will ever get caught again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - GROUNDS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The grounds as Luther glides through it. He wears a backpack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The night is cool.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stops. All that separates him from the mansion now is a stretch of gorgeous lawn. Except for Luther, it isn't gorgeous -- it's no-man's land.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One final check of his surroundings -- then he sets off, in graceful motion, long strides eating up the ground. He makes no sound at all.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thick wood with reinforced steel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther stops by the door, takes off his backpack, opens it. He puts on plastic gloves that have a special layer of padding at the fingertips and palms. Now he takes a key, inserts it in the front door, turns it, and the instant he pushes the door open -- ZOOM TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN MANSION - FOYER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The infrared SECURITY DETECTOR -- it immediately starts to BEEP and you can see the seconds being counted down: forty, thirty-nine, thirty --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LUTHER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- in his hands now is an automatic screwdriver, no more than six inches long --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- he sets to work on the security panel that is inside in the foyer next to the front door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The screwdriver undoes the first screw, the second --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SECURITY DETECTOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thirty-one, thirty, twenty --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCREWDRIVER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now the third and fourth screws are in hands and he lifts the security panel away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The BEEPING sound is constant --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and getting louder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A tiny device, no bigger than a pocket calculator. It has two wires protruding from it. It is, we are about to find out, a tiny computer. Luther holds it like a baby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SECURITY DETECTOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eighteen, seventeen --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LUTHER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
probing with the wires into the heart of the security panel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The BEEPING is LOUDER still.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The security panel. Luther is attempting delicate work and it's dark so it isn't easy but he continues to probe with the wires and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SECURITY DETECTOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eleven, ten --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LUTHER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
and he's got it attached!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COMPUTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now the face of the tiny computer is alive with numbers -- they fly by much too fast for us to make them out clearly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SECURITY DETECTOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Four, three, two --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FACE OF TINY COMPUTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as five numbers lock -- 7 -- 13 -- 19 -- 8 -- 11 --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The BEEPING sound dies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LUTHER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A glance across the foyer -- the lights of the security detector go from red to a warm looking green.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Safe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He allows himself to exhale. Then he's busy again, unhooking the computer. His fingers, as always, work quickly, precisely.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN MANSION - FOYER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The foyer as Luther, once again carrying his backpack, moves across it. Behind him, the front door is again shut, the security panel back on, screws all in place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's as if he hadn't been there at all...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN MANSION - STAIRCASE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther walks quickly up -- and here we get a sense of the vast size of the place -- it feels bigger inside than it looked in the moonlight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Van Gogh at the head of the stairs. Luther moves past it, then stops, goes back, studies the painting. It's a late one, when the madness had him and things were sliding away. Very sad.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther looks at it admiringly for another moment --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- then surprisingly he raises his hand, and for just an instant traces the lines of the painting in the air, as if trying to figure out how the magic was done, as if getting ready for his next museum session --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- then almost grudgingly, he moves on, up toward the third floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN MANSION - THIRD-FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Here's a Hopper. One of the great ones, filled with an overpowering sense of being alone --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Luther stares at it almost in awe, whispers "wow," moves on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN MANSION - HALLWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther, walking down the third-floor corridor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The corridor walls. No paintings here -- instead we see a series of framed photographs. The first is of a baby girl, the next one of the same child at three.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We watch the child grow up in these photos. At ten she is already pretty. At fifteen a stunner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Not a classic beauty by any means, she is turning into, if you will a latter-day Ann-Margret. The kind of girl you ached for in high school. The perfect cheerleader.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
These are pictures, we will come to know, of Christy Sullivan. A high school graduation shot at eighteen, a shot in front of a Burger King at twenty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP - WEDDING PHOTOGRAPH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Christy, looking just fabulous, is 24 and smiling happily. We can only see her face and the wedding veil here. Now --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULL BACK to reveal --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A glorious and expensive white wedding dress. Christy holds a bouquet of flowers. Breathtaking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KEEP PULLING BACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And now we can see the groom. Walter Sullivan. Walter is smiling too, one arm proudly around his lovely bride.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walter, it might be noted, is eighty years old.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther, staring at the photo, shakes his head. Now he moves on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN MANSION - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther opens the DOOR. It SQUEAKS. He goes inside, closes the door firmly. Next, he puts his backpack down, takes out a low-power non-glare work light, sets it up. Now he looks around. A huge room, a gigantic canopied bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A nightstand alongside, which contains a small silver clock, three Danielle Steel novels piled neatly one atop the other, several more photos of the happy couple --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and an antique silver-plated letter opener with a thick leather handle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther. He studies himself in front of a very large full-length mirror across from the canopied bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now we realize something -- he isn't studying himself, he's studying the mirror itself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns, goes to the sitting area where there are chairs and a sofa and a large TV and VCR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Three remotes on a side table. Luther carefully picks up the middle one, crosses the room with it, points it at the large mirror, clicks once --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and the mirror swings silently open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A room is revealed. All we can see of it so far is this: There is an armchair in the middle facing where the mirror had been.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther turns back toward the sitting area, the remote held in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The side table. Luther puts the remote down -- very carefully. In the exact position it had been. Now he takes a moment, blows on his hands, rubs them together.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then -- Luther takes a collapsible duffel bag out of his backpack, moves with the work light into the revealed room --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - VAULT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a vault! And it's FULL! There's cash, naturally, piles of the stuff. Plus all kinds of other valuables we'll get around to.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther's a little stunned -- it's more than he hoped for.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He glances at the armchair -- there is a remote on it that is identical to the one he replaced at the side table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now he opens his duffel all the way and sets to work. First the cash goes in -- all neatly bundled. Large denominations. Lots of bundles. Next are a series of slender boxes --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The first box as Luther opens it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jewelry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Into the duffel it goes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther, emptying more jewelry boxes into the duffel. And still more. As he continues to do this --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All is quiet. High on a wall, the security light beams a friendly green.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now, from somewhere, a distant sound. LAUGHTER? Was it laughter? Doesn't matter, it's gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther has moved deeper into it -- he's finished with the jewelry. Now he's examining piles of bonds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Into the duffel they go.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a breath, glances around. Perfect.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coins. Antique ones. They disappear into the duffel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stamp books. Gone into the swelling duffel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther as he hears now the DISTANT LAUGHTER. Not so perfect.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He moves quickly out of the vault, takes a step toward the door -- the GIGGLING is getting LOUDER, closer. Two people. A man and a woman.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther stops, mutters "shit!" -- glances around -- No place to hide. Luther, grabbing his backpack, moves into the vault, turns off his work light, and shuts the door with the remote. The DOOR CLICKS --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Luther is alone in the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A burst of LAUGHTER now. Growing nearer still.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther moves into the back of the vault, crouches down, doing his best to hide behind the armchair. Trapped, Luther waits in silence, trying not to breathe...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now he can hear a SQUEAK -- the BEDROOM DOOR has opened.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HOLD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dark -- except for a slant of light from the hall outside the open bedroom door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two people are briefly visible as they enter, a MAN and a WOMAN. The CLINK of GLASS. Stifled LAUGHTER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Woman closes the bedroom door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Darkness again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And now the LAUGHING sound increases. GIGGLING, really.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther in the pitch-black vault. The GIGGLING is MUTED but it is there. He is starting to perspire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The woman flicks on the lights and as she does --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther as the burst of light hits him like a fist -- and it's over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther blinks, confused, looks around --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- because it isn't over, he hasn't been caught.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door to the vault is suddenly gone. Luther is staring straight into the goddamn bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Because the door is a two way mirror. Now it's as if he was watching the bedroom on a giant TV screen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just a few feet away, just outside the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Where things are clearly starting to heat up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther moves to the armchair, sits. There is nothing to do now but wait. He settles in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are staring at each other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We have seen the woman already -- she's CHRISTY SULLIVAN. But the pictures in the corridor did not do her justice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is a fabulous-looking twenty-five-year-old woman. Long, golden hair, a round face that sets off her deep blue eyes, a tanned, curving body. A bare-shouldered black dress. An expensive necklace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One more thing: she is staggering drunk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man is ALAN RICHMOND, wealthy, successful, handsome and fit. Mid-forties. He wears an elegantly-cut suit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two additional points: (1) Richmond is clearly not the husband in the wedding photo. (2) He is drunker than she is.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richmond carries a vodka bottle and two tumblers. He fills them, gives one to her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They touch glasses. Down the hatch. Tight laughter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him. There's a lot of sexual tension in the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But now he begins looking around, checking things out. She spots this.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTY>
<DIRECTION>
(drunk)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay -- I told him I was sick -- anyway, he's gone -- relax...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTY>
<DIRECTION>
He nods then, more at ease. And he blows her a kiss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She catches it -- and now she starts to parade for him. Her body moving very slowly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pours himself another shot, chugs it, watches. Now --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther suddenly terrified and we find out why.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Christy, fumbling with her necklace, looks across the room --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
What she's looking at: the side table with the remote that opens the vault.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther, frozen, as Christy starts toward the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The table and the remote waiting there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther, mouth dry...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richmond, reaching out for her, then as she passes him; he takes her by the hand --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and now they are dancing, their bodies pressed together. They move slowly. She hums. He tries to get fancy, spin her with one arm --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- no good. They're too drunk for it, starts to lose balance, separate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They giggle. Smile at each other. Now Christy manages to unhook her necklace, and as she starts to drop it in the drawer of the nightstand --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther. A genuine sigh of relief --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- which suddenly dies --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Christy, as she spins toward the table again, still with the necklace in her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther, and there's nothing he can do now but watch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richmond, watching too, emptying the vodka bottle into his tumbler, chugging it down and now...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The table as Christy reaches out, grabs a remote, turns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther dead in the water because --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHRISTY'S
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
pointing the goddam thing at him --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and as she CLICKS it --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther, and for a moment, he's like a goddam deer caught in the headlights --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- but now here comes another sigh of relief and we find out why.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly there's ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING -- she's turned the STEREO ON. Christy starts humming, replaces the clicker, drops the necklace in the drawer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then they are into each other's arms. Their bodies press. Their bodies sway. He moves a hand to her breasts --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Christy breaks loose, shakes a finger at him, as if to say, "naughty, naughty" --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- then with one hand, she pulls a zipper down. The dress falls off her body. Her breasts spring free. She is wearing only her panties now and high heels. And a smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is stunning looking and she knows it and men have always gone nuts over her and she knows that too. And Richmond can't resist her either, goes to her, bends her back, caresses her neck, begins sucking her nipples. Christy moans.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther, in the chair, embarrassed, averting his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But the MOANING from the other room GROWS LOUDER, more insistent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Christy, pulling away for a moment, starting to work at Richmond's tie, shakes him out of his suit jacket, reaches for his belt, loosens it. She is working at his shirt buttons now and their breathing is audible and in a moment he is down to his boxer shorts and then her panties are off, her shoes kicked away and they are near the vault mirror now. As they approach it, they stare at themselves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther, moving farther back in his chair as their faces are just a couple of feet away --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - CLOSEUP - CHRISTY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Richmond's hands move across her wondrous body and she is hot and drifting into drunken fantasy and her eyes close and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON RICHMOND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as his eyes are open --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- the look on his drunken face is scary.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther, transfixed by that look, transfixed and worried.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - CHRISTY AND RICHMOND IN CLOSEUP - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
looking at each other now, and she is smiling happily and looking at him and he is smiling happily and looking at her, and whatever was on his face just before has gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther, watching as they turn for the gigantic canopied bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bed as they stop alongside it and kiss -- it's their first. And her arms go around his neck and she holds him like that, her eyes shut tight --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther -- watching because Richmond's eyes are not shut, they are wide open and they stare at the mirror and the awful look from before is back, only worse, and then without warning, he grips her buttocks roughly --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and slaps her hard on the ass, over and over and Christy is shocked, surprised, pulls away. Richmond smiles at her sweetly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Christy. Shaking her head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richmond. He continues to smile, makes a courtly gesture, kissing her fingertips in apology.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Christy. She smiles in acknowledgement and they move onto the bed. She pushes him down and straddles him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richmond, from her POINT OF VIEW -- a wonderfully- handsome man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Christy, from his POINT OF VIEW. A glorious, vibrant young woman. She smiles, touches her lips to a finger, reaches out, touches the finger to his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a sweet moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he reaches up, and without a word, grabs her breasts and squeezes and twists them brutally and Christy is shocked and she tries to make him stop but he won't, and she cries out in pain but he still won't stop so she slaps him in the face. He slaps her back, viciously, right in the mouth and now there is blood mixing with her lipstick and she rolls off the bed onto the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Christy sits there stunned.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTY>
<DIRECTION>
(slurred)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You fucking bastard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTY>
<DIRECTION>
And on that --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richmond, standing now, reaches down to help her up. Christy hesitates, finally takes his hand and as soon as she is on her feet --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Christy, kicking him with all she has, in the stomach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther, silently applauding.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richmond, the air momentarily out of him, falling drunkenly to the floor, stunned for just a moment and clearly in pain, but he is a big man and he is strong and he grabs her ankle, yanks, and then both are laboring on the floor and Christy kicks him again and again --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- but he will not release her ankle. Each kick only inflames his drunken rage.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHMOND>
<DIRECTION>
(very slurred --)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You little whore --
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHMOND>
<DIRECTION>
And now they both try and stand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Neither one does it gracefully, neither one does it quickly, but Richmond gets there first and as soon as he is on his feet he begins to strangle her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Christy, gasping, terrified, she claws at his arms, her fingers scratching deeply --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- but he will not let go.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She twists and jerks her body --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- no good -- he continues to tighten his grip on her throat --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and spreads his legs for better balance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bed table, as Christy, beyond desperation reaches around for something, anything -- her fingers finally close on the letter opener and in one wild stroke, she slashes his right arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now he lets go. And stares, stunned, at his bleeding arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he crunches her flush in the mouth, a brutal blow, and blood pours from her nose and mouth and if she weren't so scared, maybe it would have stopped her, but it doesn't -- because somehow she manages to maintain balance --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and knees him all she has, in the nuts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's over -- Richmond falls to the floor, helpless. He lies on his back, holding his crotch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But it isn't over. Christy, blood pouring down her face, stands over him, the letter opener still tight in her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And in her eyes you can see it, the homicidal rage --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and she drops to her knees beside him --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and Richmond can only lie there, watching her --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and she gets a better grip on the letter opener --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and Richmond still only lies there, watching her --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(2)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and she raises the letter opener slowly very high above her head, the point aimed at his heart --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and Richmond screams one time --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and as Christy starts to kill him, two well-dressed men in business suits burst through the bedroom doorway, GUNS in their hands, and they BLOW HER BRAINS OUT before the opener reaches Richmond's heart...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther, in SLOW MOTION and this is what he does --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- he reels back in the chair, eyes wide, jaw slack, mouth open --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- this is a man who has seen everything but nothing has prepared him for this --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- his arms flop over the arms of the chair, his body loses strength, he tries to look away, can't --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and this is what he sees --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Christy, fighting for another instant of life --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- no chance --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- the two bullets have shattered her brain, her eyes roll up into her head, the letter opener drops to the rug, she collapses like a rag doll --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and blood is everywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther. Back in regular motion now. Pale, barely able to breathe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two well-dressed men in business suits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILL BURTON is the more formidable. Mid-40s, he looks like a retired tight end. No body fat. Intimidating. But right now he is shaking and he can't stop it. He puts his gun away, goes to Richmond.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIM COLLIN is closing in on 30. Handsome. In wonderful shape. Burton is more physical, Collin more lethal. He puts his gun away, goes to Christy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richmond is trying to sit. He is as drunk as before but now he is also close to shock. He reaches over, manages to pick up the bloody letter opener.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kill her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHMOND>
<DIRECTION>
Collin, by the body, nods.
</DIRECTION>
<BURTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No choice in the matter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURTON>
<DIRECTION>
His words are efficient but clearly, he has been rocked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richmond, staring stupidly at the letter opener. He drops it back to the floor, tries to stand, can't. Burton helps him back to the bed. Which is when he passes out cold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Burton and Collin look at each other now.
</DIRECTION>
<BURTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, Tim, what did we do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURTON>
<COLLIN>
<DIRECTION>
(echoing Burton)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No choice in the matter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLLIN>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther, staring at it all. The shock is still there but so is something new: anger. And on that --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GLORIA RUSSELL moving through the bedroom door. Russell's 40, well-dressed, attractive and very smart. Now she sees what's happened, stops dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now she moves forward, looks at Burton and Collin. It's very clear from the outset: these three are not friendly.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
(to Burton and Collin)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you realize what a shitstorm we're in?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go on -- tell me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<COLLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing to tell. He screamed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLLIN>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you heard no sounds of violence 'til then?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<BURTON>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing we haven't heard before.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURTON>
<DIRECTION>
Richmond, on the bed, out. Russell studies his face as Burton moves toward the telephone.
</DIRECTION>
<BURTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe I should call the police now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURTON>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP - RUSSELL
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
(soft)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bill? Why don't you think about that?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat -- starting to move toward him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take a second and just think about that.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(closing in on Burton, furious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Think... real... fucking... hard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
BURTON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is strong enough to snap her neck with one hand.
</DIRECTION>
<BURTON>
<DIRECTION>
(backing away)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Probably not a good idea.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURTON>
<RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
(taking charge)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay -- here's what happened tonight -- poor Christy came home alone and interrupted a burglary. That sound logical?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther in the closet. He nods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Burton and Collin nod, too.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're going to have to sanitize this place.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(shaking Richmond)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alan, did you have sex with her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
Richmond, eyes barely open.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Don'... 'member...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHMOND>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bill, you're going to have to examine her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<BURTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm no gynecologist.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURTON>
<RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
(she takes nothing from nobody)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just made you one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
End of discussion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT (LATER)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A clock on the side table beside the three clickers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is the sound of a VACUUM -- it's later now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The place is incredibly changed. Christy is lying as before -- except now she is fully dressed. The bed has been made with clean sheets. There is a large black garbage bag that Collin shoves the sheets in, dumps in Christy's jewelry. Burton is VACUUMING the rug.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richmond is visible, still in terrible shape, finishing putting his clothes on in the open master bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone wears gloves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everything that is incriminating is gone --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- except the letter opener, which has been put in a clear plastic bag. Collin reaches for it, starts to dump it in along with the sheets and the jewelry.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll take that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<COLLIN>
<DIRECTION>
(surprised)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's got their prints on it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLLIN>
<RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
(she holds out her hand)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks for sharing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
Collin glances at Burton, shrugs, hands it over. Russell puts it in her handbag, puts the handbag on the bed table when suddenly --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richmond, careening into the room, wide-eyed, crying out --
</DIRECTION>
<RICHMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gloria -- I killed her --
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHMOND>
<DIRECTION>
Russell, turning, shocked as Richmond bears down --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- she holds out her arms for him, but he is staggering and he collides hard with her, spins against the wall, uses the bed table to try to steady himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther, stunned, staring.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
What he's staring at: the letter opener has spilled from her open purse and fallen behind the bed, out of sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Russell, calm, going to Richmond, starting to lead him from the room --
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all going to be fine, Alan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<RICHMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... But she's dead...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHMOND>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... I'll take care of everything just like I always do.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Burton and Collin)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gentlemen?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
She gestures to leave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Burton and Collin finish up -- Collin grabs the large plastic bag. Burton glances around one final time and backs toward the door, vacuuming carefully. Then --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Collin stops dead. He stares across at the bed table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther, holding his breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - BURTON AND COLLIN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<COLLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLLIN>
<BURTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURTON>
<DIRECTION>
In reply, Collin dashes back toward the bed table, grabs Russell's purse, snaps it shut, tucks it under one arm and leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Burton flicks the light out, closes the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is lit by moonlight now. Christy looks beautiful and still. HOLD for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MANSION - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's open and Russell leads a staggering Richmond outside. Two dark Towncars are parked in the driveway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Burton is behind them, turning off all lights. Collin is last, with Russell's purse, the garbage bag. As he follows them outside, he closes the front door firmly -- it makes a loud, solid sound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - LUTHER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound is barely audible. He has been looking at his watch --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The watch face is illuminated in the darkness. The second hand is fifteen seconds away from the top.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther takes a deep breath, waits in silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The WATCH face: the sound is loud, like "60 Minutes."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Burton and Russell moving with Richmond toward one of the cars. Burton takes the man in his arms, leaving Russell free to open the back door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Collin dumps the plastic bag into the trunk, shuts it, moves quickly so that he can get a decent view of the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The road in front of the house. Empty. Collin hurries to the Towncar where Burton is struggling to get Richmond comfortably stretched out on the back seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The second hand on Luther's watch hits the top and he moves into action.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- He points the clicker at the door --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- the door starts to swing open --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Luther, backpack in hand, strides quickly into the bedroom, turns, points the clicker again and as the door starts to swing shut -- Luther carefully tosses the clicker back inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - ARMCHAIR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the clicker lands -- dead-solid perfect --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther, in the bedroom, moving to the nightstand, carrying his backpack --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- he slows as he circles the body of Christy Sullivan, looks sadly down at her, continues on as we MOVE TO...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bed table. First, Luther opens the drawer and pockets the necklace. Tense, he kneels, probes behind the table, reaches farther and then -- the letter opener! In the plastic bag. Luther grabs it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He rises, opener in hand, and goes to the far window that has a view of the front of the house. He looks out, grimaces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cars are still there. Burton is visible helping Russell in. Collin hands over her purse, closes the door. He and Burton move to the front doors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther, going to the rear window. He opens the window slowly and silently. He ties one end of the rope around the leg of a heavy, wooden chest of drawers --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- now he carefully plays the knotted rope out the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SULLIVAN DRIVEWAY - TOWNCAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Collin heads to one of the Towncars. In the other Burton and Russell are getting settled in the front. Richmond lies in a stupor, stretched along the rear seat. Russell --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- a moment of relief. She breathes deep. And as Russell starts to open her purse --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - KNOTTED ROPE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as it snakes down the brick mansion -- it reaches the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther, putting his backpack on securely.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The window -- Luther glances out and down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS POV - GROUND OUTSIDE SULLIVAN MANSION - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Forty feet below. And it's dark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther -- he doesn't much like this -- but taking hold of the rope, he puts one leg out the window -- only the damn backpack makes it complicated and he's caught for a moment, clumsily trapped with one leg in, one leg out and the backpack wedged against the corner of the window --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and at that moment, there is a SCREAM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SULLIVAN DRIVEWAY/INT. TOWNCAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gloria Russell, as every nightmare she has ever had comes true -- the fucking letter opener isn't in her purse and as she screams again --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - WINDOW - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther, cursing to himself, forcing his way out the window and it isn't easy, but he makes it and then the rope slips in his hands and for one precarious moment, he is in serious trouble and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Towncar doors bursting open as Burton and Collin come barrelling out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther, getting his grip on the nylon rope again, starting to go down -- but it's difficult going for him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - FOYER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Burton and Collin tearing into the house, Collin in the lead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther in the night, thirty feet up, and he can hear COMMOTION inside the house and he tries to go faster --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- but it's not easy; the man is, after all, in his 60s and he's dangerously high and his visibility is rotten, so he's doing the best he can, but he isn't exactly flying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Russell, standing by the Towncar, staring in at the house and from the look on her face, you know she thinks her life might be over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN MANSION - STAIRCASE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Burton and Collin, racing up the second floor staircase toward the top.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther, halfway down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN MANSION - HALLWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Burton and Collin, tearing along the third floor corridor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther, ten feet off the ground now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN MANSION - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bedroom door, flying open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther, six feet to go, three, and he lets go, drops the rest of the way, hits the ground running.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Burton, racing toward the window, Collin goes to the night table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther, at the end of the house, turning a corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Burton, staring out the window and Luther is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<BURTON>

Collin, looking around the table and the letter opener is gone.

</COLLIN>
<DIRECTION>
And without another word, they bolt out the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - GROUNDS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther, crashing through the field. He is in wonderful shape --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- for a man his age.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And he gives it all he has but is it going to be enough?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SULLIVAN DRIVEWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Towncar as Collin yanks something out of the glove compartment, and then he is racing off into the night after Burton who is a few steps ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SULLIVAN DRIVEWAY/INT. TOWNCAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Russell staring after them -- in the back seat, Richmond is in a half-slumber.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - GROUNDS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther, bursting out of the underbrush --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- up ahead is the most dangerous place for him --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- one hundred yards of open field. He runs on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SULLIVAN GROUNDS - BURTON AND COLLIN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Collin catches up to the other man, tosses what he took from the glove compartment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thermal goggles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They put them on, on the fly and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THERMAL POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The world ahead of them as they see it: their FIELD OF VISION now resembles a rough computer game. THERMAL IMAGES register in red, everything else is dark green.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SULLIVAN GROUNDS - OPEN AREA - LUTHER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beginning to tire now -- and he's only halfway through the open field and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Burton and Collin, behind him, can't see him yet, but they are moving faster --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and Burton could probably destroy anyone in a fight --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- but Collin can fly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And he begins to leave Burton behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther, and twenty yards ahead of him are some woods that spur him on, he pumps his arms, his body straining and his breath coming in gasps and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Collin, graceful and young and in fabulous shape and just ahead is the open field and as he starts into it --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THERMAL POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
What Collin sees: a THERMAL figure; a man running out of the open and then disappearing into the woods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SULLIVAN GROUNDS - OPEN AREA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sight of the figure is enough to kick Collin into overdrive and he has never run this fast as he crosses the open area.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SULLIVAN GROUNDS - WOODS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther, running through the woods -- he can hear THEM now, and he knows they're closing on him and he glances back --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and smashes into a fucking tree!... hard... and it rocks him, drops him to his knees --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SULLIVAN GROUNDS - OPEN AREA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Collin and he could be jet propelled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SULLIVAN GROUNDS - WOODS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther, forcing himself back to his feet and running again, giving it everything he has left and he's dodging through the trees now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SULLIVAN GROUNDS - NEAR WOODS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Burton, behind Collin, but he draws his gun anyway --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Collin, in the woods, and his gun's drawn too --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther, out of the woods and now his car is visible --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Collin, in the woods but they're coming to an end.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THERMAL POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The figure up ahead is approaching a car.

Luther, throwing the car door open, ripping off his backpack, tossing it inside, jumping in behind the wheel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SULLIVAN GROUNDS - WOODS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Burton. Pulling up, gasping terribly. He sinks to one knee.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Collin, out of the woods! -- Still amazingly without the least sign of tiring --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and now there is a sound: a CAR MOTOR STARTING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SULLIVAN GROUNDS - LUTHER'S CAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther in his car, wheels spinning.

EXT. SULLIVAN GROUNDS - WOODS - NIGHT

Collin has his pistol ready but it's impossible to hit anything when you're running like this.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. SULLIVAN GROUNDS/INT. LUTHER'S CAR - NIGHT

Luther, in the car, GUNNING AWAY.

Collin. Slowing.

EXT. SULLIVAN GROUNDS - LUTHER'S CAR - NIGHT

The car. A swirl of dust.

<DIRECTION>
The dust clears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car rounds a corner, is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SULLIVAN GROUNDS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Collin. He stands there, rips off his thermal goggles --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and surprisingly, he smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Burton, getting to his feet, his breath still not steady. He takes his goggles off too as Collin approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<COLLIN>
<DIRECTION>
(still the smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got his license number.

<DIRECTION>
Now on that --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Russell -- back in the bedroom, with Burton and Collin who are moving around constantly, checking the place out. Things are just amazingly tense.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
(close to losing it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gee, guys, maybe it was the bogeyman -- don't forget to check under the bed --

(exploding)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- You may have buried us! --

<BURTON>
<DIRECTION>
(trying for calm)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- everybody shut up, all right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURTON>
<DIRECTION>
He is staring at his reflection in the big mirror. He crosses to it, goes to his knees, studies the rug.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rug -- indentations in the expensive carpet.
</DIRECTION>
<BURTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh boy...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURTON>
<DIRECTION>
Burton and Collin with a crowbar, working at the mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MIRROR; there is a TEAR and a POP and it swings open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All three going inside, looking around. The chair, the looted shelves. The truth thuds home.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Russell turns, looks out at the bedroom through the door.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
(dead)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A two-way mirror.
	</DIALOGUE>

Silently, they move out into the bedroom.

And on that --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WASHINGTON MUSEUM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The saddest eyes you ever saw.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's the next morning and Luther is back at the same old stand, looking at El Greco. The other art students are there too. So are the suburban housewives.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everything is as it was -- calm and peaceful --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- now a museum guard moves into the doorway, scanning the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther -- a quick glance over, then back to his sketchbook -- and from that glance it's clear all is not calm and peaceful.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The guard checks the room again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Edgy, Luther still works away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The guard leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther gets set to do the same.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RED'S BAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Red, alone in his empty bar, sipping coffee. It's before the place has opened for the day.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther comes in the back. Red slides the videocassette over, Luther pockets it.
</DIRECTION>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jordan beat us at the buzzer.

</RED>
<LUTHER>

<DIRECTION>
EXT. JOGGING PARK - PARKING AREA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A YOUNG WOMAN parking her car -- a high rocky area above the Potomac. Below, a jogging path is visible, full of runners.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Young Woman gets out, locks her car, starts down a narrow walk toward the joggers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's in her mid-thirties. A good face. And there's something familiar about her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JOGGING PARK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther, standing by the edge of the jogging path, studying the runners. Now he registers something: and smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Woman in her mid-thirties as she comes jogging along. She runs well.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther. An imperceptible straightening of his clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The jogger. We realize who she is: the little girl in the photo on Luther's dining room table. All grown up. Now her face registers something: his presence. Her eyes go down to the path, she increases her speed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther. Waving, calling out.
</DIRECTION>
<LUTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kate.
	</DIALOGUE>

	Kate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUTHER>
<DIRECTION>
She slows, hesitates, stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate, hands on hips, breathing deeply, moving to the edge of the path as he approaches. The river flows behind them. Runners pass by.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<LUTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Probably too late for me to take it up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUTHER>

She says nothing -- he gestures toward the path.

<KATE>

Luther speaks quickly now, his voice low.

<LUTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was thinking of maybe relocating. Someplace with a kinder climate.

(nothing shows on her face)

	<DIALOGUE>
	I just wanted to check it out with you first...

	<DIALOGUE>
	... you're the only family I've got.

</LUTHER>
<DIRECTION>
And on that --

Kate speaks quickly now, her voice low.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Luther, you don't have me.

The last words in this world he wanted to hear, but you can't tell from his face.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, you chose your life. You had that right. You were never around for me. Fine. But I have no plans to be around for you.

</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
And now she stops, turns away toward the path --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Luther can say nothing, watches her --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- then she spins back --
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(louder now)

INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

Christy Sullivan's body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We're back in the master bedroom but now there is a lot of police activity -- people work around the corpse. The place is covered with black fingerprint powder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SETH FRANK moves into the room -- Bogart at 40. Chief Homicide Detective of Middleton County, Virginia but he had a decade of top work in New York City. Bright, funny, and tough enough for anything you want to throw at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He kneels beside the body next to an older man. This is the MEDICAL EXAMINER, fat and bored. Seth studies Christy; sadly shakes his head.

EXT. LUTHER'S SAFE HOUSE APT. BUILDING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A high rise. It's in a different part of Washington than we've seen thus far. Afternoon now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An old salesman type is trudging into the building. He's slumped, carries heavy salesman type suitcases. He wears a battered hat. As he goes inside --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUILDING - FOYER/MAIL AREA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The salesman is opening a mail slot with the name "Hawthorne" on the outside. A good bit of mail, most of it unsolicited. Hawthorne pockets it, unlocks the foyer, heads toward the elevator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The elevator and Hawthorne slowly getting out, heading toward a corner apartment, taking out some keys --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- there are three locks on the door... he takes out keys --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LUTHER'S SAFE HOUSE APARTMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hawthorne walks in, puts the suitcases down, flings his hat toward a long sofa --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- it's Luther and this, we will come to learn, is what he keeps as his safe house. It's neatly furnished, modern and clean.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now he moves quickly --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- first he opens a suitcase -- it contains his full backpack from the robbery --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- then he opens a locked closet door, revealing a very large and sophisticated safe. As he begins to work the dial --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LUTHER'S SAFE HOUSE APARTMENT - DAY (LATER)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- the TV ON in the living room as he slides the video cassette Red gave him into his machine. Everything has been put away.

<DIRECTION>
Luther sits, nurses a beer, watches intently...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MORGUE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An old man silently weeping.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is WALTER SULLIVAN, one of the giants of the era. A self-made billionaire. Remarkably, the man has few enemies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At 80, his body may be betraying him -- he was once handsome -- but his mind is that of a young man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We've seen him before -- in the wedding picture on the wall of his mansion. With his young bride Christy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is with her again now, at the morgue. A sheet covers her body. The toe tag is visible. Walter, shattered and desolate, stares at her once joyous face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULL BACK to reveal --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MORGUE - OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY

SANDY LORD waiting in an anteroom as Walter enters...

	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. President.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANDY_LORD>
<DIRECTION>
And on those words -- The 44th President of the United States. He has all the natural charm in the world. He is remarkably bright, with a phenomenal memory. He is, also, at this moment, one of the most popular men in American history, three years into a brilliant first term, a shoo-in for re-election when that ritual comes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His name, by the way, is Alan Richmond, and we've seen him before, most recently lying drunk in the back seat of a dark Towncar.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take a walk with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHMOND>
<DIRECTION>
He and Sandy start out of the room. A well-dressed woman moves with them. She is Chief of Staff and her name is GLORIA RUSSELL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two men in suits follow behind. Burton and Collin are their names and they are the best the Secret Service has to offer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WHITE HOUSE - CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The group, as they leave the room, come to a wide corridor.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me about Walter -- how is he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHMOND>
<SANDY_LORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eighty and alone, Mr. President.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANDY_LORD>
<RICHMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He understands officially my hands are tied?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHMOND>
<SANDY_LORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. President, he's touched at your concern.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANDY_LORD>
<RICHMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Any news of the killer?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as Sandy indicates "no")
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, why isn't there? Who's in charge of the case?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHMOND>
<SANDY_LORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Top man -- eight years homicide work in New York. But I understand how you feel -- it's hard to be patient.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANDY_LORD>
<RICHMOND>
<DIRECTION>
(terribly upset)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No one understands how I feel -- I'm supposed to have all this power but I can't help my oldest friend -- you know and I know that more than any man alive Walter Sullivan put me here -- and now when he most needs me, he must feel abandoned.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHMOND>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP - RICHMOND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On fire --
</DIRECTION>
<RICHMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- I'll hold a press conference -- and I'll have Walter come -- and I will embrace him before the world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHMOND>
<DIRECTION>
Sandy. Listening. Moved.
</DIRECTION>
<SANDY_LORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He'll treasure that, Mr. President. What a generous gesture. Thank you. Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANDY_LORD>
<DIRECTION>
And he reaches out, shakes Richmond's hand, squeezes Richmond's arm and -- Richmond -- suddenly screaming in pain -- Sandy pulls back, shocked. Richmond looks embarrassed.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHMOND>
<DIRECTION>
(quick smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn tennis elbow is killing me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHMOND>
<DIRECTION>
And on that --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richmond, immediately after, and he sure isn't smiling now -- he storms toward the Oval Office, Russell, Burton and Collin hurrying to keep up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Burton opens the door for them, closes it once they're inside.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHMOND>
<DIRECTION>
(throws off his jacket, turns on Russell)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This thing's worse, Gloria. I need to see a doctor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHMOND>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The country would have to be informed, Mr. President.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<RICHMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened to my right to privacy?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(rolls up his sleeve, studies his cut)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think she nicked a tendon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHMOND>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Burton says it's a flesh wound --
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<RICHMOND>
<DIRECTION>
(to Burton)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- when did you become such an expert, Bill? -- Ever been wounded? --
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHMOND>
<BURTON>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, sir. Many times.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURTON>
<DIRECTION>
The fireplace. Richmond goes to it, rubs his arm, stares at the flames.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you serious about that press conference, Alan?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<RICHMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course I am -- Walter's been like a father to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHMOND>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shall I bring Mrs. Richmond home for it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
Richmond, turning from the fire now, quietly.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think Mrs. Richmond's mission to help the poor in Asia should not be interrupted.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(takes a breath,
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	starts to button
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
his shirt)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We know anything yet?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHMOND>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We checked his license plate -- he stole the car from a police impoundment lot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<RICHMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're not dealing with a fool here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(gestures toward his
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	jacket, as Russell
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
helps him into it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Has he initiated contact?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHMOND>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Burton doesn't think he will.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<RICHMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I agree.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(checking himself in a mirror)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry about my behavior -- won't happen again; think of it as a blip on the screen. And as far as I'm concerned, so is he.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHMOND>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He could be a little more than that, Alan -- he saw.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
Richmond. Big.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He saw nothing -- a drunk woman who liked rough sex too much. And he's a burglar. Who's going to believe him?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	After all, it's not as if he had evidence or anything...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHMOND>
<DIRECTION>
And on those words --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LUTHER'S SAFE HOUSE APARTMENT - LETTER OPENER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther holds it. It's the middle of the night. Luther turns the weapon over and over in his big hands...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WHITE HOUSE REAR GATE - NIGHT (LITTLE LATER)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Burton is alone in his car, exiting the gate and driving home. He turns onto the main road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET NEAR WHITE HOUSE/INT. BURTON'S CAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He picks up speed. Glances around -- no cars are following.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Burton reaches into his pocket, takes out a MICRO- CASSETTE RECORDER, flicks it ON.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHMOND>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened to my right to privacy?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think she nicked a tendon.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Burton clicks the cassette off, puts it back into his pocket. Drives into the night...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KATE'S APARTMENT - TINY KITCHEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A stove with one burner on high. A tea kettle is over the flame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is morning and Kate is clearly not fully awake. She is finishing making instant coffee with lowfat milk and Sweet 'n Low; next she goes to the front door of her apartment, opens it, picks up the morning Washington Post.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She unfolds the paper as she starts back to the kitchen --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT - WASHINGTON POST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Huge headlines -- as big as you can get without a war.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WALTER SULLIVAN'S WIFE MURDERED
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate looks at it only a moment, shakes her head, then starts to turn her attention to another section of the paper --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- she doesn't get that far.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate: she has seen something she didn't catch before --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The front page again. And the headline is still there --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- but there is a smaller headline beneath it:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jewel Thief Sought.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate sits down hard. Trying for control. Entering a nightmare. She stares at the paper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The front page. Pictures of the mansion, of Walter smiling on his wedding day, of Christy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But Kate's eyes keep coming back to the smaller headline:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jewel Thief Sought.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She tries to sip coffee, spills. She closes her eyes -- in the kitchen, the pot of WATER starts to SHRIEK. Kate does not move.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. VALERIE'S MIDDLE CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY (EARLY AFTERNOON)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kids riding bicycles. Very Norman Rockwell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VALERIE'S BASEMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bald man. There is the sound of a CLICK. We realize after a moment that the bald man is Luther.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another SHOT of Luther looking very different -- full beard. Again, a CLICK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther again -- elegant beard this time. CLICK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULL BACK to reveal --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are in the basement game room of one of the suburban homes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But our attention is on a whole string of Polaroids of Luther.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two people are present: Luther and VALERIE. Valerie is very small, and doesn't miss much.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She has been photographing him, and as the last photo slides out of the camera, she blows on it, puts it alongside the others.
</DIRECTION>
<VALERIE>
<DIRECTION>
(as they study the pictures)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You always did disappear good, Luther.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALERIE>
<LUTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean I've got a weak face. Thanks, Val.

</LUTHER>
<VALERIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're lucky is all -- some of my customers, they stand out no matter what.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALERIE>
<DIRECTION>
An order form book. Valerie licks a pencil with her tongue.
</DIRECTION>
<VALERIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How many passports you need?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALERIE>
<LUTHER>
<DIRECTION>
(thinks)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Four should cover it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUTHER>
<VALERIE>
<DIRECTION>
(writes this down)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now you'll want different looks, and matching international driver's licenses -- I'll throw in some dummy credit cards, seeing it's you. How the rugs I made you holding up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALERIE>
<LUTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're good. Beards and mustaches, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUTHER>
<VALERIE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I try to give value for money. Leaving the country permanent?

	It may come to that.

</VALERIE>
<LUTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Europe's fine. Maybe the Caribbean for winters. When can I pick up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUTHER>
<VALERIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Usually takes some time, but for you, I'll rush it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALERIE>
<LUTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, Val. I've always been able to count on you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUTHER>
<DIRECTION>
Valerie puts the order book down, studies him.
</DIRECTION>
<LUTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUTHER>
<VALERIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want to know what you're into, but leaving forever...

</VALERIE>
<LUTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Finish it.

</LUTHER>
<VALERIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never figured you for a runner -- thirty percent of my runners kill themselves within five years.
	</DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Five years doesn't sound so bad to me just now.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - CRIMINAL LAB - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seth and Laura in the good-sized criminal lab. Loaded with up-to-date equipment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seth has drawn a picture of the crime scene. Words like "Bedroom Door," "Exit Window," "Vault," "Bed," "Victim" are written neatly to scale. He holds a sheaf of papers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's late afternoon and things are already getting crazed. NOISE in the b.g. throughout.
</DIRECTION>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See if any of this makes sense.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>
<DIRECTION>
Seth mimes opening the "bedroom door," stepping inside, closing it. He makes a click with his tongue.
</DIRECTION>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am Christy Sullivan and I walk in and surprise a burglar.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>
<DIRECTION>
Seth moves to the "vault door," mimes closing that, makes a grunt.
</DIRECTION>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now you're the burglar coming out of the vault and being surprised.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gold star.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(aims his finger like a pistol)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I draw my gun --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>
<LAURA>
<DIRECTION>
(cutting in)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- then why do you bother to strangle her when you could just shoot?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's nothing -- why do I bother to have her strip and then put her clothes back on?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There I can help you -- see, before you were a burglar you were a dry cleaner and you still love beautiful clothes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I dress her because?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She was a good customer and you didn't want her embarrassed when the police came.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP - SETH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frustrated.
</DIRECTION>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She had a point-21 blood alcohol level. -- she was too drunk to drive. I've checked every cab and limo company in the area and not one of them knows anything. Someone drove her home. Goddamit, who? And why haven't they come forward?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe whoever drove her home killed her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You saying the burglar drove her home?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pissed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hate this case.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>
<DIRECTION>
An open door behind them. A TELEPHONE REPAIRMAN appears. Nice looking kid with a dazzling smile.
</DIRECTION>
<TELEPHONE_REPAIRMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lieutenant? -- sorry to bother you --

<DIRECTION>
(as Seth turns)

	Good service, thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>
<TELEPHONE_REPAIRMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(dazzling smile as he goes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Part of the job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TELEPHONE_REPAIRMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Seth and Laura. Seth's lost his train of thought. Then --
</DIRECTION>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yeah -- remember that bullet hole in the wall? Had the lab dig out the slug -- guess what -- no slug -- why does the burglar take the time to do that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Different from the one in her body?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<SETH>
<DIRECTION>
(getting more and more upset)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh I like that a lot -- two different guns means two different burglars. Two guys broke in? And they both went out the window? Bullshit.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(big)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And oh, by the way, why does he -- or they -- go out the window in the first place when he -- or they -- got in by breaking a zillion- dollar security system? --

(as Seth nods)
</DIRECTION>

	The minute anything breaks, if you'd call me, I'd tell the President. That way, he'd be the first to alert Mr. Sullivan -- it would mean a lot to him. And any red tape you want cut -- done.

INT. SULLIVAN DINING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quietly elegant. Two men are finishing dinner. Walter Sullivan we know.

MICHAEL McCARTY, his dinner companion, is 35, fit, handsome, beautifully dressed. He is, at present, torn by a silver tray of small French pastries.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER_SULLIVAN>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The chef makes them especially for me -- I promise you they're sinful.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Understood.

A sofa. Walter gestures for them to sit.

<WALTER_SULLIVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When I was 10 my father died -- he was a miner and lung disease killed him. I became rich at 25 and the first thing I did was purchase that mine, close it, and give every miner there fifty thousand dollars to retire on.

	You will come to Washington, Mr. McCarty. You will put one million dollars expenses into the Swiss bank account of your choosing.

INT. WASHINGTON MUSEUM - DAY

El Greco. The usual group has gathered, sketching away. Luther is deeply engrossed in his labors.

INT. MUSEUM - COFFEE SHOP - DAY

They walk in, go to the food line. There is, throughout, a bantering tone. Not that it matters, but these two, in a different world, would like each other -- they're both, in their own ways, deeply moral men.

	So, do you want my confession now or after coffee?

	Well, from what I can tell on the tube, it's not a small house.

<DIRECTION>
(as Seth nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There had to be an architect, right? You'd be able to tell which one from public records in the library. And once you know the office, you could break in and find the plans and Xerox them, get them back before morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUTHER>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not just steal them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>
<LUTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seth -- breaking in isn't hard -- what's hard is breaking in so no one knows you've been there. Now, after the architect, next you'd want the contractor's office -- and the security company's office.

And on those words --

Luther, more than he thought, a lot more -- but of course nothing shows -- instead he breaks out laughing.

<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why's that funny?

	But you see any face often enough, you'll start putting things together. That's why these top guys disguise themselves. I read a great article a couple of years back -- damn, I wish I could remember where -- anyway, it was about these makeup experts some of them use -- wigmakers, people like that.

INT. KATE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A place we've seen briefly before. Dark. Moonlight through the windows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of a KEY IN the DOOR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther enters, takes out a tiny flashlight. We're in one largish room, books all over. The home of someone who doesn't care a whole lot about their home.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther enters. He opens the fridge. Disaster -- still water, sparkling water, carrot sticks.

<DIRECTION>
(sadly, muttering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Katie darling, you've gotta try real food sometime.

He closes the door, moves back into the room --

INT. KATE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
A graduation photo of Kate. Luther touches it with a fingertip, moves on through the silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KATE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther by the bed now, he flashes his light around --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- what the light illuminates: a bed table full of law books. Expected. A phone/answering machine. The mandatory lamp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And photographs. A proud mother and daughter picture. The daughter is Kate. The mother is a fine-looking woman with a kind face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Half a dozen more shots as Kate grew up, the mother grew older. Mother and daughter, mother and daughter. Nothing unusual here at all.

<DIRECTION>
So why is Luther so sad?

HOLD.

Luther, staring at the image of Walter Sullivan, who is heartsick and beaten. Luther is simply transfixed --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Richmond on CNN and now he has turned and is beckoning for Walter Sullivan to join him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sullivan for a moment is uncertain. He points to himself -- "do you mean me?" Richmond nods, opens his arms out wide. Sullivan gets up, comes forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther, as he gets up too, also comes forward, leaving the stool, walking close to the television.

<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You finished your recruiting speech? Because I'd like to know how I handle this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<BURTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like you handled the letter opener?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURTON>
<DIRECTION>
Russell. She studies Burton. Then --
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gee, Bill, that could be construed as criticism. Do you really want me as an enemy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
Burton stands there, massively powerful. His voice, when he speaks, is his usual voice: polite, considerate.
</DIRECTION>
<BURTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miss Russell, I should have called the police that night. But I was weak. You convinced me to stay silent. I regret that.

INT. KATE'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is, we will find, a top prosecutor for the Common- wealth of Virginia. Her office is a zoo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On her desk, a baby picture of Kate and her mom smiling -- but there is something a little different about it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seth enters and they shake. He glances around --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- sees the photograph, glances away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate has risen now -- and in the silence it's clear that even though they are both standing still, they are both circling.
</DIRECTION>
<SETH>
<DIRECTION>
(trying for a smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For a tough prosecutor, you don't resemble your reputation, Miss Whitney.

</SETH>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(the same)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that good or bad?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(before Seth can reply)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Lieutenant -- I told you on the phone, I'm simply not involved with my father, so this may not be a waste of time for you, but it sure is for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What would you do if I just turned around and left?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Report you as an incompetent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<SETH>

They enter. It's empty.

<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- what? --

</KATE>
<SETH>

	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(just amazed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow -- that never crossed my mind -- you think there might be some connection? -- Like maybe I'm somehow compensating? -- I better write that down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Luther disappeared.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>
<DIRECTION>
No reaction.

	I think you can help me.

</SETH>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lieutenant -- I don't know the man -- he was in jail when I was a kid, when he got out my mother and I went off to live by ourselves. We don't make contact. He doesn't care about me. I've seen him all of once this past year.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>
<KATE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

Seth and Kate realize something: In a different world, under different circumstances, they'd probably be starting an affair.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Quit wasting my time -- if he doesn't want you to find him, you're not going to find him.

	You saying he's left town, skipped the country, what?

<KATE>

She stops.

EXT. LUTHER'S HOUSE - DAY

The row of small, neat houses -- where Luther lived.

Kate and Seth get out of his car, go to the front door.

<KATE>

	How long did he live here?

EXT. LUTHER'S FRONT DOOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seth stoops, gets the key from under the terra cotta planter.

	Strange place for a thief to leave a key, don't you think?

</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LUTHER'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They enter. It's surprisingly tidy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seth and Kate as they move along. Seth is watching Kate who suddenly stops dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The mantle. A large blowup of the same picture Kate had in her office, the one of Kate and her mom --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- with one startling change: Luther is in this shot, standing there proud and smiling. She has ripped his presence out of her photo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seth, silently watching Kate. She turns sharply away. He gestures for her to follow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LUTHER'S BEDROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They enter. Clothes tossed all over.
</DIRECTION>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He sure took off in a hurry. What scares a professional thief like that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>
<DIRECTION>
Kate. No reply. She has seen something across the tiny room and is drawn to it --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther's bed table --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and here it is!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Call it a montage, call it a collage, call it what you will, we are looking at dozens of photographs --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- all of them featuring Kate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Many of them we saw in her apartment -- only here, as in the photo over the mantle, Luther is there with Kate and her mom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are looking at a shrine!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And there are newer photos too -- Kate at her college graduation, Kate at her law school graduation, Kate and her mother coming out of an elegant restaurant, Kate alone on the steps of Middleton County Courthouse --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- these are not posed shots.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks wonderful and alive in all of them --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate. She looks dead now. All energy gone. She sits heavily down on the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(fighting tears)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... but he wasn't at those places...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing to the grown-up photos)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... college graduation; law school graduation; the night Mom and I celebrated when I got a job; and me alone on the steps? -- I'd just won my first case, I was so proud...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(still fighting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... I used to think... sometimes I'd come home and I'd sense he'd been in my apartment, checking the fridge, shaking his head because he never thought I ate right... It's crazy but I just knew Daddy was watching over me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
And now she loses it, starts crying silently.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seth kneels alongside her, gives her a handkerchief.
</DIRECTION>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can do a good thing, Kate --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)

Kate, staring at the photos, trying to get control.
</DIRECTION>
<SETH>
<DIRECTION>
(moving in)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kate, he's on the run and he's scared and he's right to be scared because he's going to get caught -- you don't know the heat on this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's not a murderer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe you're right. Maybe he is innocent. If so I'll have him home and dry in a few hours. But what happens if some hotshot who's trying to make a reputation tracks him down?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)

	<DIALOGUE>
	I can guarantee his safety. You make the call, I make a promise: You'll have your father, home and dry...

Kate alone. Totally wiped out. She is on the phone with Seth. Outside, the sun is dying.

EXT. FIRING RANGE - DAY (EARLY MORNING)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Burton, yawning, blowing into a steaming paper cup of coffee. Collin, wide awake, moves alongside. Collin is carrying a rifle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- we are at a government firing range.

Collin squints into the morning sun.
</DIRECTION>

Burton, putting down the coffee cup, picking up a pair of binoculars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Burton and Collin staring out --

Collin. He strokes the barrel of his high-powered rifle.

CUT TO:

COLLIN

with his rifle. His fingers still move along the barrel. No hurry whatsoever --

<DIRECTION>
Burton, dazed.

EXT. CAFE ALONZO BUILDING - THREE CURSING WORKMEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULL BACK to reveal the workmen are on a scaffolding two stories up, struggling to replace a glass panel that has cracked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The glass panel is heavy and bulky and the workmen are having a bitch of a time with it.

The entire front of the building is glass panels. It mirrors the area across the street -- a bunch of dilapidated brownstones.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BROWNSTONES ACROSS FROM CAFE ALONZO - DAY

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS DEBRIEFING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seth, taut and businesslike, stands by a blown-up map of the Cafe Alonzo area. The restaurant is circled -- and around it are marked places for policemen to wait -- Seth is giving instructions to those policemen now --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- fifty of them. And no one's smiling.
</DIRECTION>

INT. KATE'S APARTMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate. Dressed and ready. Lying on her bed. Afternoon now. She gets up, makes it halfway to the front door --

	The Boss is very grateful. Thanks.

INT. CAFE ALONZO BUILDING - LOBBY

Around and behind them, dozens of cops get in position.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Come again?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHMOND>
<DIRECTION>
This time she touches it -- he bends close to her.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sent it to me this afternoon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
Long pause -- then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP - RICHMOND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
So happy.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, of course.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(now, to the others)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me, all -- I am overcome with the desire to dance with my Chief of Staff.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHMOND>
<DIRECTION>
A hand to her -- Russell, beaming, moves out onto the dance floor with him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone at the gathering, watching them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richmond and Russell, very much aware that all eyes are on them --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- what we don't know is this: they are both wonderful dancers. And they seem to be reveling in their moves --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- because throughout this, they never stop smiling.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is this nonsense? I'm hoping there's an explanation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHMOND>
<DIRECTION>
(2)
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
(surprised)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your gift, Alan -- I was overwhelmed -- and your note was so gratifying --
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<RICHMOND>
<DIRECTION>
(cutting in)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- I sent a note?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHMOND>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, yes, you think I don't know your writing? I assumed you wanted me to wear it tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
The necklace. He looks at it as they spin gracefully.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is lovely, Gloria -- and you know what else?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHMOND>
<DIRECTION>
They do a perfect dip.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What, Alan?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<RICHMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Christy Sullivan wore it the night she was killed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHMOND>
<DIRECTION>
Russell, a quick glint of panic, a gentle peal of feminine laughter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richmond and Russell -- he bends her back, their mouths are close.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You realize what this means? Whitney's been heard from.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHMOND>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP - RUSSELL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They spin and glide. Long pause. Then --
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not precisely the first time, Mr. President.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
The MUSIC is BUILDING TO CLIMAX now. Their movements become more grand.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHMOND>
<DIRECTION>
(so happy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've been keeping things from me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHMOND>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only because you have so much on your plate, Alan; we wanted to spare you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He sent me a Polaroid of the letter opener yesterday.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP - RICHMOND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A kick in the teeth --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- he summons all his control, goes into even more complicated movements.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd of elegant men and women, it's really wonderful dancing they're seeing -- they start to applaud.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richmond and Russell, hearing the sound. Richmond acknowledges it with a smile as they come to climax.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, now --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a final flourish)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- I need time to think -- come see me in my office in the morning --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This will certainly make for an interesting chapter in my memoirs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHMOND>
<DIRECTION>
And as they bow...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd applauding louder, while on the dance floor, the President of the United States and the Chief of Staff applaud happily back. As the sound builds --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BURTON'S HOUSE - ROOF - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther in the night. Silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is moving across the rooftop of a home. He carries a briefcase -- Luther's making business calls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ahead is an attic window -- as he slides it open --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BURTON'S HOUSE - ATTIC - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther, slipping inside. Some stairs are just across. He goes down them, opens the door --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BURTON'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther stepping into the main part of the dark house. He stops. No noise at all except that of someone BREATHING DEEPLY, coming from an open bedroom door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther passes by -- for an instant we can see that Burton is asleep, an empty bottle by his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COLLIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther rounding a corner --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and we can tell immediately he's in a different house now. Burton's had only old furnishings, these are modern and new.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther pauses, listening. Nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He moves forward then, turns another corner --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RUSSELL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and now we can tell he's someplace else -- this is an apartment with a large window looking out on the city.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther doesn't stop to admire the view. He moves silently on...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HOLD ON the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And suddenly: Dawn -- the sun is starting to rise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULL BACK to reveal --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RUSSELL'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gloria Russell, as the ALARM GOES OFF. She sits --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- she stretches --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- then she stares -- something has been taped to her lamp. We are looking at an issue of the Washington Post -- Russell's photo smiles out -- there is a headline that says simply: RUSSELL TO BE CHIEF OF STAFF.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Written across her picture are the words: "This shitstorm is your fault -- if we go down, you go down!" Russell takes the paper down, stares at it. Furious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BURTON'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Burton, hung over, staggering into the kitchen of his home, stopping dead. A newspaper is set beside his coffee pot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A front page of the Washington Post. Years back. The lead article reports that a siege has been successfully broken --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Burton, bloody and wounded, is being carried to an ambulance. A hero. Across the top these words have been written:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN, YOU GUTLESS FUCK?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Burton stares. Steaming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COLLIN'S HOUSE - BATHROOM - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Collin, yawning, going into his bathroom --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- across his mirror is taped a large white piece of paper, across which is written in thick black marker -- "If you could shoot for shit, we'd be out of this."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Collin angrily rips it down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DOWNTOWN NEWSSTAND - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bunch of commuters and businessmen are buying papers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The newspapers. Washington, New York, Philadelphia -- and they're all different front pages, of course, but one photo in all of them is the same --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- every one of them is running the mug shot of Luther. And the sense of the stories is the same too:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HAVE YOU SEEN THIS MAN?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COMMUTERS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
crowded around, making their purchases. Some of them are young, some of them are half asleep. One of them is in his 60's and very wide awake --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- it's Luther --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- as he buys a paper, looks at the headline -- fascinated.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BURTON'S OFFICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Still early morning -- Collin is going through Burton's desk hurriedly --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- when Burton surprises him --
</DIRECTION>
<BURTON>
<DIRECTION>
(pissed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURTON>
<COLLIN>
<DIRECTION>
(closes the desk, shrugs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Needed a pen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLLIN>
<BURTON>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing to his desktop)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's pens --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(moving in)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- you don't trust me? --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURTON>
<COLLIN>
<DIRECTION>
(pissed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- I don't answer to you, asshole --
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLLIN>
<DIRECTION>
Russell in the doorway now, glaring at them.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're both assholes, now move --
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
And on that --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OVAL OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The note that was sent to Russell and the Polaroid of the letter opener.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULL BACK to reveal --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Polaroid and the note are on Richmond's desk. He studies them. Russell, Burton and Collin stand silently watching him, their hatred of each other clear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The smell of death's in the room.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHMOND>
<DIRECTION>
(holding the note now,
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	his voice is, when he
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
speaks, calm; to Burton)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Any idea who could have forged it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHMOND>
<BURTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I talked to Seth Frank -- apparently Whitney learned how in prison.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURTON>
<RICHMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very gifted man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHMOND>
<DIRECTION>
The window as he walks to it, looks out.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And are we close to stopping him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHMOND>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're working round the clock.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<RICHMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good to know that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHMOND>
<BURTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He'll make a mistake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURTON>
<RICHMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good to know that too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHMOND>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP - RICHMOND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With more meaning than the words convey --
</DIRECTION>
<RICHMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is one other thing you'll want to take care of.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHMOND>
<DIRECTION>
The other three, looking at Richmond.
</DIRECTION>
<BURTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're sure you want to do that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURTON>
<RICHMOND>
<DIRECTION>
(nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's a young prosecutor, prosecutors ask questions -- she might know what he knows...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a reassuring smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's get cracking, shall we?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Show you love your country.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHMOND>
<DIRECTION>
On those words --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KATE'S APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate Whitney, getting into the elevator. Off to work. She pushes for the lobby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The doors close and the elevator starts down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELEVATOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate checks her purse to see if she has everything.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT - ELEVATOR BUTTON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The "L" is lit --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- but when the elevator gets there, it does not stop but goes straight on down to the basement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELEVATOR - KATE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
That's strange. She instinctively moves to the rear of the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ODD SOUNDS from the basement. Kate's just the least bit tense.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELEVATOR IN BASEMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ODD SOUNDS are LOUDER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And the doors don't open when they should.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELEVATOR - KATE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
and now she's starting to get a little scared.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BASEMENT - ELEVATOR DOORS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The doors sliding open and the Super standing there with tools.
</DIRECTION>
<SUPER>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, Miss Whitney, but this thing's giving us a little trouble.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUPER>
<DIRECTION>
Kate nods, smiles back, relieved.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. KATE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate, leaving her building, going toward her car, getting in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Down the block is a police car. Two surveillance cops inside. Kate starts to drive -- and so do they.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate turns a corner --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and so do they --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and as they do, they pass Luther, parked on the corner. Watching. Satisfied, he drives off in another direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OUTER CITY ROAD (WASHINGTON) - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther, heading out of the city. The sun is higher in the sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Several cars. Traffic is moving slowly. Luther continues to drive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. KATE'S OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate, coming out of her office building, hurrying along the sidewalk. Lunch hour.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She goes past some brownstones -- the two cops walk behind --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- the window of one of the brownstones is open, shadowy movement from inside --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Kate hurries past, not paying attention... Cops don't either.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BROWNSTONE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now a figure begins to appear in the window --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The figure holds something long and thin, like a rifle barrel --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- it's a large woman with a long mop -- as she shakes it --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Afternoon and the sun is strong.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sunlight, streaming in an open bedroom window. Whose bedroom, though?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two maids are cleaning it --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and now we realize where we are: Walter Sullivan's bedroom, but it's all been changed, different rug, different fabrics, different furnishings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The maids work silently and well. A final sweep of a dust rag here, a last tug at the bedspread there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Done. They go to the door, take a last look around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Perfect.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They go.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HOLD ON the empty room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Keep HOLDING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now, silently, the vault door opens -- a gardener steps out, clicker in hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The gardener -- it's Luther -- he clicks it, tosses it back inside --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- the door starts to close --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- but before it shuts, we can see he's returned what he took the night of the robbery.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And as he moves silently toward the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GAS STATION (WASHINGTON CITY LIMITS) - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The outskirts of Washington. Mid-afternoon now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther's at a pay phone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SETH'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seth, as he picks up the phone --
</DIRECTION>
<LUTHER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kate okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUTHER>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PAY PHONE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther. Fast.
</DIRECTION>
<LUTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not staying on long enough for you to track this, just answer me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUTHER>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SETH'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She couldn't be in better hands -- talk about catching a break, Secret Service called me. They're taking over surveillance --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PAY PHONE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The telephone swinging back and forth --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and in the b.g., a car MOTOR ROARING away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KATE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - ELEVATOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate, coming down the elevator again -- in her jogging clothes now. She has pushed the lobby button.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The elevator stops suddenly on the second floor --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- The Super gets in, smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<SUPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Got it working fine, Miss Whitney.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUPER>
<DIRECTION>
Kate nods, smiles back --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WASHINGTON STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther, driving like crazy through the city.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. KATE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate, getting into her car in front of her building, driving off -- no one is behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WASHINGTON - ANOTHER STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther, HONKING his HORN as he barrels around a corner, scattering traffic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JOGGING PARK ENTRANCE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate drives into the park past a sign reading: "PARKING LOT."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROAD NEAR JOGGING PARK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther, gunning along -- up ahead the park is visible now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JOGGING PARK - PARKING LOT - ENTRANCE ROAD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate, following an arrow that leads to the parking lot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther, in the park, now, suddenly shouting "Shit" as we --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JOGGING PARK - PARKING LOT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A "DETOUR" sign.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate, entering the parking lot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JOGGING PARK - PARKING LOT AREA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther, out of his car now, running like crazy through the park. Ahead is a sign saying: "JOGGING PATH."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JOGGING PARK - PARKING AREA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Not many other cars so she gets a space in front, overlooking the river, and as she stops, takes out her keys --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BURTON AND COLLIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Collin at the wheel, ROARING in behind her, rear-ending her hard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- there is a SCREECH of BRAKES and a SCREAM --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JOGGING PARK - TRAIL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther as he hears the terrible sound, keeps running.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARKING LOT - INT. KATE'S CAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate in her car as it teeters at the edge and then starts its long fall to the jogging path far below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JOGGING PARK - PARKING AREA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Burton and Collin in their car, driving like hell away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JOGGING PARK - TRAIL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther, running INTO VIEW, stopping dead, helpless now, staring at the worst thing in the world --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OMITTED
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JOGGING PARK CLIFF - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate's car, careening against a rocky ledge, then cart wheeling the rest of the way down, landing horribly, spinning, finally coming to rest upside down and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BOTTOM OF CLIFF - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luther running to the car; hands shaking, he manages to pull front door open and reach inside --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- now there are cries as other joggers stop and stare and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate, as Luther pulls her body out of the wreckage.
</DIRECTION>
<LUTHER>
<DIRECTION>
(terrified)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Kate...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUTHER>
<DIRECTION>
-- no response -- it's impossible to tell if she's alive --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- in the distance now, the sound of an AMBULANCE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WASHINGTON HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ENTRANCE - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The AMBULANCE, SIREN SCREAMING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULL BACK to reveal --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Early evening now, getting dark, and the ambulance braking in front of the emergency room of a large city hospital --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- as doctors and attendants with gurneys come pouring out --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WASHINGTON HOSPITAL - KATE'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A private room. Later. Kate is bandaged and attached to a bunch of equipment --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- but however faintly her breathing, it's still breathing and it's steady. She's alone for the moment in the semi-darkened room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Empty. A doctor comes walking along -- it's Collin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL - KATE'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate in her room, sleeping. Another doctor is with her now, checking her charts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Collin. He sees what's going on, stops, pulls out a small notebook, pretends to read it, all the while glancing toward Kate's room with the one doctor still there --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- now from around the corner, NOISE, COMING CLOSER -- SEVERAL PEOPLE APPROACHING, perhaps more.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Collin turns away from the sound, curses, then stops --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- The doctor is done with Kate's charts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From around the corner now, the group coming closer still.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate's doorway as the doctor exits and Collin enters -- they pass each other --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL - KATE'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Collin moves a step further into the room --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and now there is something in his hand --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- a hypodermic needle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate. Out of it. Lying there, eyes closed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Collin, the needle ready, moving silently toward the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate is barely breathing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And now suddenly Collin is barely breathing --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- because the other doctor's arms have viced around Collin's neck, forcing the air out of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Collin, stunned, trying to struggle --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The doctor jerking Collin's body into the air -- his feet are dangling now -- the hypodermic needle drops to the bed as the struggle goes on --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and Collin's in fabulous shape. He's young and power- ful and he's been in terrible situations before and he knows how to fight and he's been taught to defend himself and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- tough shit --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- the doctor -- it's Luther -- relentlessly increases the pressure against Collin's throat --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Collin can't even gasp now --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- his feet can't kick anymore --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- his body starts to go limp --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- his eyes start to slide up into his head --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- silence in the room --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- it's almost over --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- which is when suddenly Luther lets go.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Collin, eyes flickering open as Luther lays him down on the floor. All this next is whispered.
</DIRECTION>
<LUTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Scream. Go on. Which do you want most, for me to kill you or life in jail forever?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUTHER>
<DIRECTION>
He has gone across the room to the bed. Collin tries to move, can't.
