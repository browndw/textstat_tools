EXT. OSSINING CORRECTIONAL FACILITY - EARLY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mist shrouds the prison.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
C.U. - EYES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Closed. Then the lids fly wide open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CELL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An ASIAN MAN sits up on his cot, coming out of sleep with a gasp. SHU KAI KIM is in his late 20s. With a muscled torso and shaved head meant to inspire fear. And to hide it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CELLBLOCK - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The electrified doors slide OPEN. Shu steps out of his cell. ORTEGA -- a rugged young Chicano -- steps out of a nearby cell. The two cons trade small nods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CONS walk in single file. Ortega is behind Shu. Ortega speaks softly, with barely perceptible lip movement.
</DIRECTION>
<ORTEGA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fear will kill you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ORTEGA>
<DIRECTION>
Shu's replies are like a ventriloquist's, as well. The two men are running through some sort of arcane drill.
</DIRECTION>
<SHU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not afraid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHU>
<ORTEGA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know I'd stand in for you... But then, believing you are weak, they'd come for you anyway.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ORTEGA>
<SHU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I want this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHU>
<ORTEGA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. Right after chapel... it's going down in the yard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ORTEGA>
<DIRECTION>
Now Shu and Ortega file into:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PRISON CHAPEL - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the dais, the MINISTER leads a small CONVICT CHOIR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE - THE CONGREGATION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cons have segregated themselves into sullen groups of black, white, and brown.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE - FOUR CONS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the rear. SHU is flanked by TWO stringy CHICANOS. Ortega sits behind Shu. All four stare ahead with an intense blankness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - FROM THE SIDE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now we see what's really happening: Shu grips two sharpened spoons. The Chicanos wrap duct tape around Shu's fists -- so that even if he wanted to, he couldn't let go of the knives.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - A WHITE CON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In front. DUANE LINDEMAN is burly, with long blond locks, his arms decorated with SWASTIKAS. Tattooed on one cheek are three black teardrops. Lindeman is surrounded by OTHERS like him. All SINGING a hymn to the Lord Jesus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THROUGH THE CHAPEL DOORS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A disturbance out in the hall: we hear THUMPS, loud CURSING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DUANE LINDEMAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
and FRIENDS just keep on singing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rest of the Congregation turns around, to see what's going on. The TWO CORRECTIONS OFFICERS at the rear of the Chapel venture to the door and peer out, truncheons drawn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO WHITE INMATES spring out of opposing back row aisle seats and SLAM SHUT the Chapel doors on the C.O.s -- who immediately start POUNDING on the doors with their STICKS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ONSTAGE - A hulking WHITE member of the CHOIR discreetly moves to block the fire exit offstage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHU AND ORTEGA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
turn back around to face what appears at first glance to be a grotesque apparition:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DUANE LINDEMAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
seems to be flying from the front of the chapel toward them, blond hair flowing, arms waving, a warlock...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In fact, he's racing from the top of one pew-back to the next -- and his HANDS are duct-taped, too, around not sharpened spoons, but long, serrated blades.
</DIRECTION>
<ORTEGA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Motherfuckers! Not in here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ORTEGA>
<DIRECTION>
A SIREN WAILS as Lindeman leaps at Shu -- who executes a perfectly timed karate throw, sending Lindeman over his shoulder to land sprawling in the aisle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lindeman's tattooed ACCOMPLICES move to help. Ortega holds them off. Before Lindeman can right himself, Shu pins the blond Goliath. Brings a fist to Lindeman's neck, sharpened spoon pressed against the neo-Nazi's jugular.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Outraged, the MINISTER claws his way through the crowd of rubbernecking cons.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shu is breathing too hard to demand that Lindeman concede. But his message is clear. Now, in gasps:
</DIRECTION>
<LINDEMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kill... me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDEMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Instead, Shu lifts the sharpened spoon away from Lindeman's neck. Carefully climbs off, steps back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lindeman lies there defeated. Then looses a startling banshee SCREAM and springs, blades flashing, at Shu.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They're like two snarling cats. Wrestling so furiously, we see only a blur of flesh, glint of metal. Splash of blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A RING of INMATES forms around the combatants. Some CHEER, others SHOUT for the fight to stop. None dare interfere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now the BACK DOORS virtually fly off their hinges as a HALF- DOZEN C.O.s in RIOT GEAR charge the Chapel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It takes all six to drag the bloody cons apart. Shu immediately goes limp; Duane Lindeman is slack, twitching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Horrified, the Minister backs off, vestments soaked in gore.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JFK AIRPORT - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CAB merges onto the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AERIAL SHOT - MANHATTAN ISLAND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We PAN to the Brooklyn Bridge and PICK UP the CAB as it hits Mannattan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAB
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the back seat, face pressed to the glass, is ROGER BARON. A 25-year-old whose persona straddles two worlds: In his Brooks Brothers suit he'd be welcome in any boardroom. With his Buddy Holly glasses and conceptually cropped hair, he's someone you'd want in your band. Roger checks his watch.
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could I give you some extra money, have you drop me at the Courthouse and bring my luggage to the hotel?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<DIRECTION>
The CABBIE turns around, at a red light. No creepier than the average New York Cabbie. He is smiling.
</DIRECTION>
<CABBIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No problem.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABBIE>
<DIRECTION>
Roger smiles back. Big problem.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. 100 CENTRE STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Manhattan's fortress-like Criminal Courts Building. Roger climbs out of the cab, lugging a suitcase, a briefcase, a duffel bag and a garment bag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
To a COURT OFFICER:
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm looking for the court where Edward T. Dowd is defending a Mr. Nevins.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<DIRECTION>
The Court Officer consults the docket sheet.
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the Edward Dowd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<DIRECTION>
The Court Officer blinks at Roger.
</DIRECTION>
<COURT_OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Part 73, Room 1113.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COURT_OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
Then, deadpan:
</DIRECTION>
<COURT_OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the Room 1113.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COURT_OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COURTROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An Assistant D.A. stands before the JURY, in mid-summation.
</DIRECTION>
<D_A>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Edward Dowd is an inventive lawyer. I'm sure he'd like you to believe that the pound of pure cocaine found in his client's home was intended for personal, recreational use.
	</DIALOGUE>
</D_A>
<DIRECTION>
Several JURORS stifle snickers.
</DIRECTION>
<D_A>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He may claim that the many pounds of baby laxative were intended to help Mr. Nevins stay regular.
	</DIALOGUE>
</D_A>
<DIRECTION>
More muted SOUNDS of amusement, from the gallery, as Roger ENTERS. He quietly deposits his luggage in the empty back row, then moves to the front row, behind the defense table. Seated there is a slick, natty DEFENSE ATTORNEY. Next to him is a wired and weird-looking DEFENDANT in a threadbare suit, the cut decades out of date.
</DIRECTION>
<D_A>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What will Mr. Dowd say the defendant weighed on his laboratory scales? Oh, he'll think of something... But bear in mind that you jurors control the scales that really count -- the scales of justice. Only you can ensure that the defendant -- a man who sells dangerous drugs to teenagers, for profit...
	</DIALOGUE>
</D_A>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - THE DEFENDANT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
winces. He's in his mid-40s, his face framed by a MANE of HAIR that hangs to his shoulders. His vintage suit accented by an embarrassingly wide and loud floral-print tie.
</DIRECTION>
<D_A>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...will pay a penalty. Be wise, be fair, and have courage. Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</D_A>
<DIRECTION>
As she crosses to the Prosecution Table:
</DIRECTION>
<JUDGE_BAUM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Ms. Jessum. Mr. Sweeney, may I have a word with you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE_BAUM>
<DIRECTION>
As Mr. Sweeney -- the Court Officer -- confers with the Judge, Roger leans forward. Whispers to the Defense Attorney:
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Roger Baron. Sorry I'm late.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<DIRECTION>
The Defense Attorney looks mildly baffled. Regardless, Roger extends a hand.
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is an honor. And a thrill.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<DEFENSE_ATTORNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEFENSE_ATTORNEY>
<DIRECTION>
But what the hell: he shakes with Roger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now the DEFENDANT turns, to see what's going on. Trying to breathe as much empathy as he can into the one syllable:
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<DIRECTION>
The Defendant has fixed Roger with the sort of soul-piercing stare it takes many acid trips to perfect. So, delicately:
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What're you, um, accused of?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<DEFENDANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All sorts of things. How 'bout you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEFENDANT>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me? N-no, I'm a lawyer, I'm here to work with Mr. Dowd...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<DIRECTION>
Nodding at the Defense Attorney. We HEAR a POUNDING gavel.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDGE_BAUM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Dowd, would you care to make your closing argument?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE_BAUM>
<DIRECTION>
Roger pats the Defendant's shoulder. Reassures:
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're in good hands.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<DIRECTION>
The Defendant lifts his eyebrows, as though to say "Is that so?" Turns back around. And, for some reason, he rises.
</DIRECTION>
<DEFENDANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would, your Honor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEFENDANT>
<DIRECTION>
ROGER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Confused, at first -- then mortified: omigod, that's Dowd!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EDWARD C. DOWD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
takes three long, crooked strides over to the Jury Box, hands clasped behind his back, hair streaming.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Brian Nevins' pound of pure cocaine was quite clearly intended for sale.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
The JURORS look surprised. So does the D.A. So does BRIAN NEVINS.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The baby laxative -- dealers use it to dilute their coke before selling it. They can -- quadruple their profits...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
NEVINS throws a jittery glance at the jury.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and of course you can't sell cocaine without a laboratory scale.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie strikes a tone of cosmic lamentation.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cocaine is evil. Selling cocaine is evil.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Nevins checks his mental Rolodex for a great appeals lawyer.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pity this foolish merchant. Dislike him if you must. But despise the tactics the police employed to snare Brian Nevins... Don't lose sight of what's really on trial here -- our basic personal freedoms, our quality of life...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
"Freedoms" and "life" are rendered as startling SHOUTS that make the Jurors sit up straight.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sublime concepts, such as "the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures..."
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie's delivery suggests an unholy but hard-to-dismiss hybrid of rabbi and diva.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For when we condone the bugging of our citizens' bedrooms, when we allow the police to enter our citizens' homes with specious warrants, when we invade our citizens' privacy in a frenzied quest for a wicked white powder, aren't we capitulating to the evil, aren't we surrendering to the drug? Aren't we saying cocaine is more potent than our Constitution?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COURTHOUSE - AFTERNOON - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roger maintains a discreet distance behind Eddie and Nevins as lawyer and client stroll down the steps.
</DIRECTION>
<NEVINS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow, that speech... It was beautiful. Amazing horseshit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEVINS>
<EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
(tight smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Amazing client.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Nevins isn't sure how to respond. So he gives Eddie a quick, vigorous, almost hostile hug.
</DIRECTION>
<NEVINS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eddie Dowd... Everybody should own one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEVINS>
<DIRECTION>
OMIT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nevins spins away, hops into his girlfriend's double-parked Porsche. As the happy couple blasts off down the block, Roger draws even with Eddie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OMIT
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	About the mix-up back there... I, ah, never saw your photo, I just read every civil liberties brief you filed in the '60s...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie distractedly nods. Then rotely sticks out his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, it was nice meeting ya. Gotta get back to the office.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
It takes Roger a beat to realize the awful truth.
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Roger Baron, Oberlin undergrad, Michigan Law? None of this rings a bell?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<DIRECTION>
Exactly. Amused, now, by the absurd series of missteps:
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You hired me? To clerk for you? My letter...? Top 5 percentile, Law Review, salary is no object...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<DIRECTION>
This last detail apparently jogs Eddie's memory.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
They start trudging to the subway station. Roger awkwardly lugs his suitcase, garment bag, duffel bag and briefcase.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here, lemme help you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs the briefcase.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SHERIDAN SQUARE - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Several streets converge here; so do gays, yuppies, and diehard bohemians. As Eddie and Roger emerge from the IRT station, and cross 7th Avenue:
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...read your Chase Manhattan bombing case summation in the '71 Leftist Law anthology...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie lives and works over a landmark cigar store and an eyesore of an all-night deli. As he unlocks the downstairs door, Roger takes in the seedily picturesque Square.
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So this is Greenwhich Village?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie smiles. Somewhere between sarcastic and self-effacing:
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes Roger. You've arrived.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
He starts up the stairs. Roger follows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LAW OFFICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Balding rugs, macrame hanging things, birdcages, Salvation Army couches. TWO leather-clad SCARECROWS pace; a teenage GIRL with blue hair squats on the floor, comforting her SQUALLING INFANT. Then there's the slick young COUPLE in Ralph Lauren Polo ensembles, here with a furtive STRAIGHT- ARROW who scans the Wall Street Journal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A crew-cutted secretary (BILLY) types with one hand, grabs the RINGING PHONE with the other. To judge by her typing and telephone skills, she was hired for her capacity to manage this menagerie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roger has struggled up the stairs, behind Eddie. Though he quickly notes the office's squalor and questionable clientele, what catches his eye is the trio of cracked and yellowing PHOTOGRAPHS tacked on a wall in the foyer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie in his late-'60s glory days: On a dais, igniting an anti-war rally. Hugging a pair of Black Panthers outside a courtroom, his face suffused with joy. In a swarm of student activists outside a Federal courthouse, held on the shoulders of the crowd like a conquering hero.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As his gaze lingers on the photographs:
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and re-read that summation til I knew it verbatim. You were my age when you defended that case.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie edgily pushes Roger past the photos.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was never your age.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
The SCARECROWS clamor for Eddie, e.g., "You gotta call my parole officer!" and "Did we get the continuance?" Eddie ignores. Addresses his secretary.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Billy -- this here's Roger, the new assistant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie wheels away, answers the RINGING PHONE (grunting a perfunctory promise into it), then gestures for Straight- Arrow and Slick Couple to come into his inner office. Roger starts to follow, but Eddie shuts his inner office door behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to be an "assistant" or an "associate"?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<DIRECTION>
Roger turns to see Billy tugging on her denim jacket.
</DIRECTION>
<BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some of them like "assistant," some like "associate". Up to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- How many others are there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<DIRECTION>
As Billy, wearing a slight smirk, bustles out the door:
</DIRECTION>
<BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're the current one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<DIRECTION>
Roger wistfully watches her go. OS, he HEARS:
</DIRECTION>
<MAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You Eddie's new partner?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
SCARECROW 1 is standing a tad too close for comfort. Still, Roger is grateful for the attempt at friendliness.
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not exactly. Well, kind of.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<DIRECTION>
Roger flinches, lets out an involuntary YELP as Scarecrow grabs his lapels, shakes him.

	You gotta call my parole officer!

INT. COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR - DAY - A FEW WEEKS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A spruce ASSISTANT D.A. (GLENN FULTON) jauntily exits a courtroom. Followed by a grim-faced Eddie, with Roger and CLYDE GRUNER, a sullen, street-hardened PUNK.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>

</EDDIE>
<FULTON>

	I had a minute before the Mapp hearing -- but I couldn't get you on the phone, Eddie...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FULTON>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, well I had reasonable cause to believe the judge might've heard of the Fourth Amendment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
We TRACK with Fulton, Eddie and Roger as they thread through the THRONG of milling lawyers, clients, relations and cops.
</DIRECTION>
<FULTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey -- Gruner was caught with three pounds of methedrine. The legality of the search and seizure was the only issue. The Judge refused to exclude the evidence. No deal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FULTON>
<DIRECTION>
He turns a corner. So does Eddie.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No it's not the only issue. There's another issue, for the jury. What about entrapment?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<FULTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about entrapment?

Fulton veers into the Men's Room. Eddie follows.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roger enters, behind Eddie.

<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Glenn, the government sent an undercover cop to dangle the lure of fantastic profits before Clyde Gruner's eyes. Anyone so sorely tempted might succumb!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Roger lingers at the sink as Eddie follows Fulton to the urinals.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We don't prosecute people because in the abstract they might be weak. Judge Brandeis said it best: Entrapment is a "dirty business!"
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<FULTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't I take a simple piss without --
	</DIALOGUE>
</FULTON>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie's voice trembles with outrage and inspiration.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you see? Planting the idea of being a criminal is just one step away from planting the evidence!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Fulton flushes. Grudgingly:
</DIRECTION>
<FULTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Haven't heard that one before, Ed.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(zips up, sighs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I guess I'll be hearing it again.

Roger backs out of the bathroom.

At this hour, the office is empty. As EDDIE and ROGER enter:

	Nevins stopped by. It's on your desk.

As he lopes toward his inner office:

Atop his desk is a package wrapped in newspaper. Eddie tears it open, revealing small bills bundled with rubber bands. As he counts the cash:

<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - TWO ORIENTAL WOMEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
are in the outer office. One is college-age, assimilated. The other is in her early 40s, with the aspect of an immigrant. A vinyl satchel is slung over her shoulder. The younger woman has come -- reluctantly, it seems -- to translate for the older.
</DIRECTION>
<TRANSLATOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Edward Dowd, please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRANSLATOR>
<DIRECTION>
Roger gets up from his desk. Hurries into the big room.
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm Roger Baron -- Mr. Dowd's associate. Can I help you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<DIRECTION>
The Immigrant anxiously peers past Roger. She knows he's not Edward Dowd.
</DIRECTION>
<TRANSLATOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mrs. Kim needs a lawyer. Her son stabbed a man to death.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRANSLATOR>
<DIRECTION>
In response Mrs. Kim -- who evidently understands English -- makes a passionate point, in a foreign tongue.
</DIRECTION>
<TRANSLATOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was self-defense. In prison.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRANSLATOR>
<DIRECTION>
This clarification elicits another burst from Mrs. Kim.
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER>
<DIRECTION>
(calls)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eddie...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<TRANSLATOR>
<DIRECTION>
(amends)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He didn't belong there in the first place. Eight years for a murder he didn't commit.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(adds)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm her neighbor's daughter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRANSLATOR>
<DIRECTION>
Without turning away:
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eddie...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<DIRECTION>
Finally Eddie comes striding in from his office. Waving away a cloud of pot smoke that's followed him out. He gives the women his patented reassuring smile.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm Eddie Dowd. What's up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Kim starts in again, rapid-fire. The Translator spews:
</DIRECTION>
<TRANSLATOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Her son didn't shoot anybody. He's the wrong guy. You meet him, you see he wouldn't stab a guy for fun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRANSLATOR>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He shot a man and stabbed a man?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Kim violently shakes her head as she chatters.
</DIRECTION>
<TRANSLATOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He didn't shoot anybody! Eight years in jail! The wrong guy! A good boy. From a fine home in Seoul, Korea. Shu Kai Kim.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRANSLATOR>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Kim finally quiets. The Translator takes a breath. And explains:
</DIRECTION>
<TRANSLATOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's his name. Shu Kai Kim.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRANSLATOR>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie nods, solemnly taking all this in. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll bet he's a wonderful boy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Roger watches Eddie, to see where he's going. Hides his disappointment when he hears:
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I can't help him. You see I have a specialty. Lawyers specialize, Mrs. Kim, and these days I do mostly...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
He doesn't bother explaining.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyway, I couldn't even go see your son without looking at the files on his case, first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
In response Mrs. Kim swings her satchel -- bulging with Shu's files -- into Eddie's arms. It's like taking a medicine ball to the chest. When he catches his breath:
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did you find me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<TRANSLATOR>
<DIRECTION>
(over Mrs. Kim)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She went to all the courthouses. She talked to pot smokers, pill sellers... They all speak of you, they all say the same thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRANSLATOR>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie can't help but puff up a little.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do they say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Kim answers in Korean. Translator hesitates. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<TRANSLATOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You do cases cheap.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRANSLATOR>
<DIRECTION>
Roger stifles a laugh. Eddie lowers Mrs. Kim's satchel to the floor and places a hand on her shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell you what. Mr. Baron and I will review your material and get back to you as soon as possible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Kim intently peers at Eddie to gauge his sincerity. He boldly meets her gaze as he steers her to the door.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you for stopping by.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Evidently convinced, Mrs. Kim makes a parting remark.
</DIRECTION>
<TRANSLATOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She thanks you in advance for saving her son.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRANSLATOR>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie flashes one last smile, then closes the door on the women. Roger shakes his head, bemused and moved.
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"She thanks you in advance for saving her son."
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<DIRECTION>
He picks up the vinyl satchel, starts pulling out papers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie feels compelled to poison the moment.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Talk about hard-sell, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
He snorts, incredulous, as he crosses the room.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Show me a guy who's not somebody's son.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Roger looks up at this remark. Then sets down the satchel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EDDIE'S INNER OFFICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie has re-lit his evening joint. As he settles back to enjoy it, there's Roger in the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Hit?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Rather than reach for the joint, Roger mops his brow.
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whew. That was close... We almost defended a guy who wasn't a dealer. Who knows, might even be innocent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie chuckles, defensive. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have a full caseload, Rog.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right, I forgot... We're pledged to protect every mid-level drug dealer in the Tri-state area.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(shivers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's an awesome responsibility.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't venerate drug dealers, Roger. To the contrary.

</ROGER>
<EDDIE>

</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Roger starts for the door. Stops. Turns.
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's just... I leave behind friends, family, a coupla good job offers in Chicago and in three dizzying weeks I've helped acquit a coke dealer, a speed dealer --

</ROGER>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I specialize, Roger...

<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So go take your job on Wall Street.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't tell me where to work. I moved to New York to work for Edward Dowd. But I can't believe that Edward Dowd has nothing better to do these days than invoke exalted legal issues to get off guilty little --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. You plan to be a criminal defense attorney, know this going in: Everybody's guilty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
This buys Roger's silence, for two beats. Then, sadly:
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wouldn't've said that ten years ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs his briefcase. Starts for the door. As he swings it open he HEARS:
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ten years is a long time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<ROGER>
<DIRECTION>
(stops, turns)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look -- I'm tired, I'll see you in the morning, Eddie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie watches him walk out. Drops the joint and vengefully grinds it out on the floor. To the closed door:
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Long time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Alone, now, he surveys his shabby domain and sighs, deeply. As he exhales, Eddie seems to be trying to blow away all the pot smoke that has clouded the room and shrouded his heart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he shambles across the office and through the door that leads to his living quarters. We TRACK with EDDIE past a kitchenette equipped with no labor-saving devices into:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Small, and beyond spartan. Single bed in one corner, plain wooden bureau opposite. The only color is provided by Eddie's festive trial ties, casually strewn. Eddie's bedroom is not unlike a cell we saw at the beginning of the movie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie stands at the window, trying to stare past the security bars into the New York night. But all he can see is his reflection.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:

ROGER is roused from sleep by a persistent KNOCKING. He stumbles out of bed, staggers to the door.

</ROGER>

Roger opens up. Eddie looks alarmingly revved.
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where?

INT. RIVIERA - MOVING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roger extracts the pertinent info from the newspaper clippings in Mrs. Kim's files.
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kim got busted at 19 for burglary. At 20 he was convicted in the shooting death of a young Chinese gang lord... The prosecution claimed Kim did it to get into "the Joe Boys"?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chinatown street gang.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kim denied it. But he admitted the gun was his, and he got life. Seems to have been an okay prisoner for eight years, til the... incident with Duane Lindeman.

</ROGER>
<EDDIE>

TWO CORRECTIONS OFFICERS lead the lawyers through a security checkpoint.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is large and bare but for a long wooden TABLE, four chairs. Leaden light leaks through one high, barred window. Eddie and Roger, on one side of the table, anxiously wait. Roger jumps at the CRUNCH of a deadbolt lock, turning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two hefty OFFICERS enter escorting SHU, in manacles. One pulls out the chair for Shu, the other sits him down. Eddie waits for them to back out of the room and re-lock the door.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm Eddie Dowd. I'm a lawyer. This here's Roger Baron -- also a lawyer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Shu's eyes, beady and suspicious, bore into Roger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roger wants to smile. But he can't. He stares down at his notebook.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now Shu peruses Eddie's long hair, peculiar suit.
</DIRECTION>
<SHU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My mother find you?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Racist asshole came at me.

	Exactly what happened then?

Roger is now furiously scribbling notes; we can almost hear him whimper.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The night that kid was shot to death in Chinatown, you were... where?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Shu doesn't answer. Eddie reaches into his jacket pocket, pulls out a pack of cigarettes. Offers one to Shu. Shu wordlessly plucks the cigarette from his fingers, careful to avoid any contact. Eddie lights it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now Roger wills himself to look up from his notebook.
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At the trial, you said you were at your apartment that night. Alone.

<SHU>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's eight years ago. Long time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHU>
<DIRECTION>
He studies his cigarette. No -- he's staring at the shackles on his wrists. Stares for one, two, three beats. Gravely:
</DIRECTION>
<SHU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Real long time.

Eddie's eyes flicker: He's heard that phrase, or one quite like it, somewhere before.

The lawyers head for Eddie's Riviera, in the visitor's lot.

Roger sighs. Shrugs.

Roger stares, baffled, as Eddie orates.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some gang punk gets wasted in front of the tourists. The mayor pressures the cops. The cops pressure the rival gang -- the Joe Boys. The Joes give up Shu Kai Kim -- the schmuck kid from Korea who's been pestering 'em to get in.

<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You really think that's what happened?

As they reach the Riviera, Eddie's in his all-the-world's-a- courtroom mode; i.e., he shouts, does semaphore.

Eddie shifts into gear. Pensive, now, as he steers out of the prison parking lot:

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roger follows Eddie to the fortified ENTRANCE of one of the warehouses. Eddie KNOCKS (in a pattern) on the reinforced steel door. Three sets of TUMBLERS TURN. The door opens.

Filling the doorframe is the imposing silhouette of a MAN in Nikes, chinos and windbreaker that must be standard issue for plainclothes cops. In a Darth Vader voice:

	Hey. The cops tell the eyewitnesses, "Don't doubt your ID, we got 'em dead on the gun." Meantime they tell their ballistics expert, "Hey, it's cool -- three people saw the guy fire the gun." It's a game, man. And you know what?

As Eddie continues, Roger queasily flips through a stack of forensic exhibits. We SEE x-ray positives of Jimmy Chin's skull, prints of microscopic autopsy slides...

Eddie turns.

Eddie boards. Slow enough that the Reporter has time to follow him in. The door closes.

ON SHERIDAN SQUARE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie crosses Seventh Avenue. Pulls out his keys, to let himself into his building. OS, hears:
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Eddie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
A MAN stands, silhouetted, at the top of the subway stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Spare a quarter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<DIRECTION>
EDDIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
reaches back into his pocket. And gets RAKED across the jaw with a short length of PIPE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS ASSAILANT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is a muscular PUNK in a black sleeveless t-shirt. Two black teardrops tattooed on his cheek. In a WHISPER:

<PUNK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Race traitor. Gook lover.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUNK>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SUBWAY STAIRS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Punk flings a stunned Eddie halfway down the stairs, to continue the beating out of plain sight. On the landing, the men bob back and forth, drunken dance partners --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and then Eddie manages to grab the Punk's face, squeezing it with his ebbing strength, SMUDGING the TEARDROPS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EDDIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
puzzles, for an instant, at the smeared "tattoos".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE PUNK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
senses something's awry. In his eyes, a flicker of panic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then the Punk's eyes go cold again as he smashes Eddie's head against the tile. As Eddie collapses:
</DIRECTION>
<PUNK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Enemy of the Aryan People.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUNK>
<DIRECTION>
Punctuated with a kick of his combat boots. Eddie curls up to protect himself.
</DIRECTION>
<PUNK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Commie. Faggot. Motherfucker. Jew.

</PUNK>
<EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
(gasps)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Only half.

For this, Eddie gets another kick. Then the ultimatum, told as a "Confucious say" joke:
</DIRECTION>
<PUNK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aryan Warriors say: If the Chink goes to trial, you die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUNK>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie groans, his eyes roll back. FADE to BLACK. While the SCREEN stays BLACK, we HEAR:
</DIRECTION>
<DETECTIVE_1_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In my humble opinion, Mr. Dowd, you opened a Pandora's box of ugly shit.

INT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT - LATER

EDDIE, in the Detective Bullpen -- ice pack pressed to his bruised jaw -- leafs through a mugbook. ROGER, beside him, addresses a DETECTIVE, across the desk.

<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Eddie deserved this. I guess rape victims want to get laid at gunpoint.

But Eddie could care less. Indicating the mugbook:

	These are all the known Aryan Warriors in New York?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE BOOK
</DIRECTION>

Mugshots and descriptions, four to a page. Several subjects sport the teardrop tattoos.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie's HANDS enter FRAME. His fingertips still smudged with black ink, from Roeder's cheeks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie studies the photo, his fingertips. Abruptly shuts the mugbook.

As they emerge, Roger grips Eddie's upper arm, to steady him. Quietly:

	His name is Chuckie Roeder. But something's very weird.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- You found his mugshot?

</ROGER>

Eddie KNOCKS on a door. Roger waits with trepidation. The door is answered by:

A BOY

Towheaded, in pajamas. No more than eight years old.

INT. ARYAN WARRIOR HOUSE

<DIRECTION>
The little boy GIGGLES, then leads Eddie and Roger through a nightmare LIVING ROOM strewn with pizza cartons, shotgun shells and dogshit. A MAC-10 submachine gun is propped in a corner. In another corner, an old b&w TV. Flickering across the screen: a rerun of "Love, American Style." TWO ARYAN WARRIORS were slumped in front of it, swigging generic beer while ogling the '60s bikini queens. Now they sit up straight and reach for the guns as the lawyers pass, into:

INT. BEDROOM

<DIRECTION>
The D.A.'s office is on the south side of the building.
</DIRECTION>
<RECEPTIONIST>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is Mr. Reynard expecting you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RECEPTIONIST>
<DIRECTION>
INT. REYNARD'S RECEPTION AREA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reynard's Receptionist is politely but terminally skeptical.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This'll only take a minute.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<RECEPTIONIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry but Mr. Reynard is running about an hour behind schedule.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RECEPTIONIST>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then just leave word: Mr. Dowd and Mr. Kim plan to proceed with trial.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grand, marbled. Eddie's footfalls ECHO as he lopes to the stairs. And now he hears a deep, sepulchral:
</DIRECTION>
<MAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Ed?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - ROBERT REYNARD stands at the far end of the corridor, shirt-sleeves rolled up, arms akimbo.
</DIRECTION>
<REYNARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did my girl hear your message correctly?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNARD>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie ambles toward Reynard.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess so, or you wouldn't be standing there, am I right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
The D.A. shakes his head, disappointed in himself.
</DIRECTION>
<REYNARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why did I think I could deal reasonably with a man who defends coke pushers for free?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNARD>
<DIRECTION>
The lawyers face off, salvos reverberating.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Coke pushers pay cash. That subsidizes the pot possession cases.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
D.A.s slip past, careful to stay out of the line of fire.
</DIRECTION>
<REYNARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But now you've strayed from your area of expertise -- dope -- into street assassins. A subject on which you're dangerously ignorant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNARD>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I'm a quick study. Tell your Deputy D.A. -- Rabin? -- that I'll see him in court.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<REYNARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Mr. Dowd, you'll see me in court. I'm prosecuting this case.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNARD>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie takes a beat to absorb the news. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why am I surprised? It's consistent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Reynard nods in solemn accord.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You seem to have a talent for putting non-whites behind bars...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
A frost settles on the District Attorney's face.
</DIRECTION>
<REYNARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll prosecute anyone who fucks up. If that makes me look racist, it's a trade-off I'll live with, Ed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNARD>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's big of you, Bob.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
He gives Reynard a farewell-for-now salute.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll see vou in court.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
He does a little pirouette. Reynard's words, swelling out, follow him as he dances down the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<REYNARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll beat you, Ed. You can hide behind the whole Bill of Rights...
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNARD>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie hurriedly descends the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WEST VILLAGE - THAT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As we PAN the quaint townhouses and tenements we HEAR, OVER:
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You guys shoulda been there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
FIND a WINDOW in which THREE SILHOUETTES are seen. In the context of the cityscape, there's a poignant -- even fearful -- sense of their smallness and isolation.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The fuckin' D.A. himself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OUTER OFFICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie paces, gesticulates.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dude was quaking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Finally Roger feels compelled to deliver bad news.
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, Eddie? The, um, ballistics guy, George...? He called, and...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(uneasily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His tests show that Shu's gun fired the bullet that killed Jimmy Chin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	George is a fucking burnout case. I didn't want him on the stand anyway. Get more names from Billy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie turns to Kitty.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you find me an expert witness on the Joe Boys?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Kitty is nearly as reluctant as Roger.
</DIRECTION>
<KITTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The best expert in New York is a Soc professor at Columbia...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(carefully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Apparently doing a hit was the way to get into the Joe Boys.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KITTY>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie levels a "So what are you telling me?" look at Kitty.
</DIRECTION>
<KITTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So there goes your theory about the Joes giving up Shu to protect their trigger man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KITTY>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I like that theory. And since I'm not putting Twerp Professor on the stand, and since I don't have a better theory, I'm sticking with that theory. Meantime I want pictures of the Joes. What'll you bet there was a guy in the gang looked enough like Shu to fool the eyewitnesses!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Kitty and Roger halfheartedly nod. Eddie tries a pep-talk.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our guy is innocent. We prod in enough places, I don't care how solid this case against Shu looks -- there's a weak spot somewhere and when we hit it the whole hideous thing collapses. Better yet, we get our hands on Chuckie Roeder, we don't have to grope in the dark. Chuckie is the answer man!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Kitty snakes her head.
</DIRECTION>
<KITTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've phoned every art supply retailer and wholesaler in the Tri-state area. No one's heard of Chuckie Roeder.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KITTY>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you considered that Chuckie Roeder's not calling himself Chuckie Roeder these days? Get his mugshot from one of the many law officers who've got hotpants for you... then canvass those art supplies places. We're gonna win this one, Kitty, but ya gotta believe...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
ROGER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Uneasy with Eddie's optimism, he stands, wanders back toward the bathroom. Then notices that the door leading to Eddie's living quarters is slightly a jar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roger sees a single bed in one corner, plain wooden bureau opposite. But on the walls, something strange and beckoning. As Eddie exhorts in b.g., Roger slips into:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EDDIE'S BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hung on a hundred hooks and nails are as many TIES. The wide, thrift-shop kind that Eddie wears to court. From a distance we can't distinguish the prints; the room is lit only by a blinking neon across the street. As Roger sifts through the ties, we go in CLOSE on the big amoebas, the zaftig mermaids, the oddball, dated patterns and paintings. It's as though each tie stands for a case won or lost, but fought. As though each loud, shameless tie is a piece of Eddie himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now, as he pulls the ties from their hooks to examine them, Roger exposes old PHOTOS tacked to the wall and forgotten.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE PHOTOS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
are mostly yellow, cracked, faded. Here is EDDIE twenty-five years ago, hair cropped, a Princeton undergrad. Five years later he's sprouted a beard and is posed with his graduating class at Yale Law School.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now it's the glory days of the mid-sixties and Eddie's in his prime, a longhaired defense attorney in denim and leather... At a press conference, flanked by Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin. In Washington Square Park, igniting an anti- war rally.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At a Sheep Meadow Be-in, arm around a lovely young woman, toddler balanced on his shoulders, infant cradled in her lap. Eddie's family on a long-ago spring day.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And here is Eddie, about 30, in a swarm of student activists outside a Federal courthouse, clearly after winning an acquittal, held high above the crowd like a conquering hero. Now we BRING UP an excited BUZZ of VOICES -- as though the crowd, in the photo, were somehow coming to life. OVER:
</DIRECTION>
<JUDGE_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Matter of People vs. Shu Kai Kim.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SUPERIOR COURT - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We've hit the big time; it's clean, spacious, echoic. The previous courtrooms were, by comparison, mere vestibules.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JUDGE QUEALY BANGS his GAVEL.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This case has been tried before, but you the jurors must make no...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<DIRECTION>
Now the Judge notices something amiss. He squints --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE DEFENSE TABLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's SHU. With his new bristly growth of head-hair and oversized suit, he appears thin and mild-mannered, almost bookish. At Shu's left sits ROGER, looking around, bemused. The chair at Shu's right is empty.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Where is Mr. Dowd?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MEN'S ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie is alone in here, at the sink. He's just doused his face. He examines his reflection in the dirty mirror, trying hard to like what he sees. HOLD for several silent BEATS as Eddie gathers his strength and courage. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<REYNARD>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You will hear from the detectives who arrested Shu Kai Kim and found the murder weapon in his apartment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNARD>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COURTROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie has now taken his seat beside Shu. Reynard is in the midst of his opening statement.
</DIRECTION>
<REYNARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	An eyewitness will testify that she saw Mr. Kim shoot Jimmy Chin in cold blood. An expert who examined Kim's gun, and the bullet that tore through Jimmy Chin's brain, will testify that Shu Kai Kim was the killer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNARD>
<DIRECTION>
He strides over to the jury box.
</DIRECTION>
<REYNARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But this trial is about much more than Mr. Kim's guilt. It's a test of our legal system -- the fairest, most liberal in the world, in world history... So fair and liberal that lawyers like Mr. Dowd can manipulate it on a whim to re-try convicted killers. Well that's a trade-off we can live with, provided we have the courage to meet our civic obligations. You twelve are all that stand between society and every Shu Kai Kim itching to get free. Quite a responsibility. But one I know that each of you can handle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNARD>
<DIRECTION>
TIME CUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EDDIE paces off a large circle -- a territorial act in which he is claiming the courtroom as his.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Picture this. In a part of town that thrives on its spirit of celebration... good food, friendly faces... one young man walked up to another, out on the street, in front of the tourists, and committed murder.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
As Eddie pivots, we see that his hair is pulled back with a bright blue ribbon. The Jurors see this, too. If he didn't have it before, Eddie's now got their full attention.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wonder if Chinatown's shopkeepers and restaurant owners pleaded with the Mayor... I wonder if the Mayor put pressure on the Police Commissioner...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie jigs over to the jury box.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you think the Mayor said to the Police Commissioner? I think the Mayor said, "Arrest somebody...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
He's trailed off; the last word is whispered. As he opens his mouth again --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- TWELVE JURORS crane forward to hear.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...ANYBODY!"
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
An older woman GASPS. The others merely flinch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIME CUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The homicide detectives lead off. First up is MONTELL. Early 40s, beefy, black, with a tough-but-fair persona.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reynard concluding his direct.
</DIRECTION>
<REYNARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And so, having brought Mr. Kim in for booking, you arranged a line-up with six other Asian males.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNARD>
<MONTELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONTELL>
<REYNARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the results of the line-up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNARD>
<MONTELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All the eyewitnesses picked Kim.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONTELL>
<DIRECTION>
TIME CUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie smiles broadly at Montell, who smiles back. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Isn't it a fact that the "six other Asian men" in the line-up were all of the classic Mongoloid type, whereas Shu has the distinct facial bone structure of a Korean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<REYNARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Objection. The witness is not an expert in racial classification.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNARD>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Isn't it a standard trick to pack a line-up with men who resemble each other but look different than the suspect, so the suspect will stand out for the eyewitnesses?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<REYNARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Argumentative.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNARD>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sustained.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie takes a beat, flashes another smile. Montell reciprocates. Now Eddie shifts into his empathetic mode.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You had to use less than scrupulous methods, true? The Mayor was pushing you hard for an arrest, wasn't he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Montell sadly shakes his head. As empathetic as Eddie:
</DIRECTION>
<MONTELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want to disappoint you. But the Mayor and I have never spoken.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONTELL>
<DIRECTION>
A few TITTERS in the GALLERY.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was being metaphorical, Detective Montell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<MONTELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that a fancy way of being wrong?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONTELL>
<DIRECTION>
The half-dozen REPORTERS can barely suppress their snickers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COURTROOM - NEXT DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Next up is SKLAROFF, a coiled, rangy cop in his late 30s.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exactly what information led you to arrest my client just two-and-a-half hours after the shooting took place?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<SKLAROFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We had a description of the suspect.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKLAROFF>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A "description"? What, Asian male 18 to 30, black hair, brown eyes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
From the prosecution table --
</DIRECTION>
<REYNARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Badgering.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNARD>
<SKLAROFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We had intelligence.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKLAROFF>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You had intelligence...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Phrased to sound as likely as peace in Beirut. Sklaroff struggles to contain his resentment. Carefully:
</DIRECTION>
<SKLAROFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We had information bearing on Mr. Kim's desire to gain admission into the Joe Boys by assassinating a member of a rival gang.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKLAROFF>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't this "information" come from the Joe Boys themselves -- did they not all but hand you Shu Kai Kim, a Korean, an outsider?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<REYNARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Objection! Your Honor, this isn't cross-examination, it's Mr. Dowd's opening argument again -- and again, it's pure fabrication.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNARD>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sustained.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie essays another line of attack.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Isn't it unusual for a man who's just committed a murder in plain sight to bring the weapon back to his apartment?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<REYNARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Calls for speculation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNARD>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sustained.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<DIRECTION>
But Sklaroff has weathered enough abuse. Indignantly:
</DIRECTION>
<SKLAROFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're implying that I planted a gun?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKLAROFF>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not at all --
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<SKLAROFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kim's prints were all over it -- He admitted it was his gun, f'r godsake!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKLAROFF>
<EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
(hastily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your Honor, the witness' response was non-responsive... I ask you to strike it from the record...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
As Judge Quealy does just that, OS, Eddie backs away from the excitable detective.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No more questions.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
As he drifts back to the defense table, Reynard stands.
</DIRECTION>
<REYNARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The People call retired Detective Vincent Badalato.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNARD>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie sits. Wearing a confident grin for the benefit of any jurors who may be watching. Only Roger and Shu can HEAR:
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I'm dying out there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<SHU>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly reassures)

	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay, Eddie.

The Bailiff escorts the last homicide detective into court.

	You've got another shot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - DETECTIVE BADALATO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
enters. In a wheelchair, pushed by his sister CONNIE. He's overweight and droopy-eyed, probably on pain pills. She's got the gait, physique and complexion of a spinster alcoholic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - THE DEFENSE TABLE
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A fucking wheelchair?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<ROGER>
<DIRECTION>
(explains)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A spinal injury, in the line of duty. It was in Kitty's report...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<DIRECTION>
TIME CUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reynard concluding his direct. Mellifluous and caring, a pediatrician to a kid with mumps.
</DIRECTION>
<REYNARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you left the murder scene...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNARD>
<DIRECTION>
Badalato clutches his original report. His eyes rake the page, find the relevant section. He adjusts his glasses. His voice is a whisper thickened by painkillers.
</DIRECTION>
<BADALATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At, un, ten-thirty, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BADALATO>
<REYNARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And then what did you do, Officer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNARD>
<DIRECTION>
As Badalato replies we FLASH BACK TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CHINATOWN STREET - NIGHT, NOVEMBER 2, 1980
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The scene has been secured, photos and statements taken. Police tape holds back GAWKERS. Jimmy Chin's shrouded BODY is loaded, on a stretcher, into the rear of the paddywagon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FIND BADALATO -- young, fit -- at the driver's side door of the paddywagon, discreetly conferring with the DRIVER. Now the DRIVER steps out, and Badalato climbs in, in his place. As he pulls the paddywagon away we HEAR, OVER:
</DIRECTION>
<BADALATO>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I proceeded with Decedent's body to the office of the County Coroner.

INT. COURTROOM - EDDIE

questions the disabled detective, careful to be cordial.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Detective Badalato. You reached the County Coroner's and signed over the body, when?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Badalato finds the relevant section of the report. Focuses. Fusses with the pages. Starts to answer -- then succumbs to a terrible coughing fit. COMPASSIONATE MURMURS from the JURY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Bailiff hurries over, gently pats Badalato's back, pours him a cup of water. Badalato downs it with effort. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<BADALATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Eleven-thirty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BADALATO>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie opens his mouth, to continue his cross. But now his eyes dart to the jury box, and what comes out is:

	<DIALOGUE>
	No more questions, your Honor.

Eddie hurries past Reynard, in the rotunda, surrounded by REPORTERS. Looking well pleased with himself, the D.A. is engaged in a spontaneous, genial Q & A.

Roger and Kitty catch up with Eddie, making for the exit.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A fucking wheelchair?

	I didn't put him in a wheelchair. Reynard did. He can get around without one -- it's all in my report.

<EDDIE>

Eddie tries not to look overly impressed.

Kitty pulls a BAG from her pocketbook.

Light manufacturing and loft-dwelling refugees from SoHo, separated from Manhattan by the East River. TIGHTEN ON:

<ART_S_SUPPLIES>
<DIRECTION>
as Eddie and Roger enter the warehouse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roger notes the PLAQUES that line the walls, from the Chamber of Commerce, Urban League, etc., naming Arturo Esparza "Equal Opportunity Employer of the Year". At the front desks are three tough-looking SECRETARIES.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is "Art" around?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
SECRETARY 1 squints at this bizarre interloper.
</DIRECTION>
<SECRETARY_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He expecting you-all?

	No, but this won't take long.

ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A coffee-colored YOUNG WOMAN gets up from her desk in the far corner. She hurries over to rescue the Receptionist.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm Mariquilla Esparza -- Art's wife.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie is abashed at her fine, radiant features. Roger tries not to stare.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Mariquilla"? It's a lovely name.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Marquilla turns her face, to hide her blush.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_ESPARZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Mister...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ESPARZA>
<DIRECTION>
And then a compact, powerful-looking LATINO (bald, bearded, bespectacled) charges INTO FRAME.
</DIRECTION>
<LATINO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Art Esparza. How can I help you?

He nods at Mariquilla -- she makes herself scarce.

They wander past Esparza, and into:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE WAREHOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A multi-tiered space crowded with sinks, toilets, tubs... Black, white and brown MEN load skids, ride forklifts.
</DIRECTION>
<ESPARZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't come back here... Anything happens to you I'm liable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESPARZA>
<EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
(pleasantly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a lawyer. The firm is thinking about renovating. Everything dates back to the Sixties.

	Do you see a toilet here you think is really me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Roger joins in the snowing of Esparza.
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're considering one of those high tech designs, what do you call it, a "lowboy"?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<ESPARZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me but we're not a store and we're not a showroom...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESPARZA>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie has slipped away. Hoping to distract Esparza:
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't I read it's healthier? To sit lower on a toilet? Y'know, with your knees up, and --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<DIRECTION>
Esparza is suddenly -- angrily -- aware he's been had. Sharply:
</DIRECTION>
<ESPARZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Where's your friend?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESPARZA>
<DIRECTION>
ON EDDIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Striding down a long AISLE bounded by tall walls of piping. He ducks around a SKID stacked with industrial sinks... Runs into a waist-high CONVEYOR BELT loaded with large cartons. Starts to back away -- then sees, below the conveyor belt --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAIR OF BOOTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The combat boots that he last saw aimed at his eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EDDIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Freezes, for a beat -- then takes off down the length of the conveyor belt... But the belt goes on and on, and so Eddie drops down and scuttles under it. As he gets to the other side and leaps up, he sees --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHUCKIE ROEDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Who sees Eddie, lets out a startled cry and drops the carton he was checking, then spins on his heels and sprints away...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EDDIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
gives chase, slipping on the contents of the spilled carton... scores of loose spigots... Then he finds his footing, and races after Roeder down another:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AISLE OF PIPES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This one about thirty yards long. Now from the other end, moving quite fast, comes a FORKLIFT. Roeder dives out of its way, climbing up the wall of pipes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie clambers after him as the forklift DRIVER frantically downshifts -- and the point of a prong catches Eddie's pantleg, tearing it, as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROEDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
scurries over the now-collapsing wall of pipe, onto a double skid of horizontally stacked HOT WATER HEATERS...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie stumbles after him... Both men struggling to stay balanced... Now, just as Eddie is about to seize him, Roeder reaches a steep ladder -- he breathlessly climbs up to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CATWALK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie claws his way up the ladder, right behind... He takes a flying leap at Roeder, grabbing hold of his belt...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But the catwalk sways, sickeningly, and Roeder kicks free, nearly sending Eddie over the side. Now Roeder bolts to the far end of the catwalk, fairly flying down the ladder there...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meantime, Eddie takes a breath and drops off the catwalk... twenty feet down, and just an arm's length from Roeder. But as he thrusts out his hand, a HUGE MAN intercedes, hurling Eddie to the concrete.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROEDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
dashes across a sea of TUBS, his boots CRACKING several... Then OUT a BACK DOOR, disappearing into the night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie -- winded and disoriented -- is yanked to his feet by a flushed Art Esparza.
</DIRECTION>
<ESPARZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You fool.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESPARZA>
<DIRECTION>
Muscular EMPLOYEES, brandishing pipe-wrenches, etc., have formed a menacing ring around Eddie.
</DIRECTION>
<ESPARZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everything's cool! Back off... take five!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESPARZA>
<DIRECTION>
He starts briskly walking Eddie back to the front office.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I'm a lawyer and --
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<ESPARZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- I don't care who you are. You could've been killed. Every man and woman in here has done hard prison time. And we look out for each other.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESPARZA>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"We"?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<ESPARZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I did five years in Attica. Lot of cons helped me in the joint. But I never got help from any lawyer... I built this business for guys like me who couldn't get a break anywhere else. "Art's Supplies" is for ex- cons. Not lawyers.

Esparza is pained to hear it.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Chuckie... Never learn...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESPARZA>

Then remembers he's with civilians. Collects himself.

	Dowd. Eddie Dowd.

</EDDIE>
<ESPARZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you'd had the sense to ask for my help, I might've helped you. But you've probably scared Chuckie Roeder off for good, I have a whole bunch of jumpy employees to handle and you're both going to be on your way. Now.

EXT. RIVINGTON STREET - EARLY EVENING

<DIRECTION>
Eddie parks at a hydrant, the lawyers hop out. Eddie goes to the trunk, forces it open, finds what he was looking for. Tucks the tire iron into his pants.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roger was already checking the addresses on this stretch of lower East Side transient hotels and pawn shops.

Pleasant, middle-class decor. We haven't been here before. We HEAR a persistent KNOCKING.

KITTY crosses to the door, squints through the peephole and sighs. Then opens the door. ENTER:
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Find him?

</EDDIE>
<KITTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eddie, these things take time. Particularly at this hour...

ON THE MUGBOOK

Like the one the cops showed Eddie. But instead of sneering tattooed whites, here are sneering tattooed Asians.

Eddie looks up from the book.

<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
THE MUGSHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An ornery-looking Shu Kai Kim wearing a greasy shag haircut. A far cry from Mrs. Kim's "Small, Small World" photo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boy, I was right about the distinctive facial bone structure of a Korean. I thought I was bullshitting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
He's all over the room, waving Shu's photo, fulminating:
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The odd man out always takes the fall! Haven't I been saying all along that --
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly aware that Kitty's watching him play Edward C. Dowd, Legendary Hell-For-Leather-Lawyer, he falters, embarrassed. But Kitty's expression is affectionate, approving -- this is just the spirit that drew her to Eddie years ago.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sensing this, Eddie relaxes. His voice softens.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I haven't thanked you for your work, Kitty. You're doing good work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<KITTY>

A beat passes between them that's both intimate and awkward.

<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Got any booze in the house?

<KITTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't drink "booze".

	<DIALOGUE>
	You do.

Eddie gently places his big hands on Kitty's slim shoulders.
</DIRECTION>
<KITTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eddie this is silly... are we supposed to pretend nothing's happened in the last ten years and --
	</DIALOGUE>
</KITTY>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing has. But that's all changing.
	</DIALOGUE>

Touched by Eddie's optimism, Kitty kisses him. It's meant to be quick and light but he embraces her and the kiss continues.

INT. LOBBY

The ancient NIGHT CLERK is asleep, his head resting on the Front Desk. Gimlet-eyed, Eddie peers at the NAMES taped to the mailboxes behind him.

UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Musty, narrow, dimly lit. Muffled, debauched LAUGHTER... Eddie squints at one door, then another, then: Room 2D.

He takes a breath, pulls out the tire iron, KNOCKS with it. No answer. Eddie tries the door. It's unlocked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHUCKIE ROEDER sits quietly at a plain wooden desk in the darkened, unadorned room. Scattered across the floor are well-thumbed copies of Guns & Ammo and Blueboy.

CLOSER - ROEDER

Waxy and still -- like a Duane Hanson sculpture. Right hand suspended over the left forearm.

<DIRECTION>
EDDIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
sharply inhales as he ventures closer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SYRINGE in Roeder's right hand, needle jammed in a vein. The left arm is dotted with track marks.

Eddie slowly backs away from the upright corpse. Gripped not by horror, but the strangest sort of pity.
</DIRECTION>

CUT TO:

<DIRECTION>
INT. MORGUE - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chuckie Roeder is laid out in a locker drawer. On one side stands a MORGUE TECH; on the other, Detective 1 (from the police headquarters scene).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roger is off in a corner, giving a statement to Detective 2.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie stands nearby, moodily contemplating the demise of his last, best hope. OS, he HEARS:
</DIRECTION>
<MAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- I guess you found him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
ART ESPARZA has entered. His face is flushed with emotion.
</DIRECTION>
<ESPARZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He had no family. I have to I.D. him. I'm his family.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESPARZA>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie nods, not sure what to say. Esparza grimly regards Roeder's corpse, then nods at Detective 1. A tear slides down his cheek as the MORGUE TECH slams shut the drawer. Esparza turns to Eddie. His voice thick:
</DIRECTION>
<ESPARZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You won't be able to use him now, will you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESPARZA>
<DIRECTION>
Roger wraps an arm around Eddie's shoulder.

<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, Eddie, let's go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<ESPARZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- That's goddam tragic, isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESPARZA>
<DIRECTION>
He starts for Eddie, who doesn't speak or even move to defend himself. Detective 1 grabs Esparza in time, holds him back.
</DIRECTION>
<DETECTIVE_1>

	C'mon, get outta here, Dowd.

EXT. MORGUE - MORNING

Eddie and Roger exit with Detective 2. They're in the City Hall district, not far from the Criminal Courts Building.

<DIRECTION>
As the Detective crosses, returning to Police Headquarters, adjacent:
</DIRECTION>
<DETECTIVE_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're in over your head, Dowd... Don't you defend pot smokers?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_2>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie ignores. He and Roger keep walking, the other way.
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what're we gonna do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...What do you mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I mean, Roeder's gone, now... A dead end. Believe me, I'm sorry too, but...

	<DIALOGUE>
	But what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<ROGER>
<DIRECTION>
(breaks the news)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've heard from the last ballistics expert on the list. It's an even ten who say Shu's gun killed Jimmy Chin!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's why I hate experts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eddie... it's one thing to compare Clyde Gruner to Jesus Christ. It's even okay to claim that Shu Kai Kim is just slightly holier than the Pope... as long as you don't really believe it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey -- you believe what you want. Shu Kai Kim is innocent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Eddie...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know how I know? 'Cause Reynard says he's guilty, and Reynard's full of shit! Look --
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Intoxicated by his illogic, Eddie yanks out his battered wallet. Tugs out one of his two photos of Shu -- the "Small, Small World" snapshot from Mrs. Kim.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not the face of a killer!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
He hands it to Roger, who hands it right back.
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're carrying that around like it was a picture of your girlfriend!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(blurts)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want to see your heart broken when this case crashes and burns!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
(grim resolve)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not gonna happen. I'm gonna create reasonable doubt. Buckle your seatbelt and watch me work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie steps into the street, into traffic. Cars wildly swerve around him, drivers HONKING in outrage. Roger looks both ways, dashes out. Catching up:
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But Roeder's dead. Ballistics says it's Shu! We don't have one witness -- unless we put Cecil Stipe on the stand...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not that desperate.
	</DIALOGUE>

Indicating with a gesture that they're only blocks from Chinatown. Puzzled, Roger peers back the way they came.
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's weird -- I pictured the morgue being way across town.

After two beats he turns around to find Eddie gone.

INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - LATE MORNING

Empty but for a banquet table Eddie shares with SIX PILLARS (ranging in age from 30 to 80) of the Asian community. The table is laden with delectable dim sum dishes. Eddie is the only one not eating -- he's too busy sucking up to his hosts.

	We need you in court. The jury'll be swayed by your support. You men are the backbone -- the conscience -- of your community!

The Pillars are unmoved. Eddie lightens up.

This gets the table's full attention.

<EDDIE>

	But I'm not here to point the finger. I did dumb things when I was 19 too -- we all did. Wrong time, wrong place, everybody here could've made a perfect fall guy instead of our lives turning out how they did. This case is about all of us. And you're gonna feel like a bunch of goats when the truth comes out.

Clearly, one wouldn't try to bully such a venerable bunch unless one were desperate, unhinged, or a bit of both.

Reynard concludes his direct examination of the Police Gang Expert, a florid, 50ish Irish Detective.

<BALLISTICS_EXPERT>

Eddie's pointer finds another mark on the rear of the right bullet. Or maybe it's the shadow cast by the pointer.

We watch the Killer's back as he races to an intersection where several PEDESTRIANS wait for the Walk signal. We glimpse his face again as he pulls a gun... The YOUNG MAN in front of him whirls, there's a sharp CRACK and then the YOUNG MAN is lying in the street, blood welling around his head.

The Killer takes off running.

ROGER behind Eddie. He moves to catch up, but sees that Eddie is moving toward Kitty, waiting at the exit door. So Roger hangs back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But without even slowing down or giving a sign, Eddie moves right past Kitty, and out of the building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shocked, Roger goes to Kitty. Gently touches her arm.
</DIRECTION>
<KITTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay. It was always like that.

</KITTY>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shouldn't one of us...?

</ROGER>
<KITTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No -- leave him be. It's better for everyone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KITTY>
<DIRECTION>
Roger nods, resigned -- and then someone else in the departing CROWD catches his eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A WOMAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Furtive and alone, hurrying away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCENE
</DIRECTION>

Roger turns to Kitty, an odd look on his face.

Kitty shrugs: sure.

INT. PRISON VISITORS ROOM - EVENING - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lawyer and his client face each other through a pane of bulletproof plastic. Each has a telephone in front of him; both fretfully finger their receivers. Eddie picks up first.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quite a bit you didn't tell me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<SHU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When I joined up I took an oath of secrecy. I told you what you needed to know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHU>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie's words hiss, like steam escaping.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't need to know that a man I'm defending on a gang-murder rap is a prison soldier who kills over drugs?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<SHU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was self-defense.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHU>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jimmy Chin? Was that self-defense too?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
In response Shu hangs up. Eddie POUNDS on the plastic, to get him to pick up again. Shu does, provisionally.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, it's just -- You'll laugh but there was awhile when I thought, Hey, we're two sorry assholes who need each other. Who can help each other.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
As though he couldn't possibly have heard this right:
</DIRECTION>
<SHU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- How could I help you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHU>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By trusting me. Shit, man...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
He trails off, momentarily defeated by the magnitude of what's been lost. Now:
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got my face kicked 'cause I trusted you. I couldn't find an expert to say it wasn't your gun killed Jimmy Chin but it didn't matter... I went up against the goddam D.A. himself but I didn't care because I trusted you, because I believed in you, because I thought there was a bond between us!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Like a spurned lover who can't let go, Eddie implores Shu, through the plastic:
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't you feel that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Shu looks at Eddie is though he were an alien life form.
</DIRECTION>
<SHU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're out there and I'm in here. My bond -- my trust -- is with the dudes in here that watch my ass. I took an oath of loyalty to them. You're out there. Who are you to me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHU>
<DIRECTION>
As he continues, a simmering resentment heats up his words.
</DIRECTION>
<SHU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When you leave this place you're going out to dinner or a movie or get laid. Where's our bond? I'm going back to my cell and wait to die. So tell me: Where's our bond?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHU>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For awhile we had this dream we were innocent. That was our bond... but then we woke up. And now I'd like to hear everything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Shu's eyes narrow.
</DIRECTION>
<SHU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean, "everything"?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHU>
<DIRECTION>
With exaggerated calm, to cover the rage:
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me about Chinatown, Shu. Tell me the tr--
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>

Shu hangs up. Rocks to his shackled feet. And shuffles out of the room, to return to his cell.

EXT. ART'S SUPPLIES - EVENING - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the gated window, a WOMAN and MAN -- surely Art and Mariquilla Esparza -- are seen in silhouette. Business hours are over; the couple is alone in the front office. Mariquilla sits at her desk, Art paces the office. Now, as he passes her chair, Art leans down and kisses the top of his wife's head. She involuntarily stiffens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Art takes umbrage. MUFFLED WORDS. Mariquilla rises, grabs her raincoat. Art touches her shoulder, entreating. Mariquilla shakes her head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - ROGER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watching this shadow play from the opposite curb. In b.g., the shimmering lights of the 59th Street Bridge and Manhattan's skyscrapers seem worlds away from this misery.

BACK TO "ART'S SUPPLIES"

As Mariquilla exits the building.

EXT. STREET - EVENING - WITH MARIQUILLA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she hurries along, lost in her thoughts. Now Roger falls into step beside her.
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Mrs. Esparza?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<DIRECTION>
She startles slightly, then quickly recovers her composure.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_ESPARZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you want?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ESPARZA>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm Roger Baron. I work with Edward Dowd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<DIRECTION>
Mariquilla gives no sign that this means anything to her.
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What were you... Why were you at Shu's trial this afternoon?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<MRS_ESPARZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- What trial?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ESPARZA>
<DIRECTION>
Her pace quickens.
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I followed you here from court.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<MRS_ESPARZA>
<DIRECTION>
(flustered)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I knew Jimmy Chin. The boy who was shot. Okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ESPARZA>
<ROGER>
<DIRECTION>
(trying to make sense)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...And you were at the trial to... to see that justice was done?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<MRS_ESPARZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ESPARZA>
<DIRECTION>
She briskly rounds a corner. Roger stays on her.
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then it was your idea to have Chuckie Roeder scare Eddie off the case?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<MRS_ESPARZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Why don't you ask Chuckie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ESPARZA>
<ROGER>
<DIRECTION>
(reminds her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chuckie OD'd, Mrs. Esparza. He's dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<DIRECTION>
Mariquilla seems to flinch.
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Art didn't tell you...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<DIRECTION>
Mariquilla abruptly stops and turns to him. Imploring.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_ESPARZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look. Mister --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ESPARZA>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Roger --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<MRS_ESPARZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mustn't talk to Art. You mustn't tell Art that I was at the trial. Do you hear me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ESPARZA>
<DIRECTION>
There is animal fear behind Mariquilla's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you lost a friend... You've got a right to...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<DIRECTION>
A realization forms.
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait... Were you and Jimmy Chin...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<DIRECTION>
Mariquilla gazes into Roger's open, questing eyes. They're the same age, but one has lived much longer than the other.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_ESPARZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't talk to you anymore. Go away, please... Never come back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ESPARZA>
<DIRECTION>
With that, she crosses the street. Slipping into darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROGER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
watches her disappear. And then, after two beats, he resumes walking, back the way he came, toward the subway station.
</DIRECTION>

REVEAL

A figure, lurking in the shadows, lights a cigarette. As the match flares we make out the face of ART ESPARZA.

INT. HALLWAY - LATE NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
A glassy-eyed Eddie KNOCKS and KNOCKS. Finally the door, still chained, opens a crack. An eye peers out.

<WOMAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Christ.

</WOMAN_S_VOICE>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Do you realize I haven't gotten stoned since the trial started?

The door closes. Then reopens, unchained. Kitty stands there in a robe she's thrown on.

<KITTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eddie... A guilty client's not the end of the world...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KITTY>
<EDDIE>

	EXACTLY!

</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
He slams his fist against the wall. OS, NEIGHBORS SHOUT for him to shut up.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's liberating! I feel free!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
More COMPLAINTS, OS. Shouting back at the neighbors:
</DIRECTION>
<KITTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go fuck yourselves.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KITTY>
<DIRECTION>
Kitty turns back to Eddie. Tenderly:
</DIRECTION>
<KITTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eddie... go home. Get some sleep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KITTY>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't need sleep!

</EDDIE>
<KITTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need sleep. Some of us are mere mortals.

</KITTY>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Screw you too, Kitty.

</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
He turns, and skulks back down her hallway into:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. KITTY'S BUILDING - EARLY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A converted brownstone in Chelsea. Eddie sinks down on the stoop, head in hands. Presently KITTY emerges, and sits down next to him. Several silent BEATS. Then Eddie speaks., looking straight ahead, not at Kitty.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For years I've defended scumbags. Dealers. Hitters... And somehow it seemed fine until this kid came along who knew me as a true believer who'd fought the good fight and... but... he seemed so damned disappointed in who he found... and then, out of nowhere, here we were fighting to free an innocent man -- an innocent man, I don't see many of those in my line anymore and I thought, Wow, the kid brought me good luck, y'know? For one minute I was a true believer again. Well, my minute is up, Kitty. I'm going back to defending scumbags... But not just dope dealers anymore. From now on: Child molesters. Porno merchants. Repeat drunk drivers, and I'm gonna get 'em all off. Hit men... Send me every contract killer... None of 'em does time ever again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
He rises, faltering a little. Kitty stands, steadies him.
</DIRECTION>
<KITTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eddie. We can discuss this... after you get some sleep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KITTY>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie shakes his head. As he stumbles down the steps:

<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you, Kitty -- no more sleep for me.

EXT. GROVE STREET - NIGHT - LATER
</DIRECTION>

Eddie wanders up to his funky building.

There's a SLEEPING BUM curled up in front of the door. Eddie wearily leans down, to nudge the Bum aside. But it's ROGER.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The hell're you doing here?
	</DIALOGUE>

Roger awakens very fast. He jumps to his feet.

<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's Art Esparza?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think he hired Shu to kill Jimmy Chin... It wasn't a Chinatown gang hit -- Jimmy Chin and Art's wife were lovers! She just about told me...!

	You phoned up Art Esparza's wife?

Roger nods.

	And you spotted her in the crowd?

Roger nods. Eddie takes a breath.

DOLLY PAST the odd HOOKER and VAGRANT being led from booking to the bullpen. The unnatural quiet bespeaks the late hour.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PUSHES into Records, closed for the night... Pacing here is TOMMY, the cop who'd opened up the Exhibit Warehouse for Eddie, earlier. Tommy appears to have been dragged out of bed. Under his car coat is a flannel pajama top. Between tense puffs on his cigarette:
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dowd... We're even now...

PUSH PAST Tommy, to TWO FIGURES huddled at a desk in the corner. ROGER looks on as EDDIE rifles through a DOSSIER.

Pictures, warrants, complaints. We can't make out the fine print, only the PHOTOS as Eddie flips through them.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Skipping back two years.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
THE NEXT PHOTO - A grainy telephoto shot of Esparza emerging from Art's Supplies. His hair was thicker, he was thinner. Wore a walrus moustache.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Esparza was being watched by Narco. Suspected of using his warehouse as a drug drop... Surveillance terminated.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>

NEXT PHOTO - A set of mugshots. Esparza is dramatically thinner here. Lots more hair. Aviator glasses.

Eddie flips, faster, through the file.

Roger looks questioningly at Eddie.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This little prick is protected.

He glances, suddenly skittish, at Tommy -- who picks up on Eddie's paranoia and promptly reciprocates.

	That's it -- I'm outta here. You owe me one, Dowd.

	Dismissed...

As he gets younger, the moustache shrinks. Seven years back, and it disappears.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...dismissed. Shit!

<DIRECTION>
Eight years ago: Esparza's black hair is cut in a shag, and the glasses are gone.

	Shit.

<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've seen this picture before.

He reaches into his wallet, pulls out Shu's old mugshot. Holds the two mugshots next to each other. Hushed:

	They could've been brothers. It's why the eyewitnesses picked Shu.

The lawyers bound down the steps, dart into the street--

Roger feeds the phone.

Eddie squints down the street...

Even at this late hour we see enough decoration and signage to recognize Chinatown, not seven blocks uptown.

	How long did it take Badalato to drive Jimmy Chin's body from Chinatown to the morgue?

Eddie fairly pushes Roger out of the phone booth. Thumbs through the White Pages, finds the page he's looking for, tears it out and stuffs it into his pocket.

As he races for his Riviera, parked in a towaway zone:
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>

He hops in, revs the old heap.

Badalato lies propped up in his robe and socks. He's staring at the test pattern of a TV on his bureau. He's dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No he's not... Expressionless, still staring ahead:
</DIRECTION>
<BADALATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do I know you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BADALATO>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie crosses to the inert ex-cop.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm Eddie Dowd. I cross-examined you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But not very well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Badalato's eyes are shiny as marbles. On his night-table we notice a half-dozen prescription vials.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did you do with Jimmy Chin's body?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Badalato's lips part, but there's no sound. Eddie shakes him.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did you do with Jimmy Chin's body?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Badalato's lids flutter.
</DIRECTION>
<BADALATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I brought it... to the coroner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BADALATO>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	An hour after you picked it up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Badalato reaches for a vial, casually fishes out two pills. Drowsily concedes:
</DIRECTION>
<BADALATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	An hour later...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BADALATO>
<DIRECTION>
He pops the pills.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	From Chinatown... Which is right up the street from the morgue! Where did you go with the body? What did you do with it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<BADALATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please... I need to sleep...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BADALATO>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie slams Badalato up against the headboard.
</DIRECTION>
<BADALATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're fishing. You don't know shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BADALATO>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know about Esparza.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
A cloud crosses Badalato's face. OS, we HEAR:
</DIRECTION>
<CONNIE_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- It wasn't Vin's idea.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONNIE_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Connie has advanced to the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whose idea was it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Badalato tries to focus on his sister.
</DIRECTION>
<BADALATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Connie get outta here... this is official business...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BADALATO>
<CONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were pressured... Tell the man!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONNIE>
<BADALATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dammit Connie -- go back to bed!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BADALATO>
<DIRECTION>
As she backs out of the room, to Eddie:
</DIRECTION>
<CONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The little guys always take the rap for the big shots.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONNIE>
<BADALATO>
<DIRECTION>
(growls)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Connie!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BADALATO>
<DIRECTION>
Connie leaves. Eddie turns back to Badalato. Before he can resume his inquisition:
</DIRECTION>
<BADALATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Montell... one of my partners... he said it'd work if it was a thru-and thru.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BADALATO>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie inhales sharply. Lets go of the ex-cop. His voice shrinking to a near-whisper:
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's a "thru-and-thru"?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Badalato reaches for another pill.
</DIRECTION>
<BADALATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have this chronic pain...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BADALATO>
<DIRECTION>
He pops the pill, leans back.
</DIRECTION>
<BADALATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eight years I'm waiting for some genius to notice it took me an hour to drive seven blocks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BADALATO>
<DIRECTION>
He lets his eyes close. One, two, three beats. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<BADALATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I drove Chin's body to The Firing Line. Pistol range, near the Battery. Lotta cops used to go there...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BADALATO>
<DIRECTION>
FLASH BACK to NOVEMBER 2, 1980:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BADALATO'S POV - MOVING - MIDNIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he pulls the paddywagon into an alley, marked by a sign overhead: "THE FIRING LINE". The SHOT has the floating quality and irresistible forward motion of a dream.
</DIRECTION>
<BADALATO>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sklaroff brought Shu Kai Kim's gun. Montell was already there...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BADALATO>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PADDYWAGON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Badalato (younger, fit) lifts his end of the stretcher bearing the sheet-covered corpse. Slides it out, to Montell.
</DIRECTION>
<BADALATO>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He said we'd only have three hours. After that, with the body cooling, and the clotting... it wouldn't look right to the pathologist.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BADALATO>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PISTOL RANGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cops squat beside the stretcher. Badalato strips the bloody sheet down to the corpse's waist. Sklaroff grips Jimmy Chin's shoulders and carefully hoists his torso upright. Chin's head lolls, empty eyes staring.
</DIRECTION>
<BADALATO>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chin was hit once in the forehead by Esparza's .32. The bullet exited clean.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a thru-and-thru.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BADALATO>
<DIRECTION>
Badalato gingerly tugs on a hank of Chin's hair, to raise up the corpse's head.
</DIRECTION>
<BADALATO>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All Montell had to worry about was firing Kim's .38 at the same angle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BADALATO>
<DIRECTION>
Montell, with gloved hand, brings Shu's gun to Jimmy Chin's forehead. Tilts it, just so. And FIRES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEDROOM - BADALATO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ROAR of the GUN-BLAST, no less loud as it echoes in his head eight years later, has startled open Badalato's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<BADALATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We recovered the bullet and that was it -- an airtight case...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BADALATO>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie is trying to wrap his mind around this awful thing.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But why? All to protect Esparza?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Badalato reaches, unsteadily, for another pill. His lids have drooped again.
</DIRECTION>
<BADALATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nasty little bastard. He stepped in shit...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BADALATO>
<DIRECTION>
Badalato's head slumps. The impact of his chin striking his chest surprises him awake again.
</DIRECTION>
<BADALATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...we had to lick his boots clean.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BADALATO>
<EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
(realizes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was your snitch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<BADALATO>
<DIRECTION>
(sardonic smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our own Colombian Connection... For three years... Three years of ball breaking detective work. And we put a lotta bad guys behind bars.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BADALATO>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And one good guy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Badalato reaches for the vial again. Eddie grabs it first. Reads the label.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Demerol? What the fuck is your problem, man? You wanna die?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<BADALATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm dead. We're both dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BADALATO>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie hurls the open vial across the room: the pills scatter.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nobody dies till I hear the truth! Who ordered the frame on Shu?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Badalato stubbornly shakes his heavy head.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was wrong, Vinnie -- you know that! But we can make it right... if you'll fucking stand up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Badalato looks up at Eddie. His eyes fill with tears. Still he doesn't move. Eddie grabs the ex-cop's pudgy hands.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get up, godammit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
And Eddie hauls Badalato off the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie drags Badalato past Connie, chewing her cuticles.
</DIRECTION>
<CONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't hurt him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONNIE>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's the nearest hospital?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<CONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bellevue. Straight up First --
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELEVATOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Badalato is slumped in the corner. The car descends with painful slowness. Eddie nudges Badalato's shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay awake, Badalato. Vinnie... Come on, man, talk to me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Badalato's response: A faint SNORTING sound.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did I say snort? No, I said talk. Please... I need you to live...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(an idea)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey: When was the first time you got laid?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(no answer, then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, I sympathize, I blocked mine out myself. She had a moustache...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Finally the car stops. The door creakily slides open. As Eddie pulls the hulking ex-cop upright:
</DIRECTION>
<BADALATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Where're we goin'?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BADALATO>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That-a-boy. Hospital.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<BADALATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don' need a hospital... I feel fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BADALATO>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too fine, Badalato. The bad news is, you're gonna live.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
In response Badalato GURGLES -- it sounds, disconcertingly, like a death rattle.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Make y'a deal. You clean up, I clean up. No more dope.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(amends)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No more dope for a year.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(amends)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For the rest of the year.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
He hauls Badalato OUT of the elevator, and right into -- SKLAROFF AND MONTELL Montell, the burlier of the two, flings Eddie against the wall. With an odd, brutal melancholy:
</DIRECTION>
<MONTELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why'd you have to come here, you hippie-dippie fuck?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONTELL>
<DIRECTION>
Meantime Sklaroff helps Badalato down the access stairs as he murmurs soothing assurances in the ex-cop's ear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Montell roughly pat-searches Eddie:
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Montell... listen to me: Vinnie took a buncha pills. He needs a hospital.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<MONTELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Makes two of ya.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONTELL>
<DIRECTION>
He knees Eddie in the groin, then tosses him into:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ACCESS STAIRS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie tumbles down the short flight. Then picks himself up as Montell hurtles after him. Eddie makes a break, into:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
but ESPARZA's waiting here. He hauls off, smashing Eddie's head against the concrete wall.
</DIRECTION>
<MONTELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goddammit Art, get back in the car!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONTELL>
<DIRECTION>
Meantime Sklaroff walks Badalato past a row of dark sedans huddled like hearses... Past a mesh gate that guards the building's ancient furnaces, crackling with flame, spewing steam... To an UNMARKED CAR parked at the far end of the garage. Softly, suppressing his unbearable tension:
</DIRECTION>
<SKLAROFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vin... What'd you tell the lawyer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKLAROFF>
<DIRECTION>
He opens the back door, maneuvers Badalato onto the seat.
</DIRECTION>
<BADALATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lou...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BADALATO>
<DIRECTION>
With infinite kindness, infinite patience:
</DIRECTION>
<SKLAROFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm here, Vin. So's Dave. We need to know what you told the lawyer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKLAROFF>
<DIRECTION>
Badalato nods, slowly. A stoned, beatific smile forms.
</DIRECTION>
<BADALATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I came clean...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BADALATO>
<DIRECTION>
Pain stabs Sklaroff's face. He pats Badalato's knee.
</DIRECTION>
<SKLAROFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good, Vinnie... You wait here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKLAROFF>
<DIRECTION>
As he starts back to where Montell and Esparza stand over Eddie, Sklaroff draws the gun from his shoulder-holster.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His face, in the dirty yellow flourescent light down here, is a taut, shiny death mask. Quietly:
</DIRECTION>
<SKLAROFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vinnie told 'im everything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKLAROFF>
<DIRECTION>
Woozily, as he mops the blood from his brow with a sleeve:
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What, "everything"? You shot a corpse. I don't give a shit about that -- !
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<ESPARZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's snuff this lowlife!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESPARZA>
<EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Esparza)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey -- the fact you popped Jimmy Chin in broad daylight proves it wasn't premeditated. Jury'll sympathize -- dude was banging your wife, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<ESPARZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut your sewer mouth!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESPARZA>
<DIRECTION>
He lunges at Eddie. Montell pulls him back.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Killing me in the middle of the trial would cause quite a stink...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Esparza)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It won't be clean like with Chuckie. What, y'treat him to a match-head of pure smack...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Esparza shakes Montell loose.
</DIRECTION>
<ESPARZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right -- I'm a generous guy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESPARZA>
<DIRECTION>
Montell gazes with loathing at Esparza.
</DIRECTION>
<MONTELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Who'd y'waste now, Art?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONTELL>
<DIRECTION>
Meantime Sklaroff levels the gun at Eddie's face.
</DIRECTION>
<SKLAROFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goddam you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKLAROFF>
<ESPARZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do it. So we can go home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESPARZA>
<DIRECTION>
Sklaroff's finger twitches, on the trigger.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Still letting your snitch run you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Sklaroff's eyes flash. Eddie's touched a nerve.
</DIRECTION>
<MONTELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lou... We have to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONTELL>
<ESPARZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Waste him, y'little worm!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESPARZA>
<DIRECTION>
Sklaroff's gaze flies from Esparza to Eddie to Montell. All four men's faces are slick with sweat.
</DIRECTION>
<ESPARZA>
<DIRECTION>
(draws his .32)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay then I'll put this filthy lawyer freak out of his mis--
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESPARZA>
<DIRECTION>
Abruptly Sklaroff swivels, jams his gun against Esparza's ear and FIRES. As Esparza topples backward, eyes and mouth wide:
</DIRECTION>
<SKLAROFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up, Art.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKLAROFF>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie jumps up in horror. Montell blinks at Sklaroff.
</DIRECTION>
<SKLAROFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shoulda done that eight years ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKLAROFF>
<DIRECTION>
Waving his gun at Esparza's ruined head, Sklaroff hoarsely shouts at Eddie:
</DIRECTION>
<SKLAROFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see that? You wanna be like that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKLAROFF>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. No...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<SKLAROFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You fucking swear to shut up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKLAROFF>
<DIRECTION>
Montell registers shock at his partner's offer.
</DIRECTION>
<MONTELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...We can't trust this fuck...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONTELL>
<SKLAROFF>
<DIRECTION>
(at Eddie)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You gonna keep quiet -- ?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKLAROFF>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie considers for a moment that feels like forever. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't do that... Keep quiet? You can't ask me to do that!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<MONTELL>
<DIRECTION>
(explodes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shoot 'im, f'r Chrissakes!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONTELL>
<DIRECTION>
Desperate, Sklaroff kicks Esparza's corpse.
</DIRECTION>
<SKLAROFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the motherfucker killed Jimmy Chin. It's justice...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKLAROFF>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie nods... he agrees...
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I have a client eight years in prison didn't do it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Montell grabs the gun from Sklaroff.
</DIRECTION>
<MONTELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sorry bastard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONTELL>
<DIRECTION>
Eyes fixed on the gun, Eddie takes a step back.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My guy's gotta walk. You hear me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Montell swallows hard, then raises the gun.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You hear what I'm saying? It's over -- all the bullshit. Your bullshit, my bullshit -- all the lies -- that's it, party's over, enough's enough... Y'live a lie, you die inside -- don't you know that?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then, softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to go now. I have to be in court.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie turns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MONTELL'S GUN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pointed at Eddie's back. His finger tightens on the trigger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EDDIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
crosses the oil-stained concrete... past the row of black sedans, the clanking furnaces... barely able to breathe... waiting for the bullet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MONTELL'S ARM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
starts to shake, just slightly. He brings up his other arm, to steady the gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EDDIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
has traversed this humid half-acre of hell... he reaches the unmarked car. A bleary Badalato looks up at him, Eddie holds out a hand. His voice catching:
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vinnie... You coming?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Badalato reaches up. And takes Eddie's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MONTELL AND SKLAROFF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sklaroff places his hand on Montell's wrist. He helps his partner slowly lower the gun. Party's over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EDDIE AND BADALATO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
awkwardly walk up the ramp. The sun is just rising over New York City. The two men squint as they come into the light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COURTOOM - NEXT MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Pillars have bailed out. Shu sits at the Defense Table. Not happy to be here. Roger stands.
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your Honor, Mr. Dowd indicated that he may be detained this morning... He asked me to fill in for him...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This doesn't amuse me, Mr. B--
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens. It's EDDIE. Tattered, bruised and tired.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE PROSECUTION TABLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rabin nudges Reynard. It appears that the defense has been on a titanic bender.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Judge puts on a sarcastic smile.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good morning, Mr. Dowd. Do you think you might be up to cross-examining Mr. Ortega this morning?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your Honor: I imagine that, no matter how careful my questioning, Mr. Ortega would, in his well-intentioned way, dig my client's hole even deeper.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Judge Quealy nods. Not without a trace of compassion.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well then, does the defense have any witnesses?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I suppose I could find an inmate who'd say that Shu boasted about Chinatown just to survive in the joint -- though he didn't really do it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE DEFENSE TABLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shu looks up. Interested, again, in the proceedings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess I could find witnesses to dispute every point made by the D.A. But in the end, would we be any closer to understanding what really happened eight years ago? As Mr. Reynard has said, these matters are cloaked in secrecy... How can we, here in the safety and sanctity of this court, presume to pass judgment on Shu Kai Kim, a refugee...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE DEFENSE TABLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reynard trades smug looks with Rabin and starts packing his briefcase.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...who has spent his young adulthood like a caged animal in a prison where kill or be killed was the code...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His impatience tinged with pity:
</DIRECTION>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Then you don't wish to call any witnesses, Mr. Dowd?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would like to put Shu's alleged crime in a context, your Honor. And we do have the foremost expert on prison and street gangs right here in this room... If it please the court, I'd like to call Mr. Reynard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE DEFENSE TABLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DEAN RABIN looks outraged. REYNARD is merely annoyed.
</DIRECTION>
<REYNARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would ask opposing counsel to make an offer of proof that this is anything more than a desperate tactic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNARD>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you both approach the bench...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<DIRECTION>
Reynard strides up. As Eddie joins him:
</DIRECTION>
<REYNARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Can't Mr. Dowd find his own expert witness, your Honor?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNARD>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd need a continuance. Three weeks at least.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Judge Quealy sighs. He doesn't have three weeks to waste.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your questions would of course be restricted to Mr. Reynard's area of expertise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<REYNARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a last-ditch ploy, your Honor... The Defense clearly hopes that my presence on the stand will create the opportunity to call for a mistrial.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNARD>
<DIRECTION>
He flashes Eddie a grim smile.
</DIRECTION>
<REYNARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But the Defense is mistaken.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNARD>
<DIRECTION>
Reynard proceeds to the witness box. Though it's clearly a formality, the D.A. must be sworn in.
</DIRECTION>
<CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLERK>
<REYNARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNARD>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie ambles over to the witness box.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's start by establishing your credentials as an expert witness, Mr. Reynard. In the late '70s you led an investigation into a Colombian crime syndicate called "the Ochoa"?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
As though indulging a child:
</DIRECTION>
<REYNARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Mr. Dowd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNARD>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't this investigation, with its attendant publicity, catapult you into the office you now hold?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<REYNARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I were sitting where I normally sit, I would say "Calls for speculation."
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNARD>
<DIRECTION>
THE JURORS are charmed by Reynard's ironic bonhomie.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you do any hands-on work or did you just supervise, from on high?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<REYNARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Dowd, I was personally involved with all phases -- and principals -- of the investigation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNARD>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And who were the detectives who assisted you, Mr. Reynard?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
REYNARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
glances into Eddie's eyes, to read what's behind them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EDDIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His expression gives away nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reynard, as he answers, manages to sound perfectly casual.
</DIRECTION>
<REYNARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lou Sklaroff, Vin Badalato, Dave Montell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNARD>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The same three detectives on the Jimmy Chin case.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Judge Quealy perks up considerably.
</DIRECTION>
<REYNARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In those days, they often worked as a team.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNARD>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And who was Arturo Esparza?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Reynard hesitates. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<REYNARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think I know that name.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNARD>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- But you just said you were personally involved with all the principals of the investigation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<REYNARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't be expected to remember the name of every informant eight years after the fact.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNARD>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't say he was an informant. But since you mentioned it, wasn't Esparza your primary informant?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<REYNARD>
<DIRECTION>
(bristles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're trespassing into the area of witness protection, Mr. Dowd. Such showboating puts lives at risk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNARD>
<DIRECTION>
Heedless, Eddie hammers at him.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Isn't it true that without Esparza, you had no investigation?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<REYNARD>
<DIRECTION>
(scalding contempt)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you're a dangerous man, Mr. Dowd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNARD>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope so, Mr. Reynard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie moves in closer.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	On the night of November 2, 1980, did Art Esparza phone you at home to say, "I just killed a man in Chinatown -- people saw me do it"?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
The REPORTERS trade looks, then start to madly scribble.
</DIRECTION>
<REYNARD>
<DIRECTION>
(ice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNARD>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No? Then what did he say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
DEAN RABIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
has no idea what's going on. All he knows is that he must do something. He stands.
</DIRECTION>
<RABIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Objection. Badgering the witness.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RABIN>
<DIRECTION>
Judge Quealy's withering glance causes the Deputy D.A. to sink back down and stay down.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'd worked too hard to let Esparza's crime of passion spoil everything. You ordered your team to comb through the mugbooks. Find a patsy. Frame him.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Protect your case.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Protect your career. Isn't that so?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
The COURTROOM sucks in a collective breath.
</DIRECTION>
<REYNARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's an outrageous accus...
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNARD>
<DIRECTION>
Reynard trails off as, in the back of the courtroom:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIN BADALATO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is helped into the courtroom by CONNIE. Who pointedly sits her brother behind the defense, with Kitty and Mrs. Kim.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REYNARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A cornered animal. His gaze flicks from Badalato to Eddie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This time Eddie returns Reynard's gaze.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Putting away one punk enabled you to keep your informant out of prison and in place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
SHU has gone pale. Tears stream down MRS. KIM's face. KITTY reaches an arm around her shoulders, to comfort her.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By keeping your informant out of prison and in place, you were able to complete your work. Ultimately you saved scores of lives, didn't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
No answer. Now Eddie invokes the D.A.'s pet principle:
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was a trade-off, wasn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Quietly, with a kind of tragic dignity:
</DIRECTION>
<REYNARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A trade-off, yes...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd do it again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNARD>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie nods. Then returns to the defense table and sits, between Roger and Shu. Eddie looks drained but exalted. He can sleep now.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The defense rests.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PRISON CELL - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shu Kai Kim sits on the edge of his cot. Listens to the ECHO of FOOTSTEPS that grow LOUDER. In eight years of waiting, a man learns patience.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The FOOTSTEPS STOP, tumblers TURN. Still, Shu doesn't move; moving might break the spell. The cell DOOR slides OPEN.
</DIRECTION>
<C_O_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, Kim. Time to go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</C_O_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARKING LOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shu emerges from the Main Gate, toting a sad little vinyl valise. Blinking, as though he hasn't seen daylight in years. He heads toward the concrete depot where a bus will take him south, to New York City. How strange to walk without shackles, handcuffs, armed guards. OS he HEARS:
</DIRECTION>
<MAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Need a lift?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Edward C. Dowd lounges against his Riviera.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shu cocks his head, stares at the lawyer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie shrugs, stares down. Three beats. When he looks up --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shu is standing before him. Searching for words. Failing to find them. At last:
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit, man -- let's get out of here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Now ROGER steps out of the car, holds open the door for Shu.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE RIVIERA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spewing clouds of pollution, Eddie's car pulls away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RISE over the turrets and towers and electrified fences as Eddie, Roger and Shu drive away from the prison, to freedom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT: THE END
</DIRECTION>
