ALEX AND THE GIRLS

The flight attendants strap themselves in for take-off.

O.S., the ENGINE VOLUME INCREASES in PITCH and INTENSITY as the jet begins to taxi. Alex sits back as the tray over his lap. He looks out the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALEX'S POV - THE RIGHT WING

appears motionless in the f.g. as the tarmac and runway signs roll past the window. THE ENGINE PITCH RISES...

ALEX
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ENGINES WHIR as the jet gathers SPEED. He checks the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALEX'S POV- THE RUNWAY

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALEX
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
O.S., his classmates CHEER and "raise the roof." The trip has begun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PULLS AWAY FROM ALEX, as if reflecting his easing of annoyance with the tray situation. He finally appears to notice the raucous reaction and settles back in his seat, slightly pushed by mild-g force. The upwarding angle increasing...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cabin buffets, as if passing mild turbulance. Then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cabin sharply JOLTS! Everyone tenses, GASPS. CAMERA SWEEPS BACK TO ALEX. And just as he clenches his backpack... the cabin BANGS, ROCKS. THE ENGINES SPOOL TO A STALL. METAL TWISTS under extreme PRESSURE. The cabin dips, angles, sharply to the right.

<DIRECTION>
Passengers SCREAM! Unrestrained personal belongings fly across the aircraft INTO CAMERA, which BUFFETS and SHAKES...

<DIRECTION>
OXYGEN MASKS

<DIRECTION>
ALEX'S POV - OUT OF WINDOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The plane is on its side, losing altitude. A slow, sick spin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALEX
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
breaths deep into his oxygen cup.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The JET ENGINES GRIND AND WHIR, as if the craft were in the midst of a last-ditch effort to regain stability; the sounds DEAFENING over the PASSENGERS' cruelly hopeless SCREAMS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KA-BOOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A DEVASTATING EXPLOSION ERUPTS across the cabin, blasting a five foot hole in the fuseluge. Human limbs and blood spray, craft and passengers torn to shreds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dead students sit lifeless in their seats.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Every unrestrained object on board flies to the hole and through the fire; paper, books, luggage, pillows. A PARENT and a STUDENT clutch their seat in terror, SCREAMING before they are pulled into the sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wind. Screams. Dying engines, a deafening blare.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALEX AND TOD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCREAM, pale, knowing there is no hope, no escape as the ENGINES DIE. The cabin begins to tilt downwards... then straight down. Debris tumbles toward the flight deck as if falling from a cliff.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUTSIDE... the sick familiar SOUND of an aircraft going down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALEX is strapped to his seat, upper body facing downward toward the water. FIRE, WIND, AND BLOOD WHIP across him. A BUILDING WHINE CRESCENDOES before a second EXPLOSION RIPS ACROSS FRAME...

A half dozen MEN and WOMEN enter the room, displaying official badges and passes. All but two are dressed in casual clothing, having been called in from home; the pair being F.B.I.

Alex looks off toward a small unkept house, nestled at the edge of the woods. In the open garage stands Clear Rivers amongst cluttered artwork, supplies and tools. Her t-shirt's sleeves have been cut off and neck-line cut low. Her jeans have a revealing hole at the spot which once was a back pocket. She wears heavy black work shoes. A dog rests nearby on the floor.

She gestures to him to approach her. He tenses, awkward, but moves closer. Clear lifts a plastic cover off a canvas. Beneath is a mess of green and brown and orange; teen angst poorly communicated. Glued to the center is a twisted piece of metal.

While she cleans brushes with a can of turpentine...

<CLEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I've seen enough T.V. to know the F.B.I. doesn't investigate teen suicides. But they were there last night, that means: one, they still don't have a clue what caused the crash. Two, they haven't ruled out anything. And the fact that seven people got off the plane is probably weird enough, not to mention, that one of those people had a vision, or whatever, of it exploding minutes before it did explode, is highly suspicious. And it doesn't help that the visionaries' friend just committed suicide.

Alex eyes her for a long beat. She turns away from him, returning the can of turpentine to a shelf.

	You may not realize it, but we're all just a mouse that a cat has by its tail. Every single move we make, from the mundane to the monumental... the red light we stop at, or run; the people we have sex with, or won't with us; the airplane we ride, or walk out of... is all a part of Death's sadistic design leading to the grave.

<MR_BLUDWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If Life is like a box of chocolates... Death... Death is like a big Milton Bradley game of "Mouse Trap." The day you're born is just the boot, hanging from the streetlamp, kicking the marble to get things rolling. Growing up is only the marble rolling down the curving chute. You feel immortal having survived school, sex, drugs 'n' rock 'n' roll, but you've really only upset the big hand holding the steel ball that falls into the bathtub. Marriage and kids and career seem to make it all worthwhile until the ball hits the see-saw and flips the diving man into the big barrel. In the old folks home or the hospital you just see the big cage rattling down until it captures... the mouse.

Alex has moved closer to her house, remaining in the shadows. He checks for any passers-by. Being sure there are none, he creeps toward Ms. Lewton's car. He visually inspects the exterior. As he kicks the tires... an unmarked sedan SCREECHES up. Doors open...

INT. CABIN - DAY - A SMALL TABLE

A final piece of duct tape is applied to the corner of the table, dulling any sharp edges. Even though it is sunny outside, all the shades are pulled. The room sits in dark shadows broken by occasional bright shafts of light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA FOLLOWS a hand as it carefully picks up a Coleman lantern and sets it atop an empty can placed in the center and above the water line of a large metal tub; a fire protection moat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALEX
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
finds his way to a chair in the center of the room, away from everything except a nearby table holding a fire extinguisher and a first aid kit, both at less than arm's reach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unshaven, a week and a half's growth, and unkept, Alex looks horrible. An anxious zombie, especially in the dim glow of the lantern. Dark circles, from lack of sleep. Thin, from lack of food. Pale, from lack of sunlight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He places workman's gloves on his hands before picking up a can of Underwood chicken spread. With some degree of difficulty, he works the gloves beneath the tab and pulls. Careful not to cut himself, he reaches out and drops the lid into a small trash can.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alex removes the gloves and, with a plastic spoon, begins to eat. CAMERA PUSHES IN as he begins to chew methodically, chewing and chewing and chewing with concentration until... after steadying himself... prepares to swallow... then, carefully does.

Pause... he's alright. He takes the spoon. Scoops some more. And the process begins again.

Alex slams the door shut before it can open. Behind the door, a CRASH as something falls. Alex cracks a wicked half smile, cocky he has caught Death before this attempt has brought to fruition.

Alex removes the hook from the door and places the pole on the floor. He cautiously opens the door, REVEALING an old fish scaling knife embedded on the back side of the door, unaware. Removing the knife and securing it, his eyes turn towards the floor.

An old circular clothesline turns like a pinwheel in the wind. In the center of the yard is an oblong, tarped above ground pool. In the furthest corner of the yard, her dog is chained to a tree, BARKING AND FREAKED OUT. An old tire swing rocks in the storm.

IN THE STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The unmarked F.B.I. vehicle and two sheriff patrol cars pull up on the street. Schreck and Weine hustle out of the car.

ALEX
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
lurches back...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE STREAM OF TURPINTINE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is ignited by a single spark fom the power line. It flows toward the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALEX
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
backs away, eyes locked with Clear's, assuring she's remaining in the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLEAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
keeps her eyes locked on Alex, watching him. Suddenly, a BURST OF FIRE FLASHES FROM BELOW FRAME...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALEX
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
reacts, shocked. He realizes...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

SCHRECK AND WEINE

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
atop the car, whips, ARCS, warning everyone away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE COROLLA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clear can see the flames, her instinct is to grab the handle to get out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLEAR'S POV - GARAGE WALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fire roars angrily in the f.g., on the garage wall, however, the shadows do not match that of the flames, rather, the approaching form of Death appears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALEX
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
steps closer...
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>

<CLEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! No! Don't!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEAR>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When I do this.. it'll have skipped you... and it'll all be over.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
At that moment, Clear doesn't understand. She looks to him, scared...
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what to do. I'll always be with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches out and grabs the power line, falling back to pull it away from the hood of the car. The cable ARCS furiously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COROLLA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clear opens the driver's side door and runs out, knocked to her feet as behind her the car EXPLODES.

<DIRECTION>
ALEX
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is engulfed in the flames.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALEX'S POV - THE SHADOWS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the edges of the FRAME are collapsing. Alex's face, gray and emotionless appears, yet, before it can transform into decay...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALEX
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
through the flames, as if sensing the oncoming horror, defying the image...
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>

He looks toward...
</DIRECTION>

The power line ERUPTS! Alex disapears behind the wall of fire and sparks before falling limp on the driveway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLEAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Schreck, Weine and PARAMEDICS rush to the girl. Schreck turns back, calling out to a paramedic, helplessly watching by ther burning car.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHRECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is he alive?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHRECK>
<DIRECTION>
CLEAR'S EYES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
flash open, horrified, answering the question...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SKY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
a web of LIGHTNING CRACKS across the Heavens, as if Death was making a final angry proclamation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHRECK AND WEINE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA EASES IN on the agents, exchanging rattled expressions that convey their unease in the proof that Alex was right.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLEAR - OVERHEAD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As a pair of paramedics work on her, a soft breeze blows across the girl, and only the girl. CAMERA MOVES DOWN TO HER FACE, her eyes opened... welling with tears... seeming to realize... to sense, he is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DELIVERY ROOM - DAY - CLEAR

<CLEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We beat it, Alex.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEAR>
<DIRECTION>
Cleaned and wrapped in a swaddling blanket, the baby is placed in the mothers arms. The long retrospective harmonica of Neil Young's "Long May You Run" reprises as Clear looks at the I.D. braclet...

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"Alexander Chance Browning II."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DELIVERY ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PULLS BACK. The birthing room is quiet; the people introspective. The doctors. The family. The mother and child. A room of new life, in which, each recalls a life lost.

looks across the room...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLEAR'S POV - THE ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The breeze moves through the flowers... billows the cutains, posters and photos on the wall... until seemingly settling over the bassinet. The lace trim and blankets rustled by the breeze, it is hovering over the child.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLEAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA SETTLES, but her expression does not reflect fear. She knows Alex is here... and she smiles, tears welling in her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BABY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the bassinet trim settles, as if the presence is leaving. Before it fully departs...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

the wind softly and rapidly passes over Clear. He smile remains as the room becomes still and her eyes looks across the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hand ENTERS FRAME, fingers hover in space before they gently trace over "Terry Chaney." CAMERA ADJUSTS TO REVEAL Carter Horton, staring at the name. Alone, he allows himself the moment to grieve. Carter glances up to find Clear approaching with the baby in the stroller.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carter straightens and nods, then begins to walk away. He hesitates, then turns back to Clear.
</DIRECTION>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alex was right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<DIRECTION>

	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<DIRECTION>
Clear smiles. As she takes the baby out of the stroller...
</DIRECTION>
<CLEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I believe... that's what Alex believed. But how do we know... this wasn't the design all along?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEAR>
<DIRECTION>
