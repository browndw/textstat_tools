BEDROOM Lowrey tackles the first dealer to the floor. A LATINA girl screams. Lowrey unfortunately looks and takes a hard fist across the ear from the dealer. Angered, Lowrey swings his pistol up underneath the perp's jaw and knocks him through the bathroom door. Lowrey cuffs him to the sink. Meanwhile... Back to:

VENT ABOVE Where Ferguson is waiting with an air-powered tranquil- izer gun. He cuts loose a silent round that strikes O'Fee at the base of the neck. O'Fee stops. But before he can think to reach back at what hit him, his knees buckle and he drops to the linoleum. Out cold.

TRACH CHUTE ROOM Noah removes what looks like a flattened bobsled with large urethane wheels from the metal case and places it inside the air shaft. Ferguson attaches the black "scuba tank," labeled "NITROUS OXIDE," to a valve. This is connected to a metal-cased cable system that is piston-gunned into the floor. CUT BACK TO:

<DIRECTION>
HEROIN LOCKER Fouchet and Casper moving the stacks of heroin, placing them in the air duct on the bobsled. Once they're done, we hear RADIO GARBLE, then the sled is cabled to the con- traption. A button is pushed -- and the sled is pulled at breakneck speed through the duct.

INT. LOWREY'S BEDROOM - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Where Lowrey wakes up in a king-sized bed. The pain on his face and empty, scattered bottles tell us he's nursing a world-class hangover. He sits up, carefully, holds his aching head. Hearing BREATHING, Lowrey lifts the sheet next to him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVEAL THE LATINA The one from the Colony Hotel. He drops the sheet back over her head, reaches over to his nightstand and grabs an industrial-sized bottle of Excedrin. Empty. He opens the nightstand drawer, extracts another bottle. Empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATHROOM All marble and brass. Lowrey opens up his medicine cabinet. Locating a new bottle of aspirin... he suddenly realizes that the SHOWER is RUNNING. Confused, he pulls open the shower curtain slightly. From the back, it's an incredible body, then she turns around and it's -- THE LATINA Yes. The very same as the one he just saw in bed. What?

Six-year- old JILL, who is playing refrigerator magnet games on the fridge. And Marcus in the middle of it all, deftly side- stepping his eight-year-old boy, QUINCY, who appears on roller blades whizzing through with a hockey stick and ball.

INT. EVIDENCE ROOM - DAY Burnett and Lowrey know there's big problems when, at the bottom of the stairwell, the first thing they see is a yellow police tape and fingerprint team dusting a torched lock.

</DIRECTION>
<HOWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice of you to roll in. And nothing particular is going on around here except, maybe, your dope is gone. That's right. The biggest dope bust in the history of this department up and walked out of this locker, along with maybe my job and the two of yours if we don't get the shit back.

<BURNETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This can't be happening.

	You see, what's got me confused is, why risk leaving a witness? Why not kill O'Fee instead?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SINCLAIR>
<BURNETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because maybe this guy knows if you kill a cop the whole department'll get up his ass hard and fast.

	And who knows that better than anybody else? Cops.

	Not just cops. Narcotic cops. For example, the S.N.D. You've got access. You've got wherewithall. And most importantly, you've got the connections. Who else would know how to unload a hundred million dollars worth of heroin?

High atop the Biltmore, this is where the passageway leads out to. A door flies open and Julie appears. Panicked. Wind whipping all around her. A bird flies by, startling her. Hearing the APPROACHING THUGS, Julie sprints as best she can across the Spanish-tiled roof. Turns to see --

<CHET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say. How's that Mrs. Burnett?
	</DIALOGUE>

Burnett realizes this is going to cost him more. Gives him another ten. But for Chet it's still not enough.

</JULIE>
<BURNETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fair enough. I'm not on the take. Satisfied? Good. So... why don't you make yourself at home? Here's the T.V. remote. Watch yourself some 'Gilligan's Island' reruns or somethin'.

Julie steps forward and wraps her arms around Burnett. It's a one-way hug. Uncomfortable, Burnett doesn't reciprocate other than a palsy pat on the back.

<CHET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, Mr. Burnett. I'm getting off in just a few minutes, so... I could watch the door if you like. You know. In a chair. I could just sit in it. Outside the door like cops do when they're guarding shit.

</DIRECTION>
<BURNETT>

	Chief. I tried to set the girl up with a sketch artist but she won't. I tried to get her to come in and look at the mug books and she won't come in.

Howard fires another missed shot. He's so bad, it's all Burnett and Lowrey can do to keep from spiking the ball.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Big computer. Expensive --

	So what about me? I can't tell my wife I'm shacked up with a female witness! Besides, I think they made my car last night... I gotta stay close to home, just in case.

	</DIALOGUE>
</HOWARD>
<DIRECTION>
Lowrey and Burnett feel hammered by Howard. Upon retrieving his final brick, Lowrey passes to Burnett, who feeds back Lowrey with a heel kick to the rim. And Lowrey slams the ball home. They exit with Howard simply staring.

	Okay, but Mike. This is like a lot of pictures. I mean, this isn't something by the bedstand. This is a whole wall... And I know Max said you were just friends. That's why I was thinking, maybe... you could be... gay.

	Hey, man. Got some bad news. Your car got busted into. There's some uniformed boys in the parking lot wanting to ask you some questions.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOWREY'S CONDO - NIGHT Julie, still dressed for the evening, paces back and forth. Frustrated, she rips the tag from her dress, and sits back down at the computer. She plays with the keyboard and Noah's mug shot pops back into view. She stares at it a little too intently. Images flash in front of her, the sights and sounds of Max's death replaying itself in her mind. Snapping out of it, determined, she gathers her bag and exits.

INT. CLUB HELL - MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT And, believe it or not, the other side of the fishtank behind the bar. Burnett's at the urinal, blissfully relieving himself when Casper appears at his side. There's that awkward men-don't-talk-at-the-urinal moment until Burnett leans over...

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MEN'S ROOM - BURNETT AND CASPER Burnett's gun lays amongst the flapping carp and sea- weed on the floor. Both Burnett and Casper go sliding across the wet floor and into a stall -- both reaching for the gun. Burnett's there a second too late. Casper's got the gun. He swings it onto Burnett and squeezes the trigger. But nothing happens. Burnett in turn, grabs Casper's ears and hammers the big guy's head into the toilet until he falls unconscious. Burnett picks up his gun.

INT. BURNETT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT Lowrey climbs under blanket on sofa, the back of which faces the window. Exhausted, he turns off light and closes his eyes. A beat. Burnett's face pops up furtively in window, his nose pressed against the glass, looking for evidence of adultery. He can't see Lowrey asleep on the couch. His head drops below the window frame, only to reappear in another window. Seeing nothing, he moves on.

	</DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</CHET>
<DIRECTION>
Burnett pulls his gun. But doesn't hand it to Chet. He sticks it in Chet's face.

	Okay. All I know is his name. Foo-shay, I think. Got this heavy French accent. The word was he offs drug dealers. And there was quick cash for whoever had the balls enough to hook up with him. I swear, man, watchin' your house was my first gig for the guy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENCHMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Burnett stands over the Henchman and lifts his defeated chin to face him. Burnett has it in him to give the guy one more hard whack for good measure, but that bruised face proves punishment enough.
</DIRECTION>
<BURNETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. I guess you're tellin' the truth.

	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<BURNETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURNETT>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought that was the usual menu when cops were on stakeout. A little caffeine for the heart. Some sugar-coated dough fried in day old grease.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<LOWREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Man. Will you get off this? You're making me sick.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, lady --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURNETT>
<DIRECTION>
But Burnett's face ignites with headlights at their rear. Doors open. Lowrey checks the rear-view mirror. He sees two private security cops named DE SOUZA and TOWNE. They split and approach either side of the unmarked sedan.
</DIRECTION>
<LOWREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, man. It's the fuckin' pretend police.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOWREY>
<BURNETT>

</BURNETT>

Lowrey rolls down his driver's window in time to hear...
</DIRECTION>
<TOWNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, what do we have back here? Looks like we got us two pimps and a hooker.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOWNE>
<DE_SOUZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, fellahs. Maybe if she does us both we'll let you leave with your pride intact.

Burnett nods his approval. Lowrey lowers the window.
</DIRECTION>
<LOWREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, where were we?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOWREY>
<TOWNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Outta the car. Hands where we can see 'em. Feet spread.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOWNE>
<DIRECTION>
Both hobby cops open the doors for Lowrey and Burnett respectively. Looks pass between them as they step out and assume the positions. And Towne starts by frisking Burnett's shoulders.
</DIRECTION>
<BURNETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, that's not how you frisk a potential lawbreaker. You gotta start at the waistband. See if he's carrying a piece.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURNETT>
<DIRECTION>
Towne stalls a beat, then self-consciously goes to Burnett's waistband where he feels a --
</DIRECTION>
<TOWNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gun!

</TOWNE>
<DIRECTION>
Both hobby cops instantly withdraw, their own pieces drawn and leveled on Burnett and Lowrey.

<LOWREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoah. You better watch it, fellahs!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(very slowly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, it would be very bad if you shot and killed two helpless pimps and a call girl... But it would be even worse if you shot two policemen and their witness on a stakeout.

Looks pass between the hobby cops.
</DIRECTION>
<LOWREY>

	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(reveals his badge)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ooh, look at that. It's a detective's shield! All gold and shiny. A smart fellah wouldn't fuck with somebody who had one of these in his pocket. So... Let's see. I guess that makes us policemen. And you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOWREY>
<BURNETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURNETT>
<DIRECTION>
He shows his shield. Both hobby cops lower their guns, unsure about what's next. Burnett moves in.
</DIRECTION>
<BURNETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, some rent-a-cops have licenses to carry weapons, where others do not. Which might you be? You wouldn't happen to have those permits handy, would you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURNETT>
<DIRECTION>
From the looks on the hobby cops' faces, Julie can see that they don't.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. HANGAR 3 - GARBAGE TRUCK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It veers and swings over toward two nearby dumpsters. With Sanchez keeping a wary eye on the two bad guys and Ruiz to operate the hydraulics, Burnett and Lowrey drop from the truck and do their best working-for-the-city amble over to the dumpster. Business as usual. They wheel it over and position it in front of the two lifting forks where the garbage appears to be expertly lifted and dumped into the truck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON DUMPSTER As it lowers, the gearing seems to get hung up. The hydraulics' arms won't work, leaving the dumpster stuck in the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RUIZ AND SANCHEZ Begin speaking Spanish, one blaming the other for this fiasco. Angry words. Finally, Ruiz has had enough. He tosses down his gloves and hat and begins stomping off as if he's just quit his stinking job. He's headed right for the henchmen, his mouth moving and spewing and moving and spewing. The henchmen look to each other, not knowing what to think. Ready for anything when -- CLICK CLICK -- GUNS COCKING. Both Burnett and Lowrey are right behind the henchmen with guns at the base of their necks.
