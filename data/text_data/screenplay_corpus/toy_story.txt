...and leaps off the bed.

Buzz plummets straight down, hits a big rubber ball and bounces right back up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He then lands on a Hotwheels car, which races him down the track, through the loop, and off a ramp. Buzz soars upward into a plane mobile hanging from the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Buzz becomes wedged between the plane's wheels. The impact turns on the PLANE'S MOTOR making it (and Buzz) spin around and around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All the other toys watch from the bed, mesmerized.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally the centrifugal force causes Buzz to separate from the plane, sailing him across the room toward the bed.

Buzz makes a perfect landing right in front of Woody and then opens his eyes.

<DIRECTION>
INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A) Andy plays with Woody: jumping up and down on the bed, running around the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
B) Andy sets Woody down on the floor. Next he "lands" Buzz Lightyear on the floor opposite Woody. Andy shoots Buzz's laser at Woody and then smacks Woody across the room as if he'd been blown away by the laser.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
C) Andy runs into his closet wearing his cowboy hat and cowboy pajamas.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MATCH CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>

Andy runs out of the closet clad in Buzz Lightyear pajamas and a homemade spaceman's helmet.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Buzz Lightyear to the rescue.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
D) Woody observes all the cowboy-themed items in the bedroom transform to space motif: the posters, the drawings on the wall, the pillow, the bedspread.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
E) Buzz watches Rex execute a WIMPY ROAR. The space ranger suggests a few tips for the dinosaur. Rex tries again, this time giving a "JURASSIC PARK" ROAR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The roar blasts Potato Head's features right off his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
F) Woody passes Etch-A-Sketch, who's sporting a portrait of Buzz.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Woody looks across the room to see Buzz combing Troll Doll's hair, chatting away like a hair dresser.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Woody angrily shakes Etch, removing Buzz's image.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
G) Rocky, Snake, Troll Doll and Rex are lifting Tinkertoys as weights. Buzz works out on top of an upside down Robot, using his feet as a treadmill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Potato Head attempts to lift his Tinkertoy barbell but ends up tumbling backwards, leaving his arms connected to the barbell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
H) Woody looks under the bed for Slinky, finding only the checkerboard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Woody peeks around the corner of the bed to see Slinky and Robot, under Buzz's direction, setting Buzz's "ship" up on top of ABC blocks for repair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In frustration, Woody kicks the checkerboard, sending the pieces flying. One of the checkers ricochets off the dresser and boomerangs into Woody's mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
I) On Andy's bed, Buzz pets Slinky whose back end is stretched over to the other side where Woody sits. Slinky's wagging tail whacks Woody in the face repeatedly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Woody shoves Slinky's rear end off the bed, leaving his front end no choice but to eventually follow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
J) At bedtime, Andy loads his toys into the toybox until just Woody and Buzz are left. He deliberates as to which toy to keep and which to toss into the toybox.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy is sound asleep, with Buzz tucked under the covers next to him.

Across the room, Buzz's cardboard ship is still up on the ABC blocks. Buzz lies down on a skateboard and slides under the ship like a mechanic. Snake and Robot stand by waiting for instructions. Buzz's hand reaches out from under the ship.

INT. UPSTAIRS HALL/ANDY'S BEDROOM

Mom opens the door to Andy's room and steps in. The room is full of packing boxes, most of them half full. Andy is playing with Woody and Buzz.

The minute the door is closed Woody comes alive and shoves Buzz off of him.

<WOODY>

	One toy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOODY>
<DIRECTION>
He glances over his shoulder at Buzz, who is walking away towards the opposite end of the desk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Woody picks up a Magic 8 Ball left beside him on the desk. With his back to Buzz, Woody quietly shakes the 8 ball.
</DIRECTION>
<WOODY>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will Andy pick me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOODY>

He tips the 8 ball over. The triangular oracle floats up to the surface. Its prediction reads: DON'T COUNT ON IT.
</DIRECTION>
<WOODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't count on it?!! Doh-h-h-h!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOODY>
<DIRECTION>
Woody throws down the 8 ball in disgust. It rolls across the desk and falls behind it with a LOUD THUD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Woody suddenly becomes interested in the back of the desk and peers down it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE: BACK OF THE DESK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The 8 ball is wedged way down near the bottom. The space is a black chasm, dark and deep, just big enough to fit...a toy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Woody looks across the desk at Buzz.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is HUMMING TO HIMSELF as he forages through Andy's pen/pencil tray looking for "tools" to repair his ship with. Right behind Buzz sits
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE RC CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It rests on the desktop, pointing in the direction where the 8 ball fell, with the remote laying by its side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Woody smiles for a beat and then runs in a panic over to Buzz.

<WOODY>

Buzz runs over and looks down the back of the desk.
</DIRECTION>
<BUZZ>
	<DIALOGUE>

Woody picks up the remote for the RC Car and switches it on. RC's eyes (headlights) open sleepily.
</DIRECTION>
<WOODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, he's there. Just, just keep looking.

Woody hits the "FORWARD" button on the remote and steers the RC Car straight for Buzz.
</DIRECTION>
<BUZZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What kind of a toy -- ?

</BUZZ>
<DIRECTION>
Buzz turns to see RC headed straight for him. He dives out of the way as the RC Car SMASHES into the base of...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BULLETIN BOARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The impact forces pushpins to fly out of the board. Buzz ducks as pins land all around him, sticking into the desk like arrows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POTATO HEAD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
sits on the floor in the midst of a card game with Hamm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up at the desk and GASPS as the bulletin board slams down onto...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A GLOBE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
knocking it out of its stand. The globe starts rolling right at Buzz.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Woody stands frozen in disbelief at the chaos he's created.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Buzz runs along the desk, the globe rolling right behind him, Indiana Jones style. Buzz gets stuck "log rolling" on a pile of pencils, but at the last second jumps out of the way onto the window ledge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The globe lumbers past Buzz and strikes a Luxo-style desklamp. The arm of the lamp swings all the way around, barely missing Woody...
</DIRECTION>

...and knocks Buzz out the window.

Using his legs, Buzz pushes with all his might. The toolbox begins to move.

Woody notices that with every shove Buzz gives to the tool chest, the milkcrate begins to edge out over the lip of the desk.
</DIRECTION>
<WOODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, Buzz.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOODY>

Finally the gap is wide enough for Woody to jump through. Woody drops down to the floor below.
