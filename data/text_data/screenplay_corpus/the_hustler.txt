An old Packard coupé pulls up to a roadside gas pump. Two men get out and stretch their legs. The older man, Charlie Burns, a balding, desiccated man in his mid-forties, shambles toward the bar across the street. Eddie Felson remains behind to speak to the attendant.

Armstead's is a typical small town pool hall. It has a bar, a short order counter, a skee-ball machine, and pool tables for small, friendly games. The few people in Armstead's this day are not playing; they sit and read the papers. Charlie and Eddie are at the bar, drinking straight bourbon.

The game is in mid-progress. It's Eddie's shot. He downs his bourbon, weaves a bit, bends over the table, and awkwardly pokes at the white cue ball with his stick, missing an easy shot.

Henry ambles through Ames righting overturned ashtrays and replacing yesterday's abandoned cue sticks. The cashier enters.

Eight sharp. A departing customer holds the door for an incoming one: Minnesota Fats. Heads turn when he makes his punctual appearance. Fats' clothes reflect his high station at Ames Pool Hall: a gray felt bowler hat, and an expensive, tailored overcoat, with a carnation in its lapel and two silk handkerchiefs peeking up from its breast pocket. He moves like a sultan through the room, past Big John, whose eyes dip significantly, and over to the coat rack, where Henry respectfully takes his coat and hat. The buzzard-like eyes of the cashier direct his gaze toward Eddie's table. Fats withdraws a cigarette from his gold case, then casually strolls toward Eddie's table standing apart and quietly observing the sharp, precise movements of his prospective opponent. Even though Ames is filled with players, there is little noise other than the clicking of pool balls.

At his command, Ames comes to life. Players drag their chairs across the floor and position them around the main table.

The uniformed maids withdraw the cover off the green felt top, and Sausage, the racker, begins to bang the balls into the wooden racking triangle.

Willie takes the money. Two balls are rolled to the end of the table, and Fats and Eddie, like two duelers, prepare to shoot for the break. In the silence of the room, they bend over their cues and softly stroke out their shots. The balls roll down the table, bank off the far shoulder, and slowly return toward the two players. Fats' ball hits the closer shoulder.

</SARAH>

She returns to her reading. Eddie keeps looking at her. Her hair is brown, cut short, practically straight. Her lips are pale and thin, and the bone structure of her face, although delicate, is much in evidence. There is a suggestion of tired wakefulness, of self-sufficiency, about her. And a frank, open regard which has nothing in it to imply flirtation -- or the lack of it.

I mean, a couple more years with me, scuffling around them little towns and those back alleys. You might make yourself enough to get a little poolroom back in Oakland. Six tables and a handbook on the side. Is that when you say goodbye to me, Charlie?

A tear rolls down Sarah's cheek as she hears this. She stands near the door, with her back to both of them. Charlie gets up and moves toward the door.

	Thanks for the drink, Eddie's girl.

Sarah, her cheek wet, says nothing. Charlie puts on his hat and leaves. Eddie empties his glass and slaps it on the shelf next to Sarah.

Sarah hands Eddie his drink without looking him in the eye.

The room is a mess and Sarah is drunk. She sits on her knees on the floor, pecking at the keys of her typewriter with one finger. Her bottle and her glass are beside her. A bare-chested Eddie is in the kitchen behind her, tossing empty cans and bottles from the sink into a garbage bag. He carelessly wipes the sink, then throws down the dishrag and goes to the closet, pulling out his leather case.

He helps her up.

She doesn't answer. Eddie stares at Sarah as she sways limply on her knees, unmindful of her open robe. Eddie picks up the bottle and sets it before her. Taking her ashtray, Eddie rises, runs his hand through her hair for a moment, and then carries off the ashtray and empties it in the garbage bag.

The camera tilts upward from a Dixieland combo blaring out a bouncy tune to find Sarah, descending the stairs, looking on at the party below. Holding the rail with one hand, and a champagne glass in the other, she maneuvers her way down the steps. She stops a waitress on the way upstairs and exchanges her glass for a new one. We follow her unsteady, doll-like descent. She moves slowly, dreamily past the combo; past Eddie, who is cornered by a chic blonde in a low-cut dress; past Findley, alone with his drink, observing his guests; past the bleary-eyed couples on the dance floor, until she comes to the bar. Bert is there too, his head bobbing to the Dixie beat, his eyes running over her body so plainly covered by a cotton print dress. Spinning away from him, she takes her glass and goes to a corner of the room. Bert walks casually to her side. He leans over and whispers something in her ear. Her face hardens. Angrily she turns and throws her champagne in his face and smashes her glass on the floor. Then she starts to cry and starts to fall, but Bert holds her up by the shoulders. The music stops. The dance couples strain to get a look at what has happened. Eddie shoves through the gawking crowd.
