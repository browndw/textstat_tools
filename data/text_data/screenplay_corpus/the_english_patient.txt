EXT. THE SAHARA DESERT. LATE 1942. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SILENCE. THE DESERT seen from the air. An ocean of dunes for mile after mile. The late sun turns the sand every color from crimson to black.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An old AEROPLANE is flying over the Sahara. Its shadow swims over the contours of sand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A woman's voice begins to sing unaccompanied on the track. Szerelem, szerelem, she cries, in a haunting lament for her loved one.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE the aeroplane are two figures. One, A WOMAN, seems to be asleep. Her pale head rests against the side of the cockpit. THE PILOT, a man, wears goggles and a leather helmet. He is singing, too, but we can't hear him or the plane or anything save the singer's plaintive voice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The plane shudders over a ridge. Beneath it A SUDDEN CLUSTER OF MEN AND MACHINES, camouflage nets draped over the sprawl of gasoline tanks and armored vehicles. An OFFICER, GERMAN, focuses his field glasses. The glasses pick out the MARKINGS on the plane. They are English. An ANTI-AIRCRAFT GUN swivels furiously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shocking bursts of GUNFIRE. Explosions rock the plane, which lurches violently. THE WOMAN SLUMPS FORWARD, slamming her head against the instruments. The pilot grabs her, pulls her back, but she's not conscious. The fuel tank above their heads is punctured. It sprays them both, then EXPLODES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE MAN FALLS OUT OF THE SKY, clinging to his dead lover. The are both ON FIRE. She is wrapped in a parachute silk and it burns fiercely. He looks up to see the flames licking at his own parachute as it carries them slowly to earth. Even his helmet is on fire, but the man makes no sound as the flames erase all that matters - his name, his past, his face, his lover...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE DESERT. 1942. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE PILOT HAS BEEN RESCUED BY BEDOUIN TRIBESMEN. Behind them the wreckage of the plane, still smoking, the Arabs picking over it. A SILVER THIMBLE glints in the sun, is retrieved. Another man comes across A LARGE LEATHER-BOUND BOOK and takes it over to the Pilot. The Pilot is charred. His helmet has melted into his head. He's oblivious to this, cares only about the woman who crashed with him. He twists frantically to find her. Two men pick him up and carry him across to a litter where they carefully wrap him in blankets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE DESERT. DUSK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Pilot is being carried across the desert. A mask covers his face. His view of the world is through the slats of reed. He glimpses camels, fierce low sun, the men who carry him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. AN OASIS. DUSK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Pilot sees a man squat down beside him, takes a date from a sack and begin to chew it. Carefully, the Bedouin eases the mask from the Pilot's face, leaving bandages of cloth and oil, but revealing a mouth. He stops chewing and passes the pulped date into the Pilot's mouth. Mouth to mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DESERT. DAWN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CARAVANSERAI CROSSES THE DESERT, silhouetted against the dunes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. AN OASIS. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SOUND OF GLASS, of tiny chimes. A music of glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AN ARAB HEAD APPEARS ON A MOVING TABLE IN THE DESERT. It floats in darkness, shimmering from the light of a fire. The image develops to reveal a man carrying a giant wooden yoke from which hang DOZENS OF SMALL GLASS BOTTLES, on different lengths of string and wire. He could be an angel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man approaches the litter which carries the Pilot. He's still in the protective reed mask, wrapped in blankets. The MERCHANT DOCTOR stands over the burned body and sinks sticks either side of him deep into the sand, then moves away, free of the yoke, which balances in the support of the two crutches. He puts some liquid in the Pilot's tongue, whose eyes almost instantly begin to roll. Then he slowly sets about peeling away the layers of oiled cloth which protect the Pilot's flesh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Merchant Doctor crouches in front of the curtain of bottles and MAKES A SKIN CUP with the soles of his feet, then leans back to pluck, hardly looking, certain bottles, which he uncorks and mixes in the bowl he'd made with his feet. This mixture he uses to anoint the burned skin. Next he finds green-black PASTE - ground Peacock Bone - and BEGINS TO RUB IT on to the Pilot's rib cage. All the while he us humming and chanting. The bottles continue to jingle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ITALIAN HILL ROAD. EARLY 1945. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sand gives way to trees, the jingling bottles to distant church bells, as A CONVOY OF TWENTY TRUCKS - Red Cross vehicles and some supply vehicles - snakes along a bumpy hill road. The war in Italy is largely over and the Allies are moving up the country, the wounded and supply lines slowly following.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RED CROSS TRUCK. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A young CANADIAN NURSE, HANA, sits in a truck full of patients. Hana pays special care to the PATIENT lying in the stretcher alongside her. This is the PILOT - now known as THE ENGLISH PATIENT. A web of scars covers the Patient's face and body. They have the quality of a livid tattoo, magenta and green-black. The hair has largely gone and the effect is curious, lassoing his features, the strong nose, the eyes liquid. It's a warrior's face. But he has no physical strength. He coughs violently as the trucks shudders along the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ITALIAN HILL ROAD. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A JEEP pulls out of the line and approaches the Red Cross truck containing Hana and the Patient. The horn blows and Hana looks out to see it contains her best friend, JAN. TWO YOUNG SOLDIERS sit up front, one driving, both grinning. Jan signals for Hana's attention.

</JAN>
<DIRECTION>
Hana leans under the tarpaulin, holding some DOLLARS. The two hands - hers and Jan's - reach for each other as the vehicles bump along side by side. They laugh at the effort. Jan's GOLD BRACELET catches the sun and glints.
</DIRECTION>
<HANA>

	</DIALOGUE>
</JAN>
<DIRECTION>
The Jeep accelerates away. Hana sighs to the patient.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly AN EXPLOSION shatters the calm as the jeep runs over a MINE. The jeep is THROWN into the air. The convoy halts and there's chaos as soldiers run back pulling people out of the vehicles. Hana runs the other way, towards the accident, until she is prevented from passing by a soldier.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ITALIAN HILL ROAD. LATER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and there's still chaos as two SAPPERS arrive on motorcycles. One of them, a SIKH, wears a turban.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The motorcycles arrive at the front of the convoy. A nurse, MARY, is helping a doctor, OLIVER, attend to the injured driver. The other two bodies are covered with blankets. There's blood everywhere. The Sikh and his colleague pull out the paraphernalia of their bomb disposal equipment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ITALIAN HILL ROAD. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KIP, the Sikh Lieutenant, and HARDY, his sergeant, explore the road ahead of the becalmed convoy, using saucer-like METAL DETECTORS and HEADSETS. Kip is young, lithe, contained, utterly focused as they inch along the debris-strewn road. He stiffens as he registers metal. With a bayonet he carefully scrapes at the mud-caked surface. Something GLEAMS. Suddenly, A PAIR OF FEET walks across his vision as HANA HURRIES PAST, walking carelessly up the road. It's so surreal that neither man registers at first, and then Kip is shouting.
</DIRECTION>
<KIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! Hey! Stop! Hey!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIP>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't move! Stand ABSOLUTELY STILL!

</HARDY>
<DIRECTION>
Hana stops. Hardy gingerly follows her footsteps.
</DIRECTION>
<HARDY>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good, that's good, just stay still for me and then we're going to be fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARDY>
<DIRECTION>
He arrives at Hana. Then grabs her. He'd like to slap her face.
</DIRECTION>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing?! What the bloody hell do you think you're doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARDY>
<DIRECTION>
By way of an answer she looks at the ground ahead of her feet. Jan's BRACELET lies in the mud. Hardy bends down and collects the mangled bracelet, presses it into Hana's hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. VILLAGE. DUSK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CONVOY is threading through A RUINED VILLAGE, passing the souvenirs of war. An overturned vehicle now used as a game by some children, dejected refugees tramping along the side of the road. From the end of one of the buildings are hanging HALF A DOZEN CORPSES, strung upside down with crude placards denouncing, in Italian, their collaboration with the Nazis.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RED CROSS TRUCK. CONTINUOUS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hana sees all this as she sits blankly inside the truck, the Patient swaying alongside her. She puts out her hand to steady him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CONVOY SITE, ITALY. DUSK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CONVOY is making a PITSTOP. The trucks are silhouetted in a line. Hana helps lift the Patient's stretcher onto the ground. She bends to him.
</DIRECTION>
<HANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you need something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANA>
<DIRECTION>
The Patient nods. Hana gets up to prepare MORPHINE INJECTION from a small kit. Mary arrives. Touches Hana gently, conscious of her grief for Jan's death.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you okay? Oh God, Hana, you were like sisters.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<HANA>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We keep moving him - in and out of the truck. Why? He's dying. What's the point?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANA>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, we can't hardly leave him. Do you mean leave him? We can't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<DIRECTION>
Hana has settled down beside the Patient's stretcher. She draws herself up against the night. On the hill above, she can see the outline of A SMALL MONASTERY in the moonlight. She's crying, her face a frozen mask.
</DIRECTION>
<HANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I must be a curse. Anybody who loves me, anybody who gets close to me - or I must be cursed. Which is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANA>
<DIRECTION>
The Patient laces her fingers into his crabbed hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE MONASTERY. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hana is investigating the MONASTERY OF ST. ANNA, wandering through its overgrown gardens, past a pond. What sanctuary it seems to offer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE MONASTERY LIBRARY. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hana explores via a gaping hole in a LIBRARY where the walls have collapsed from shelling. The garden intrudes, ivy curls around the shelves. Bloated books lie abandoned, and there's a PIANO tiled up on one side. Hana presses the keys through the filthy tarpaulin which covers it. Everywhere there are signs of a brief German occupation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Past the Library is a CLOISTERS, drenched with silver light.

Hana goes upstairs, negotiating a huge VOID in the stone treads two thirds of the way up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE PATIENT'S ROOM. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She comes across a small CHAPEL, with the remains of murals and an altar pressed into service by the Germans as a table. Hana finds an old bed, and a mattress.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE MONASTERY GARDEN. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hana comes out, passes a DRY WATER TROUGH. She hears a rustling on the gravel and turns to see A TORTOISE ambling towards the trough. On cue there's A GURGLING SOUND. THE HANDLELESS PUMP IS SUDDENLY GUSHING, splashing water everywhere. The Tortoise, clearly arriving for this, enjoys a welcome shower. Hana goes to the trough, dips her hands into the water. Looks around her, and makes a decision.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CONVOY SITE. ITALY. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Convoy is in the final stages of loading up. Oliver passes the vehicles, deep in dispute with a determined Hana, who is carrying some sacks of rice.
</DIRECTION>
<HANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The war's over - you told me yourself. How can it be desertion?

</HANA>
<DIRECTION>
Oliver hovers as Hana adds the rice to a small cache of provisions, then lays another blanket over the Patient.
</DIRECTION>
<OLIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not safe here. The whole country's crawling with Bandits and Germans and God knows what. It's madness. I can't allow it. You're not, this is natural - it's shock. For all of us. Hana -

TWO SOLDIERS are helping Mary and Hana carry the Patient into the monastery. Hana indicates the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<HANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Up there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANA>
<DIRECTION>
They struggle up the stairs, one of the Soldiers gasping as he narrowly avoids falling into the void in the stairs. The cot almost tips up, at which the Patient SUDDENLY SPEAKS, his voice cracked and rasping, but still clearly aristocratic.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<HANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because you're leaning? No, you're just on an angle. You're too heavy!

INT. THE PATIENT'S ROOM. DAY.

Hana lets Mary take the weight while she goes to the bed and pulls away the drapes, sending up a cloud of dust. They lower the Patient onto the bed. She turns to the SOLDIERS.
</DIRECTION>
<HANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANA>
<DIRECTION>
She shuts the door on them, leaving Mary staring aghast at the room, its faded frescoes, its mold, its chaos. Hana smiles, opens a shutter to let a fierce envelope of light into the room.
</DIRECTION>
<HANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good.

</HANA>
<DIRECTION>
She goes to Mary and hugs her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HANA'S ROOM. THE MONASTERY. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A smaller upstairs room completely bare. As Hana tugs off her uniform, she looks out of the window to see the departing Convoy. A cotton dress goes on over her head and she emerges looking suddenly younger and rather fragile. THROUGH THE DAMAGED FLOOR OF HER ROOM SHE HAS A VIEW OF THE PATIENT BELOW HER. SHE LOOKS AT HIM. NOW SHE HAS SCISSORS AND STARTS TO CUT OFF HER HAIR, NOT AGGRESSIVELY, BUT IN A GESTURE OF A NEW BEGINNING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE PATIENT'S ROOM. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HANA walks down to the Patient's Room and stands in the doorway. The Patient turns his head to her. He's grinning. He puts up a thumb. On the track a song begins: Some Other Time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL. 1938. LATE DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SONG CONTINUED IN THE DESERT where we find the singer - PETER MADOX, a weather-beaten man who is working on the guts of an BATTERED TIGER MOTH AEROPLANE. His face is blackened with oil. A second European, ALMÁSY, stands beside him, holding tools and a section of the camshaft. Madox yanks out a perished rubber hose and holds it up for Almasy to inspect. Behind them is an ENCAMPMENT - some camels foraging in the meager scrub, half a dozen black tents of the BEDOUIN: guides and servants to the Almásy/Madox Expedition. It's 1938 and the whole continent is full of such expeditions, competing with each other, pursuing lost treasures, sources of rivers, hidden cities.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
D'AGOSTINO, the team's Italian ARCHEOLOGIST, drives towards the plane in one of the expedition's adapted FORD MOTORCARS. He gets out carrying a large earthenware WATER JAR. He looks very pleased with himself as he shows the jar to Almásy and then passes it to Madox.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't guarantee the vintage, my friends. I just dug it out of the hill.

LATER and a smart new aeroplane, a STEERMAN, makes a smooth landing on the flat desert. The expedition team drives over to meet the arrivals. Almásy is not with them. He's walking, apparently not so enthusiastic.

A young, kissed and newly-married couple emerge from the plane. They are GEOFFREY AND KATHARINE CLIFTON.

<DIRECTION>
And it's immediately clear that Katharine is the woman in the plane- crash at the beginning of the film.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Madox makes all the introductions. Hands are shaken, hellos all round, as the couple disembark in their leather flying gear. Geoffrey removes his helmet and, in what we will come to know as an ubiquitous gesture, produces a bottle of CHAMPAGNE and sets off the cork with a flourish.

	What was all the banging? Were you fighting rats or the entire German army?

</THE_PATIENT>
<HANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was repairing the stairs. I found a library and the books were very useful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANA>
<DIRECTION>
Hana shrugs. She's attending to him, pulling back the sheets, plumping up the pillows. He's short of breath.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_PATIENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Before you find too many uses for these books would you read some to me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_PATIENT>
<HANA>

	I think they're all in Italian, but I'll look, yes. What about your own book?

	<DIALOGUE>
	My book? The Herodotus? Yes, we can read him.

<DIRECTION>
Hana picks up the book and hands it to him. Then she starts rummaging in her pockets.
</DIRECTION>
<HANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh - I've found plums. We have plums in the orchard. We have an orchard!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANA>
<DIRECTION>
She has peeled a plum and now slips it into his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_PATIENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_PATIENT>
<DIRECTION>
His mouth works with the pleasure of the taste, a little juice escaping from the mouth. Hana mops it up.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_PATIENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The plumness of this plum.

A noise, GURGLING sound, disturbs them.

<DIRECTION>
INT/EXT. THE MONASTERY. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hana comes through the Cloisters into the garden as the gurgling increases. She's in time to catch the TORTOISE arriving once again in the WATER TROUGH just as it starts to gush with water. She shouts up to The Patient's open window.
</DIRECTION>
<HANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Water!

<DIRECTION>
INT. THE PATIENT'S ROOM. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Close on the HERODOTUS. The Patient opens its cover, held together by leather ties. Loose PAPERS, PHOTOGRAPHS, HAND-DRAWN MAPS AND SKETCHES are all collected between the pages. He claws at some water-colors which appear to be based on CAVE PAINTINGS - figures, dark-skinned warriors of the stone age, some with bows in their hands, others with plumes in their hair - arranged in abstract patterns uncannily like those of Matisse. Some appear to be swimming, another is diving. Then the Patient loses control of the papers and the whole parcel SPILLS to the floor with a crack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL. DUSK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SHOT RINGS OUT, disturbing the evening meal. Almásy and others go outside. Silhouetted on a ridge, a group of men sit astride camels. One of them holds his rifle aloft, clearly pointing towards the sky - means friend. Fouad peers at the horizon.

ALMÁSY AND MADOX WALK OUT TO INTERCEPT THE ARRIVALS as the first Arab dismounts, the procession of camels splaying out as if in collapse. Almásy speaks in Arabic, exchanging the ritual greetings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DURING THIS, FENELON-BARNES, sole European in this expedition, has finally persuaded his camel to sit, and dismounts irritably, slapping the animal in disgust.

</MADOX>
<FENELON_BARNES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it's certainly not between here and Dakhla. Nine days of nothing but sand and sandstorms. An egg. I found an ostrich egg and some fossils.

	Isn't Zerzura supposed to be protected by spirits who take on the shape of sandstorms?

EXT. BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LATER, supper over, the company is entertaining itself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Almásy, standing outside his tent, watches the merriment from a distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
D'Ag is nearing the end of a passionate rendition of Puccini's E Lucevan Le Stelle. He sits down to much applause from the others and SPINS AN EMPTY CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE on the sand. It comes to rest pointing at Clifton who gets up, grinning, and plunges into Yes! We Have No Bananas with great gusto. His version involves CHANGING LANGUAGE during each line of the chorus - prompted by Oui! or Ja! or Si! from the others. Song finished, much bowing and guying, he spins the bottle and it arrives equidistant between Fenelon-Barnes and Katharine - until with a little NUDGE from the husband it settles on his wife. Katharine gets up, awkward.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHARINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't sing.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(the audience groans)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	but I can tell a story.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Almásy, who has arrived)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I might need a prompt. Do you have your Herodotus? I've noticed you carry it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHARINE>
<ALMÁSY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry - what have you noticed?

Almásy looks uncomfortable.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHARINE>
<DIRECTION>
(reacting quickly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It doesn't matter. Really. I think I can muddle through. Okay - The Story of Candaules and Gyges. King Candaules was passionately in love with his wife -
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Geoffrey whistles proudly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One day he said to Gyges, the son of somebody, anyway - his favorite warrior -

	<DIALOGUE>
	Daskylus...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALMÁSY>
<KATHARINE>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, thank you, Gyges, son of Daskylus - Candaules said to him I don't think you believe me when I tell you how beautiful my wife is. And although Gyges replied he did find the Queen magnificent the King insisted he would find some way to prove beyond dispute that she was fairest of all women. Do you all know this story?

</KATHARINE>
<DIRECTION>
The men all encourage her to continue her story.
</DIRECTION>

INT. THE PATIENT'S ROOM. NIGHT.

EXT. BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL. NIGHT.

<KATHARINE>

(her story continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that evening, it's exactly as the King had told him, she goes to the chair and removes her clothes, one by one, until she stand naked in full view of Gyges. And indeed she was more lovely than he could have imagined.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHARINE>
<DIRECTION>
Almásy stares at her, framed by the velvet black sky. Katharine turns to looks at him.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHARINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But then the Queen looked up and saw Gyges concealed in the shadows. And though she said nothing, she shuddered. The next day she sent for Gyges and challenged him. And hearing his story, she said this -

	Off with his head!

	#NAME? death for gazing on that which you should not, or else kill my husband who shamed me and become King in his place.

</KATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
Clifton makes a face of outrage. For Katherine the story has collapsed. She wants it to be finished.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So Gyges killed the King and married the Queen and became ruler of Lydia for twenty eight years. The End.

INT. FENELON-BARNES TENT. POTTERY HILL. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PITCH BLACK and then A TORCH flickers on as Almásy enters Fenelon- Barnes' tent. He pulls apart his luggage, quickly and methodically. He finds what he is looking for inside a trunk: A LARGE FOSSILIZED BRANCH; a collection of stone leaves, wrapped in a piece of tarpaulin. Then he's distracted by a noise from Fenelon-Barnes' bed. Almásy stiffens, turns to investigate. There's A LUMP in the cot. A dog? Almásy eases back the blanket to reveal a YOUNG GIRL, no more than fourteen, bound hand and foot. He holds the torch to her face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL. MORNING.

The next morning. Almásy and Madox prepare to take off. As they talk Clifton's Rupert Bear taxis past them, a wave from Clifton and Katharine. Madox is very disturbed by what Almásy is telling him.

	<DIALOGUE>
	What did you think you were doing in his tent?

EXT. GILF KEBIR PLATEAU. MORNING.

<DIRECTION>
Both planes are scouting the Gilf Kebir region. Geoffrey flies up alongside Madox and wiggles his wings. Madox waves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They're flying over a distinctive group of GRANITE MASSIFS, Crater- shaped hills. The broken towers of the Gilf Kebir. Almasy is distracted by them. He turns to Madox and points down, indicating they should explore them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Madox gestures to the Cliftons to PHOTOGRAPH the Massifs. A THUMBS UP from Geoffrey.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE PATIENT'S ROOM. MORNING.

Hana gives the Patient his injection, now she begins to change the sheet. The light streams in from the open window. She looks up at the green hills rolling away from the Monastery, the village in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<HANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I should try and move your bed. I want you to be able to see the view. It's good, it's a view from a monastery.

	Zerzura, the White City of Acacias, the Oasis of Little Birds. As me about the scent of acacia - it's in this room. I can smell it. The taste of tea so black it falls into your mouth. I can taste it. I'm chewing the mint. Is there sand in my eyes? Are you cleaning sand from my ears?

The TORTOISE heads towards the trough, to the gurgling accompaniment. It reaches the shade only to be greeted by the obstacle of some tennis shoes, a frock. It clambers over as the water begins to belch out. Hana, naked, kneeling in the trough, receives the shower with a great YELP of shivering joy.

EXT. THE MONASTERY CLOISTERS. NIGHT.

<DIRECTION>
It's dark, but something is going on here. Hana is caught by the stray shafts of moonlight. She is SCRATCHING something on the flagstones. Her skirt is bunched up around her thighs. She throws something in the air. It's a SPILE, used to tap into the maple tree for syrup. It lands with a crack. Suddenly she is flying across the space, a hop, a skip, a jump. Then turns at the other end, dips for the stone, then back again, in this blindman's version of HOPSCOTCH.

Hana appears from the Cemetery, dragging A METAL CRUCIFIX. It's bigger than she is, and she drags it, as if approaching Calvary. A MAN WATCHER HER FROM A BICYCLE. He's approaching fifty, grizzled and attractive, and could be Italian. His hands are bandaged. Hana aims the cross at the soil, but is not quite bit or strong enough. The man, CARAVAGGIO, chooses this moment to introduce himself. He drops the bicycle on the ground with a clatter.
</DIRECTION>
<CARAVAGGIO>
<DIRECTION>
(very cheerful)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Buon' Giorno!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARAVAGGIO>
<DIRECTION>
Hana turns, startled and suspicious.
</DIRECTION>
<CARAVAGGIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you Hana?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARAVAGGIO>
<HANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you want?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANA>
<CARAVAGGIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I met your friend Mary. She said I should stop and see if you were okay. Apparently we're neighbors - my house is two blocks from yours in Montreal. Cabot, north of Laurier. Bonjour.
	</DIALOGUE>

<HANA>
<DIRECTION>
(unraveling this information)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bonjour.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANA>
<DIRECTION>
He goes to her and - putting a bandaged hand behind her ear - PRODUCES AN EGG. He beams, as does Hana.
</DIRECTION>
<CARAVAGGIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like to take credit, but it's from Mary. My name's David Caravaggio, but nobody ever called me David. Caravaggio they find to absurd to miss out on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARAVAGGIO>
<DIRECTION>
During this he attempts the same thing with his other hand to Hana's other ear. THE EGG DROPS TO THE GROUND. Cursing, he gets on his knees and starts to scoop it up, preserving it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE MONASTERY. KITCHEN. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hana has taken his eggs and put them into a bowl. She beats them with a knife picking out the bits of shell. Caravaggio watches, takes in how little food there is otherwise. The table seems useful more as a sewing area than for cooking - it's STREWN WITH ALTAR CLOTHS being sewn into drapes. On a tray on the table are TWO PHIALS OF MORPHINE from the Patient's room. As Hana turns to the stove, he's moved and covered them with his bandaged hands, a second later and he's juggled them into his pockets with the slightest clink. Hana looks at him. He shrugs, nods at the eggs.
</DIRECTION>
<CARAVAGGIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're fresh. I haven't eaten an egg in...have you noticed there are chickens? You get chickens in Italy but no eggs. In Africa there were always eggs, but never chickens. Who separates them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARAVAGGIO>
<HANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were in Africa?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANA>
<CARAVAGGIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, for a while.

</CARAVAGGIO>
<HANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So was my Patient.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANA>
<CARAVAGGIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like to stay. That's the long and short of it. I mean, you know blah-blah if it's convenient, if there's room blah-blah-blah. I have to do some work here -I speak the language. There are Partisans to be -
	</DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	#NAME? relieve them of their weapons, you know - while we hug. I was a thief, so they think I'd be good at that.

	So you can shoot a pistol?

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARAVAGGIO>
<HANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you said yes I would have had a reason. You should let me redress those bandages. Before you go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANA>
<CARAVAGGIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm okay. Look, it's a big house. We needn't disturb each other. I can shoot a pistol! I'll sleep in the stables. I don't care where I sleep. I don't sleep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARAVAGGIO>
<HANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because we're fine here. I don't know what Mary told you about me, but I don't need company, I don't need to be looked at.

	Me? He can't. I'm already disturbed.

	<DIALOGUE>
	There's a war. Where you come from becomes important. And besides - we're vulnerable here. I keep hearing noises in the night. Voices.

The Patient says nothing. She puts a spoonful of the omelette into his mouth. He grunts.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A STREET MARKET in full sway, a locals-only affair, blazing with noise and bustle and barter. Emerging from a thicket of women and begging children, KATHARINE CLIFTON carries her purchase of an exotic-looking RUG. From nowhere she is joined by Almásy.

</KATHARINE>
<ALMÁSY>

THIS CONVALESCENCE HOSPITAL HAS BEEN FASHIONED FROM A LONG ROW OF BATHING CABINS ON THE COAST, complete with Campari Umbrellas and metal tables, at which are seated the bandaged and the dying and the comatose, staring out to sea or in slow, muted conversation.

A battered open backed TRUCK comes into the Monastery. An ITALIAN PARTISAN sits in the back, a SHOTGUN resting on his knees. The truck stops, and Caravaggio emerges from the passenger door. He collects some packages from the PARTISAN, including a dead RABBIT, and then exchanges a few words with the driver. Hana, who's watching all of this from her garden, sees that the driver is a WOMAN. The woman's name is GIOIA, and Caravaggio leans into the window to make his goodbye to her.

Hana, the rabbit still in her hands, comes along the corridor to find Caravaggio SLUMPED on the floor, retching. The discarded NEEDLE lies beside him, the new package of MORPHINE CAPSULES ripped open. He looks up at Hanna, glazed.

Almásy squats with an ANCIENT ARAB outside his rudimentary house, while he draws on the sand, talking in some arcane dialect, scratching out a possible location for the lost oasis. The man stops speaking and scours the sky a beat or two before we or Almasy hear the faint noise of a PLANE. It's Clifton's Steerman, Rupert Bear, coming in to land. Almasy doesn't look up.

The Arab continues to talk. The newly-arrived Katharine has scrambled up the hill to speak to Almásy.

<ALMÁSY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is an incredible story - about a man hunting an Ostrich, he's been telling me about Zerzura, he thinks he's been there, but his map, the route he's describing, he couldn't survive the journey now, but he's a poet, so his map is poetry - and now we're onto an Ostrich.

<KATHARINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sounds perfectly clear. Where does the Ostrich come in?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHARINE>
<ALMÁSY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Ostrich is a detour. A poor man hunts an ostrich, it's the method. Nothing to do with Zerzura. To catch an ostrich you must appear not to move. The man finds a place where the ostrich feeds, a wadi, and stands where the ostrich can see him, on the horizon, and doesn't move, doesn't eat - otherwise the ostrich will run. At nightfall, he moves, fifty, sixty yards. When the ostrich comes the next day, the man is there, but he's nearer.

The Guide speaks, amplifying something, picking at his robe.
</DIRECTION>
<ALMÁSY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, the ostrich, it will feed a family, not just the meat, but by selling the feathers, beak, the skin, a year from this one animal. So, each day the man gets closer. And the ostrich is not sure - has something changed? - now the standing man is only a few yards from where it feeds. And then one day, the man is in the wadi, in the water. And the Ostrich comes, as always, dips into the water and the man JUMPS UP - and captures it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALMÁSY>
<DIRECTION>
He shrugs. The Arab has more to say. Almásy doesn't respond, quieting him with a dismissive gesture.

FENELON-BARNES sits astride his camel, and wipes away the sweat. The desert stretches for miles, shimmering, the sun baking the sand. His GUIDES wind their headcloths tighter. Nobody speaks. Then one of them looks round, raises a hand. A BUZZING noise. They all turn. A SMALL CLOUD OF DUST EMERGES OVER A RIDGE. Locusts? A sandstorm?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CARAVAN OF CARS, the Almásy/Madox expedition, bumps along, suspensions threatened by the constant dips and ridges. On each car there are three in the passenger cabin, the open backs crammed with drums of gasoline and water and equipment. On the front vehicle, the tenth member of the party, KAMAL, acts as a navigator and sits on a CAMEL SADDLE, a rodeo cowboy, on the roof of the leading car, driven by Madox. As they spot FENELON-BARNES they sound their horns and wave good-naturedly. F-B scowls, watches them roar by, stealing his thunder.

	I've been thinking about - how does somebody like you decide to come to the desert? What is it? You're doing whatever you're doing - in your castle, or wherever it is you live, and one day, you say, I have to go to the desert - or what?
	</DIALOGUE>

Almásy doesn't answer. Katharine, who has looked at him for an answer, looks away. There's another long silence.

The group is investigating a cleft in the rocky massif. They climb slowly. Below them, A NEW AND TEMPORARY BASE CAMP.

The group winds around the rock. Almásy turns to offer a hand to Katharine behind him, pulling her up to the next rock slab. She smiles at him. He smiles back curtly, continues.

The group stops at a level plateau. The Arabs stand apart and SING THEIR PRAYERS AT DUSK. Al Auf leads the incantations.

The westerners wait respectfully. As the sun sets in glory, Almásy looks over at the range of rocks. One particular range seems to look exactly like A WOMAN'S BACK. He squints at the rock. Almásy discreetly pulls out his COMPASS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CAVE OF SWIMMERS. DUSK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Almásy clambers up the rocks, coming through a narrow crevice to find A NATURAL SHELF. He scrambles up this path, reaching up, only to notice that his hand almost perfectly covers A PAINTED HAND on the rock, and as he digests this he realizes he has climbed past what is THE MOUTH OF A CAVE. He disappears inside.

A FLASHLIGHT squirts into the cave. Almásy treads cautiously along the narrow winding passage. He comes to an open cavern and takes his flashlight up to a wall. PAINTINGS EMERGE, figures, animals, ancient pictures. A giraffe. Cattle. Fish. Men with bows and arrows. Almásy is astonished by what he sees.

Almásy has led the whole party into the heart of the cave. Now Madox comes alongside him at the wall, his flashlight joining Almásy's and increasing the visibility of the paintings. A dark-skinned figure, apparently in the process of DIVING into water, comes clearly into view. Then others supine, arms outstretched.

A hive of activity. The team has set up TRESTLES to catalogue the finds as the Bedouin come out with baskets of detritus, which they empty onto a growing heap as the Cave is cleared out. Entering the cave, Almásy passes with camera equipment, just as D'Ag emerges carrying the corpse of a perfectly preserved DESERT FOX. D'Ag gestures to Almasy with his customary enthusiasm, holding up the body of the fox.

Bermann is driving the lead CAR along some STEEP DUNES. Almásy beside him. Bermann is peeling AN ORANGE, a segment of which he holds out of the window. Kamal, riding shotgun, leans down and collects it, his head dipping in to grin at Bermann. Bermann looks uneasily as Almásy. He wants to tell him of his passion, of his absolute love for Kamal, but he daren't.

<DIRECTION>
Bermann holds out another segment of the orange, and watches the slim brown hand collect it. A MOMENTARY DISTRACTION IS ALL IT TAKES FOR HIM TO MISJUDGE THE LINE AND SUDDENLY THE DUNE COLLAPSES UNDER THE TIRE AND THE CAR LURCHES SIDEWAYS AND TOPPLES OVER THE EDGE. D'Ag - following, Fouad beside him - brakes sharply, but can't stop his own car from being caught in the avalanche of sand, and IT PLUNGES DOWN THE DUNE AND INTO BERMANN'S UPTURNED CAR WITH AN OMINOUS CRUNCH, the radiator exploding. Only Madox, Katharine beside him, and a little way behind, manages to stay clear of the trouble. He jumps out of the vehicle and slides down the dune to find pandemonium as the passengers stumble out of the cars, sand flying, smoke pouring from the upright vehicle, the wheels of the overturned car spinning wildly in the air, a puddle of oil spreading ominously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE DESERT. DAY.

LATER and the group have cleaned up as best as possible. D'Ag, Bermann, and Fouad are a little worse for wear. Fouad's arm is in a sling, and D'Ag is sporting a bloody head-bandage. Bermann has broken a finger and is being attended to by Madox. The luggage, water and petrol have been stacked up and the men are loading up the remaining car. Almásy is working at the crumpled end of the vehicle. He's having no success.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Almásy, Kamal and two of the other young Bedouin stand around the mess of the two broken vehicles. The ONE WORKING CAR is loaded with men and provisions. Katharine sits inside, next to Madox, Almásy comes over to her window, to speak past her to Madox.

It's hard to argue with this logic. Almásy shrugs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LATER - THE MADOX CAR makes a more effective departure. And Almasy and Katharine are left alone. THEY LOOK AT EACH OTHER as if realizing this for the first time. Almasy immediately returns to the two damaged vehicles and helps the men stretch the cut canvas which was once a tent TO FASHION A MAKESHIFT SHELTER BETWEEN THE TWO CARS. Katharine goes to join them. There is no obstacle to the remorseless horizon, just miles of undulating dunes.

	<DIALOGUE>
	What am I looking at?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHARINE>
<ALMÁSY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See what's happening to them - the stars.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALMÁSY>
<KATHARINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're so untidy. I'm just trying to rearrange them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHARINE>
<ALMÁSY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In an hour there will be no stars. The air is filling with sand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALMÁSY>
<DIRECTION>
He offers a hand. A little reluctantly she takes it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SHELTER. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The team hurries around the improvised tent, weighing it down with packing cases, gasoline drums, water cans, bringing anything loose or light inside the tarpaulin. THE WIND is whipping up, the air busy with sand. Almásy pushes everyone under cover.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SHELTER. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SAND SEEMS TO BE SCOURING THE TARPAULIN. Kamal and Almásy try to secure one vulnerable area, but suddenly there are leaks everywhere and the sand swarms inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's noisy, too, and Almásy has to shout to make himself understood, indicating to the Bedouin to grab water and blankets and food, all the valuables, and get out. He himself finds blankets and water and shouts at Katharine to do the same. One side of the canvas suddenly RIPS apart like paper. Chaos as figures struggle in ever-worsening conditions, sand blizzarding the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SHELTER. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SHELTER FLIES INTO THE AIR, stranding the figures, their heads wrapped in blankets, flashlights useless. They seek safety in two groups, the tribesmen to the cabin of the overturned car, Katharine and Almásy to the upright one.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAR. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside the cabin, the sand swirling around them, Katharine and Almásy sit without speaking. Dawn is trying to break through. He pours a little water into a mug so that they can wash out their eyes and noses and mouths. She takes her silk scarf and first dries her eyes with it, then dries his.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHARINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is not very good, is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHARINE>
<ALMÁSY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALMÁSY>
<KATHARINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shall we be all right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHARINE>
<ALMÁSY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Absolutely.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALMÁSY>
<KATHARINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes is a comfort. Absolutely is not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHARINE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE DESERT. DAWN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sand is piling up against the two cars, the tent is swept from its moorings, the water cans are hurled up too, and then plunge ominously into sand drifts as if going under an ocean.
</DIRECTION>
<ALMÁSY>
<DIRECTION>
(O/S)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...let me tell you about winds. There is a whirlwind in Southern Morocco, the Aajej, against which the fellahin defend themselves with knives. The Ghibli from Tunis rolls and rolls and produces a rather strange nervous condition...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALMÁSY>
<DIRECTION>
And we hear Katharine's laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAR. DAWN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Almasy sits alongside Katharine, whose head is against his shoulder. He continues his story of winds.
</DIRECTION>
<ALMÁSY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	#NAME? Which Mariners called the sea of darkness. Red sand from this wind has flown as far as the south coast of England, producing showers so dense they were mistaken for blood.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALMÁSY>
<DIRECTION>
Almasy checks to see if Katharine is still awake.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHARINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fiction. We had a house on that coast and it never rained blood. Go on. More.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHARINE>
<ALMÁSY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All true. Herodotus, your friend, tells of a wind - the Simoon - so evil that a nation declared war on it and marched out to fight it in full battle dress, their swords raised.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALMÁSY>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE DESERT. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MORNING. The sand has almost COMPLETELY ENGULFED the car on the exposed side, covering the windshield like snow, and encroaching onto the door of the protected flank.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAR. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Almásy is woken by sound of A DISTANT ENGINE. He jerks up, waking Katharine in the process, and heaves against the door. He can't open it, and has to lean his feet against the passenger door, lying across Katharine, kicking it open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE DESERT. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
By the time Almásy emerges from the car, the sand pouring into the cabin, MADOX'S CAR IS ROARING ALONG THE HORIZON. Almásy waves, shouts, and then runs back into the car, finds his flare-gun, and SENDS A FLARE high into the sky. Katharine is with him now, and they watch, helplessly, as the car bounces away from them, Madox a man on a mission. Katharine panics, THE SAND HAS ERASED ALL TRACES OF THEM. She speaks quietly, shocked.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHARINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our tracks, where are they?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHARINE>
<DIRECTION>
Almásy is preoccupied. He's gone back to their vehicle and returns with a shovel, STARTS TO DIG FRANTICALLY.
</DIRECTION>
<ALMÁSY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Madox will have calculated how many miles, they'll soon turn around.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALMÁSY>
<KATHARINE>
<DIRECTION>
(realizing what he's doing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God, the others!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHARINE>
<DIRECTION>
She kneels with him and helps to shovel away the sand WHICH HAS COMPLETELY ENGULFED THE OTHER VEHICLE containing the three Bedouin.
</DIRECTION>
<ALMÁSY>
<DIRECTION>
(during this)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could I ask you, please, to paste you paintings into my book? I should like to have them. I should be honored.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALMÁSY>
<KATHARINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course. Is it, am I a terrible coward to ask how much water we have?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHARINE>
<ALMÁSY>
<DIRECTION>
(shoveling hard)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Water? Yes, we have water, we have a little in our can, we have water in the radiator which can be drunk. Not at all cowardly, extremely practical.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(anxious at not uncovering the boys, egging himself on)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, come on!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then back to Katharine)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's also a plant - I've never seen it but I'm told you can cut a piece the size of a heart from this plant and the next day it will be filled with a delicious liquid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALMÁSY>
<KATHARINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Find that plant. Cut out its heart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHARINE>
<DIRECTION>
They hear NOISES, scrabbling, faint thumps. Almásy scrapes at the sand and they find the glass of the car. The angle of the cab, tilted up to the sky, has made it impossible for the trapped boys to lever it open. Their oxygen is rapidly deteriorating. Almásy pulls the door and it cranks open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE DESERT. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Katharine sits in the car, putting her pictures into the Herodotus. It's full of ALMÁSY'S HANDWRITING, PHOTOGRAPHS, SOME PRESSED FLOWERS. She deciphers a page of his words and drawings. It's almost exclusively about her, the lines studded with K.s. She reads, astonished, then looks at him as he and two of the three Bedouin circle the area of the cars in ever-widening circles, like water-diviners, like Kip searches for mines. Kamal is slumped against the front of the car. He's sick. Almásy suddenly drops to his knees and begins to shovel into the sand. He pulls out A CAN OF WATER. Turns to Katharine and holds it triumphantly in the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE DESERT. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a small, weak fire. The group crouch around it. The boys talk noisily to Almásy. Kamal is wrapped in a blanket and shivering. Almásy gives him water, speaks to Katherine.
</DIRECTION>
<ALMÁSY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kamal is passing blood. He must have had some internal damage in the crash. He needs medicine. I think we must risk the other flare.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALMÁSY>
<DIRECTION>
He gets up and loads the flare with what is clearly the last charge. This time the effect is dramatic with A RED UMBRELLA OF LIGHT. Katharine comes up beside him. They wait, hope fading with the flare.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHARINE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Geoffrey's not in Cairo.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Almásy looks at her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's not actually a buffoon. And the plane wasn't a wedding present. It belongs to the British Government. They want aerial maps of the whole North Africa. So I think he's in Ethiopia. In case you were counting on his sudden appearance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHARINE>
<ALMÁSY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the marriage - is that a fiction?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALMÁSY>
<DIRECTION>
There's a beat. Katharine has a hundred answers.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHARINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, the marriage isn't a fiction.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHARINE>
<DIRECTION>
The light from the flare fades on them and they stand in the dark. Suddenly on the far horizon, behind their heads, AN ANSWERING FLARE fireworks into the sky.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHARINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank God. Oh, thank God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHARINE>
<DIRECTION>
There's excited shouting from the two fit boys. They leap up and run towards the couple, who meanwhile have realized that the flare has not come from Madox, but from an approaching CAMEL CARAVAN. Almásy shouts to the boys for some identification.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHARINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do they know them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHARINE>
<ALMÁSY>
<DIRECTION>
(squinting at the horizon)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, but I think I do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALMÁSY>
<DIRECTION>
The Caravan slowly comes into focus. IT'S FENELON-BARNES. Katharine touches Almásy's arm - an almost imperceptible gesture.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHARINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Am I K. in your book? I think I must be.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHARINE>
<DIRECTION>
Almásy turns to her. He runs the blade of his arm across her neck - the sweat leaving a clear stripe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fenelon-Barnes approaches, dismounts from his camel, and addresses Almásy.
</DIRECTION>
<FENELON_BARNES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I recollect your saying to ignore your bones but I assume you have no objection to my rescuing your companion?

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I understand you found some remarkable caves.

A goatskin bag of water is offered to Katharine. She drinks and hands it to Almásy.
</DIRECTION>

ANOTHER WORLD as a honking TAXI containing Almásy and Katharine negotiates the incredible bustle of Cairo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SHEPHEARD'S HOTEL. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Almásy, still in the same clothes, and evidently weary, emerges from the cab, and pulls Katharine's belongings from the trunk, then holds open the door for her. As she walks towards the hotel, he hands her bag to a porter. Katharine is stung.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHARINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you not come in?

</KATHARINE>

<ALMÁSY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I believe you still have my book.

<DIRECTION>
Katharine fishes the book from her knapsack, shoves it at him, then disappears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ALMÁSY'S ROOM. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Almásy lying on a camp bed, face down. The walls are covered with maps, enlargements of photographs. A fan whirs over his kit which is spread, unraveled but ordered, on the stone floor. An ineffably male room, the shutters closed, just the thinnest shaft of light piercing the gloom. Almásy hasn't even removed his clothes, his boots kicked off below his jutting feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's A KNOCK at the door. Almásy sleeps. Another. A third. He's roused from the dead. Stumbles to his feet, opens the door as the knocking continues.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's Katharine. She's bathed, luminous, stands back-lit by the afternoon sun - an angel in a cotton dress. She walks past him into the room. He closes the door. She turns. He KNEELS before her, head at her thighs. She's crying, her face expressionless as her hands go to his head.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHARINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You still have sand in your hair.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHARINE>
<DIRECTION>
She starts to BEAT on his head and shoulders, violently. He pulls back, to look at her, the tears streaming down her face. She kneels and covers his face with kisses. He pulls blindly at her dress and it RIPS across her breasts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATHROOM. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Almásy is in the bath. Katharine, wearing his dressing gown, pours in a jug of steaming water. Almásy leans over the rim of the bath. He's sewing, carefully repairing the torn dress.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHARINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm impressed you can sew.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHARINE>
<ALMÁSY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALMÁSY>
<KATHARINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sew very badly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHARINE>
<ALMÁSY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't sew at all!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALMÁSY>
<KATHARINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A woman should never learn to sew, and if she can she should never admit to it. Close your eyes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHARINE>
<ALMÁSY>
<DIRECTION>
(laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That makes it harder still.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALMÁSY>
<DIRECTION>
She pushes the sewing from his hands, then pours water over his head, then begins to shampoo his hair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Almásy is in heaven. The biggest smile we have seen from him. She continues to massage his scalp.
</DIRECTION>
<ALMÁSY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When were you most happy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALMÁSY>
<KATHARINE>
	<DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. And what do you love? Say everything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALMÁSY>
<KATHARINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do I love? I love rice pudding, and water, the fish in it, hedgehogs! The gardens at our house in Freshwater - all my secret paths.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHARINE>
<DIRECTION>
She rinses his scalp, then slips off the robe and CLIMBS IN BESIDE HIM, covering his neck and shoulders in kisses.
</DIRECTION>
<ALMÁSY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What else?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALMÁSY>
<KATHARINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marmite - addicted! Baths - not with other people! Islands. Your handwriting. I could go on all day.

<KATHARINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A lie. What do you hate most?

</KATHARINE>
<ALMÁSY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ownership. Being owned. When you leave, you should forget me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALMÁSY>
<DIRECTION>
She freezes, pulls herself away, out of the bath, looks at him, then SLAPS HIM VERY HARD across the face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She picks up her dress, the thread and needle dangling from it, and walks, dripping, out of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE PATIENT'S ROOM. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
To the Patient it's as if Katharine is walking out of his wall. He sighs with pain, then looks away to where Hana has fallen asleep on the bed, almost on top of him. He touches her. He speaks as if each word burns him.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_PATIENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could I ask you to move? I'm sorry - but when you turn, the sheets, I can't really bear the sheets moving over me. Sorry.

INT. THE MONASTERY KITCHEN. NIGHT.

Hana comes to the table, carrying a jug of water and a bowl. She's still sad. She unbuttons her dress, pulling it off her shoulder, begins to pour the water to cool herself against the night's pressing heat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. EMERGENCY FIELD HOSPITAL. 1944. LATE DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The EMERGENCY FIELD HOSPITAL is a cluster of tents practically ahead of the Front Line SPORADIC GUN FIRE, LIGHT AND HEAVY, SOUNDS THROUGHOUT. Mary walks by on her way to the Nurse's tent. It's 1944 and the war in Italy is still intense.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EMERGENCY FIELD HOSPITAL TENT. LATE DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAN is washing out of her HELMET, and stands naked in her socks. Hana is using a flannel to wash Jan's back. A couple of other girls like, exhausted, on their cots. The mud is everywhere. Another nurse is making tea out of an adapted plasma can on their tiny primus.
</DIRECTION>

MARY comes in and flops down. She's GIVEN BLOOD and is pale and enervated.

INT. TRIAGE TENT, EMERGENCY FIELD HOSPITAL. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hana walks through the main TRIAGE TENT. It's packed with the ruined bodies of the injured, swaddled in bloody bandages. Hana stops at a couple of beds, shares a word or two with the patients. She stops at another bed, leans over its occupant. His bandaged face is bloated and yellow. He's not breathing. She bends over him, his open eyes fixed in a glassy stare. No pulse. She snaps the triangular cardboard ID from his bed to indicate HE'S DIED. Then tenderly closes his eyes. THEY SUDDENLY SNAP OPEN. HE REARS UP, GRABBING HER.
</DIRECTION>
<WOUNDED_SOLDIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't wait to have me dead? You bitch!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOUNDED_SOLDIER>
<DIRECTION>
He slaps her hand away. Slaps at the tubes going into his arm. Hana is absolutely shocked. But just as suddenly he's sunk back into semi- consciousness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shaken, she sits by him and takes his hand, he pulls it away, she takes it again. He is in terrible pain. His face creased with anger. Now his hand is clutching at hers. She tries to soothe him.
</DIRECTION>
<HANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Try t be calm. Ssssshhh. Come on. Be calm now. Ssshhhh. Be peaceful. It's okay. It's okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANA>
<DIRECTION>
HIS FACE STILLS. HIS HAND LOOSENS. Now he has gone. As Hana inspects him, a shell seems to land close by. THE LIGHTS FLICKER. She ducks, along with everyone else.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Below the bed, on slatboards, above the mud, are the now dead soldier's possessions. They include A PAIR OF TENNIS SHOES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRIAGE TENT, EMERGENCY FIELD HOSPITAL. EVENING.

HANA, WEARING THE TENNIS SHOES, IS GIVING BLOOD. She lies in a cot, next to JAN. The shelling sounds closer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OLIVER, the Doctor, is working on the most recent patient, a young CANADIAN Boy who is critically ill - the tubes hanging above him, of plasma and of blood. The curtain drawn around him is pulled back, to reveal the two nurses in the background. The Soldier can just see them. He's going to die any minute.

A CHRISTMAS PARTY FOR THE TROOPS. The incongruous attempts to create a traditional Christmas in the dusty heat of Cairo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Party is in the courtyard of the Moorish Palace which serves as the private residence of the British Ambassador, SIR RONNIE HAMPTON. Lots of Wives, including LADY HAMPTON and Katharine help serve tea and cake to the SOLDIERS who sit at rudimentary tables with paper plates and paper hats. A man dressed as SANTA CLAUS is giving out presents - PENGUIN PAPERBACKS, CHOCOLATE. Music blares out from a loudspeaker. Officers and Civilians walk the parameter. One of these, arriving, is Almasy. He sits in the shade, catches Katharine's attention. Katharine brings him over a cup of tea and a plate with Christmas cake on it.

<DIRECTION>
A small STOREROOM inside the Palace - Brooms, Mops, Cleaning Equipment. Outside, the party is visible as opaque shadows through the beveled glass of the ornate window. The sound of carols sung by the enlisted men gives way to a version of SILENT NIGHT played on a solitary bagpipe. Inside, ALMÁSY AND KATHARINE MAKE LOVE IN THE DARKNESS. Everything is too fast, desperate, standing up, grabbing, hoisting clothes.

Hana plays. GUN SHOTS punctuates the music. She's totally engrossed and only hears the second or third shot. Her hands falter, she looks up to see A SIKH SOLDIER RUNNING ACROSS THE FIELD WAVING HIS ARMS, his REVOLVER held aloft. He approaches the door, his face creased with anxiety, and raps on the shattered frame. It's KIP.

She gets up and walks past Kip standing at the door, and continues the seven or eight feet to the right and out into the garden VIA THE HOLE RIPPED OUT OF THE WALL.

Hana bends to see what Kip's looking at under the piano. Wires run from the wall to the instrument onto which is taped an EXPLOSIVE CHARGE. If Hana had succeeded in moving the piano she would have triggered the charge. Kip looks at Hana who conceals her dismay with a shrug.

INT. CAB. CAIRO STREET. O/S SHEPHEARD'S HOTEL. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAB DRIVER is asleep. A loud POP! jerks him awake. In the back of the car Geoffrey has opened the champagne. He lets it overflow, then takes a swig. He notices the startled driver and puts up an apologetic arm.
</DIRECTION>
<CLIFTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry.

Two or three CHILDREN knock on the window, begging. Geoffrey knocks back, violently. They disappear.

<DIRECTION>
Almásy and Katharine wander out of his building and into the early morning streets, hand in hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SPICE MARKET. CAIRO. DAWN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MORNING PRAYERS rise out from the city's three Minarets. Almásy stops at a stall, which is just preparing to open for the day. He picks up a SILVER THIMBLE, points at it to the merchant who gives him a price. Without comment, Almásy produces the money and, beaming, hands the thimble to Katharine.
</DIRECTION>
<ALMÁSY>

	That day, had you followed me to the market?

<DIRECTION>
EXT. CAIRO STREET. DAWN.

<DIRECTION>
Katharine takes leave of Almásy on the street corner away from the hotel entrance. They don't kiss, there's no demonstration of feeling. He turns immediately away and disappears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAB. CAIRO STREET. O/S SHEPHEARD'S HOTEL. DAY.

Geoffrey, unshaven, watches as Katharine crosses the street and heads towards the hotel. His expression is terrible, trying to smile, his face collapsed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE PATIENT'S ROOM. MORNING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cheek to Cheek leaks into the room from a GRAMOPHONE that Caravaggio stands over proudly. The Patient opens his eyes - is confused, dislocated - stares blankly at Caravaggio.
</DIRECTION>
<CARAVAGGIO>

(grinning)
</DIRECTION>

Hana comes in, sleepily, frowns at the gramophone.

<HANA>

</HANA>
<CARAVAGGIO>
	<DIALOGUE>

She goes over to the Patient and kisses him gently.
</DIRECTION>
<HANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good morning.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you know that? You're always singing?

</THE_PATIENT>
<HANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kip's another one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANA>
<DIRECTION>
She goes to the window, looks over to where the tents are pitched, sees Hardy shaving, Kip IN THE PROCESS OF WASHING HIS HAIR, his turban HANGING LIKE A RIBBON between two trees to dry. He's perched a bowl on the sundial and is dipping his long coal-black hair into it. As Hana watches Kip, Caravaggio changes the record. The Patient identifies it immediately.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MONASTERY GARDEN. MORNING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hana walks past the tent, and passes Hardy. She's carrying a small cup, which she's a little furtive about. He's carrying a whole armada of OIL LIGHTS. He nods upstairs.
</DIRECTION>
<HANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello.

</HANA>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello miss.

<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very kind of you, we can always eat in the town with the others -

	Since Caravaggio turned up - food seems to appear, so please.

	I'll ask the Lieutenant. But thank you.

<HANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You saved my life. I haven't forgotten.
	</DIALOGUE>

(Hardy waves that away)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you were very very tall. You seemed to big - a Giant - and I felt like a child who can't keep her balance.

(does a little mime)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A toddler
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARDY>
<DIRECTION>
She goes on, and tentatively approaches Kip, who's still working at his hair. Kip hears her and puts out an inquiring arm, moving towards her like a blink man through the curtain of hair. He touches her.
</DIRECTION>
<HANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, is it all right I'm seeing this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANA>
<DIRECTION>
Kip shrugs.
</DIRECTION>
<HANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My hair was long. At some point. I've forgotten what a nuisance it is to wash. You know - if you were ever around - we get water from the pump at noon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANA>
<DIRECTION>
He continues to wash. She holds up the cup of oil.
</DIRECTION>
<HANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Try this. I found a great jar of it. Olive oil. In Naples this was so precious it would have bought you a wife.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANA>
<KIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIP>
<DIRECTION>
She stands for a second, then walks away. Kip examines the oil, calls after her.
</DIRECTION>
<KIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For my hair?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIP>
<HANA>

EXT. THE MONASTERY. HANA'S GARDEN. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HANA IS GARDENING, close to the crucifix, which is now a full-fledged Scarecrow. Broken bottles, fragments of stained glass and shards from a mirror are hung from the crossbar, syringes too, all jangling and tinkling and catching the sunlight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kip and Hardy drive off to work on their motorcycles. She watches them, catching Kip's careless wave to her. She looks briefly at herself in A PIECE OF MIRROR dangling from the Scarecrow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE MONASTERY. UPSTAIRS LANDING. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hana walks along the landing with a tray. There's a message on several doors in the corridor from Kip: SAFE, then a couple with the warning: DANGER. She hears noise from the Patient's room. Listens for a second before going in.

	<DIALOGUE>
	So what do you really object to - the writer or what he's writing about?

	What I really object to, Uncle, is your finishing all my condensed milk.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE MONASTERY CLOISTERS. MORNING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A whoop precedes THE HEADLONG RUSH OF KIP, HARDLY and CARAVAGGIO as they cart the Patient across the Cloisters like manic stretcher- bearers. Hana is with them, holding an umbrella over the Patient who bounces uncomfortably. He is nervous, a little giddy. The rain buckets down.

Madox and Almásy are camped in one corner of THE LIBRARY, hunched over their maps and papers and journals and clashing furiously over the site of the next part of the expedition.
</DIRECTION>
<MADOX>

	<DIALOGUE>
	And I'm telling you there's nothing there to explore.

	<DIALOGUE>
	And here - and here - we could be staring at Zerzura.

Other readers look over at this unseemly skirmish.

	So - on Thursday you don't trust Bell's map - Bell was a fool, Bell couldn't draw a map, but on Friday he's suddenly infallible?

Almásy is surprised by Madox' anger.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The OPEN-AIR CINEMA is just beginning its evening programme.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PATHE NEWS BEGINS and we date the event to April 1939. Stories of imminent war jostle with images of Merrie England. Village greens, sporting victories, Cruft's Dog Show. Alone among the necking couples - mostly soldiers with their Egyptian girlfriends - in an otherwise empty block, is Katharine. She's waiting for Almásy. A SOLDIER comes over to Katharine's row and settles a couple of seats away from her.
</DIRECTION>
<SOLDIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Beggin your pardon, miss, but have you got a lighter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLDIER>
<DIRECTION>
Katharine lights his cigarette and returns to the screen. An item about Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers and TOP HAT. The stars do their stuff. The soldier moves a seat nearer.
</DIRECTION>
<SOLDIER>
<DIRECTION>
(leering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love Ginger, she's a foxy girl, ain't she?

</KATHARINE>
<SOLDIER>

</SOLDIER>
<KATHARINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You heard me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHARINE>
<DIRECTION>
The Soldier slinks off, muttering. Katharine is wretched. She sits head down, not watching the screen, marooned in her despair about duplicity, sordid assignations.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Almásy arrives, slides in beside Katharine, his shadow momentarily large across the screen.
</DIRECTION>
<ALMÁSY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALMÁSY>
<DIRECTION>
They watch the screen. Katharine is weeping. Almásy doesn't understand. He puts his arm around her.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHARINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't do this, I can't do this any more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHARINE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GROPPI PARK. CAIRO. EVENING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A man walks round with A HAND BELL - announcing that the Park is closing. He turns off the gaslights which illuminate the animal cages. Almásy and Katharine sit stiffly on a bench. They don't speak. Almásy puts his hands to his head, he rubs his shoulders. The lights are gradually being extinguished around them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, Katharine gets up.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHARINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd better get back.
	</DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say goodbye here.

<ALMÁSY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not agreeing. Don't think I'm agreeing, because I'm not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALMÁSY>
<DIRECTION>
They stand, awkward. Katharine rehearses her position. The bell clangs.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHARINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just know - any minute he'll find out, we'll barge into somebody we'll - and it will ill him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHARINE>
<ALMÁSY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't go over it again, please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALMÁSY>
<DIRECTION>
He takes her hands, lays his cheeks into them, then releases them, gets up, walks away. She walks towards the gate. He calls after her.
</DIRECTION>
<ALMÁSY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Katharine -
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALMÁSY>
<DIRECTION>
He walks towards her, his smile awful.
</DIRECTION>
<ALMÁSY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just wanted you to know. I'm not missing you yet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALMÁSY>
<DIRECTION>
She nods, can't find this funny.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHARINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You will. You will.

Then she turns sharply from him and catches her head against the gatepost, staggers at the shock of it, then hurries away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE PATIENT'S ROOM. MORNING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hana sits with the English Patient - the room shuttered against the morning light. His breathing is noticeably worsening, a shudder of a breath, the shallow rise and fall of his chest perceptible. Hana frets, touches his wrist, feeling for the pulse.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_PATIENT>
	<DIALOGUE>

Hana goes to the window, opens the shutters. The day pours in.

132A*. EXT. MONASTERY OLIVE GROVES. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hana sees Kip - barely visible - standing at the far perimeter of the garden in the olive groves, HIS HANDS RAISED ABOVE HIM, HIS LEG HELD OUT STRANGELY. WIRES run from his foot in all directions as if he'd trodden in some elaborate steel cobweb.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MONASTERY OLIVE GROVES. DAY.

Hana appears at the edge of the Olive groves and hurries towards Kip, who hasn't moved. He shouts warning her.

	Go to the left! Keep to the left! There are mines and trip wires everywhere!
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Hana stops, hoists up her skirt and circles left, tentative in the long grass. He shouts, doesn't want her close.
</DIRECTION>
<KIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get Hardy. He's on the other side of town. In the hills. Get him to hurry.

	It's okay - I'll help. Please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANA>
<KIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The mines, the wires, there's a trick. Some explode if you stretch the wires, some if you cut them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIP>
<HANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do I do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANA>
<KIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's a mine here, but the others are far enough away, I think at least to give me a chance. I have to work out which one to cut before I fall over.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIP>
<HANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So I follow the wires?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANA>
<KIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You get Hardy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIP>
<HANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I follow the wires.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANA>
<DIRECTION>
She kneels at his feet and tries to trace the tangled route of the web.
</DIRECTION>
<KIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't touch them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIP>
<DIRECTION>
She follows one wire back to the closest mine, and traces another back to Kip's foot. Then she finds another one leading off to a second mine some thirty metres away.
</DIRECTION>
<HANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why would anyone do this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANA>
<KIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've done this. I've had to do this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIP>
<DIRECTION>
Then Hana's suddenly tense.
</DIRECTION>
<HANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give me a second.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANA>
<DIRECTION>
She turns and tiptoes RIGHT THROUGH THE DANGER AREA, straight to what had seized her attention. Kip is appalled.
</DIRECTION>
<KIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing?! Hana!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIP>
<DIRECTION>
Heedless, she dodges another mine and its web of wires just as THE TORTOISE clambers onto a clump of rock, which is, in fact, ANOTHER CONCRETE-COVERED MINE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hana snatches him up as he ambles towards the metal. She turns, holding the protesting animal in triumph. HER FOOT SNAGS ON A WIRE. She has to ease it off, in arabesque, still clutching the tortoise. She goes sideways to the safe zone - setting down the animal. Then she's back with Kip. He's seething. She is strangely elated.
</DIRECTION>
<KIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is this business with you and explosives? Do you think you're immune?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIP>
<HANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I promise you that was the right thing to do. He's my good luck.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she gets the pliers from his belt, and hands them to him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now cut. This one.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she indicates the wire)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope we don't die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANA>
<KIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Get away from here. Quick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIP>
<HANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not scared. So many people have died around me. But I would be a shame for us.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(shrugs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't feel like being shy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANA>
<KIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must get away. Before I cut. I'm not cutting if you're here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIP>
<DIRECTION>
He's struggling. He's going to topple over if he cuts.
</DIRECTION>
<HANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, you can't cut, can you? You'll fall over. Give me the pliers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANA>
<KIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIP>
<DIRECTION>
But he hands them over.
</DIRECTION>
<HANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kiss me. Before I cut. Just in case.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANA>
<KIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't talk. Check again. Lie flat and then cut.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIP>
<DIRECTION>
Hana checks, lies down. He bends as close to the ground as he dares AND KISSES HER, THEN SHE IMMEDIATELY CUTS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE PATIENT'S ROOM. CONTINUOUS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Patient lies in bed. He's agitated by the silence. SUDDENLY THERE'S AN EXPLOSION. He tries to shout, a croak which quickly reduces him to coughing and breathlessness.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_PATIENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hana! Hana! Kip! Hana!
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_PATIENT>
<DIRECTION>
He tries to move. He can't. He's frantic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FOOTSTEPS, as someone hurtles up the stairs. It's Hana. She's ashamed to have forgotten him. She rushes to him.
</DIRECTION>
<HANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. I forgot you'd be worrying. We're all safe. It was a mine, but not the mine. Nobody's hurt. I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANA>
<DIRECTION>
She calms him. He's exhausted. His eyes shine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD. ITALY. LATE DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hana clings onto Kip as the TRIUMPH MOTORCYCLE hares along the circling road. She has her arms around his waist. His head turns to her for a second and she smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROAD BLOCK. TUSCANY. DUSK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kip and Hana have been detained at a ROAD BLOCK. Kip is being questioned at a sentry post, his papers over-thoroughly inspected and accompanied by several meaningful glances at Hana, who waits, standing by the motorcycle. One of the SOLDIERS saunters over and returns her papers.
</DIRECTION>
<SOLDIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you're definitely traveling with him of your own free will?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLDIER>
<HANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANA>
<SOLDIER>
<DIRECTION>
(clearly disapproving)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just wanting to be sure. And he's taking you to church?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLDIER>
<HANA>
<DIRECTION>
(deadpan)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. We're going to a funeral. A cow has died. And in his religion they're sacred.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANA>
<DIRECTION>
The Soldier isn't sure what to make of this. He signals to his companion who returns Kip's papers. Kip walks back to the motorcycles. He says nothing. He kicks the starter. Hana gets on, slides her arms lovingly around him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BRIDGE. ITALY. DUSK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IT'S GETTING DARK. The bike, headlights on, crosses a bridge. Kip has strapped on his crimson emergency light as they sail along the winding crest of mountain ridge that is a spine down Italy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. AREZZO. DUSK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kip steers the motorbike into the deserted PIAZZA.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They dismount and Kip starts to unbuckle his bulging satchel and unload the panniers. Hana still doesn't know what's in store and looks questioningly at Kip as he walks up to the door of the CHURCH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHURCH. DUSK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They enter the Church. It's in almost total darkness. THEN A FLARE SUDDENLY ILLUMINATES THE INTERIOR. It's magnificent. Kip holds the flare, crimson on one arm, green pouring up from the other. Hana walks behind him, still perplexed. There is PROTECTIVE SCAFFOLDING EVERYWHERE, AND SANDBAGS PILED UP HIGH AROUND THE ALTARS, AND THE STATUES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SECOND FLARE. Kip has appeared through A SECRET DOOR high in the church, literally emerging from one of the frescoes which are momentarily visible. He flings a rope over the rafters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now Kip circles Hana with the rope, MAKING A SLING across her waist and shoulder. He lights a smaller flair and hands it to her before disappearing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hana stands holding the flare. She can't see Kip, can only hear him scrambling.
</DIRECTION>
<HANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kip?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANA>
<DIRECTION>
He runs up the sandbags, right up into the rafters. He collects the other end of the rope which is attached to Hana. Holding onto it, he just STEPS OFF INTO THE DARKNESS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SIMULTANEOUSLY HANA IS SWUNG UP INTO THE AIR, her startled yelp echoing around the Church. Kip touches ground, while Hana swings through space, coming to rest about three feet from the FRESCOED WALLS, painted by Piero Della Francesca. Hana's flare makes a halo around her head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now Kip, on the ground, still holding the rope, walks forward and causes Hana to SWING to the right. She lets out a giddy laugh, exhilarated and nervous, and she flies, illuminating - en passant - faces, bodies, angels. Kip guides the rope as if they were making love, which in a way they are.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hana arrives, hovering, in front of THE QUEEN OF SHEBA TALKING TO SOLOMON. She's overwhelmed. She reaches out to touch the giant neck of the sad Queen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kip slowly lets her down, paying out the length of the rope. Hana's face is full of tears. He smiles, holds her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE PATIENT'S ROOM. EVENING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Caravaggio is with the Patient. He sits in the window. Fiddles with the bandages of his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_PATIENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There was a general who wore a patch over a perfectly good eye. The men fought harder for him. Sometimes I think I could get up and dance. What's under your bandages?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_PATIENT>
<DIRECTION>
Caravaggio goes to him, holding out his hands, the bandage ends trailing.
</DIRECTION>
<CARAVAGGIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold the ends.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARAVAGGIO>
<DIRECTION>
The Patient holds them. Caravaggio walks backwards, the bandages unraveling and unraveling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TOBRUK. BRITISH HEADQUARTERS. JUNE 1942. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Caravaggio, thumbs intact and wearing a crumpled linen suit, walks through the mangled corridors of British HQ. Smoke is rising from buildings, the ominous scream of Stuka dive-bombers in the distance as the harbor is pounded, the steady thud of explosions. TOBRUK IS UNDER SIEGE. BHQ is a place in the throws of dismantling itself. SECRETARIES are visiting braziers manned by ARAB BOYS who stoke the fires as boxes of papers are fed into them. ASHES hover in the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BHQ. TOBRUK. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Caravaggio walks through a large room crowded with desks. From one of them, a young woman, AICHA, kisses him, frowning at the chaos and the shelling.
</DIRECTION>
<AICHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's waiting for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AICHA>
<DIRECTION>
Some doors are open, revealing men and women in uniform urgently SHREDDING DOCUMENTS. Caravaggio knocks at an office whose door is ajar and where the incumbent, FENELON-BARNES, is stripping the room of his personal possessions- photographs, stone branches, a cricket bat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FENELON-BARNES OFFICE. BHQ. TOBRUK. DAY.

Caravaggio enters.
</DIRECTION>
<FENELON_BARNES>

	<DIALOGUE>
	What a bloody flap, eh? I heard from Alexandria this morning - apparently no-one there is accepting British pounds. And if you pick up a telephone everybody's practicing their German.

<DIRECTION>
(holds up some gramophone records)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you do - do you take these things?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then, awkward)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Moose, we need you to stay in Tobruk. A bit of a short straw but the thinking is we'll be back - I mean, we will be back - but...and in the interim we need eyes and ears on the ground.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FENELON_BARNES>
<DIRECTION>
A BIG BOMB lands nearby. The building shudders and plaster dust drops from the ceiling. Almost oblivious, the two men head out of the office. Fenelon-Barnes lugs the TRUNK last glimpsed in his tent by Almásy, until Caravaggio takes over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CORRIDOR OF BRITISH HEADQUARTERS. TOBRUK. DAY.

<DIRECTION>
Fenelon-Barnes and Caravaggio make their way down the stairs and to the entrance.

</CARAVAGGIO>
<FENELON_BARNES>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing to pack)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Giving Rommel a bloody nose. That's my suggestion. But did you hear the BBC last nigh? Tobruk is of no strategic importance - makes you wonder.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FENELON_BARNES>
<DIRECTION>
AICHA is at the bottom of the stairs. She falls into step.
</DIRECTION>
<FENELON_BARNES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jerry's got our maps you know. Swines. Before the war we helped them run about the desert making maps - and now they get spies into Cairo using our maps, they'll get Rommel into Cairo using our maps. The whole of the desert like a bus route and we gave it to them. Any foreigner who turned up - welcome to the Royal Geographic, take our maps. Madox went mad, you know - you knew Peter Madox? - after he found out he'd been betrayed by his friend. Absolutely destroyed the poor sod. Shot himself in a church in Dorset.

Caravaggio opens the door, Fenelon-Barnes goes through.

EXT. BRITISH HEADQUARTERS. TOBRUK. DAY.

The Fenelon-Barnes trunk is taken from Caravaggio and joins the pile of luggage and artifacts, which wait to be shipped out.
</DIRECTION>
<FENELON_BARNES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like to get that bastard Almásy - settle the score, eh? That's my fantasy - said he, clearing out. Must have been a spy all along.

A GERMAN TROOP CARRIER rumbles forward passing a line of BEDRAGGLED BRITISH POWS as they're marched along the side of harbor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TOBRUK RUINED QUARTER. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HILL OF SALVAGED ARMY BOOTS is being explored by a couple of GERMAN SOLDIERS in search of better footwear. Below them the POWS trudge by, one of them barefoot. ONE OF THE GERMANS tosses down a pair of boots then continues his own perusal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TOBRUK SQUARE. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A crowd of Tobruk CIVILIANS - French and Italians among the MOSTLY ARAB FACES. Their papers are being thoroughly checked by officers sitting at open desks. IN A LINE, WEARING HIS SHABBY SUIT, IS CARAVAGGIO. AN ARAB WOMAN in front of him is arguing over the identity of her ominously CAUCASIAN-LOOKING CHILD. An INTERPRETER mediates. The OFFICER doesn't believe the woman. She's getting frantic at the possibility of losing her child.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly there's a disturbance as a WOMAN is dragged along the line by her hair. She's bloodied, and has been tortured, and it's hard to recognize her as the pretty AICHA. She touches a couple of people in the line. They're horrified. Soldiers pull them away. Caravaggio doesn't look, stares straight ahead. An officer watches him AS HE TURNS BRIEFLY AND HELPLESSLY OUT OF CONCERN FOR HER. THEIR EYES CATCH FOR AN INSTANT AND THE OFFICER SEES IT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CARAVAGGIO RUNS, bolts for cover, vaulting the rubble which blocks one corner of the square. The CONGREGATION throws itself to the ground until the square has only standing soldiers and a running man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TOBRUK. INTERIOR OF RUINED BUILDING. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shots pursue Caravaggio as he disappears behind the rubble, then bobs up again as he darts inside a blasted building. He clambers up some ruined stairs, heaves over the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TOBRUK. FACADE OF RUINED BUILDING. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CARAVAGGIO grabs a metal bar on the facade of the building, from which he hangs, looking for the next foothold. Soldiers appear along the top of the building, shouting, rifles ready. AN OFFICER arrives and stops the soldiers firing, and the others begin to laugh as Caravaggio hangs from the bar fifteen feet above a balcony, slowly losing his strength. Another SOLDIER waits for him in the balcony below. Now he starts to laugh. Caravaggio hangs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM. TOBRUK. NOVEMBER 13,1942. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Caravaggio is slumped at a table, HIS HANDS MANACLED TO ITS THICK WOODEN LEGS. There's A TELEPHONE at another table in the corner of the room attended by a CLERK with A STENOGRAPHER working next to him. The room has stone walls which appear damp, and no windows. SOLDIERS stand guard at the door. It's a horrible room. Caravaggio is trying to sleep, he's unshaven, and pasty-looking. His interrogator, Müller, seems incredibly tired and aggravated. He's on the phone.

Müller doesn't even pay attention, he's going through a file. Pulls out some photographs, starts spreading them out.

You're married and you were fucking another woman, so that's - is it the hands that are cut off? Or is that for stealing? Does anyone know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MÜLLER>

There's silence. Müller turns to Caravaggio.

Now the phone starts again. The CLERK picks it up, there's a terse exchange, he puts the receiver on the desk, waits for the moment to interrupt Müller.
</DIRECTION>
<MÜLLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ten fingers. How about this? You give me a name for every finger - doesn't matter who. I get something, you keep something. I'm trying to be reasonable. Fenelon-Barnes, we could call that two names.

Müller walks over, takes the receiver and slams it down. an AIR RAID SIREN is going off somewhere, and now the faint sound of explosions is also discernible, but all muffled in this room with the steady clack- clack of the STENOGRAPHER. At that moment, Müller suddenly becomes aware of what is happening. He turns on the Stenographer.

	You can't do that! Hey - come on!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARAVAGGIO>
<DIRECTION>
DURING THIS Müller's gone to the table, pulled out a drawer and produced A CUT-THROAT RAZOR. He hands it to the nurse, makes a line across his own left thumb and jerks his head towards Caravaggio. The nurse is extremely reluctant. Müller claps his hands, pushes her towards Caravaggio.

<MÜLLER>

<DIRECTION>
The nurse, horrified, shakes her head. Müller snatches the razor from her and heads towards the prostate Caravaggio.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One Guard has got to his feet and grips Caravaggio around the neck in half-nelson, others holding his legs, while Müller approaches. Caravaggio can't move. He's gurgling as the Guard almost strangles him. His eyes are streaming with tears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now Müller is at his other hand, and the ROAR of pain again lifts Caravaggio to his feet, THE WHOLE TABLE RISING IN THE AIR, his mutilated hands slipping from the handcuffs lie Houdini, the drawers of the table SPILLING their contents everywhere, before he sinks to his knees like a gored bull and BLACKS OUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM. TOBRUK. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LATER, and Caravaggio comes round. His eyes open and then his face spasms with pain. He looks down at his ruined hands, then realizes he's alone on the floor of the room, the papers still scattered, the table on its side. He gets up and staggers out of the open door and up the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STAIRS FROM INTERROGATION ROOM. TOBRUK. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The corridor is deserted, but the body of a GERMAN SOLDIER sprawls on the stairs leading up to daylight. Outside Caravaggio can hear fighting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROOF. INTERROGATION BUILDING. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Caravaggio walks unsteadily along the roof of the building. Grey and yellow gusts of smoke and the rat-ta-tat-tat of machine gun fire accompany him, and there's the sound of vehicles screeching and people shouting nearby, but no visual clues as to what's happening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUDDENLY A PARACHUTE FLOATS DOWN BY HIM. THEN ANOTHER. THEN ANOTHER. HE'S SURROUNDED BY PARACHUTES. THE BRITISH ARE RECLAIMING TOBRUK. A PARATROOPER LANDS ON THE ROOF, AND GESTURES TO CARAVAGGIO TO RAISE HIS HANDS. HE SLOWLY DOES SO.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE PATIENT'S ROOM. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Caravaggio stands in front of the bed, holding up his NAKED HANDS to the Patient, like a man surrendering - two flaps like gills where his thumbs were. The Patient reaches out to take his hands and gently lowers them. Caravaggio finds his bandages, start to wrap them back round his fists.
</DIRECTION>
<CARAVAGGIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The man who took my thumbs, I found him eventually - he's dead. The man who took my photograph, I found him too - that took me a year. He's dead. Another man took that man across the desert to Cairo. Now I intend to find him.

INT. AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE. CAIRO, 1939. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Last seen at the Troops Christmas party, the INNER COURTYARD has been transformed into an elegant outdoor banquet, with band. The Almásy/Madox team is assembled for A FAREWELL DINNER. They are waiting for Almásy to arrive, his seat conspicuously empty. He is very late. And then he's there, dangerous drunk, terribly dashing. He practically dances to his chair, which he drags violently away from its position opposite Katharine. He bows to Lady Hampton.

Later, now MOST OF THE GROUP ARE DANCING. We see Katharine dancing with Rupert Douglas, enjoying herself. Bermann is there and even Madox jogging and grinning foolishly. Clifton looks at Katharine who, as the dance ends, excuses herself to go to the cloakroom. Almásy hovers in the shadows, unseen.
</DIRECTION>

Katharine comes along the familiar warren of rooms and corridors and is suddenly confronted by Almásy, tortured and out of control.

<DIRECTION>
INT. THE MONASTERY, LANDING AND STAIRS. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hana leaves the room, then turns and sees A TINY LAMP on the floor, it's made from a SNAIL SHELL and oil. She bends to it curiously, then sees a second lamp half-way down the stairs, then a third further down. She smiles in the light, then follows the trail.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE MONASTERY CLOISTERS. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the Cloisters THE TRAIL OF SHELL LAMPS CONTINUES, like tiny cat's eyes. As they reach the hopscotch chalk marks, they outline the squares. Hana HOPSCOTCHES and then follows the light, disappearing round a corner.
</DIRECTION>

INT. THE MONASTERY STABLES. NIGHT.

Hana comes through into the stables. The lamps lead her, then they stop. She peers into the shadows.

Kip hurries to his tent. Hana follows him.

And he's ready, Hardy having wheeled out their motorcycles. He gets on his, and they're away, Hana hardly able to look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. A VIADUCT NORTH OF THE MONASTERY. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KIP IS LOWERED BY A PULLEY INTO THE SHAFT THE SAPPERS HAVE MADE AROUND THE BOMB. Hardy supervises. The bombs huge - 2, 000 lbs, and protrudes ostrich-like from the pit, its nose sunk into a pool of sludge at the base of the viaduct.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kip steps off and sinks knee deep in mud, grunting in disgust. Warily, he touches his huge opponent, feeling the condition of the case. He wipes the metal. Reveals a serial number, calls it out to Hardy, who's perched on the bank.
</DIRECTION>
<KIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Serial number - KK-1P2600.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIP>
<DIRECTION>
He's hypnotized by the number: KK-1P: a bomb with his name on it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROAD APPROACHING VIADUCT. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hana cycles along on Caravaggio's bicycle. A TANK comes roaring up behind her, then a second and a third, loaded up with people, citizens and soldiers, and children, waving flags and gesticulating. She lets the metal circus go by.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BOMB SHAFT. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Back in the shaft, Kip works away, his fingers shaking with the cold from the oxygen he's using to freeze the fuse. Suddenly there's a VIOLENT TREMOR. The ground is SHUDDERING, and the bomb slips horribly. Kip GRABS AT IT helplessly as if trying to stop a man from falling, instead it falls on him pushing him into the sludge.
</DIRECTION>
<KIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hardy! Hardy! What's happening?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIP>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. VIADUCT. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The TANKS are rumbling towards the Viaduct. HORNS start sounding. HARDY, below, bellows at his men above for explanation.

<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Corporal!? Dade!!

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is this - a bloody carnival? Stop them!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARDY>
<DIRECTION>
Three Sappers run across the bridge towards the oncoming procession. They wave their orange flags, the tanks wave back wit their flags - Stars and Stripes, Union Jacks. Now SHOTS are ringing out. In the shaft, oblivious, Kip slides out from under the bomb, the oxygen spurting everywhere, all over his clothes, hissing on the surface of the water. Hardy bends into the shaft, heedless of his own safety.
</DIRECTION>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've got to cut, sir, that frost won't last.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARDY>
<KIP>

</KIP>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yessir.

</HARDY>
<KIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is making me incredibly angry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIP>
<DIRECTION>
He rubs his hands to warm them up, locates his needle pliers and slips them through the tiny gap. His hand touches the casing and the freeze BURNS his hand. He jerks back, DROPPING THE PLIERS into the sludge, cursing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now he's on his hands and knees in the sludge, trying frantically to find the pliers. Hardy looks at his watch, he can't help. The seconds run out as Kip grovels in the mud. Totally submerged, he suddenly comes out with the pliers, goes straight to the fuse, no finesse, and cuts. There's a snip. Then nothing. Then Kip laughs at Hardy.
</DIRECTION>
<KIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kiss me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIP>
<DIRECTION>
Hardy is already at the winch, hauling it up. Kip can hardly clip on the halter - his hands numb and burned. As the pulley jerks he just clings on, rising from the grip of the mud like an ancient corpse out of a bog.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The other sappers have gathered around the edge of the site. Great elation on their faces.
</DIRECTION>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get a blanket!

<DIRECTION>
Kip shakes his hand. Kip shakes Hardy's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<KIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Congratulations.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIP>
<DIRECTION>
And now they're all shaking hands, and slapping backs and the SOLDIERS FROM THE TANKS are there and the victory celebrations begin. Kip's blank, drained, not taking anything in, as Dade wraps a blanket around his shoulders.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HANA'S ON TOP OF THE VIADUCT, watching as Kip is wrapped in his blanket, the men celebrating. She shouts with relief from the top of the bridge.

The gramophone plays Frank Sinatra. Kip sits in the window, the shutters open, the village lit up behind his head, nodding to the music, sucking out of his condensed milk. Elsewhere there is an open bottle of cognac, some wine. The Patient has a beaker of wine. Caravaggio is dancing with Hana.

EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A tiny PIAZZA where the Sappers and the Villagers are having their own, more raucous, Victory Feste. There are accordions, there's dancing, and there's HARDY, stripped to some exotic underpants, a large tattoo: DORIS inside a heart, clambering up the EQUESTRIAN STATUE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FOUNTAIN. He's astride the horse and now straining to get up to the tip of the outstretched sword, so that he can hang the UNION JACK FLAG he has in his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLACKLER, one of the Sappers, is Hardy's assistant. He's drunk and slips from his ladder, falling flat on his back into the fountain with a great splash, to much hilarity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE PATIENT'S ROOM. NIGHT.

<DIRECTION>
Kip's motorbike skids into the tiny PIAZZA.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MILITARY AMBULANCE IS ALREADY THERE. Dade and SPALDING are presiding as the paramedics take two bodies into the rear of the truck. The shattered fountain, the sluiced flagstones, shining wet and slick, give some clues as to what's happened, as do the elderly standing in the shadows, the distressed girls, arm in arm. ONE GIRL, young and quite striking, is particularly inconsolable, her grief sobbed out at the doors of the ambulance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SPALDING salutes Kip, who waves his salute away, just wanting to know what happened.
</DIRECTION>
<SPALDING>

Kip has pulled out all of Hardy's gear. Now he starts on the tent. Hana comes out into the step. Kip turns, his eyes brimming, sees her, sighs, then turns back and kicks at the pegs, collapsing the tent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now he's trying to fold a shirt. Hana takes it from him. She folds it. Then together they start to fold the tent, Kip orchestrating, not wanting to talk. Finally, Kip looks at Hana, stiff with emotion.
</DIRECTION>
<KIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was thinking yesterday - yesterday! - the Patient, Hardy: they're everything that's good about England. I couldn't even say what that was. We didn't exchange two personal words, and we've been together through some terrible things, some -

The Expedition Team is packing up the Basecamp. Madox and Almásy are loading things into the plane. FOUAD, AL AUF and others work at the cars.
</DIRECTION>
<MADOX>

	Had a letter from my wife. The wisteria is still out, which I'm looking forward to. She says Dorset is gripped with Invasion Fever. Wrong coast I should have thought, still...

</ALMÁSY>
<MADOX>

</MADOX>
<DIRECTION>
Madox kneels and takes A HANDFUL OF SAND, puts it into his pocket. He throws his haversack into the plane then turns. Almásy puts out a hand. This is a moment of great emotional weight for them both, conducted as if nothing were happening.
</DIRECTION>
<MADOX>

Madox clambers into his plane, then remembers something, jabs at his throat.

Almásy nods, goes to the propeller.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Almásy sits on a ridge transferring map of information from his Herodotus onto a sheet of paper. He looks up at the sound of Clifton's approaching Steerman. He folds up the map and sticks it inside one of Clifton's CHAMPAGNE BOTTLES and lodges it between the rocks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STEERMAN. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clifton is flying the STEERMAN up to Gilf Kebir. From the air it's possible to make out Almásy scrambling down from the ridge towards where the stones indicate a landing area, carrying the last of the materials from the Cave of Swimmers. Almásy waves in recognition and welcome.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BASECAMP AT THE CAVE OF SWIMMERS. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Almásy watches as the plane drops towards him, shielding his eyes against the sun. the plane bounces along the runway, not quite landing. Almásy continues packing the equipment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Almásy looks up to see the plane swerve, now suddenly HEADING STRAIGHT TOWARDS HIM. He's completely vulnerable, nowhere to run. He dives at the ground. THE PLANE SMASHES AGAINST AN INVISIBLE RIDGE AND TURNS OVER AND OVER, the wings snapping off like twigs as it hurtles past the prostrate Almásy. He gets to his feet and starts to run towards the wreckage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A blue line of smoke is uncoiling from the plane, but no fire. Almásy pulls away the debris to find GEOFFREY - SLUMPED, NECK BROKEN, BLOODY. He tries to move him, and in the process reveals, to his ABSOLUTE horror, KATHARINE, STARING GRIMLY AHEAD, UNABLE TO MOVE. He's frantic.
</DIRECTION>
<ALMÁSY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Katharine! Oh dear God, Katharine - what are you doing here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALMÁSY>
<KATHARINE>
<DIRECTION>
(eyes rolling, an incredible weariness)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't move. I can't get out.

</KATHARINE>
<DIRECTION>
Almásy starts to pull at the wreck around her. DURING THIS -
</DIRECTION>
<ALMÁSY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why did he bring you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALMÁSY>
<KATHARINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A surprise, he said.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHARINE>
<DIRECTION>
Almásy inspects Clifton, tries to find a pulse. The smoke circles around them. Katharine looks at her husband.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHARINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Poor Geoffrey. He knew. He must have known all the time. He was shouting - I love you, Katharine, I love you so much. Is he badly hurt? His neck is odd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHARINE>
<DIRECTION>
Almásy puts his arm around Katharine to try and pull her clear. She can't stand the pain.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHARINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please don't move me. It hurts too much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHARINE>
<ALMÁSY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've got to get you out of here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALMÁSY>

(can't bear to hurt her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know, darling, I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALMÁSY>
<DIRECTION>
The smoke thickens. He pulls - hard - the pain from which causes Katharine to gasp, then pass out. They slip haphazardly to the ground, cushioned a little by the sand. He lifts her gently into his arms and carries her from the danger of the place, then turns and runs back. THE PLANE SUDDENLY ERUPTS IN FLAMES. Almásy dashes into the fire, disappearing into the smoke before emerging with Clifton over his shoulder, fireman's-lift style.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE CAVE OF SWIMMERS. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He has WRAPPED KATHARINE IN THE SILK FOLDS OF HER PARACHUTE and emerges from the near the familiar cleft in the rock, struggling with the exertion of the climb as they approach the Cave of Swimmers. He has a large water bottle slung around his neck and a haversack, and is loaded like a pack horse. Katharine opens her eyes.
</DIRECTION>

They stagger on. He suddenly notices a stain of gold at her neck. It's saffron, leaking from a silver THIMBLE which hangs from a black ribbon.
</DIRECTION>
<ALMÁSY>
<DIRECTION>
(overwhelmed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're wearing the thimble.

	Of course. You idiot. I always wear it. I've always worn it. I've always loved you.

Almásy CRIES as he walks - huge sobs, no words - convulsed with the pain of it. They approach the Cave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAVE OF SWIMMERS. DAY.

Almásy comes through in shadows, carrying Katharine, blocking out the light that pours into the entrance of the cave. Once inside, he sets her down incredibly gently, makes a bed of blankets and the parachute. He turns on his flashlight.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen to me, Katharine. You've broken your ankle and I'm going to have to try and bind it. I think your wrist might be broken, too - and some ribs, which is why it's hurting you to breathe. I'm going to have to walk to El Taj. Given all the traffic in the desert these days I should bump into one army or another before I reach there - or Fenelon-Barnes and his camel. And then I'll be back and we'll be fine, and I'll never leave you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALMÁSY>
<DIRECTION>
The fire is lit and he comes over to her, kneels beside her.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHARINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you promise? I wouldn't want to die here. I wouldn't want to die in the desert. I've always had a rather elaborate funeral in mind, with particular hymns. Very English. And I know exactly where I want to be buried. In our garden. Where I grew up. With a view of the sea. So promise me you'll come back for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHARINE>
<ALMÁSY>

INT. CAVE OF SWIMMERS. TORCHLIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Katharine has been writing in the Herodotus. The torchlight FLICKERS. She shakes the torch. It FLICKERS again. Then goes out. Absolute BLACKNESS. The sound of her trembling breath.

A TRAIN scuttles through the desert.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE TRAIN. THE DESERT. DUSK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Almásy is HANDCUFFED to the metal grille of the goods compartment. He's lying down amongst a bunch of other prisoners and their little bundles of possessions in this makeshift cell - some Arabs, some Italians.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SERGEANT pushes a lavatory-bound prisoner along the corridor, leaving behind A YOUNG PRIVATE who sits on a packing case, with a rifle across his lap, reading a Penguin edition of Gulliver's Travels. Almásy is in complete despair to be on the train. He tries to move, but he's locked tight to the grille. He rattles the cuffs against the metal.
</DIRECTION>
<ALMÁSY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me.

</SERGEANT>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE TRAIN CORRIDOR. THE DESERT. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Soldier pushes Almásy along the corridor. They arrive outside the lavatory. The Soldier is distracted for a split second. Enough for Almásy to ELBOW HIM savagely in the stomach, winding him, then he KICKS HIM REPEATEDLY in the head. He wraps his cuffs around the Soldier's neck and - yanking them together and twisting - produces a tiny, efficient and sickening snap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He finds the KEY to the handcuffs, unlocks them, grabs the soldier and drags him into the empty lavatory.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRAIN. THE DESERT. EVENING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Almásy arrives at the rear of the train, passes the Kitchen carriage, where Arabs sweat over the boiler. He pulls open the back door only to surprise a GUARD, who's lolling casually, enjoying the sunset. Almásy SHOOTS HIM with his stole rifle. He clambers over the guard rail and leaps off the train - tumbling into the desert sunset.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RAILWAY TRACK. THE DESERT. EVENING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Almásy, silhouetted against the evening sky, walks back down the track, THREE HUNDRED MILES AWAY from the dying Katharine Clifton, no way now of saving her. He is a tiny speck in the vast desert. His heart broken. He sinks to his knees in despair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE PATIENT'S ROOM. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Patient is exhausted. He has said aloud what has tortured him. His failure to save Katharine. He looks at Caravaggio.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_PATIENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So yes. She died because of me. Because I loved her. Because I had the wrong name.

INT. THE MONASTERY STABLES. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kip is working at a BLACKSMITH'S FORGE in the Stables. He is heating pieces of metal. He has arranged his material on a bench - a bayonet, a rifle, a piece of bomb casting.
</DIRECTION>

Hana enters, goes up, hugs him from behind.

	That gun at Lahor, Kipling's cannon - Zamzammah - remember? That was made out of the metal of ordinary things. I want to make an ordinary thing out of guns.

</KIP>
<DIRECTION>
His bayonet is thrust into the forge. It's red hot.
</DIRECTION>
<KIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When I went to England I was amazed at what went on, the waste - I'd been taught to re-use everything, the dung from a cow to cool a radiator, a fork to fix a typewriter - India could live for a hundred years on what I saw thrown away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIP>
<HANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I should go to the house, get breakfast.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANA>
<KIP>

Caravagio is injecting the Patient with morphine.

	And did you never see Katharine? You never got back to the Cave?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARAVAGGIO>
<THE_PATIENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I got back there finally to keep my promise. To come back for her. And then of course I couldn't... I couldn't even do that properly.

</THE_PATIENT>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE MONASTERY STABLES. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kip hammers the metal into its new shape. He stops, distracted by something he's listening to on his crystal set. It's new he seems not to fully understand, about a bomb dropping on Japan. A NEW KIND OF BOMB.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE METAL GLOWS A VIVID RED ON THE ANVIL. Suddenly Kip slops it into the trough of water, sending a great hissing column of steam.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE PATIENT'S ROOM. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Caravaggio sits by the Patient.
</DIRECTION>
<CARAVAGGIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You get to the morning and the poison leaks away, doesn't it? Black nights, fucking black nights, when you want to howl like a dog. I thought I would kill you. You killed my friends, you ruined my hands. But the girl was always here, like some Guardian Angel.
	</DIALOGUE>

<THE_PATIENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't kill me. I died years ago.

<CARAVAGGIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, now I can't kill you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARAVAGGIO>
<DIRECTION>
Kip storms into the room, walks straight up to the Patient and POINTS A GUN AT HIM. Caravaggio is taken by surprise.
</DIRECTION>
<CARAVAGGIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kip - what are - ?

</CARAVAGGIO>
<KIP>

	What are you talking about?
	</DIALOGUE>

<KIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What have I been doing all this time? Do you know how many mines I've seen? - more mines than there are soldiers, more - how many mines we've put in the ground ourselves, stuffed in corpses, dropped out of the sky. And now this.

He approaches the bed. Caravaggio tries to intervene.
</DIRECTION>
<CARAVAGGIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kip, listen -

<DIRECTION>
Kip sings the rifle at him, KNOCKING HIM to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<KIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said keep out of this!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIP>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls of his earphones and rams them around the Patient's head, dropping the set onto the bed. The Patient listens, coughing.
</DIRECTION>
<KIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you hear? Can you hear what they're celebrating? I listened to you, Uncle. Sitting at your feet - always sitting at somebody's feet - trying to learn. The right way to hold a teacup, otherwise you're out, the pukkah knot in your tie - as if everything can be explained in terms of a cricket bat and an accent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIP>
<CARAVAGGIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kip -

Hana runs in, alerted by the commotion, stunned by what she sees.

	Well, then ask him his name!

	</DIALOGUE>
</HANA>
<KIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're excited! They're happy about destroying a whole city. Would they do that to a White Man's City? Never!

	<DIALOGUE>
	Kip, listen, he lost everything because he wasn't English - Jesus! - shoot me, I'm more English than he is!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARAVAGGIO>
<DIRECTION>
Kip levels the gun at the Patient. Then breaks it open, throws it down on the bed, next to the earphones, from which the news continues to leak, some words audible - Eunola Gay... Hiroshima... and from different voices - It was beautiful! just beautiful! Bang! the biggest bang you ever saw!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. KIP'S TENT. LATE DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hana approaches. Kip is inside the tent, the flap zipped. She sees his shadow move, then freeze as she calls his name. It's like a confessional. The flap between them, the man in shadows, Hana crouched, forlorn.
</DIRECTION>
<HANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kip. Kip. It's me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(no response)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why? It's another bomb. However big, what's the difference? There've been so many bombs. What about Coventry? What about Dresden? Where were those cities?

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't understand. Let me come in.

</HANA>
<DIRECTION>
The shadow doesn't move. Hana is at a loss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE PATIENT'S ROOM. EVENING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Patient becomes aware of something in the room, opens his eyes, squints into the darkness and sees A FIGURE hovering against the wall. He's in the Cave, he thinks, he's seeing the painted figures moving, he's seeing the Swimmer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KIP - bare chested, no turban, hair loose - stands in the shadows at the foot of the Patient's bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HANA'S ROOM. EVENING.

<DIRECTION>
Kip comes into the room. Hana sits in the corner. She is nervous of him, his look, his intensity.
</DIRECTION>
<KIP>

</KIP>
<HANA>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that what you think? Is that what you think I think?

</HANA>
<KIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's what I've learned.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIP>
<HANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm thinking about your heart, not your skin. And how to reach it. And that I don't think I can. A bomb has ruined us, just not the bomb I thought would ruin us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANA>
<DIRECTION>
She stands, goes to him.
</DIRECTION>
<HANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've clung to you. I've clung to you. Kip. Life a raft.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE MONASTERY. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Next morning and Kip has attached what he was making in the forge - A NEW HANDLE - to the pump. Now he works it, producing a steady stream of water. His motorbike is against the wall. He goes to it. Caravaggio is watching. He hugs Kip, wrapping his arms around the boy like a bear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HANA'S VEGETABLE GARDEN. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HANA stands by her Vegetable Garden. Kip stops the motorbike. She goes to him, stands, FASTENS THE TOP BUTTON of his coat. You feel she might jump on the seat behind him. But she doesn't.
</DIRECTION>
<HANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll always go back to that church. Look at my painting.

He nods, winds up the throttle, and is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE PATIENT'S ROOM. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hana comes in carrying FLOWERS and sets them down on the table next to a clutch of MORPHINE AMPOULES. She picks up the hypodermic to prepare his injection. She takes a phial. THE PATIENT REACHES OUT AND PUSHES TWO MORE TOWARDS HER. THEIR EYES MEET, THEN HE SHOVELS ANOTHER, THEN ALL OF THEM. She looks at him. IT'S A MASSIVE, LETHAL DOSE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hana starts to prepare the injection, her eyes filling with tears. The Patient nods, smiles, whispers.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_PATIENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you. Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_PATIENT>
<DIRECTION>
She kisses him, gently on the mouth. He closes his eyes.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAVE OF SWIMMERS. TORCHLIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A flashlight flickers in the cave. ALMÁSY APPEARS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KATHARINE'S CORPSE lies where he left her - a ghost on a bed of silk and blankets. The chill of the cave has preserved her. She could be asleep. She clutches the Herodotus.
</DIRECTION>
<ALMÁSY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Katharine, my darling.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALMÁSY>
<DIRECTION>
He sobs, whispering to her. He's terribly cold, exhausted. He slips underneath the covers to be next to her, and closes his eyes.

	I'm so tired.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALMÁSY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE PATIENT'S ROOM. DAY.

<HANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My darling, I'm waiting for you - how long is a day in the dark, or a week?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANA>

The Patient looks across AND WHAT HE SEES IS KATHARINE BESIDE HIM IN THE BED, SMILING, STROKING HIS HEAD, SPEAKING TO HIM.
</DIRECTION>

	...the fire is gone now, and I'm horribly cold. I really ought to drag myself outside but then there would be the sun...

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BED IS EMPTY, THE MATTRESS STRIPPED. Hana stands in the doorway, then sees THE HERODOTUS on the bedside table.

She picks it up, goes to the page of Katharine's letter, continues to read.

Caravaggio is at the gate to the Monastery. The TRUCK we saw before is waiting with him. The PARTISAN with his head bandana and shotgun remains the same, but now there are CHILDREN in the back and a WOMAN sits behind the man, nursing a two-year-old.
</DIRECTION>
<CARAVAGGIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hana! Come on!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARAVAGGIO>
<DIRECTION>
He gets up into the BALUSTRADE, tentatively finds his balance, then starts to walk, heel to toe - slowly, and then with more confidence - along the long thin line of stone. The children watch intently. He turns and bows.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHARINE>
<DIRECTION>

EXT. THE MONASTERY CLOISTERS. DAY.

Hana walks across the cloisters, passing the chalked hopscotch squares, leaving it all behind. Then she stops, bends, retrieves A SNAIL SHELL, keeps going. KATHARINE'S VOICE CONTINUES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE CAVE OF SWIMMERS. TORCHLIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALMÁSY SMUDGES KATHARINE'S PALE FACE WITH COLOR. OCHRE across her brow, BLUE on her eyelids, RED on her lips. He presses his cheek to hers, smoothes her hair.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHARINE>

EXT. THE LANE OUTSIDE MONASTERY GARDEN. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KATHARINE'S VOICE CONTINUES. Hana comes out to the truck, carrying her small bundle. Caravaggio effects some introduction, beginning with the woman driver, Gioia. She and Caravaggio smile like lovers.
</DIRECTION>
<CARAVAGGIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hana - this is Gioia.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARAVAGGIO>

Gioia smiles, shakes her hand. Then Hana meets the others - Gioia's brother and wife, their children. She smiles at them.

	I can get in the back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANA>
<DIRECTION>
And she clambers up, sits down between the children. They exchange some small stiff, shy smiles, and then the truck bounces away. Hana takes one final look at the Monastery as it disappears around the bend and then turns and confronts the life insisting noisily in the truck.

INSIDE THE COCKPIT: THE COUPLE AS AT THE FRONT OF THE FILM. Almásy obliterated by goggles and helmet. Katharine behind him, slumped forwards as if sleeping.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Almásy banks across the plateau of the Gilf Kebir and glances down. In a ravine is a sudden OASIS OF WHITE ACACIAS. He is mesmerized.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then it's gone and he passes into the earth without maps - the desert - as it stretches out for mile after mile.

Almásy, the English Patient, begins to sing - Szerelem, Szerelem - until that also fades and is replaced by the woman's tender lament heard at the beginning of the film, singing for all that has been lost.
