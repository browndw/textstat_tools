EXT. WINGS BAKERY SHOP, WEST BROADWAY, CHINATOWN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUSTOMERS move in and out when BOOOOM! The screen EXPLODES in a ball of FIRE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bleeding PATRONS stumble into the street as flames pour from a gaping hole that was once a bustling Herb shop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across the street, a young ASIAN, poorly dressed, lights a smoke. His body is undernourished and covered with the tattoo insignia of the FUKIENESE DRAGONS. But it's his eyes that get your attention. Dark and hungry, they watch his day's work with the detachment of one who's been taught the value of life is zero. Meet BOBBY VU.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Oblivious to the chaos, he strides into the street flanked by three similarly tattooed youths who we will come to know as JACK, BLACK EYES and "THE TALL KID". Together they encircle a middle-aged TRIAD SYMPATHIZER dressed totally in his bakery whites, crawling from the rubble. The young gangsters brazenly pull pistols from their jackets.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
The injured man futilely pulls a gun from his coat as the Dragons execute their prey in a barrage of gunfire. Smoke drifts from their weapons when Bobby notices a frightened TOURIST lying in a puddle of her own blood. He looks into her tear filled eyes and raises his gun to finish her. But she dies before he needs to shoot.

He then climbs into a rented Ford and takes off.

	The tragic death of BETH KADELL from Fairlawn New Jersey in this morning's Chinatown bombing has mobilized the city and drawn attention to a six month war being waged in the back alleys and underground corridors of the city's most mysterious neighborhood. According to police, the Fukienese Dragons, a new entity in the Chinatown crime scene, are headed by twenty year old Bobby Vu from the Fukien province of China.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REPORTER>
<DIRECTION>
The television shows a surveillance photo of Bobby Vu as the sound of sporadic GRUNTS and a heavy WHACK...WHACK, emanates from the back of the shop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sitting at a table, drowning in a shower of sweat, is a fifty year old blob named PHAN HO. Nerves mask his face, when suddenly his arm lurches forward as if something or someone pulled him. WHACK!
</DIRECTION>

(TELEVISION)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sources say the bombing and execution of a known Triad Soldier are another chapter in the power struggle between the Fukienese Dragons Youth Gang and the Triad run Tung Fung Benevolent Association, Chinatown's ruling organized crime entity for over a century, believed to be headed by local businessman Benjamin Wong. Known in the community as Uncle Benny.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REPORTER>
<DIRECTION>
A photo of sixty three year old Benny Wong fills the TV screen as Phan Ho takes a five from a dwindling stack of bills and pushes it across the table to NICK CHEN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chen's thirty six, and whatever money he earns is spent on clothes and fifty dollar haircuts. He's handsome and cool, with looks hailing more from his Hong Kong father than his mainland mom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Phan watches as Chen takes a card from his hand and flips it onto the table. Ace of Spades. Phan drops a three of Clubs. Back and forth until Phan's empty and Chen's left with one card. He smiles, taking his time as the fat man wipes sweat from his brow.
</DIRECTION>
<PHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Throw it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHAN>
<DIRECTION>
Phan's poised to strike. Chen drops the card. Jack of Clubs. Both men move, but Chen's quicker. He pulls the card from the table letting Phan slam his hand on nothing but wood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHACK!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Phan holds his palm as Chen picks up the cards and another five. He shuffles the deck skillfully with his right hand as his left fishes a smoke from his pocket.
</DIRECTION>

INT PHAN HO'S LAMPS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

The youths entering the shop are FUKIENESE. Two, Jack and "The Tall Kid", we recognize as the shooters from Wing's. One of them, Fuke #1, stays outside to stand guard as the others approach Chen.

<CHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lucky...are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHEN>
<DIRECTION>
Chen stares at the Tall Kid, goading him with his lack of concern...Three seconds pass like kidney stones... Finally, Chen laughs to himself, stands and puts his finger to the Tall Kid's head as if it were a play gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lack of respect incites the Tall Kid to go for his gun. But before he can fire a shot, Chen produces a .38 from his sleeve and puts a bullet through the gangster's head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Phan drops to the ground as Chen dives over the card table, grabbing his .45. He hits the floor pulling the table down with him as a shield for Phan, then himself as Fuke #2 shoots wildly before being taken out by Chen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack retreats to behind a wall, then slowly crosses through an archway to confront Chen from behind. As he steps out, he finds only Phan cowering on the floor. Chen has disappeared. Suddenly the place explodes in a hail of automatic gunfire as Fuke #1 enters the store and sprays everything in sight, producing a blizzard of glass. Jack turns to see Chen has re-appeared and taken up postion behind a counter full of lamps and mirrors while he takes on both Jack and Fuke #1.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chen skillfully uses one of the counters as cover as he makes his way towards the front ofthe store, gets a bead on the Fuke with the automatic and sends him flying back out the front door in a hail of glass- pedestrians scattering for their life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack, alone now, cowers behind an opposite counter, desperately crawling along the floor trying to make his way out of there. He peeks through an opening to his cover and find Chen nowhere in sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly, painfully hunched over, he backs up towards the blown-out front door, checks for Chen one more time, then decides to make a run for it. Suddenly he's got a foot slamming into the side of his head sending him crashing back to the floor. Chen has appeared out of nowhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chen drives another kick into his stomach, then yanks him to his feet.

A teetering lamp topples from a shot up table but Chen catches it before it hits the floor. He looks over at the owner, crying. Chen places a fist full of fives from his winnings on the counter.

The whistle comes from a screaming teapot. Chen, dressed in a robe, pours the water into a bowl of rice which begins sizzling like a steak. Unlike his wardrobe, his place is modest. The lamp from Phan's fits in nicely.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tired, he stares vacantly at the wallpaper until a gorgeous Chinese girl, 19, walks in from the bedroom. By the way she's tying her dress we know she was recently very naked. He knows her as MAY. Chen slides open a drawer and pulls out some cash.

She bows and walks out the door. Chen watches the young immigrant leave and can't help feeling like half a dirt-bag. He throws the cash back into the drawer and shuts it.
</DIRECTION>

Eventually, he gets up and crosses to the window. He eats his soup in the lifeless apartment, glancing down at the simple, elegant shrine to his dead father. He turns his attention out the window looking out on the palpable energy and vigor of a bustling Chinatown.

A rush of sound as Chen steps from the building. Activity swirls around him as he moves south on the narrow street.
</DIRECTION>

His demeanor starts quiet. But as he moves through the boisterous people, who genuflect like he's an Arab Sheik, a smile curls his lips and the 200 watt bulbs behind his eyes flick on. Every man gets a nod and every girl gets a little bit more. It's his town...and it gives him life.

	A freakin tourist got blown up in our backyard. Not to mention an FBI snitch. And it happened on your watch. The Mayor's been on TV talking about it, the Police Commisioner has promised safety on the streets of Chinatown, Christ it's been on freakin Nightline. So if putting a white cop in the Asian Gang Unit makes them feel better and gets them off my ass fine and dandy. So why don't you get out of here and do something about these whores turning up in dumpsters. It's embarrassing.

Wallace doesn't like it, but doesn't argue it. Chen pulls his .45 and nods to the thick Cop, who thrusts his crowbar into the lock jam and snaps it off. They hit the hallway like a tornado. Bright lights strobe the length of the place thrusting us several minutes into the future.

INT. GINZA MASSAGE HALLWAY - A SHORT TIME LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cops are dragging about ten prostitutes and matching Johns into the hallway.

Chen coordinates when he sees Deng leading May and three other dressed prostitues from the front towards the back hallway. May looks at Chen and he knows why Lee smiled when he gave him the Ginza.

INT. 1ST GINZA BEDROOM

Chen reaches into May's pocket, finding a packet of white powder. She tries to kiss him. He pulls away and pockets the heroin, pissing her off. He quiets her with three hundreds.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Always throw back the smallest of the day's catch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHEN>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly a torrent of automatic gunfire explodes at the opposite end of the hallway taking out the glass door and the uniform who stood in front of it revealing a Fukiense shooter behind the shatterered door. One cop down. Chen's instinct are immediate.The Fuke killer is toast. The uniform who was talking to Wallace turns towards the action and is met with a pile of lead exploding his heart, blowing out his back and spraying Wallace with blood. Wallace freezes- a deer in the headlight. Chen sees this, jumps across the hall and pushes Wallace out of the line of fire and into one of the bedrooms. The doorway where Wallace stood explodes into a million pieces of shrapnel. He would have been chopmeat. Just at that moment, Ung crosses the hall in the opposite direction, shielding a prostitute as he takes out the shooter who took out the uniform and almost Wallace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chen leans out of what remains of the doorway, while yelling back to the still shell-shocked Wallace.
</DIRECTION>
<CHEN>

</CHEN>
<UNG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're Fukes!
	</DIALOGUE>
</UNG>
<DIRECTION>
The entire compliment is pinned down in either the rooms or the hallway facing down three furious Fukes. Chen pumps his final ammo clip into his gun, pulls a second gun from an ankle holster and fires away. Suddenly, another Fuke with an automatic weapon comes out of nowhere and advances kamakazi style to one of the bedrooms- the P.D.'s gunfire no match for his Uzi. He's got Chen, Ung, Deng, Wallace and the five remaining uniforms pinned down. Chen thinks fast, retreats into the bedroom-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. 1ST GINZA BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>

Chen quickly feels the solidity of the walls- finds the weak spot of the plasterboard and starts kicking through to the next room while the firefight continues in the hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. 2ND GINZA BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The uniforms fighting at the doorway turn to see Chen come crashing into their room and continue on right to the next wall, battling his way up the hallway towards the Fukes position the only way he can.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The firefight continues but it's totally one sided as the cops pistols can't compete against the Uzi. Windows to the bedrooms are exploding like firecrackers, whores and johns caught out in the hallway shiver in terror behind whatever cover they can find. A huge glass display in the hallway implodes drenching the place in flying glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wallace does the best he can, firing uselessly at the kamikazi, only visible from the neck up as he keeps the entire force at bay. Suddenly we see a glock come up to the back of the shooter's head which blows his brains out into the hallway, finally silencing the automatic. Chen steps out, the arm behind the hit. There's only three fukes left now, including Jack, armed only with semi-automatics.
</DIRECTION>
<CHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm out on three! One, two, three!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHEN>
<DIRECTION>
Every cop steps out and bombards the end of the hall with all the firepower they've got. They pin back the shooters as Chen storms into the hall and races, guns blazing toward the gunmen. All three of them flee, one down the stairs, Jack and the other up towards the roof. Chen decides to go up, negotiating each corner with whatever he's got left. He gets to the second flight just in time to see Jack desperately kick out a window and make a run across a rooftop. Chen continues the last flight up where he finds the lone Fuke out of amo and desperately trying to tear open the roof acess door which is bolted shut.

</CHEN>
<DIRECTION>
The kid does, but as he moves he suddenly produces a knife the size of a baby's arm that cuts across Chen, slicing his stomach. Chen reacts with amazing speed, smashing his gun across the gangster's head almost decaptating him. Simultaneously, the last Fuke comes charging up the stairs, Chen picks up the guy next to him and hurls him over the staircase knocking the charging Fuke down to the next landing. His gun goes flying right towards Wallace's feet who together with a backup of unifroms, comes bounding around the corner, grabs the weapon and covers the two punks. Chen looks down from top landing

Some of the gangsters stand to run interference, but the two cops push through them to a back table where Bobby Vu works a cell phone. Without a word Chen punches him out of his chair. He hits him again and again, knocking the gangster into the kitchen.

The room is awash in bright light, almost blinding Wallace coming from the darkness. But there, on a bed, he sees the source of the cries. Three young WOMEN engaged in forced sex. He turns toward the light which is set atop a video camera recording the scene. A MAN, mid forties, throws the camera at Wallace and races for the door. Wallace tackles him into the dark hallway...

...and pummels him with his fist. A loud BANG and a flash of light from the end of the hall as someone fires a bullet at Wallace. Instinctively, without thinking, he fires back, hitting the SHOOTER, who slumps to the ground. The impact of his first shooting washes over him. In that moment, the man beneath him pushes to his feet and begins running down the hall.

The man grabs for the dead shooter's gun, turns and takes a bullet from Wallace's Glock before he can squeeze off a shot. Wallace stands frozen. The smoke from his gun fills the tiny hallway. He tastes blood and realizes he bit through his lip.

All is back to normal just days later. The welcome room is filled with young girls smoking. One of the girls is May.

The old Woman calls her over and Chen sees her eye is bruised. May leads him toward the back but halfway down the hall he stops. Chen turns to the old woman and says something in Cantonese. She nods and Chen hands her three hundred dollar bills. He then takes May gently by the arm and escorts her out of the apartment.

<DIRECTION>
Expertly, she glides her hands over his skin, massaging his muscles. He wants to stop her, but he doesn't. The Masseuse moves around, working his arms, legs, back and buttocks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She then climbs on top of him, and using her weight, digs deeper into his muscles. Slight moans begin escaping from his lips. After a moment, she reaches over and dims the lights.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She removes her robe, covers her body with oil and glides herself slowly over Wallace's skin. His eyes move about, showing both his discomfort and enjoyment. She rubs her lips gently across his back to the base of his neck. She kisses his ear as her mouth moves across his face. She turns him onto his back. He looks up into her eyes, knowing he should stop. But he can't. Yellow fever.

She looks at him, not sure why she's there. Neither is he. They stand awkwardly. After a moment, he crosses to the kitchen. He opens the fridge and removes a cellophane bag filled with fruit. He takes a knife from a butcher block and expertly slices a blood orange, separating the rind, removing the seeds. He hands May a sculpted piece of the dark red fruit.

Asian gangster's #2's answer is a barrage of automatic gunfire. Chen responds with one neat shot through the windshield and into the driver's head. Gangster#1 wastes no time pushing the dead driver out from behind the wheel before Chen and Wallace can reach the car and continues their getaway at warp speed. Chen unloads his weapon at the fleeing car before turning and heading towards the Chevy while Wallace charges up a narrow passageway to cut the gangsters off.

With Chen and Wallace closing in, Gangster #2 unloads another burst of gunfire. One of the bullets punctures the windshield, grazes Wallace's ear, exploding the headrest behind him.

The Chevy's not as lucky, as it gets clipped in the rear causing it to spin 90 degrees and slowing their pursuit.

The Lincoln moves fast down Pell and hangs a sharp right careening onto Bowery heading downtown. Chen and Wallace struggle to keep up with pedestrians scattering in all directions. Just as the gangsters reach the first stoplight it turns green. They pull out into the oncoming lane cutting in front of the waiting traffic which is just starting to move. In order to stop them and pin the Chevy in, gangster#2 lets loose a barrage of gunfire which mows down the drivers of the first row of car, pinning the Chevy behind the bloody roadblock. The Lincoln takes off to the right. Chen backs up, sees an opening to an alley parallel to the street and takes off down it hoping to cut them off.

Chen comes right up beside the Lincoln and tries to force it to a stop by pushing it up against the parked cars but the Lincoln just keeps charging, banging an opening through the cars and jumping onto the sidewalk knocking down a half-dozen pedestrians who can't get out of the way fast enough. Chen tracks alongside- gangster#2 spraying automatic fire at them, smashing out the windows of the parked cars. Chen and Wallace do their best to return fire. A delivery truck straddles the sidewalk in front of the Lincoln, instead of slowing, they speed up and at the last moment crash through parked cars, forcing an opening for them to come back onto the street. The parked car they punched through now blocks the Chevy. Rather than stop, Chen blasts onto the opposite sidewalk, pulls up next to the Lincoln while he and Wallace try to blow it out. Suddenly there's an elderly woman pulling her shopping basket in front of them who can't possibly get out of the way.

Gangster #2 seeing the Chevy gaining on them, leans far out his passenger side window and sprays the Lincoln's tires just before a truck pulls out from a loading dock and sends the gangster's body flying through the air like a puppet. The Lincoln doesn't even slow. The Chevy spins uncontrollably, the front end smashing into the elevated lift of a meat truck, which cuts right through the windshield pinning Chen behind a collapsed steering column. Both men, shaken, watch as the Lincoln heads for the end of the street, then suddenly pulls a smoky 180 and heads right back towards them.

Chen begins firing at the Lincoln. Wallace looking between Chen and the fast approaching car, fires also. Chen's gun empties. Because of the chaos of the delivery trucks, the Lincoln has only one way out, and that is to crash straight through the disabled Chevy.

Wallace stays, firing everything he's got. Out of ammo, he quickly turns, dives back in the ca and grabs the shotgun from the back seat. Twenty yards, ten yards, he sees the face of the DRIVER when he gets lucky and a shotgun blast hits the gangster in the chest. The Lincoln spins out of control, twirling like crazy before it hits one of the trucks and explodes in flames. Wallace pulls Chen down as the fireball rolls just over their heads. Chen looks at Wallace as they sit up.

	That's perjury. Why would I do that?

</CHEN>
<SCHABACKER>

Sitting behind a desk is Chen. The Guards put Jack in a chair then step back into the hall. Chen eyes the kid who looks even smaller in his prison rags. He waits a moment, then puts a surveillance photo of Jack's girlfriend Amy San on the table between them.

	Too bad. I can't help you. That's what you told me isn't it?

Jack feels the noose closing around his neck. He doesn't have much choice. He speaks quietly, already afraid of what he has to do.

<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I help you, when they move me, she come too, with papers?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>

</LEE>
<WALLACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No way.

</WALLACE>
<LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My business is victimless. I supply services people want and are forbidden to them by politicians. However, you've seen there're those whose business is not victimless. Whose tactic is violence. I can help you rid Chinatown of those elements, and help keep your father alive. All I ask, is that you look out for my interests in return.

</LEE>
<WALLACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're asking for more than that.

</WALLACE>
<LEE>

	Long after you and I are gone there will be gambling in Chinatown. There will be men willing to pay a woman for her favors. And the police will always be the last to know. That's a fact...Now you can chase your tail in the dark and accomplish nothing, or you can really do some good. For the people of Chinatown, for your career and for your father.

Lee circles his table and approaches Wallace.

<LEE>

	Think of how many more young girls would have ended up in dumpsters if not for your acceptance of my help.

The moment of choice. Its consequences are not lost on Wallace. The decision is not easy...but slowly, he shakes his head.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TIN SHOP - CONTINUOUS - DAY

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But he doesn't shoot because the gun belongs to Chen, in the middle of busting the two drug dealers. Eyes wild and still YELLING, Chen nearly squeezes the trigger himself, but his brain registers Wallace faster than his finger.
</DIRECTION>

The two cops, breathing hard, stare at each other knowing exactly how the other got there. After a moment, Chen cuffs the two prisoners to the radiator and pushes Wallace back into the store.

Chen grabs Wallace by the neck.

Chen looks back at Wallace.

<WALLACE>

	I was the first Chinese cop in the Fifteenth. Thought I was gonna clean up Chinatown. But white cops wouldn't work with me and the people wouldn't talk to a cop, Chinese or not. Only Uncle Benny paid me any attention. He became my godfather, took care of my debts. Henry Lee was his lieutenant. He fed me a few busts, made me look good and I liked it. Then one night my father walks into a gambling house and ends up dead. Turns out Lee knew there was a contract on him. Made it clear he could've told me, I could've stopped it...Got me thinking I was better at my job with him, than without him.

INT. CHEN'S BUILDING, HALLWAY OUTSIDE HIS APARTMENT-NIGHT

Lying against the door, cold and pasty white, is May. Chen quickly checks her vitals, then lifts her in his arms and carries her back outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GAS STATION, QUEENS-NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Fukienese crew sit packed into a stolen Buick Regal as one of the boys pumps unleaded into the tank. Jack in the middle of the back seat fidgets like an inmate on death row.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GAS STATION PAYPHONE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stops at a payphone nestled between the men's and lady's rooms. His hands tremble as he slides in the quarter and dials the number off Chen's card. He checks the number of the phone, punches it in along with his code. He hits the pound key, hangs up and waits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HUDSON ST CLINIC: HOSPITAL ROOM -NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The population, STAFF and CLIENTELE, is mostly Asian, Spanish, and poor. The pace is fast and the care minimal by necessity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind a curtain, May lies sleeping, I.V. tubing supplying nutrition, an oxygen mask supplying life. Chen watches her when his pager goes off. He checks the number, recognizing the pager code he gave Jack as a young DOCTOR enters the area.
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's lucky you found her.

</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm alright. Let's go.

Bobby stops him...and picks up the phone. He puts the receiver to his ear, but doesn't say a word.

EXT. BENNY WONG'S HOUSE, FLUSHING QUEENS-NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chinatown Two and definitely the nicest. An upper income, suburban neighborhood populated by American-born Chinese.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Out front of the gated corner house is the Bobby Vu's car. The Fukeniese fan out around the walls surrounding the property.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BENNY WONG'S BEDROOM-NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Benny Wong sits in a club chair watching an episode of Sinbad when he hears the KRAK KRAK KRAK of gunfire coming from inside his house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He quickly searches his desk drawer finding a .38 caliber pistol. He turns toward the door and freezes as he looks into the eyes of Bobby Vu and the other three Fukienese who point submachine guns at his chest. Bobby Vu smiles....Benny Wong stares at him.
</DIRECTION>
<BENNY_WONG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not man enough to kill me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENNY_WONG>

In a flash, Benny brings the revolver to his temple and shoots himself. Bobby Vu looks at the old man lying dead.
</DIRECTION>

</BOBBY_VU>
<DIRECTION>
The four youths open up, turning Benny Wong into hamburger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BENNY WONG'S BATHROOM-NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens and Bobby Vu enters. He lifts the lid and begins to pee unaware of MRS. WONG who lies paralyzed with fear in the bathtub.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She tries to lie quietly as he unzips his pants. The sound of liquid hitting liquid mixes with the faint cry of police sirens in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He finishes, takes one step toward the exit then turns and begins firing into the glass shower door. He stops. Walks through the smoke filled room and stands over Mrs. Wong, alive, but cut to pieces in the bottom of the tub. He looks down at her and nonchalantly points his gun at her chest. She begins to cry as he pulls the trigger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WORTH STREET-DAY

Through the glass door we see Wallace and Ung catch up on paperwork as Detective Deng comes through it, into the hall where the coffee machine sits. She pours black coffee into a thirty-ounce cup, then hits it with a half dozen sugars. Chen walks up.
</DIRECTION>
<CHEN>

This gets Chen's attention, but he tries to dismiss it.
</DIRECTION>
<CHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've heard that every month for ten years.

</CHEN>
<DIRECTION>
Deng presses, like she's trying to tell Chen something more.
</DIRECTION>
<DENG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So have I, but this time I hear they have tapes, photos, the whole nine yards. They're pissed off about their agent and Benny Wong getting killed and they want to hang somebody for it.

INT. GAMBLING PARLOR-DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chen enters the underground parlor. But today it's empty, except for Henry Lee, the Sumo, two other triad soldiers and the dealer from last nights gambling. Lee is here to collect his cut. His minions immediately frisk Chen and take his guns from him.
</DIRECTION>
<CHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Think I have a reason to use them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHEN>
<LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not sure. Lately you've forgotten that what happens to me, happens to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<DIRECTION>
Lee makes sure Chen gets the message.
</DIRECTION>
<CHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Feds are making a case against Wallace. We need to cut him loose.

</DIRECTION>
<LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Personal attacks are going to get us nowhere, Detective.

</LEE>
<DIRECTION>
Chen can barely breathe, let alone get to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I'll tell you what. I'll take your advice to a point. I'll sever any traceable ties between us...and give Wallace a few arrests to knock the shoo- flies off his heels.

Lee and his men start for the door, then stop.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Today's payday for dirty cops. Make sure you give Wallace his cut.

Chen walks up Elizabeth Street toward the station entrance when he sees Wallace hurrying out of the building.
</DIRECTION>
<CHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wallace.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHEN>
<DIRECTION>
The young cop either ignores the sound or didn't hear it, cause he heads straight for a patrol car parked at the back of the police lot. Chen yells after him.
</DIRECTION>
<CHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where're you going?

<DIRECTION>
Wallace stops, lets Chen catch up.

	</DIALOGUE>
</CHEN>
<DIRECTION>
Wallace turns away. Watches some cops heading off duty.
</DIRECTION>
<CHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not saying it's fatal. Point now is to cover tracks and keep everything clean on the surface. And when they call you in, keep your mouth shut.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHEN>
<WALLACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wish I never got into this.

<CHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You and me both.

</CHEN>
<DIRECTION>
Chen reaches into his pocket and takes out the money he got from Lee, careful that no one sees him. He peels off several bills.
</DIRECTION>
<CHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is your cut from Lee. Three grand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHEN>
<DIRECTION>
Wallace looks at Chen. He doesn't want to touch the money...but he needs it. So he slips it into his jacket.
</DIRECTION>

</SCHABACKER>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The tape is good. Probably enough for convictions on Bobby Vu and the rest. But I think we hold off until they make their move to bring in the illegal shipment. We bust 'em on the ship. Then we go for the murder charge, the smuggling rap and with Jack here connecting the dots to an ongoing criminal enterprise, we meet our racketeering requirements and get life sentences.

</CHEN>
<MARGARET>

	There's enough to drag him before a grand jury, but it's gonna be his word against their word and he'll win. We wait till after the shipment comes in, then the tape's got merit.

He reaches for a hand towel but it's stuck in the dispenser. He rips down on the towel with all the rage, frustration and anger inside him, tearing the metal dispenser from the wall and slamming it into the sink, the wall and finally to the ground. He then tries to steady himself, but he's too upset. But then his pager goes off. He calms himself, checks the number...then dials. A voice answers.

A huge container ship sits silently at dock. We focus closer on the Wheelhouse.

Through night vision goggles we see the adjacent parking lot. All seems calm at the moment.

Chen stands quietly in the darkness looking through the night vision goggles.
</DIRECTION>
<CHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No sign of anybody.

He turns and hands the goggles to Wallace.

There's a long pause. We watch Chen's face turn to stone.
</DIRECTION>
<CHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about Internal Affairs?

Wallace flinches but covers.
</DIRECTION>
<WALLACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?

</CHEN>

Wallace is about to answer when he sees a tractor trailer pull into the lot.
</DIRECTION>
<WALLACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're here. Take a look.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALLACE>
<DIRECTION>
He turns to give the goggles to Chen.

<DIRECTION>
Chen quietly cocks his gun and points it at the back of Wallace's head.
</DIRECTION>
<CHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What would you do if you knew I.A. had a case against you? Would you run?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHEN>
<WALLACE>
<DIRECTION>
(increasingly uncomfortable)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know what I'd do. What would you do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALLACE>
<DIRECTION>
Wallace is unaware of Chen standing directly behind him, sweat building on his face- ready to pull the trigger.
</DIRECTION>
<CHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean after I killed whoever ratted on me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHEN>
<DIRECTION>
Wallace's blood turns to ice. He lowers the goggles, turns slowly and comes face to face with the barrel of Chen's gun. It's instantly clear Chen knows all.
</DIRECTION>
<CHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should have let me die in the car that day. At least then I die a cop.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHEN>
<WALLACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are a cop- a good cop. And I'll tell anyone who asks.
	</DIALOGUE>

Chen hesitates. Not sure what to believe.
</DIRECTION>
<CHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHEN>
<WALLACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know what I am. All I know is you saved me and you saved my father. My life is really yours to do with as you wish.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALLACE>
<DIRECTION>
His words hang heavy in the air...and then Chen fires. But not at Wallace. He fires past his head, through the glass of the wheel house and hits the FUKENESE gangster who was about to blow them away with an assault rifle. A beat, and automatic fire comes from another window, spraying the wheelhouse with hot metal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wallace takes out the shooter as Chen flies out the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Momentarily dazed, Wallace recovers, scrambles to his feet- looks around, but Chen has disappeared.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT/EXT. FUNNEL CHAMBER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wallace enters slowly and traverses the three storey high metal grate walkways. WE HEAR only the clank of his feet as he descends deep into the ship.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELECTRICAL ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chen moves stealthily passed the huge humming generators, slowly approaching each blind curve. HE HEARS what sounds like the distant cry of an infant. He keeps moving
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIDEO SURVEILLANCE P.O.V. - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see Chen move through the room towards the exit. An arm carrying an UZI passes in front of the camera.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ANCHOR ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wallace cocks his ear to the same sound as he moves through the room dominated by the giant chains that connect to the lowered anchors. Just at that moment a Fuke moves out from behind the casing and gets off a shot that cuts right through Wallace's left hand. He yelps in pain as he takes cover, rips the sleeve of his shirt to stem the bleeding, then waits for the Fuke to make his move. He does- Wallace stands right up at him and takes him out in a fierce exchange.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ENGINE ROOM FIRST FLOOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cavernous energy center of the ship. Four storey's high. A cacophony of the brute force of the engines and the steel walkways that encircle them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chen comes out on the bottom level. All seems quiet, except for what seems like the distant hum of human whispering. He moves slowly out into the open. The place seems empty until suddenly a shape appears on the metal catwalk two storey's above. He turns with lightening speed- points, ready to shoot at...Wallace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a tense standoff. Neither wants to lower their weapon first. The sound of distant murmuring grows louder until suddenly the standoff is ended by a common enemy. Wallace whips around and sends a fuke who was about to shoot him flying back against a wall. Chen suddenly finds a Fuke charging down metal stairs towards him. He blasts him before he can get a shot off- the Fukes lifeless body toboganning down to land at Chen's feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One holdout, BLACK EYES, equipped with an AK47 on the top floor will not be taken out. Like some madman on crack he sprays crazily in every direction until finally Chen just goes for it stepping out into the open and pummeling BLACK EYES with bullets. A pipe behind the Fuke explodes with steam, enveloping Black eyes who falls limply onto a vertical crane. Chen and Wallace relax a beat and then BANG! Black Eyes is up and charging Wallace. Chen is faster, spraying him with everything left in his weapon, hitting and igniting a fuel pipe which spills out it's fiery liquid setting BLACK EYES aflame. The dying Fuke grabs onto some hanging rope and in a last defiant act, swings down the three storeys all the time firing and coming almost face to face with Chen before being finally silenced- his incinerated corpse landing at Chen's feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wallace scans the area while he descends the stairs towards Chen. There are no Fukes in sight. The human murmuring grows louder. Without speaking, Chen and Wallace move towards the source of the sounds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PASSAGEWAY ANTEROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chen and Wallace move slowly down the few steps to a heavy steel door beyond which the sounds seems to emanate. With silent gestures they work like the partners they've become. Wallace opening the door and stepping back, covering Chen as he makes his move.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing could have prepared them for what they find on the other side of the door. There, as far as the eye can see, running the entire length of the ship, is the cargo Lee awarded the Fuke's. Several hundred illegal Chinese immigrants huddled together in unspeakable conditions, stuffed into a tiny opening that resemble's an endless train compartment. Their dark vacant eyes stare back at the shocked cops who move cautiously through the passageway. It doesn't take long for the remaining Fuke's to make their presence known with a bullet destined for Chen, and intercepted by the back of an innocent young male immigrant.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chen, Wallace and the desperate group of illegals flatten themselves against the sides of the corridor. SILENCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chen steps out quickly as if to take a shot, but it's a sucker punch as he immediately tucks himself back in then out again just in time to duck the bullet from a Fuke and plant his own squarely in the gangster's chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chen ducks back behind the steel separators that occur about every twenty feet in the passageway. Wallace is one "compartment" back. A young boy, no more than six years old, drifts out into harm's way. Wallace reaches out quickly and pulls him to his side. While Wallace keeps quard, the kid holds onto his hand and begins to sympathetically rub his bandage- his eyes pleading for salvation of any kind. Chen looks back sees this and Wallace's empathic reaction to pat the young kid on the head. Chen hesitates a second, then...
</DIRECTION>
<CHEN>
<DIRECTION>
(whisper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wallace...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHEN>
<DIRECTION>
Wallace snaps to. Chen indicates for him to follow as he sprints out and moves quickly down the narrow tunnel past the endless collection of immigrant pawns. We see their desperation not only in their faces, but in their pathetic little bundles that contain all their worldly belongings. They mutter Cantonese pleas.
</DIRECTION>
<CHEN_AND_WALLACE>
<DIRECTION>
(Cantonese)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quiet...quiet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHEN_AND_WALLACE>
<DIRECTION>
They come to a stop. Listen a moment to the silence.
</DIRECTION>
<WALLACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe that's all of them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALLACE>
<CHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bobby Vu's here, and he'll never leave without us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHEN>
<WALLACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Without you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALLACE>
<DIRECTION>
Wallace moves out quickly out into the passageway as if taunting Vu to make his move. He stops two compartments down. Chen is one compartment behind. They exchange looks. Chen indicates to "stay put".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wallace peaks out from behind the steel. One of the oldest women in the hold, a grandmotherly face of China, motions for Wallace to come closer.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANDMOTHERLY_TYPE>

	<DIALOGUE>

</WALLACE>
<GRANDMOTHERLY_TYPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDMOTHERLY_TYPE>
<DIRECTION>
Chen watches as Wallace moves out and approaches the woman. Suddenly the image goes into hyper slo-mo. We see the woman mouthing the Cantonese words for "come here". Back on Chen, there suddenly something wrong. He looks closely at the old woman, and then, operating purely on instinct, he races forward.
</DIRECTION>
<CHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	NO!!!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHEN>
<DIRECTION>
Just as Wallace steps up to the woman, CHEN pushes Wallace aside and takes the automatic fire that Bobby Vu shoots from behind an innocent skirt. Wallace immediately raises his gun and fires two in the chest and one in the head. Just like Chen taught him. Bobby Vu's body hits the floor with a thud. Dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wallace looks down at Chen as the blood begins spreading out around him. Quickly, he kneels beside his partner, gathers him in his arm and tries to control the bleeding, but the wound is deep. He turns toward a commotion at the entrance to the tunnel and sees a bunch of Feds and uniforms heading towards him.
</DIRECTION>
<WALLACE>
	<DIALOGUE>

Chen tries to catch his breath, but he can't seem to.
</DIRECTION>
<WALLACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're alright. You're OK.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALLACE>
<DIRECTION>
Chen's body spasms from the pain.
</DIRECTION>
<WALLACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry.

<DIRECTION>
Chen grabs hold of Wallace's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<CHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>

Wallace looks into Chen's eyes. He's fading in and out.

A tiny smile escapes from Chen just before he loses consciousness and is surrounded by an EMS team.

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR-DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kirpatrick, a manila envelope in his hand, rushes down the hallway with Schabacker.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They hurry to the Intensive Care ward stopping outside a room where a uniformed OFFICER stands guard. Through the window in the door they can see Wallace leaning close to Chen who lies motionless in the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHABACKER>
<DIRECTION>
(to the OFFICER)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get Wallace out here.

The Officer doesn't move so Schabacker pulls out his FBI badge and shoves it close to the cops face.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHABACKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHABACKER>
<DIRECTION>
The Officer gets up slowly from his chair as the door swings open and Wallace exits from the room. He looks at the two men then starts down the hall when Kirpatrick slaps him across the chest with the manila envelope.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRPATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's this bullshit?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRPATRICK>
<WALLACE>

	Exactly what it says. That after a month long investigation, there's no evidence to support any charges against Lt. Nicholas Chen.

	You think you can get away with this forget it. He's responsible for the death of a Federal Agent.

An ICU team races down the hall and charges into Chen's room.

Lee gets up, along with his attorney. He turns to Wallace.
</DIRECTION>
<LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was very saddened to hear about your friend, Lt. Chen...Oh, I'm sorry, he wasn't your friend after all, was he? Lee puts on his coat and leans close to Wallace.

</LEE>
<LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I'd like to thank you for killing all the witnesses against me.

<WALLACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not all. Not the one who recorded this tape.

Wallace plays a short sample of Jack's tape and the smile fades from Lee's face...which makes Wallace smile as Deng and Ung lead Lee out in cuffs.

End credits roll as the NYPD honor and bury their own. In a funeral procession that draws on traditional Chinese culture as well as present day police decorum, the men and women who serve and protect parade down the small Chinatown street in full dress blues. Banners depicting the face of Nick Chen wave out front as his coffin, draped in the American flag draws cheers from the people of Chinatown. And no one louder than Detective Daniel Wallace.
