The ditch is littered with garbage. The DRONE of INSECTS. No visible traces of toxic waste. A butterfly net sweeps through the air to capture an oversized horsefly.

Mike pauses at the desert tank, watching a cricket search for food. A trap-door spider pops out of its camouflaged den like a jack-in-the-box. The arachnid yanks the cricket below and replaces the roof in a nanosecond.

Mike looks in another tank where ogre-eyed spitting spiders shoot blasts of paralyzing goo at hapless insects.

Joshua unveils the tank. Dirt floor. Several burrow entrances. Joshua pours in the bugs. A large, male tarantula comes out of a burrow. It pounces on a bug, then wraps its prey in webbing, turning the insect into a mummy-like bundle.

Joshua leads Mike to the back of the tank. A network of subterranean tunnels is revealed. The male tarantulas scuttle through carrying their mummified offerings.
</DIRECTION>
<JOSHUA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take a look, the female of the species is three times as big as the male.

Mike peers into a large den. The female tarantula steps out of the shadows. This is Consuela, the Chilean red tarantula.
</DIRECTION>
<JOSHUA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say hello to Consuela.

Mike watches Consuela unwrap one of the mummified bundles. She begins to eat the paralyzed insect within.

Chris chips at the wall with his pickaxe. As it makes contact, the occasional spark flies up. Chris pauses to scrutinize the target area with his helmet-light.
</DIRECTION>

Something sneaks along the floor of the mine behind him.

Chris is oblivious to his unseen stalker. He chips away a section of stone to reveal shiny minerals. Reflections of silver and gold splash across his face. His smile fades...

Chris bends over, reaching for a bottle of water. A large rat scurries out of hiding dragging away Chris's sack lunch.

Chris grabs his pick-axe and goes after the rat. The rodent dodges every hit. Sparks fly when the axe strikes rock. These ignite a vent of methane gas.

A BRIEF EXPLOSION knocks Chris off his feet. He notices a small hole in the floor is lit like the burner on a stove. Chris pats out the flame as the rat scurries away with lunch.

Ashley rubs conditioner into her hair. The lather builds. Covering her face. Forcing her eyes closed once more. The spider returns across its web right in front of her eyes.

The water stops. Ashley reaches for the showerhead blindly knocking the spider off its web. She feels no water coming out, and fumbles for a washcloth. Reaching with eyes closed, she can't see the little spider has landed on top of the cloth. As Ashley retrieves it, the spider scurries onto its opposite side.

Ashley wipes the soap off her face. The spider rides the washcloth and moves toward her hand. Before it can strike, Ashley gets her eyes clear and drops the cloth.

EXT. BEVERLY'S HOUSE (TOWN) - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beverly uncoils a hose, cranks a spigot. She sprays her vegetable garden with water. After a beat, a solid object is coughed up through the hose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beverly continues watering. Two more unidentified objects are spewed from the hose. She reacts by cranking the spigot on full. The water sprays harder. Then inexplicably stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beverly checks the spigot. She looks into the opening of the hose. Puts it to her ear and listens. Sniffs. Now she puts the end of the hose in her mouth and sucks deeply, trying to siphon away the blockage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beverly removes the hose. A FAINT RUMBLING sound. She puts it back in her mouth and sucks. A solid object comes through the hose and into her mouth. Then another. And another. A dozen things pump through the hose and into her mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beverly yanks it out. Water spews from her mouth and out of the hose. Apparently the blockage has cleared.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beverly falls to her knees. Hunching forward. She vomits forth a stomach full of water... and small spiders. Mouth agape. Eyes wide in horror. She watches them scurry into the garden. Beverly tries to scream... but can only retch.

Mike slips past the barricades. Following the tracks to the edge of the abyss. He can't see anything. It's too dark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mike turns away and returns to the yard. Never realizing...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Several feet down the shaft. Hidden under a rock... the shriveled and desiccated corpse of Joshua Taft. It hangs from the side of the shaft in thick sticky webbing. Grisly.

Chris shines his light into the darkness. Trying to see what's causing the unsettling crescendo...

Suddenly dozens of RATS burst from the darkness.

Mike follows the trail toward another mine entrance. This one is plugged with concrete. The tracks don't go there. They stop at what appears to be a normal patch of ground. Several ostrich feathers are scattered nearby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mike takes a closer look. Something doesn't seem right. An odd demarcation in the soil. His fingers trace the edge of a thin film of material. It is a lid of sorts. A sheath of sticky webbing coated with dirt. Mike is able to lift it.

Bret is dazed as he gets to his feet. Then his eyes rack-focus to a nearby dune. A Rottweiler-sized jumping spider stands atop it. Two large eyes surrounded by six smaller orbs. Orange and black designs on its abdomen. Wiry hair. Dagger-sized fangs. Bret can't quite believe what he sees.

The basement door is wide open. Gladys mixes food in a bowl. A cigarette with a massive ash hangs off her lip.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A male tarantula moves across the ceiling. The creature is the size of a pit bull. Two quivering palps flank dart-sized fangs. Multiple eyes the size of quarters. Hair all over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gladys is oblivious to the ominous threat above her. As she works, the spider shadows her. Every time the spider is about to strike, she goes another direction to get spices, utensils, a pan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gladys places her bowl on the stove. Suddenly the tarantula drops onto the stove right in front of her. Gladys shrieks. The tarantula lashes out at her. Gladys grabs a frying pan and smashes it across the face as she stumbles backward. The spider reels, striking the burner knobs, turning on the gas.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gladys registers the sound of ESCAPING GAS. She looks back toward the fuse box and makes a run for it. As she goes, the tarantula fires a webline at her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gladys gets the fuse off the top of the fuse box, but the webline prevents her from slotting it home.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gladys strains with all her might, finally slots the fuse. She turns toward the kitchen just in time to see the broken burner spark to life. The gas ignites. The tarantula is engulfed in flame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gladys is knocked down by the blast. She lies on her back when a second male tarantula nails her with a webline. Gladys screams as she's dragged across the floor toward the basement door.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A melancholy N'SYNC ballad plays over a BOOM BOX. Ashley sits on her bed with her back to the open window. The sun setting in the distance. She rips up the photographs of Bret.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ashley doesn't notice the Great Dane-sized spitting spider crawling in through her window. It is striped like a jungle predator.

It comes all the way into the room and then lingers among Ashley's stuffed animal collection.

Ashley stops ripping. She goes to the pile of animals, oblivious to the spider. The beast doesn't move. Ashley grabs a pink teddy bear with a heart on its belly. She returns to bed and cuts the bear's heart out with scissors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The spitting spider sneaks up behind Ashley. As it moves, so does Ashley. She scoops up the torn photos and mutilated bear, dumping them in the trash. She turns around to find the giant spider on her bed. She freezes momentarily.

Ashley sees her stun gun is on the dresser. She lunges for it. She's almost got it. The spider squirts two lines of gummy web at Ashley. The glop hits her int he chest, carries her backward. Glues her to the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GARAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

INT. ASHLEY'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris puts himself between Ashley and the spider. He looks for a weapon. Lunges for the scissors, but the spitter nails him with a blast of glue.

The group moves closer. They sine their lights on a horrifying sight. Joshua's corpse is a deflated flesh balloon. Yellowed teeth sneer from a shattered skull. He's completely desiccated. Every ounce of liquid drained away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mike hides his eyes. Ashley comforts him.
</DIRECTION>

Chris runs over and slices it open with his machete. The web comes away to reveal a human hand.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's somebody in here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRIS>
<DIRECTION>
Chris cuts away more web as the other survivors help. They finally reveal Gladys.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gladys!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRIS>

The woman's body begins to spasm.

Suddenly Ashley pushes her way forward.
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Her breathing is shallow. She's going into arrest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Ashley proceeds with CPR. Just like she saw on TV. Suddenly Gladys snaps out of it. Gasping for air.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay. It's okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRIS>
<DIRECTION>
Gladys starts to get a grip. Trying to focus on Chris. From this angle Chris look like he has a golden halo.

</GLADYS>
<DIRECTION>
Gladys points behind Chris's head to the wall of the cavern. The group turns their lights on it. The reflection is dazzling. Veins of gold criss-cross the cavern walls.
</DIRECTION>
<WADE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gold! Gold! Look! It's everywhere!

Chris checks it out.

Chris helps Gladys to her feet. They share an emotional look of recognition.
</DIRECTION>
<GLADYS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So were you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLADYS>
<DIRECTION>
Wade chips away at the gold.

Bret looks at Ashley.

Ashley smiles.

The group sees a cluster of normal-sized tarantulas scuttling out of the shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<NORMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the big deal?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Norman steps on the closest one, grinding it under his boot. He stomps around, crushing as many as he can. Mike watches this curiously. Taking a look at one of the squashed bodies.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you should stop.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<NORMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORMAN>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They don't have hair. They aren't fully grown tarantulas.

</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
Chris and Sam look over.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're giant babies!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
Norman freezes. He hears SOMETHING MOVING around in the dark. And then a spine chilling... GROWL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris reacts to the noise. He can guess what's coming...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The FEMALE TARANTULA steps out of the shadows. Consuela has grown to be as big as a Volkswagen MicroBus. By far the largest spider we've seen yet. Covered in hair. Massive eyes. Her two fangs are the size of machetes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mike's eyes go wide at the sight of his old nemesis.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Consuela.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<CHRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Consuela?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRIS>
<DIRECTION>
The fur on Consuela's back seems to undulate. There is something weird there. A lot of weird things. In fact... her entire back is littered with hundreds of baby tarantulas.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Consuela advances, she flicks several dart-sized quills off her belly right into Norman. A dark stain spreads across the drug dealer's shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<NORMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bummer...
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Consuela pierces Norman with her fangs, holding him tight. Babies flood of her back and onto the doper, chewing him to pieces like ravenous piranhas.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRIS>
<DIRECTION>
The group flees toward the opposite end of the cavern. A male tarantula drops down to block their escape. Sam BLOWS it away. Wade and Bret are still chipping away bits of gold.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leave it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRIS>
<WADE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you can keep it all!? Hell no!

</WADE>

Wade gets a nugget off the wall. He only has a nanosecond to admire it before Consuela suddenly looms behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<BRET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRET>
<DIRECTION>
Bret reaches out toward his father. Wade reaches for him. Consuela's fangs suddenly protrude from Wade's chest and he's hauled backward. The tarantula flings Wade into the cave.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bret, come on!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRIS>
<DIRECTION>
Bret runs after the others. But he sees Consuela firing more quills at the group. Directly at Ashley. Bret leaps into harm's way. He's turned into a pin cushion.
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bret!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Ashley goes to his side.
</DIRECTION>

Bret dies. Sam drags Ashley away from him.

Sam and Chris share a brief beat. And then Chris pulls down the lights, dragging them back toward the tarantula's den.

He positions the shattered light bulb beside this gas jet.

Chris bails out of the cavern and starts running.

INT. MINE TUNNELS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

Sam and Ashley flee the male tarantula. Sam stumbles over something on the ground. It's Bret Hale's lost motorcycle. Ashley looks back and sees the tarantula coming after them.
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hurry!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Sam lifts the MOTORCYCLE upright and climbs on. She STARTS it and REVS the ENGINE. Ashley leaps aboard. Sam accelerates along the shaft, away from the spider. The bike's headlight illuminates their path.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The male tarantula scurries after the bike.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam rides the motorcycle along the shaft. Ashley hangs on tight. They've put some distance between themselves and the male tarantula. A dead-end looms before them. Ashley screams as her mom stops on a dime and does a 180.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam rides back the way they came, heading straight toward the male tarantula. Ashley looks over her mother's shoulder at the giant spider coming in the opposite direction.
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Sam lifts the bike into a wheelie as the tarantula nears.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Banzai!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
With perfect timing, she brings the front wheel down hard onto the tarantula's back. Crunch! The spider is roadkill. Sam steers them down another tunnel.

A broken light bulb sparks. The filament ignites the gas-filled tunnel. A ball of flame spreads throughout the mines.

The spiders retreat from daylight. Scuttling back into the buildings. Heading down into the mine shafts.

<DIRECTION>
The survivors pile into the truck as the town begins to BLOW UP in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris is just about to climb aboard when... A webline shoots out of the nearby mine shaft. Consuela lives! The spider is charred and bloody. But she's primed for revenge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris is yanked off his feet and hauled toward her. He fumbles for his machete and hacks at the webline. Cutting himself free just before getting impaled on Consuela's fangs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Consuela knocks away Chris's machete and lunges down at him. Chris kicks her belly with both his feet. Consuela begins to shudder. Jagged cracks appear in her charred carapace. Chris kicks and tears at the failing armor. He thinks he's harming the tarantula, but he's actually helping it!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mike and the others watch from the humvee.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh no... she's molting!

</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
Consuela's blistered shell cracks as she shrugs the damaged skin away from her body. Chris is amazed to see the spider has grown a full size larger and become totally rejuvenated!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Consuela comes after Chris. He defends himself with the machete.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shining steel makes contact with the dripping fangs. Once again Consuela punts away the machete. She prepares the death blow. It looks like curtains for Chris.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Consuela! No! Bad! Bad Consuela!

The massive spider stops in shock. Chris looks back to see Mike has returned.

He throws his Cassiopeia PDA at the spider's face...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris uses this moment of confusion to grab his machete and drive it deep into the spider's unprotected abdomen...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tarantula screams.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris leaps up and runs, scooping up Mike. They dive into the back of the humvee.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Consuela tries to follow but is mortally wounded. She collapses in the dust. The TOWN EXPLODES in the b.g. The earth itself begins to collapse.

<DIRECTION>
INT. HUMVEE - DRIVING ACROSS DESERT - DAY

Everyone looks to the road ahead. A familiar bunny rabbit hops across the highway. Gladys HONKS and swerves to avoid it.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

The bunny gets clear as the humvee drives away toward safety.
</DIRECTION>

The rabbit continues its trek for a moment, and then is grabbed by a large trap-door spider.

FADE OUT.
