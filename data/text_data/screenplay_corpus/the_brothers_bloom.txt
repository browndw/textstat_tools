Bloom pushes the leaves aside. A girl. Golden curls. Summer dress. Standing in the distance on a wide lawn.

Bloom gazes. Stephen places his hand on Bloom's back.

Deep in the cave's dark maw, a spark of light.

The children gasp collectively. The Girl grabs Bloom's arm.

Bloom stares, transfixed as any of them.

The spark becomes a glowing, fluttering point of light, which hangs in the mouth of the cave for a tantalizing moment, then recedes deeper into the gloom.

With a cry the children, Bloom included, dash into the cave.

INT. CAVE

The light glows just around the next corner... the children run after it, slipping in the mud, laughing, turning the corner...

And the light glows just around the next corner. They scramble, they slip and slide, they can't catch the light, but they're all having the time of their lives.

For McGuire is, of course, Stephen.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>

INT. DEUTCH MARK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A low, cozy basement level bar. A dozen people crowd it, all expectant in a surprise-party type way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A TURKISH GENTLEMAN in a white linen suit and eye patch raises his drink when Bloom, Stephen and the woman enter.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_TURK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Make way, make room for the brothers Bloom!

The bar bursts into cheers.

<DIRECTION>
INT. DEUTCH MARK - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A DWARF dances on the bar. Stephen plays cards with the Turk, an ALBINO and a small crowd of character types.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_TURK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nine months, six countries, three faked deaths, for one mark. You're a beautiful antique, my friend.

	One thing baffles me. The entire con would have fallen apart if Charleston had walked away. How did you know he'd pull the trigger?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_TURK>
<DIRECTION>
Stephen riffle shuffles a pack of cards.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just think of any card. Got one?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
Stephen cuts the deck randomly - 2 of spades.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_TURK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_TURK>
<DIRECTION>
Stephen shrugs.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	But if I do it enough, eventually it'll work on someone. And then it'll be the best card trick in the world.
	</DIALOGUE>

Wink. The dwarf slips, plummets from the bar. Stephen kicks a chair across the room, into which he lands with a crunch.

Back at the bar - the Asian woman. The CHINK. Being hit on by a weasly ROMANIAN.
</DIRECTION>
<ROMANIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I'm pretty big into anime.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMANIAN>
<DIRECTION>
She almost imperceptibly rolls her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our fifth Beatle. She knows the ins and the outs, and so far as I can tell, speaks three words of English.
	</DIALOGUE>

She taps on the bar.

</THE_ALBINO>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just till the wind changes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
Stephen makes a gun with his finger and shoots at the Chink.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She flicks a champaign flute to make a `DING!' and mimes the bullet bouncing off her.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_TURK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is Bloom?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_TURK>
<DIRECTION>
In the corner of the bar, in a private booth with drawn velvet curtains, Bloom sits alone playing solitaire. Stuck with a queen of hearts he can't play.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beautiful woman in scarlet with auburn hair pokes her face through the curtains.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There you are. Hiding?

</ROSE>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.

<ROSE>

	I've been learning. Stephen likes to talk about you.

</ROSE>
<BLOOM>

	Did he tell you the cave story?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it true?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What else did he tell you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not going to tell it as good as Stephen. You two kicked around till your early teens, then stowed away on a merchant marine freighter and ended up in St. Petersburg, where you spent five years under the tutelage of a shadowy old swindler named the Diamond Dog. And he was your Fagin and Stephen was his Artful Dodger, but it ended suddenly and badly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stephen took his eye out with an antique rapier.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why did he do that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And then the Brothers Bloom lit out on their own to make their fortune as gentleman thieves. Sounds romantic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It does.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
She pushes the cards aside and slides clumsily onto the table, her face inches from Bloom's, eyes closed, expecting a kiss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom's eyes stay open.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to know how Stephen did it? With Charleston?

<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>

INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A replay of Bloom in front of the flaming bookshelf.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He positioned me in the same spot where, seven years ago, Charleston's wife stood and told him she was leaving.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
The room transforms, becomes daylit, not on fire, seven years ago, a WIFE standing in Bloom's place.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) (cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He chose my outfit to mirror her suit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
Sure enough, the colors and shape of Bloom's suit matches the Wife's outfit.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) (cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He even phonetically matched my final words to hers.

</BLOOM>
<WIFE>

	This is the end. Charelston, you've always been a dunce.

Everything snaps back to Bloom in the flaming room.

BANG.

<DIRECTION>
INT. DEUTCH MARK
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what he does, he writes his cons the way dead Russians write novels, with thematic arcs and imbedded symbolism and shit. And he wrote me as a vulnerable anti- hero. And that's why you think you want to kiss me. It's a con.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
He leaves Rose lying on the table and sweeps through the bar towards the exit, passing Stephen.

EXT. BERLIN STREET - EARLY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom stumbles up stone steps to street level. A THOUSAND YEAR OLD MAN sweeps up across the square.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom sits wearily on the curb, bowler hat in hand, shirt bright red with fake blood, face long as hell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Putting the broom aside a moment, the old man walks painfully across the street to Bloom. Standing nearly toe to toe with him, the man pulls a huge joyful smile across his grizzled face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He then smears his hand over his mug, pulling the smile off his face and rubbing it on Bloom's mouth. When he takes his hand away, Bloom plays along and has the same big joyful smile. The old man winks at him and walks back to his broom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As soon as the old man is away, Bloom drops the smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stephen paces out into the street.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We missed the sunrise. That would've been nice.

</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
They walk across the street to the Tiergarten.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TIERGARTEN - EARLY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Berlin's Central Park and zoo, dead and brown. The brothers stroll through the woods, Stephen a few steps ahead, Bloom trailing behind, lost in thought.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Camel heads poke over a wall with `Kamelhaus' painted on it. Stephen throws open the wall's gate.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
(to camels)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Back to the swamps!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
The camels are unimpressed. Bloom slouches into a bench.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stephen shows the deck of cards to Bloom, who nods. Stephen cuts the deck, shows him a card. Bloom shakes his head, no.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At least you're honest.

Bloom stares into space.

<STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright, let's do this. Let's just get it done. So first you say `I'm quitting, Stephen. I'm out.' Then I say...

</STEPHEN>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	`Do we have to go through this again.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then you make a show of putting on your jacket and say `no I mean it this time Stephen, this time I'm really out.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then you say `let's have a drink, and in the morning Bloom you'll have come to your senses'
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
Stephen pulls a flask, unscrews it.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
(re: Bloom's bright red blood stain)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a major design flaw in fake blood, by the way.

</STEPHEN>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	`and we'll be moving on.'

<STEPHEN>

</STEPHEN>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen to me.

</BLOOM>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<BLOOM>

Bloom bats the flask away. A camel catches it, tips its camel neck back and gulps it down.

	That's my new favorite camel.

</STEPHEN>
<BLOOM>

Stephen listens.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't wake up next to another stranger, who thinks they know me, or even wants to know me, cause I don't know - who - I'm thirty five years old, and I, I'm useless, I'm crippled, I don't, I've only ever lived life through these roles that aren't me, that are written for me by you.

</BLOOM>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me what you want.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why? So you can write me a role in a story where I get it? You're not listening to me. I want a real... thing, I wanna do things how I don't know are gonna work out, a, I, want, a...

<BLOOM>

	I'm going away. Somewhere you or even the Chink won't be able to track me down, so don't try. No more stories.

Bloom tosses Stephen the bowler, and storms off. He gets about ten feet, then hesitates.

<BLOOM>

	I love you. Bye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>

The camel nudges Stephen's jacket, looking for more scotch. Stephen puts the bowler on its camel head.

	Sorry bud. I'm dry.

Stephen watches his brother walk off into the rising morning mist, lost in thought.

Beautiful green hills surround the walled medieval city of Ferentino.
</DIRECTION>

TITLE CARD: Ferentino, Italy - 3 months later.

A tiny red car inches its way across the countryside. It winds its way up and deeper into the city on the hill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FERENTINO APARTMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tiny stone porch outside a private apartment. The red car's bumper pulls up, parks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On a small wood table, empty booze bottles and a loose pack of cards. Fingertips spread the cards, then the fingertips' owner heads for the apartment door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FERENTINO APARTMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stephen steps in cautiously, surveys the apartment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A goddamn mess. Empty bottles and glasses, very little light. Stephen opens the curtains, light streams in the window. A groan of displeasure comes from the gloom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom stirs, passed out in a hammock. Unkept beard, a few extra pounds. Crushed cigar hanging on his lip.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A rotund GRANDMOTHER waddles in, cleaning up bottles and berating Bloom in a constant stream of angry Italian.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's right, you know.

EXT. FERENTINO APARTMENT - LATER

Stephen guides a dressed Bloom out the door. The grandmother follows them, still barking angry Italian at Bloom. At the last moment she says a few kind words, kisses him on the cheek and sends them off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FERENTINO CAFE - DAY

A few tables on a stone walkway overlooking the countryside. The red car parked nearby. Stephen eats, Bloom stares.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A long private road through a tunnel of trees leads to a ludicrous mansion. Our trio watch it from the road.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looks like an etching from a Bronte novel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>

Stephen flips open a first edition Jane Eyre. The illustration inside is in fact an exact match, right down to a plaster deer in the front yard.

<DIRECTION>
Stephen pulls Bloom into the trees as a cherry red Lamborghini roars down the private road, does an unruly donut and crunches painfully into a tree, kicking up a cloud of dust and smoke.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thumping bass from the audio system turns off, and from the dust cloud emerges PENELOPE, early 30s, beautiful but in a non-Lamborghini way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom watches her through the trees, none too happy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THICKET - LATER
</DIRECTION>

Off to the side of the house. They lean on the hood of their rental car, an old school Cadillac.

In the background, a tow truck arrives with a brand new Lamborghini, and leaves towing the old one.

	Controversial choice. So no, is what I'm saying. I'm quits anyway. I'll be in Italy. Drinking.

The front door of the mansion slams, and they watch Penelope drag a harp around into the back yard.

</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
The Chink silently hands Bloom a retractable spyglass, he watches Penelope drift atop a hill and sit on a stump.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's bored, a seed in the snow. We're going to put her through a grand adventure, bring her to life.
	</DIALOGUE>

Bloom doesn't take his spyglass off Penelope.

Penelope plays on.

<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL BAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Very late. Bloom and Stephen in armchairs, collars loosened, drinks drunk. The Chink's Chuck Taylors stick up over the back of a chair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom holds the con flowchart.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and so that's how it ends, in Mexico, a burst of violence then a moment of truth on the beach. What do you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom idly looks over the chart.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've got something up your sleeve. This is about me, right? Somehow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This might not be something you know, but they've all been about you. Maybe that's why they've none of them been perfect, I've never been able to give you what you really want.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to be outta all this. So by definition, this is not going to give me what I want.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
Stephen answers by letting an ace fall from his sleeve.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This will be the last one. You'll let me go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
The Chink's inert sneakers come to life and she's on her feet, silently going to Stephen's side.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will never approach you to do another con again.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to the Chink)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's make it a red Schwinn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom stares at #1 on the flowchart - "BLOOM MEETS PENELOPE."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HILLTOP - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A grumpy Bloom perched on the red Schwinn, an ill fitting Styrofoam helmet on his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stephen sits in a lawn chair watching the highway below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Chink sets up a lawn umbrella, a chair for herself, and a cooler with Coronas.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are less painful ways to cut into a mark.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<STEPHEN>

	Wahk wahk wahk wahk wahk wahk wahk. Score to beat is 7.9. Keep your head in the game, the Chinese judge is tough.

</STEPHEN>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is a banana seat, man!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
He directs this to the Chink, who blinks with innocent incomprehension and opens two Coronas.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't give me that blank look, you know what a fuckin banana seat is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
Stephen spots something and blows a whistle. With a grunt, Bloom launches the Schwinn forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gaining speed, bumping over weeds and gopher holes, down the steep steep hill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the bottom of the hill, a two lane highway. Cruising down the highway, a cherry red Lamborghini.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Whose front right fender Bloom expertly smashes into.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HIGHWAY / SKY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Silent and blue. Time slows to a crawl as Bloom sails through the air, arcing over the Italian luxury car's hood and past a horrified Penelope, face frozen mid scream behind the wheel.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's actually a knack to this. You want to avoid dying or breaking anything that won't grow back, but you don't want to roll out of it and come up roses. If you're trying to fast track into a mark's sympathies, there's nothing quite as efficient as having your first conversation be from a hospital bed they put you in. I usually like to try for a dislocated shoulder.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
Several things happen at once.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom hits the pavement shoulder-first, hard. The bent bike follows suit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Up on the hill, Stephen and the Chink raise score cards. 8.9 and 5.6.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Lamborghini screeches to a stop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everything is still.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then the car jolts forward. Then stops. Then again, jolts and stops. Rolls forward a few feet, lazily drifting, then jolts and stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom painfully stands, as confused by the car's behavior as us.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stephen and the Chink lower their cards, equally confused.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One last long beat of silence, then the car jolts forward, veers drunkenly to the left, tips into a ditch and chunks to a stop. The horn blares.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom looks up to the hilltop for guidance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stephen stares blankly. The Chink raises a new score card - 7.8.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Penelope sleeps, bruised and battered. Bloom sits bedside uncomfortably, arm in a wimpy sling. She stirs. Bloom leans forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slurred with sleep and drugs, she painfully barely breathes
</DIRECTION>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you alright?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom consults with Stephen and the Chink, both in scrubs.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Chink had it - I'm telling him, I know, thank you - in her report, I missed it. This is actually kind of great, I'll tell you why.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
The Chink lights a cigarette.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You missed it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dostoevsky was an epileptic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His seizures were preceded by an enlightened euphoria, a sort of opening of his spiritual eye. I think the fact that she saw your face the instant before a seizure is a pretty goddamn good foot to start things out on, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom stares blankly. The Chink burps into her stethoscope.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom slumps in a chair, watching Penelope sleep.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The next step is to figure out a way to insinuate yourself into their personal life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom drifts off, then wakes with a start.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is MORNING. Penelope is shaking him.
</DIRECTION>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think they took my car. Could you drive me home?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<DIRECTION>
BLOOM
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh. Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She walks away, the back of her gown wide open, then turns.
</DIRECTION>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm Penelope Stamp.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<DIRECTION>
BLOOM

INT. CADILLAC - MORNING

Bloom drives, Penelope gazes stiffly out the window.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>

	Engagement. Find a connection with your mark through conversation.

PENELOPE

	S' ok.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. He notices her playing with the side mirror knob, angling it to stare at him while looking out the window.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice area.

<DIRECTION>

More silence.

<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This car is like riding in a huge marshmallow.

And still more silence.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. LUDICROUS MANSION - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They pull up in the car. A tow truck is dropping off a new Lamborghini.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get invited in for coffee, and tell them the full tale.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom looks about to launch into something, when Penelope drops a stack of cash bound in a green rubber band on his dashboard.
</DIRECTION>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For the bike, and the whole, thing. This was a big shit sandwich. Ok. Bye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<DIRECTION>
The car door slams and she's gone. Bloom sits a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	However, there are advantages to playing it cool. Letting it lie for a day or two, then casually re- establish contact.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom starts driving off, and adjusts the passenger side mirror so it points back to the road. As he does he sees Penelope in it, sprinting after his car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stops. A moment later she appears at his window, heaving.
</DIRECTION>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I realized... I should have... invited you in... for coffee... right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PENELOPE'S KITCHEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom and Penelope sit in a luxurious stone-based kitchen, neither touching their coffee. Bloom talks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is how Penelope listens: she starts with her eyes on Bloom, then very quickly drifts away into her own thoughts, then recognizes she's doing it and makes eye contact again and gives an overbaked "oh yes go on" smile/nod, then does it all again. Three or four times.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...didn't really have anyone except each other growing up, and our father was in the antique business, he had a shop in Charleston. So we stuck together, my brother Stephen and me, we and just took over the shop when dad died. Then we realized one day, we saw the dealers who were finding and selling us the antiques coming from exotic countries all over the world, and there was a, almost a scent they had, when they'd come in the dusty shop we worked nine to five in since we were nineteen, the air would, like before a rain, the ions would line up, and you could just smell midnight trains to Paris and steamer ships and Calcutta bazaars, and we made the decision, we just did it, that we want to have that sort of life. So we did, and we've been travelling and treasure hunting the world ever since, and could you, I'm sorry, stop doing - that, you're, I'm, ok. Alright, look.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm really bad at talking to people.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<BLOOM>

	I told you, that's alright. You want me to go?

</BLOOM>
<PENELOPE>

	No! I want to talk to you. Fuck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>

She storms out.

<DIRECTION>
INT. PARLOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Victorian, expensive. Penelope leans against the window, looking out. Sulking. Bloom enters.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what kind of stuff do you do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing. Maybe you should go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright. I'm just gonna finish my coffee first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
Very slowly, he sips it. Each sip becomes a noisier and noisier slurp.
</DIRECTION>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I collect hobbies. I see someone doing something I like, and I get books and learn how to do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hm. Anything interesting?

HOBBY MONTAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In which Penelope demonstrates the following with exacting seriousness and skill for Bloom:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Playing the piano. The classical guitar. The fiddle. The banjo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Putting the finishing touches on a ship in a bottle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Executing a perfect ollie on a skateboard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Juggling various items. Riding a unicycle. Juggling while riding a unicycle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Playing ping-pong against a wall with ungodly speed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Karate chopping through too much wood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Breakdancing.

Rapping to a drum machine.

Creating a perfect origami dragon.

On Bloom's shell-shock face.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I know a lot of stuff.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You just learned this stuff, here by yourself?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kinda sad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. So you just thought, `so I want to learn this and this,' and you just did it? How do you plan to use all these skills?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I dunno. I'm not a planner. I just do stuff. Here, look at this watermelon. It's a camera. You can make a pinhole camera out of anything hollowish and dark.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's gotta warp the image though, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, yeah it does. That's what - the Taj Majal taken by a fat tourist with diarrhea and a point- and-shoot camera can be the flattest, dullest, "here's us at the Taj Majal," "Oh lovely lets go stick our thumbs up our asses" picture. But you can look at the most menial everyday thing, and depending on how your pinhole camera eats the light, it's warped and peculiar and imperfect. It's not reproduction, it's storytelling.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a lie that tells the truth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I dunno about truth. A photograph is a secret about a secret. The more it tells you, the less you know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's changed between now and twenty minutes ago? Cause this is kinda like a conversation.

	Huh. Well shit.

EXT. BACKYARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom and Penelope walk and talk, finally rounding the house and ending up at the driveway.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I should, uh, it's late. So. I meet a lot of people in my job I have to professionally act interested in. It's a good feeling to be genuinely interested in someone.

	Well next time I'm in town. We're taking a steamer at noon tomorrow off the docks, to the continent for a few months.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
During this, Bloom very naturally moves his hand to the small of Penelope's back. The edge of his thumb comes to rest on a small slit of exposed skin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Penelope's expression does not change, but a noticeable blush crosses her still face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When Bloom removes his hand, the blush falls.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Paris and Greece, I think. I've gotta get a hat. Thanks for the pinhole camera demonstration. And for the good conversation. Goodbye Penelope.

He drives off. She stands in the doorway, watching him go.

EXT. THE DOCKS - DAY

A jaunty steamer ship docked and ready. Bloom watches the access road, Stephen makes notes, the Chink whittles.

	I need another day with her.

	You'll have two weeks on the boat.

</STEPHEN>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need another day to get her on the boat, she isn't hooked. That bit I skipped where we were talking in the backyard, it was ten minutes on the optics of lensless photography, we didn't really talk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It isn't the talking that hooked her.

<DIRECTION>
Bloom turns from the road.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you're wrong.

A screech of distant tires and a crash. Bloom doesn't look.

Penelope pulls a clumsy steamer trunk that never could have fit in her Lamborghini, which is bent around a pylon.

Bloom meets her.

EXT. DECK - NIGHT

Several small tables scattered about the moonlit deck, Bloom and Penelope sit with flutes of champagne. Penelope, in an elegant but understated dress, shuffles a pack of cards.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>

	When I turned six I started getting allergies, hayfever, rashes, really bad. So my mom took me into the doctor, and he did that test where they use needles to prick a grid on your back with all the different toxins, to see which ones you're allergic to. The next day I came in, the doctor lifted up my shirt, and my back looked like a patch of oily, moldy, blackish green double- puff marshmallows. I was allergic to everything. So they sealed the house with plastic and a special ventilation system, and I spent my entire childhood and adolescence indoors. Mostly alone. Lonely.

She pulls the Queens out of the deck and lays them face up on the table.

	Wow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It wasn't `til I was nineteen they discovered what I was actually allergic to was the aluminum alloy the hypodermic needle was made out of. Then I was going to leave, but my mom got sick. So I stayed. And she stayed sick, a long time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you feel cheated?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
Penelope does an amazing card trick using the four queens.
</DIRECTION>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The trick to not feeling cheated is to learn how to cheat. So I decided this wasn't a story about a miserable girl trapped in a house that smelled like medical supplies wasting her life on a dying person she sometimes hated. It was about a girl who could find infinite beauty in anything, any little thing. And do anything she decided to do. And love the person she was trapped with. So I told myself that story until it became true. Now did doing that let me escape a wasted life, or did it just blind me so I wouldn't want to escape it? I don't know. But either way, I was the one telling my own story. So I don't feel cheated.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<DIRECTION>
She finishes the trick.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A single pair of hands clapping turns their heads. At the far end of the deck, alone at a table, the large man in the fur collared cape, who for reasons unlikely to become clear at the moment will be called THE CURATOR.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_CURATOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And a magician is just an actor playing the part of a magician. My compliments.

Bloom takes Penelope gently by the elbow and guides her up and away.

He leaves her alone. Clouds obscure the moon, shadows deepen. She shivers.
</DIRECTION>

A match strikes. She jumps.

The moon re-emerges, and she is no longer alone on the deck. The Curator lights a dapper briar pipe, shakes out the match.

<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It isn't a Spanish band, but they'll do their best.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
He hands her a single blood red rose. She puts it in her teeth, and they dance. If there is a tinge of tension in the air, the Bolero suits it.

The moon ducks behind a cloud once more, and they dance on in the dark.
</DIRECTION>

INT. STATE ROOM - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom wakes with a start. Morning light pours in through his porthole. He opens it, looks out to sea.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His dinner jacket draped over a chair. The rose in its lapel. He fishes it out. Runs his fingers over the teeth marks on the stem.

Then raises an eyebrow at a lump in the breast pocket, and pulls out the stack of bills in the green rubber band.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Administrative offices. So how do you steal the book?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<THE_CURATOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The book is already stolen. The stealing is in the bureaucracy, in the filing, red tape. As far as the museum is concerned, the book does not exist. I am the curator, I walk in, pinch the copy girl's baboosh, put the book in a briefcase and walk out. Tomorrow, say, at two.

Memories of his daughter's hand in his, flashing against the sun.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_CURATOR>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wanted that the world was alive in the most fantastic way for her. To built her a pair of wings. Make these things real. But maybe more than any other objet d'art, she loved to hear she'd ask to hear the story of the stone golem. From a painting in a small private collection on the island of Ikaria.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_CURATOR>
<DIRECTION>
He motions to the painting, and we move into it. As he tells the story the scenes are shown in the painting, just as still images, which we move across like a picture book.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_CURATOR>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well Rachel, like most monsters the Golem was once a human. A boy, about your age. And one day the boy was walking home, and he quarrelled, he fought, with a good friend of his. They got very angry and his friend pushed him a certain way and the boy fell and struck his head and died. The boy's friend was very sad but also very frightened. So instead of telling the boy's parents, he did something awful. He pulled the body into a quarry, a pit of broken rocks, and hid the boy beneath a pile of large stones. Well. Years went by, and the boy's friend became a young man, and one day while drinking in town
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(which in his guilt he did quite a lot of)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	he heard that a well was being built near the forest... with the stones from the quarry. He ran to the quarry to find it nearly empty... no stones, no body. He ran to the well where the masons were finishing their work. `Did they find anything strange in the quarry?' he asked, expecting, maybe hoping they'd arrest him for the awful crime on the spot. But no, they said, motioning to the well. Nothing strange. Just stones. They left him alone there at the well, and he stood looking into it as the sun fell behind the mountains and twilight set the world in a deep, still silence.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_CURATOR>
<DIRECTION>
The last image we land on is the well, alone in the clearing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Its dark innards loom ominously in the long pregnant silence that follows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, with a piercing ROAR, a living monster of stone lunges out of the well, animated and terrifying, grabs the friend by the throat and with a crunching of bones and one last roar pulls him back down into the depths of the well.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Silence again. We pull out of the painting, back to the Curator, sitting very still.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_CURATOR>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My daughter died nineteen years ago today. She was six. She went out to play one afternoon and vanished. The next morning we found her, in a stone well on a neighboring property. I climbed down to her, but slipped and broke my leg, and while we waited for the rescue team to pull us out she died in my arms. If you've had a child... my whole everything just focused down to one thing, to hold her and make her feel safe. But no matter what I said to her, I couldn't stop her shaking, crying. Her last moments on this earth were filled with terror. Of a stone golem.

He stands, opens the blinds, pours another drink.

	<DIALOGUE>
	It's been a funny thing, watching you boys take what I taught you and eclipse me. I'm so proud to be a footnote in the lives of the Brothers Bloom. And you hate me. The curse of all bad fathers - that my presence on this earth after I die will not live on the lips of admiring men, but will sink into the murky backwaters of my children's psyches.

He does, but Bloom's fingers don't loosen on the pencil.
</DIRECTION>
<DIAMOND_DOG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But love, you know. We know, folks like us, you can always blink and realize that it's a fiction, and like Peter walking on water or Wiley Coyote running off a cliff, if you look down in doubt you'll fall. That's the price of our lives, the wax in our wings. One day Stephen's going to fall. It may be glorious, but he's going to fall hard and he won't be there to tell you what to do and protect you. When he's gone, remember me.

The Dog has moved in very close to Bloom, his breath hot on his face, and his hand comes to rest fully on Bloom's leg.

Bloom's hand with the pencil quivers, about to strike-

Bloom flops into bed. He turns and looks at the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Right on the other side of it...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PENELOPE'S HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Penelope lies in bed, looking at the wall also. She closes her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BLOOM'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom's breathing slows. He closes his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. Then light snoring breaks the silence, coming through the wall. Penelope snoring.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom smiles slightly. What a cute snore.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The snoring deepens slightly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The clock on the wall advances from 1:30am to 5:50am, and through the window the horizon glows with the approach of dawn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom lies wide awake on his back, red rimmed eyes wide open, the guttural snoring ringing in his ears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. APARTMENT STAIRCASE - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Our four at the Curator's door. Bloom knocks, and they all step judiciously back. No response.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Max?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're a little early...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE CURATOR'S APARMENT - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Still and silent in the breaking light of morning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And totally empty. Picked clean down to the bare walls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The only thing left in the apartment is the painting of the well... broken on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Our intrepid four stand in various states of thoughtfulness. Penelope stares at the painting, Bloom at the window.
</DIRECTION>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Golem came for him. In my dream. Crawled out of the painting and killed him in a horrible way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well at least he had the decency to just skip out on us, not do something tacky like fake his own death.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
Poking around the room, Bloom opens a closet. The Curator stands pressed against the back wall in his pajamas.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_CURATOR>
<DIRECTION>
(sotto)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a little early.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_CURATOR>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom quickly closes it.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't get it. If he was hightailing it he could have waited eight hours till we traded the million for the book, and had some traveling money. Well. Back to antiquing. Nothing gained, nothing lost.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Penelope)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you got to see Prague, which is nice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
Penelope's eyes widen with realization.
</DIRECTION>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should stay in the city for awhile, they have these amazing puppet show opera things-
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>

But Stephen raises a hand to shut him up.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SIDEWALK BAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Several empty glasses of wine, one full one in Penelope's hand. All heads are slumped.
</DIRECTION>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's my fault. I can't believe I left you alone with him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
The Chink hands Stephen a piece of paper. He glances at it.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The check was cashed yesterday afternoon, he'd have deposited it in a Swiss account. I'm sorry Pen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What a waste.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom puts his hand on her arm, sympathetic.
</DIRECTION>
<PENELOPE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That poor man. What a waste.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom's expression turns quizzical.
</DIRECTION>
<PENELOPE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That poor Argentina man. He'll never see the book now, it'll just rot in the catacombs. What a waste.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<DIRECTION>
When Penelope lifts her suddenly brightened eyes in a moment of divine inspiration, Bloom meets her gaze with fear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CHARLES BRIDGE, PRAGUE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom paces, Penelope looks up at the castle with binoculars. The Chink and Stephen stand by.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. No no. Can't you see what happened here, there is no book, we've been swindled -
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But maybe there is, maybe it's real, we don't know!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not real, it's a con.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's my money, I'm going to find out for sure. He gave us every piece of information we need.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<DIRECTION>
She spreads the castle floor plan out on a bench.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom turns to Stephen and the Chink with a "this is crazy right?" expression and gesture. They give him nothing back.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'd need to clear the administrative offices. Some sort of disruption.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
The Chink strokes her chin in mock-thoughtfulness.
</DIRECTION>
<PENELOPE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Bloom)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon. Help me break into this castle. It'll be fun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FIELD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Barbie Doll set up in the middle of the field explodes in a theatrical plume of fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Several others follow suit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Chink pops up from behind a mound of dirt in her aviator goggles, cigarette dangling from her lip. She leans on a detonator plunger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom, Stephen and Penelope crouch nearby, watching her work.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's an artist with nitroglycerin. It's kind of her thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I feel like I want to know more about her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	BLOOM STEPHEN
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Yeah. Yeah.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Check the tat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
On the back of the Chink's neck, a few finely scripted lines of Chinese.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	An inky wisp of personal information. We transcribed it, brought it into a Chinese restaurant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's it say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The literal translation is something about water cranes, but essentially it means "When you're done with something, blow it up."
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PENELOPE'S PRAGUE HOTEL ROOM - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Chink lies on the floor with Penelope, showing her how to build a tiny remotely detonated bomb. She slices a tiny bit off a brick of dynamite, sets it in a petri dish with a detonator, and puts the whole thing in a handbag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Penelope appreciates her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom and Stephen hunker over the castle floorplan.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's a smoke detector in these empty rooms in the east tower. So we plant and set off a tiny -
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to the Chink)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	TINY tiny, tiny charge.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
The Chink clicks a seemingly innocent ballpoint pen. With a BEEP, a tiny poof of fire plumes from the handbag setting it on fire, and the smoke rises to the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fire drill ensues, offices empty, and you'll have exactly four and a half minutes to get through the access hatch, into the catacombs, get the book and get out before the fire department arrives.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
Penelope and the Chink do their elaborate handshake, and she gives Stephen and Bloom a finger snap thumbs up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PENELOPE'S HOTEL ROOM - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom and Penelope, up late at the table. Going over the floorplan one more time.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So straight down the corridor, again, tell me where.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Second left, third right, access hatch behind the copier, I need to sleeeeeeep...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The abort code if we need to abort is "corned beef." For some reason.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bloom, I need to sleep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<DIRECTION>
He folds up the plans, she wraps up the brick of dynamite and bomb components and spots a black leather backpack beside an open handbag on the table.
</DIRECTION>
<PENELOPE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this Yeungling's backpack?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
She gently puts the brick of stabilized nitroglycerin inside the front zipper compartment, and sets the tiny petri-dish bomb beside the handbag.
</DIRECTION>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what I feel?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Horny?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Scared. All my big talk. But this isn't a story, it's real. Fuckin scary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<DIRECTION>
She kisses him. He kisses her back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pure whole hearted sensuality with which they attack each other and the deluge of almost child-like need let loose in this one simple act quickly reaches a point where as a viewer we no longer feel comfortable intruding with our gaze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fifteen seconds after this point, we FADE OUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PRAGUE - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sun arcs into the sky above the castle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PENELOPE'S PRAGUE HOTEL ROOM - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom half wakes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across the landscape of the bed, Penelope sleeps. Sunlight on her body and her sleeping face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Distant KNOCKING. From the next room over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom's eyes snap open. He scampers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PRAGUE HOTEL WINDOW LEDGE - DAWN CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In his boxers, holding trousers and shirt in his teeth, Bloom swings over the ledge from Penelope's window into his.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BLOOM'S PRAGUE HOTEL ROOM - DAWN CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He opens the door for Stephen, who regards him narrowly.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ready?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PENELOPE'S PRAGUE HOTEL ROOM - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Chink picks up the backpack, handbag and petri dish bomb.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PENELOPE'S PRAGUE HOTEL ROOM - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Penelope folds a plastic bag and puts it under her jacket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CASTLE ADJACENT STREETS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A little alcove with a good view of the castle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stephen trains his gaze on one set of windows high in the Eastern tower. Bloom paces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EASTERN TOWER ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An empty storage room, half under construction. The Chink walks in, wearing the backpack and carrying the handbag. She goes straight for a spot just under a smoke detector.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CASTLE ADJACENT STREETS - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stephen, Bloom and Penelope are joined by the Chink.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ok.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
He looks through his binoculars again.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ok.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<DIRECTION>
They share a brief moment with their eyes, and Penelope trots off. The Chink caught it. She looks at Bloom slyly.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For the record, I'm still against this. Why send her in alone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
The Chink finds a way to casually smell Bloom's fingers.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because going in alone is a very important thing to do. She's walking into a zero security tourism office during a fire drill and taking a five hundred dollar manuscript replica from a utility crawlspace. Worst case scenario, a file clerk asks if she's lost. Which isn't even going to happen.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to the Chink)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's in position.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
He spots Penelope casually waiting beside an unmarked door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom notices the Chink looking at him with a knowing grin. She mimes sealing her lips and tossing the key.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She then takes the ballpoint pen detonator... out of the handbag dangling at her hip.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cause nobody's going to know we were ever here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom spots the handbag. Something's not right.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh-
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
The Chink clicks the pen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EASTERN TOWER ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The black backpack, sitting under the smoke alarm, beeps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CASTLE ADJACENT STREETS - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A THUNDEROUS EXPLOSION blows a massive ten foot wide chunk out of the side of the Eastern tower, spewing a painfully dramatic ball of fire and debris.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Screams. Shouts. Panic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Our three look up at the tower, agape.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_CHINK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_CHINK>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom grabs the binoculars from Stephen, looks for Penelope.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Panicked tourists stumble away from the descending dust. Penelope sees what's happened, but holds her ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The unmarked door opens, and a dozen business people pour out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

EXT. CASTLE ADJACENT STREETS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom drops the binoculars and sprints.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A burly SECURITY GUARD trots across the courtyard, herding tourists and smoking a cigar.
</DIRECTION>
<SECURITY_GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To ze back, no panic, to ze back...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECURITY_GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
He blocks the office door, and sets his cigar down for a moment. Penelope spots it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CASTLE ADJACENT STREETS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom nears the courtyard, sees Penelope up ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pen! Don't - abort! Corned beef! Corned beef!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Penelope deftly spins the cigar 180 degrees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Guard absently picks it up and puts it back in his mouth, fire-side first. He howls, doubles over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She dashes into the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom bursts out of the crowd and lunges for the door, but a SECOND SECURITY GUARD stops him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dozens more security guards swarm in. Overhead, an army helicopter buzzes by. Bloom stares into the doorway, helpless and scared.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TOURISM OFFICE HALLWAYS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Water rains down from the ceiling sprinklers. Penelope weaves through the halls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COPY ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cramped, ill lit, and with its own sprinkler.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Penelope dashes in, shoulders the massive cold war era copy machine and with a Herculean effort pulls it away from the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm in Prague. I burned a man's lips off to break into a castle in Prague.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<DIRECTION>
Revealing an access hatch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CRAWLSPACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tiny, earthy. Penelope shuts the hatch behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Light from a barred window illuminates a rectangular shape lying on a stone slab. Penelope approaches the small BOOK OF HOURS reverently.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CHARLES BRIDGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A full view of the castle reveals just about the worst case scenario. The entire area swarms with army helicopters and tanks, soldiers with rifles, yellow tape, news crews.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stephen, Bloom and the Chink sit behind the police line on the bridge with the rest of the crowds. Heads in their hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CRAWLSPACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Penelope is broken out of her stupor by heavy footsteps all around her, soldiers searching the castle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Voices right outside the hatch. She slides the wimpy little bolt shut. It rattles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks up - a moldy vent in the muddy ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CHARLES BRIDGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom suddenly stands.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait. Wait, we're fine. She's fine. If the soldiers find her wandering the halls they'll assume she's a clerk, they'll just shoo her out. So as long as she doesn't do anything suspicious, she's fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VENTILATION DUCT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Penelope wriggles on her belly through a tin ventilation duct barely big enough for her. The book, encased in the plastic bag, hangs from her teeth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sounds of soldiers searching the offices come from below her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Up ahead she sees a point of light. With a gleeful grunt she shimmies faster - she's nearly made it!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TOURISM OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A dozen SOLDIERS and the CHIEF OF POLICE have their eyes (and guns) trained on the tin ventilation duct above their heads.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is very very obvious not only that a person is crawling through it, but exactly where that person is.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Chief of Police pointedly coughs to get her attention.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VENTILATION DUCT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Penelope freezes. A beat of silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tin gives way, and she plummets...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TOURISM OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...hitting the ground hard, then springing to her feet and through some knee-jerk primal instinct kicking a nearby soldier in the head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eleven rifles cock and aim at her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And that's how she's caught, frozen in a kung fu stance, plastic bag in her teeth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She locks eyes with the Chief of Police. Lets the bag drop from her teeth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And opens her mouth to speak.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CHARLES BRIDGE - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hubbub has died down considerably, soldiers march away from the castle in formation. Bloom Stephen and the Chink sit watching for some sign.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Three police cars, sirens blazing, drive down the length of the bridge.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Chief of Police.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
As the last one passes, Bloom sees the Chief of Police riding shotgun, and Penelope sitting with a soldier behind caged mesh in the back seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His face falls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then Penelope spots him, points and says something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Very suddenly, the police car stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Chief of Police gets out. Nods at our intrepid three.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And opens the door for Penelope. As she climbs out he motions for the passing soldiers to stand at attention and salute her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He kisses her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<CHIEF_OF_POLICE>

She blushes and smiles, then does an unhurried victory strut back to Bloom, Stephen and the Chink.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The police cars drive off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Penelope pulls the book out from under her jacket and sets it on a bench. A moment of victorious silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clapping her hands, she does a little shuffle dance of joy.

EXT. PARK - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom walks pensively through a green park. Cat Stevens' "Miles from Nowhere" plays from a nearby radio.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His eye catches something. A shiny red apple on a fruit seller's cart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He approaches it slowly, face flushed, breath shallow, eyeing the elderly vendor with a thin semblance of nonchalance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holy shit. He is going to steal that apple.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Deftly he passes, lifting and pocketing it just as the Vendor turns away. Bloom has done it. His pale face tightens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And turns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And sees a five year old boy. Giving him a stare of infinite judgement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom turns on his heel and RUNS HELL FOR LEATHER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The vendor shouts. The little boy chases him, pointing and screaming. Dogs bark. People stare. And Bloom sprints, apple in hand, a joyful smile forming on his lips.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Stephen pokes his head into Penelope's car, says goodnight.

As soon as he's gone, a foot dangles down outside the window and taps it. Penelope pulls it open, Bloom shimmies in with two mini bottles of gin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He kisses her.

<DIRECTION>
Bloom holds a sleeping Penelope, watching the sun stream through the window and slipping the green rubber band cash into her suitcase.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A low horn blows, and Bloom's face darkens.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE ATLANTIC OCEAN - DAY

<DIRECTION>
The good ship Fidele breaks the waves, blowing its horn.

Stephen stands on the deck. Bloom joins him.

He strolls off, leaving Bloom watching the horizon gloomily.

EXT. DECK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Our intrepid four sit around a small table (except for the Chink, who lies on a deck chair in a bikini and Chuck Taylors, sunning herself.)
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh-kay. We're rendezvousing with Senor Rioso's guys here, on an isolated beach just south of the Mexican port town Tampico. A simple handoff. Penelope and Yeungling will stay with the car, Bloom and I will do the handing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You guys seem a little tense.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well I'm not thrilled they set this in Mexico. There could be legitimate reasons, but Mexico's - and I don't want to simplistically vilify an entire country, but Mexico's a horrible place. So we'll be careful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MEXICO BEACH - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Chink fires an automatic pistol eight times into the dead center of a target pinned to a palm tree. She re-loads.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TAMPICO HOTEL GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The beach sprawling below them, Penelope and Bloom meander.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hotel itself feels very old, red ruinous stone.
</DIRECTION>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this going to be more dangerous than I think, tomorrow?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. You should sleep at the hotel tonight, I'll stay with Stephen at the beach house. You'll need sleep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
On the distant beach, following the faint rapport of gunfire, a palm tree falls over.
</DIRECTION>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm really happy right now. Are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right now I am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
She kisses him and runs off along the cliff side, singing the smuggler song.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Penelope...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
But she's too far away now, and the ocean is too loud. She can't hear him, and he can't hear her, and in another moment she has vanishes into the green brush and white flowers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind Bloom's pained face, the sun dips towards the beach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stephen packs for tomorrow, Bloom stares out the black window, drinking. Flower in his lapel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stephen picks up the con flowchart.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The last box in our last con. Let them begin the beguine. How's it feel?

</STEPHEN>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's something special, Stephen.

	Uh huh.

</STEPHEN>
<BLOOM>

He stares at his drink.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I just have a little more time? Just a few days. I want to keep her, like this, I don't want this to just end. Don't make me do this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be angry at me, you son of a bitch. Don't be pathetic. Make you? Jesus. I told you not to fall for her-
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not gonna do this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
Stephen comes very close to Bloom's face, looks him straight in the eye. Finds his answer.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't believe you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
He goes back to packing.

EXT. TAMPICO HOTEL GROUNDS - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Bloom stands, the beach behind him, the glowing lights of the hotel before him. Growing determination.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT

Bloom knocks on a door. Penelope answers, in her bathrobe.

PENELOPE

Bloom pulls Penelope by the hand, but she stops.
</DIRECTION>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bloom. What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<DIRECTION>
Deep breath.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My brother and I are con men. All things considered, we might be the most respected con man team working today. And everything since you hit me with your Lamborghini, all of this, it's all fake. It's all a con.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BEACH - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The waves break angrily on the beach. In the distance, Stephen finishes his drink on the beach house porch, goes inside and turns out the light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TAMPICO HOTEL GROUNDS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, we were going to blow you off tomorrow using the cackle bladder, it's a, term, we have actors playing the Argentina guy's men, when we showed up the deal would go bad, they would open fire on us, Stephen and I would pretend to be shot using blood packets, squibs. That's - cackle bladder, in the old days they put fake blood in chicken bladders, so... So you'd escape with the Chink, she'd send you off with a little travelling money and that would be that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But that's not how this one's going to end. I love you now, and I want to get you out of this. I'm going to do what I have to do to get you out of this, away from all this for good. Are you ready?

</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BEACH - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom leads Penelope down the beach by the hand.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stephen's gone into town to prep the Argentina actors. Your money's at his place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Money? I don't want the money, let's just leave.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment he's tempted. The dark beach house looms ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dark. Bloom leads Penelope in, stumbles in the dark, switches on a lamp. Click, click - it doesn't come on.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have to switch it on at the base.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. Bloom does.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stephen sits in an easy chair, not looking happy. But not angry. Much more sad than angry.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So I've told her our whole play. And I'm here. To take her money back. How's that make you feel?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Disappointed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This isn't the ending you wanted?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It doesn't matter now. This is the way it ends. So let's get it over with.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's the money?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I ate it.

</STEPHEN>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>

</BLOOM>
<STEPHEN>

	I don't want the money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's not going to keep a single piece of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
Stephen stands.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry you fell in love with her. But she's a mark. And all of this, all of it is a con. Every moment you shared with her, you were just playing the part of a man falling in love. That's what you're afraid of, right? That you don't know the difference? Or maybe that there is no difference. That that's what love is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're leaving.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
(to Bloom)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. You're too scared to leave. You're scared to ride off into a sunset that isn't painted tarpaulin, cause real sunsets are beautiful but they turn into dark uncertain nights. If you were ready for that, you wouldn't be here. The money is in my bedroom. Right behind me. But in my story you don't get the money or the sunset or the girl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
A long beat. The dark bedroom doorway looms behind Stephen.
</DIRECTION>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bloom. Let's just go. Please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom LUNGES, cracking Stephen in the jaw.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stephen goes down, Bloom leaps past him - but Stephen grabs Bloom's leg and brings him down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then they are fighting. Penelope watches, horrified.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A frightening, brutal brawl that tears the small beach house apart, thirty years worth of a fight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Until Stephen throws Bloom to the ground at Penelope's feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Upsetting a small table. The Chink's pistol, lying on the holey paper target, falls and strikes the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And goes off with a deafening rapport.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blood spreads just beneath Stephen's collarbone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Penelope screams.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stephen stays standing for a moment, shocked. A dribble of blood out of the corner of his mouth. He half grins.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tastes like tin foil.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
And sinks to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom's eyes glaze. He crawls to his brother. Takes him in his arms.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
Penelope watches the brothers holding each other. Tears in her eyes, but she backs away a step, very conscious of not being a part of this moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom looks up at her, almost taking a moment to recognize her.
</DIRECTION>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bloom...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<DIRECTION>
He doesn't move from his brother.
</DIRECTION>
<PENELOPE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<DIRECTION>
She leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For a long moment the Brothers Bloom lie in each other's arms in the middle of the broken room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then Bloom stands, goes to the window and watches Penelope walking off into the distance down the beach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the darkened bedroom doorway steps the Chink, her face a mask.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stephen stands. Lifts his shirt and removes the squib and blood packets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom steps outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A wood patio with steps leading down to the sand. Bloom watches Penelope, now very distant, almost gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stephen comes out, pulls out a flask.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(nothing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think that was the most honest conversation we've ever had.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(more nothing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You actually connected on a few of those punches.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you expect me to do it? To come here tonight, end it the way you wrote it? Or were you really disappointed I didn't run off with her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was disappointed. But I wasn't surprised.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom turns and SLUGS him in the jaw. Stephen falls to the sand.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I let you do your monologue, but you wanna know why I did it? I did it so she'd never want to see me again. To get her away from all this for good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
Without looking back Bloom walks off down the beach, in the opposite direction of Penelope, leaving Stephen bleeding in the sand, alone in the dark uncertain night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT.

EXT. LUDICROUS MANSION - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Penelope's home, bucolic on a lazy Spring day.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At a picnic table at the far edge of the front lawn, Penelope sits writing with intense concentration on a piece of paper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After awhile she raises her head, regarding what she's written thoughtfully. Folds it up, puts it in her pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clicks the seemingly innocent ballpoint pen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEEP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The mansion EXPLODES, completely.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She walks away without looking back.

After a beat, the plaster deer explodes in a ridiculous fireball.

EXT. ITALIAN COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

Green hills surround the walled medieval city of Ferentino. A tiny white car inches its way across the countryside, and up into the city.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. FERENTINO APARTMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom walks up the stone alley to his apartment, a bag of groceries in hand. He spots the white car parked out front.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Loud shouting in Italian grows louder, until Penelope and the Grandmother burst out the front door. Berating each other with Italian curses and hand gestures.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Penelope sees Bloom, and freezes.

The Grandmother keeps up her barrage as she takes the groceries from Bloom, but as soon as she's behind Penelope's back she gives Bloom a wink, points to her and gives a thumbs- up of approval.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't even know she had one.

	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<DIRECTION>
She takes a piece of paper from her pocket, unfolds it and slides it across the table to him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On it, written over and over in a dozen different stylized fonts, is "PENELOPE THE CON ARTIST."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom sets the paper down with a snap.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go away. Everything Stephen said was true. I was just playing you as a mark. Everything between us, none of it was real.

She leans in close to him, her hand on his leg.

Lush, Edwardian. In a private room, a card table is overturned. Stephen lies on the ground in a defensive posture, a RAVISHING WOMAN in red lunging at him with a curved dagger. A BEARDED MAN with an eyepatch holds her back by the wrists, while a MONOCLED MAN in an antique wheelchair holds his tear stained face in his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This whole scene is frozen like a tableau, as Stephen's cell phone chirps away.

Annoyed, the Bearded Man gives him a `go ahead' nod.

	<DIALOGUE>
	We're obviously not going to deal with real Russians. They'll be our guys in a phony set up, they'll take our phony book and give her phony cash, a closed loop. Safe and simple.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom looks to the Chink for an opinion. Gets a blank face.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So. We go to St. Petersburg.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>

At the mention of St. Petersburg Bloom looks sharply at Stephen, but Stephen presses on.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	She does the hand-off with our fake "Russians." But while we're driving out of town, everything goes bad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
He lays a simple flowchart, drawn on a napkin - three boxes. He points to the first, "Penelope sells book to `Russians'"
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We discover we were sold a counterfeit book in the first place, which we've now sold to Russian smugglers. We discover this when the Russian mob starts taking us out one by one. Oh shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
He points to the second box, "Red Dawn."
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First they ambush our car, destroying the money. Then they take me out, then the Chink, and finally you Bloom, in a heroic death that allows Penelope to barely escape with her life. Devastated but reborn with the knowledge that you loved her so much you died so she could live, she drives off into a romantic life of adventure and peril, on the run from imaginary Russians.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>

He points to the third box, "The End."

</BLOOM>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We need someone who can pass for the Russian mob to buy our fake book. The Dog's got his big store right here in St. Petersburg.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright, fuckin stop. You want this to finish in St. Petersburg, you want this to end with the Dog for some what thematic something? Fine but don't tell it like a story, let's say it. Twenty three years ago and I can still smell, that blood red apartment of his, the smell of that place. I hate him Stephen but this isn't that, this is I don't trust him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's he gonna do? Steal our fake money?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Impressive, boys.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIAMOND_DOG>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's trash. There's visible cross hatching in Franklin's eye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
Sure enough - obvious jagged misprints cut into Ben Franklin's eye on the bills.
</DIRECTION>
<DIAMOND_DOG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hm. I'll be damned.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(closes case)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ruskies wouldn't be caught dead handing over a rag bag like this, it should be a steel attache.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIAMOND_DOG>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This'll do. We'll do the drop off at your store. Make it scary, think a movie version of the Russian mafia, but don't hassle her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIAMOND_DOG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIAMOND_DOG>
<DIRECTION>
The Dog closes the case, and for a moment Bloom's eyes rest on his bandaged hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He then takes the case and quickly moves off with his crew.
</DIRECTION>
<DIAMOND_DOG>
<DIRECTION>

INT. HOTEL CAR PORT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Chink leads Stephen and Bloom around the brown Peugeot.

	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
The Chink points with an extendable pointer to a small nub on the rear windshield.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So that one bang, then we roll off the road. Once we get clear of the car the Chink sets off the final charge, incinerating the car and the money in the trunk. This'll all happen exactly twenty seconds after we cross the main bridge out of town. After the bridge.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
Stephen makes a note in a manila envelope, tucks it in his jacket.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ok.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom and the Chink walk back to their rooms. The Chink is expressionless.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've been awful quiet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
She doesn't react.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm doing this for her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>

But a door clicks shut, and Bloom is alone in the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PENELOPE'S HOTEL ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Penelope in bed. Her door cracks open, and she sleepily looks up. Bloom stands silhouetted in the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tomorrow it all starts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<DIRECTION>
She lifts the sheets. He gets into bed, and as she drifts into peaceful slumber Bloom is very conscious of holding her for the last time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When her snores begin, he has ear plugs ready.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - SUNRISE

<DIRECTION>
EXT. ST. PETERSBURG ALLEY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom, Stephen and the Chink parked in an alley, watching a doorway across the street with a pair of binoculars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom breathes uneasily, checks his watch.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She gives the Dog the book, he gives her the fake money. This is taking too long.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
Just then Penelope trots out. Metal attache case in hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RUSSIA HIGHWAY - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the outskirts of town, parked beside a murky little lake. Our heroes gather around the metal attache case on the hood.
</DIRECTION>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He hassled me. Took forever looking the book over, haggled the price. Wanted to pay me in Rubles.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<DIRECTION>
Stephen smirks, then opens it. The money's there.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright. Let's get the hell out of Russia.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom pulls the Dog's gold lighter from his pocket, takes one last glance at St. Petersburg and tosses it down into the lake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ST. PETERSBURG HIGHWAY - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The brown Peugeot drives towards the climbing sun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PEUGEOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Chink drives, Stephen rides shotgun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom and Penelope in the back seat. He looks weary.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sees the bridge approaching, maybe a half mile ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls his head down into her lap, fingers in his hair. He breathes, closes his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An explosion shatters the front passenger window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom's eyes snap open, he bolts upright.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bridge is still a quarter mile away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the next moment the car becomes a din of breaking glass, screams, tires screeching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ST. PETERSBURG HIGHWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BLACK MERCEDES roars out on to the road, machine gun fire blazing from its windows, literally shredding the Peugeot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car spins, tires flapping, and hits a highway embankment full speed, launching into the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PEUGEOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A moment of strange silence as the car flips mid-air. The brothers lock eyes for a split second.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FOREST BESIDE ST. PETERSBURG HIGHWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car slams into the steep grassy embankment, manages to flip upright, and rolls into a thick forest, coming to an abrupt stop against a stout tree.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OUT!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
They all four dive out of the car, Bloom shoving Penelope, tumbling into the thick forest an instant before the car becomes a roiling ball of flame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom lies shell-shocked, his vision blurry. He vaguely sees Penelope passed out beside him, Stephen on the other side of the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A DARK FIGURE comes trotting into the woods, shining a flashlight on the charred car. Goes to Stephen. Reaches down to him...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom's mind flutters away into darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FOREST - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom wakes. Rain splattering. Slumped against a tree. Penelope hunches over him.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened?

</BLOOM>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you alright?

<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's Stephen?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We don't know. He was gone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom stands shakily, goes to the charred car. Runs his fingers over the dozens of bullet holes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Goes to where Stephen fell. Lying in the grass, a manila envelope.
</DIRECTION>
<PENELOPE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're going to find him. If he escaped, he'll contact us. If they've got him, it's for ransom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's got him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Russians.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<DIRECTION>
The Chink pulls up in the green bug, headlights catching Bloom's face against the dark forest depths.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A desolate gas station parking lot. Bloom sits in the Bug, loading his revolver with shaky fingers. Penelope stands outside.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stephen, god please what's happening. I don't know what to do. I don't know Stephen please. Please. What's happening. Please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
A long black sedan screeches to a halt in the parking lot outside the window, Bloom bolts out of the car, pistol ready.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But the Chink climbs out of the black sedan.
</DIRECTION>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where does she get all these cars?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom motions for Penelope to stay back, then goes to meet the Chink in the middle of the parking lot.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you know what's happening, now would be a really good time to speak up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
She sets a suitcase down beside her. Bloom takes this in.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, please. Not now. I need your help here now, I don't know what to do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
The slightest smile communicates all the compassion in the world. But she's leaving.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She hands him a small slip of paper, their fingers touching for an instant.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She gives Penelope a quick little "call me" gesture, picks up her case and walks off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A truck blocking our view of her car pulls away, and she gets in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom looks down at the slip of paper. A short phrase, in Chinese.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
The engine turns over, and the Chink's car EXPLODES in a dramatic fireball.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The paper flutters out of Blooms's fingers a moment before he and Penelope are thrown to the pavement by the shock wave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom and Penelope lift their heads, absorbing what just happened.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CHICAGO - DAY
</DIRECTION>

INT. ST. PETERSBURG COPY SHOP - EARLY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom on a pay phone, scribbling on a piece of paper.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh huh. Assholes. Ok. Um, ok. So I've got "We are all assholes in our own theatrical enterprises." You sure?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
This phrase, written on Bloom's paper.
</DIRECTION>
<CHEF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And then it end with "Goodbye shit head."
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHEF>
<DIRECTION>
BLOOM
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit head?
	</DIALOGUE>
<CHEF>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</CHEF>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SIDEWALK - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Bug parked nearby. Penelope sits on the curb, crying. Bloom sits next to her.
</DIRECTION>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did it mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did it say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"We're all of us marks in our own cons." And she said goodbye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I still can't believe it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That the Chink fell for a car bomb? Neither can I.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<PENELOPE>
<DIRECTION>
(hopeful)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? Oh, oh god do you think she faked it? So the Russians would think she was dead?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom stands, paces away. He leafs limply through the manila folder - addresses, pictures, information...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A paper with the Dog's photo clipped to it. An address in St. Petersburg.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The napkin Stephen wrote the con flowchart on. The third box - "The End."

<PENELOPE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do we do now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<DIRECTION>
Scrawled on the inside of the manila envelope - "An unwritten life." Bloom's face clears. He wipes his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ok.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom goes to the Bug.
</DIRECTION>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are you going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This wasn't Russians. This was done by an old mentor of ours who wants us off the map. He has an apartment in St. Petersburg. So this is, yeah. I've gotta go back to that apartment to face the Dog and get my brother back. That's how I'm gonna end this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
Penelope's eyes gleam. She jumps up to the passenger door, and Bloom stops her with a weary look.
</DIRECTION>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can skip the whole you-sending- me-nobly-away-and-me-refusing-to- leave-your-side-thing.

</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
INT. APARTMENT ENTRYWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A badly lit apartment hallway. Bloom approaches a door, Penelope behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His breathing becomes hard. His face contorts. He crumples next to the door.
</DIRECTION>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's in there? Tell me who this guy is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom's breathing steadies.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's just an old man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
He tries the knob. It opens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DIAMOND DOG'S APARTMENT - D
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blood red walls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dark, neglected and to all appearances empty. Bloom creeps down the darkened corridor, gun outstretched. Breathes through his nose, chokes.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dog! I came back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
He kicks open a door, revealing a large living space. Empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He lowers his gun, switches on the light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Penelope enters. Sniffs the air.
</DIRECTION>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Moth balls.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom almost laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that what that smell is?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
BAM! A closet door smacks open, revealing the business end of a double barrel shotgun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom spins, gun drawn. Penelope screams.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then a moment of stillness. The shotgun barrel quivers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's held by the 11 year old boy Bloom saw in the Dog's Mercedes in Prague. Malnourished and scared.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Penelope approaches him slowly.
</DIRECTION>
<PENELOPE>
<DIRECTION>
(in Russian)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay. Honey, it's alright.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<DIRECTION>
The shotgun sinks to the ground. Penelope strokes his hair back from his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom lowers the gun, trembling.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ask him if anyone else is here.
	</DIALOGUE>

She does.

<BOY>
<DIRECTION>
(in English)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Dog of Diamonds is gone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOY>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom does a quick search of the rest of the room. As he does Penelope asks the boy one more question in Russian, and gets a quick answer.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get the car started.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's alright.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
She believes him, and goes. Bloom kneels in front of the boy.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't need to be afraid of him anymore. Or angry at him. Or ever come back here again. He doesn't concern you anymore. Understand? It's gonna be ok.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
The boy nods. Bloom hands him the stack of bills wrapped in the green rubber band. The boy snatches it and runs off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ST. PETERSBURG STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom trots out of the apartment building, and sees two things: Penelope working the VW's starter, and a black Mercedes speeding down the narrow street towards her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sprints towards her, screaming
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get out! Get out of the car!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
She sees the approaching Merc, too late, and ducks down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hand hurls something from the darkened window. It smashes through the Bug's passenger side window, showering Penelope with glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Mercedes roars off down the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom reaches the Bug and throws the door open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Penelope lies covered in safety glass, holding a Russian nesting doll.

	It's a ransom note. It says they have Stephen, it says they want the money wired to a specific account, they give a bank to do it at and a manager to ask for. Then an address to come to, at two p.m. In two hours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll wire the money from my account, and we'll go get Stephen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a lot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How much?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll do it, I want to, I've got plenty-
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How much are they asking for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One point seven five million.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<DIRECTION>
A cold pit opens in Bloom's stomach.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Oh oh. No no NO.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
He punches the dashboard.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No I'll kill him. I'll kill him if that's what this is, if that's all that this is, no NO NO.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you talking about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's another possibility that I should of, I'm a fucking idiot. This might all be a con. By my brother. To get me - oh god - he wanted me to face the Dog, to end it, and he gets your money. Oh god. I'm going to be sick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would he do that? To you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. Yes. Yes of course he would. To tell a story so well it becomes real. The perfect con. That's his whole, goddammit, that's what.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you don't know. Let's transfer the money. You don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Son of a bitch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't know. This is your brother's life. I'm gonna wire the money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ST. PETERSBURG BANK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom sits in the car, alone. He punches the dashboard again, helpless enraged and scared.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Penelope gets in, looks at the address on the note.
</DIRECTION>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ok.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BURNED OUT THEATER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Penelope and Bloom sit in the car, parked in front of the impressive facade of a closed, burned out old theater.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The clock on the dashboard reads 1:50.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm so scared. Anything I can imagine finding in there, I'm scared of.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to be here when you come out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<DIRECTION>
She kisses him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He puts his hand on the door. Hesitates. Then goes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walks up the stairs to the inky maw of the theater door. Goes in alone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THEATER LOBBY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No lights. Moldy dust. A genuinely creepy place. Bloom steps lightly, deeper into the theater.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stephen!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THEATER AUDITORIUM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A few lights flicker on the walls, fitfully illuminating the broken dusty seats and bare ruined stage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom walks down the aisle, trying to keep his voice steady.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stephen!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
A spotlight snaps on from the mezzanine, right in Bloom's face. He spins, trapped in its glare.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A guttural command is shouted in what might be Russian.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When Bloom doesn't respond, the spot silently advances a few feet ahead of him towards the stage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom gingerly follows it, up onto the splintered stage and finally resting on a split in the tarpaulin backdrop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a wary glance back, Bloom steps through it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THEATER BACKSTAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Giant fossils of antique stage scenery. Utility lights high above, cut by scaffolding, patch everything in dim jagged forms of light and black.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
(unsteady)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stephen. Game's up. Come on out. Let's blow this one hat town.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. Then a harsh utility lamp snaps on, cruelly lighting Stephen's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shockingly bruised and battered, old and new blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom cries and rushes towards him...
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! No Bloom, freeze.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
He obeys. Stephen is tied to a chair. A dark figure behind him holds the lamp with a black gloved hand.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stephen, who is it? Is it the Dog?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did Penelope wire the money?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're calling to check right now. Don't move. I'm alright.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
The dark figure's cell phone rings, he holds it to his ear for a moment then flips it closed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Something happens in the blackness, and Stephen shakily stands, cut loose.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay where you are, Bloom. I'm coming to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a couple wobbly steps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind him, Bloom sees the dark figure raising his gun towards Stephen's back, pulling the hammer...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And the utility lamp switches off.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom's revolver pops out of his sleeve and he's firing into the blackness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stephen drops flat to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fiery rapport of a big pistol flashes from the blackness, strobing the scene like stage lightning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom reloads behind the cover of a heavy flat, but Stephen lies on his stomach out in the open.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stephen!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay back!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
But Bloom makes a dash for his brother, out into the open, unloading three more rounds into the dark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dark figure returns fire on Bloom, who is sprinting full on his feet in a large pool of light. A sitting duck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stephen launches himself up, tackling Bloom backwards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just before they fall behind the safety of the flat, a red burst of blood flowers from Stephen's left lower back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom sets him down gently, and hears heavy footsteps behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns, firing, but only sees a blur of dark coat go by, through the torn backdrop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom runs out on stage, tearing the tarpaulin, and fires after the dark figure limping up the aisle and away into the lobby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom walks back to Stephen, who lies behind the flat, breathing heavy. Blood soaking through his shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please tell me this is all gonna be ok. Tell me that's a squib, and that's makeup, and that you just gave me what I always wanted and pulled off the perfect con.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
A long, long moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stephen coughs, spits. Then a wry grin spreads across his face.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You said it, not me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
He stands, the shakiness gone.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I get a `wow' for this one?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You son of a bitch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom looks like he might hit him, but his face breaks and he embraces him, crying. The Brothers Bloom stay like that for a long while, holding each other in the spotlight's glow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally Stephen pulls away, tears in his eyes. He wipes them, wipes blood from his lip.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tastes like tin foil. Alright here's what I want you to do. The Chink split?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Clean exit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Car bomb.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
A hint of relief in Stephen's face.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. Here's what. Take Penelope back to Helsinki, take that flight to Rio. Lay low like we said. Play out the on-the-run-from- vengeful-Russians thing, that'll be fun for her. Play it like I'm dead, actually - that'll add some gravity to everything, that'll be nice. And I'll see you when I see you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Soon?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope not. Last thing you need is me hanging around. Anyway, how could I top this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom hugs him again.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you. Bye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
He turns to go.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. Think of any card.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
Stephen pulls out a pack of cards.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
Stephen cuts, to the Queen of hearts.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stephen. That's it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(grins)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the best card trick I've ever seen. I just wish you had a bigger audience.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're the only audience I've ever needed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
Wink. Bloom leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stephen watches him go.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RUSSIA HIGHWAY - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rumbling towards Finland.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the Bug, Bloom sleeps in Penelope's arm while she drives.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at his hand on hers, his shirt cuff bright red with Stephen's "blood." She strokes his shoulder sadly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Off Bloom's sleeping face...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THEATER STAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stephen pulls a chair out onto the stage, sets it right in the spotlight's glare.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trembling as if it takes all his last strength in the world.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sits. Looks at the Queen of Hearts, moves his fingers over it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then slides is up his sleeve.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blood trickles down his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUG - SUNSET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom wakes with a start.
</DIRECTION>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. Hey, it's ok. The bridge is coming up, we're almost at the border. Were you dreaming about Stephen?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<DIRECTION>
She strokes his hair back from his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He nods, and looks down at his sleeve.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stephen's "blood" on his white cuff.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now a dark shade of brown.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom looks at this shirt. All the blood, it's all brown.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up at the road, nearly panicked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maybe a quarter mile ahead is the bridge.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pull over. Pull over!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROADSIDE - SUNSET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She does.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He bursts out of the car, and run/tumbles down the grassy hillside till he finds the car tracks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He follows them to the charred remains of the Peugeot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Penelope stumbles down after him.
</DIRECTION>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it? You're scaring me-
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did you ask the Russian kid, in the Dog's apartment? He said the Dog isn't here, then what did you ask?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom kicks open the trunk. Pries open the blistered attache case.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sifts through the charred pile of cinders that was the money from the "Russians" till he finds what he was looking for and brings it out into the dying light.
</DIRECTION>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How long had he been alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what did he say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
A scrap of unburned money. A fragment of Ben Franklin's face.
</DIRECTION>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Since yesterday morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<DIRECTION>
A single eye gazing up at him, the green grass behind it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The eye is perfect. No cross hatching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom sinks to his knees.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is real. They hassled you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bloom-
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Dog was gone before we got there. They hadn't cleared out of their apartment, they had been cleared out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DIAMOND DOG'S APARTMENT - DAY FLASHBACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RUSSIANS in black overcoats burst in, shooting the Dog's men with silenced pistols.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The BOY shuts himself in the closet, terrified.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROADSIDE - SUNSET
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Real Russians. Took his store. They didn't know about his deal with us, but you haggled with them. You really sold the book to real Russians. The Diamond Dog was gone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RUSSIA HIGHWAY - FLASHBACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The scene beside the lake, our four heroes checking the money in the attache case.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's get the hell out of Russia.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom tosses the gold lighter, it splashes into the lake. We follow it, plunging beneath the surface.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Deep deep down, among weak tendrils of light, the Diamond Dog sinks into watery blackness, a long blade in his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROADSIDE - SUNSET
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And they came after us. And Stephen...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
Penelope holds him tight.
</DIRECTION>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stephen saved my life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's gone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom folds into Penelope's arms, but she doesn't let him. She holds his crying face up.
</DIRECTION>
<PENELOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And he did it so you could live. Your brother loved you. He loved you so much. Look at me. Stephen said something once, I got the feeling he'd rather be telling it to you. He said there's no such thing as an unwritten life. Just badly written ones. I love you. We're gonna outrun these bastard Russian mafia, and we're gonna hide out in Rio, then we're gonna live like we're telling the best fucking story in the world. Are you ready?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENELOPE>
<DIRECTION>
She holds his face close to hers for a long beat. Then smiles and pushes away, launching up the grassy hill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloom watches her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Time slows as she turns back towards him, still running, and holds out her hand for him to follow.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was thinking of something Stephen said too. "The perfect con is one where everyone involved gets just the thing they wanted." Well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
He takes the girl's hand, and runs with her towards the point of light breaking over the hill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HIGHWAY - SUNSET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sunset with her wine-red fingers falls over the road ahead. The rumbly old VW chugs away from us, towards the horizon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
