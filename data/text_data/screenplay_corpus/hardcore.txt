CREDITS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Credits are played over Currier and Ives-like winter scenes from life in Grand Rapids. It's Christmas morning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Two well-bundled youths shovel out a suburban driveway while their father scrapes ice off the family car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Youths pelter a passing car with snowballs. Others, more daring companions, grab onto the car's rear bumper and hitch a free ride across the icy roads and past a sign which reads "Grand Rapids City Limits."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Christmas decorations hang from the lamp posts on Monroe Avenue.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Children, dressed in bright parkas, and breathing steam, compare their Christmas presents: sleds, skis and a toboggan. In the b.g., other children speed down Richmond Park Hill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- A woman's distant voice sings an old hymn:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"Precious memories, unseen angels, Sent from somewhere to my soul, How they linger ever near me, And the sacred past unfolds. Precious memories, how they linger, How they ever flood my soul, In the stillness of the midnight, Precious sacred scenes unfold. Precious father, loving mother, Fly across the lonely years, And old home scenes of my childhood In fond memories appear."

INT. VAN DORN HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Four generations of the Van Dorn family have gathered at the family home.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A long kitchen leads to the dining area, then to the spacious living room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The house is perhaps one hundred years old; deeply varnished woodwork and patterned yellow wallpaper section off the walls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Apart from several recent tasteless acquisitions (an E-Z Boy lounge chair to replace the old Queen Anne which broke two Easters ago), the house remains furnished in the style of the previous century. The old dining room table, which Grandfather Van Dorn built because he was too cheap to buy one, has now become a priceless antique.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rooms are littered with religious calendars, Bibles and plaster-of-Paris plaques bearing such sentiments as "As For Me and My House, We Will Serve the Lord." The oak buffet is laden with similar religious knickknacks and chintz. Framed, tinted photographs of the family patriarchs are indiscriminately mixed with newer snapshots of proud fathers and high school graduates.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The house radiates a sense of continuity. Generations come and go; the family remains. All of life's "old home scenes" have been played out here: births, deaths, romances, blasphemies, betrayals. And now the air is again alive with the sounds of playing children, busy housewives and bickering uncles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The kitchen is crowded with mothers, daughters and aunts. Each has brought a special dish. ANNE DE JONG (nee Van Dorn), thirty-five, supervises the final preparations. One aunt shows another snapshots of her new grandchild.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAKE VAN DORN, forty, and his brother JOE, fifty, sit at the table watching the kitchen activity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The house echoes with small talk:
</DIRECTION>
<AUNT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...He got accepted at Grand Valley, but he'd rather go to Michigan...
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUNT>
<NEPHEW_1>

	...Get that pink rot...
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEPHEW_1>
<NEPHEW_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...No way Uncle Joe talk me into cutting celery again this summer. Rather work in the car wash.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEPHEW_2>
<DIRECTION>
As the CAMERA TRACKS THROUGH the dining room, it passes a cluster of men standing near the buffet. WES DE JONG and JOHN VAN DORN, both about forty, casually discuss a theological point with GRANDFATHER VAN DORN. Across the table, a young boy, about eleven, listens with rapt awe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
These are men of the soil. Their faces are sun-blotched and weather-beaten. Wes has rolled up the sleeves of his white shirt; John has switched to a more comfortable plaid.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I still say that if a man has committed the unpardonable sin, he knows he has.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
Grandfather nods head approvingly.
</DIRECTION>
<WES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know about that, John. It don't seem to account much for God's grace.

INT. DEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Most of the teenagers have crowded into what was once called the study, but is now the "television room." KRISTEN VAN DORN, fourteen, and MARSHA DE JONG, fifteen, are scrunched onto the sofa. Kristen has long blonde hair, a clean Dutch complexion and an unaffected beauty. The girls' legs are innocently wrapped around each other's.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOE, forty-five, another of the Van Dorn brothers, and a male cousin about nineteen, are also squeezed on the sofa. Young children squat on the floor in front of them. All are watching some inane Christmas variety show.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe, bored of this tripe, gets up and turns off the set. The children wail in unison. "Aw, c'mon, Uncle Joe."
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sick of watching this television stuff. You know who makes it? All the kids who couldn't get along here. They go out to California and make television. I didn't like 'em when they were here, and I don't like 'em out there.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

As Joe leaves the den, he passes Jake Van Dorn and Wes De Jong. Unlike his older brother, Jake is not a man of the soil. He has been to college and runs his own business. He looks well-groomed and comfortable in his navy suit, white shirt and striped tie. Wes is Jake's brother-in-law and friend. They get along well enough.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Jake and Wes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Television. If you don't buy one yourself, the kids go someplace else and watch. And what do they sell on television? More televisions.

Bill looks at blanket-headed Lenard, who has no idea of what's going on.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think so...

The diners turn their heads toward Jake who stands at the far end of the table, his closed fists pressed against the tabletop. He lowers his head in prayer.

One of the mothers, looking at her son, Lenard, quickly pulls the blanket off his head.

Jake nods.

Kristen, wearing a light blue sweater and skirt, emerges from the bedroom. She smiles demurely.

Her suitcase is in her hand. Jake, for a moment, feels a sharp twinge of loss. A foreboding of the day when Kristen, fully grown, will leave his house for good.

Parents watch their children board a snow-covered bus outside Twelfth St. Church. A banner across the side of the bus reads:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
YOUNG CALVINIST CONVENTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRAND RAPIDS, MICH. -- BELLFLOWER, CALIF.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Most of the parents, working folk long accustomed to the brutal Michigan winters, wear heavy overcoats, bearskin caps, fur-lined gloves and galoshes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jake, bare-headed and wearing a thin topcoat over his suit, waits with Kristen, Marsha, Wes and Anne. Harold Jay pelts the side of the bus with a snowball.

MRS. STEENSMA, one of the trip counselors, reads off the youngsters' names as they board the bus:

A sigh of relief goes up from the adolescent conventioneers: wheew! There are a few isolated cries of "We're on our way!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A teenager instantly flips on his transistor RADIO to metal ROCK. Once away from home, these kids, like all kids, are the children of 1976. The old family glue doesn't hold. They live in the world of rock and television.

<DIRECTION>
Workmen fashion table legs on a wood lathe. In another part of the factory, laborers assemble chair frames.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jake walks along the assembly line with MARY, a well-dressed, attractive employee about twenty-five. They turn a corner and step into a display area where a set features the Van Dorn Co.'s new modular office designs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mary shows Jake the set for his approval.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this all the display space we can get?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I tried to get more, but this is the limit. The De Vries line has the same area.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>

Mary is a cool, efficient display designer. Jake studies a patch of bright blue on the right wall.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you think of this... ah, shade of blue, Mary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like it, Mr. Van Dorn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you think it's a little too... bright?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not really. But if you want me to tone it down...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no. I wouldn't hire a display designer if I didn't trust her taste. Maybe we should bring in more of that shade. Perhaps a stripe across the back wall.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
He gestures.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gently, relentlessly, Jake manipulates Mary. He does not wish to impose his taste on her but, through calculated argument, will get her to accept his views. It's only a matter of time before he wears her down.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, that would be much too overpowering.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, overpowering. That was the word I was looking for.

<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that shade of blue called?

INT. THEATRE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jake is uncomfortably seated in the dingy thirty-seat theatre. Mast walks back from the projection booth as the film starts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sits next to Van Dorn. We slowly TRACK INTO Jake's face as the color drains from it. O.S. We HEAR groans and the sounds of flesh on flesh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We TRACK SLOWLY INTO the film itself:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A 16mm hardcore short on a simple, but classic theme -- rape. Two young men force a young, unwilling girl to submit to their desires. The girl -- Kristen -- nude, tries to get out of a wrinkled bed but is restrained by the long arm of a languid, long-haired nude youth. Another young man, wearing only pink elastic shorts, steps into the frame and takes Kristen into his arms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The quality of the action is quite low; the young men posture and overact in the manner of high school dramatics. Occasionally, the action stops while the actors receive cues from an off-screen director. Grunts and groans are dubbed into the screen action.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Only Kristen's performance lends a note of credibility to the proceedings. She is genuinely disoriented or frightened -- or both. She's not play acting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For one frightening moment, Kristen, regaining full consciousness, fights back, but the youth in pink shorts slaps her into submission. Her eyes turn pleadingly toward the camera.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The first youth laughs and takes Kristen into his arms. The youth in the pink shorts kneels on the edge of the bed and instructs Kristen to remove his shorts. As she begins to do this, the first youth fucks her from the rear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the film ends, Jake sinks his head into his hands, speaking to himself. It's almost as if we're hearing his thoughts:
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It can't be. Why me? What have I done?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
Looking up, he says softly, then louder:

INT. HOLLYWOOD MOTEL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A porn film is being shot in a tacky motel room furnished with a pink circular water bed, a lime-brown shag rug, and peeling red felt wallpaper. An oil painting of a seagull in flight adds a touch of class.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The small set is crowded with technicians and onlookers. The harried collegiate filmmakers wear scruffy jeans and T-shirts. The onlookers, more refined, sport double knit suits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two girls and a middle-aged man lie on the pink satin sheets. Beach towels protect them from the unheated water bed. One of the girls, NIKI, has a long blonde wig and looks about nineteen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The makeup girl hurriedly dabs some last minute cosmetic on the second girl's breast. A young man in a UCLA T-shirt pastes up the peeling wallpaper above the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Random VOICES ECHO around the set. The DIRECTOR, a student filmmaker, tries to bring the set to order.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILL RAMADA, 40, the Producer, watches silently from the b.g. He's in charge here. He wears gabardine slacks and a Gucci shirt.

All one needs is the will and the intellect to pursue those solutions.

There's no immediate answer. Hearing some commotion in the room, Jake stops, listens. He peeks through the partially- curtained window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside, he sees Mast banging away with a TEENAGE GIRL on the sofa.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jake is curious, then outraged. He tries the door. It opens.

Inside, Mast and his teenage companion scramble for their clothes. The girl calls out.

Jake strides into Mast's apartment.

Mast, his belt unbuckled, puts on his shirt. The Teenage Girl, pulling a Grateful Dead T-shirt over her head, looks at Jake and says:
</DIRECTION>
<TEENAGE_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who the fuck is this?

Not pausing to speak, Jake pushes Mast against the sofa. Reaching down, he pulls the detective up by the collar.

	What are you doing? You son-of-a- bitch! I've been paying you every week for three months and you've been out here...

Mast closes the door behind him. Van Dorn looks around the apartment. It's calm now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the desk are Mast's briefcase and papers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looking through Mast's files, Jake finds pages and pages of notes and information about his daughter's disappearance. Names, places, dates. Lists of massage parlors, sex shops, porn bookshops. The names of owners, managers, filmmakers, Interviews with street girls, cops, landlords.

His collar open, his tie loosened, Van Dorn squats over the notes and interviews. He studies his find. It includes:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- sex ads from various local papers. Some are crossed out, others circled, others checked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- a list of massage parlors and sex shops under the heading "possible K was here."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- An L.A. Times newspaper clipping about "Bill Ramada, L.A. Porn Movie Mogul." It features a photo of Ramada on his way out of court.

EXT. LOS ANGELES - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Van Dorn drives through the crowded streets of Los Angeles' tenderloin. He cruises down Santa Monica, up Western, along Hollywood and back down to Santa Monica.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He passes row upon row of garish adult bookstores, massage parlors and porn theatres. He passes model shops, topless bars, "erotic motels," and peep shows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Teenage girls stand in the red neon shadows, calling out to passing strangers. Drag queens and leather boys cruise the sidewalks. Jet black pimps, sporting high heels and make coats, stroll from one massage parlor to another. The sound of Latin jazz comes from one doorway; soul disco from another. L.A.P.D. black and whites patrol the streets. Occasionally, a uniformed officer leans out to hassle a passing pimp or hooker.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He drives on. The sex shops have names like "The Sexual Catharthis Center," "Pandora's Box," "The Institute of Oral Love," "69 Club," "The Church of Spiritual Sexuality," "The Participating Center of Sexual Experience," "Mother's Fun Palace," "The Hot Box."
</DIRECTION>

INT. ADONIS BOOKSHOP - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jake steps into the bookstore and looks cautiously from side to side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His expression is stern, withdrawn, as if suppressing some physical pain. He finds nothing titillating about this world; for him it is simply evil. Neither is he shocked. Has he not been taught: "For every imagination of man's heart is only evil continually"?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An improbable assortment of men peruse the long racks of pornographic books and magazines. A young MALE TELLER sits next to a cash register atop a high counter. Below him, a display case features sexual paraphernalia and films. A small radio softly plays Muzak.
</DIRECTION>
<TELLER>

<DIRECTION>
Jake fishes in his pocket, comes up with a couple quarters and places them on the counter. The Teller gives him a token in return.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Van Dorn walks down one row and up another. The explicit titles and magazine covers leap out at him: "Cropped Crotches," "Teenage Obedience Lesson," "Mouthful of Cock," "Hogtie." Many of the magazine covers feature obviously underage girls. He eases his way past a butch young man looking at magazines in the gay section.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Screwing up his courage, Jake steps back to the counter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He tries but cannot avert his eyes from the grotesque sexual novelties in the case. Dildos, some small, some huge and gross, looking more like instruments of torture than pleasure. Stimulators, vibrators, spiked ticklers. Penis enlargers. Leather paddles, whips, masks, rubber vaginas, fuck faces, masturbators.

Beatrice and the Thin Man step into the Domination Room: a simulation of a Medieval dungeon. A large wood X-shaped cross is bolted to one wall. There are straps for the client's hands and feet. Instruments of torture hang from another wall. A bare-breasted girl, wearing bikini pants and leather chaps, sits lethargically on a folding chair. A mask of black leather and buckles completely cover her face.

Later that night. Jake locks his car and walks south on Western toward Santa Monica Boulevard. Ahead, a continuous row of massage parlors blend into neon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Girls call out as he walks: "Come on in and get free information," and "Want to have a good time?" and "Lonely?"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stops by the Stairway to Love. Three girls stand just inside the door. A sign in the window reads: "Come in -- Satisfaction Here." He enters.

Jake gives Felice a couple tens. She in turn passes them to the MANAGER, a 225 pound, blond-haired Malibu surfer. He puts the money in a cash box and fills out a time sheet.

Felice shows Jake into a ten-by-ten cubicle. The walls are barren; a bed-sized slab of foam rubber lies on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<FELICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a second. I've got to get a sheet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELICE>
<DIRECTION>
He looks around the small room. Through the makeshift pasteboard walls he can hear the SOUNDS OF OTHER COUPLES "making love."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Felice quickly returns with a sheet and spreads it across the foam. She slides the door shut behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<FELICE>

<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I don't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<FELICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to ask you that. If you were Vice you couldn't deny it. You ought to dress less square. You wouldn't get hassled so much. Here, let me help you get that tie off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELICE>
<DIRECTION>
Felice reaches over to loosen his tie. Jake, self-conscious, removes his tie.

<JAKE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<FELICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cops aren't allowed to do that either. A judge ruled that that was entrapment. Don't ask me why. I guess he figured the sight of a Vice Officer's dong would make a girl unable to stop herself.

</FELICE>

She laughs.

Jake digs out a couple twenties and gives them to her. Felice tucks the bills into her bikini crotch and pulls off her shirt top. Her breasts seem surprisingly pale and small.

Jake knocks over a small table. The Manager has had enough. He grabs Jake's arm, wrenches it tight behind his back and rams Jake's face into the wall. He forces Jake down the stairway of love.

Jake struggles and kicks, but is no match for the larger man. At the foot of the stairs, the Manager ejects Jake, thrusting him across the sidewalk.

Jake rams face-first into a parked car. He staggers on the sidewalk. His mouth and nose bloody.

His face is bruised, his lip is swollen. An open First Aid Kit sits on the lamp stand.

LATER. Jake slouches in a chair watching "Day of Discovery," a Sunday evening religious program. The chorus of wholesome young people look like they've come from another planet.

	Don't get me wrong. A couple years ago, I woulda jumped at fifty thousand dollars possible financing. But the Lord's been good to me. I can now finance any films I choose. Big ones, small ones. Right now we're setting up a two hundred thousand dollar feature film. Live sound. I like to keep my own money in my films. That way you don't have to share the profits. There's plenty of guys in town that'll take it, though. But if I was you, Mr... what was your name again?

<DIRECTION>
The next day, Van Dorn waits in line to place a "Personals" ad in the Los Angeles Free Press.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He wears an open sport shirt, slacks and loafers. Bit by bit he's been going native. He realizes he isn't going to infiltrate the pornography underworld looking like a furniture dealer from Grand Rapids.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Even so, Jake's conventional dress sets him apart from his fellow advertisers. The long line winds back and forth and represents just about every possible deviation from the American heterosexual norm: studs, butches, hookers, freaks, cultists: misfits all.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA studies the line: an attractive boy wears a studded collar, a low-rider sports his colors, a diminutive girl waits silently in her hari-krishna robe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The line inches forward. Behind Jake, one woman tells another about this great swinging party. Van Dorn takes some comfort in the fact that the MAN in front of him, dressed in a seersucker suit, looks pretty straight.

The script evidently calls for "Dark Road -- Night" because that's where the gaffer is arranging lights around a parked red Mustang. A YOUNG ACTOR in a soldier's uniform waits in the car. Niki and another actress, dressed as a stewardess, stand on their marks near the front of the car.

Ramada and Kurt walk over to talk to the YOUNG DIRECTOR. Niki, finished for the moment, walks back toward the trailer.

There is a pause, the Director calls: "ACTION!" and the Mustang drives to where the two stewardesses, stranded, are waving for help. The cameraman pans with the Mustang. The Soldier opens his door, looks at the girls' car and offers to help.

Van Dorn pulls his rented Pontiac into the lot and parks in the first available space.

Weary, he gets out of the car and heads for his room. He passes a colored whore with a towering synthetic wig.

Further down the line of rooms, Wes De Jong sits slouched in the front seat of his rental car, watching, waiting.

A prostitute wearing jeans and a shoulder bag, enters a lighted room with her trick, a construction worker. He unbuttons his shirt as she closes the curtains.

The decor is Vegas sleaze: tinted mirrors, red shag carpets, felt wallpaper, pseudo-Louis Seize chairs and a plexiglass chandelier.

</JAKE>
<WES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I called every L.A. hotel. The Holiday Inn gave this as a referral number. Your office said you had no business in New York, so I figured you had come out here.

Jake stands and steps over to Wes:

	What will I tell the others? They care about you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WES>
<JAKE>

	Tell them anything you want. Tell them I'm on a vacation, a business trip. Tell them I needed a rest. Tell them anything, just don't tell them...

Jake looks about the whorey room. His voice cracks a little.

<JAKE>

Jake escorts his brother-in-law to the door. Wes turns and embraces him. Jake breaks the embrace and firmly pushes Wes out of the room.

INT. PLAYERS MOTEL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The next morning. Jake has rearranged the furniture so that the sofa directly faces the door. Van Dorn, wearing a blue tie-dyed shirt with a sunburst on the front, sits in the middle of the sofa. On either side of the sofa tall thin lamps stand on end tables. A telephone, legal pad and travel clock have been placed on the coffee table. Beside Jake rests Mast's sheaf of notes and pictures. Behind him hangs an iridescent poster featuring the sex signs of the zodiac.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He waits. There is a knock at the door.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
A handsome STUD, about 22, wearing tight jeans, steps cautiously into the room.
</DIRECTION>
<STUD_1>

</STUD_1>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're casting male roles in an explicit sex action feature. The pay is $100 a day. There'll be up to two weeks work. You say you've had experience?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<STUD_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was in the Mitchell Brothers' film, 'Sodom and Gomorrah.' I don't know if you saw that. I played Damon, the slave of the Queen of Gomorrah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STUD_1>
<DIRECTION>
Van Dorn's pretty good at this. He's given many job interviews before. The phone rings and he answers.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, this is Jake.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll see you then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
Van Dorn hangs up and looks through his sheaf of papers. Pulling back a page of notes, he reveals the unfolded 8x10 glossy from "Slave of Love." He looks at the two young men violating his daughter, then back up at Peter Long. Long is neither of the men.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, Pete. I have your exchange here. If we decide to use you, we'll give you a call.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
Long turns and exits. Jake checks his appointment schedule then puts his hand to his temples. He has become the thing he hates most: the procurer. Self-contempt fills his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIMECUT: The next interviewee stands in front of Van Dorn. He's a tall black man about 25. An ex-athlete.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not exactly the type we're looking for.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	No, just not the type.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<BLACK_STUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean, not the type? Don't you know who I am? I'm Big Dick Brown! I've been in more porno movies than you ever saw. I've worked with Harry Reems. I've worked with Johnny Wad. Not the type! I can come ten times a day. I can keep it hard two hours at a time. My cock is nine inches long.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACK_STUD>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, Mr. Brown. I'm sure you're very good, but at the moment, I've got nothing for you. If something comes up, we'll give you a call.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<BLACK_STUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit! You just don't want to hire a nigger, that's all. I knew this was a scam. I shouldn'ta come.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACK_STUD>
<DIRECTION>
The Black Stud turns and storms out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIMECUT: An angelic, muscular boy about 19 stands in front of Van Dorn. Jake looks weary.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
(tired)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, but you're just not the type we are looking for. We had something else in mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<STUD_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you want to see my stuff, man?
	</DIALOGUE>

</JAKE>
<STUD_2>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing to crotch)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, my stuff!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STUD_2>
<DIRECTION>
Jake nods with resignation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boy drops his jeans. Framed by firm, smooth, naked thighs, Van Dorn looks at the angelic boy's "stuff." He nods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIMECUT: It's the end of the day. The last orange rays of sun come through the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jake, weary, looks up. A young man steps in from the fading sunlight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The young man looks about 21. His sun-bleached hair falls just to his shoulders. A hippie who's hit the streets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jake looks at his 8x10 glossy, then back at the young man. This is him. This is the young man in the pink bikini shorts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is the YOUTH from Kristen's hardcore movie, the one who slapped her, the one who forced her face into his crotch.
</DIRECTION>
<JISM_JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey man.

</JISM_JIM>
<JAKE>

</JAKE>
<JISM_JIM>
<DIRECTION>
(initially hostile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. Word's out on the street -- word's also out you ain't really hiring anyone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JISM_JIM>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not true, Mr...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<JISM_JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jim Sullivan. Sometimes they call me Jism Jim.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JISM_JIM>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not true, Jim. In fact, I think you're very close to the type we're looking for.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
Jim immediately becomes more compliant.
</DIRECTION>
<JISM_JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yeah? I've done a lot of good stuff. Shorts, features. No major roles it's true. But good stuff.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JISM_JIM>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
Jake reaches over and picks up the glossy.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've seen you in some stuff. I like your looks. I particularly liked you in this film.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
Jake shows him the glossy.
</DIRECTION>
<JISM_JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yeah? I remember that. It was made by some college kids.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JISM_JIM>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was called 'Slave of Love.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<JISM_JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God, I don't know what it was called. I never saw it. I only got twenty- five bucks for the whole Goddamned thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JISM_JIM>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you were quite good in it. I also like the girl in it. Really thought she was good.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(points out Kristen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wondered if she was still around. If she was still working.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
Jim examines Kristen's picture. His expression sours.
</DIRECTION>
<JISM_JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a minute. Look, I need the work and I want to be in your picture, but that is one bitch I will never work with again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JISM_JIM>
<DIRECTION>
Jim, nervous, paces around. He tries to explain.
</DIRECTION>
<JISM_JIM>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, that was one freaky bitch, one very, very freaky bitch. I don't know what she was into, I don't know what she was on, but I don't want to have anything to do with her again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JISM_JIM>
<DIRECTION>
Jake's face grows cold and mean as he listens to Jim's description of his daughter's defilement.
</DIRECTION>
<JISM_JIM>
<DIRECTION>
(cups genitals with right hand)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know what she did to me? Do you know what she did to me, man? That fucking cunt! I couldn't walk for a week. My prick was sore and red and chewed out. She was cra-zy. I don't want to work with her again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JISM_JIM>
<DIRECTION>
All the while Jim speaks, Van Dorn's long arm reaches slowly for the lamp on his right.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His right hand locks around the base of the lamp. Still listening, watching Jim intensely, Jake grips the balls of his feet into the carpet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jake is beyond logic, beyond restraint.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He rises, lamp in hand. The cord pops out of the wall; the bulb flashes out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reaching across the table, Van Dorn smashes the youth across the face. The plaster lamp shatters; the shade flies off. Jim reels backward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Knocking over the coffee table, Van Dorn advances on the dazed, bleeding youth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Van Dorn pounds him again with the plaster stump of the lamp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Van Dorn stops. He looks down at Jism Jim. The youth is barely conscious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Realizing what he's done, Jake pulls Jim up by his collar and drags him into the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He hauls the youth into the large "erotic" shower. He pulls the shower douche off the wall, and sprays Jim's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The battered youth opens his eyes. He's terrified. He's been in kinky scenes before. He pleads:
</DIRECTION>
<JISM_JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, stop, stop. I'll do anything you want. It's okay. I can dig it. You can do anything you want to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JISM_JIM>
<JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
(full of rage)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is she? Where is the girl?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<JISM_JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's got a man. A white guy. Tod something or other.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JISM_JIM>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where does he hang out?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<JISM_JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JISM_JIM>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<JISM_JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I know this chick Niki. She works at Les Girls. She would know. Honest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JISM_JIM>
<DIRECTION>
Van Dorn lets him go and starts to walk away. Looking back, he sees Jism Jim struggling to his feet. Jake spins around and punches him once more. Jism Jim tumbles back into his shower. Jake walks off rubbing his red knuckles.

EXT. LES GIRLS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Les Girls, a garish sexual supermarket, covers several storefronts. Its fluorescent exterior stands open to drifters and browsers alike.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jake straightens his tie-dye shirt, and enters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LES GIRLS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside Les Girls is a glow of yellow and orange plexiglass. The bright fluorescents bounce off the white linoleum.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jake passes an arcade of peep shows and turns the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On one side is a rotunda around which men stand in pay stalls watching a pair of naked female dancers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the other side is a row of curtained "phone booths."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jake walks up to a WOMAN with a coin changer around her waist. A lifer.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was told to meet a girl named Niki here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<LES_GIRLS_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>

Jake starts over.

	It's five dollars for two minutes.

</LES_GIRLS_WOMAN>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<LES_GIRLS_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Five dollars a token.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LES_GIRLS_WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Jake fishes in his pocket and pulls out a ten-dollar bill. He hands it to the woman.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here. I'll take two.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
The Les Girls Woman punches out two tokens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jake cautiously pulls the curtain aside and steps into the first booth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The booth is divided by a floor-to-top glass partition. On Jake's side of the partition is a pay wall phone. On the other is an orange folding chair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sign on the phone reads "One token -- two minutes." Jake puts a token in the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Niki, the girl from Ramada's set, naked, steps into the other half of the booth and plops down on the chair.
</DIRECTION>
<NIKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKI>

Jake picks up the receiver in his half.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you Niki?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<NIKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. Like in Mikey and Niki. Did you see that picture?

</NIKI>
<JAKE>

</JAKE>
<NIKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too bad. I wasn't in it.

Jake's eyes flash downward for a moment. No longer shocked, he is saddened by the demeaning vulgarity of it all.
</DIRECTION>

	It's your money. You talk.

There is a CLICK and the phone goes dead. Niki says something but Jake cannot hear her. She motions to the phone as she gets up to leave.

Jake puts his second token in the phone and Niki sits back down.

Usually when you put the pressure on the porn underworld for an underage kid, she pops up in about a week.

In fact, certain people for this girl and -- nothing.

Seeing no one he recognizes, he pays his admission fee walks down a rack, picks up a copy of "Hot Twat," pages through it.

It's been over a week since Jake first stepped into a porno bookstore. The change in his manner is striking. He now seems at ease in the endless night-world of pandering and pornography.

A few moments later, a long-haired man steps up behind him. The young man is wearing red alligator boots and a silver and turquoise belt -- like the man in "Slave of Love." Tod scrutinizes Jake a moment before speaking.

Tod ushers Jake into a barren "office" in the rear of the parlor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sheet has been tacked up at one end of the office. Across the room, the projectionist, a boy about 15, stands next to a battered old 16mm silent projector.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two other men sit in the darkened room. One looks middle- aged and decadent; the other, about 26, wears jeans, a western shirt, and a beat up flight jacket. He's saved up several years for this.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jake sits in an empty office chair next to the other men.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tod nods to the boy and he starts up the projector. A grainy black and white image appears on the screen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The projectionist punches a cheap cassette player which echoes scratchy Mexican fiesta music through the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's clear why the projectionist has chosen a Latin sound track: the film is set up in a Tijuana flophouse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On screen, a girl with long blonde hair and Kristen's build sits on the edge of a barren double bed. She wears jeans and a shirt. Her face is covered by a black leather mask. The eye slits are taped shut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Cerveza poster of a half-naked Mexican girl hangs on the wall behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A young Mexican, stripped to the waist, walks over to the girl. Taking instructions from someone off camera, he starts to undress her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The girl, unable to see her seducer, nevertheless submits to his desires.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jake watches the screen from the shadows. The pale images flicker across a metal filing cabinet behind him. Tod slips out of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On screen, the young Mexican has finished the girl. He turns to the director for further instructions.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A man wearing a white suit walks into the frame. He flashes a stiletto from his sleeve and stabs the young Mexican. The girl, not able to see what is happening, turns her head quizzically.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jake watches in unbelieving horror. The young man in the flight jacket is calm and dispassionate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The young Mexican falls to the floor bleeding. The man in the white suit bends down and wipes the stiletto on the Mexican's pant leg.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man in the white suit steps over to the girl and puts one hand under her mask. He lifts his stiletto again. He rips off the mask from the girl's face; it is not Kristen.
</DIRECTION>

Jake is relieved. The faces of the others are full of anticipation.

As Jake steps through the barred black door, he is hit with a wave of familiar smells: Human sweat, blood and sexual fluids.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The House of Bondage specializes in the three "disciplines:" bondage, dominance and humiliation. It has four domination rooms, each decorated in a different decor -- Babylonian, Medieval, Louis Quatorze, prison motifs -- to satisfy a variety of tastes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two dominants, dressed in black satin pants and shirts, sit on the sofa. HOPE, wearing a black silver-studded collar, walks over to Jake. Her voice is hard:

He passes the Louis Quatorze Room. It, too, is empty.

Jake is beyond reasoning. Tod looks around for an alternate route of escape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tod ducks into the Prison Room. Jake follows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vertical bars cover the grey walls. Handcuffs and chains hang from the bars. In the center of the room, a Harley Davidson "Hog" is incongruously mounted, its front wheel pointed skyward. Leather straps are attached to the handlebars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tod skirts the Harley and pushes it toward Jake as he enters. The huge 1200-pound machine crashes toward Van Dorn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jake jumps back as the bike bounces in front of him, then starts for Tod.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lowering his shoulder, Tod smashes through the thin pasteboard wall. Jake, steeping over the motorcycle, pursues.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the Louis Quatorze Room, Jake grabs Tod by the shoulders and spins him around. Tod swings as he turns, hitting Jake. Jake grabs Tod's legs as he falls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They both crash through the next pasteboard wall into the Medieval Dungeon.

Tod breaks free, runs through the dungeon and bursts through the last pasteboard wall. Jake pulls himself to his feet and follows.

Passing a parking meter, Jake smashes Tod's head into it. Tod's forehead cracks into the glass.

A man wearing a white suit sits at a table with several girls. He immediately recognizes Tod. This is RATAN. The man who killed the young Mexican and girl in the film.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ratan starts to rise. Jake drops Tod and heads toward Ratan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A girl wearing a skimpy halter stands up between Ratan and Jake. She turns and looks back at Jake: it is Kristen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is terrified. Kristen turns and runs away, stumbling over a chair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ratan rushes toward the front door.

In the same instant Jake sees Kristen falling, Ratan fleeing.

Trying to get around Jake, Ratan flashes his stiletto forward.

A gash razors across Jake's upper chest.

Sinking backward against the broken glass, Ratan swings his stiletto at Jake.

Jake, protecting himself from the knife, flips Ratan over.

Ratan's chest and stomach rasp across the jagged glass.

Jake grabs Ratan's head in both his hands and forces it downward onto the bottom edge of the jagged window frame.

He rubs Ratan's neck across the glass: every artery, vein and capillary rip out of Ratan's neck.

Ratan collapses against the window frame.

TWO OFFICERS, guns drawn, rush toward Ratan's body. The Second Officer pulls out his handcuffs, then realizes it will not be needed.

Jake turns and heads toward where he last saw Kristen.

Slowly, burning through his face, the grainy black and white image of a girl wearing a black mask appears. A hand reaches down to pull off the mask.

Jake wakes suddenly from his dream, his screaming face double- exposed with the terrified young girl's.
