PANNING FURTHER DOWN UNTIL

The moonlight illuminates the restless, inner city streets of Miami and we start moving through them -- passing the neon lit bars with enthusiastic DRINKERS, clueless GERMAN TOURISTS, wearing shorts, black socks and sandals, long legged MODELS flirting on the boulevard, blue collar CUBANO MEN sipping espresso, a few scantily clad HOOKERS hawking johns and a band of RUNAWAYS looking for handouts --

PROUD PARENTS sit on the grass, opened picnic baskets in front of them.

Their eyes focused on two dozen BOYS (12-14) wearing snappy looking, matching shirts, singing a beautiful rendition of "Bach Magnificat."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a flourish, the tropically dressed CHOIR MASTER (40's), handsome, all-American looking, with a scrubbed clean face, guides the boys to the stunning crescendo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CROWD stands, ERUPTS with applause. The boys smile.

The Choir Master turns, bows to the audience -- more applause, then rises, blows kisses to his perky little WIFE and their TWO young DAUGHTERS standing in the front row.

FORD TAURUS STATION WAGON

He fumbles in his pocket for his keys and after a beat, the key finally enters the lock, the station wagon door opens and

as the Choir Master slides in behind the wheel, SUDDENLY --
</DIRECTION>
<A_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	POPS UP from the back seat, quicker than a jack in the box, and with incredible quickness WHIPS a fishing line around the Choir Master's neck, pulls it very TIGHT.

THE CHOIR MASTER'S EYES go wide and his face turns white.

Donovan turns the wheel and the car rumbles toward --

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car stops in front of an old, abandoned concrete cistern. To the side, is a small yard where we see THREE MOUNDS of dirt piled high.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car STOPS. Donovan stares at the mounds, then snaps his eyes shut. Dexter releases the noose.
</DIRECTION>
<DEXTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
Donovan STUMBLES out of the car, falls to the ground, starts to whimper.

	<DIALOGUE>
	You have to listen and do what I say. You should know that. It's important.

After a beat, Donovan slowly gets up and the two of them stare at each other. There's a weird understanding between the two. Dexter smiles, says softly --

they both walk up to the front door and enter --

<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. THE CISTERN - OUTSKIRTS OF MIAMI, FL - SAME

Dexter KICKS the door closed, quickly flips on a flood lamp, lights up the room, leans into Donovan's ear, whispers...
</DIRECTION>
<DEXTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look.

</DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
Donovan is too scared, tries to turn his head away --

	<DIALOGUE>
	NO! NO!

But Dexter twists the noose tighter and Donovan's SCREAMS are cut off.
</DIRECTION>
<DEXTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's horrible, isn't it? Isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
But Donovan SLAMS his eyes shut even tighter.
</DIRECTION>
<DONOVAN>
<DIRECTION>
(pleading)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONOVAN>
<DIRECTION>
Dexter GRABS the back of Donovan's neck, SPINS him around, SLAMS his face into a wall, then grabs his hair and pulls Donovan's head back.
</DIRECTION>
<DEXTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OPEN YOUR EYES AND LOOK AT WHAT YOU DID -- LOOK OR I'LL CUT YOUR EYELIDS RIGHT OFF OF YOUR FACE.

Donovan's eyes pop open wide, and we finally SEE ---
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THREE SMALL BODIES

Three little dead BOYS laid out on plastic sheets and spread out in a semi-circle before them.

</DONOVAN>
<DEXTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's good. Beg. Did these little boys beg?

</DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
Donovan SCREAMS and Dexter lets go. Donovan falls forward and lands on his face sobbing, sniveling.
</DIRECTION>
<DONOVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I couldn't help myself, I just couldn't...Please, you have to understand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONOVAN>
<DIRECTION>
Dexter looks down at him --
</DIRECTION>
<DEXTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Trust me, I definitely understand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
Then Dexter grabs him, lifts him up, stares into his eyes.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See, I can't help myself either.

<DEXTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have standards.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
And then in a flash, Dexter pulls a syringe out of his pocket, PLUNGES the needle deep into Donovan's neck. His eyes instantly roll up and into the back of his head and when we see nothing but white, he collapses onto the floor.
</DIRECTION>

Dexter leans down, picks him up by his collar, drags him up the stairs.

Flood lamps illuminate the clean, freshly prepared room. The windows are sealed with thick plastic sheets and on the table in the middle of the room --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Donovan lies naked, but his arms and legs are strapped down with duct tape. His eyes wide open and his mouth is stuffed with thick wads of white gauze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Placed strategically around the room are boxes lined with white garbage bags and on a smaller table next to the Choir Master are bottles of chemicals, small saws, drills, scalpels and knives of every shape and size. It's an unseemly display of gleaming metallic, sterile utensils.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dexter, now wearing a clean, form fitting Hazmat suit and a pair of surgical gloves, looks down at Donovan.
</DIRECTION>
<DEXTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Soon, you'll be packed into a few neatly wrapped Hefties and my own small corner of the world will be a neater, happier place. A better place.

</DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
Dexter lifts a very sharp scalpel and an eye dropper off the table, leans over Donovan and with the scalpel makes a small precise little incision on the man's forehead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blood trickles out and using the eyedropper, Dexter very carefully, sucks a few blood droplets up and into the small tube of glass.

<DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Blood. Sometimes it sets my teeth on edge.

</DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
When he sees the blood, Dexter clearly gets excited --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But after a beat, he controls himself, then very carefully squeezes the rubber top of the eye dropper over a glass slide and a few tear drops of blood gently spatter onto the slide, then he presses a second piece of glass over it, seals the two slides together --

Dexter slips the glass slide into his shirt pocket, smiles, then grabs a small surgical saw off the table -- we HEAR the whirl of its motor running and as Dexter slowly brings the saw down toward Donovan's crotch --

Dexter, back in casual clothes, stands behind the wheel of his boat, puttering past an early morning fishing boat -- a huge smile on his face.

Dexter eyes a leather-skinned FISHERMAN standing on his commercial fishing boat -- waves to him.

<DEXTER>

	Ahoy -- Ahoy there, Captain. Any big Marlin out there today?

The fisherman smiles, waves back and Dexter smiles wide.

Dexter navigates his boat out of the bay.

<DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that's my plight -- I care about people as much as I care about lawn furniture but I can't blame my foster parents for that. Harry and Doris Morgan did a wonderful job raising me. But they're both dead now.

FLASHBACK TO:

:SC: EXT/INT. BOAT - CENTRAL FL - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a beautiful, warm Sunday afternoon and the boat is anchored in the lazy bay. A bin filled with freshly caught RED SNAPPERS sits behind -- HARRY (50's), Dexter's foster father -- a diamond in the rough, tough exterior, but soft at heart -- pulls a flask out of his pants pocket, slowly unscrews the top, downs a slug of booze, then slips the flask back into his pants.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
YOUNG DEXTER (12) watches his father very carefully, then picks up a small bottle of milk, unscrews the top, takes a sip, screws the top back on, then tries to slip it into his pants -- just like his father, but it doesn't fit so he sets it aside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry stares into nothingness -- then turns to his adopted son and says very softly, simply --

Dexter walks into his apartment, closes the door behind him. It appears more like a library than a home -- book shelves are everywhere and all the books are categorized, alphabetized and lined up perfectly and in that collection, among other medical books, is a copy of Gray's Anatomy. Some of the walls are covered with framed, family photos.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dexter walks past his coffee table stacked with neat piles of Pop culture magazines and "How To.." books. In the middle of the room is a large desk with a computer on top. Dexter drops his keys and wallet on the desk, then walks to the far wall, approaches his air conditioner unit, turns it up even colder. He then pulls off the front panel of the "modified"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
air conditioner and inside we see two sets of condenser coils. Dexter pulls off one of the coils, reaches inside and retrieves a long rectangular wood box, sets it on his desk, lifts off the lid and from his shirt pocket, pulls out the slide of blood we saw him extract from Donovan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dexter stares at it for a beat, then --

<DIRECTION>
He files it amongst many other slides inside the box, slams the lid shut, then places the box back inside the air conditioner, reaches back in and pulls out a stack of files, all labeled "MISSING PERSONS: PROPERTY OF MIAMI-METRO P.D." The file on top reads: "JANE SAUNDERS." Dexter leafs through it and we see a mug-shot of a seedy looking dude, labeled "JAWORSKI."

He heads toward A CROWD OF polyester-wearing RETIREES, hand- me-down-wearing CUBANO refugees and bikini-wearing TOURISTS, standing behind the yellow police tape cordoning off this dingy low-life, hell-hole of a motel advertising hourly rates.

<DEXTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?

</DEXTER>
<DEBRA>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DEXTER>
<DEBRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hell yeah we got a serial killer, Bro - the other two were up in Broward County -- chopped up in bits and pieces too, and they say there's no connection. Any drooling moron could see these kills are connected. But that bitch...

</DEBRA>
<DEXTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What bitch?

</DEXTER>
<DEBRA>

</DEBRA>
<DIRECTION>
And Dexter turns and SEES --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LT. MARIA LAGUERTA (30's), the intensely sexy, Cuban born head of Miami-Metro homicide, talking rapid fire to a clearly nervous Cuban PORTER.
</DIRECTION>
<DEBRA>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	She's the lead on the case. How the hell does that happen?

</DEBRA>
<DEXTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's a born politician -- kiss enough ass and you get the post. Maybe you should try it sometimes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEXTER>
<DEBRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Blow me. She's convinced there's a witness and I want in on this case -- it's my beat but instead of using me, she's got some detectives I never met interviewing my whores who -- trust me -- are not going to talk to those dudes. What an idiot. Idiot. Idiot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBRA>
<DIRECTION>
LaGuerta catches Dexter's eye and in the midst of her rapid paced conversation with the Cuban Porter, smiles at Dexter, then her eyes quickly scan the crowd, the crime scene.
</DIRECTION>
<DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh oh...there's that frown and those darting eyes. Perhaps she's hoping a clue will leap out of nowhere and she can shoot it.

</DEXTER>
<DEBRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dex...DEX...Jesus, come on, what the hell am I going to do?

Dexter turns, smiles at Deb.

<DEXTER>

</DEXTER>
<DEBRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to get the hell out of this sex suit and get into the homicide division, that's what I want to do. But that ass kissing puta is gonna stick her bubble ass in the way. Shit, why does she have to hate my goddamn guts?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBRA>
<DEXTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cause you hate hers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEXTER>
<DEBRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I don't need you to reiterate the fucken obvious. Okay? Now are you going to help me?

</DEBRA>
<DEXTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just sometimes, Deb...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off her look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, let me take a look and in the meantime, avoid LaGuerta and talk to the Captain and ask him to put you on the case. But keep the sex suit on - it'll help your cause.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEXTER>
<DEBRA>
<DIRECTION>
(shakes her head)
</DIRECTION>

	Why do I love you?

<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. THE POOL - 7 SEAS MOTEL - MIAMI, FL - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dexter walks down and into the empty pool and SEES --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VINCE MASUKA (30's), slight, half Japanese, half white, sporting a shaved head, meticulously brushing the pool tiles for fingerprints.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGEL BATISTA (30's), the corpulent, chain-smoking Miami- Metro Medical Examiner, leans down and very carefully plucks out body parts which are all individually wrapped up in white butcher's paper and neatly tied with twine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Batista's last grab is clearly a foot and...Batista sets it down amongst a lot of other body parts (legs, hands, individual fingers...) on a blue plastic tarp, and like a puzzle we're beginning to see the complete human figure laid out. It's gruesome, but still, there's something...something almost intriguingly artistic about it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Masuka looks up, wipes the sweat off his brow, sees Dex and smiles with a big fake smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FREEZE ON MASUKA'S FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something's wrong with this guy, Masuka. It's like he learned how to smile from those models in a Sears catalogue.

	Nice haircut, Masuka.

<MASUKA>

(too excited)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Saw your sister. Damn...looking hot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASUKA>
<DEXTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She should. It's hot as hell out here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEXTER>
<MASUKA>
<DIRECTION>
(shrugs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what brings you here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASUKA>
<DEXTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Came to see how the real experts operate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
Masuka flashes that fake smile again, then starts laughing -- his whole body convulsing in great heaves and gasps, almost sounds like he's drowning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dexter stares at him in amazement, then --
</DIRECTION>
<DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that laugh. Do I perform CPR or the Heimlich?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
Masuka finally stops laughing.
</DIRECTION>
<MASUKA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seriously, why are you here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASUKA>
<DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
(rhetorically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a crime scene.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEXTER>
<MASUKA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but you do blood spatter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASUKA>
<DEXTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEXTER>
<MASUKA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, there's no blood here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASUKA>
<DIRECTION>
Dexter stares at him, then suddenly feels light-headed, takes a step back, something has happened. His world is clearly rocked. Finally, he recoups, focuses back on Masuka.
</DIRECTION>
<DEXTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEXTER>
<MASUKA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah...There's no blood in or on or near the body at all. It's the weirdest thing you ever saw.

</MASUKA>
<DIRECTION>
PUSHING INTO DEXTER'S HORROR STRICKEN FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DEXTER>

	<DIALOGUE>
	No blood. No sticky, hot, messy, awful blood. NO BLOOD AT ALL.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why hadn't I thought of that? No blood.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(and then his face relaxes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What a gorgeous idea.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
Dexter quickly spins around to Batista, then whips out a pair of surgical gloves, snaps them on, leans down next to Batista who's slowly unwrapping a hand with his scalpel.
</DIRECTION>
<DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How does he do it? How does the killer get rid of the blood?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEXTER>
<BATISTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hard to say. The body's in good shape and she was muy bonita. Had a big ass too. Her head's over there, take a look.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BATISTA>
<DIRECTION>
Dexter ignores that, leans in, inspects the exposed hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DEXTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is unique.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEXTER>
<MASUKA>
<DIRECTION>
(laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No shit and no prints either.

</MASUKA>
<DIRECTION>
Batista picks away until he finally reveals the tip of an ankle.
</DIRECTION>
<DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This guy's good. I've never seen such clean, dry, neat looking dead flesh. Wonderful.

Dexter looks at Batista.

<DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very clean.

</DEXTER>
<BATISTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but he didn't finish - no terminado.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BATISTA>
<DEXTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looks pretty completo to me, Angel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEXTER>
<BATISTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, look -- he cut the leg in four pieces, almost like using a ruler, but this leg is only in two pieces, and here. Looks like he started to make a third cut but stopped. Possible, he got interrupted.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BATISTA>
<MASUKA>
<DIRECTION>
(laughing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's why LaGuerta is looking for a witness. Working on that motel Porter back there. God help him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASUKA>
<DIRECTION>
Dexter looks at them both.
</DIRECTION>
<DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No blood. I can't think.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to get out of here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
Dexter rises -- takes one last look at all the marvelous bloodless body parts laid out on the tarp, then without saying anything, turns, walks away from Masuka and Batista.
</DIRECTION>
<BATISTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dex, donde vas? Where you going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BATISTA>
<DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
(spins around)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey...no blood -- no trabajo.

And Dexter climbs out of the pool and disappears behind a group of COPS standing by the squad cars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:

Dexter keeps walking, passes LaGuerta who winks at him.

<DEXTER>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wish she'd stop that. It's one of those mating rituals which I really don't understand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
Dexter ducks past a group of REPORTERS who suddenly surround LaGuerta pushing their microphones and cameras into her face, spewing questions and as Dexter looks back at the crime scene, we hear --
</DIRECTION>
<DEXTER>

CUT TO:

:SC: EXT. HOTEL - MIAMI, FL - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dexter slowly pulls to a stop near the front entrance of the hotel -- focuses on the VALET STAND where we see --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAMIE JAWORSKI (30's), a short, stocky, pleasant enough looking man, whose large brown eyes might be a little too close together, wearing a traditional valet outfit. A sleek BMW pulls up -- Jaworski opens the door and a sexy ASIAN WOMAN dressed in a skimpy tennis outfit, steps out of the car. Jaworksi watches her sashay into the hotel and as he closes the door, we SEE a large tattoo of a naked woman, but with a featureless face emblazoned across his forearm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FREEZE ON JAWORSKI

Jaworski leers at a gorgeous BLOND -- spandex outfit painted on her body, a gym bag slung over her shoulder -- as she gets out of another car and enters the hotel.

the Sergeant quickly gets up, reaches into the donut box grabs one --

Dexter smiles, heads down the glass enclosed office cubicles, passing UNIFORMED COPS -- weaves in and out of a bunch of casually dressed POLICE DEPARTMENT ADMINISTRATORS, then comes upon two veteran DETECTIVES.
</DIRECTION>

Debra reaches into his box of donuts, grabs a powdered one.

She's motherly but tough and smart. Above all, she's discreet, keeps her own counsel and everyone knows that she's been the ruler and sole gatekeeper of the Police Department's Office of Records for the past twenty years.

He reaches into his box of donuts, grabs the last one. Stares into the empty box.

The poster of Miami's, "Matador's Hockey Team," taped to one of the glass walls, but the other walls are plastered with images of blood stained walls, floors, and carpets -- looks almost like a "Jackson Pollack exhibit."

<SGT_DOAKES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about these?

Doakes shoves a few oversized color photos of A COUPLE OF BODIES, lying dead on the carpeted floor of a large hotel room into Dexter's hands.

The sliding doors on the balcony are open and hot gusts of wind whip the curtains around.

And in the middle of this suite are a couple of (what look like) tall microphone stands and -- Emanating from the top of each stand is a series of individual strings stretched across the room and pinned to the blood splattered on the opposite wall and curtains.

On the far right side of the room, the wall is almost entirely covered with one big dripping splotch of blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The left side of the room is very different.

The wall is covered with thousands of seemingly random little dots of blood, but like a Pissaro painting, when you step back and away, those abstract dots suddenly transform into a beautiful series of descending arcs, like rainbows of blood.

Dexter pins yet another string to a tiny splat of blood on the wall completing a complex maze of strings -- a massive cat's cradle hanging across the room.

Dexter looks around the house. It's small and messy, but above all, sordid. There's a paper towel holder next to the unmade bed. In the middle of the room is a desk with a computer on it and an expensive looking digital video camera. Dexter picks it up, eyes it curiously.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Why? Same guy, same pattern?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEXTER>
<BATISTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bone dry. No blood again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BATISTA>
<DIRECTION>
And Dexter suddenly feels light headed again, paces, recoups, then leans down next to Batista -- focuses.
</DIRECTION>
<BATISTA>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mira aqui -- there's a small difference in the cuts this time.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(points to an exposed hand)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very rough here. Almost emotional. Then here -- not so much, here and here and in-between.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BATISTA>
<DEXTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Muy bien.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEXTER>
<BATISTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, nice, but look at this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BATISTA>
<DIRECTION>
Batista nudges the severed hand aside, taps an exposed femur.
</DIRECTION>
<BATISTA>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look -- all bone. The killer, flayed the skin completely off. Why would he do that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BATISTA>
<DIRECTION>
Dexter takes a breath, looks at Batista.
</DIRECTION>
<DEXTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's experimenting. Trying to find the right way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEXTER>
<BATISTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is he experimenting with the head too?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BATISTA>
<DEXTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEXTER>
<BATISTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, la bestia took her fucking head. There isn't one around here and God knows what he's doing with it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BATISTA>
<DIRECTION>
Dexter stares at Batista, gets up and slowly walks away deep in thought.
</DIRECTION>
<DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's certainly raising the bar. Damn, this guy is good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. DEXTER'S CAR - IN FRONT OF RITA'S HOUSE - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car stops. Dexter and Rita sit in silence, then --
</DIRECTION>
<RITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will they catch him soon?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RITA>
<DEXTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doubt it. The killer is an artist...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEXTER>
<RITA>
<DIRECTION>
(confused)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RITA>
<DIRECTION>
But now Dexter's in his own world and without even realizing it, he slowly runs his hand over Rita's thigh, tracing out the cut marks he just saw on the bloodless body. As he speaks softly, his hand moves higher and higher up her leg.
</DIRECTION>
<DEXTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His technique...it's incredible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEXTER>
<RITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What..? Dex, I can hardly hear what you're...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RITA>
<DIRECTION>
But before she finishes, Dexter's hand is SUDDENLY way too close to Rita's crotch and a look of horror crosses her face, she PUSHES his hand away, and quickly jumps back. She then pats her dress down, frantically runs her hands through her hair.
</DIRECTION>
<RITA>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry...I don't think I want to -- I mean, I'm not ready for -- Damn it, Dexter. WHY!?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RITA>
<DIRECTION>
She unbuckles her seat belt, jerks the door handle up, jumps out of the car, SLAMS the door shut -- runs into her house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK ON DEXTER
</DIRECTION>
<DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What have I done now? I'm not even interested. And why can't I get that neat stack of body parts out of my head.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No blood.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why did I touch her that way?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
And as we push in tight to Dexter's face, we --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. LIVING ROOM - DEXTER'S APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And Dexter looks GRIM and ANGRY-- sits at his desk, faces his computer -- the large "Jaworski File" just inches from his fingers and right next to that, is the same porn magazine we saw in Jaworski's apartment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dexter pounds away on the keyboard and as the images on the computer screen reflect off his face, his shoulders tighten, and his eyes turn cold and black.
</DIRECTION>
<DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's it. He's definitely the one.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Scream Bitch Scream." The mother of all rape sites.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
PLAYING ON THE SCREEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Is a grainy video of the attractive, but the struggling, desperate Jane Saunders is tied down to a stained mattress lying on a filthy basement floor -- and humping away on top of her is -- a short, stocky, masked man with the same tattooed hands we saw on Jaworski.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's unseemly and nauseating, then it becomes pure evil as we watch Jaworski climax, reach under the mattress, pull out a knife, and as he raises it high in the air, we --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT BACK TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: THE FURIOUS DEXTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Staring at the computer -- hatred all over his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Now it's just a matter of time before he becomes a drop of blood in my glass slide collection.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I have to wait, because what I do requires infinite planning and I have to be careful and follow the code of my father.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
And as Dexter pushes back from his desk, we hear --
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that why we took this trip, Pop?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
FLASHBACK TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. CAMPGROUNDS - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sun is going down and little Dexter is helping his father build a campfire -- throws a couple of twigs into the pile.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_DEXTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To talk about this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
Harry blows into the embers, the fire ignites, then he sits down next to Dexter, turns and looks at his son.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm getting old, son, and I think when you get older, people understand things differently. Understand things in a better way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<YOUNG_DEXTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I understand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ten years ago, I would have had you committed -- but now I know better.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(gently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a good kid, Dexter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<YOUNG_DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
(sincere, distraught)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No Pop, I'm bad. I'm...
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_DEXTER>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(cuts him off)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No...You're good...You are, Dex...I know it and you know it and I know it because...because otherwise you wouldn't care what me or your mom thought -- you'd just do it. But we're not going to be here forever so we have to get you sorted out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
He stares into Dexter's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_DEXTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pop, I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_DEXTER>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(beat, then very gently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come here, son.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Harry leans over, flicks the hair away from Dexter's face.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you remember from before? You know, before we took you in?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_DEXTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_DEXTER>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good, because what happened was too strong. It got into you too early, son and it's going to stay there.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's going to make you want to kill and you won't be able to stop it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<YOUNG_DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
(sad)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, I'm going be like this forever?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_DEXTER>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, and nothing can change that -- but you can channel it. Control it. We can use it for good.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to teach you how to choose what and who you kill. Teach you how not to get caught.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This will be our secret. Just between you and me? No one else can ever know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<YOUNG_DEXTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you sure?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_DEXTER>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm absolutely sure and Dexter -- I want you to, because there are plenty of people who deserve it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<YOUNG_DEXTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you're not mad at me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_DEXTER>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, son. I love you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
As Harry smiles then pulls little Dexter into his arms, we HEAR --
</DIRECTION>
<DEBRA>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't bullshit me, Dex. Give me something before they shut me out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBRA>
<DIRECTION>
SMASH CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. JIMBO'S RESTAURANT - MIAMI, FL - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Crowded and chaotic. Dexter and Deb sit and eat.
</DIRECTION>
<DEBRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	LaGuerta's still convinced the killer was seen, too scared to finish so she still has me interviewing hookers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBRA>
<DEXTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a waste of time. Think, Deb. If he was interrupted...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEXTER>
<DEBRA>
<DIRECTION>
(cuts him off, excited)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus Christ right -- because then how'd he get the time to wrap up all the pieces? She's dumber than the boat people. Throw her a fucking raft.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBRA>
<DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
(beaming)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But now we have a fourth body and the cuts were different. It's telling us a story -- the ritual is changing... He's looking for some inspiration and he's not finding it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEXTER>
<DEBRA>
<DIRECTION>
(realizing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So he keeps doing it until he gets it right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBRA>
<DEXTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could be wrong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
But he isn't and Deb knows it, then shovels a forkful of food into her mouth and after a couple of hearty chomps --
</DIRECTION>
<DEBRA>
<DIRECTION>
(with mouthful)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, how the hell was your date last night?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBRA>
<DEXTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great. You ought to try it sometime. You need a life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEXTER>
<DEBRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need a transfer to Homicide, then we'll see about a life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBRA>
<DEXTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I understand, it would certainly sound better for the kids to say, 'Mommy's in homicide.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEXTER>
<DEBRA>
<DIRECTION>
(exasperated)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't make me hit you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBRA>
<DEXTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a natural thought. And then we can talk about nephews and nieces. More little Morgans. Why not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEXTER>
<DEBRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sound like mom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBRA>
<DEXTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm channeling her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEXTER>
<DEBRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Change the channel and tell me what you know about cell crystallization?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBRA>
<DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
(eyes her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEXTER>
<DEBRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I heard the coroner say it last night -- he was talking about the dead headless chick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBRA>
<DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
(stares at her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got that look in your eye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEXTER>
<DEBRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was there before you and I noticed the body looked different from the others. Her pieces were cold -- Like meat packing cold, so that's what I'm pondering -- Is that what cell crystallization means?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBRA>
<DIRECTION>
FREEZE ON DEXTER
</DIRECTION>
<DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My God, why didn't I think about that? It's beautiful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DEBRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dex...what are you thinking?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBRA>
<DIRECTION>
Dexter looks at his sis, sips some water.
</DIRECTION>
<DEXTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry...But it makes sense. Cold -- slows the flow of blood.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEXTER>
<DEBRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why the hell is that important?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBRA>
<DEXTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a feeling...but I think maybe he has a thing about blood.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEXTER>
<DEBRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not enough. Come on, I need to show LaGuerta and her boys.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBRA>
<DIRECTION>
Beat and then --
</DIRECTION>
<DEXTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Refrigerated truck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
Deb eyes him, leans in close, then says slowly --
</DIRECTION>
<DEBRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What-the-fuck-are-you-talking-about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBRA>
<DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
(thinking --)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A refrigerated truck. He wants a cold environment to slow the blood flow. Clean and...mobile, so he can dump the garbage afterwards.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEXTER>
<DEBRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So we're looking for a refrigerated truck now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBRA>
<DEXTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Probably a stolen one.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Think there are a lot of stolen trucks out there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEXTER>
<DEBRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You nuts? In Miami?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBRA>
<DIRECTION>
They break into smiles, then Deb gets up, kisses his head --
</DIRECTION>
<DEBRA>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Love you...thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBRA>
<DIRECTION>
And she's gone. Dexter looks around takes out a little note pad and pen and starts writing a list. "Sharpen scalpels, replace batteries in saw, change needle..."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SMASH CUT TO:

<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. DEXTER'S APARTMENT - LATER

Dexter staples thick sheets of plastic over the windowless window frames, then mops the unfinished cement floor.

Dexter SNAPS a rubber sheet over a stack of sheet rock in the middle of the unfinished room, pats it down, then cuts pieces of Duct-tape off a large roll and sticks them to the side of the sheet rock.

He sees a roll of shrink wrap, quickly whips out his filet knife, cuts up the shrink wrap, makes himself a mask, leaving is face pressed in and distorted. He quickly makes a small slit in between his lips so he can breathe. He pulls it off his face, then folds it neatly.
</DIRECTION>
<DEXTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a big fan of the little things in life.

Dex walks into the crowded main lobby, then freezes at the ight of --

<DIRECTION>
THE CHOIR MASTER'S WIFE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standing in front of the DESK SERGEANT, crying.
</DIRECTION>
<WIFE>

(patiently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ma'am, I understand -- the detectives re looking into everything and when we know...

As we pan off the Sergeant and his voice trails off, we settle --

ON DEXTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eyeing the Wife.

<DEXTER>

(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm pretty certain I made no mistakes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
Dexter turns, heads toward the briefing room, then feels a hard poke into his shoulder and stops. He spins around and tares into the face of --
</DIRECTION>
<SGT_DOAKES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I saw you staring at that woman. What do you care about her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SGT_DOAKES>
<DEXTER>

	I don't...I was just...

</DEXTER>

	<DIALOGUE>
	You like when women cry? You like that? What's your thing, psycho?

</SGT_DOAKES>
<DEXTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just heading to the briefing room.

<SGT_DOAKES>
<DIRECTION>
(hard)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got no call to be in there, so flee.

<DIRECTION>
But Dexter turns, keeps walking --
</DIRECTION>
<SGT_DOAKES>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! I'm...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SGT_DOAKES>
<DIRECTION>
With Doakes right behind him, Dexter grabs the briefing room oor, pulls it open, and we SEE --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lt. LaGuerta standing right inside. Doakes quickly regains his composure.
</DIRECTION>
<SGT_DOAKES>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (to LaGuerta)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This fucking guy doesn't belong. I'm still waiting for his spatter report on the coke head murders.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(back to Dexter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go do that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SGT_DOAKES>
<DIRECTION>
LaGuerta shoots them both a look. Dexter retreats.
</DIRECTION>
<DEXTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay. I don't want to make anyone unhappy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
Dexter turns, but LaGuerta reaches out, grabs his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<LAGUERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He can stay.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Dexter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd love your input and we'll discuss your case after the meeting -- so how about we get started?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAGUERTA>
<DIRECTION>
And LaGuerta pulls him into --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. BRIEFING ROOM - POLICE HEADQUARTERS - MIAMI, FL - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is packed with UNIFORMED COPS, DETECTIVES. LaGuerta
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
sashays toward the front of the room. Dexter spins away from Doakes, runs into a COP.
</DIRECTION>
<COP_2>
<DIRECTION>
(playfully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Dex, I got some spatter in my shorts, want a swab?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP_2>
<DIRECTION>
Dexter smiles at him, looks for a seat, slides past a few ore COPS, then SEES --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DEBRA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sitting alone in the back -- cuts through the crowd -- GRABS a seat next to her, squeezes her knee with encouragement.
</DIRECTION>
<DEXTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You ready?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEXTER>
<DEBRA>
<DIRECTION>
(confidently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm gonna shame this bitch.

</DEBRA>
<DEXTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just state your case, clean and easy, and you'll be the hero.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
And just then, Masuka slides into a seat next to Deb.
</DIRECTION>
<MASUKA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Deb, how about I give you a hundred bucks and you let me put my head between your babaloos?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASUKA>
<DEBRA>
<DIRECTION>
(right back and loud)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about I stomp on your dick?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBRA>
<DIRECTION>
Masuka starts heaving and choking with that laugh and Deb stares at him with a mixture of amazement and disgust.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON LAGUERTA AT THE PODIUM
</DIRECTION>
<LAGUERTA>
<DIRECTION>
(eyes Deb and Masuka)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, settle down. Now, has anyone tracked down our witness?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAGUERTA>
<DIRECTION>
Mumbles throughout the room. Her face tenses, she's pissed.
</DIRECTION>
<LAGUERTA>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	COME ON, PEOPLE -- SOMEONE NEEDS TO FIND SOMETHING HERE.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAGUERTA>
<DEBRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh -- Lt. LaGuerta...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBRA>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone turns -- LaGuerta looks at Deb, rolls her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<LAGUERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Officer Morgan...Didn't recognize you with your clothes on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAGUERTA>
<DIRECTION>

SILENCE. Everyone stares at Deb, then --
</DIRECTION>
<LAGUERTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Refrigerated trucks?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(dismissive)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like ice cream trucks?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAGUERTA>
<DIRECTION>
They lock eyes. It's a stand-off.

<DEXTER>

	</DIALOGUE>
</DEXTER>
<DEBRA>
<DIRECTION>
(hard, w/growing anger)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Not ice cream trucks. A refrigerated vehicle that could cause that kind of tissue damage -- A refrigerated truck that is mobile, so he'll be harder to catch -- a refrigerated truck, that might give us a lead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBRA>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone fidgets uncomfortably in their seats.
</DIRECTION>
<LAGUERTA>
<DIRECTION>
(patronizing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's very interesting -- very creative, but let's keep looking for the witness. We know, he or she is out there -- The forensic evidence, the interrupted cut, proves there was an eyewitness -- someone saw something so let's concentrate on finding that person. Okay?

</DEXTER>

But Dexter RACES out of the room and down --

Where he grabs Deb storming away. She spins and out of rustration SCREAMS --

Then she PUNCHES Dex hard in his chest.

	Ouch...Jesus, Deb...

	But he didn't say they had to listen to you.

LaGuerta turns, saunters away. Deb stares at Dex with a look of utter amazement.

Dex eyes LaGuerta and Doakes looks like he's about to pull his gun. Dex eyes him, then says evenly --
</DIRECTION>
<DEXTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I read the other reports -- all the other forensic analysis and everyone agrees. The coke-head murders had nothing to do with cocaine. It was a crime of passion. The murderer came there to kill the woman -- not the dealer. He did him quick and got him out of the way but he sure as hell took his sweet time slicing up that lady and you don't do that unless you have a long personal relationship with someone -- probably an ex- boyfriend.
	</DIALOGUE>

DOORWAY P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And we see Jaworski, struggling with a large piece of copper tubing, turning his wrench, over and over until the tubing is finally freed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sweating, Jaworski, picks up a pile of tubing, cradles it in his arms, heads for the door and as soon as he steps into the doorway, he stops -- FREEZES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SEES a picture of Jane Saunders pinned to the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then in a FLASH --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dexter, wearing a rubber apron over his clothes and his face all pressed and distorted from that shrink wrap mask is behind him -- his filet knife pressed into Jaworski's neck.

Next to him is a small table covered with a gleaming, lethal set of filet knives of various shapes and sizes.

Dexter peels the mask off his face, leans over Jaworski and stares into his eyes.

<DEXTER>

	Of course not. And now, I'm not sorry, either.

	All in all it was good night -- One less amateur film maker polluting the internet.

Just then, the beam of the headlights of a truck approaching from behind creeps up on his hand and Dexter quickly looks into his rear view mirror.

POV FROM THE TRUCK

As it bears down on Dexter's car.

DEXTER

Looks out of the passenger side window and sees --

Slowly pass him, and Dexter realizes that it's a refrigerated truck --

Sees the truck stopped ahead and --

Slams his brakes and comes to a stop and watches --

Slowly begins a three point turn, and when it stops, it's now facing --

SWERVES AND --
</DIRECTION>

A SEVERED HEAD
</DIRECTION>

Flies into Dexter's windshield. The glass CRACKS, SPIDERS and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: THE HEAD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rolls off the hood, BOUNCES onto the wet causeway and starts rolling and skipping, heading straight toward the edge of the road and coming dangerously close to falling into the water below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: DEXTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jumps out of the car, RACES after the rolling head, catches up to it, bends down and GRABS IT --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But the rain soaked, bloodless-head SLIPS through his fingers and scoots away from him. Then with a burst of energy, Dexter lunges -- GRABS it pulls it in close and tight with his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a couple of deep breaths, rises to his feet and...

Standing alone in the middle of the empty road, Dexter lifts the head up, looks into her eyes.

LaGuerta's car pulls up, headlights momentarily blinding Dexter.

<DIRECTION>
He shields his eyes, then after a beat, he sees LaGuerta get ut of her car, and lock eyes with --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Deb who smirks at her, then turns, nods to Doakes. They both get into the unmarked car and take off.

LaGuerta shakes her head, SLAMS her door shut and walks towards Dexter.

	</DIALOGUE>
</DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<RITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you like to come in?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RITA>
<DEXTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
And he steps --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. RITA'S HOUSE - MIAMI, FL - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dexter follows Rita into the living room -- she turns, faces him.
</DIRECTION>
<RITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want to lose you, Dex.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RITA>
<DEXTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay...Sure...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEXTER>
<RITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I want you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RITA>
<DIRECTION>
And with that, she opens her robe and shyly shows Dexter the simple but elegant nightgown she's wearing underneath.
</DIRECTION>
<RITA>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (nervously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	DEX...I want to make love to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RITA>
<DEXTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, okay, thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEXTER>
<RITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're welcome.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RITA>
<DIRECTION>
And Rita reaches out, slowly pulls him close. They start to kiss, then she stops, pulls back --
</DIRECTION>
<RITA>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry, the Doctor's cleared up that little problem I had.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RITA>
<DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
(hesitantly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, that's...that's good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
And they kiss and then it builds until Dexter guides Rita to the couch and as he slowly lays her down, we --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. DEXTER'S APARTMENT - COCONUT GROVE, FL - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dexter steps inside, closes the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow. Sex. How did that happen? But she seemed pleased so I guess I didn't disappoint her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
He looks around the room, all seems fine and he heads into --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE DARK KITCHEN
</DIRECTION>
<DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But that's because I don't care, and chances are if you don't care about something, you'll be better at it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
He flips on the light --
</DIRECTION>
<DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Performance anxiety must be a bitch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
And then he SEES --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BARBIE DOLL'S HEAD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scotched taped and hanging by its hair on the refrigerator door and Dexter FREEZES -- stares at the head. He's clearly tense, unnerved.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dexter slowly approaches the refrigerator, touches the Barbie head and as it swings gently back and forth, he slowly opens the freezer door and inside he finds --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BARBIE DOLL BODY PARTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Neatly stacked and tied together with little pink ribbons -- just like the bloodless bodies, sans the little pink ribbons.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a beat, Dexter's body relaxes --
</DIRECTION>
<DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I suppose I should be upset, even feel violated, but I'm not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
And then he notices --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SMALL VANITY MIRROR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stuck in one of Barbie's hands. He pulls the tiny mirror out of the doll's hand, stares into it. And we see little fragmented images of Dexter's face off the mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No...In fact, I think this is a friendly message -- Kind of like, 'Hey, want to play?'
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
Dex puts the mirror down, closes the freezer door, and as he looks down at the little Barbie head swinging on the refrigerator door again, we --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FREEZE ON DEXTER'S SMILING FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And yes, I want to play...I really, really do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEXTER>
<DIRECTION>
And on that, we --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLACK
</DIRECTION>
