GEORGE wakes up in a large, clean, modern house. He is all alone. We get the feeling that he hired someone to decorate his house. It is very nice, but doesn't seem personal to him at all.

An Otis Redding song is playing as George walks around his house in a daze, not sure how to process this. He doesn't call anybody. There's nobody in sight. We see images of him thinking about the unthinkable and the life he's lead. He sits in his office, surrounded by photos of himself at difference ages. It builds to a sequence of him going through stacks of old photos and watching videos of himself, reviewing his life, trying to make sense of what it all meant. We see clips of his good movies and his last bad movie. On the wall is a poster of a buddy film which shows him and another famous comedian. ON-SCREEN -- home video of George at college. George is hanging out with his friends. They are acting goofy, having the time of their lives. George looks very young, skinny, and carefree. Life has never been better. They play a ridiculous drinking game and laugh uproariously.

Ira sits with one of his roommates, LEO, who is also an aspiring comedian. They sit across from each other, kicking around joke ideas they have, trying to write new ones. We see an entire pitch session play out. Ira's joke pitches are all over the place. He clearly hasn't figured out what his stage persona is yet.
</DIRECTION>
<IRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was thinking about doing something about how I'm not good looking and I'm not bad looking. I'm just good looking enough that if I had a good personality, it could put me over the top. If that was the case.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRA>
<LEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, something about how the uglier you are, the better the personality you need. And the hotter you are, the stupider you can be.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEO>
<IRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had a joke once about how you never see incredibly hot, blonde, homeless women. Because someone will always take care of that kind of woman. That woman could be the dumbest person on earth and she will survive in this world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRA>
<LEO>

	Maybe something like... you can be hot and stupid and survive in the world. And you can be smart and ugly and survive in the world. The people who have trouble are the stupid, ugly people.

	They're bananas. And always broke. They got divorced ten years ago, but they both act like it just happened last week. They hate each other. They always put me in the middle of it. I always wanted them to say, "We don't want you to suffer through this, so we're just going to handle it ourselves." They never would do it. They would always make me feel their pain all the time.

I know this Orphan's Thanksgiving it's just a normal Thanksgiving for you guys, but it's a very special one for me. I'm very glad to be here.

<DIRECTION>
George and Ira are sitting at a large kitchen table. There is a computer on the table and index cards. On the floor is a corkboard.
</DIRECTION>
<IRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See, the thing I was thinking, was...you always play an immature guy. What if the joke of the movie is you're incredibly smart, intellectual and well-mannered. You just go the opposite way with it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRA>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's nothing funny about being smart. All comedy comes from immaturity. Buster Keaton, Jerry Lewis, the Marx Brothers, WC Fields, Bill Murray, Steve Martin, Charlie Chaplin. They were all immature. They were all knuckleheads. Who wants to see a smart guy live his life normally? What's funny about that? What else you got?

<IRA>

	I. .I gotta go through my notes.

	I'm thinking about taking a gig, and having a solid hit before getting into breaking new ground.

	Well we'll still write the script, right?

</IRA>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, if we can come up with an idea.

</GEORGE>
<IRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's just keep banging at it.

</IRA>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't. I've got a date.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<IRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have a date? Who do you have a date with?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRA>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This woman my agent set me up with. She raises money for this environmental group. I guess she's like a normal person. I can't live here alone in this house forever. I need something of significance in my life. So I'm gonna go out on some dates. No pressure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<IRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what you should do, just as an experiment? You should try and not fuck her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRA>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why would you say that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<IRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because you're always saying you don't know if women like you for who you are. You don't know if they like you because you have money or you're famous. Why not take some time and get to know them before ass-raping them. In a romantic way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRA>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's insulting. Don't take out your frustrations on me because you can't get laid by acting like I'm some sort of deviant. I'm an adult. I have adult sexual relationships. No one does what they don't want to do. Sex is how people decide if they like each other. I'm testing my compatibility by ass-raping them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<IRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See, you can't do it. You can't even entertain the idea of getting to know somebody for a month before sleeping with them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRA>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not true. I'm bored of sex, anyway. There is literally no body- part/orifice combination I haven't experimented with. There is nothing left to do. There is no nationalities I haven't.slept with, no age groups I haven't slept with. I'm fully ready for normal.

	<DIALOGUE>
	So, uh, I hear you raise uh money for an environmental group. That must be very satisfying.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is, because, fixing the environment is really about having enough of a war chest to sue local government and corporations so they're forced to observe the environmental statutes that are already on the books. We also try to put pressure on the government to put pressure on other countries to clean up their environmental act. You know, one dilapidated factory in China can produce more pollution than every car in America puts out in one year.
	</DIALOGUE>

	I know you're joking, but it's a very serious situation. People like you do a lot of damage to the environment. Whether it's taking a private jet by yourself, or getting driven around town limos around town or living in your gas-guzzling houses. Your carbon footprint is huge.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Me? Why do you want me to tell her?

INT. THEATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ira is performing on stage, doing his set. He's doing really well. This theater crowd is very enthusiastic about being there and gives him the benefit of the doubt on most of his jokes. As he continues his set, he gets more confident and, for the first time in the film, we think he has the potential to be a strong comic.

<IRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you. Hopefully George won't be mad if I tired the audience out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRA>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think he has anything to worry about. They always go crazy for him. Before he got famous, he used to bomb all the time. And that's when I think he was the funniest. And now that everyone knows him, it's a little too easy for him, I think. No one was funnier when the audience hated him than George. He loved it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<IRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you guys were dating right when he started doing well?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRA>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. But you always knew he was gonna do well. He had so much charisma. He would walk into a room and in ten minutes that whole room would be about him. Even before anyone knew who he was.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Where did you meet him?

George begins his act. He could not kill harder. Or look more healthy and charismatic. We can tell it is all a show for Laura. Laura is completely thrown by this turn of events. The content of George's act is meant to portray him in a more positive, sympathetic light to Laura. He talks about being sick and the lessons he learned in a very dark, hilarious, and also uplifting way. All of it is intended to make him look like he has grown up and become wiser, and someone you could trust and spend your life with.

	This town is so small and adorable. It's like out of a Demi Moore movie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Clarke's company is about forty- five minutes from here. This town seemed so perfect when we were looking for a house. There's no traffic, there's one coffee house, one bookstore, one market. No crime. But after you've lived her a few years you hunger for another coffee shop, a bigger bookstore, and a little crime. It gets so boring. And it's such a small town, God forbid you miss one of you kid's soccer games, they put the scarlet letter on you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	it can't be that bad. You live on a pretty little ranch. You have horses, a duck. It must be a nice life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We used to have so much fun. I don't think I have that much fun anymore. I don't like who I'm turning into. Is the fun over? I have to get up every morning at six, drive my kids to school and then I have 6 hours before I have to pick them up. I have to yell at them to do their homework, be a taskmaster, then I make them dinner. It takes an hour to shower them and put them to bed. And then it's 8:30 and I pass out. And it's great, but tuck. And when both kids are done with high school I'll be 49 years old, and then I'll have probably 6 very healthy years, then I'll kind of slow down and then I'll be an old woman. And that was it. And it's great, but fuck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I couldn't believe you moved out of LA. You were getting some good jobs as an actress. You got to play the bitch on Melrose Place for awhile and make out with Andrew Shue. That was pretty good. Do you miss it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Being a mom is very fulfilling, but there are other parts of me and every once in awhile I go a little crazy.

<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you go crazy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>

	You girls can go play in the other room. The Chinese have a completely different way of looking at health. They don't think doctors should attack the diseases in the body, they're all about trying to support the body and make it stronger, so the body can fight off the disease. It works. I've seen it. I wish I could find a way to mass-market Chinese medicine in this country. Someone's gonna do it and make a fuck-load of money. Because these people get old, really old. You can't kill these people.

<IRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're the only person I know who learned nothing from a near-death experience! You actually went backwards. All it did was it brought out what a prick you are, brought everything bad to the surface. I liked you better when I was sure you were gonna die.

</IRA>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not going anywhere!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<IRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everything is about you. You don't even know where I live. You've never asked me one question about my life. How much can one person talk about himself ? You never ask me shit about anything!

</IRA>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who are you to fucking judge anyone? You're not my friend, you just want my money. You just want to get your foot in the door.

</GEORGE>
<IRA>

	Because then I'd still have your car.

</IRA>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll drop it off later.

<IRA>

<DIRECTION>
INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
George lies alone in bed, alone. Eyes wide open. It's really bright in his room. George hits a button. The shades automatically close. The room goes dark. Now he's in the dark with his eyes open. He turns on the TV to go to sleep. It's the Today show. It's really happy and morning-themed. The piece on the Today show is very suburban. "How to Clean Up Clutter."

</LEO>
<IRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh man, you got jerked off on that couch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRA>
<JONAH>

INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE

George reads one from a large pack of scripts. A few pages in, he clearly doesn't like it. He puts it down, picks up another one. The large stack is clearly the ones he doesn't like.

</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. IMPROVISATION - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ira is introduced. He walks onto the stage. We see George walk to the very back corner of the club and sit down at a table by himself. On stage Ira does his act. He is much more comfortable than we have ever seen him on stage before. He is no longer searching for his comic identity. He has found a way to be himself on stage, and tells jokes which are more personal than we have seen before. Not everything kills, but when something eats it he does not seem thrown. Sometimes he seems amused.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON GEORGE He watches from the back of the room. At first he does not laugh, but then slowly starts laughing--but more at the things Ira does in between jokes. We can tell that he is proud of Ira and misses him.

<DIRECTION>
INT. SUPERMARKET -- DAY

<DIRECTION>
Ira is back behind the counter, working at the Deli with Chuck and Gail. He doesn't look too unhappy to be there.

<IRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mrs. Gail, this fine woman would like a quarf'of potato salad.

The woman moves to the other side of the counter. We reveal George standing there, holding his ticket.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you have any turkey that's hormone-free?

</GEORGE>
<IRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes we do.

</IRA>
<GEORGE>

	I thought we were writing a screenplay.

</GEORGE>
<IRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you're not a very good writing partner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRA>

INT. SUPERMARKET - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a small seating area in the supermarket where people eat food at the deli counter. George and Ira sit across from each other.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In my travels, I have learned a lot about Asia and Buddhism. And I would like to be in the moment now with you, and to tell you how sorry I am, and how much I have appreciated your friendship. And even if we are not friends in the future, I wish you well on your journey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
Ira laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<IRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That guy was a douche-bag.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRA>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But also kind of cool. It's a very weird combination.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<IRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was going to heal you with those herbs, man. You get sick again, you should call that guy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRA>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think most of what you said to me was true. And I really am sorry. I think I'm still not very healthy...in my brain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<IRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all right, man. You've been through a lot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRA>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I appreciate you trying to help me. Even though it was kind of an impossible task.

</GEORGE>
<IRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is everything going okay? How are you doing?

</IRA>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I am not doing well, but things have certainly been worse. So, I will be fine.

<DIRECTION>
(THEN)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were good the other night. I hear you're getting regular spots now.

	I'm actually going up tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRA>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? Any new jokes you're working on?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<IRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I've been trying to get off my ass and do some writing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRA>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you got?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
Ira is surprised to hear him ask this, since he has never asked this before.
</DIRECTION>
<IRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was thinking about doing a bit about how I'm not very good looking, but I'm not bad looking, but I'm just good-looking enough that if I had a good personality, it might put me over the top.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRA>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should do something about how, when you date a girl, and you feel really good and she likes you, and then you see pictures of all her ex- boyfriends, and they're all really goofy-looking guys, and it's not that you're good looking, it's just that in this psychotic girl's eyes, you're good looking?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<IRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And how all of her boyfriends look like Lou Costello.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRA>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you say Dom Deluise? it's a more current reference.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<IRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	More current? What year was Cannonball Run, 1978?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRA>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, okay. What else you got?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<IRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was going to talk about how I haven't had sex in so long, that I can't even remember my previous sexual experiences so I can masturbate to them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRA>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should say, now when I masturbate, I have to think about the last time I masturbated.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<IRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a good one. You can write.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRA>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, I always wanted to be part of the comedy field.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
As the camera pulls back, George continues to pitch Ira jokes for his act, the first selfless act we've seen him commit in the entire film. As their friendship rekindles, we...
