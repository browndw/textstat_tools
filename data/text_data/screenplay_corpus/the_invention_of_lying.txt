EXT. CAVEMAN VILLAGE - THE PALEOLITHIC ERA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small caveman community made up of five large caves, all facing out towards a crackling fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slack-jawed, yet strong and confident CAVEMEN stumble about, dragging haunches of meat, pounding the dirt with sticks, dragging the women.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE PAN OVER to a small cave. Not even really a cave at all, but a crack in the rocks barely large enough to sleep in. Stepping out of this "cave" is a small, weak, nerdy-looking caveman.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The chief caveman, set apart by the large mallet he wields, steps towards the fire and grunts loudly to mark the beginning of a caveman meeting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"Loser caveman" steps forward apprehensively, only to be met with laughter from the other cavemen. "Loser caveman" sighs and shrinks back into his sad, little cave, watching them from the shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<CHIEF_CAVEMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(grunting; subtitled)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me see beast today. Beast scary. Beast danger for caveman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHIEF_CAVEMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The rest of the cavemen look nervous.
</DIRECTION>
<CHIEF_CAVEMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If caveman kill beast? Caveman safe. Caveman have food.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHIEF_CAVEMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The cavemen grunt in understanding.
</DIRECTION>
<CHIEF_CAVEMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who kill beast?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHIEF_CAVEMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The cavemen grunt amongst themselves. The toughest of the bunch steps forward, pounds his chest and grunts.
</DIRECTION>
<CHIEF_CAVEMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grob kill beast. Good Grob.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHIEF_CAVEMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The chief notices "loser caveman" watching from a distance.
</DIRECTION>
<CHIEF_CAVEMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Loser want kill beast?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHIEF_CAVEMAN>
<DIRECTION>
All the cavemen turn and laugh at the "loser caveman".
</DIRECTION>
<CHIEF_CAVEMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Loser kill nothing!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHIEF_CAVEMAN>
<DIRECTION>
All the cavemen laugh hysterically.
</DIRECTION>
<CAVEMAN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at Loser cave! So small!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAVEMAN_1>
<CAVEMAN_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Loser dumb!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAVEMAN_2>
<CAVEMAN_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck that guy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAVEMAN_3>
<DIRECTION>
All the cavemen pick up rocks and begin throwing them at the "loser caveman", who dives out of his cave and runs around the camp, dodging their blows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CAVEMAN VILLAGE - THE PALEOLITHIC ERA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone in the village is asleep. Everyone, that is, but "loser caveman" who sleeps uncomfortably in his tiny little cave, tossing and turning, unable to get comfortable.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A stirring in the trees causes "loser caveman" to sit upright. There's something outside of the village. Something big.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly a GIANT TUSKED BOAR pushes through the trees and stands, looking quite menacing, not ten yards from the village fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"Loser caveman" is practically shaking with fear. The boar makes eye-contact with "loser caveman" and charges directly towards his tiny little cave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The giant boar runs head first into the cave opening, but the opening is too small for the beast to fit its head inside. "Loser caveman" screams like a girl.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boar backs up to strike again -- this one sure to be the end of "loser caveman" -- when a large boulder, knocked loose by the Boar's first hit, tumbles down and lands smack on the Boar's head, killing it instantly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The entire village runs out to see what has happened. The "Loser caveman" stumbles out of the cave and dusts himself off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The chief steps forward.
</DIRECTION>
<CHIEF_CAVEMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The beast! It dead!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHIEF_CAVEMAN>
<CAVEMAN_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, look at loser! He almost die! Look he scared!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAVEMAN_2>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone laughs. The Chief looks towards Loser, standing nervously near the corpse of the Giant Tusked Boar.
</DIRECTION>
<CHIEF_CAVEMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Loser, what happen?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHIEF_CAVEMAN>
<LOSER_CAVEMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(SHAMEFULLY)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Beast, it came at me. It smash my cave.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOSER_CAVEMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone laughs hysterically. WE PAN over the many laughing faces, pointing and hooting at loser caveman's cowardice. We watch as the "loser caveman's" face turns bright red, the veins in his neck pop out and his fists clench up tightly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUDDENLY WE FLY into the caveman's skull, traveling through his cerebral cortex and towards the frontal lobe of his small, homo erectus brain. Sparks are flying back and forth across his brain as his synapses fire in rapid succession.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a SMALL EXPLOSION.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We fly back out of "loser caveman's" skull -- his face contorted in rage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He interrupts everyone's laughter.
</DIRECTION>
<LOSER_CAVEMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold on one minute!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOSER_CAVEMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone stops laughing.
</DIRECTION>
<LOSER_CAVEMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Loser wasn't finished.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOSER_CAVEMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Loser caveman stands up straight and tall -- all of a sudden the Bruce Willis of cavemen.
</DIRECTION>
<LOSER_CAVEMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	After beast smash cave, Loser look at beast and say, "not on Loser's watch." Loser grab rock on ground, lift above head and smash it down... right onto motherfucker's head.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOSER_CAVEMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The entire village gasps.
</DIRECTION>
<LOSER_CAVEMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Loser kill beast.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(PAUSE)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now fuck off, Loser going back to sleep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOSER_CAVEMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The chief steps forward ominously, then proclaims:
</DIRECTION>
<CHIEF_CAVEMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Loser kill beast! Loser caveman hero!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHIEF_CAVEMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Loser steps forward, grabs the prettiest of all cavewomen and drags her towards his cave as the entire village erupts in cheer.

	<DIALOGUE>
	The world's first lie. A monumental occasion in the history of mankind.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(PAUSE)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That lowly caveman who stumbled upon the ability to lie went on to become chief of his village, married dozens of cavewomen, and passed on the lying gene to hundreds of newborn cave-children.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(PAUSE)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Over time lying spread throughout the world, sparking the eventual birth of imagination itself, story- telling, religion, and the oh-so- important polite lie, as in, "Oh Patty, have you lost weight? You look fantastic."
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(PAUSE)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The world would be a very different place if events had gone otherwise on that prolific, Paleolithic eve. If not for that night, man would have never acquired the ability to lie to himself and to others.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(PAUSE)

	<DIALOGUE>
	A world without lying would be a world without dreams. A world without pretense. A world without fiction. A world without flattery. A world very unlike our own.

UNFREEZE:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The film rewinds about thirty seconds, to the point where the chief asked what happened with "loser caveman" and the boar.

	The Beast, it came at me. It smash my cave.

</LOSER_CAVEMAN>
<DIRECTION>
AGAIN WE FLY into the caveman's skull, traveling through his homo erectus brain. Sparks are flying back and forth across his brain as his synapses fire in rapid succession...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But this time there's no explosion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We fly back out of "loser caveman's" skull -- his face contorted in rage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rage slowly fades and Loser just stands there, everyone in the camp waiting for him to say something.
</DIRECTION>
<LOSER_CAVEMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rock fall on beast. Loser do nothing. I think Loser even soil bear pants.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause; sniffing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Loser smell bad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOSER_CAVEMAN>

Everyone falls onto the ground laughing hysterically.
</DIRECTION>
<CHIEF_CAVEMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Loser biggest loser ever! Caveman, throw rocks at loser!

Everyone in the camp joins in on another round of throwing rocks at "loser caveman" as he runs around the camp, terrified and miserable.

Mark (40's), average to semi-handsome, twists and turns through stucco hallways. He knocks on apartment "9C".

JENNIFER MCDOOGLES opens, her face flushed. She's beautiful.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi. You're early. I was just masturbating.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIFER>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That makes me think of your vagina. I'm Mark, how are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A little frustrated at the moment. Also equally depressed and pessimistic about our date tonight. I'm Jennifer.

<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope this date ends in sex.

Jennifer's apartment is new-adult, as if she just found out she was an adult yet hasn't had the time or the money to complete the transition.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need to finish getting ready. While doing that I might realize I'm still horny and try to finish masturbating without you hearing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIFER>
<DIRECTION>
Jennifer heads towards the bathroom. Mark stands alone in her living room, looking around.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>

(shouting to her)

	<DIALOGUE>
	I feel awkward and I regret being early.

</MARK>
<JENNIFER>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) (shouting back)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I'm disappointed you're early and not really looking forward to tonight in general, but the thought of being alone the rest of my life scares both my mother and I equally.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIFER>
<DIRECTION>
It's completely silent for a long beat. Mark looks around, then sits on her couch.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
<DIRECTION>
(shouting to her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have an erection now because I assume you began masturbating once we stopped talking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
More silence.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
<DIRECTION>
(shouting to her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm embarrassed because I think the restaurant I've made reservations at might not be expensive enough or hip enough to impress you, but it was the best I could do because I don't make very much money. You see, I'm forty years old and have no real financial assets to speak of, I've never owned a home, and never had a significant relationship. My boss even told me today that I'm most likely going to get fired tomorrow and...

Jennifer enters the room and Mark stops talking.

Mark and Jennifer drive in silence for a beat.

<JENNIFER>

	I'm only doing this as a favor for my cousin Greg. He keeps begging me to go out on a date with you. He says you're funny.

	A cute little place called La Bonisera in West Hollywood.

</MARK>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You obviously don't have very much money but that's not necessarily a deal breaker.

<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have very little money.

</MARK>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I also don't really care about a guy who knows all the latest, hippest restaurants.

</JENNIFER>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know any of them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In fact, there are very few things in life that I care about all that much. The only things I have to offer myself or anyone else are my good looks and my affected sense of quirkiness which artistically inclined men interpret as intellect. In fact, I think my best trait is the fact that I've made very few mistakes: socially, academically, financially or romantically. I take very few risks and therefore lead a relatively happy and light-hearted existence. Mostly though, I'm a kind, sweet person with the potential of genuinely becoming a vital and interesting human being the day I take the energy I expend on hyper self-reflexivity and apply it to actual action in the reality of my life.

</MARK>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. But I enjoy the end result of the job which is money. And the hours are pretty good for the amount of money I make, which I spend on things I like, such as clothes, hiking, drinking -- even though I know it's bad for me.

INT. MARK'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mark plops into bed in his boxers. His bedroom is bland, uninspired and completely furnished by the cheapest stuff found in an IKEA catalogue.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mark flips on the TV and gets under the covers. A commercial comes on TV.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT: COMMERCIAL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A man in a suit stands next to a single can of coke resting on a small table.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, I'm Jim and I'm the spokesperson for the Coca-Cola company. I'm here today to ask you to continue buying coke. I'm sure it's a drink you've been drinking for years, and if you still enjoy it, I'd like to remind you to buy it again sometime soon. It's basically just brown sugar water, we haven't changed the ingredients much lately, so there's nothing new about it I can say. We changed the can around a little bit. See, the colors here are a little different, and we even put a polar bear on it for the kids. Also, coke is very high in sugar, can lead to obesity in children and adults who don't sustain a healthy diet, and has a Ph acidity level high enough to dissolve teeth and bones over extended periods of time. Coke also works great at removing corrosion from car batteries and loosening rusted bolts. So that's it, it's coke. Everyone knows it. It's very famous. I'm Jim, I work for coke, and I'm asking you to not stop buying coke. That's all. Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>

INSERT: Coke logo with tagline: "It's Coke. It's very famous."

THE NEXT MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mark's alarm clock blares. Groggily he rises and sighs deeply. He has nothing to look forward to today. Or any day.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELEVATOR - MARK'S APARTMENT - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mark stands in his building's elevator. The doors open and FRANK, mid-forties and bald, enters.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi Mark. How's it going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not so good. Last night I went on a date with a girl I've had a crush on for years who will most likely never call me again and I'm pretty sure I'm going to get fired today. You?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I spent the whole night throwing up pain killers because I'm too afraid to take enough to kill myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
The elevator doors open on the lobby. Mark nods at Frank.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See you tomorrow.

<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bye.

INT. MARK'S CAR -- MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Mark drives to work we take in a bit of his world.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A homeless man stands on a street corner with a sign that reads: "I don't understand why I'm homeless and all of you are not."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A business man talking loudly into his cell phone pulls up next to mark at a red light.
</DIRECTION>
<BUSINESS_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not talking to anyone on my cell phone. I only want people to assume I'm very busy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUSINESS_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
At another red light Mark eavesdrops on a couple having a loud argument in front of a coffee shop.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRLFRIEND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I woke up this morning and realized that, not only do I not love you, but that the thought of touching you sickens me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRLFRIEND>
<BOYFRIEND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The more you hate me the more I fall in love with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOYFRIEND>
<DIRECTION>
A Bus passes in front of Mark's car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON: The bus ad simply shows a can of Pepsi, and reads: "Pepsi. When they don't have Coke."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A car honks behind Mark. The man leans out of his car and yells at Mark.
</DIRECTION>
<HONKING_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Move it, fatty!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HONKING_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Mark drives forward, waving to the man apologetically as the man zooms past him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LECTURE FILMS - CAR LOT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mark parks his car and walks towards a large office building. The sign on the building reads: "LECTURE FILMS MOTION PICTURE STUDIOS -- We Film Someone Telling You About Things That Happened."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In front of the building is a man in a suit standing on his briefcase with his tie around his head, screaming.
</DIRECTION>
<SCREAMING_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This isn't natural! None of this is natural! We're all animals! This doesn't feel right! Why am I wearing clothes? How can you people live like this? Where did all this concrete come from?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCREAMING_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Mark walks right by him. A woman in a business suit stops him on his way through the front door.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN_IN_BUSINESS_SUIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want to go in there today. I just don't. You know?

</WOMAN_IN_BUSINESS_SUIT>

Mark nods understandingly and enters the building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LECTURE FILMS - LOBBY - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Mark walks through the lobby we get a brief glimpse of some of the movie posters lining the wall: "The Holocaust", "The Death of the Dinosaurs", "Napoleon", "The Civil War".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Each poster shows a different austere man sitting in a chair, holding a script in his lap, with a title above his head. The posters are extremely boring.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A tour guide leads a row of tourists through the lobby. As Mark enters we overhear the tour guide's speech.
</DIRECTION>
<TOUR_GUIDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All of Lecture Films' productions are written, filmed and edited right here on this very lot. In fact, this building is where Lecture Films' talented writers scour through the world's past events, searching for the most entertaining, dramatic and even hilarious moments of world history, which are then turned into scripts, handed over to our world-famous Readers, and filmed for your viewing pleasure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOUR_GUIDE>
<DIRECTION>
The whole tour "oohs". The tour guide walks over towards a large flat-screen television embedded into the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<TOUR_GUIDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you'll just follow me over to this monitor you'll get a sneak peak at Lecture Film's upcoming summer's blockbuster: "Napoleon 1812 to 1813."

Everyone "oohs" again. Mark, curious as well, stops to watch the trailer with the tour.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON: TV SCREEN. A black screen.

<TOURIST_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love these films. Saves me reading the book.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOURIST_1>
<DIRECTION>
INTERCUT the trailer title slamming onto the screen:

<NARRATOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Napoleon 1812 to 1813. Coming this summer from Lecture Films.

</NARRATOR>
<DIRECTION>
The trailer ends and the tour applauds. The tour guide turns to find Mark walking away.
</DIRECTION>
<TOUR_GUIDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look everyone, there goes Mark Bellison, one of Lecture Films very own screenwriters!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOUR_GUIDE>

The whole tour turns towards Mark. Mark turns around and dejectedly waves.

	He's one of our least successful writers here at Lecture Films.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mark walks past cubicle after cubicle until he comes to his office and SHELLEY, his attractive late-20's receptionist.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi Shelley. I'm still attracted to you today.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<SHELLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi Mark. Everyday I realize more and more how over-qualified I am for this position and how incompetent you are at yours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELLEY>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Any messages?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<SHELLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anthony's coming by within the hour to see if he can work up the courage to fire you. If he can't, he said he'll definitely do it tomorrow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELLEY>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nobody else called? No calls to do with actual work?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<SHELLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I told everybody you were getting fired this week and not to expect their calls returned, so no one left any messages.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELLEY>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Next time I'd rather you took down the messages just in case I don't get fired.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<SHELLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're almost definitely getting fired.

INT. LECTURE FILMS - MARK'S OFFICE - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mark's office is completely boring and unremarkable, much like his apartment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a knock on his door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANTHONY enters, looking very much the boss in his expensive suit, yet nervous and fearful as well.
</DIRECTION>
<ANTHONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow, you look really depressed today. That's going to make this so much harder.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTHONY>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anthony, don't fire me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
Anthony sits down on the other side of Mark's desk and leans forward.
</DIRECTION>
<ANTHONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mark, the 1300's are boring. Nothing interesting happened in that century. Nobody cares about the post-Roman, pre-enlightenment era. The last few scripts you turned in were depressing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTHONY>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They were about the black plague! It's the 1300's Anthony, what else am I going to write about!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<ANTHONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not totally your fault, Mark. You got stuck with a bad century.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTHONY>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! I can make it work!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<ANTHONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give it up Mark, it's not like something new is going to have happened in the 1300's. At Lecture Films we're no longer interested in searching through the less well- known historical periods for great events, we just want to take the big name Reader's of the day and have them read the historical events that people know and love: the holocaust, D-day, the birth of electricity. These are the stories people want to see, because they know them. They find comfort in them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTHONY>
<DIRECTION>
Anthony pauses.
</DIRECTION>
<ANTHONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you think I could come back and do this tomorrow? I just got very nervous about firing you. I don't do well with confrontation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTHONY>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is there anyway you could do it now? I'd rather not put it off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>

Anthony thinks for a moment, struggling to find the courage.
</DIRECTION>
<ANTHONY>

	You're fired?

</ANTHONY>
<MARK>

	Damn.

Anthony slinks out of the room. Mark looks down at his computer to see he has an email in his inbox.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON: MARK'S COMPUTER -- The email reads: "I woke up this morning, sober, and realized that, while I did enjoy your company, based on your looks, your financial situation and your position in life, I have no interest in you romantically. I'm just too far out of your league. -- JENNIFER"

Mark sits back in his chair and sighs deeply.

With all of his meager belongings stuffed into a box, Mark leaves his office, stopping in front of Shelley's desk.

Mark heads towards the elevator and is stopped by ROB MARLOWE, a little weasel man with a hip haircut and expensive clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So they fucking fired you, huh dipshit? I always knew the Black Plague would never work as a movie. Guess the 1300's were as much of a loser as you are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please don't make me feel worse. Or actually whatever, go ahead, I don't think I could possibly feel worse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I fucking always hated you. You're a shitty writer assigned to a shitty century and you're a little man bitch. But I was always threatened by you because I knew there was something different about you that I didn't understand and I fucking hate things I don't understand. But you will always be a loser and I will always be more successful than you in nearly every way. That's just the way it is. And Shelley calls you an ass fag behind your back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, now I feel worse.

Mark flicks on the TV with the remote. Static fills the screen. He changes the channel and a picture comes into view.

	See, you had it on the wrong channel. It needs to be on channel three in order for the satellite to work.

	I'm just so tired of life. Why does life have to be so... what's the word? Don't you sometimes wish you could change things? Don't you sometimes wish you weren't such a loser?

	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think I'm a loser.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTHA>
<MARK>

	Of course you're a loser, grandma. Our family is made up of losers. We're all poor, we're all average looking, we're all only moderately intelligent, we're all lonely and unloved.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<MARTHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, we're poor because we weren't born with money and it's very hard to make enough money in a single lifetime to move from one social class to another. We're only moderately intelligent because there's been a lot of inbreeding in our lineage. And we're only lonely and unloved right now. Remember, I've had two husbands I loved very much in my lifetime. And maybe one day you'll have a wife that you love very much too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTHA>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but I'm not talking about the past, Grandma. I'm talking about right now. And right now we're both losers, Grandma. We're both shitty, shitty losers. Don't you know that?

	I suppose we are. But things could be worse. We could be homeless.

Mark tosses the alarm clock across the room and goes back to bed.

</LANDLORD>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I've got about three hundred dollars in my bank account.

</MARK>
<LANDLORD>

</LANDLORD>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>

</MARK>
<LANDLORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then you're evicted. I'll help you with your things.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDLORD>
<DIRECTION>
A stunned Mark stands helpless as the Landlord pushes past him, grabs a lamp from his living room and carries it out into the hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDLORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help me with the couch. It looks heavy.

Mark sighs and follows the Landlord back into his apartment.

<BANK_TELLER>

	</DIALOGUE>
</BANK_TELLER>
<MARK>

	I'd like to make a withdrawal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<BANK_TELLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, sir. I'm confident I can help you with that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BANK_TELLER>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've just been evicted from my apartment so I need to withdraw what I have left in my account so I can move my things out. I guess I need to close out my account to do that.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(PAUSE)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I'm about to be homeless.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON MARK: This sinks in.
</DIRECTION>
<BANK_TELLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Unfortunately sir the system is down right now so I'm not going to be able to perform an account closure until the system is back up. But I can assist you in a withdrawal. How much would you like to withdraw?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BANK_TELLER>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'd like to withdraw eight hundred dollars.

The bank teller smiles at Mark.

<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All of it. Just whatever is left.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<BANK_TELLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The system is down, sir. Please tell me how much you have in your account?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BANK_TELLER>
<DIRECTION>
At the peak of his despair something suddenly comes over Mark. His face turns a light shade of red as the wheels begin to spin in his brain. He is fighting something within.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE FLY into Mark's skull, traveling through his cerebral cortex and towards the frontal lobe of his brain. Sparks are flying back and forth across his brain as his synapses fire in rapid succession.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a small explosion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We fly back out of Mark's skull -- his eyes are locked on the Bank Teller's like a deer in the headlights.
</DIRECTION>
<BANK_TELLER>
	<DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I have eight hundred dollars in my bank account.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
The teller locks eyes with Mark... then looks towards her computer.
</DIRECTION>
<BANK_TELLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a second here. The system just came back up.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to co-worker)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	System seems to be back up, guys.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Mark)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just one second while I access your account. You said you're withdrawing eight hundred, correct?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BANK_TELLER>
<DIRECTION>
Mark breaks out in a cold sweat.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yup.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
The bank teller types on her keyboard.
</DIRECTION>
<BANK_TELLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, look at this. It says here you've only got three hundred dollars in your account. But you said you wanted to withdraw eight hundred?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BANK_TELLER>
<DIRECTION>
Mark doesn't know what to say. He tries to speak but nothing comes out.
</DIRECTION>
<BANK_TELLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I apologize for this sir, but it seems our system has made a mistake. Hold on one second while I go and get your eight hundred dollars. Did you want that in large or small bills?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BANK_TELLER>
<DIRECTION>
Mark gulps.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Large bills.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>

The teller walks away. Mark looks around nervously, awkwardly smiling at the other tellers.
</DIRECTION>
<BANK_TELLER>

(to co-worker)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guys the computers seem to be a bit buggy. Will someone call James to come in and look into it, please?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BANK_TELLER>
<DIRECTION>
Moments later the Bank Teller returns and begins counting out eight hundred dollars for Mark. Mark stares at the money with wide eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<BANK_TELLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There you are. Eight hundred dollars. Anything else I can do for you today?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BANK_TELLER>
<DIRECTION>
In shock, Mark shakes his head. The bank teller smiles big at him.
</DIRECTION>
<BANK_TELLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sometimes our computers can get a bit buggy, especially when the system goes down. Sorry for any inconvenience.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BANK_TELLER>

Mark stops himself. Something else takes over within.

The table cheers for Mark. Some people are a bit confused, and a slight hubbub arises in the background: "I thought I had chips on the table." "Yeah, me too." "We must be drunk." "That guys is lucky!" Even the dealer looks a bit confused... but gets over it quickly.

</MARK>
<GREG>

	Well, here's what I'm thinking. We take all the money in the world... and put it on black.

</GREG>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why put it on black? Why stop there? Put it on a number and get thirty five times back.

Greg's eyes widen at the thought.

<GREG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's exactly what we'll do.

	Well, they'd just have to.

	Well, they can't because we've got it all.

</MARK>
<GREG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, they'd better find it. They can't let us bet if they're not going to pay us back. They'll have to just give us the casino.

</GREG>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We already own the casino. We've got all the money in the world. We'll be betting against ourselves.

	I'm as excited as I've ever been in my entire life, and equally scared. I'm writing this down in a letter in case this thing I've discovered somehow ends up killing me.

</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, to explain my invention. In essence, my creation is the act of saying words that simply are not. For example, if I tell someone that my eyes are blue, then it simply becomes fact. I still know that, indeed, my eyes are brown, but no one else is aware of this fact, so therefore I have blue eyes. It's a game of numbers: there is only one of me who knows I have brown eyes, and so many of them who do not. The numbers always win.

Suddenly Mark jumps and runs to his kitchen table. He grabs a pen, pulls out a sheet of paper... and begins writing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SERIES OF JUMP CUTS: Mark writing furiously throughout the night, piling up page upon page. By the time the sun comes up Mark is exhausted, with barely the energy to keep his head up as he writes "the end" and places the final page on his large stack of finished pages.

Mark runs to the curb and throws his manuscript onto the dirty, filthy street. He gets down on his hands and knees and rubs his manuscript into the grime, making sure to get every page equally filthy.

	On the very first day of the fourteenth century, a momentous occasion occurred. It began as a day much like any other. The sun rose, the people awoke, workers began to work, babies began to cry.

	And then the ninja army unleashed a giant fireball that brought the robot dinosaur to its knees, saving Mars, Earth and the Nude Amazonian Alien Women all in one sweeping motion. The earth was saved. Jebediah and Aleena were allowed to marry by alien king Xardon. It was to be the First Human-Nude Amazonian Alien Woman wedding, and no expenses would be spared. All of Babylon and Mars were invited to join in the celebrations.

	<DIALOGUE>
	The wedding was held on a brisk summers day on Mars, with all of the survivors of the Great Ninja War and the Black Plague present. They feasted and danced and laughed and it was a joyous occasion. The moment the bride and groom kissed, King Xardon performed a mind-wipe on all of the humans, thereby erasing all knowledge of these events from their minds, and sent them back to Babylon. For seven hundred years these events would be forgotten by mankind until one day, a great writer by the name of Mark Bellison, would stumble upon them in the desert, after being fired by his shit boss Anthony and mocked by Rob and Shelly, two huge douche bags. Lecture Films Motion Picture Studios would go on to make the picture and it would be a big success, and Mark would become very wealthy and famous from it. The End.

	I'm sorry. It just doesn't look good. She's suffered a major heart attack and her heart is very weak, her pulse not very strong, her blood pressure is dropping rapidly and most likely she'll have a fatal heart attack during the night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
The doctor checks Martha's chart.
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yup, still going to die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Mark sits down next to Martha, in total shock.
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, guys. I wish I felt something for you two, but I really don't. I do this exact thing about thirty times a night and it's really hardened me to human suffering. On a side note, it's fajita night at the cafeteria downstairs. You might think about grabbing a bite to eat there after your grandma dies.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
The doctor leaves. Mark holds his grandmother's hand, her hand is shaking.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm so scared, Mark. I don't want to die. You know, people don't talk about it much, but death is a horrible thing. One minute you're alive, there's a whole world around you, humming and jumping, people coming in and out, doors opening and closing, love and anger and the whole mess of it all, and then like that, it's all gone.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(CRYING)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is it Mark, only a few hours left of this until an eternity of nothingness.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTHA>
<DIRECTION>
The wheels in Mark's head are spinning again. Suddenly the heart monitor starts beating rapidly and Martha lurches in pain.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grandma!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
Mark immediately slams on the big red "call nurse" button, holding his grandmother down as she lurches in pain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seconds later three nurses burst into the room.
</DIRECTION>
<NURSE_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's seizing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NURSE_1>
<DIRECTION>
Nurse #2 begins filling a syringe. Mark sits by his grandmother's head, they're both looking right at each other.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm scared.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTHA>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen closely to me, Grandma. I have a surprise for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
We focus on Mark and his grandmother, inches from one another as the paramedics busy themselves around Martha's dying body.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're wrong about what happens when you die. It's not an eternity of nothingness.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
Martha is hanging on to every word Mark is saying.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When you die you're going to go to your favorite place in the whole world. And you're going to be with all of the people you've ever loved and who have ever loved you. And you're going to be young again, and you'll be able to run through the fields and dance and jump, and there will be no sadness, no pain, just love and laughing and happiness. There will be ponies made of gold, and everyone will live in giant mansions, and everything will smell like cookies. And it will last for an eternity, Grandma. An eternity.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
Tears are rolling down Martha's face as a glimmering smile overtakes her face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mark looks up to see the nurses, paramedics and doctors all staring at Mark in total shock.

Everyone distractedly goes back to helping the grandmother.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're going to be happy forever, grandma. I promise you. Say hello to my mom for me. Tell her I love her.
	</DIALOGUE>

Again, everyone has stopped helping Martha, they're all listening intently. Some of them are crying.

Martha stops breathing. The machine flatlines. And with that Martha is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn it.

<DIRECTION>
Mark turns away from his grandmother. Standing outside in the hallway is Jennifer, watching Mark with true empathy in her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MARK'S CAR -- MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mark and Jennifer pull up in front of Jennifer's apartment. There is a long beat of silence.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm so sorry, Mark.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIFER>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I just did something bad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<JENNIFER>

<DIRECTION>
Mark nods his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JENNIFER'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mark and Jennifer sit side-by-side on her couch. Mark holds a can of beer in his hand, gently turning it around in his palm, staring down at it vacantly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jennifer sadly watches Mark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly and almost absentmindedly, Jennifer's hand moves over and rests gently upon Mark's wrist, settling there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hold on them for a long beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO BLACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE UP:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE NEXT MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mark and Jennifer have fallen asleep in the exact same position, both of them sitting side-by-side no the couch, her hand still on his wrist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mark opens his eyes and looks down at her hand, then up at Jennifer who slowly opens her eyes and smiles at him.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIFER>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
They share a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MARK'S CAR - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bleary eyed Mark drives home from Jennifer's. As he turns onto his street he finds hundreds of cars blocking the way. A massive crowd of people are leaving their cars and walking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mark gets out of his car to find a wild scene: hundreds of people camped out on the lawn of his apartment building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standing by his door is the NURSE from the hospital. She immediately points at Mark and screams.
</DIRECTION>
<NURSE_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There he is!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NURSE_1>
<DIRECTION>
Mark is bum-rushed by a question-asking throng. All of them are pelting Mark with questions, all of them confused and hopeful and desperately looking for answers.
</DIRECTION>
<PERSON_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is there only one place you go when you die?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PERSON_1>
<PERSON_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will everyone who has ever died be there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PERSON_2>
<PERSON_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's this place called?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PERSON_3>
<PERSON_4>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will I get to have sex with people there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PERSON_4>
<DIRECTION>
Mark pushes through the crowd, overwhelmed by it all. He gets to his door and opens it, only to have the Nurse step in his path and block the door.
</DIRECTION>
<NURSE_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You owe us an explanation. If you know something this important, you better tell us all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NURSE_1>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who are you people?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<NURSE_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The words you spoke last night, to your grandmother, spread like wildfire. Please, tell us more. Explain what you said.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NURSE_1>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine, fine, just give me a minute.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
Mark pushes past her and into his building, closing the door behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MARK'S APARTMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mark goes to his fridge and pulls out a beer. His mind is reeling. As he opens a drawer to get a bottle opener he sees the letter: "MY INVENTION". Mark eyes it ominously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The phone rings. Mark screens the call.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNIFER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (leaving message)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've been gone for twenty minutes and I turn on the T.V to see you on every station. What's going on? This is seriously the weirdest thing...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIFER>
<DIRECTION>
Mark picks up the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Remember last night when I said I think I did something bad? Well now I know I did something bad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're saying that you know something different about what happens after you die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIFER>
<DIRECTION>
Mark walks into his bedroom and turns on the TV. Sure enough there's a newscaster on his lawn, giving a report, with a banner on the screen that reads, "New Death Discoveries".
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
Mark puts down the phone and listens to the T.V.
</DIRECTION>
<REPORTER>
<DIRECTION>
(ON T.V)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twenty-four hours ago, Mark Bellison was just your typical nobody writer. Today, people are saying he knows new information about what happens after you die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REPORTER>
<DIRECTION>
Mark puts the phone to his ear again.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mark, what do you know? What did you tell your grandmother last night? What's going on?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIFER>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't explain it all right now. Why don't you come over?

<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.

</JENNIFER>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MARK'S APARTMENT BUILDING - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jennifer pushes through the throng of people, which is now even larger than before. As she reaches the door Mark opens it for her and slides her through.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come up quick, they look like they could get out of hand any second.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
Mark hurries Jennifer into the elevator.

INT. MARK'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jennifer sits on the couch while Mark, agitated beyond recognition, paces the room.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just tell me what you told your grandmother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIFER>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think I should. Who knows what could happen next? I'm just going to keep my mouth shut from now on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What you said obviously affected a lot of people. I don't think you have the choice to keep it in now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIFER>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure I do. I could just walk out that door and get on a plane and go to Namibia. No one knows me in Namibia.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just tell me what you said. Please, Mark.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIFER>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My grandmother was dying, and she was terrified, shaking all over. She didn't want to just become nothingness. So I told her that when she died there wouldn't be nothingness. That she would be with all of the people she loved who had died and that she would live an eternity of joy and happiness.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
Jennifer's heart skips a beat.

<JENNIFER>

(barely able to speak)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you know these things?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIFER>
<DIRECTION>
Mark sighs and looks out the window. The crowd extends down the block, all of them sitting calmly on his lawn, talking quietly to each other, trying to make sense of it all.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jennifer gets up and stands beside Mark.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have to tell them everything you know. This is too big. You have no choice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIFER>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you don't understand. The words I said... they weren't... it's not right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did your grandmother feel when you told her these things?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIFER>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Happy. At peace.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And how did that make you feel?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIFER>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<JENNIFER>
<DIRECTION>
(sweeping her hand over the crowd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Think how good it will feel to do the same for all of these people.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIFER>
<DIRECTION>
Mark thinks this over.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. But I need a few hours to get my thoughts together.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll go tell them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIFER>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait! Are you sure this is right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course it is. You know something that's going to change mankind forever. It's the most important thing the world has ever heard.
	</DIALOGUE>

Jennifer leaves the room. Mark, alone with his thoughts, sits down at his kitchen table, pulls out a few sheets of paper, grabs a pen and starts writing.

<DIRECTION>
Mark is hunched over his table writing. There's a knock at the front door. Greg walks in with a large pizza and beer.

<GREG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I brought pizza. How come you never told me we all get mansions?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREG>
<MARK>

Jennifer comes out of the bedroom and quickly "shhh's" Greg.

Jennifer pulls Greg away from Mark. Mark goes back to work.

	In Seoul Korea, they wait. In Rome, Italy, they wait. In London, England, they wait. In New York City, they wait. The world has come to a standstill, everyone at their televisions and radios, or here on this lawn, waiting for Mark Bellison to come forth and tell the people what he knows.

Greg grabs an empty pizza box off of the counter, rips it into two pieces and tapes his two pages onto them.

Mark holds the two halves of the pizza boxes awkwardly and nods his head.

His voice echoes through the neighborhood.

You could hear a pin drop. No one is even breathing.

Greg, dressed in a bathrobe and looking even more slovenly than Mark, waddles up behind him.

EXT. MARK'S MANSION - POOLSIDE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mark and Greg are shit-faced, sitting around Mark's giant swimming pool.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, watch this.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(yelling over the fence)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	HEY PEOPLE!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
About forty voices shout back: "He's talking to us!" "Maybe he has more answers!" "Finally!"
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The man in the sky just told me something!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
Mark snickers to himself. Greg, drunk and stupid, can't help but snicker too.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're all gay!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
Mark and Greg explode laughing. From the other side of the fence we can hear people mumbling shock. "I am gay." "I always knew it." "This is going to be awkward for my husband."
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And adopted!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
Mark and Greg almost roll into the pool they're laughing so hard. The people on the other side of the fence aren't laughing: "Who's my real mother?", "This explains so much", "Dad, why didn't you tell me?"
</DIRECTION>
<GREG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know why we're laughing. It's really probably very sad for those people.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREG>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm gettin' a beer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
Mark hobbles up and walks into the house. Moments later he emerges with two cokes.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Out of beer. Just Coke.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
Mark tosses Greg a Coke and sits down on his chaise lounge, cracking open his Coke and taking a sip.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to do something big again. Like telling the people what happens when they die. That felt good. I gotta do something big like that again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<GREG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe the Man in the Sky will tell you something new.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREG>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
Mark looks down at his can of Coke.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON COKE CAN: The warning label is extremely long and written in very small type. It starts with, "COKE IS VERY BAD FOR YOU. The following are diseases, physical ailments and general health issues that coke might cause:"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The label then goes on to list dozens of ailments. Mark's eyes scan down to the very bottom of the label where it says simply, "If you still want to drink Coke, do so at your own risk."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mark looks over to find Greg staring at the depressing label as well.
</DIRECTION>
<GREG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ugh, this shit is so bad for you. I really shouldn't drink this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREG>
<DIRECTION>
Mark stares at this label for a moment, thinking. With his hand he covers everything on the label except for "Please Enjoy Coke."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He smiles widely.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Greg. What if I told you that drinking Coke was good for you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
Greg turns to him, his face full of hope.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And not just Coke. But all the delicious foods you're not supposed to eat. What if they were all of a sudden really, really good for you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<GREG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It would be the happiest day of my life.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A dozen high powered executives from all over the globe sit around a massive board room table. The head seat at the table is unoccupied.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They mumble back and forth to each other, unsure why they're there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mark bursts into the room in a suit, looking very manicured.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gentleman, thank you all for coming here on such short notice. I have some very big news for you all today.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<EXECUTIVE_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it from the Man in the Sky?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXECUTIVE_1>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nope, this one I came up with all on my own. And it's going to change the way you all do business... forever.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
Mark hits a button and a projection screen comes down on the far wall. Mark starts a slide show.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Up until now, all products sold worldwide have warning labels printed on them. Warnings like these.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
SERIES OF SLIDES: We see the same warning we just saw on the Coke can, a commercial jet with "This Plane Might Crash -- Four Of Our Other Ones Did" printed on its side, a car dashboard light reading "This Car will Ignite Upon Impact - Always", and a sticker on a grocery store package of ground meat that reads "Injected with hormones that make it taste better -- but will eventually give you cancer".
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As you can see, a lot of these products can be very depressing. They remind people of all the horrible things that can happen to them in life. People hate thinking about horrible things.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<EXECUTIVE_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but they have to know those things. They have to be able to protect themselves. I don't want to hurt anyone. Especially now that I know about the "bad place".
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXECUTIVE_2>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone in the room shudders.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hear me out, fellas. Allow me to introduce you to the future of your companies.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
Mark changes the slide to a can of coke that simple reads, "Coke -- Tastes Great! And It's Good For You!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone in the room "ahhhs".
</DIRECTION>
<EXECUTIVE_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where can I get some of that healthy coke?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXECUTIVE_3>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the same Coke as before.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
The executives all squint their eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<EXECUTIVE_4>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But this one is healthy! And it tastes great!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXECUTIVE_4>
<EXECUTIVE_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you have any samples?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXECUTIVE_1>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guys, it's the same Coke on the inside. I've just changed the outside.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<EXECUTIVE_1>
<DIRECTION>
(REVELATION)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Somehow by changing the outside, he's also changed the inside!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXECUTIVE_1>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone "aaahs" in understanding. Mark sighs and changes the slide to that of a commercial airliner with the words "Completely Safe" writing on the outside.
</DIRECTION>
<EXECUTIVE_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, thank goodness. I've always hated flying!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXECUTIVE_2>
<EXECUTIVE_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me too!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXECUTIVE_3>
<EXECUTIVE_4>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What an invention! How did you do it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXECUTIVE_4>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't do anything, guys. I made this on my computer last night. The plane is exactly the same as it was before.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
Nobody in the room gets it.
</DIRECTION>
<EXECUTIVE_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the only plane I'll ever fly on again!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXECUTIVE_1>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the point here guys. With these new advertising strategies, people will buy your products with abandon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<EXECUTIVE_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But it will take years to replace all of our stock with these new improved products you've invented.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXECUTIVE_2>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. It won't. All you have to do is print these words on the packaging. That's it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
Mark changes the slide again: The car dashboard light now reads, "This Car Prevents Crashes", and another slide that shows a package of meat with a sticker reading, "This Meat Actually Cures Cancer".
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Even if you don't understand it, just start shipping these products out to people as you see them here and you're all going to get very, very rich.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<EXECUTIVE_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did you do it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXECUTIVE_3>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, they're still the same products you have on the shelves right now. The only difference now is that people won't get bummed out or scared when they use them. Isn't that a good thing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
The executives all nod their heads in agreement and rise to shake Mark's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gentleman, if you'll excuse me, I have five thousand gay orphans on my front lawn that are going bananas.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
Mark exits.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SUPER MARKET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We follow a suburban housewife as she pushes her shopping cart through the aisles of a bright and shiny super market.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She picks up a six pack of Coke and notices the label: "New Coke -- It Tastes Great! And it's Good For You!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The housewife smiles widely and enthusiastically tosses it in her cart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SERIES OF CUTS: The housewife grabbing different products, marveling at the new, improved features: "Cures Sadness!", "Tastes Better than Real Chicken!", "This Candy is All Your Body Needs To Survive!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a full cart the housewife wheels it to the checkout counter to find swarms of people already there, all of their carts bursting to the brim with new, exciting products.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone looks excited and happy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BAR - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Back at his old stomping ground, Mark sits at the bar by himself drinking coffee and watching the TV.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Greg sits next to him, with two boxes of cookies and a liter of coke in front of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Different newspapers are spread out on the bar, all of them with similar headlines, "World Rocked By New Healthy Products", "People Everywhere Line up for Guilt-Free Treats", "YOU CAN EAT CAKE -- ALL THE TIME!".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON TV: A FAT MAN is being interviewed in front of a super market, he holds a bag full of junk food in front of him.
</DIRECTION>
<FAT_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank the Man in the Sky for this. I've never been happier in my life. Now I can eat whatever I want, whenever I want.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAT_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
The man takes a bite of a Twinkie and wavers a bit like he's going to pass out.
</DIRECTION>
<REPORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you all right, sir?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REPORTER>
<DIRECTION>
The man steadies himself.
</DIRECTION>
<FAT_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. I must just be real happy. It says on the wrapper that they help boost your happiness.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAT_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
The man smiles, but he's obviously not feeling well.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK ON MARK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's watching the TV with a bit of worry on his face. He turns to Greg who is eating a stack of cookies and washing it down by gulping from a liter of coke.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should slow down there, Greg.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<GREG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREG>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just because the package says it's not bad for you doesn't mean you have to gorge yourself on it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<GREG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But it tastes so good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREG>
<DIRECTION>
Greg shoves three more cookies into his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's just stupid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<GREG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No it's not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREG>
<DIRECTION>
Greg holds up the package of cookies and points to the disclaimer which reads, "These cookies make you smarter".
</DIRECTION>
<GREG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREG>
<DIRECTION>
Mark sighs.
</DIRECTION>
<GREG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You look sad. Here, have a brownie. They'll cheer you up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREG>
<DIRECTION>
Greg hands Mark a brownie that, sure enough, says "They'll cheer you up!" right on the package.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wish that worked for me, Greg.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<GREG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREG>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nevermind. I'll see you around.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
Mark gets up and leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MARK'S CAR -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mark drives while we take in a bit of his world, highlighting the various changes he's wrought.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A homeless man stands on the street corner with a sign that now reads, "Screw it. I'll be in my mansion soon." He has a big smile on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The same business man pulls up beside Mark's car, this time eating a giant donut and talking loudly into his cell phone.
</DIRECTION>
<BUSINESS_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not talking to anyone on my cell phone. But from a distance I look very important and busy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUSINESS_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
At a red light Mark eavesdrops on the same arguing couple.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRLFRIEND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I won't move into your mansion with you when we die. You're really smothering me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRLFRIEND>
<BOYFRIEND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The more you push me away, the more attracted I am to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOYFRIEND>
<DIRECTION>
A bus passes in front of Mark's car. The ad now reads, "Pepsi. Just As Good as Coke."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A car honks behind Mark. The man leans out of his car and yells at Mark.
</DIRECTION>
<HONKING_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Move it, fatty!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HONKING_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
As the man passes him, he looks at Mark and pulls up beside him.
</DIRECTION>
<HONKING_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey you're Mark Bellison!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HONKING_MAN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. So are you going to apologize?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<HONKING_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HONKING_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
The honking man speeds away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GRAVEYARD - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mark sits in front of the gravesite of his grandmother.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON: Her tombstone which reads, "Martha Bellison 1918- 2007. Lived an average life for a woman in her time."
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing's really changed. I gave people the Man in the Sky, made myself rich and successful, told the world they can eat whatever they want and feel good about it. Everyone's happy but me. Because I'm the only one who knows it all... isn't. I made it all up.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(PAUSE)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not up there living in a mansion. You're right here. In the ground. That's all. And I'm the only one who knows that.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(PAUSE)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the one thing I want I can't have. Because the world is too stupid to change. The world only cares about what they can see, and what they can know, and what they're used to and what... makes sense. No one listens to what they really want. And that's why I'll always just be a loser, grandma. And that's why I'll always be alone.

FADE TO:

INT. MARK'S MANSION - KITCHEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a beer bottle in his hand Mark searches through his kitchen drawers for a bottle opener. He opens a drawer and something catches his eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON: The envelope which reads, "MY INVENTION".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly Mark pulls it out of the drawer and stares at it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of his front door opening startles him and Mark shoves the envelope into his back pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<JENNIFER>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)

	Sure.

Jennifer enters the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Haven't seen you much lately.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. I've been busy with work and things. And I'm getting married. That's why I came over. To tell you.

Mark nods.

Jennifer pulls out an invitation, Mark waves it away.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope you'll come.

Mark shrugs and Jennifer puts the invitation back in her purse.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No point really.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It would make me happy. Being around you makes me happy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIFER>
<DIRECTION>
Mark turns towards her.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So don't marry him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I only have a few years to marry someone with good genes and financial stability so I can have children and the family I've always wanted. One day I'll be old and wrinkly and ugly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIFER>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No you won't. Not to me you won't. I love you. If you really love someone it doesn't matter what they look like.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIFER>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do me this favor. Just one favor. Don't accept everything you see. Don't just do something because that's the way it's done.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're confusing me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIFER>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Think about what you want. Find out what you really want. And if it's not the same as what I want, well then I'll know that and I'll never darken your doorstep again.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(PAUSE)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want you. What do you want?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
Jennifer and Mark stare at each other for a long beat.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIFER>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please don't. Will you just stay a little bit longer? I don't want to be alone. Just sit with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
Jennifer nods. Mark leads her into the living room and they sit down far apart from each other on the couch. Mark turns the TV on and they both sit in silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LATER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mark has fallen asleep on the couch. Jennifer checks her watch and stands up. She takes out her wedding invitation and lays it on the coffee table by Mark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She unfolds a blanket and is about to place it on him when she notices an envelope sticking out of his back pocket. She pulls it out and looks at it.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNIFER>
<DIRECTION>
(READING)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My invention.

</JENNIFER>

She opens the letter and begins to read. Once finished, she folds up the letter and hurriedly leaves, scared and confused.

Mark wakes up and sees Jennifer's wedding invitation on the coffee table. He sighs.

INT. MARK'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING

EXT. "CHURCH" - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sign outside reads, "A QUITE PLACE TO THINK ABOUT THE MAN IN THE SKY".
</DIRECTION>
<GREG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Makes sense people would start getting married at these places. I mean, who you marry decides who's mansion you're going to live in one day. It's a big decision.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREG>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>

They enter the building.

A small stage sits before a large stained glass window portraying Mark holding the two halves of the pizza box.

Rob stands at the altar.

<DIRECTION>
Mark and Greg take their seats amidst a crowd of people sitting quietly in their chairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. "CHURCH" - BRIDAL ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jennifer sits in a small room in a beautiful white dress, looking as beautiful as any woman has ever looked. She stares absentmindedly out the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a knock at the door. JENNIFER'S MOTHER pokes her head in.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNIFER_S_MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's time, dear.

INT. "CHURCH" - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"Here's comes the Bride" plays over an organ and Jennifer walks down the aisle towards a smiling Rob.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mark watches her in awe, stunned by her beauty. Rob notices Mark staring at Jennifer and mouths "loser" at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jennifer reaches the altar and stands across from Rob. The WEDDING OVERSEER, an elderly man in a suit, stands between them holding a few sheets of paper in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<WEDDING_OVERSEER>

	We are sitting here in this building today to share in the wedding of Rob and Jennifer.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, hold on one second.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Rob)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rob, can I ask you something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIFER>
<DIRECTION>
There's a slight hubbub in the room. Mark perks up.
</DIRECTION>
<ROB>
<DIRECTION>
(CONCERNED)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. But what are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What color are my eyes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIFER>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I dunno...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(LOOKING)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, they're brown.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON Jennifer's eyes. Indeed, they are brown.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No Rob, they're blue.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIFER>
<DIRECTION>
Rob looks again. Mark stirs in his seat, amazed by what he's hearing.
</DIRECTION>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, look at that. So they are. You've got pretty blue eyes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<DIRECTION>
PUSH IN on Jennifer. It works. Her mind is reeling.
</DIRECTION>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can we get on with this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<WEDDING_OVERSEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jennifer, do you promise to stay with Rob for as long as you want to and to protect your offspring for as long as you can?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEDDING_OVERSEER>
<DIRECTION>
Jennifer is confused. Her mind is fighting it, but she doesn't know what exactly she's fighting. Finally...
</DIRECTION>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIFER>
<DIRECTION>
There is a sigh of relief from the room. Mark shakes his head in sadness.
</DIRECTION>
<WEDDING_OVERSEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Before I pronounce these two man and wife, is there anyone here who thinks they'd offer either of these people a better genetic match-up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEDDING_OVERSEER>
<DIRECTION>
Mark bolts up in his chair.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
The whole room gasps.
</DIRECTION>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh come on. Look at you. You can't be better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes I can. You've got shmuck genes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Schmuck genes? What's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I love her.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Jennifer)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jennifer, don't marry him. Is this what you really want?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause; unsure)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIFER>
<DIRECTION>
Mark thinks this over for a beat.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right. I'm done. Goodbye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
Awkwardly Mark makes his way to the aisle and leaves the room. The room is thick with tension.
</DIRECTION>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are we married yet? Because I've got plans this afternoon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. "CHURCH" - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mark loosens his tie as he walks out of the building and towards the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the background we can see the "church" door open.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNIFER>
<DIRECTION>
(SHOUTING)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold on a minute!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIFER>
<DIRECTION>
Mark turns, confused and tired.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jennifer runs to him. She stands before him, they both stare at each other.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
Jennifer pulls out Mark's letter and shows it to him.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm confused.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIFER>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So am I.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is any of it... the things you said... are they... I can't think of the word.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(PAUSE)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is there a Man in the Sky?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIFER>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why'd you say there was?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIFER>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I couldn't cope with the look on my grandmother's face.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But how could you say something that... wasn't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIFER>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not sure. I just did it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what did you mean that I could grow old and ugly and still be beautiful to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIFER>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean just that. You'll always be beautiful to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But what if my looks...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIFER>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It doesn't matter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I feel funny.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIFER>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me too.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(PAUSE)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everything is so hard. Nothing is easy anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
There is a long moment of silence. Jennifer moves closer to Mark and looks directly into his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know what I want.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIFER>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want short, fat kids with little snub noses.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIFER>
<DIRECTION>
The biggest smile we've ever seen comes across Mark's face.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
<DIRECTION>
(JUBILANTLY)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Easy! That's an easy one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
Just like she did the night on her couch, Jennifer reaches over and puts her hand on Mark's wrist. They both stare at each other for a long beat, holding hands, love beaming from both of them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The world is changing before their eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does anyone else know about your invention?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIFER>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. But I'm sure it won't be long.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Should we tell them right away?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIFER>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not sure. I don't think everyone will understand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
Greg sticks his head out of the church door.
</DIRECTION>
<GREG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's going on out here? Everyone's just sitting in there. Are we gonna finish this wedding?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREG>
<DIRECTION>
Jennifer smiles at Mark.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIFER>
<DIRECTION>
Mark smiles back.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Praise the Man in the Sky.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
WE RISE UP as Mark and Jennifer walk hand in hand towards the church -- and an unknowable future.
</DIRECTION>
<NARRATOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The world's last moment of honesty. A monumental occasion in the history of mankind.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(PAUSE)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That lowly writer who stumbled upon the ability to lie went on to become one of the most important men of his age, married to one of the most beautiful women of his time, and passed on the lying gene to generations to come.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(PAUSE)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A world without honesty is a world with dreams. A world with pretense. A world with fiction. A world with flattery. And most importantly, a world with true love. Put simply, a world very much like our own.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NARRATOR>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO BLACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
