CLOSE ON A MASSIVE STEEL HEAD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Our first thought: DR. DOOM? But it's not moving. A welder's torch sparks into frame in the hands of a sculptor on scaffolding. This is art, an epic 20 foot statue going up of a business mogul (VICTOR VON DOOM) in whose generously extended hands sit two intertwined columns of DNA. His face is chiseled, angular, perfect (too perfect). Past sparks, we MOVE down to pick up...

A large, dark office. Ben in the corner. He yawns, watches...

BRIGHT HOLOGRAMS: Stars. Planets. They hover in the air, making the room feel like a majestic portal into outer space.

Lights brighten, revealing the face behind the voice: VICTOR VON DOOM. 35, handsome, commanding. He looks almost... airbrushed. He drops a WIRED magazine to the desk. REED is on the cover over the words: RICHARDS BANKRUPT, GRANT CUTBACKS.

<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But dreams don't pay the bills, do they?

Reed presses the remote. Another hologram appears: A SHUTTLE slowly approaching AN ORBITING SPACE STATION. Both bear the VON DOOM INDUSTRIES logo. Victor smiles, more intrigued.

	So it's not my money you want. It's my toys... Tell me: if NASA doesn't trust you, why should I?

Victor is a step ahead. Reed pauses, thrown for a beat. Ben wakes up, suspicious. Victor notices. He notices everything.

Sue gracefully walks into the office, only taking her eyes off of Reed to give Ben a warm hug.
</DIRECTION>
<SUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ben, it's been too long.

	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, you made a lot of folks at MIT feel like a junior high science fair. So you'll excuse me if I savor the moment.

Ben tightens. A hard beat. Reed sucks it up.

<REED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You back this mission, and I'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or --

Sue gives a thin smile -- a flicker of old feelings.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twenty-five percent of a billion is enough to keep the lights on, isn't it? Maybe even pay off your fourth mortgage on the Baxter Building.

Ben gets closer, pushing down Reed's computer screen.

<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was a freak of nature. Last I checked, you don't have a crystal ball. Let it go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
Reed considers. But he can't let it go. He opens his computer back up, returning to work. Ben shakes his head, looks out at the view. His eyes catch on something, wheels turning.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>

INT. HELICOPTER/EXT. MOUNTAIN SUMMIT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The chopper hovers over this pristine peak. JOHNNY and his NURSE sit in the chopper-bay, prepping their ski gear. Johnny's customized snowboard has wild, acrylic patterns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His Nurse wears a hot pink cat-suit, her skis dangling out. Their bodies are close: a sexy, competitive flirtation. They look down at a death-defying black diamond run.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNNY>

	Me like-y.

</SEXY_NURSE>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls down her goggles, jumps out. Johnny drops out after her, hitting the snow. He smolders: literally. The snow bank behind him sizzles and starts to melt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes off after her and the chase is on:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BLACK DIAMOND RUN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Nurse knows every inch of the trail, slicing expertly in and out of the trees through deep powder. Johnny's a speed freak, maximizing velocity, closing the gap between them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ghostly FLAMES shoot off his hair: his ski cap catches fire, flies off. Jets of fire knife through the back of his jacket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Nurse looks back: In a burst of speed, Johnny draws even. She looks over and sees the flames shooting out behind him...
</DIRECTION>
<SEXY_NURSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're on fire!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEXY_NURSE>
<JOHNNY>

<SEXY_NURSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No: You're ON FIRE!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEXY_NURSE>
<DIRECTION>
Johnny sees his gloves are burning, flicks them off in alarm. His body SHUDDERS: the back of his ski suit catches on fire. A burst of flame launches him down the slope like a rocket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nurse loses concentration, falls. Johnny races away like a missile, screaming in exhilaration. He looks back -- no nurse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He tries to put out his flaming clothes, and accidentally VEERS to the LEFT. He fails to notice the giant CHASM in front of him. He faces forward and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCREEAAMMS! LAUNCHING off the cliff, LEGS FLAILING, trying to catch ground. FLAMES begin to TRAIL his body as he FALLS towards the rocks below. He tries to will his body away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Instead, his body becomes engulfed in flame. He is a HUMAN TORCH! And for a moment he HOLDS THE AIR -- the fire giving him some kind of...LIFT. He maneuvers just over the rocks, almost making a 90 degree turn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks back at the rocks in disbelief. But the lift doesn't last long. He quickly CRASHES, landing HARD into a snowbank.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He opens his eyes; tries to move but can't. He's trapped under snow and ice. With all his strength, he tries to move, NO DICE. Panic sets in. His eyes go wide as the snow around quickly begins to melt. Johnny is on fire, and within seconds he's sitting in a small POND, steam rising from the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The nurse races toward the steam. Scared, panicked. She finds Johnny...smiling, sitting naked in an impromptu hot tub, staring at his hands. His body. Exhilarated.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Care to join me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNNY>

She smiles and unzips. The FLAMES DISSOLVE TO...CANDLES IN --

	I've got to do something about this scar. Make sure they only shoot my right side.

</VICTOR>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that's a good thing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Victor looks at the scar, enraged by this defect. It glistens in the silver tray. His eyes are bloodshot, sleepless.
</DIRECTION>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, maybe you should get some rest --

Leonard looks at the table, the lavish spread. A beat.

	Sir, I've always wondered... Why Sue? You could have any woman in the world but --
	</DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Great, why don't you join us?

He quickly shepherds the two of them toward a quiet table. Ben's stomach GROWLS; so loud that they all can hear it.

<BEN>

	<DIALOGUE>
	God, I'm starving. Gonna hit the buffet.

Ben's stomach growls again, even louder this time.

INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND DINING HALL - EVENING

The sun is long gone, and so are most of the diners. The room is darker, more romantic. Ben finishes the last shrimp on his plate, pushes it away, belches prodigiously.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>

	Pardon me...

Sue and Reed stare at him. Ben's stomach growls again.

<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I need to lie down. Bad shrimp.

</DIRECTION>
<REED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm really happy for you and Victor.

She slows down, looking at him. She was hoping for more.

As if triggered by her emotion, the fireplace light around her BENDS. The flames flicker in a ghostly breeze.
</DIRECTION>
<REED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? What did I say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REED>
<DIRECTION>
She looks more disappointed than angry.
</DIRECTION>
<SUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's never what you say. It's what you don't say. What you don't do...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUE>
<DIRECTION>
She lets that hang. A lot of history here. Quiet, hurt -- she wants Reed to fight for her, to show some emotion.
</DIRECTION>
<REED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I...I...I just wanted to --
	</DIALOGUE>
</REED>
<DIRECTION>
As Sue's emotions swirl, she slowly...disappears.

<SUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's been two years, and all you can say is you're happy for me and some other guy...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

	You know, Victor may be a lot of things, but at least he's not afraid to fight for what he wants...

(Reed looks down)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And it's nice to be wanted sometimes. To be heard...seen... Reed, look at me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUE>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up...but all that's left of her is the blush on her cheek and her bewitching eyes. He drops his fork, shocked.
</DIRECTION>
<REED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, Sue...? I can't.

</SUE>
<REED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sue...look at your hands.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REED>
<DIRECTION>
She raises her hands, but we don't see them. We only see a medical waistband...floating. Her watch...floating. Her clothes appear to be suspended in mid-air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sue is invisible. She shrieks and gets up -- knocking a GLASS off the table...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SLOW MOTION: The glass flies off the table, tumbling... Reed instinctively reaches for the bottle: his arm stretches two feet out of his sleeve -- grabs it just before it hits --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then snaps back into place. Reed stares at his arm in disbelief. Sue's eyes widen as well. The rest of Sue reappears. They look at each other: mutual alarm.

INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - VICTOR'S OFFICE - EARLY EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLUNK. The candles burn low on the table. Victor strides out, heading for the door. He runs his hand through his hair to comb some strays. A CLUMP comes off in his fingers. He PAUSES. He steps to a mirror, stares at his hair. His SCAR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is longer than the bandage now (as if it SPREAD). Victor peels back the bandage, and sees the scar is bluish-gray. Deep, unhealthy, maybe infected...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

DOUBLE DOORS burst open. Reed, Sue, and Johnny urgently walk.

Reed glances over his shoulder. He stares. Sue follows his gaze to see: Johnny's FINGERTIPS are on fire. He SNAPS his fingers. They GO OUT. He's totally unharmed.

A creepy rippling movement begins beneath the sheet and gradually intensifies, reflected in the fabric's surface: the contours of Ben's body are changing, inflating, growing rough and craggy. SOUND of grinding heavy rocks.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Open up Ben, we need to talk.

It all stops. A beat, then all four legs of the bed give way and it crashes to the floor. Under the covers, he groans in pain, and his voice is DEEPER, GRAVELY, but definitely CLEAR:

INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - BEN'S ROOM - EARLY EVENING

Reed's arm wriggles under the door. It bends upward, swiping clumsily, until it finally grabs the knob. Rubbery fingers find the latch and unlock the door.

Reed focuses, and pulls. His arm snakes out from under the door and snaps back into place. His flesh and bones reforming before their eyes. Johnny stares at Reed.

Their eyes adjust; there's a huge hole where the window used to be. They rush to it. Looking out they see SOMETHING LARGE in the distance, running away.

EXT. TRAIN YARD - NIGHT

A view from Brooklyn: Manhattan glistens in the distance. CAMERA MOVES down to A TRAIN YARD, where we find empty cargo trains. We PUSH IN on the main track, where...
</DIRECTION>

A CARGO TRAIN has just stopped. We hear a cargo DOOR slide open, then WHUMP! Big FEET hit the ground. Someone, or someTHING barrels into the night.

A locked storefront on Flatbush Ave. SOUND of breaking glass.

EXT. PAY PHONE - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
A HUGE FIGURE is huddled in shadow. It's Ben.

CLOSE ON: The dial pad. Big fingers try to push keys but they're too large. Ben tries for a few seconds, getting more and more frustrated. He manages to press "0" with his pinky.

EXT. BROOKLYN HOUSE - NIGHT

Debbie steps out. There is "WELCOME HOME" sign over the door. She looks out. The wind blows softly. Something shifts in the darkness. Debbie pulls her robe tighter.

	Ben?

<BEN>

</BEN>
<DEBBIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Baby, you're scaring me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBBIE>
<DIRECTION>
A hanging beat. And Ben...steps into the light, where we SEE HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME: he's HUGE, easily twice the size he once was, and AN ORANGY ROCKY SURFACE COVERS HIS ENTIRE BODY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Debbie sees him. Fear washes over her, not sure what to think. He reaches out, a little tentative. She flinches back.
</DIRECTION>
<DEBBIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my G-g-g. What did you...do to Ben?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBBIE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Deb, it's me. It's still me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches out. She recoils. It's too much for her. Tears swell in her eyes. Covering her mouth, she backs away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a step closer. She backs away faster, tripping over her robe, falling into the street. A car screeches to a halt. Ben instinctively steps out to help, but she scurries back.
</DIRECTION>
<DEBBIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't...don't...DON'T TOUCH ME!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBBIE>
<DIRECTION>
Her shout wakes NEIGHBORS. Lights flicker on. Ben knows he has to go. He looks at Debbie, sensing this is the last time he'll see her. She trembles, terrified. His eyes go moist.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you, Deb.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
With that, he turns away. The "WELCOME HOME" sign flutters, falls to the ground. A tragic tableau. As more lights go on around him, Ben picks up his pace, speeding into the dawn.

We swoop toward this epic monument. On a steel girder above the road, we see...a STATUE. BEN. He sits on the edge of the beams, staring down at the river below, brooding, muttering.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A few days in space, it'll be great, what's the worst that could happen?

He hears the sound of someone SOBBING. He turns to see...a distraught BUSINESSMAN with a briefcase. The man drops his case, which PLUMMETS hundreds-of-feet into the RIVER.

The Businessman looks out, ready to jump. He doesn't see Ben (or doesn't realize Ben is not a statue).

	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
Backpedaling, the man SLIPS, FALLING toward the ROADWAY! His arms flail, grabbing a narrow beam -- his fingers hold tight while his legs thrash over speeding traffic. Cars and trucks SKIM right underfoot. Ben shakes his head.

<BEN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You had to choose my spot, didn't you?

Ben steps out to help, but...his WEIGHT BENDS the beam! The Businessman LOSES HIS GRIP! He FALLS TO THE ROAD, landing hard on the highway! A few PEDESTRIANS see Ben. They point.
</DIRECTION>

Ben looks up, deer in headlights. He sees a massive TRUCK bearing down on the Businessman.

<DIRECTION>
Ben DROPS to the street. WHOOMPF! He lands in front of the Businessman, SWEEPS him out of the way with one arm, and turns to the oncoming 18 WHEELER CAB.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The DRIVER slams his brakes, eyes wide. The truck SWERVES, but cannot stop! Time slows to syrup, as Ben looks a little scared. He shuts his eyes, and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOULDER-BLOCKS the INCOMING TRUCK! A football move. The truck BUCKLES, POPPING a WHEELIE, CRUMPLING all the way to the windshield! It looks like a metal car-compactor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The truck SWERVES hard, its tail SMASHING into steel girders. CARS SCREECH, SWERVE, SLAMMING INTO EACH OTHER, CAUSING A FOUR-LANE TRAFFIC ACCIDENT! Windows shatter, fires flicker. One of the cars in an NYPD CRUISER. COPS clamber out.
</DIRECTION>

Reed, Johnny, and Sue sit in the back. They see the action on the bridge. Reed and Sue lock eyes, sensing the worst.

EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben stands in the middle of the chaos, staring at the destruction. He sees the tow-truck DRIVER bleeding, trapped in his cab. Ben moves to this burning hunk of steel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He SWIPES through the shattered window, and PUNCHES the airbag, POPPING it like a kid's balloon. He tries to grab the seat-belt, but his fingers are TOO BIG. He struggles.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A little help here?! You wanna hit that button, sir?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
The driver is too woozy. Ben can't get to the button. Frustrated, he simply TEARS OFF THE DOOR, and RIPS THE DRIVER'S SEAT right out of the cab! COPS round the corner. They see Ben holding onto the Driver. They raise their guns.
</DIRECTION>
<COP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	FREEZE! PUT THE MAN AND THE SEAT DOWN!

Ben looks at the cops. PEDESTRIANS stare, point. He realizes how this must look -- a monster holding a bloody man in hand.

At the back of the traffic jam, cars SCREECH to stops. The whole bridge is FULL of bumper-to-bumper traffic. We PUSH TOWARD one car: three doors pop open, and out come...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REED, JOHNNY, SUE. They look through smoke and mayhem to see...their first full look at Ben. Reed stands gutpunched.

<JOHNNY>

	Not even Ben deserves that.

</JOHNNY>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Ben puts the seat down, with the Driver on it. He lunges behind a truck. The cops try to follow, but FLAMES push them back. Ben lurches away, head down, self-conscious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He tries to hide from ONLOOKERS around him and PEDESTRIANS on walkways overhead. He wants to escape, but hears SCREAMING MOTORISTS. He grits his teeth, and moves to help them.

She unbuttons her blouse. Not thrilled with the idea. She wriggles out of her pants. Down to her skivvies. She reaches back to undo her bra...momentarily loses concentration and becomes visible. The sight of Sue in her undies grabs the COPS' attention. Everyone watches, stunned.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The realization that she's visible hits her like a ton of bricks. Cops are transfixed. So is Reed.

	Any more ideas, Reed? Maybe you should strip down next, see how it feels to have fifty people staring --

She stops ranting. Realizes she's gone invisible.

Reed races through wreckage. He tries to see over a big TRUCK, and his neck STREEETCHES!

Ben spins, looking for Sue. He can't see her. But he does see...A CAR INCHES AWAY, WITH GAS TANK FLAMING!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOOOOM! The first car BLOWS! BOOOM!BOOOOM!BOOOOOM! Empty cars BLOW in a chain-reaction. The flames are mushrooming!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reed SWIPES his ARMS OUT, holding people back. His arms FLATTEN to form a barricade -- FACES INDENT his skin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLAMES lash out. A pack of attractive YOUNG WOMEN scream. Johnny LEAPS toward them. His feet LEAVE THE GROUND, giving him extra lift. He SPINS, lands, and embraces the women, SHIELDING them from flames which burn up his back. He looks the ladies up and down, and gives a cheesy smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sue SCREAMS. She puts her hands up (a normal reflex). The air seems to RIPPLE around her hands, like FORCE-FIELDS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at them, surprised, confused. Her invisible fields SPIRAL OUT, partially CONTAINING the blast. But the flames hurtle closer. She fights the pressure. Blood trickles from her nose. Just as the white hot blast is about to hit her...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sue is dressed again. Visible. She SCREAMS, and PUSHES THE FORCE DOWN INTO THE ROAD! She collapses, as the blast deflects off the street and into...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An oncoming FIRETRUCK! BOOOOM! The firetruck is KNOCKED OFF THE GROUND, SLEWING SIDEWAYS. Brakes scream. Its tail slashes out, PUNCHING through the guard-rail.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BACK OF THE TRUCK DANGLES OUT, HUNDREDS OF FEET ABOVE THE WATER! FIREMEN hang off the back and sides. The truck TEETERS, falling! Ben wastes no time. He GRABS onto the front of the truck, just as it goes off the side!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He DIGS his heels into the ground, but his feet DRAG across the concrete, digging grooves into the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE DANGLING FIRETRUCK: FIREMEN climb out, clawing toward the bridge. Their truck SWINGS. Bits and pieces tumble down at them -- a hose, an axe, a helmet. All deadly now. The HANGING LADDER swoops down, with men RIDING ON IT!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben SCREAMS! STRAINING with all his might. Ben SCREAMS! His muscles ripple, and...he takes his first step...back. Another scream. Another step. Another. Another. Epic, painful.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is pulling the truck back onto the bridge, inch by inch. His footsteps THUD. With monumental effort, he levels the truck. Firemen scurry over hoses and ladders, some climbing over Ben.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reed tends to Sue who has fainted from her effort. Ben steps back from the truck and slumps to the street exhausted. Wary cops close in to cover him with weapons, but...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The FIREMEN slowly begin to APPLAUD. The crowd of onlookers joins in as well. Sue, Reed, and Johnny seem surprised, touched by the reaction. But Ben seems uncomfortable.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Firemen step forward to offer Reed a couple of their coats; he hands one to Johnny and uses the other to cover Sue.

Ben sees a familiar face in the masses: DEBBIE. Ben steps toward her, but she stops him with a look. She places something on the ground and runs off into the crowd.

Ben sees something GLISTENING on the ground. He stoops over to pick up...her ENGAGEMENT RING. His big fingers can't grip it. He tries in vain. Hopeless, pathetic. A beat. And...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hand grabs the ring. It's Reed. Quiet, close.

BANKERS sit around a table. LAPTOPS hum. The lead banker is power-broker NED CECIL. The men keep their eyes on Victor.
</DIRECTION>
<NED_CECIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Victor, the bank would like to congratulate you. On the fastest freefall since the Depression. We can't even give your stock away.

Ned motions to the paper, the picture of BEN.

	You promised a cure-all, and came back with this. Who the hell's going to invest in a biotech company that turns its workers into circus freaks?

Victor's grip tightens around the table, and...the LAPTOPS FLICKER, losing feeds.

Victor looks down at his hands -- a private beat (did I do that?) He lets go of the table; screens go back to normal.

Victor considers. His mind races, eyes narrow.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Very simple. I cure them. If I can cure these freaks, then I can cure anyone. What better way to restore my reputation?

REPORTERS snap pictures. A POLICE CONVOY drives up, stopping in front of a towering HIGH-RISE. Sue, Reed, and Johnny and get out of a police-car. Ben steps out of a BIG PADDY-WAGON, which immediately bounces back up to the normal axle position.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COPS hold back the surging press. Ben keeps his head down, self-conscious. He passes Johnny, smiling for the cameras.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Smile, Ben. They want to like you. Give 'em your good side. Or your less bad side.

Ben turns to a group of LITTLE KIDS. Stiff, tentative:

He searches for the name. Sue steps up.

<DIRECTION>
He smiles at Sue, then at Reed.

He opens a drawer full of LETTERS from the BANK. Reed looks sheepish. He shuts the drawer, looks to Johnny and Sue.

The doors close, but...the ELEVATOR does not move. A beat.

<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Either we're moving really fast...or not at all.

</JOHNNY>
<DIRECTION>
A digital readout on the panel: EXCEED MAXIMUM WEIGHT. A sign reads: MAXIMUM CAPACITY: 2000 pounds. They turn to Ben.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll take the stairs.

<DIRECTION>
Doors open. He lumbers out. As the doors close behind him, he looks back over his shoulder, locking eyes with Reed.

The elevator rises. Reed roils with guilt.

<SUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?

<REED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what we're here to find out.

</REED>

Happen to all of them. Reed nods softly.

<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait. You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNNY>

	Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?

Reed considers. But Sue cuts him short with a look.

DING! The elevator stops.

INT. BAXTER BUILDING - ATRIUM - MOMENTS LATER

The elevator opens. They step out. They might be on the 20th floor, but Reed owns the building from here to floor sixty. It's a massive atrium, lit by skylights far above --

Reed leads them into another area filled with separate "apartments" and all the amenities of home.

EXT. BAXTER BUILDING - DAY

The press has died down, but there are still plenty of cameras. A MAYBACH SEDAN rolls up. Victor emerges, wearing sunglasses. This time, the press pay no attention to him. No cameras flash. Victor tightens, and enters the building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SUE'S ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sue walks out of the bathroom in a robe, drying her hair. She notices a familiar book on a shelf: a SCRAPBOOK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She flips through it. It's filled with pictures of Reed and his inventions -- a lot less fancy than Victor's multimedia globe. She stops at a picture of her and Reed in COLLEGE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A noise, and she turns, flinching slightly, surprised to see...VICTOR. He smiles, standing at the door, watching her.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God, I've been so worried about you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
She notices the scar on his head.

<SUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Victor, your scar --

	Please, no apologies. I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos. You'll have round-the clock care.

</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
He goes for her bag. But she stops him. A half beat.
</DIRECTION>
<SUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, that's generous, but I think I should stay here. With my brother. Until we get a handle on this.
	</DIALOGUE>

Victor is not used to being rebuffed. He gives a thin smile.

<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sue. I think you should let my doctors have a look at you.

A tense beat. Standoff. Made more tense by --

	Victor! What are you doing here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REED>
<DIRECTION>
They turn to see Reed approaching, with files in hand.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<REED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not much. We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REED>
<DIRECTION>
Victor pauses. He looks at Sue, knowing she's here to stay.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, let me know if there is anything I can do. We're all in this together now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Victor shakes Reed's hand. His GRIP is so tight that Reed's fingers STRETCH. Victor lets go, and turns to Sue, who puts her hand out. He smiles, and shakes. He heads off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reed looks at his hand. Shakes his wrist. He looks at Victor.

Victor moves fast, holds tight to his anger. Reed catches up.

	Victor wait... I just wanted to say, I'm sorry the mission didn't go as planned --
	</DIALOGUE>
</REED>

Victor suddenly WHEELS on Reed. Lights flicker.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't go as planned? It was a catastrophe. You ruined the lives of four people --

</VICTOR>
<REED>

	I ruined? With all due respect, I told you to abort --

	Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --

Reed sees Victor's SCAR maybe growing. Lights dim.

(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There a problem, Vic?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
They turn to see...BEN down the hall, leaning in a doorway. Victor tightens, looking at Ben's massive rock-hewn body.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No problem, Ben.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
He turns back to Reed. Close, quiet. Lights flicker.

Victor steps away, toward the elevator. He passes Ben, who just smiles and waves "goodbye." Before Victor's finger taps the down-button, the button lights up (as if the circuit responded to him). Reed exhales, shaken. Victor steps into --

The doors close, and Victor really LETS LOOSE. He SLAMS his fist into a STEEL WALL. The wall BUCKLES, steel DENTING.

Victor shakes out his hand, and sees...a rippling METALLIC SHELL under the skin. He stares at it in horror. The dark surface pulsates with electric energy. What is he becoming...?

Ben looks to Sue for translation.

<SUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped.

<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well why didn't you say so? You want me to lift some weights or something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
Reed shakes his head. He approaches with an X-RAY MACHINE.
</DIRECTION>
<REED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, just sit back. We have a good sense of your strength from the firetruck. We need to find the source of your strength.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REED>
<DIRECTION>
He turns on the X-ray machine. The graph shows SOLID ROCK. The rays don't penetrate. Sue and Reed look confused.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How bad is it? You know I used to smoke.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
Reed grabs a BLOOD PRESSURE MACHINE, but the strap is way too short to wrap around Ben's arm. Reed stands stumped. He looks at his tray full of instruments. He picks up the little rubber REFLEX-HAMMER. But it looks miniscule compared to Ben.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reed has an idea. He opens a drawer full of HARDWARE TOOLS. He pulls of a real HAMMER. He approaches Ben.
</DIRECTION>
<REED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, this might smart a little.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REED>
<DIRECTION>
He taps Ben's knee lightly, and BEN'S LEG KICKS! SLAMMING UP! RIGHT BETWEEN REED'S LEGS! The ultimate kick in the crotch. Reed STRETCHES UP a few feet, then SNAPS BACK, wincing.

From their second level control room, Reed and Sue observe Johnny in an enclosed fire-proof chamber. Flames escape through the vents of the chamber...he's fully torched!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reed watches the read-out: it climbs from 2000 to 4000 degrees Kelvin. They are essentially taking his temperature.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE CHAMBER: Johnny turns white hot, blinding to look at: the chamber walls begin to glow red. Machines go haywire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His feet even start to LIFT OFF THE GROUND, LEVITATING a foot or two. He looks down, excited, burning hotter and hotter.

<JOHNNY>

He won't stop. Reed pulls a switch on the wall. FOAM sprays out of nozzles, dousing Johnny's flames. He stands there, covered in thick FOAM. His body steams. So does his temper.

She looks at Reed, eyes narrow. She becomes invisible. As she focuses on Reed -- and gets angry -- a small, clear FORCE FIELD forms around her body. The force-field BENDS LIGHT around a MICROSCOPE, which goes INVISIBLE. Reed steps out to ask...

ANGLES of Reed in the lab, grabbing their space uniforms from various closets/containers:

	Our uniforms were exposed to the storm like us. So they can transform like us, becoming invisible, changing size on demand or remaining impervious to flame.

REVEAL: Reed, Sue, and Johnny step out to look at themselves in a mirror wearing the uniforms. No boots, no gloves. Not yet. (The uniforms will develop, like our heroes).

CLOSE ON: an X-RAY. Victor's ARM. The metallic transformation is higher now. PULL BACK TO REVEAL: Victor and his DOCTOR. In the wall behind them: ancient armor (maybe we noticed it before, maybe not). It adds a little menace to the room.

<DIRECTION>
A SERIES OF TIME-LAPSE SHOTS: REED works around the Baxter Building, spending hours searching for the cure. He checks charts, writes equations, paces, frustrated.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, he sits at his long desk, looking at a wall where Ben's CHARTS are projected (both Ben and Thing's anatomies). Reed wears the uniform under his labcoat. He checks his equations over and over, making notes upon notes.

He hits the end of the slides. The wall fills with white light. Frustrated, Reed SLAMS his head into his desk, CRASH! Something FALLS off the end of the desk.

Reed raises his head, revealing his flattened face. He steps over to see...a PLANT SAMPLE from space, glass box shattered. Red sparks swirl around the plant, like the cosmic storm --

The STORM is a computer-image on screen now. Behind the screen are six chalkboards full of Reed's calculations and the scribbled beginnings of a MACHINE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We PULL BACK to see his arm stretched across the room writing on the end of another chalkboard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's moving fast, excited, almost a little manic. He hears...a CREAK. He slows down, but doesn't look up to see SUE enter.

Sue follows Reed. He flips through a file, excited.

The little car sets the whole shelf off balance. A WAVE OF INVENTIONS COME CLATTERING DOWN! Reed moves fast:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He LUNGES toward Sue, STREETCHING his ARMS AROUND the SHELF, pushing Sue away, just as the INVENTIONS SMASH TO THE GROUND!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reed and Sue hit the floor. A close call. Now more closeness: Sue and Reed lay face-to-face, with Reed's wrapped around her. A heated beat. Their first real intimate moment.
</DIRECTION>
<SUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry. My fault. I won't...touch anything.

As if suddenly made aware of their vulnerability, Sue and Reed stand, backing off. As they part, we see:

BEN watching from the doorway. Melancholy. He disappears. We slowly MOVE TO...A SURVEILLANCE CAMERA in a VENT GRATE.

INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Victor watches a bank of videoscreens. He has the Baxter Building under surveillance. He sees Reed and Sue on monitors. He toys with Sue's diamond ring in his gloved hand.

A door opens. Leonard enters. He sees the screens.

	The only thing he's closer to is Sue...

But Victor sees something between Reed and Sue on the wall. He leans closer, and the camera ZOOMS IN, as if responding to his will. He ZOOMS all the way to a CLOSE UP of:

	Yeah I'm surprised. Surprised the fire department didn't shut this down.

Ben stalks the halls, slipping into his ragged trenchcoat. As he passes a crossroads, he sees a strange sight:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REED'S HAND is TIED to a latch in the wall. His ARM is STREEETCHED THIN, spanning around the corner. Ben just shakes his head, keeps moving. And we FOLLOW REED'S ARM...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UP THE HALL...ROUND A CORNER...DOWN ANOTHER HALL. The muscles and tissue STRETCH, going taut. Finally, we reach...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REED. He steps slowly. He holds a digital TAPE-MEASURE in his other hand, measuring distance. His skin STREEETCHES. His face tightens, pained. We hear the faint SQUEAK of his skin.

	Damn, Stretch!

</JOHNNY>
<DIRECTION>
Reed keeps moving, slowly. His muscles and tendons laboring.
</DIRECTION>
<REED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what I'm trying to calculate. And it's not rubber. It's muscle, tendon. I seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to --

INT. BAXTER BUILDING - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Johnny opens a cupboard, pulls out some JIFFY POP. It starts to POP in his hand, the bag swelling. He casually turns on a TV, flipping to...the X- GAMES. The Jiffy Pop swells, ready to blow. He rips it open, eats popcorn, and watches the games:

Cool stunts, hot girls. Johnny's brow furrows, a thought forming, a mischievous smile on his lips.

A big photo of Ben Grimm in his astronaut heyday occupies a place over the bar. Ben enters, and the bar goes SILENT. He moves through the crowd. People clear out of the way.

Ben reaches the bar. He sits on a stool, and CRUNCH! SMASH! The stool SNAPS like a toothpick. He hits the ground hard. Glasses shake. A few PATRONS smile, laugh softly.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not funny!

They go silent. They drop bills onto tables, filing out, scared of this monster. ERNIE works the bar.

	Hey, that's Ben Grimm there, the first mook from Brooklyn to go to outer space, so pay him some respect!

But the patrons keep filing out. Ben looks down, weary.

<BEN>

	Ernie. Sorry for killing your business. I'll take the usual, then I'm out... Better make it a double.
	</DIALOGUE>

Ernie heads for the booze. Ben gives a sad shake of his head. Then he notices...one lone patron at the end of the bar. A beautiful young woman nursing a drink. Meet ALICIA MASTERS.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who killed the party?

She knocks back her drink, grabs her cane, steps toward Ben.

Ben doesn't say anything. A little unnerved by this woman.

Right as she hits the door, over her shoulder --

	Hey, Ronnie Renner! I'm a big fan.

<DIRECTION>
Ronnie jams down the track, kicking dirt back at Johnny. Johnny now wears a MOTOCROSS OUTFIT over his uniform, with the number "004" on the back and a small 4 over his heart. Ronnie hits the first hill, and CATCHES AIR, FLIPPING HIGH!
</DIRECTION>
<X_GAMES_ANNOUNCER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A rock-solid double-flip!

Ronnie hits the hill, pulls this JAW-DROPPING DEATH-DEFYING STUNT! The crowd is deafening! Ronnie smiles. And...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOHNNY SPEEDS FASTER, FASTER. Trails of FLAME start to streak off his back! He RACES LIKE A ROCKET UP THE HILL! LAUNCHING TO IMPOSSIBLE HEIGHTS! SPINNING LIKE A TOP! A FLAMING BLUR!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And now for the really impressive part: Johnny's bike starts to drop, but JOHNNY KEEPS RISING! He FLAMES ON, spiraling upward! For a few seconds, he's actually...almost...flying.

A beat. Time suspended. And...WHHM! He PLUMMETS back down! LANDS on his bike in mid-air! And sticks a perfect landing, maybe even kicking a little dirt up at Ronnie. Johnny swerves to a stop, with a "holy shit" look on his face. What the hell just happened??

Johnny and the Hot Babe exit, signing autographs for girls in the line. Sue and Reed approach, glare like angry parents.

Ben reels back a FIST the size of an anvil. Stops himself. Instead of attacking, he starts to walk off.

Johnny hurls a FIREBALL that SMACKS Ben in the back of the head. Ben stops. Turns around more shocked than hurt.

Ben charges like a bull, fist cocked back, and...Reed steps in the way! Too late! WHAMM! Ben's fist PUNCHES INTO REED'S CHEST, which INDENTS. Reed's BACK EXPANDS with Ben's fist, PUNCHING into Johnny, launching Johnny off his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BAM! Johnny SLAMS into a moving ADVERTISING TRUCK, with a BURGER KING flame-broiled WHOPPER on the side. WHOOSH! He leaves a flaming imprint on the all-beef patty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd stands stunned. So do Reed and Sue. Cameras pop.
</DIRECTION>

Johnny slowly pulls himself up. The paint on the truck begins to bubble around his hand. Beaten, bruised, he stands. Heating up. Both his hands are now flaming fists of fury.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNNY>

	Let's see if we can get blood from a stone.

He and Ben lock eyes, with a block of sidewalk between them. High Noon. They start to RUN toward each other...

When they are almost within range, Sue STEPS BETWEEN THEM, stops them both in their tracks with just a look. Like a mom:

Johnny nods, totally missing the sarcasm.

INT. INVESTMENT BANK - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

INT. BANK - UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After hours. The floor is slick with water -- puddles in every direction. Ned Cecil comes out of the elevator, heading for his car. As he goes, the structure lights start to flicker. Ned looks up, watches the lights go out one by one, furthest to closest. He looks around. Unnerved by the darkness.

That does it. A surge of electricity courses through Victor. His eyes narrow, and the electricity crackles down his leg to THE GROUND. The electric spark hits the water and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELECTRIC CURRENTS RACE ACROSS THE GROUND, SLITHERING LIGHTNING-FAST ACROSS THE WATER (like deadly electric snakes), heading straight for Ned. His eyes go wide. And...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NED IS ELECTROCUTED! His body spasms. THUD! He slumps, dead. Smoke rises from his body. Victor stands, power swelling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For the first time, his SCAR SPLITS OPEN, revealing a METAL GLOW beneath the skin. He remains scary calm.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>

He leans ever closer, so the static starts to swallow Reed. A hard, deadly beat. Victor's eyes narrow, zooming into...REED'S RESEARCH: SLIDES on the wall. He zooms into key words:

His fist clenches. We hear METALLIC SFX.

<DIRECTION>
INT. BAXTER BUILDING - TRANSFORMATION LAB - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reed enters the room carrying a stack of boxes that no normal man could balance. But he is not normal. His arms are wrapped around the boxes five times over -- like human twine. He stops short, and drops the boxes when he sees...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VICTOR overseeing a group of TECHNICIANS. They are boxing up Reed's work -- all of his equipment, research. Victor wears a bandage, covering his scar. Reed eyes a glint of METAL.
</DIRECTION>
<REED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Victor, are you...are you okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REED>
<DIRECTION>
Victor turns away.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry about me. Worry about yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Reed looks around, seeing his lab turned inside out.
</DIRECTION>
<REED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REED>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What I should have done a long time ago. Applications and patents, Reed. This all belongs to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Reed reaches out, grabbing a folder from a box.
</DIRECTION>
<REED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I'm not done with the machine --
	</DIALOGUE>
</REED>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which is precisely the point. Analysis is over. It's time for action. My men could have mass- produced this by now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Reed shakes his head, defending himself.
</DIRECTION>
<REED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mass-produced? This isn't a toaster. You have no idea how it works.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REED>
<DIRECTION>
Victor pulls the folder from Reed's hand, and whips out the intricate DIAGRAM of the MACHINE. He points to parts:
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Re-create the storm, invert the polarity here, reverse the mutation there. Don't talk to me like I'm some schoolboy. I've got the same Phd you do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Reed is a little surprised that Victor is so familiar with his machine. He points to a SECURE CHAMBER on the blueprint.
</DIRECTION>
<REED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The storm needs to be handled exactly right, or it could make our mutations worse, much worse, maybe even kill us...
	</DIALOGUE>
</REED>
<DIRECTION>
Victor slows. Is Reed getting to him? Or giving him ideas?
</DIRECTION>
<REED>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Victor, please. We need time to verify the data... We can't afford any mistakes -- there's only enough ions for two or three attempts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REED>
<DIRECTION>
Victor considers. He seems to enjoy watching Reed dangle.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Reed. I'm not asking permission.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a final verdict)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll build it, while you check the specs.

Victor walks out. Reed looks unsure, as we CUT TO --

INT. BAXTER BUILDING TRANSFORMATION LAB - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SHIELDS slowly rise. FIVE TECHNICIANS go to work. They wear the VDI jackets. Reed watches, worried.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sue enters. She sees the shields, the technicians, the VDI logo. And she is deeply worried. She steps over to Reed. Sparks fly behind them. Drills scream.
</DIRECTION>
<SUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I talk to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BAXTER BUILDING - REED'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sue steps into the office, followed by Reed. Quiet, urgent:
</DIRECTION>
<SUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUE>
<REED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
	</DIALOGUE>
</REED>
<SUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Better than your life. Victor's not the one who has to get into that thing. We are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUE>
<DIRECTION>
Reed starts to snap, losing his studied cool.
</DIRECTION>
<REED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which is why I'm working twenty hours a day, checking every variable --
	</DIALOGUE>
</REED>
<SUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Every variable but yourself. You don't eat, sleep. You can't live in your head like --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUE>
<REED>
<DIRECTION>
(finally losing it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not the only one in there. I got you, Vic, Ben, Johnny, all rattling around in there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REED>
<DIRECTION>
Sue stands there, shocked by his outburst. A beat.
</DIRECTION>
<SUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So clear it out. Get out of your head. Get out of here...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUE>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at her, knowing what she means. Where she means.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BROOKLYN STREETS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben nearly knocks people over as he stomps down the street, mind tossing and turning. People stare, point. A LITTLE GIRL and FRIEND run up to him.
</DIRECTION>
<LITTLE_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mister, Mister! Please help me! My kitty is stuck in a tree.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LITTLE_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
She gestures to a tree next to Ben. Looks up.

<LITTLE_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please save Miss Lucy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LITTLE_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
Ben rolls his eyes. Looks up. Considers climbing the tree, but thinks better of it. He has another idea...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben grabs the tree with one hand, and starts shaking the crap out of it. MEEEEEEOOOOOOOWWWWRRRRRRR!!!!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cat falls into frame. At the last instant, Ben sticks out his hand and the cat lands safely in his palm. He hands the cat to the girl. Barely acknowledges her profuse thanks. He just moves on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ANOTHER BROOKLYN STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben passes a window in a gallery, and almost misses A LARGE SCULPTURE of his bust.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stops, steps back to take a look. It's exquisitely rendered, capturing not just brute physicality, but the haunting anguish in his eyes. Ben is amazed, and touched, but...
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
<DIRECTION>
(under breath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eyebrows are a little big...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. He stares at these images of himself.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I figured the only way to get you here was to stick that in the window.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
He turns to see...ALICIA in the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How'd you know it was me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<ALICIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm blind, not deaf. Wanna come in?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICIA>
<DIRECTION>
He steps toward her. But he sees...a PARTY in the back part of the gallery. Ben pauses, a little insecure.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not really dressed for a party.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<ALICIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Relax, it's casual.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICIA>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I mean...I'm a little...dusty...

She smiles, a thought forming, as we CUT TO --

<DIRECTION>
INT. GALLERY - STUDIO - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHOOSH! A SCULPTOR'S HOSE sprays a thin stream of water at BEN. Alicia cleans Ben with her hands, using thin CARVING CHISELS for his cracks. Intricate, intimate work.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben enjoys every moment. He eyes a couple, large PUPPETS in the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those yours too?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>

She gets closer, running her hands across his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bennie. You feel pretty good as is.

<DIRECTION>
Ben bristles. He doesn't want to stay this way.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_THING>

	You don't know what it's like out there. Walking around like some kind of circus freak. People staring, whispering --

	I wouldn't know anything about that.

</ALICIA>
<THE_THING>

	Tell me. When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know?

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You went your own way then. You didn't listen to people. So why start now...?

</ALICIA>

As he ponders that, we hear a CROWD SWELLING on the CUT TO --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fans swarm JOHNNY. He signs autographs, poses for pictures. Then his eyes move to...an incredibly long stretch LIMO. A tinted window rolls down. Victor's face emerges.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Need a ride, Johnny?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
EXT./INT. LIMO - NIGHT

Johnny climbs in, sees...three impossibly gorgeous MODELS.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A few fans. Hope you don't mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gotta take care of the fans, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNNY>
<DIRECTION>
He smiles, sitting down in the middle of them.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I built my business knowing what people want. And right now, the people want you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>

Johnny eyes the models, all lusting.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And we don't want to let the people down now, do we?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNNY>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No we don't. Which is why we need to strike while the iron's hot. I'm talking action figures, videogames, sponsors --
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Videogames? You serious?

Victor nods, knowing he has Johnny on the hook.

	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(shaking his head, a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want to break up the band, but you're the one they want. Don't you think it's time to go solo...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Victor subtly nods to the models. They envelop Johnny.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take the car for a spin. Think about it. Is this the life you want? Or would you rather live in Reed's lab...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
The car stops. Victor gets out. He stands on the pavement. As he shuts the door, we see the women climbing onto Johnny. The door shuts, and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHHHMMMPF! The windows all suddenly STEAM UP!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HAYDEN PLANETARIUM - NIGHT

STARS on the ceiling. A VOICE drones about the galaxy. In the LAST ROW, we find: Reed and Sue. Reed is thinking about work.

	I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter's main power to generate enough voltage --

	Of course I was. I'd read all your papers on bioethics. Some of them two times just so I'd have something to say to you.

Reed smiles softly, thinking back.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't want that night to end.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUE>

Reed looks at her. Wrestles with a decision. Then quietly:
</DIRECTION>
<REED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sue, you were right. It wasn't complicated. I just wasn't ready to be...to become...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can be a little intimidating.

<SUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I did. I did, Reed...but I wanted you to be that man.

Someone SHUSHES them. They slump down further. Closer.

<REED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why didn't you say something?
	</DIALOGUE>

Their eyes lock. A heated beat. No more secrets. Their faces are close. A kiss is coming. Closer, closer. Sue disappears.

	That's my nose, genius... These are my lips.

EXT. KIRBY GALLERY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben and Alicia step out together. The crowd quiets, turns. A few whispers flutter. Alicia leans close to Ben, and slips her arm into his. The party goes back to normal.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look around. I'll get us drinks. They always let blind girls cut the line.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICIA>
<DIRECTION>
She walks off. He watches her go. The way her hair moves. The lines of her neck. The light on her skin. This woman is the most beautiful thing Ben has ever seen. He's falling hard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben steps through the crowd. The swanky guests give strained smiles, polite. Ben is starting to feel comfortable here. He keeps his eyes on Alicia, who talks to guests.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben hangs back, happy to watch her. A few patrons pass him, thinking he's just an inanimate statue.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know about this one. It lacks a certain...realism.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRON>
<DIRECTION>
Ben keeps his eyes on Alicia. He overhears two BOHEMIAN GIRLS, who assume he's a statue.
</DIRECTION>
<BOHEMIAN_GIRL_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's always had a thing for runaways and strays, but this is ridiculous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOHEMIAN_GIRL_1>
<BOHEMIAN_GIRL_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. Did she really think these sculptures would sell?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOHEMIAN_GIRL_2>
<BOHEMIAN_GIRL_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like anybody would want this thing in their house. That girl's a one-woman charity.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOHEMIAN_GIRL_1>
<DIRECTION>
Ben just stands there, frozen. His eyes dart around the room, paranoid now. Aware of people staring, laughing. He glances at Alicia, who giggles at something else. Ten seconds ago, this would have been dreamy. Now it's damning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We stay with Alicia, who cuts through the crowd, emerging where she left Ben. She has a PITCHER of wine in hand for him. But Ben is gone. She looks disappointed, hearing his heavy FOOTSTEPS get softer and softer in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THUNDER booms on the CUT TO --

<DIRECTION>
EXT./INT. DINER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A pitstop in Queens. Heavy RAIN swims down windows. BEN sits at the COUNTER, with his hat pulled low, coat tight. Nobody sits within four chairs of him. He sips coffee in a metal bowl. A long beat. Then...

<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	About me? How sweet.

Ben considers. A man deeply alone. A beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DINER - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Victor and Ben sit in a window booth. A waitress sets a foothigh stack of pancakes in front of Ben, removes huge plates he's just cleared. Victor's aware of the other customers in the diner staring at Ben. Ben burps: it rattles the plates.

<THE_THING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Scuse me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_THING>
<VICTOR>

	If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --

	<DIALOGUE>
	Skeptical...?

</THE_THING>
<DIRECTION>
Ben doesn't trust him. But Victor is hitting pressure points.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, he's a brilliant man, we should trust he's working as hard as he can. You're his best friend. So what possible reason could he have for taking his time?

	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, other than getting close to Sue?

INT. BAXTER BUILDING - TRANSFORMATION LAB - NIGHT

Reed and Sue return, laughing quietly, bodies close. Reed turns on the lights, and they flinch when they see...BEN. He sits waiting, scowling. They stop laughing immediately.

<BEN>

	Yeah, I have that effect on people.

</REED>

He POKES his finger into Reed's chest, which INDENTS around it like the Pillsbury Doughboy. Ben pushes Reed back. Hard.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at me, Reed. Look at me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs Reed's face, his fingers INDENTING the skin. He THROWS Reed back. Reed slams down to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<REED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am looking. That's why I can't make a mistake! I've got to get it right, and it's not right yet! We need to test this.

Ben shakes his head, looking down at Reed.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>

	I spent my whole life protecting you, from the schoolyard to the stars. For what? So you could play Twister with your girlfriend while I'm the freak of the week?

Reed tries to stand, but Ben KNOCKS him back. Reed slams into the wall, and stays down this time.

	Stay out of this Susie.

As Ben turns to her, Reed takes this opportunity to WRAP Ben up like a python. They struggle. Ben runs back into a wall to shake Reed. Their faces are close, heated.

Victor gets closer to his screens, watching Reed's every step. This is what Victor has been waiting for. His screens flicker with static -- he's too close, but he can't pull back. He sees: REED TURNS ON THE MACHINE. Hits a countdown. And he grabs his UNIFORM...

Reed SLUMPS TO THE GROUND. His eyes flutter back. Dead...? His body is warped, twisted -- one half remains tense, hard, while the other half is loose, soft, almost melted.

LOUD MUSIC and PULSATING LIGHTS. A young crowd dances and grinds to the beat. Among the colorful lights, STREAKS OF FLAME swirl around the ceiling. We follow them to:

A BALCONY, where we see JOHNNY sitting in a cozy VIP section. He's surrounded by "groupies" climbing over each other to get a look at his various parlour tricks.

He leans closer to a YOUNG WOMAN. Closer. Candles around them start to melt. Beads of sweat drip down her face.

The chamber doors open. Thing enters. He looks around this sterile box. An animal in a cage. Victor pushes a control; the doors of the chamber slowly close and seal. Thing shuts his eyes. He just wants to be Ben again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FROM THE CONTROLS: Victor initiates the transformation sequence. As lights go on inside the chamber, they dim in the lab. Energy pumps into the chamber. The storm swirls faster. Lights flicker...there's not enough power, until --

<DIRECTION>
-- Victor walks over...grabs hold of the machine with both hands...and WHHHM! A countdown begins in the control panels.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SLOW MOVE IN on the chamber, The Thing's face in the window. The chamber activates. The storm strikes hard.

<DIRECTION>
The Thing opens his mouth, a beat, then he screams in agony. Struggling violently inside. To escape? Extend the moment: Condensation obscures the chamber window: The Thing vanishes.

INSIDE THE MACHINE, the RED CLOUD swirls with debris, crackling with light. The chamber rattles dangerously, as the power seems to SHAKE the very foundation of the building.

And then it's over. The light dies down...somewhat. It still pulses along with the chamber. The chamber door SLIDES OPEN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. And...BEN GRIMM steps out. Not The Thing. No more rocks. BEN GRIMM. Naked, tired, but finally A NORMAL MAN.

He slips on his trench-coat -- now way too large. He collapses. He stares at his hands, his arms...it worked.

Reed MELTS down the sides of an AWNING, like a Salvador Dali watch. He tries to GRAB HOLD of window ledges, but he can't get a grip. His ARM streeetches, and SNAP! He falls like a SLINKY, out of control. Half his body loose, half hard.

	</DIALOGUE>
</SUE>

Johnny considers, a half-beat. He looks out. Under breath:
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well then this'll be one hell of a basejump.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNNY>
<DIRECTION>
Sue reaches out to stop him, but Johnny DIVES HEROICALLY OFF THE EDGE! He FLAMES ON! The missile follows his arc. As he drops, his clothes BURN OFF, revealing his UNIFORM.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNNY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (under breath)
</DIRECTION>

	We need to help Reed --

</BEN>

Sue shakes her head, sympathetic.
</DIRECTION>
<SUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ben, you got what we all wanted. You need to stay here. It's too dangerous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUE>

She heads off. Ben watches her go, helpless.

INT. BAXTER BUILDING - REVERSION LAB - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben steps back into this ravaged room. Through the shattered window, he sees Johnny's FLAMES streaking away. A hard beat.

	What...what have I done?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NEW YORK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Johnny zigs and zags, but the missile takes every twist and turn, gaining on him, bearing down. Cars slow, stop. More people look up, scared, pointing at this stunning sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VON DOOM CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eerily silent. Reed tries to move, but he is FROZEN. He hears a footstep. But the room is EMPTY. No sign of Doom even. A beat. He hears a CREAK. Another CREAK, closer. And...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FREEZING TUBE starts to SHIFT. It goes taut, clearly being manipulated by a hand -- an INVISIBLE HAND. Sue APPEARS next to Reed, tube in hand. She tries to stay calm.
</DIRECTION>
<SUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What has he done to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUE>
<DIRECTION>
Reed's eyes shift to see...Doom emerge from the darkness.

</DOOM>

He steps closer. Electrodes course over his metal skin.
</DIRECTION>
<SUE>

	We know the machine works. It worked on Ben, it'll work on you. We can turn you back --

<DOOM>

	Do you really think fate turned us into gods so we could refuse these gifts?

</DOOM>

She hardens, a little force field starts to emanate from her.
</DIRECTION>
<SUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Victor. You always thought you were god.

<DIRECTION>
Doom has a hand behind his back, generating an energy blast.

</DOOM>
<SUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Victor... Let's.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUE>
<DIRECTION>
She HURLS a force-field at him. It CONNECTS, KNOCKING him back a half-step. But he simply shakes it off, and steps up. Too powerful. He smiles. His arms CRACKLE with electricity.
</DIRECTION>
<DOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Susan...... You're fired.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOOM>
<DIRECTION>
BOOM! He FIRES an ELECTRIC SHOCKWAVE that LAUNCHES her back. She spirals through the air, crashing into the wall, THUDDING to the floor. As Doom stalks closer, Sue gathers her strength to...GO INVISIBLE.

	</DIALOGUE>
</DOOM>
<DIRECTION>
He SPINS, GRABS her! Doom grips her neck, SLAMMING her to the ground beside Reed. She lays there, beaten, visible.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the distance behind Doom, city lights BLINK, fading in and out. Lights flutter softly here (like when Ben went through the machine). Reed looks up. Could it be...?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. EAST RIVER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Johnny jets over the water with the missile only twenty feet behind him. He's running out of options, when he spots:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A GARBAGE BARGE floating in the water ahead. Thinking fast, Johnny does a fly-by and HURLS a fireball at the barge. VWOOSH! The flames ignite and spread quickly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He loops back toward the flaming barge as the missile closes in on him. Fifteen feet...ten... Just as it's about to hit --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOHNNY FLAMES OFF and falls toward the water. As he tumbles through the air, we CUT BACK TO --

<DIRECTION>
INT. VON DOOM CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From their vantage point, they see the missile explode. Flames dance. Sue's eyes darken, as Doom grips her neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reed tries desperately to move, but he is FROZEN. It takes every last ounce of strength to lift one finger, which makes a CRACCCKKKKING sound.
</DIRECTION>
<DOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One more down. Now it's just the scientist and his specimen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOOM>
<DIRECTION>
Sue and Reed lock eyes. Reed tries to move his mouth. He has something to tell her, struggling just to move his lips and get the words out.
</DIRECTION>
<REED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sue. The only thing I ever knew without thinking was...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

He starts to say "you," but his lips FREEZE, mid-word. Sue whispers to him:
</DIRECTION>
<SUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me too, Reed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUE>
<DIRECTION>
Doom steps toward Sue, about to deliver the final blow.

<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	IT'S CLOBBERING TIME!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
Doom turns, just as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BAM! Ben HITS Doom harder than any living thing has ever been hit. The force sends Doom back through the air, toward the far wall, where he SMASHES into the massive "V" sculpture. It SNAPS, crashing onto him. A few sparks. Then nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing at all. No more movement. Doom is dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben turns to Reed.

<BEN>

	Victor's "not that bad," huh? Just "a little larger than life"? Maybe you'll listen to me next time before --

</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
WHMM! The WRECKAGE shifts. They turn to see...Doom EMERGES. He stands, power coursing. And he CHARGES at Ben! Ben charges back. And these two behemoths...
</DIRECTION>

SLAM INTO EACH OTHER, CRASHING THROUGH GLASS, INTO THIN AIR!!

UNDERWATER: Doom and Ben LAND HARD. Their combined weight CRACKS the floor of the pool. A YOUNG BOY watches underwater through his MASK. Doom and Ben square off, but...

The CRACKS OPEN WIDER! And they're PULLED toward the HOLE! WHOOSH! The water is all sucked out of the hole. The boy holds tight to a ladder, as Ben and Doom crash down to --

CRASH! Water floods the street. Doom and Ben land in a large GARBAGE TRUCK. The truck rocks back and forth, DENTING from the inside. Grunts, growls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CRASH! The truck suddenly STOPS. COP CARS SPEED CLOSER, sirens screaming. And --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOOM, A HUGE SHAPE explodes from the truck. SMASH! Ben lands on a CAR filled with two OLD LADIES -- his head cracks the WINDSHIELD. Doom steps out of the garbage truck, water flooding the street around him. COP CARS converge on Doom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Doom turns his attention to the cops. His limbs SPARK with electricity, ready to fire at the cars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT./INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>

Ben sees the cops and Doom. He knows the cops are dead meat. He turns to the OLD LADY in the driver's seat.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>

	Excuse me, Maam. Can I borrow your car?

<DIRECTION>
EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOOM! Doom SMASHES into the OUT OF SERVICE BUS! CRASH! Windows shatter. The bus SLAMS into an ELECTRICITY POLE, snapping the pole. Doom steps out, unharmed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben CHARGES toward him. Doom grabs the broken ELECTRICITY POLE, FLIPS it into his hand, and wields the pole like a giant STUN-GUN! Electric sparks FLY through the air into --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEN! The BLAST of VOLTS launches him off his feet! He goes FLYING backward, ELECTROCUTED in mid-flight, and --

<DIRECTION>
WHOOMPF! Ben LANDS HARD, face down, CRATERING the street! Water rushes into the crater. Ben lays there, incapacitated.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the street, cars SCREAM to stops, people GASP. Doom strides up to Ben, and raises the ELECTRICITY POLE for the death-blow. Currents surge. Right before he swings down --

Doom turns to these three wounded soldiers.

WHOOOSH! Johnny SWOOPS DOWN, hurling a FIREBALL like a flamethrower, KNOCKING Doom back.

Johnny takes his place alongside the others. The four of them stand as one. Johnny turns to Thing.

Thing starts to retort, but Johnny gives a warm smile.

They turn to Doom, who stands with metal skin slightly singed and melted, making him look all the more menacing.
</DIRECTION>
<DOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is going to be fun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOOM>
<DIRECTION>
Electricity starts to course through his body. He stands at the foot of the crater Ben made. He THRUSTS down, grabbing a thick POWER CABLE, RIPPING it out of the street!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He SNAPS the cable into two snaking, lashing strips. He holds tight, ABSORBING the power. Lights FLICKER and DIM in buildings around him. Windows BLOW! Doom GLOWS, amped up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He LETS GO of the cables! The two deadly wires SNAKE out of control! PEDESTRIANS scatter, panic. Reed sees the wires SLASHING through the air. He makes a move:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reed STREEETCHES HIS ARMS, reaching for the deadly cables.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Doom FIRES superpowered ENERGY BOLTS. The electric charges surge through the air toward the Fantastic Four, but --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sue TOSSES her FORCE-FIELDS, exploding Doom's blasts in mid- flight. She keeps her hands up, BLOCKING blows like a prize fighter. One of Doom's BOLTS glances off her force-field and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SMASHES into a concrete stanchion of a BUILDING! The pillar starts to crumble, with PEOPLE huddled under the overhang! They're about to be CRUSHED by the falling concrete! But --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the concrete roof HOLDS STEADY...because...BEN is holding it up! He stands beside the stanchion, like Atlas holding the world. People run out, safe.
</DIRECTION>

ON THE STREET: Reed finally grabs both ends of the wire.
</DIRECTION>
<REED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	JOHNNY! SPOT-WELD!

<DIRECTION>
Johnny FLIES toward him, and uses his flames to WELD the wires back together. Sparks fly. The cables start to FUSE.

Doom keeps FIRING. Sue struggles with her force-fields. The impact is too much. Her nose starts to bleed.
</DIRECTION>
<SUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't...hold...on...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUE>
<DIRECTION>
Doom smiles. Reed sees her. She is about to drop her hands, vulnerable, but..............REED STRETCHES HIS WHOLE BODY!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He EXPANDS himself across the street, and GRABS a TREE, so he forms a WALL between Sue and Doom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Doom keeps FIRING his bolts. They SLAM into Reed's body, RUBBERBAND his skin, and DISTEND OUT his back without breaking. He strains, agonizing.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Flame on, kid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THING>
<DIRECTION>
FLASH! Johnny explodes in a PULSE of BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT, which starts to HEAT UP everything surrounding it. Reed doesn't miss a beat. He's in total command now.
</DIRECTION>
<REED>

	Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --

	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sure I can come up with something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUE>
<DIRECTION>
She concentrates. She sees Johnny holding onto Doom -- and the GROWING HEAT and LIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sue shuts her eyes. A GIANT FORCE FIELD EXPLODES FROM HER BODY. A massive WAVE OF ENERGY. It SWOOPS past a car, which WARPS, MELTS (half the car is not inside the force-field).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thing turns to the crowd, extending his arm, blocking them. Sue's force-field ENVELOPS JOHNNY'S SUPERNOVA, containing it in a BRIGHT SPHERE OF ENERGY. The light increases, to the point that it's blinding. People look away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, Johnny's supernova fades. He collapses to the ground, exhausted, smoking. Sue exhales and falls to her knees. Her force field fades. The light flickers out. As everyone's eyes adjust, we hear...THUD. THUD. And --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DOOM steps through the smoke. Unharmed. His metallic body GLOWS WHITE, TRAILING MOLTEN METAL. Sue, Ben, Johnny look devastated. They can't beat him. He looks at Reed.
</DIRECTION>
<DOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that the best you can do...? A little heat...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOOM>

Reed stays perfectly calm. He shakes his head.

<BEN>

	Got it, teach.

</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
He KICKS OPEN the FIRE HYDRANT. The water GEYSERS UP! Ben kicks down with his foot, deflecting the water so it sprays toward Reed, who...TWISTS HIS TORSO so...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The water CURLS around his chest, RACES down his arms, and SHOOTS right off his wrists toward Doom!
</DIRECTION>
<DOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOOM>
<DIRECTION>
Doom RUSHES TOWARD Reed, but the WATER FLIES OUT, DOUSING DOOM. GIANT CLOUDS OF STEAM fill the air from the cooling metal. DOOM screams. His shrieks finally fade to SILENCE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The water stops, thick steam clouds roll, completely obscuring Doom from view. A beat. The steam clears to reveal:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DOOM. A true statue now -- a hard, cold solid piece of METAL. Frozen forever. Reed, Sue, Ben, and Johnny -- The Fantastic Four -- exhale. They stand as one, in roiling smoke. A beat.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn, I love this job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNNY>

Reed and Sue slowly lock eyes, thinking the same thing.

Will they accept their mantle? Reed shrugs.
</DIRECTION>
<REED>

	Well, we do have the suits...

They give weary smiles. A team. Sue gets close to Reed.

	You know, about what we said up there, I think maybe --

</SUE>
<DIRECTION>
THHM! He KISSES HER. His neck extending. Strong, powerful. He pulls back slightly, smiles at her. A new strength in him.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
Sue looks at Reed. A long way from that conference room.
</DIRECTION>
<SUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hilarious.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
As they kiss, people emerge, stepping out of hiding. The sun rises around them. The Fantastic Four step into the new dawn of a new day. And we slowly DISSOLVE TO --

	<DIALOGUE>
	Reed. What are you doing?

Reed drops to his knees. His head stays eye-level, while his body drops. Sue gapes, so emotional she starts to DISAPPEAR.
