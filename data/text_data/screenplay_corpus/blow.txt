<DIRECTION>
CLOSER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We realize the dots are people. Workers swinging long steel machetes in slow methodical rhythm. WHOOSH. WHOOSH. WE SEE the South American Indian MEN clearly now. Their tar stained teeth. Their gaunt faces riddled with crow's feet. Their jaws chewing away on huge wads of coca leaves as they collect the harvest.

The bundles are undone and Columbian women separate out the leaves. Tribes of underweight workers carry armload after armload of the harvest and ritualistically dump them into a gigantic cannibal pot which sits on top of a raging bonfire.

</JUDGE>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In all honesty, I don't feel like what I've done is a crime and I think it's illogical and irresponsible for you to sentence me to prison. None of the real criminals of the world ever end up behind bars. I mean, when you think about it, what did I really do? Cross an imaginary line with a bunch of plants? You say that I'm an outlaw, you say that I'm a thief, but where's the Christmas dinner for the people on relief?

George stops when his attorney stamps on his foot. The court officers roll their eyes and the judge smiles.

The sound of a young man, a MALETON, struggling can be heard in the distance. From another area, PABLO ESCOBAR emerges. He is singular in purpose. He is handed a pistol and moves quickly over to the man and quietly speaks a few words. And then, without emotion, he shoots the maleton in the head. George and Diego, who is visibly shaken, watch. Escobar is handed a towel, and he wipes the splattered blood off his hands, as he moves back.

The rules are the same. No English. No raising voices. No sudden movements. George offers their leader, TONY, beers for his men, and is politely declined. The count starts. George and Diego riff through ten thousand dollar bundles. Diego is still acting pissy. He's mumbling to himself, making faces, slamming the money all around. The guys keep a close eye on him.
