EXT. FOREST - JUST BEFORE DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mail-clad HORSEMEN gallop headlong through the dark, bent low over their saddles. A bestial scream is heard, and suddenly a saddle is empty, the rider sprawled face down in a pool of blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the head of the band, COLWYN, a boy of twenty-two, raises his shield to ward off an unseen assailant. We hear a horrendous tearing sound, and Colwyn's father, TUROLD, riding beside him, looks over at the boy. Colwyn is unharmed - but his shield is deeply gouged, as if by a huge claw.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARAPET OF WHITE CASTLE - DAWN

A GUARD sees the band of warriors emerge from the forest.

EXT. APPROACH TO WHITE CASTLE - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The warriors gallop toward the main gate of the castle. Though their arms and armor are reminiscent of the Middle Ages on Earth, this is not Earth ...
</DIRECTION>

TWIN SUNRISE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind the riders, TWO SUNS rise above the horizon.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. MAIN GATE OF WHITE CASTLE - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Turold and Colwyn lead their men through the gate and dismount. Waiting for them are LORD ROWAN, a man of Turold's age, and an elderly COUNCILOR. Rowan notices the gouges in Colwyn's shield.
</DIRECTION>
<ROWAN>

(to Turold)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were attacked in the forest?

<DIRECTION>
Turold and Rowan walk down the corridor, followed by Colwyn and the Councilor.
</DIRECTION>
<ROWAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I tried to reach Ynyr, the old one. I led a hundred men to his place in Granite Needle, but it was surrounded. The Dark Ones guard it by night and by day they call out the Slayers. Ynyr cannot get out and no one can get in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROWAN>
<TUROLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How many did you lose?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TUROLD>
<ROWAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sixty at the needle, another thirty in the forest. Only ten of us made it back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROWAN>
<TUROLD>

	We will have to try again. His knowledge is great. Without it, we cannot hope to win.

INT. QUEEN'S BEDROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The QUEEN is propped up in bed, eyes closed, head tilted back. Her crown, a jeweled tiara, rests in her lap. She is attended by two GIRLS-IN-WAITING, one of whom sponges her forehead with a damp cloth. The Queen opens her eyes as the elderly Councilor enters.
</DIRECTION>
<COUNCILOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lord Turold and his son, my lady.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COUNCILOR>
<DIRECTION>
The Queen hands her tiara to one of the girls-in-waiting, who places it on her head. Then she nods, and the Councilor admits Turold and Colwyn, followed by Rowan. The three kneel.
</DIRECTION>
<QUEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He has turned out well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUEEN>
<DIRECTION>
Turold stands and looks down at Colwyn with an affectionate smile.
</DIRECTION>
<TUROLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Middling well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TUROLD>
<DIRECTION>
Colwyn stands and we see that he is several inches taller than his father.
</DIRECTION>
<TUROLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Though a touch too tall for my taste.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TUROLD>
<DIRECTION>
Colwyn smiles somewhat sheepishly.

</QUEEN>
<TUROLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Barak is still strong in the north, and Tendo holds the high passes. But the great desert forts have fallen.

</TUROLD>
<QUEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Freylag's stronghold?

</QUEEN>
<TUROLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It has been taken, Freylag and all his people slaughtered.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TUROLD>
<QUEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is only a few weeks and already half our strong places have fallen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUEEN>
<TUROLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The attacks are unceasing: by night, the Dark Ones; by day, those of our people who have sold themselves to them, those traitors who are called the Slayers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TUROLD>
<QUEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is the way of all invaders. Those they would conquer they divide, buying allies with promises of land and power.

</QUEEN>
<TUROLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We will hold. Their power is not unlimited.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TUROLD>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GLOOMY FOREST ROAD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two mounted SLAYERS ride along the road. Their horses and armor are black, as are their cylindrical, flat-topped helmets, pierced with a T-slot for vision. Their weapons are long-swords and maces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two more Slayers ride out of the forest and join the black column. At a road up ahead wait three more, who swing in behind the column as it passes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Forest noises die at the Slayers' approach; the only sounds we hear are the clink of metal and the heavy thud of the horses' hooves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TOWER STAIRCASE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Colwyn mounts a narrow, circular staircase toward a wooden door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TOWER ROOM - INTERCUT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LYSSA, the Queen's seventeen-year-old daughter, stares across the circular room at the wooden door, listening to Colwyn's approaching footsteps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door swings open and Colwyn enters. They stare at each other for several moments: Colwyn, dusty and disheveled in his armor, Lyssa freshly scrubbed and glowing in a diaphanous gown.
</DIRECTION>
<COLWYN>
<DIRECTION>
(nervous)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm Colwyn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLWYN>
<DIRECTION>
Lyssa nods, noncommittal. They start to circle the room, eyes fixed on each other, like a pair of nervous cats.
</DIRECTION>
<COLWYN>
<DIRECTION>
(plaintive)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you Lyssa?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLWYN>
<DIRECTION>
She gives him another noncommittal nod. They resume their tentative circling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, Lyssa turns away, leaning on the sill of a narrow window. Her shoulders begin to heave, as if she's sobbing. Colwyn is in agony; he rushes across the room to her.
</DIRECTION>
<COLWYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't care what arrangements were made by our parents. You don't have to go through with it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLWYN>
<DIRECTION>
Lyssa continues to heave.
</DIRECTION>
<COLWYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They can't force you. I won't let them!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLWYN>
<DIRECTION>
Lyssa turns around, and Colwyn sees that she's not sobbing, but laughing.
</DIRECTION>
<LYSSA>
<DIRECTION>
(trying to control her laughter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYSSA>
<COLWYN>
<DIRECTION>
(taking considerable umbrage)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't have to go through with it either.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLWYN>
<LYSSA>
<DIRECTION>
(still laughing, touches his arm)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't understand. I'm just so relieved. I was sure you'd turn out to be short and fat and gimpy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYSSA>
<COLWYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. That.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(begins to chuckle)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know what you mean.

(sits down beside him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYSSA>
<COLWYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Last night was the worst. I dreamt you had one leg shorter than the other, and walked like a penguin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLWYN>
<LYSSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mine was worse: I dreamt you picked your nose in public.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYSSA>
<COLWYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's worse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLWYN>
<LYSSA>

</LYSSA>
<COLWYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you're beautiful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLWYN>
<LYSSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You might be handsome. I can't tell through all that grime. Besides, you reek of sweat and horses.

She goes over to a small cistern and fills a wooden bucket.
</DIRECTION>
<LYSSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take off your clothes. I'm going to scrub you down.

<COLWYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're not married yet.

</COLWYN>
<LYSSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, then you can go up to the parapet and I'll hand the buckets up to you.

Colwyn looks at the stone stairs leading to the top of the tower.

<COLWYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do I have to?

<DIRECTION>
(looks at Lyssa, sighs)

	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLWYN>
<DIRECTION>
He starts up the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROAD CROSSING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A column of mounted Slayers waits at the crossing for another column to reach the intersection. The first column falls in beside the second as it passes, forming a double column.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Farther down the road waits LORD MODRED, a Slayer like the others, but distinguished by the leopard embroidered on his chest and by his lance, which bears a pennon affixed to its head: ermine, a leopard courant sable. As the double column reaches him, he wheels and leads them down the road, lance upright.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. QUEEN'S BEDROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Turold and Rowan at the Queen's bedside.
</DIRECTION>
<QUEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lord Rowan is one of Lyssa's godfathers. He will defend her in the ceremony. I wish that Lord Modred were here. He is a godfather of her own blood.

</TUROLD>
<QUEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For some, the lure of power is stronger than the ties of blood. No matter. I had hoped to have the wedding next spring, Lord Turold, with all the nobles of the kingdom in attendance. But Fate and this war have ordained otherwise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUEEN>
<TUROLD>

	It is important to assure the succession.

</QUEEN>
<DIRECTION>
The Queen smiles and beckons Turold closer. He kneels beside the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<QUEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will tell you something you did not know, Turold. Had it been my choice, all those years ago, I would have chosen you for my king. But my parents chose otherwise.

</QUEEN>
<TUROLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I knew.

P.O.V. - NORTH TOWER - INTERCUT

Angle from the Queen's bedroom window. A waist-high wall conceals the bottom half of a naked Colwyn, who stands atop the tower, hugging himself in the brisk wind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TOP OF NORTH TOWER - INTERCUT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Colwyn hears Lyssa mounting the stairs and moves to the doorway, reaching around to take the bucket from her.
</DIRECTION>
<COLWYN>
<DIRECTION>
(as Lyssa pushes past him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just hand me the bucket! What are you doing!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLWYN>
<DIRECTION>
He backs away, covering himself with his hands. Lyssa advances on him; tucked in her belt, like a sword, is a long-handled bath brush.
</DIRECTION>
<LYSSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't trust you to wash behind your ears.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYSSA>
<COLWYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never mind my ears! Go away!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLWYN>
<DIRECTION>
The Queen and Turold watch the unfolding drama from their window vantage point: a great tongue of water leaps across the tower as Lyssa heaves the bucketful at Colwyn. Dripping wet, he retreats, but is soon cornered and attacked without quarter, Lyssa wielding brush and soap with gleeful enthusiasm. At one point, Colwyn squirms free and, with his head completely enveloped in lather, tries to flee. But since he can't see, he soon fetches up against a wall, and Lyssa continues her scrubbing.

Wrapped in a long blue cape, a scrubbed and scowling Colwyn stands with arms folded across his chest. Lyssa is combing his hair.
</DIRECTION>
<LYSSA>
<DIRECTION>
(steps back)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There. Now you look like someone I might want to marry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYSSA>
<COLWYN>

	Maybe you'd better look around for another candidate. I don't think my skin is tough enough to survive a lifetime of you and your brush.

</COLWYN>
<LYSSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't have to look around. I've found the husband I want. You can kiss me now.

<COLWYN>

	Thank you, but I can wait.

She bestows a class-A smack.
</DIRECTION>
<COLWYN>

	I lied.

<LYSSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	About what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYSSA>
<COLWYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't wait either.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLWYN>
<DIRECTION>
They close in a passionate kiss, and begin caressing each other. We see Turold standing in the doorway, watching them.
</DIRECTION>
<TUROLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll both wait. At least for five hours. The wedding is at three.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TUROLD>
<COLWYN>
<DIRECTION>
(acting offended)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was a platonic kiss, Father.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLWYN>
<TUROLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course it was.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TUROLD>
<DIRECTION>
Turold snorts down a laugh. Colwyn and Lyssa begin to giggle. Then all three break into laughter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COURTYARD OF WHITE CASTLE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The occupants of the castle - servants, soldiers, minor nobles, and retainers - stand in two parallel lines, forming an aisle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Turold and Rowan, on horseback, face each other at opposite ends of the aisle. Midway between them stand Colwyn and Lyssa, side by side, Colwyn facing Rowan, Lyssa facing Turold. The two fathers are not armored, but they hold longswords balanced across their pommels.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Colwyn glances up toward the Queen's balcony.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. QUEEN'S BALCONY - INTERCUT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Queen lies on a couch, attended by her two girls-in- waiting. She answers Colwyn's look with a nod.
</DIRECTION>
<COLWYN>
<DIRECTION>
(shouts to Rowan)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am Colwyn, son of Turold, of the eagle's blood, and I am come to take your daughter from you.

<TUROLD>
<DIRECTION>
(shouts)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You shall not!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TUROLD>
<DIRECTION>
The two men spur their horses toward the wedding couple, who stand perfectly still as the horses thunder down on them. Turold and Rowan swing their swords directly above the heads of the young couple, the blades striking with a clang. Then they wheel their horses to a stop. Colwyn and Lyssa, almost obscured by the whirling dust, have not moved a muscle.
</DIRECTION>
<TUROLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let it be done then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TUROLD>
<DIRECTION>
He hurls his sword at the ground beside the wedding couple.
</DIRECTION>
<ROWAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is done.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROWAN>
<DIRECTION>
He hurls his sword, which sticks in the ground beside Turold's, crossing it. A cheer goes up from the spectators and the guards on the walls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Colwyn and Lyssa kiss, a crossbow bolt strikes one of the guards, who topples thirty feet to the courtyard below. Slayers appear around the walls, leaping over the parapet and attacking the guards.
</DIRECTION>
<TUROLD>
<DIRECTION>
(shouts)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Slayers! To arms!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TUROLD>
<DIRECTION>
Men and women arm themselves as Slayers descend the walls. They mount a fierce counterattack against the Slayers, women fighting beside their men, Lyssa fighting beside Colwyn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But suddenly the main gate is rammed open and a dozen Slayers on horseback, led by Modred, attack the defenders from the rear. In the melee, Colwynn and Lyssa are separated.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. QUEEN'S BALCONY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Queen and her girls hear Slayers forcing the door to her bedroom within.
</DIRECTION>
<QUEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help me up. I will die on my feet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUEEN>
<DIRECTION>
The two girls help the Queen to stand. She faces the door defiantly as it bursts open. A Slayer steps into the bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<QUEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I will not die alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUEEN>
<DIRECTION>
She hurls a knife, which pierces the Slayer's throat. But even as he falls, three more Slayers enter the room and advance on the three women, who stare back defiantly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COURTYARD OF WHITE CASTLE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Colwyn sees that his father is being pressed by several Slayers and hacks his way to his side. They dispatch their assailants, then Colwyn looks through the courtyard for Lyssa, who has just run a Slayer through with her short sword, when she is felled from behind by Modred's mailed fist. He picks her up and lays her across his saddle.
</DIRECTION>
<COLWYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They have Lyssa!

They go through the door, and are followed shortly by two Slayers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CORRIDOR IN WALL OF WHITE CASTLE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Colwyn and Turold back down the dark corridor, fighting the two Slayers. They kill the Slayers but, in the exchange, Turold is badly wounded. He leans against the wall, holding himself erect by force of will.
</DIRECTION>
<TUROLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The passage. Open it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TUROLD>

Colwyn pressed one of the rough-hewn stones and a door swings open in the wall: A staircase leads to an underground passage. He moves to help his father through the door.

	You have no chance alone, boy. You must try to break through to Ynyr. He has great knowledge. Only with his help can you save Lyssa.

They hear footsteps in the corridor.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go! I command you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TUROLD>
<DIRECTION>
As Colwyn enters the passage and begins swinging the heavy door shut, Modred appears, advancing on Turold with drawn sword. Turold places himself in front of the door, but he is weak from his wound and goes down under Modred's first blow. Modred thrusts his sword into the crack of the door, preventing it from closing. Turold, slumped against the wall, looks up at him with pleading eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<TUROLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Spare him, Modred. Have you never loved anyone?

Modred stares at him for some moments, then withdraws his sword, allowing the door to close. Turold flashes a look of gratitude, then dies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COURTYARD OF WHITE CASTLE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The castle is in flames, the occupants slain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Slayers, mounted, wait in a double column for Modred's command. Lyssa sits on a horse in the middle of the column, her hands tied behind her. Modred approaches her with a skin canteen of water, which she refuses by averting her face. He steps back and signals the column, which trots out through the main gate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Modred mounts his horse to follow the column, the twin suns dip below the horizon. Modred rides through the main gate, disappearing in the shadows. We hear an inhuman scream, amplified by the stone walls of the gate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Modred's riderless horse emerges from the other side of the gate. A new angle shows Modred lying on the stone floor beneath the gate tower, his chest raked by deep gouges.

EXT. WOODS NEAR WHITE CASTLE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Colwyn stands beside the exit of the underground passage, tears running down his cheeks as he stares at the burning castle in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FOREST NEAR GRANITE NEEDLE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The forest ends abruptly, some distance from the edge of a steep cliff. A natural stone bridge arches from the cliff to the Granite Needle, a cylindrical formation that rises from the floor of the valley below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Colwyn stands at the edge of the forest, looking out at a group of Slayers posted near the stone bridge. Nearby are a pair of black tents housing more Slayers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He hears a noise and turns to see a Slayer behind him, drawing his sword. As the Slayer rushes, Colwyn hurls his knife at the T-slot in the Slayer's cylindrical helmet, striking him between the eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GRANITE NEEDLE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Colwyn, wearing the dead Slayer's helmet and armor, approaches the group near the stone bridge. The bridge leads to an opening in the side of the Needle, which gives access to a passage which extends some ten feet into the Needle before it takes a right-angle turn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the floor of the passage are heaped the bodies of half a dozen Slayers; though Ynyr may not be able to get out, he is clearly capable of preventing anyone from getting in.
</DIRECTION>
<COLWYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The old man must sleep sometime.

<SLAYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, sometime. But when?

</SLAYER>
<COLWYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps now.

<SLAYER>
	<DIALOGUE>

	... along with them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</2ND_SLAYER>
<DIRECTION>
The Slayers laugh, but fall silent as Colwyn draws his sword and starts across the bridge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He moves across the bridge into the passageway, stepping over bodies as he nears the right-angle turn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAVE IN GRANITE NEEDLE - INTERCUT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ynyr stares down the passage toward the right-angle turn. In his hand, held out before him, is a silver glaive, a cross- shaped weapon with four equal blades.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When Colwyn rounds the corner into view, the glaive leaps from the old man's hand and spins down the passageway.
</DIRECTION>
<COLWYN>
<DIRECTION>
(pulling off his helmet)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am Colwyn, son of Turold!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLWYN>
<DIRECTION>
The glaive stops in midair, inches from Colwyn's throat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Realizing they've been tricked, two Slayers start across the bridge to attack Colwyn. But the old man projects his glaive past the boy, where it hangs in midair, spinning and glowing. The Slayers retreat.
</DIRECTION>
<SLAYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is no way out. He will die there with the old man.

	</DIALOGUE>
</YNYR>
<DIRECTION>
Colwyn glances toward the entrance.
</DIRECTION>
<YNYR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is night. The Slayers have gone to their tents and the bridge is guarded by Dark Ones. They will not cross, for they have no power in this place.

Colwyn follows Ynyr through a passageway to ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRIANGULAR ROOM IN GRANITE NEEDLE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Colwyn and Ynyr sit beside a fire in a triangular pit in the floor. Colwyn has shed the Slayer's armor, and Ynyr holds a black onyx box in his lap.
</DIRECTION>
<YNYR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is not the first time the Dark Ones have attacked our world. They came once before, a thousand years ago. A young king and queen, with extraordinary powers, were given to us then, to lead the struggle. My fore-father was their Councilor, as I will be yours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YNYR>
<COLWYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have no extraordinary powers.

</YNYR>
<COLWYN>

	In the old books. It's called a glaive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLWYN>
<DIRECTION>
Ynyr opens the onyx box to reveal a golden glaive.
</DIRECTION>
<YNYR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This belonged to the young king who fought the Dark Ones a thousand years ago. Now it is yours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YNYR>
<DIRECTION>
Colwyn picks up the glaive, turns it in his hands, the blades flashing in the firelight.
</DIRECTION>
<YNYR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With two or three days' practice, you'll be able to use it as well as I can. Then we'll have a chance of fighting our way out of here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YNYR>
<COLWYN>
	<DIALOGUE>

EXT. BOTTOM OF GRANITE NEEDLE - INTERCUT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Colwyn reaches the ground and signals Ynyr, who unties the rope from the glaive and secures it around his waist. Then he lowers the rope over the glaive, which allows Colwyn to lower him down the side of the Needle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NEARBY CLIFF - INTERCUT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Dark One watches them from the top of the cliff, its red eyes peering over the edge. The thing moves quickly down the rock face, with only an occasional scrape or flash of claw to mark its descent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the bottom of the cliff, the red eyes appear above a rock - only a few yards from Colwyn. But before it can attack, a trident flashes through the air and strikes the thing square in the face, the outer prongs of the weapon piercing the red eyes. We hear a death grunt, then the sound of a body falling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Colwyn turns, but sees nothing. He lowers Ynyr to the ground and they set off across the valley floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FOREST CLEARING - JUST BEFORE DAWN
</DIRECTION>

The golden glaive stands upright on Colwyn's outstretched palm. Ynyr kneels beside him.

<YNYR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Focus on the glaive.

Colwyn tenses with concentration. The glaive begins to spin, at first slowly, then faster and faster until it's a golden blur.
</DIRECTION>
<YNYR>

	Reach out with your mind. Reach out to Lyssa.

Colwyn furrows his brow in concentration.

A LONG SHOT SHOWS only a series of jagged peaks, but as we MOVE IN, we SEE the outlines of a gigantic fortress, designed to blend into the mountains.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lyssa walks along the parapets of the fortress, a cold wind whipping at her light garments. The occasional glint of talon or beak, the quick flash of a red eye, tell us that she is closely watched and guarded.

But Colwyn continues to concentrate.

Ynyr slaps him sharply, knocking him backward. The boy lies exhausted, breathing heavily.

</YNYR>
<COLWYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She was in a great fortress, first in the mountains, then in the jungle. How is that possible?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLWYN>
<YNYR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is the Fortress of Krull. I know it only from the stories of wars on other worlds. They did not use it on our world in the first great war, for it costs them enormous power. This time they mean to conquer, at all costs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YNYR>
<COLWYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Fortress moves?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLWYN>
<YNYR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Each dawn it rises in a different land: sometimes in the mountains, sometimes in the jungle, sometimes the desert, sometimes the sea. Never in the same place twice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YNYR>
<COLWYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then even if Lyssa tells us where she is, we'll never be able to reach her, for they will never allow the Fortress to rise near us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLWYN>
<YNYR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. They occupy the Fortress, but they cannot control its movement. It is moved by Fate. And, sooner or later, Fate will place it near us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YNYR>
<COLWYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then we must be ready. Five leagues from here is the Eastern Tower. I know the Barons who hold it. Good men, and brave. They will help us.

EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - INTERCUT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A fawn grazes in the clearing, unaware of a white leopard poised on a branch above it. As the leopard is about to pounce, it glances up and sees Lyssa staring down from the Fortress wall. As if in answer to her summons, it jumps to the ground and heads for the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The leopard leaps onto the walkway in front of Lyssa, then moves obediently to her side. They set off down the walkway together.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the leopard whirls and roars as it hears the scrape of a taloned foot behind. But other Dark Ones are in front of them. Lyssa is forced to descend a stone staircase. The leopard, acting as rear guard, roars its defiance as it backs down the stairs.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. FOREST BROOK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Colwyn and Ynyr are about to cross the tiny stream, when suddenly a small white cloud materializes above the water, bulging and gyrating, affording brief glimpses of feet and hands, as if a small man were trying to escape. As Colwyn jumps back, drawing his sword, the cloud vanishes with a POP and the small man, ERGO, is plopped on his seat in the water (which is only a few inches deep).

<ERGO>

	Blast! A thousand miles off course. Well, I was rushed. There was a certain difference of opinion concerning a venison pie. The foolish man left it sitting on his windowsill. What did he expect?

	Perhaps he expected to eat it.

	For that rudeness, peasant lout, I am going to leave you hanging by your heels when I depart. Which is right now.

</ERGO>
<DIRECTION>>From the folds of his voluminous clothing, Ergo produces a tattered spellbook. He peers at a page, mumbles to himself, and pokes his head toward Colwyn - whereupon he vanishes. Colwyn glances around but the little man is nowhere to be seen.

We follow Ergo as he sets off down the forest path, heading in the opposite direction from Colwyn and Ynyr. After a few yards, the forest seems to grow darker, the sounds more ominous. Ergo glances around apprehensively. Suddenly, through an opening in the leaves, he sees a face with a single eye in the middle of it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a yelp, he turns and races back up the path after Colwyn and Ynyr. When he catches up, he wedges himself between them to get as much protection as possible.

As Colwyn, Ynyr, and Ergo cross the clearing, Ergo steps on a snare-trigger and is suddenly hoisted into the air by his foot. Colwyn draws his sword and turns to face five armed men who step out of the forest. They're a rag-tag bunch, garbed in various kinds of chain-mail and armed with a bizarre variety of weapons.

Torquil plunks the handle of his long battle-axe into the ground, then folds his hands across the top of the blade and rests his chin on his hands. He stares hard at Colwyn, who returns his gaze calmly.
</DIRECTION>
<TORQUIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And where do you lead, boy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TORQUIL>
<COLWYN>

BARDOLPH, OSWIN, and RUHN nod their agreement. The sixth robber, SWEYN, back away.

<SWEYN>

	I follow the man who follows gold. He who follows glory travels without me.

</SWEYN>
<TORQUIL>

	Go then, and let greed be your gravestone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TORQUIL>
<DIRECTION>
Sweyn moves off into the forest. An angry oink causes the others to look up at the snare, which holds a small pig by its foot; as usual, Ergo's magic has boomeranged.
</DIRECTION>
<TORQUIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What have we here?

<DIRECTION>
(prods the pig with his axe)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Roast pork for dinner.

The pig squeals his objections. Torquil signals to drop the snare, and picks the pig up under his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<COLWYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He needs his book.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLWYN>
<DIRECTION>
Torquil finds the open spellbook and kneels, allowing the pig to read it. Pop, and Torquil is holding a gyrating cloud under his arm, replete with squeals and yells and pieces of pig and Ergo; pop, and the cloud disappears, leaving Ergo under Torquil's arm.

As the band nears the crest of the hill, Colwyn stumbles. Torquil reaches out to steady him.

They top the hill and look out over the valley, dotted with plumes of smoke from burning villages.

<TORQUIL>

	They burn many villages. Even walled cities fall to them.

</TORQUIL>
<COLWYN>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do they burn the villages? There's nothing to gain.
	</DIALOGUE>

<YNYR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's terror to gain. Their wealth is fear: they get it with fire, they spend it to rule.

EXT. FOREST CLEARING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The band has stopped in the middle of the clearing. Colwyn is swaying, barely able to stand.
</DIRECTION>
<TORQUIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll stop here to hunt. Even those who don't sleep must eat.
	</DIALOGUE>

Colwyn folds his arms across his chest, tries to stand up straight.

(eyes almost closed, swaying)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLWYN>
<DIRECTION>
Torquil purses his lips and blows at Colwyn, who falls backward into the arms of Kegan, who lays him gently on the ground, fast asleep. Torquil covers him with his cape. The other robbers string their bows and prepare to hunt.
</DIRECTION>
<ERGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bring me a deer! No deer, no supper.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERGO>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FOREST CLEARING - AN HOUR LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Torquil and Ynyr talk to several PEASANTS at the edge of the clearing while, in the center, Ergo tends the cooking fire, beside which Colwyn lies asleep. Ergo's face lights up when he sees Kegan arrive with a stag across his shoulders, and he snick-snacks his carving knife in anticipation. But Torquil has Kegan turn over the stag to the peasants, which nearly gives Ergo apoplexy.
</DIRECTION>
<ERGO>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I must take the old man to see some sick children. Kegan will guard you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TORQUIL>
<DIRECTION>
But Kegan spots a hare and creeps into the forest after it, leaving Ergo and Colwyn alone in the clearing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, Ergo hears ominous noises. He peers into the dark forest and his jaw drops as he sees a pair of red eyes staring out of the gloom. He snatches up a carving knife and a frying pan and backs toward Colwyn, holding the pan as a shield. The red-eyed thing moves toward them through the trees, and poor Ergo is unmanned by fear: he drops his knife and ducks his head behind the frying pan in sheer terror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But he hears the thing stop short and raises his head to look behind him, where a CYCLOPS stands with trident poised to throw. The little man assumes that both creatures are trying to kill him and faints dead away. But the trident is aimed at the red-eyed thing, which has no desire to do battle with the Cyclops. The thing retreats, the red eyes fade. The Cyclops comes over to Ergo and kneels to listen to his heart. Then he enters the forest after the Dark One.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FOREST CLEARING - LATER THAT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The band, including Colwyn, is gathered around Ergo, who is telling his story.
</DIRECTION>
<ERGO>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One with red eyes, the other with one eye, both trying to kill me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERGO>
<YNYR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The one with red eyes was a Dark One, the other was a Cyclops, and it was not you he meant to kill.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YNYR>
<ERGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was aiming a huge spear right at me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERGO>
<YNYR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If that were so, you'd be dead now. He was aiming at the Dark One, for there is ancient hatred between them. Once his race had two eyes, like other men, until his forefathers bargained with the Dark Ones: they gave up one of their eyes in return for the power to see the future. But they were cheated, for the only future they were permitted to see was the time of their own death.

	I wish you'd tell me why that foolish boy decided to join up with these thieves.

The little man suddenly lets out a yelp and jumps back: He is staring into the jaws of a huge shark frozen in the wave (as was all the marine life in the lake, including gulls with one foot touching the water). He steers around the jaws and catches up to Ynyr.

The little man pulls out a carving knife and, with a flourish, tucks it in his belt - slicing through his outer garment as he does so. Colwyn glances down and sees red liquid oozing from the cut. Ergo follows his gaze.

EXT. EMERALD STONEHENGE - LATE AFTERNOON

<DIRECTION>
A circle of stone dolmens, emerald green, in the center of which sits an old man, blind, wearing a green robe: an EMERALD SEER. Sitting across from him is TITCH, his ten- year-old assistant, similarly robed.

A green-hued holographic image appears above the emerald, showing Colwyn and his band approaching. The Seer weaves his fingers through the image, reading it by touch.

As the twin suns dip below the horizon, the flames spurting from the Seer's fingertips begin to leap and lengthen, until the sphere is surrounded by fire, its color changing from emerald-green to crimson. We hear faint, hollow screams of rage.

The holograph above the sphere begins to waver and blur, then is shattered by a holographic black claw shooting upward from the sphere. The talons of the claw are blood red, its appearance accompanied by a hollow scream.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Colwn leads the Changeling down the path, we see the hand on his shoulder turn into a claw. The claw is moving toward his neck when suddenly the Cyclops bursts from the trees in front of them. Colwyn stares in disbelief as the Cyclops hurls his trident straight at him. The weapon whistles past his ear and slices off the Changeling's arm at the shoulder.
</DIRECTION>

Colwyn spins, sees the red eyes, ducks backward as the Changeling swipes at him with his other hand - now become a claw. He draws his glaive as the Changeling reverts entirely to bestial form, its hideous black body bursting the seams of the emerald-green robe.

As the creature springs at Colwyn, we see, for an instant, the horrible face: teeth flashing, eyes burning. Then Colwyn's glaive strikes between the eyes. Slit by the horizontal blades of the glaive, the eyes explode in a burst of red and the thing dies with a scream.

EXT. SWAMP OF BETRAYAL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A mangrove swamp, with a lattice-work of gnarled roots hovering above dark waters. The band enters the swamp.

	</DIALOGUE>
</YNYR>
<DIRECTION>
Colwyn and Torquil help the old man, Ynyr, while the Cyclops takes care of the two little ones, Ergo and Titch, sometimes lifting one in each hand to deposit them on the next root.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Slayers reach the edge of the Swamp and dismount. Sweyn and the Chief Slayer lead them in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The band is halfway across the Swamp when Colwyn suddenly slips and plunges into the water.

But the waters of betrayal have begun their work:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLWYN'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sees Torquil stand and embrace Lyssa, who comes from behind a tree.
</DIRECTION>
<TORQUIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let him drown.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TORQUIL>
<LYSSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Then we'll marry and you will be my king.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYSSA>
<DIRECTION>
They kiss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Colwyn draws his sword and swings at Torquil.
</DIRECTION>
<COLWYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Traitor! She'll marry you in hell!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLWYN>
<YNYR>
<DIRECTION>
(to Torquil)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He thinks you betray him with Lyssa.

<DIRECTION>
(to Colwyn)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Colwyn! The waters deceive you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</YNYR>
<DIRECTION>
COLWYN'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sees Ynyr stand and talk to someone behind the tree.
</DIRECTION>
<YNYR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have delivered him into your hands. Now pay me the price we agreed on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YNYR>
<DIRECTION>
A black claw appears, pouring gold coins into Ynyr's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Colwyn lunges at Ynyr.
</DIRECTION>
<COLWYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will melt that gold and pour it down your throat, old man!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLWYN>
<YNYR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He sees betrayal everywhere. He will attack us so long as he is conscious.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YNYR>
<DIRECTION>
They glance anxiously at the Slayers, closing quickly. Titch reaches into Ergo's voluminous coat and pulls out a soup ladle, which he throws at Colwyn. The ladle catches Colwyn in the forehead, knocking him unconscious - but also knocking him backward in the water, out of reach.
</DIRECTION>
<ERGO>
<DIRECTION>
(to Torquil)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your axe! Lay it out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERGO>
<DIRECTION>
Torquil tucks the heel of the axe handle under a root and grips it with both hands. Ergo tightropes out the handle and kneels on the axe head, directly above Colwyn.
</DIRECTION>
<TORQUIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't hold the weight of both of you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TORQUIL>
<ERGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hush!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERGO>
<DIRECTION>
He squinches his eyes shut and mumbles something to himself. The gyrating white cloud appears with a pop and, when it pops off, Ergo has been transformed into a snake, with its tail wrapped around the axe handle. The snakes plunges into the water and wraps itself around Colwyn's chest. Torquil grits his teeth and pulls up on the axe, lifting the snake and Colwyn out of the water and depositing them on a nexus of roots.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The white cloud reappears and returns Ergo to human form, barely conscious, coughing and spitting water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile, the Slayers are almost upon them. The Cyclops has moved to the rear with Kegan, Oswin, and Rhu. As the Chief Slayer comes within range, the Cyclops lunges with his trident, slicing the root on which the Slayer stands and spilling him into the dark waters. Sweyn kneels to help him out.
</DIRECTION>
<CHIEF_SLAYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Traitor!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHIEF_SLAYER>
<DIRECTION>
He stabs Sweyn in the chest, slicing through the purse of gold coins. Sweyn tumbles into the water, blood and gold pouring out of the gash in his jacket. The Chief Slayer attacks the others, wounding some, knocking several into the water - and they, in turn, attack their fellows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The band stares in awed silence as the Slayers massacre each other. The din of battle fades; the Slayers, dead to a man, float in the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Colwyn regains consciousness, the others gather round.
</DIRECTION>
<COLWYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forgive me, my friends. I saw terrible things.
	</DIALOGUE>

The band emerges from the Swamp, which laps at the foot of the Widow's Mountain. Ynyr faces Colwyn and Torquil.

He turns and starts up the mountain.

At the rear of the group, the Cyclops heads toward a forest, carrying Titch on his shoulder.

INT. INN - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Kegan, Oswin, and Rhun are downing flagons of sack and dandling pretty INN-GIRLS on their knees. Torquil eyes them enviously from the fireplace across the room, but can't bring himself to leave Colwyn, who takes no comfort from wine or women.

Ergo, sitting near Colwyn, stares despondently into the fire.

EXT. WIDOW'S MOUNTAIN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ynyr climbs toward the hourglass opening of the Widow's cave above, lit by an eerie light from within.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WIDOW'S CAVE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A gigantic web of crystal stretches across a vast, domed cavern, shimmering in the luminescence from below. At the center of the web is a domed cubicle, made of criss-crossed ribbons of mirror glass. Light flashes off the mirrors in such a way that it is impossible to see, through the openings, who or what is within.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The blinding effect does not occur inside the cubicle, so that a POV SHOT from inside shows the entire web clearly. It also shows, reflected from hundreds of facets on the inside of the structure, the face of the WIDOW, the old woman who sits at the center: a hideous crone, grotesque and distorted. She sees Ynyr standing at the edge of the web.
</DIRECTION>
<WIDOW>
<DIRECTION>
(low)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Someone comes here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WIDOW>
<DIRECTION>
She picks up an hourglass, containing only a handful of sand, and turns it to start the sand running out.
</DIRECTION>
<WIDOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is his time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WIDOW>
<DIRECTION>
Ynyr is shouting at her from the edge of the web.
</DIRECTION>
<YNYR>
<DIRECTION>
(shouting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am Ynyr. I seek the Widow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YNYR>
<DIRECTION>
But sound does not pierce the cubicle. From inside it, one can only see his lips moving.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ynyr steps onto the web and starts toward the center. When he's halfway across, he turns to see a giant black widow spider made of crystal, entirely translucent except for a red hourglass in the center of its crystal abdomen. As the spider approaches Ynyr and prepares to attack, the red color expands, filling the abdomen first, then spreading through the rest of the body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ynyr holds up his glaive. The spider stops, begins moving sideways; the redness fades. Inside the cubicle, the hourglass sand has almost run out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The spider twitches a crystal strand, throwing Ynyr off balance and causing the glaive to fly from his hand. It sticks in a crystal strand, too far to reach. Ynyr is helpless. The spider advances, reddening.
</DIRECTION>
<YNYR>
<DIRECTION>
(desperate shout)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lyssa!
	</DIALOGUE>
</YNYR>
<DIRECTION>
This name has the power to pierce the soundproof cubicle: the Widow stands as she hears the name, ECHOED by the huge cavern.
</DIRECTION>
<WIDOW>
<DIRECTION>
(calls)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who speaks that name!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WIDOW>
<YNYR>
<DIRECTION>
(shouts)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ynyr!
	</DIALOGUE>
</YNYR>
<DIRECTION>
She watches as the spider looms over Ynyr. Then she reaches behind her and turns the hourglass, just as the last grains of sand run out. This causes the spider to back away, turning translucent again. Ynyr retrieves the glaive and makes his way to the domed cubicle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He enters the cubicle to find the Widow facing away from him, though he can see her hideous face reflected back by the mirrors in front of her.
</DIRECTION>
<WIDOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is fifty years since I heard that name.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WIDOW>
<YNYR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is fifty years since I spoke it to you.

</YNYR>
<WIDOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was beautiful then.

</WIDOW>
<YNYR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The most beautiful woman in the world.

</YNYR>
<WIDOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you would not stay with me.

</WIDOW>
<YNYR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could not. Could not betray the girl to whom I was betrothed.

<WIDOW>

<YNYR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We had no children.

<WIDOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You had a son.

</WIDOW>
<YNYR>
<DIRECTION>
(staggered)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You said nothing. You told me nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YNYR>
<WIDOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You had left me! I kept silent out of rage.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WIDOW>
<YNYR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is he? My son.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YNYR>
<WIDOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I killed him when he was born.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This place is my punishment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WIDOW>
<DIRECTION>
The old man bends his head sadly. When he looks up, he sees in the mirrors that tears are coursing down the Widow's cheek. As he watches the tears, the mirrored face turns to that of a beautiful young girl. And the Widow is stunned to find that she sees the reflections as he sees them: the face of a young girl.
</DIRECTION>
<WIDOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do not try your trickery on me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WIDOW>
<YNYR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is no trickery.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YNYR>
<WIDOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those are reflections.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turns to face him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is my face!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WIDOW>
<DIRECTION>
When she starts to turn, we SEE her as old. But when she faces Ynyr, we SEE her THROUGH HIS EYES: as a young girl.
</DIRECTION>
<YNYR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YNYR>
<WIDOW>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WIDOW>
<DIRECTION>
A REVERSE ANGLE explains her smile: she sees him as the young man who loved her.
</DIRECTION>
<YNYR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Memory is no trick, it is a power. The power to see.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YNYR>
<WIDOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Power you have given me. What can my power give you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WIDOW>
<YNYR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Knowledge.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YNYR>
<WIDOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WIDOW>
<YNYR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Fortress of Krull. When will it come near here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YNYR>
<WIDOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why must you know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WIDOW>
<YNYR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is a girl there. Her name is Lyssa.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YNYR>
<WIDOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You lie!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WIDOW>
<YNYR>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.

</WIDOW>
<YNYR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A young man seeks her. A young man about the age I was when I met you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YNYR>
<WIDOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tomorrow, the Fortress of Krull will rise with the sun in the Valley of Reeds. But the knowledge is of no use to you. No man has ever escaped the Web. And soon the creature will come for you, even here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WIDOW>
<DIRECTION>
Ynyr touches his glaive.
</DIRECTION>
<WIDOW>
<DIRECTION>
(shakes her head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It will not help.

</WIDOW>
<YNYR>

	Then the other Lyssa will share your fate. She will grow old in the Fortress as you have grown old here.

The Widow takes a small gold hourglass from a mirrored niche.
</DIRECTION>
<WIDOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold out your hand.

</WIDOW>
<DIRECTION>
She breaks the hourglass and pours the sand into his open hand.
</DIRECTION>
<WIDOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those are the sands of my life. So long as they remain in your hand, the creature cannot harm you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WIDOW>
<DIRECTION>
Ynyr closes his hand, but the sand trickles out through his fingers. He tries clenching it tightly, but the sand continues to run.
</DIRECTION>
<YNYR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I cannot stop the sand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YNYR>
<WIDOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You cannot stop time. Go now, before it runs out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WIDOW>
<YNYR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You will come with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YNYR>
<WIDOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is sand enough for only one life. Go now, save the other.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WIDOW>
<DIRECTION>
She watches Ynyr make his way across the web toward the cave entrance. The ANGLE is BEHIND HER, and we SEE her hands grow gnarled and mottled, her body become that of an old woman once again - but when we SWING AROUND IN FRONT OF HER, we SEE that her face is still that of a young girl.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crystal spider scuttles across the web to attack Ynyr. But the old man holds up his clenched fist and shows the sand running from his fingers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stymied, the spider crouches and turns blood red. A scream of rage fills the cave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ynyr reaches the safety of the entrance and looks back: the blood-red spider scuttles to the center of the web and smashes open the cubicle. Ynyr looks at his hand: the sand has run out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the old man makes his way sadly down the mountain ...
</DIRECTION>

Shows her encased in a web shroud; and though her body is old, she retains, even in death, the face of a young girl.

INT. INN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Torquil and his men dandle INN GIRLS on their knees, laughing, leching, and guzzling. The INNKEEPER bustles about, assisted by a much-abused serving girl named VEELA, whose beauty is concealed by kerchiefed hair, frumpy clothes, and a layer of soot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across the room, Colwyn and Ergo sit in front of the fire, staring gloomily into the flames.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Titch comes in the back door and whispers to Torquil, who signals his men. They get up and head for the back wall, where Cyclops is swinging open a pair of large double doors.

Ergo is too glum to notice the sudden diminution of noise, but Colwyn sees Torquil and his men carrying in a giant venison pie, ten feet across and five feet high.

Ergo's head pops up through the crust.

<ERGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here lies Lord Ergo, drowned in a venison pie. He died with a smile and a belch, goodbye, goodbye ...

</ERGO>

He disappears inside the pie again. The others crowd around and begin dismembering it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. INN - LATER THAT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Colwyn and the Cyclops stand guard over sleeping robbers and inn girls. Ergo floats half-awake in the gravy in the pie shell, a contented smile on his face. He opens his mouth and allows a piece of venison to float into it. Then he hears whimpering and peers over the edge of the crust: Titch is asleep nearby, in the throws of a nightmare.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The serving girl, Vella, is still busy cleaning up. As she passes the pie shell, she hears scrabbling and splashing, and stops to see a puppy trying to clamber out.
</DIRECTION>
<CYCLOPS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lift him out.

Vella lifts out the puppy and sets it on the floor. The puppy shakes itself, then trots over to Titch. The boy hugs the puppy to his chest.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Her working day is over. She'll rest now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLWYN>
<DIRECTION>
The Innkeeper scowls, then skulks off, grumbling. Colwyn helps the girl up and sees that her ankle has been twisted by her fall. He puts an arm around her and helps her toward the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CENTER OF VORTEX
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lyssa moves around the walkway, looking for escape, but all the passages leading out of the Center are blocked by red eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE_OF_THE_BEAST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you considered?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE_OF_THE_BEAST>
<DIRECTION>
She turns to see the gigantic red eyes in the Beast's hole.
</DIRECTION>
<LYSSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do not want your power. It is hideous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYSSA>
<VOICE_OF_THE_BEAST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know nothing of power, you foolish girl. You think power is a mighty sword, or a strong castle, or the paltry magic of an Emerald Seer. Power is none of these.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE_OF_THE_BEAST>
<DIRECTION>
The red eyes in the hole disappear. Lyssa hears the voice behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE_OF_THE_BEAST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Power is beauty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE_OF_THE_BEAST>
<DIRECTION>
She turns to see a Greek Adonis standing behind her. His naked body glistens with oil; he is incredibly handsome. (But his eyes are red.) She retreats. The Adonis vanishes and Lyssa feels her hand clasped gently. She turns to see a girl of her own age, smiling at her. (But her eyes are red and she speaks with the Voice of Darkness.)
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE_OF_THE_BEAST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Power is friendship.

<VOICE_OF_THE_BEAST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Power is joy.

</VOICE_OF_THE_BEAST>
<DIRECTION>
Lyssa sees herself (but with red eyes) as a young mother, holding a baby and laughing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then she feels a hand on her cheek and turns to see Colwyn (red-eyes), smiling at her as he caresses her cheek. He speaks with the dark Voice.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE_OF_THE_BEAST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Power is desire.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE_OF_THE_BEAST>
<DIRECTION>
She knows, from the eyes and voice, that this is not the real Colwyn. But loneliness and fear and longing are beginning to take their toll. She touches his hand, presses it against her cheek.

INT. VELLA'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vella sits dejectedly on the edge of the bed. Colwyn stands near.
</DIRECTION>
<VELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was betrothed to a boy from my village. We were to be married this summer, but he traveled across the sea and his ship was lost.

	They say he drowned, but I know he is alive. I know he will come back to me.

<COLWYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLWYN>
<DIRECTION>
Vella stands and slips the kerchief from around her hair, which is long and lustrous. It tumbles loose, falling gracefully around her shoulders. She wipes the sleeve across her face and, almost magically, the smudges and dirt disappear. She steps out of her ungainly shoes, then unfastens her ugly dress; it falls to her feet. She stands barefoot in her chemise, stunningly beautiful.
</DIRECTION>
<VELLA>

<VOICE_OF_THE_BEAST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These are the galaxies you will rule.

</VOICE_OF_THE_BEAST>
<DIRECTION>
Through the crack, we see galaxies moving toward us, slowly at first, then faster. We see not only the familiar galactic forms - spirals, ellipses, spheres - but shapes and colors never seen from Earth: exploding galaxies of red stars, whirling galaxies of yellow and blue, galaxies writhing as if in pain. They move toward us, faster and faster, until they becomes blurs of light and color. Another wall cracks open.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE_OF_THE_BEAST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These are the worlds of your empire.

<VOICE_OF_THE_BEAST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These are the beings who will be your slaves.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE_OF_THE_BEAST>

We see crowds of living creatures, some humanoid, others with shapes never seen, prostrating themselves in obeisance, keening their pain and fear.

Vella's left hand turns into a claw. She moves it toward his neck, then stops. She begins to cry; blood-red tears run down her cheeks.

<VELLA>

	My master told me: make him betray her; if he will not, kill him.

Colwyn plucks his glaive from his belt and poises it to throw.

The red-eyed Colwyn extends his left hand, which turns into a claw; the talons clutch the empty air - and in her room, Vella gasps as she is strangled.

The red-eyed Colwyn snaps his arm sideways - and Vella is flung across her room against the wall. Her body disintegrates, leaving only gray ash and an empty chemise.

The fire-mares charge past the Cyclops, who disappears in a cloud of smoke and steam and spray. They wheel and charge again, circling him. He fixes his eyes on the lead mare, who pulls out of the circle and comes toward him. The Cyclops places his hand on the mare's muzzle and the horse stands quietly. The others follow suit, forming a circle around him.

His eyes turn to saucers as the fire-mares round the curve and bear down on him. He yelps and dives into the swamp, along with the rest of his band. The fire-mares thunder past, leaving the thieves gulping swamp-water and the log road in flames.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. VALLEY OF REEDS - JUST BEFORE DAWN

Torquil leads half the band to the right, Colwyn leads the other half to the left. They sweep past the Slayers on either side, surrounding them with a ring of fire. The Slayers are enveloped by flames as the band reconverges and heads toward the high wall of the Fortress.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But a dismounted Slayer pierces the fiery wall, his clothes flaming, and hurls a spear at Rhun at the tail of the band. Colwyn and Torquil look back and see Rhun skewered by the spear, the point protruding from his chest. Torquil shakes his head and they continue toward the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But atop the wall, hidden behind the crenellated parapet, wait another dozen Slayers with cauldrons of boiling pitch at the ready.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Colwyn reaches the bottom of the wall and swings off his mare.
</DIRECTION>
<COLWYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Up the wall! Quickly!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLWYN>
<DIRECTION>
The others dismount and follow him up the wall, which is canted back some twenty degrees from the vertical, allowing them to clamber up the stone courses. But suddenly a stream of boiling pitch pours down the wall toward them.
</DIRECTION>
<TORQUIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TORQUIL>
<DIRECTION>
They dodge the hissing steam of pitch, but a second stream catches Oswin, who screams as he's enveloped by the boiling liquid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Colwyn and Torquil look up to see a cauldron of pitch being moved into position directly above them. But Torquil points down the wall where ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... the Cyclops is galloping along the parapet, the hooves of his fire-mare sparking against the stone. Titch stands on the saddle behind him, with a crossbow laid across his broad shoulder. The boy looses a bolt and hits one of the Slayers at the cauldron, saving Colwyn and Torquil.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Slayers loose a hail of arrows, several of which strike the Cyclops in the chest. But he keeps coming, and Titch keeps firing bolts from behind his shoulder, felling Slayers like deer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the twin suns are about to rise, the Slayers overturn the great cauldron of pitch, which pours down the wall, heading straight for Colwyn ...
</DIRECTION>

EXT. ARCTIC LANDSCAPE - SUNRISE

	On them!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLWYN>
<DIRECTION>
He leads the band up the wall to the parapet, where the Cyclops has dismounted and is holding off several Slayers, shielding Titch, who is still firing his deadly bolts. A brief but fierce battle disposes of the Slayers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The band gathers around the fallen Cyclops. A dozen broken- off arrow shafts protrude from his body. He holds Ergo's small hand in one of his great paws.

His hand tightens with the pain that he has brought upon himself, then his fingers open slowly. Ergo stifles a sob as the great eye closes in death.
</DIRECTION>

Torquil calls Colwyn's attention to yet another group of Slayers in the distance. Colwyn leads the band across an ice bridge to a stone door encased in ice. They hack through the ice and swing open the door, which opens onto a set of stone stairs leading down.

The band moves down the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Above, the Slayers reach the stone door, but they're clearly reluctant to descend. One steps forward and starts down - but then hears the eerie screams of the Dark Ones below. He scurries back up and, with the others, backs away from the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the stairs below, the eerie screams are deafening, echoing through the stone corridors. Ynyr leads the band, taking them down the stairs, across a landing, and down another flight of stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Torquil notices mortar crumbling between the stones of the staircase.
</DIRECTION>
<TORQUIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TORQUIL>
<YNYR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, they are weakening. It takes great power to maintain the Fortress, and they have expended much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YNYR>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STONE CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The band hurries down the corridor, pursued by dozens of red eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<TORQUIL>
<DIRECTION>
(looking back)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're gaining on us.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(draws his sword)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We must slow them up with steel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TORQUIL>
<DIRECTION>
They are standing beneath a Romanesque arch that supports the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<COLWYN>
<DIRECTION>
(looks up at the arch)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Better stone than steel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLWYN>
<DIRECTION>
He draws his sword and inserts it beside the capstone of the arch, working the blade to loosen the mortar. Torquil follows his thought and begins chopping at the mortar on the other side of the capstone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The red eyes are almost on them when they finally succeed in dislodging the capstone. They jump back as the capstone falls and the arch collapses, blocking the corridor with a wall of stone rubble.
</DIRECTION>
<TORQUIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're resourceful, my lad.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(grins)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I tell you, one year under my tutelage and I could make you the Prince of Thieves.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TORQUIL>
<COLWYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Subject to the King, no doubt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLWYN>
<TORQUIL>
<DIRECTION>
(modest bow)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Naturally.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TORQUIL>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, a black claw bursts from the stone rubble and clutches Torquil by the neck. Colwyn quickly draws his sword and hacks off the arm, which disintegrates into gray ash.
</DIRECTION>
<TORQUIL>
<DIRECTION>
(fingering his neck)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A good thrust, my friend. Another second and there'd have been nothing between my head and shoulders but bad memories.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TORQUIL>
<COLWYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I intend to keep you alive, your majesty. So you can abdicate your throne and become my Warlord.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLWYN>
<TORQUIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps. If the pay is good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TORQUIL>
<DIRECTION>
Colwyn signals Ynyr, who leads the group down the corridor and then down yet another flight of stone stairs. They emerge in ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAVERN OF AGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A pillared cave, pitch black. We hear the rasping sound of labored breathing, as of old men close to death.
</DIRECTION>
<COLWYN>
<DIRECTION>
(calls softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay together.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLWYN>
<DIRECTION>
They move through the cave, weapons at the ready. A feeble voice calls out.
</DIRECTION>
<OLD_TORQUIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Torquil ...

<DIRECTION>
Torquil turns to see a wizened, hollow-eyed old man: himself at the end of his life.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Do not let this happen, Torquil.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_TORQUIL>
<DIRECTION>
A PRIESTESS OF YOUTH steps out from behind a pillar: she is eighteen, wearing a transparent garment that shows the stunning beauty of her young body. She holds a golden goblet containing a rainbow-colored liquid.
</DIRECTION>
<PRIESTESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It need not happen, Torquil. Drink the rainbow. It is youth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRIESTESS>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches behind the pillar and takes the hand of YOUNG TORQUIL, pulling him into view: it is Torquil as he was at eighteen.
</DIRECTION>
<PRIESTESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is your youth, Torquil.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRIESTESS>
<YNYR>
<DIRECTION>
(touches Torquil)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the Cavern of Age. Touch nothing, take nothing, or the future will be plunged into your heart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YNYR>
<DIRECTION>
Torquil shudders as he looks at the old man he will become, horrified by the gaping face of his own future. Colwyn takes his arm and gently pulls him away. But the Priestess of Youth slips ahead, appearing again with the Young Torquil, this time in passionate embrace. As she caresses the youth, she holds out the goblet to Torquil.
</DIRECTION>
<PRIESTESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drink the rainbow, Torquil. Youth is yours. I am yours. Take me, Torquil.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRIESTESS>

(guiding him past)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She lies, my friend.

Now it is Ergo's turn to confront the future. He sees himself as an old man, bald and shrunken, at the edge of death.
</DIRECTION>
<OLD_ERGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ergo, save yourself. Save yourself from this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_ERGO>
<DIRECTION>>From behind a pillar appears a FAIRY PRIESTESS OF YOUTH, golden-haired, beautiful, holding a gold goblet. She tilts the goblet and pours some of the rainbow liquid into her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<FAIRY_PRIESTESS>

(holds out her cupped hand)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drink from my hand, Ergo. I can save you.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Ergo starts toward her, but Titch grabs his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<TITCH>
<DIRECTION>
(yanking him back)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ergo!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITCH>
<DIRECTION>
Ergo allows himself to be pulled along, gazing back wistfully.
</DIRECTION>
<ERGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, she was so beautiful - and I was so ugly.

<DIRECTION>
Bringing up the rear of the group is Kegan. He looks to the side and gasps in horror as he sees himself at age eighty, writhing on the floor, wracked by the pain of a horrible last illness.
</DIRECTION>
<OLD_KEGAN>
<DIRECTION>
(gasping)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Disease and pain, Kegan. This is your future.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_KEGAN>
<DIRECTION>
A PRIESTESS OF YOUTH appears. She is very young, perhaps fifteen, with the kind of beauty that makes a man catch his breath. She holds out the goblet, her face full of compassion and concern.
</DIRECTION>
<VERY_YOUNG_PRIESTESS>
<DIRECTION>
(pleading with him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh please, Kegan, don't let this happen. Come to me as you were.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERY_YOUNG_PRIESTESS>
<DIRECTION>
A YOUNG KEGAN steps out beside her. He is sixteen, a golden youth.
</DIRECTION>
<VERY_YOUNG_PRIESTESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come to me young, Kegan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERY_YOUNG_PRIESTESS>
<DIRECTION>
She steps forward, moving very close to him.
</DIRECTION>
<VERY_YOUNG_PRIESTESS>
<DIRECTION>
(whispers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your youth is in the goblet, come to me in the rainbow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERY_YOUNG_PRIESTESS>
<DIRECTION>
No mortal man could resist her. She holds the goblet to his lips and he drinks.
</DIRECTION>
<TORQUIL>
<DIRECTION>
(sees him and shouts)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kegan!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TORQUIL>
<YNYR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is too late. He has drunk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YNYR>
<DIRECTION>
The Priestess embraces Kegan. As they kiss, a rainbow arches down and envelopes them in its multi-colored light. But the colors soon fade and the rainbow becomes an arc of white light, growing brighter and more intense. In the blinding light, the Priestess begins to age, turning old before our eyes, as does Kegan himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The others watch, frozen in horror, as Kegan struggles to escape her embrace. But she clutches him with bony fingers, pressing her wrinkled mouth to his. They topple to the floor, writhing in each other's arms, their skin turning to parchment. The writhing stops. Two skeletons lie on the floor, locked in fatal embrace, the white bones shimmering in the arc of light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the others continue through the cave, Ergo takes Titch's hand and places it on his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<ERGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep a tight hold, boy, in case I get any more crazy ideas.
	</DIALOGUE>

INT. OUTER WALL OF VORTEX
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The band approaches the curving bloodstone wall of the Vortex. Great circular openings in the wall indicate the terminal of the Arms.
</DIRECTION>
<YNYR>
<DIRECTION>
(to Colwyn)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They will hold Lyssa in the Center of the Vortex, the place of the Beast, where its power is greatest. No man can match it there. Lyssa must try to move toward us. For as we enter the Vortex and move closer ...

<COLWYN>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
At the outer wall, the band is midway between two of the Arms. Ynyr looks from one to the other, then chooses the one on the left.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And in the Center, Lyssa must make a similar choice, for the spiral begins midway between two of the Arms. She also chooses the one on the left. She holds the shining glaive in front of her as she moves into the Arm and we hear the scrape of talons and the gutturals of frustration as the red eyes are forced to retreat before it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FIRST ARM OF VORTEX
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The band moves down the curving Arm, toward the Center.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SECOND ARM OF VORTEX
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lyssa moves out the adjacent Arm, away from the Center. She holds her glaive in front of her, forcing back the red eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CENTER OF VORTEX
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The huge red eyes of the Beast rise toward the top of its hole. We hear a hideous scream of rage as the Beast discovers Lyssa gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We do not actually see it emerge from its hole, but we see the reaction of the lesser Dark Ones guarding the passages: they shrink in fear, fleeing up the passages as the Beast climbs out of its hole and up the side of the spiral funnel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the Beast moves into the west passage, we catch a glimpse of one taloned foot: it is so large that the mind can't conceive of a living creature this huge. It leaves behind a trail of black mud mixed with fragments of a bizarre seaweed: dark red, with spiral leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SECOND ARM OF VORTEX
</DIRECTION>

Lyssa glances back fearfully as she hears the Beast coming up the Arm.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cut. Cut!
	</DIALOGUE>
</YNYR>
<DIRECTION>
Colwyn stares at him for a moment, then unsheathes his sword, grips it with both hands, and swings it at the stone wall. The blade strikes the stone with a spine-shivering clang. He swings again - another clang. But on his third swing, the blade bites into the rock, sinking to a depth of several inches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the next swing, the blade penetrates deep into the rock, and on the next, it slices all the way through, tearing loose chunks of stone. Colwyn swings the sword back and forth like a scythe, cutting his way through the solid rock, spraying fragments behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the other passage, Lyssa presses herself against the wall, watching the Beast's eyes come closer. Suddenly, a chuck of rock bursts out of the wall near her as Colwyn cuts through. He seizes her arm and pulls her through the hole, into the adjacent passage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ynyr lays a hand on Colwyn's shoulder as he embraces Lyssa.
</DIRECTION>
<YNYR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must move quickly. The Beast will stop at nothing now.

Ynyr smiles indulgently. Colwyn shrugs in embarrassment.
</DIRECTION>
<COLWYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't mean it that way. But you cannot stay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLWYN>
<DIRECTION>
Ynyr takes Colwyn and Lyssa by the arm and moves up the passage.

INT. OTHER ARM OF VORTEX
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Beast moves toward the hole in the passage wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RESUME - COLWYN ET. AL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They hear the Beast tearing at the stone wall, enlarging the hole to allow it to pass through. Ynyr nudges Colwyn and Lyssa up the passage.
</DIRECTION>
<YNYR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go now.
	</DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

The wet-eyed Ergo is too choked with emotion to approach the old man. Ynyr lays a hand on Titch's head.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take care of Ergo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YNYR>
<TITCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITCH>
<DIRECTION>
The five move up the passage.
</DIRECTION>
<COLWYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quickly, or he will waste his life for nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLWYN>
<DIRECTION>
They increase their pace. Ynyr watches them until they disappear, then backs slowly up the passage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A section of wall explodes inward as the Beast tears his way through. Ynyr sees the red eyes and places a hand on his glaive.
</DIRECTION>
<YNYR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You and I were destined to meet, my friend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YNYR>
<DIRECTION>
He flings his glaive, which flies to a point ten feet in front of him and hangs in midair, glowing.
</DIRECTION>
<YNYR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I am not so old that I can be swatted like a fly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YNYR>
<DIRECTION>
He thrusts his hand forward - the glaive leaps toward the Beast, giving off a blinding light. The Beast roars and retreats.
</DIRECTION>
<YNYR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, not so old as that, my black beauty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YNYR>
<DIRECTION>
Now the red eyes narrow as the Beast focuses its power on the glaive. The weapon is pushed backwards, slowly but surely.
</DIRECTION>
<YNYR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, you will have to attack me directly to kill me. I will cost you power, my dark friend. Much power.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YNYR>
<DIRECTION>
He thrusts his hand out and the glaive leaps forward - but only a few feet this time. The Beast's power stops it, then continues to push it back toward the old man. He holds out his clenched fist and stops the glaive about five feet in front of him. The Beast's power is so tremendous, however, that the arms of the weapon begin bending backward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, one of the horizontal arms snaps off and flies toward Ynyr, grazing his shoulder. He staggers back, but manages to hold the glaive steady. The other horizontal arm snaps off and buries itself in his chest. He goes down on one knee but continues to hold the glaive steady, though the weapon is now reduced to its vertical axis.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, his strength gives out. He drops his arm. The vertical blade spins toward him and pierces his throat. The beast moves past his crumpled body, up the passage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VERY WIDE STAIRCASE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The five make their way up the staircase to a landing. As Torquil starts up the next flight, Colwyn calls him back.
</DIRECTION>
<COLWYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We must find a smaller passage, where it cannot follow.

</COLWYN>

They move down a corridor to ...

They move to the door, which opens onto a long stairway leading up. At the top, we can see snow blowing past the opening.

They hear the Beast coming closer and start up the long stairway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LONG STAIRWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the five make their way upward, a terrible noise from below makes them stop and look back: the Beast is tearing away the rock, enlarging the passage to follow them. They quicken their pace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Along the stairs are small piles of fine powder: the mortar between the stones is crumbling and trickling down the walls.

The five emerge from the staircase and make their way across the Arctic landscape, toward the outer wall. Colwyn looks back and sees the Beast tearing its way out of the Fortress.
</DIRECTION>
<COLWYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Make for the wall. I'll catch up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLWYN>
<TORQUIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Colwyn, don't be a fool. You can't do battle with that thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TORQUIL>
<COLWYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's no way to outrun it. You know that. This is what Ynyr was preparing me for. It's what he died for.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLWYN>
<LYSSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll be killed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYSSA>
<TORQUIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry. I'll tap him on the head with my sword hilt if I have to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TORQUIL>
<COLWYN>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly, but with iron authority)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll lead the others to the wall as I tell you. Now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLWYN>
<DIRECTION>
Torquil bows to Colwyn's authority; he leads the others toward the wall. Colwyn pulls off his hauberk, useless in this battle, and faces the Beast in his tunic. The wind whips the thin cloth as he advances across the ice to where the Beast waits, obscured by the thickly falling snow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, a gigantic chunk of ice flies straight at him. He raises his hand and the ice shatters, streaking past him harmlessly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now he begins to concentrate, focusing his power until his body gleams - then shimmers - then bursts into flame with tongues of white fire leaping from his body as if it had been doused in gasoline. The flame is under his power; it doesn't harm him, nor does it melt the snow he walks on. It only harms when he wills it - as when he sees a patch of Dark Ones approaching from the side. He sweeps his arm toward them and an arc of flames rolls across the ice like a wave, washing over them and leaving their charred bodies writhing in the snow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Beast is moving back and forth in an area of ice ridges and hummocks, dimly visible through the heavy snowfall. Near it is a stone tower, some fifty feet high. The tower is suddenly lifted from the ground and hurled at Colwyn. He makes a downward chop with his hand and the tower splits in the middle, the two pieces flying past on either side of him.
</DIRECTION>
<COLWYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am no feeble old man for you to crush with two blows.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(moves forward, grim-faced)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is for that old man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLWYN>
<DIRECTION>
He sweeps his arm toward the Beast and an arc of flame rolls across the ice. As the Beast sidesteps, the flaming arc slices off the top of an ice hummock, leaving the flat surface boiling and steaming from the heat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Colwyn presses forward, driven by grief and rage. He launches a second arc of flame, one end of which catches the Beast's side. The Beast roars with pain and retreats, driven back by Colwyn's power. He launches a third arc, and this one strikes the Beast's head, staggering it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Beast is wounded now: one of its huge eyes is swollen half shut, the skin around it badly charred. Enraged, the Beast counterattacks. Huge projectiles streak toward Colwyn: first come blocks of ice, then great fragments of stone. Finally, the stone fragments begin to burn, screaming through the air like meteors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The projectiles shatter against Colwyn's protective shield of flame, but the force of repeated impact drives him backward. Small fragments of ice and stone actually pierce the shield, tearing his tunic, cutting his skin. He is bleeding from several flesh wounds and his forehead is burned by a fragment of flaming rock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But the Beast's power is not infinite. The hail of projectiles slows, then stops. Colwyn resumes his advance. He chops his arm downward: we hear a sharp crack and an ice hummock EXPLODES near the Beast. He chops again and an ice ridge EXPLODES, leaving a deep crack in the ice. The Beast hurls another projectile, but Colwyn brushes it aside as if it were a mosquito and sweeps an arc of flame at the Beast to back it off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he resumes chopping with his arm: crack followed closely on crack as the ice around the Beast is sliced and shattered by Colwyn's power. The section of ice on which the Beast stands suddenly drops a foot or so. The Beast hurls a final projectile, then Colwyn cracks the ice again. We hear a deep RUMBLE and a huge section of ice collapses, falling into the depths of the Fortress, carrying the Beast with it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watching from a distance, Torquil sees the exhausted Colwyn staggering on the ice, barely able to stand.
</DIRECTION>
<TORQUIL>
<DIRECTION>
(to the others)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll get him. Make for the wall.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TORQUIL>
<DIRECTION>
Torquil heads for Colwyn. Ergo pushes Lyssa and Titch toward the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<ERGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quickly, quickly to the wall.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERGO>
<DIRECTION>
But Ergo himself turns around and follows Torquil to where Colwyn is stumbling on the ice. Dark Ones flit between the ice hummocks, converging on them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Torquil helps Colwyn toward the wall, Ergo forms a rear guard, armed with butcher knives from his voluminous coat. As Dark Ones lunge out of the swirling snow, the little man faces them fearlessly, hurling his knives with deadly aim to protect his friends: one creature falls with a knife between the eyes, another with a knife in the neck, a third pierced through the heart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They reach the parapet, where Torquil and Lyssa help Colwyn over the wall. The five clamber down the face of the wall and Torquil is about to jump off onto the icy ground.
</DIRECTION>
<COLWYN>
<DIRECTION>
(points to horizon)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLWYN>
<DIRECTION>
The two suns are about to come up. They remain on the wall - except for Ergo, who slips on a sheet of ice and slides toward the ground. Titch reaches out and grabs his hand, holding him on the wall, though Ergo's legs are buried in snow up to the knees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FOREST VALLEY - SUNRISE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clinging to the wall, the five look out on a green valley. Ergo's legs are still buried to the knees, but in the ground. The stones of the wall are shifting. The Fortress is collapsing.
</DIRECTION>
<COLWYN>
<DIRECTION>
(jumps to the ground)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Away from the wall!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLWYN>
<DIRECTION>
Torquil and Colwyn haul Ergo out of the ground and move away from the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They watch the Fortress crumble.
</DIRECTION>
<COLWYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a fitting monument for Ynyr and Quell and the others.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLWYN>
<DIRECTION>
The Fortress sinks from sight, leaving a green valley in its place.
</DIRECTION>
<LYSSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a better one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYSSA>
<COLWYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLWYN>
<DIRECTION>
They make their way across the glen, Colwyn and Lyssa with arms around each other, Titch riding on Torquil's shoulder, and the Ergo-puppy riding on Titch's.
</DIRECTION>
<LYSSA>
<DIRECTION>
(looks around)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's Ergo?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYSSA>
<DIRECTION>
Titch hands her the Ergo-puppy, who licks her face. She laughs and sets the puppy down. It runs in front of them, frisking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PEASANT FAMILIES come out of the forest and join them. Children chase the puppy through the grass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
