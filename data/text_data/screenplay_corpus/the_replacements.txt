	EXT. MARINA DEL REY - DAY
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
It's raining lightly in the harbor and the water around the moored boats looks dirty and cold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We PICK UP a sad excuse for a boat sitting in an end slip.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a sea-gull-shitcovered, thirtyfoot cabin cruiser that hasn't cruised in a long, long time. A ratty looking unpainted plywood addition has been nailed to the top of the cabin. It's partially covered with a blue plastic tarp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUPERIMPOSE: MARINA DEL REY, CALIFORNIA - FALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tarp moves and SHANE FALCO's half-naked torso emerges from under it. Shane is late twenties, golden boy handsome, but quickly going to seed. He looks hung over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shane glances up at the sky and rain. He pulls on the top part of an old patched wet suit and zips it up. He shivers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MARINA DEL REY HARBOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We're BUZZING around the harbor with Shane in an old Zodiac inflatable DINGHY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shane has pulled up the attached rubber hood to his wet suit so that only the white, pasty oblong of his face is visible.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's still raining as he steers the little boat around the sailboats and yachts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls up to a fiftyfoot sailboat and CUTS the ENGINE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With practiced moves, he ties the dinghy to the rear rail of the sailboat and clips a bill for services rendered on the sailboat's stern line.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He slips on a weight belt, puts on a pair of old gaffer taped goggles, jams the end of a air-hose in his mouth, and falls backward out of the dinghy and into the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's dark, dirty and murky. Suddenly, Shane floats INTO FRAME and comes AT us with a long spatula.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He attacks the underside of the sailboat which is covered with green algae muck that hangs a foot off the bottom of the boat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The spatula scrapes away the green mess revealing the pure white underside of the boat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON SHANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he scrapes. Muck from the boat floats past him. This doesn't look like fun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he works, he happens to look down and notices something on the bottom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHANE'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amidst the beer cans and other trash, something golden is sitting on the bottom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shane takes a deep pull on his hose, lets it go and drifts down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A shaft of sunlight penetrates the murky water and reveals a broken trophy half-buried in the mud. Shane kneels over it and picks it up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The trophy is almost a full-size football rendered in bronze attached to a broken base.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shane turns "the ball" over in his hands. He grips the seams like he's done this before.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he holds the football out in front of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, he starts barking garbled signals to an imaginary offense. He turns to his running back as he yells something like "Blue 31!" It comes out in bubbles
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He cocks his left leg and his wide receiver goes in motion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then on the "snap" he turns and starts a five step drop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He moves in slow motion because hey... he's underwater! He executes a perfect play action fake on the third step of his drop, and looks "down field" for his receivers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But there's a blitz! He steps up in the pocket but a linebacker's arm almost takes his head off. He dodges, he bobs, he weaves in a kind of delicate ballet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He rolls left and keeps looking for the open man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly he points down field, pulls up and cocks his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The "ball" comes behind his ear and snaps forward in a perfect release.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The trophy spins OUT OF FRAME but we HOLD ON Shane as he watches his pass. Suddenly, he throws both arms up in a touchdown signal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We STAY ON him as he freezes in this pose of victory, fifteen feet underwater, on the trash-covered, muddy bottom of Marina Del Rey.

Bam! A Miami Dolphin linebacker crushes a Washington Redskin running back and lands on his throat, elbow first.

It's a beautiful fall day in November and Miami is beating the Skins in front of seventy-six thousand crazed Washington fans. The Redskins are at their home stadium better known as "The Big O."

ON REDSKINETTES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Twelve striking-looking women dressed in burgundy and gold are doing some inane chatter to a section of fans that ignore them.

The Redskin quarterback moves to the huddle.

<SUMMERALL>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Here we go: Third down, eight seconds to play, ball on the Dolphins' thirty-three yard line. Skins down by a touchdown.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUMMERALL>
<DIRECTION>
The huddle breaks and Martel sets up over the center.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Green 48! Green 48! Hut! Hut!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTEL>
<DIRECTION>
The ball is snapped and Martel drops back. He looks for a receiver and doesn't see anybody.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He steps up in the pocket, sees an opening and takes off running down field.
</DIRECTION>
<MADDEN>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There goes Martel!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MADDEN>
<DIRECTION>
Martel is a pretty good broken field runner for a big guy. Plus with the defense covering every possible receiver, he's got a lot of daylight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nobody has touched him as he crosses the fifteen. Suddenly, a safety, smaller than Martel, looms in front of him at the ten.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Martel goes down in one of those wimpy quarterback slides before the safety can even hit him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BANG! The GUN sounds and the game is over.

We'll see these guys throughout. They're typical low level Washington bureaucrats named TODD, ROD and BOB who live for the Hogs -- the traditional name for the Redskin offensive linemen.

Todd is shirtless and his entire upper body is painted Redskin red.

At that moment, they are livid with their quarterback and Bob is speaking for them all.

INT. LARGE BEDROOM - DAY

The room's blinds are pulled tightly against the bright sunlight. Only the blue light of a TV illuminates anything.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, we hear an old man in the bed give out with a loud piercing wail.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door to the room bangs open and an English male nurse named AUGUSTINE RIPLEY, dressed in white, comes running in. He's carrying a syringe in each hand, poised at the ready.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He runs to the bed of the still wailing EDWARD FRANCIS O'NEIL (75). O'Neil is hooked up to an oxygen tank, watching the just completed Redskin game with the sound off.

	Did they win or lose?!

He puts one needle down and jabs O'Neil with the other one.

He murmurs to the old man as he injects him.

<AUGUSTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice medicine for a loss. Keeps us calm. Makes us not so sad. Keeps us on an even keel. Gives us some perspective, doesn't it? And we'll save the winning medicine for next Sunday, won't we?

A bunch of BIKER types are cooking up a vat of speed. These guys are big, and badasslooking.

The other biker shakes his head, no.

The one who asked the question walks over to the door and listens for a beat. Nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns to go back and suddenly the door disintegrates in front of a charging man wearing a "police" windbreaker.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is DANIEL BATEMAN, a big, young, psychotic cop, who immediately runs over the poor Biker who was listening at the door, kicking the guy in the head as he goes by.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bateman dives on two more Bikers, and
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
viciously head-butts one of them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stuffs the other's head into the meth mixture, pulls him out and clubs him with a big police blackjack, three quick times: Rap! Rap! Rap!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The guy goes down like lead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bateman looks around and spots a big BIKER cowering in a corner. The Biker is terrified.

Bateman takes two stops toward the guy when suddenly three more COPS wearing windbreakers run in, out of breath.

Suddenly, the artist formerly known as Prince comes off stage, grabs a towel from an assistant and starts walking with Jamal in front and Andre in the rear.

	My dad. He's a huge Redskin fan. For years. He's in his twenty-ninth year at the Senate Office Building. As a guard, not a senator. The only thing that keeps him going he says, is me and the Redskins. That's where I get it. My fan-ness.

A little boy stops one of the Redskins and asks for an autograph on a program. The

Andre and Jamal sit facing each other. Andre throws a vicious forearm at Jamal's head but Jamal catches it. They both nod in approval.

Lou Pacifico smokes and stares.

Bateman is leaning against a wall, fully dressed, helmet on. He's staring into space and smiling to himself. He looks terrifying.

He walks by defensive end/tight end Brian Murray and signs to him to have a good game. Murray signs back, "Thanks, Coach."

Cochran spots McGinty and puts down his Bible.

	Coach McGinty, I'd like to lead the team in the pregame prayer.

McGinty turns and bums an egg from Mickey and walks to the middle of the locker room.

He eats the egg as he turns slowly and takes in his players.

	A lot of people are waiting for you to fall on your asses today. And guess what? You're going to. But I don't give a shit if you look funny out there. Or if you miss a block, or drop a pass, or trip over your own dick. This is professional. And the difference between professional and amateur, between playing for the Washington Redskins and Michigan State is simply... money. You are being paid to win. Not just to play. Not just to learn how to be good sports. Not for the alumni. You are being paid to win. I don't care how the fuck you do it. But I'm demanding it. Because those guys whose place you're taking have forgotten that simple fact. So, go win it.

It hits a wire stretched across the ground inside the helmet.

He trips big-time into the side of the helmet. He bounces (it's inflated, remember?) to the other side, bounces again and is shot out of the front of it like a cannon ball.

ON CHEERLEADERS

Bateman bounces out of the helmet and takes out the first six cheerleaders.

Shane looks downfield, winds up, turns and fires the ball at Morris's head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ball goes like a bullet for five feet and then sticks like a dart in Morris's face guard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment, Morris is blinded.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And Shane is dumbfounded.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then Morris starts to wrestle the ball out of his mask.
</DIRECTION>
<SHANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHANE>
<DIRECTION>
Andre and Jamal grab onto Morris who starts stumbling down field with the ball still stuck in his helmet.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Morris intercepts! Wait! The ball is stuck in his face!
	</DIALOGUE>

But Morris won't go down. He's still trying to pry the ball loose as he throws off Jamal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he shakes off Andre.

<DIRECTION>
ON BRIAN MURRAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's in SLOW MOTION in midair, diving towards Morris.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MURRAY'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's absolutely QUIET (he's deaf, remember?) as he soars towards Morris's head, helmet and ball.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wham! Murray's full body weight hits Morris in the helmet, which flies off and rolls across the field with the ball still stuck in it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUT OF THE SILENCE, we suddenly hear the hit and the crowd roar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Morris goes down like a building with Murray buried in his throat.
</DIRECTION>

Todd, Rod and Bob are destroying Todd's den in reaction to the hit.

<DIRECTION>
ON BALL AND HELMET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's in the very chubby hands of Mickey Lee, who is rumbling downfield with the fumble/helmet recovery.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
New York players have been slow to pick this up because they, too, have been admiring the lick that Murray put on Morris.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the whole team is chasing Lee.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They catch him pretty easily at the twenty, but Lee represents a lot of weight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lee staggers across the ten, shaking players off left and right.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One defensive halfback sacrifices himself and throws himself at Lee's feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lee trips over the guy, gains his footing again, walks on the guy (who screams in
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
agony) and falls into the end zone carrying three players with him.

ON LEE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He gets up in jubilation, spikes the ball/helmet combination, and runs through the back of the end zone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But he doesn't stop. He's aiming for a low wall that separates the first row of fans from the field.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON FOUR FANS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They see Mickey rumbling at them and they all get the picture at the same time. They scream!

ON MICKEY

He launches himself into the stands in ecstasy.

We're CLOSE ON Bateman as he lines up for the kick-off. Everybody in the stadium knows that an on-side kick is coming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bateman is standing in the hot spot for recovering the ball.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shane and everyone with decent hands is on the field.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pacifico lines it up and boots it ten yards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ball takes a crazy hop, hits a Giant, and ricochets off him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bateman runs over two guys and grabs the ball on the bounce. He's got it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But Bateman doesn't go down. He turns and starts running across the field.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shane runs after him.
</DIRECTION>
<SHANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! Danny, go down! You're using up the clock!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHANE>
<DIRECTION>
But Bateman likes this new job: kick-off returner! Especially after he runs over a Giant and stiff-arms another.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bateman is finally trapped on the far sideline after gaining perhaps eight yards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
So, he turns and starts running back the other way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shane has been chasing him and now sees Bateman running back at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shane has no choice but to throw himself in front of Bateman's legs.

Bateman goes down.

	Good evening from the Big O here in Washington D.C. where the mighty Dallas Cowboys take on the Cinderella Washington 'Scabskins' as they have come to be known. Hi, I'm Al Michaels and we are witnesses to a unique matchup tonight as Shane Falco and a contingent of strike players go up against the entire regular squad of the Dallas Cowboys. Yes, you heard right: every Cowboy has now crossed the picket line, some as late as this afternoon, and they will all play tonight. Can a rag tag group of hasbeens and castoffs stand up to what was once called America's team? And what about the strike itself? It has been so ineffective that many predict it will be over before this game ends. Stay tuned as Boomer and Dan join me for strike ball, D.C. style.

Shane leans over Reese and takes in the Dallas defense.

Most of the Dallas players are down and screaming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jamal stands across from a DEFENSIVE LINEMAN. He hasn't touched the guy. But he nods to the player to look at his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The guy looks down just as Jamal flicks open a deadly-looking switchblade.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The guy jumps back and yells:
</DIRECTION>

Some Dallas players are livid:

</SHANE>

He looks around the huddle. He studies each face. And then he comes to rest on Brian Murray.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brian's eyes are shining. He doesn't need words here.
</DIRECTION>
<SHANE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</SHANE>
<DIRECTION>
Everybody puts their hands into the middle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They break the huddle with a roar.

	</DIALOGUE>
</SHANE>
<DIRECTION>
Shane nods. On the snap, Shane rolls left.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON REESE EVANS

ON MURRAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He cuts on a deep post.

<DIRECTION>
ON SHANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He steps up and throws a clean bullet downfield. He roars in pain as he throws it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON MURRAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pass is perfect. He pulls it in and beats his man to the end zone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Redskins win.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON CROWD

<DIRECTION>
ON EDDIE MARTEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Washington Redskins first-string quarterback is so pissed off he jumps up from his seat and turns quickly to go up the steps and out of the stadium.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But he slips awkwardly and falls. He grabs his knee and screams.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON BRIAN MURRAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's still in the end zone, holding the ball up to the crowd. The roar is deafening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BRIAN'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We HEAR NOTHING, but somehow the pure energy of the moment comes through.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON SHANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN the SILENCE, he's walking in SLOW MOTION toward Annabelle. And everybody is smiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
