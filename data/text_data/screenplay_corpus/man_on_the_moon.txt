INT. VOID - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standing in a nonexistent set is ANDY KAUFMAN, looking a bit nervous. Wide-eyed, tentative, he stares at us with a needy, unsettling cuteness. His hair is slicked-down, and he wears the "FRIENDLY WORLD" costume from the Andy Kaufman special.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, Andy speaks -- in a peculiar FOREIGN ACCENT.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
(AS FOREIGN MAN)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hallo. I am Andy. Welcoom to my movie.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat; he gets upset)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hoped the story of my life would be nice...but it turned out terrible! It is all LIES! Tings are mixed up... real people I knew play different people. WHAT A MESS! So I broke into Universal and cut out the junk. Now it's much shorter. In fact, this is the end of the movie. So tanks for comink! Bye-bye!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
Andy puts a needle on a phonograph, and swelling CLOSING CREDITS MUSIC starts to play. FINAL CREDITS roll.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy stands frozen, awkwardly looking at the audience. Every time the music ends he picks up the needle and restarts the music. He does that as many times as the credits require.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, CREDITS END. And then--a sly smile. He leans in. DROPS HIS ACCENT and WHISPERS.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
(AS REGULAR VOICE)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay! Just my friends are left. I wanted to get rid of those other people... they would have laughed in the wrong places.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Oops!! I wasn't supposed to talk about that! Oh. Eh, uh, we better just begin. It starts back in Great Neck, Long Island...

Andy turns to a primitive 16mm PROJECTOR and turns it on. WHIR! He smiles at the flickering light.

EXT. KAUFMAN HOUSE - 1957 - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BLACK AND WHITE image slowly becomes COLOR. Great Neck, 1957. An upper-class Jewish neighborhood. In the street, crewcut BOYS play t-ball, laughing and shouting. A fat convertible pulls up to the smallest house, and STANLEY KAUFMAN, 40, gets out. Still in his suit, he's a well- meaning slave to his job -- tired, responsible.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stanley goes over to admire the t-ball game. At bat is his son MICHAEL, 6, a natural charmer. Michael swings -- crack! -- and hits a solid single. Stanley smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's my boy! Good swingin', kiddo.

Baby CAROL is crying. Mom JANICE, 35, quickly peels carrots, trying to get dinner made. Stanley marches past.

The boy suddenly turns off, becoming introverted... awkward. Frustrated, Stanley stares at his son.
</DIRECTION>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Andy, this has to stop. Our house isn't a television station. There is not a camera in that wall.

Andy glances over at the wall. Hmm.

An uncomfortable beat -- and then Andy starts crying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The manager is dumbfounded. He doesn't know what to do.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tears are rolling pitifully down Andy's cheeks. The manager is confused -- totally disoriented. Shamed, Andy covers his face, then runs out. Silence. The manager stares after him... having no idea what just happened.

EXT. NY NIGHTCLUB - 1975 - NIGHT

Sobbing Andy bursts out the door. He steps onto the sidewalk -- and IMMEDIATELY STOPS CRYING. Just like that.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy lifts his big case and starts walking. Andy shakes his head angrily.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns down a dark street, hurrying alone through an unsavory New York neighborhood. But then... TWO MEN appear... silently approaching. Andy stops uncertainly -- debating whether to turn around. But in that second -- the thugs are upon him, glaring menacingly.

The Improv, the biggest comedy club around. People are lined up, waiting. The man strides up -- GEORGE SHAPIRO, a Hollywood talent manager. George is old school: Bronx accent, shmooze and a hug... but with a surprising sweetness that is quite disarming. A DOORMAN sees him, grins, and waves George in.

The bar is packed with COMICS and SHOW BIZ TYPES. A few turn and smile -- "George!" "Hey, George!" George takes a couple hands, whispers to someone else, then drifts into the...

Where the show's in progress. Owner BUDD FRIEDMAN sees George and gives him a bear-hug. Then he hustles George to a table.

<DIRECTION>
George sits -- and gives the stage his undivided attention. Up there is a WISEASS COMIC.
</DIRECTION>
<WISEASS_COMIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So I'm getting my mother-in-law a special Christmas present: A pre- paid funeral! The mortician asked me if I wanted her buried, embalmed or cremated. I said, "Make it all three! I'm not takin' any chances!"

<DIRECTION>
(the crowd LAUGHS)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you. Good night!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The comic waves and exits. APPLAUSE. George politely claps. A PIANO PLAYER jumps in with an upbeat show tune.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We think there's a break... when Andy suddenly, awkwardly steps on stage. He is in character as Foreign Man. Pink jacket, tie, hair slicked back, frightened like a deer in headlights. He puts down his big case, pulls out various junk, and arranges it on chairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room hushes, uncertain as to who the hell this guy is. Andy tentatively grabs the mike. The stagefright is agony.

People are embarrassed. Some avert their eyes. A couple hipsters laugh mockingly.

George leans forward. Andy wipes the sweat from his brow.

A woman LAUGHS caustically. Andy grins stupidly, then turns his back to us. He presses "Play" on a CASSETTE RECORDER... and the THEME FROM 2001 starts playing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
House lights dim dramatically. With a flourish, Andy pulls tape off his pants -- revealing rhinestones. He removes his pink coat -- putting on a white jeweled jacket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He combs his hair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he brushes his hair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he combs his hair some more.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally he picks up a guitar, strikes a pose -- and spins around.

<DIRECTION>
He is ELVIS. CONFIDENT. SEXY. LIP CURL. DEAD-ON PERFECT.

The crowd is blown away.

Vegas Elvis INTRO MUSIC suddenly blasts. Andy/Elvis swaggers stage left and takes a bow. Then he goes stage right and takes a bow. Then he returns stage left for another bow.

Andy pulls out a little Handi-wipe and cleanses his hands. Then he starts arranging the food in compulsive little piles: Beans in pinwheel shapes. Sprouts in piles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
George peers at the bizarre food behavior.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You show a lot of promise... but... my concern is I don't know where to book you. You're not a stand-up... your act doesn't exactly translate to films... help me... where do you see yourself?

</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
Andy dips his silverware in the water glass. Two dunks, then he dries it with his napkin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
George stares, perplexed. He looks back up -- and Andy's booger has suddenly switched nostrils.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Huh?
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See, I don't want easy laughs.
	</DIALOGUE>

Andy's about to eat -- but first bows his head in silent prayer. George raises an eyebrow. Andy snaps his head back up.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I want gut reactions! I want that audience to go through an experience. They love me! They hate me! They walk out -- it's all GREAT!
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Andy triumphantly eats a bean. George peers, unable to take the booger anymore. He hands Andy a napkin and points to his nose. Andy nods, removes the rubber booger, and carefully puts it in a little box.

<ANDY>

(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	After I'm famous, I can sell these as "Worn by Andy Kaufman."

George warmly extends his hand.

Andy slowly smiles, then takes George's hand. The men shake. A moment of supreme importance. EST. BEVERLY HILLS - DAY

The light is magical. Soothing SITAR music plays. Andy and fifteen other BAREFOOT STUDENTS sit on mats in a semi- circle. Eyes shut, bodies in different yoga positions, they are all meditating.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Facing them on a throne-like chair sits a reverent, Indian YOGI. At his feet is the class teacher, LITTLE WENDY, a teeny lady with an absurdly high-pitched voice.

The Yogi nods kindly.

	You always had a good heart. But I'm proud of the progress you've made in your discipline.

	</DIALOGUE>
</HOST>
<DIRECTION>
The SNL orchestra starts the intro into a song. Andy enters the stage with a boom box, and positions himself in front of the microphone. When the vocals are supposed to start, Andy doesn't open his mouth. Instead he looks around -- frightened. The band stops... and starts again. Andy remains mute. The Band stops again.

At that moment, Andy puts the boom box down and blares it loudly. The THEME FROM "MIGHTY MOUSE" plays -- but Andy just blankly stands there.

He's purposefully doing nothing.

Andy snaps his eyes open. He exhales a few calm breaths, then sits upright. Andy reaches for a sealed envelope, rips it open, and removes a SCRIPT.

Andy sighs, opens the script, and starts scanning the pages like a speedreader.

<ANDY>

</DIRECTION>

	It'll be great. The viewer will think their TV is broken. They'll get out of their chair, they'll twist the knobs, they'll hit the TV, but they won't be able to fix it!

</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
Maynard stares at the monitor. The totally indecipherable picture still rolls. A glum pause.

The onstage ORCHESTRA hits a fanfare. LIGHTS DIM. Sharp SPOTLIGHTS meet at the foot of the stage. Suddenly -- Tony swaggers out, hands over his head in a gesture of triumph.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thunderous APPLAUSE. Tony beams. The music stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
George leans in, curious as to how Andy will wiggle out of this.

Tony bows theatrically, turns back to face the orchestra, and waits. The NOISE LEVEL slowly drops -- but not entirely. Tony waits, and waits, and waits... until suddenly he turns towards the audience and SCREAMS FURIOUSLY.
</DIRECTION>
<TONY_CLIFTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	SHUT UP!!!!!!

</TONY_CLIFTON>
<DIRECTION>
Everybody looks up, alarmed. The general murmur almost dies. Tony stands there, eyes flashing with anger at all the unruly people. As they quiet down... Tony turns back to the orchestra and raises his arms. The MUSICIANS lift their instruments. Silence is total -- except for the clank of china.

Tony's outburst is so commanding that they all freeze. The waiters stand there like statues, staring in terror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Satisfied, Tony burns back to the orchestra and raises his arms. Again, the musicians lift their instruments. In anticipation of loud music, the waiters start moving about. Audience members start whispering. Tony hears this -- and drops his arms and head in despair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The musicians lower their instruments. Tony waits for absolute silence. Only then does he signal the musicians to get ready again. They do. And then at that precise moment -- somebody DROPS a spoon. Tony jolts, as if hit by a current. He drops his hands again, turns, and gives the perpetrator a murderous look. Then he turns again, lowers his head, and waits. And waits. And waits.

The man at George's table WHISPERS to his wife.

George grins stupidly. The silence is now deafening. Slowly, very slowly, Tony raises his arms. Slowly... the musicians get their instruments ready. Tony stands there, and stands, and stands, waiting for something... anything... to disturb the silence. In vain. Somebody COUGHS. The whole scene repeats itself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally -- finally -- Tony is surrounded by total silence. Then, (only a moment before the length of this scene would become unbearable), he begins to move. Tony pivots around, looks at the audience...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And the entire room looks like Tussaud's Wax Museum. Tony starts LAUGHING hysterically. The audience's reaction is mixed:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Some people LAUGH. Some BOO. Some ask perplexed questions. Some SCREAM OBSCENITIES. Some even APPLAUD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tony is very happy. He turns to the orchestra, raises his baton -- and commences the downbeat! The MUSIC BEGINS.

A SPOTLIGHT hits the wings... and then ANDY STRIDES OUT.

Tony Clifton grabs the microphone.

	George... I'm at a stage where the audience expects me to constantly shock them. But short of faking my death, or setting the theater on fire, I don't know what else to do.

	'Cause I've always got to be one step ahead of them.

Arnold Schwarzenegger, in his glory days as a body-builder, on the cover of a magazine. Magazines are everywhere. Body- building. Women's. Wrestling.

ANDY is sifting through them. Zmuda watches, worried.

Andy's face drops. He realizes Zmuda's right.

(emphatic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm doing this because I feel that a woman cannot beat a man in wrestling. Even if they train with weights... it requires a certain mental ability --

	<DIALOGUE>
	And, uh -- I just don't feel they have that...

The audience MURMURS uncomfortably. Andy laughs and backpedals.

<ANDY>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No no! Women are superior in many ways. When it comes to cooking and cleaning, washing the potatoes, scrubbing the carrots, raising the babies, mopping the floors, they have it all over men. I believe that!

An appalled silence.

Merv winces. Some people start BOOING. We can tell Andy is pleased.

	Will you please shake hands, go to your corners, and come out wrestling.

</ZMUDA>
<DIRECTION>
Lynne extends her hand. Andy fakes a shake -- then snidely refuses and struts away. The crowd HISSES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DING! It's the bell. The match begins. Lynne barrels at him, craving a victory, but terribly unprepared for this experience. Andy immediately grabs her by the legs and flips her over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHUMP! She's down. Andy has trained for this.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zmuda gets on his knees, watching, trying to look official. Lynne struggles and slithers away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She grabs Andy's arm and forces him down. People CHEER. His torso hits the mat. LOUDER CHEERS. But suddenly he rolls over and pulls her hair! Her head snaps back. The crowd is INCENSED. Zmuda hurries over and pantomimes a stern warning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy nods, and they separate. They do a little dance around the ring, Lynne looking for a hole. Suddenly, Andy spins her into a Half-Nelson. Her arms are pinned. They struggle, then he throws her down on her stomach. One! Two! Three!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And DING! It's OVER. Andy jumps up and sneers at the crowd.

<ANDY>

She rolls her eyes and waits. The REF jumps out of the way. A minute has counted down. Finally, Andy stops -- and the real wrestling begins. Foxy lunges at him and immediately goes for a choke-hold. The crowd CHEERS, relieved. Lawler motions signals. Foxy yanks -- but Andy jerks away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy is intrigued. She's coming to play! Andy gestures to the Ref and points UP. The Ref looks away -- and Andy SLAPS Foxy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd furiously JEERS. The Ref spins around, and Andy shrugs innocence. He then runs at Foxy and theatrically pushes her into the ropes. She bounces off, stumbles back - - and Andy drops to his knees. She trips over him and hits the mat.

<DIRECTION>
Andy aggressively jumps onto Foxy's shoulders and pins her. The Ref counts: One! Two! Three! DING!!

It's over. But Andy stays on her, shaking his ass, leering rudely. Jerry Lawler yells from the corner.

	Why?? I... I attend every year.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes -- we do not doubt your devotion to TM. But we feel that perhaps... you and the program have grown apart philosophically.

Andy is stunned.

	"Philosophically"?

	Of course I do...

The Yogi shakes his head. Andy can't believe it. He looks around -- men in turbans staring at him.

Andy cracks.

Andy is broken.

He fights to bottle his rage -- then notices Little Wendy down the corridor, peering helplessly. Beaten, Andy waves goodbye to her.

Little Wendy gulps, then waves goodbye too.

Suddenly DING-DONG! It's the doorbell.

Andy sits disoriented in the living room. Movers bustle around him. Mirrors get leaned against opposing walls -- and he finds himself looking into multiple reflections of himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the b.g., Lynne arranges some vases, then hurries out. Andy opens a box and pulls out his old Howdy Doody doll. He smiles, then places Howdy on the shelf next to the vases.

Suddenly a phone on the floor RINGS. He grins.

Andy hangs up. He just sits there... confused... unsure how to react.

Andy scratches his head -- then feels something odd. He goes over to the mirror. On the back of his neck... is an inflamed red pimple. Andy grimaces.

Very late -- a clock says 1:15. A YOUNG COMIC is onstage, performing to the DOZEN audience members left.

In back walks... Andy. Unshaven, morose, he quietly approaches paternal owner BUDD FRIEDMAN. Budd sees him, grins, and gives him a hearty hug. Andy points at the stage and asks for something -- Budd eagerly nods.

<ANDY>

	Actually, Budd, you're wrong. I found out today that Taxi's been canceled.

The crowd AWWWWS sadly. Andy blinks.

<ANDY>

	Yeah, that's how I felt too... though I don't know why. 'Cause for years, all I wanted to do was get off that show.

(quiet, very confessional)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But now that nobody will hire me, and nobody thinks I'm funny... I guess it was probably a pretty good job.

One guy LAUGHS sharply.

Andy gives him a look -- thinks -- then continues.

Andy turns. The red lump is bigger, grosser. The crowd GROANS, revolted.

	So I was thinking, since I'm sort of a quasi-celebrity, that I could charge people to touch it.

	See, that's exactly it! He picked lung cancer, because he doesn't smoke. That makes it weird! If he'd picked leukemia, it'd be totally believable, and we'd all be going, "Poor Andy, he's really sick." So he chose lung cancer, because he WANTS us to be scratching our heads, saying, "Is this real?"

EXT. LAUREL CANYON HOUSE - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sun is setting, purple and orange over the hills. Andy and George lie on chaise lounges, serenely staring out. Andy has a blank look on his face, and has lost more weight. He is a shadow of himself.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't move my arm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
(awkwardly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've got good days and bad days.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
Andy softly sighs.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My hair is coming out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
(whispers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
George silently pats Andy. Andy's energy is sapped, but he forces himself to be upbeat.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got an idea for a new TV show for me to star in. It's called "Uncle Andy's Fun House" -- it'll be a Saturday morning thing where I can goof off with the kids. You know, puppets, magic tricks...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
George is choked up. He goes along with it.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
(long pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think we can sell that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
Silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
George struggles not to shatter Andy's enthusiasm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy smiles gratefully.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey... thanks for always backin' me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
George clenches Andy's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did your -- doctor say it's okay for you to go back to work?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ehhh, you know those guys. If he had his way, I'd be stuck in the hospital, running tests all day.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And anyway, I've found a new guy who's gonna be able to instantly remove the cancer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
(startled)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah! He's a psychic surgeon in the Philippines, and he's amazing! He rubs you and sucks the disease right out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
Andy beams. George stares sadly.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Philippines? I dunno... Andy... he sounds like one of your characters.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT - ANDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His voice gets hushed.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No... this guy's special.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(very sincere)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He performs miracles.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
George doesn't know how to respond.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy looks up pleadingly.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>

	He's my last chance.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. BAGUIO CITY, PHILIPPINES - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Baguio, a tiny scratched-in-the-dirt Philippine city.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, a rattletrap COMMUTER PLANE lurches out of the sky. It hits a dirt runway. Dust flies. Chickens squawk and run.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEAT UP TAXI, PHILIPPINES - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy, Lynne, and Zmuda ride through the impoverished city.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy stares in amazement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CLINIC, PHILIPPINES - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They reach a brick building. A sign says "CLINIC," with an eye over a triangle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CLINIC, PHILIPPINES - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A NURSE hurriedly helps weakened Andy sign a bunch of forms. Money is handed over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy's clothes are stripped off. They're thrown in a locker.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CLINIC OPERATION ROOM, PHILIPPINES - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A large white tiled room. Lynne and Zmuda roll in pallid Andy, his limp body unmoving.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy looks up... and there's a LONG LINE OF SICKLY PEOPLE. Primarily Japanese, emaciated, all stripped to their underwear and barely able to stand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They have a look of desperation and reverence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the head of the line is JUN ROXAS at his work station: A bench, a sink, and ATTENDANTS with clean towels.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SICKLY WOMAN crawls onto the bench. Jun impassively presses his hand into the fatty flesh of her stomach, kneading, searching. Pause, then he removes some BLOODY GUTS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He flings them into a bucket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The woman cries out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy gasps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The woman is helped away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jun turns to wash his hands. An attendant gives him a towel to dry with. Then a SICKLY MAN crawls up...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy rolls closer. He stares at all this with fear. Nervousness. Hope.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jun impassively presses his hand against the man's head. He concentrates, searching... then pulls out some BLOODY GUTS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He flings them into a bucket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man shakes. He is helped away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy is wide-eyed. He gets closer... closer...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
More patients. More bloody guts. More sobbing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy's excitement builds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then -- he reaches the front.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lynne and Zmuda stare into Andy's eyes, drawn in by his total belief. They are overcome. It feels like they're saying goodbye. Lynne gives Andy a tender kiss. Zmuda starts to shake his hand -- and instead hugs him tightly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy smiles, then the attendants lift him from the wheelchair. They help him up to the bench.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy lies down. Fluorescent lights buzz overhead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks over, and Jun Roxas is washing his hands from the previous patient.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy shivers, anticipating the miracle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jun turns. An attendant gives him a towel to dry off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy relaxes, readying for it all...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He glances at Jun's hands. Jun hands back the towel -- and under it the attendant quickly slips Jun a sack of animal intestines.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jun discreetly palms it. He's a fake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP - ANDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A moment of stunned disbelief.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is shocked. Outraged. Disappointed. Flabbergasted.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The faith is meaningless. The joke is cosmic. The con man has been conned.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy's overpowering emotions coalesce... and he starts to LAUGH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's sidesplittingly funny. Andy LAUGHS, and LAUGHS, and LAUGHS, like a crazy man with no salvation, the joy releasing him, the tears rolling down his cheeks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His face flushes with color. Life sparkles in his eyes. Andy laughs and guffaws until he's hoarse. This is the best gag of them all.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy lies in peace in a casket. He has died.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His expression is pleasantly bland. Almost Latka-like. But his face is caked with so much funeral-home makeup, it almost looks like a mask.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We slowly widen. The casket is surrounded by beautiful flowers. We TILT UP... and high above... is a MOVIE SCREEN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the SCREEN is a projection of Andy, silently staring at us. There's a gentle smile on his face. It's the image from the opening of this film.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANDY'S POV: The chapel is filled with GRIEVING MOURNERS. All are in black. Everyone's quiet, in a state of shock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy's family is huddled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lynne sits alone in a pew, crying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
George gives Zmuda a hug. Little Wendy comes over... and they comfort each other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone who ever knew Andy is there: Taxi cast, Fridays cast, TM followers, hookers, Jerry Lawler, Ed Weinberger, Maynard Smith, Budd Friedman, it goes on and on...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And -- they all have odd discombobulated expressions. They stare up at the PROJECTED ANDY.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
(ON FILM)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... My show is over. I did my best, and I just want to say, until we meet again... please remember:
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he begins to SING)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"In this friendly, friendly world... With each day so full of joy. Why should any heart be lonely."
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
Some gathered people tentatively join in the SINGING.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
(ON FILM) (cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So everybody! Put your arm around the person next to you, even if you don't like that person. Come on!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he resumes SINGING)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"The world is such a wonderful place, To wander through, When you've got someone to love, To wander along with you. With the sky so full of stars, And the river so full of songs, Every heart should be so thankful, Thankful for this friendly, friendly world..."
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
The curtain behind the coffin OPENS and the casket with Andy's body slowly slides into the DARKNESS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The curtain closes. The FILM ENDS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And all goes silent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Some people cry. Some begin to leave. Most of them are just staying, numbed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
George and Zmuda whisper.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a perfect Kaufman audience.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<ZMUDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. They don't know whether to be sad, or angry.

</ZMUDA>

The Taxi cast are flustered.

	Why are people leaving? The curtain's gonna open. Andy's gonna come out... I know it!

	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, the body was just made of wax...!

(a very long beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wasn't it......?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONY_DANZA>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. They look to the front.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The closed curtain wafts... then settles motionless.

<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. SUNSET BLVD./COMEDY STORE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SUPER slowly appears: "EXACTLY ONE YEAR LATER"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On Sunset, TWO DUDES come riding along on skateboards. Suddenly they reach -- INSANITY. Traffic on Sunset is jammed. HONKING limousines jockey to squeeze by.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Confused, one Dude squints into the distance -- and his eyes pop.
</DIRECTION>
<DUDE_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my GOD.

(stupefied)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the freakiest thing I've ever seen!! Look!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUDE_2>
<DIRECTION>
He points. His friend turns -- and gasps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE COMEDY STORE - The marquee says "TONY CLIFTON: LIVE!"
</DIRECTION>
<DUDE_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Man, we were right! He's not dead!

<DUDE_2>

	He's just been lyin' low for a year! WE GOTTA GO!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUDE_2>
<DIRECTION>
Hysterical, the guys race up to the club. But outside, there's a CRAZED, PULSING MOB. People are screaming. Police have barricades. Everybody cries to get in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COMEDY STORE - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's packed. Every square inch is filled with glittery Hollywood VIPs. People make chit-chat... but there is a squeamish excitement in the air. A brooding unease. Nobody knows what to expect.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly -- the lights go black. A BOOMING ANNOUNCER.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNOUNCER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ladies and Gentlemen! Please put your hands together for... Tony Clifton!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNOUNCER>
<DIRECTION>
The THEME FROM 2001 starts playing. "DAAAAA, DAAAAA, DAAAAA! DA-DAAAAA"!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small SPOT appears -- on a peach tuxedo. The light grows bigger, bigger... the tension magnifying... people gasping... our view widening... until Tony Clifton is revealed onstage!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's an extraordinary theatrical moment -- without response. The crowd has no idea what to do.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tony smirks.
</DIRECTION>
<TONY_CLIFTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How ya doin'?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONY_CLIFTON>
<DIRECTION>
Dead silence.

Still no response. Until -- a lone reckless VOICE.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Andy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Whoa. The crowd rustles nervously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tony grimaces.
</DIRECTION>
<TONY_CLIFTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't know nothin' about no Andy. Just some dead guy tryin' to ride my coattails.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's HIT IT, boys! One, two, anda one two three four!

	<DIALOGUE>
	"First I was afraid I was petrified. Kept thinkin' I could never live Without you at my side."

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Were you the one that tried to Hurt me with goodbye? Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and Die...?"
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONY_CLIFTON>
<DIRECTION>
We PAN the room full of enthralled spectators. At a front table are George and Lynne.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tony attacks the chorus.

	<DIALOGUE>
	"Oh no not I! I WILL SURVIVE! As long as I know how to love, I know I'll simply stay alive!"
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONY_CLIFTON>
<DIRECTION>
In the crowd, we pass face after face -- smiling... frowning... intrigued... confused... until we settle on a man in the very last row.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bob Zmuda.

Enjoying the show more than anyone.

The music CRESCENDOS, and the song ENDS.

Zmuda grins and APPLAUDS proudly.

FADE OUT. THE END
