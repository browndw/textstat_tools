EXT. A STREET NEAR BRICK LANE - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's 5.30pm in late December and rain is pouring. The scant Christmas decorations are hanging limp in the rain. A young Turk (EKREM) runs through the rain with a Turkish newspaper held over his head. He ducks into a traditional barber's shop called Ozim's.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OZIM'S BARBER SHOP - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shutters are drawn. OZIM (a plump middle-aged Turk) is cutting the hair of the last customer of the day (SOYKA). Soyka is a Chechen, well-groomed, wearing a sharp suit beneath the barber's gown.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
During the conversation we glimpse distinctive eagle- and star-shaped tattoos on Soyka's arms and hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ozim and Soyka are chatting as Ekrem enters. Soyka speaks with a Russian accent.
</DIRECTION>
<OZIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guvenilmez... daginik... bloody kids, you know... he says - `but Amca it's Christmas?... Christmas! We're Islam!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OZIM>
<SOYKA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oi, how much are you taking off?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOYKA>
<OZIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Christmas! So I said to him... alisverise cimac. The kid's sixteen...
	</DIALOGUE>
</OZIM>
<DIRECTION>
Ozim brushes some hair off the customer's shoulder and Ozim finally acknowledges Ekrem, who is shivering and wet near to the door. Ekrem turns the `Open' sign to `Closed'.
</DIRECTION>
<OZIM>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uncle Ozim.......

</EKREM>
<DIRECTION>
We see for the first time that Ekrem is shaking with fear as well as cold.
</DIRECTION>
<OZIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is him. The kid I'm talking about.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OZIM>
<DIRECTION>
Ekrem approaches, stiffened by terror. Soyka nods at Ekrem in the mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<SOYKA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He looks OK to me... how you doin' Ekrem?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOYKA>
<DIRECTION>
Soyka offers Ekrem a hand to shake and Ekrem stares at it as if it were enchanted...
</DIRECTION>
<OZIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He looks OK, yeah, but he won't do one lousy thing for me. Here, look... Ekrem, take this...
	</DIALOGUE>
</OZIM>
<DIRECTION>
Ozim takes an open razor from behind a line of hair-tonic bottles and hands it to Ekrem, who now looks mortally terrified.
</DIRECTION>
<EKREM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ozim... memnum etmek.

	Hey Ozim, leave the kid alone. It's obviously a psychological thing...

</SOYKA>
<OZIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take it Ekrem.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OZIM>
<SOYKA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ozim, it's OK. I don't want a shave.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOYKA>
<OZIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the kid who walks around like Al Capone. Take the fucking ustura and finish this Rushca.

</OZIM>
<SOYKA>
<DIRECTION>
(startled)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOYKA>
<DIRECTION>
Soyka rises up from the seat, casting off his barber's gown. Ozim yells `kabuka! And Ekrem snarls, flicks open the razor and drags it across Soyka's throat. Soyka's scream bubbles in the blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. KILBURN HIGH ROAD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We dissolve to a Christmas decoration flashing on and off in the rain, high on a lamp post in Kilburn High Road. We pan down the lamp post to the High Road where revelers are hurrying through the rain. We see a young girl (TATIANA) hurrying across the street, wrapped in a dressing gown with a man's overcoat thrown over the top of it. Her hair is soaked as she approaches an all night chemist's shop. She is barefoot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHEMIST'S SHOP - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CHEMIST is delivering advice in Gujurati to a CUSTOMER. Tatiana wipes rain from her face and the Chemist and the customer react to her ragged appearance.

The customer looks at Tatiana's feet and reacts. We see blood trickling down her legs. Tatiana looks down, then faints onto the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. OPERATING WARD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see Tatiana unconscious on a wheeled trolley bursting through double doors into the operating ward of Trafalgar hospital. The trolley is accompanied by TWO NURSES, a JUNIOR DOCTOR and a midwife, (ANNA KHITROVA). The two PARAMEDICS who brought her are following behind the trolley.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>

INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. OPERATING THEATER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A tiny brown handbag is being shaken empty by a nurse. Tatiana is being prepared for an emergency Caesarean. The theater is full of people in scrubs, including an anesthetist. Monitors and drips are being attached at double speed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We notice that her arms are already dotted with festering needle marks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A nurse searches through the contents of the handbag and we can hear frantic activity from the operating table....
</DIRECTION>
<NURSE_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Her stats are very poor, very poor. Baby's very distressed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NURSE_1>
<DIRECTION>
Anna approaches the nurse, who is rummaging through the contents of the bag. We see a business card from a restaurant called `The Trans-Siberian', a St. Christopher necklace and a tiny battered diary. Anna grabs the diary.
</DIRECTION>
<JUNIOR_DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shoulder distocia, I think. Stuck on the pubic bone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNIOR_DOCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Cut to Anna at Tatiana's head. Anna strokes her face and speaks softly.

	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNIOR_DOCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
THE JUNIOR DOCTOR is breathing hard with a look of utter panic as he attempts to free the baby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The doors burst open and a more senior doctor in his mid thirties (DOCTOR AZIZ) enters at a gallop. As he enters...
</DIRECTION>
<NURSE_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Baby stats sixty-eight and in free fall.

</DIRECTION>
<AZIZ>

	Speak to me...

Before the junior doctor can speak Anna speaks directly to Aziz.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>

	<DIALOGUE>
	We need to get the baby out now.

Aziz knows he can take Anna's word...
</DIRECTION>
<AZIZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OK, let's go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AZIZ>
<DIRECTION>
All hell is let loose. As the Caesarean process begins at frantic speed, we slowly zoom in on Tatiana's unconscious face and hear her voice in V.O... a young girl's voice speaking with an Russian accent. The crosstalk between nurses and doctors becomes more and more frantic.
</DIRECTION>
<TATIANA>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My name is Tatiana. My father died in the mines in my village, so he was already buried when he died. We were all buried there. Buried under the soil of Russia. That is why I left to find a better life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TATIANA>
<DIRECTION>
We hear... a baby cry. Anna's face appears in our framed shot of Tatiana's face. She gently kisses Tatiana's cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
(whispers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You had a girl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
A sheet is pulled over Tatiana's face. A nurse weighs the screaming baby. Anna wipes her brow with the back of her bloody wrist.
</DIRECTION>
<AZIZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ok. Call it.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
The Junior doctor and a nurse check watches and speak almost in unison...

They look at each other and giggle. They both have potato peelers in their wet hands, sleeves rolled up, two practical unsentimental women being almost consumed by the same wave of emotion.

EXT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT. SIDE ENTRANCE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The side door opens to reveal a hard-looking, handsome Russian man (NIKOLAI), who stops to groom his hair back from his face and put on a pair of sunglasses as he emerges into daylight. He steps into a small courtyard, where a fierce Doberman dog is barking and snarling on the end of a chain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nikolai is followed by KIRILL, who is a little younger, slim and pretty but hard-looking too. Kirill is dressed in a crumpled T-shirt and jeans and looks like he had a heavy night. Nikolai ignores the dog as he walks by but Kirill yells at it and teases it with a whoop and few Russian curses. Nikolai unbolts the gate to the street.

	So you pick up Ozim and his bitch of a wife and you bring them back here.

Kirill grabs Nikolai's face to distract him, gives him a playful slap, but there is somehow more to it than playfulness. Nikolai gets into his car.

Kirill glares at Anna as she approaches the front of the restaurant.

As Nikolai drives away, Anna rings the doorbell beside the front door. There is no reply. She is about to ring again when the door opens. We see SEMYON, a Russian man in his late sixties.

Inside the kitchen there is an inferno of activity, steam, smoke. Family members, some dressed in their party outfits, others in chefs' uniforms, are standing over steaming pots, laughing, arguing. Children play and yell. You can almost smell Christmas. Anna enters, dazzled by it all, overwhelmed by the contrast to her own lifeless Christmas kitchen. Semyon calls out to everyone.

EXT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nikolai's black Mercedes pulls up outside the restaurant and parks a few inches from Anna's motorbike. The rear windows are sun shaded so we only see Nikolai in the driver's seat. He gets out of the car and opens the rear door of the car for an elegantly dressed Turkish lady in her fifties. Nikolai goes to the other rear door. The portly figure of Ozim the barber emerges. As Ozim gets out he gives Nikolai a fifty-pound note.

INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT. KITCHEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two of the little girl violinists are fighting, pulling each other's hair. The third is sobbing, sitting on the floor. A young woman in a party dress is carrying a huge silver bowl of sauce across the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna looks delighted at the noise and energy of the place. Finally Semyon emerges from a cloud of steam with a scrap of paper.
</DIRECTION>
<SEMYON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is an agency that hires casual kitchen staff. Maybe you will have more luck there. But I think they will be closed until New Year.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEMYON>

As Anna takes the address, Kirill puts his head around the door and yells through the noise.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Papa, Ozim is here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRILL>
<DIRECTION>
Semyon is alarmed and claps his hand in urgent fashion.

<SEMYON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ten minutes!!

(to the rest of the kitchen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fish, fish, fish! Ten minutes! OK, Kirill, get him a drink and tell him I am coming.

Semyon takes a pot from the heat, suddenly flustered.

<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anna, I'm so sorry I couldn't help. It is sad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEMYON>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's OK. I'll probably find out more when I get her diary translated.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<SEMYON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Her diary?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEMYON>
<DIRECTION>
There is the tiniest of changes in Semyon's manner. He lays his heavy pot down.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I found her diary in her bag.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
A pause. Semyon disappears into a billow of steam to put a pan onto the heat then re-emerges.
</DIRECTION>
<SEMYON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why did you not tell me you found a diary?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEMYON>
<DIRECTION>
He peers at her for a moment, his eyes hardening a little.
</DIRECTION>
<SEMYON>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OK, Anna, this is how it will be. You will bring the diary here and I will translate it for you. Then if we get the names of any relatives I will call them myself. I am something of a... community leader for the Russians here in this unfriendly city. What do you say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEMYON>

Semyon hoists a passing child into his arms.

INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kirill and Ozim are talking confidentially in a mix of Russian and Turkish whispers at a table. Ozim's wife is at a table alone, well out of their earshot, smoking a cigarette and peeling glazed figs. As Anna walks by, Ozim and Kirill stop talking. The scene has a much darker mood to the bustling scene in the kitchen, but for now Anna feels no unease. As she passes, Kirill surveys her with a deadly smile and a professional eye.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, you OK? You want a drink?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRILL>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, thanks. I'm driving.

Ozim giggles. Anna departs.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna emerges into the daylight. As she does she sees that four expensive-looking cars have already parked and various ostentatiously dressed Russian and Turkish couples with their children are emerging from their cars. The women are all wearing furs, even the little girls. The men wear leather or dark suits. They greet each other exuberantly as they emerge from their cars. Anna suddenly feels slightly uneasy. As she approaches her motorbike she sees Nikolai leaning against the bonnet of his car, smoking, still wearing shades. His bumper is almost touching Anna's bike.

</ANNA>
<NIKOLAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How much do you want for it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKOLAI>
<DIRECTION>
Anna has already taken a dislike to this man. He is arrogant and looks potentially violent. His shades, suit and tattoos say it all.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
(irritated)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It has sentimental value.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
Nikolai rolls the concept around in his mind and considers.

<NIKOLAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	`Sentimental value'. I've heard of that.

	It's Christmas. Everything's closed.

<NIKOLAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sometimes if things are closed you just open them up, you know?

Anna now feels intimidated and luckily the bike fires first time. She rides away. Nikolai watches her go and then stubs his cigarette.

INT. HELEN'S HOUSE. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Sudden silence... perhaps the ticking of a clock. This is Anna's Christmas dinner, a total contrast to the chaos of the restaurant. Stepan is attempting to carve the chicken.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anna, how come is it that your boyfriend isn't here to carve?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPAN>

Stepan takes a large sip of vodka.

The garden is just outside the kitchen.

Anna is lighting a cigarette. Helen steps outside and reacts to the cigarette. She is about to admonish Anna for smoking, but Anna speaks first.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's Christmas. I'm thirty-one.
	</DIALOGUE>

	Anna, you know what he's like.

	Then it's up to the proper authorities.

<ANNA>

	The proper authorities will all be skiing until after New Year.

Anna coughs a little then stubs her cigarette. Helen takes the butt as if it were poisonous.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's part of the grieving.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What grieving?

Helen touches her hand. An inadequate gesture.

<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In the last year you've lost your father and you lost a baby.

Anna is irritated but doesn't put words to her feelings.

<DIRECTION>
INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. S.C.B.U. CHRISTINE'S PRIVATE ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a private room in the Special Care Baby Unit, Anna approaches Tatiana's baby's plastic crib. The baby is tightly bundled up, sound asleep. Through the windows of the room, we see the darkened, quiet ward outside - another world.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna stands over the baby, her face full of emotion. There we see pain, loss, shame, emptiness, isolation. Tears begin to roll from her eyes, and then she is sobbing soundlessly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Trans-Siberian restaurant is smoky with cigarettes and cigars. The party is in full swing with two dozen guests and family. One of the golden-haired children is playing violin badly. The language is Russian, English and Turkish mixed. Kirill is bringing a huge baked carp to the table. His mobile phone rings and he wipes his hands on a towel to answer it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When he hears the voice, Kirill glances at his father and moves quickly out of earshot. Semyon notices but hides his concern. As Kirill walks, a child tugs his leg and holds up a soft toy, asking a question in Russian.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRILL>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's called Goofy... Goofy yeah.

	So the coast is clear, yeah? What? I said `coast'.

(hissing out of ear shot)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...there are no police. You sure? Good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRILL>
<DIRECTION>
Kirill glances over at Semyon, who is apparently lost amongst a sea of children, but we see from the corner of his eye he is watching Kirill.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRILL>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (to phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, my dad's not involved. I'm a big boy now. I do my own stuff. Yeah. Merry Christmas.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRILL>
<DIRECTION>
Kirill cuts the call and nods to Ozim, who stubs his cigar. Semyon notices their silent communication, then turns to one of the violin-playing angels, smiles, and kisses her on both cheeks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OZIM'S BARBER SHOP - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see the car pull up sharply outside Ozim's barber's shop. Nikolai jumps out and opens the door for Ozim.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The three men walk to the door beside the barber shop. Ozim takes a bunch of keys out and prepares to open the door to the upstairs. He stops.
</DIRECTION>
<OZIM>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OZIM'S BARBER SHOP. UPSTAIRS ROOMS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rooms above Ozim's shop have been converted into a drinking club. Ozim leads Nikolai and Kirill through the debris of the night before. As they walk through, Ekrem suddenly leaps out of the darkness with a yell. Kirill and Nikolai both react with instinctive aggression.
</DIRECTION>
<OZIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, hey, hey Ekrem, sakim, durgun, durgun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OZIM>
<EKREM>

	<DIALOGUE>
	OK, OK, OK. You go and watch a DVD, yeah?

Ekrem nods and hugs Ozim. We realize he is slightly deranged. Finally he lets Ozim go and leaves. Kirill watches him go.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He knows to say he hasn't seen us, right Ozim?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRILL>

Ozim opens the kitchen door.

Inside the kitchen there are carcasses of lambs hanging from meat hooks. There are knives and skewers around the place. Ozim stops and locks the kitchen door behind them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OZIM'S BARBER SHOP. KITCHEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The freezer door opens and Ozim gestures towards a large package bound up in black bin liners which are dusted with frost. Kirill nods to Nikolai who grabs the package and hauls it out onto the kitchen floor. Kirill tears a hole in the bin liner and we see the frost-dusted face of Soyka.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kirill studies the face and nods.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRILL>

	That's him.

Kirill reaches into his pocket and produces an envelope which he hands to Ozim. As Ozim opens the envelope and begins to count the huge wad of cash, Kirill turns to Nikolai.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRILL>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OK, Nikolai, he's all yours. And show some respect. This Muslim is scared of ghosts.

Nikolai squeezes the body inside the bags. It is rock hard.

<NIKOLAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you got a hair dryer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKOLAI>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OZIM'S BARBER SHOP. KITCHEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We cut close to an ancient-looking hair dryer from the shop downstairs being trained onto a human hand with a large eagle tattoo. We pull wide to reveal the full, gruesome scene.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nikolai has the body of Soyka laid out on a surface, his head still bound up in a bin bag, his lower portions bound up similarly. Nikolai is de-frosting Soyka's left hand with the hair dryer, concentrating on his ring finger which has a gold ring on it. The parts of Soyka's shirt and jacket which are visible are crusted with frozen blood. Nikolai is wearing rubber gloves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he dries, Nikolai takes a sip of coffee. Ozim is watching this scene with horror. Kirill has his arms folded, mightily impressed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally the hand is thawed enough for Nikolai to remove the gold ring. He studies an inscription and then offers it to Ozim. Ozim shakes his head as if the thing were a contagion. Nikolai shrugs and pockets it. He then turns the hair dryer back on and blows some hot air onto the crisply bloody chest of Soyka. He tugs at the frozen lapel of the jacket and blows air into the inside pocket. Within a few moments he is able to remove Soyka's glistening, thawing wallet which is caked in frozen blood. He opens it (we glimpse a photo of a wife and children) and blows hot air onto the money inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He tugs a wad of frozen bank notes from the wallet, all stuck together by drops of frozen blood. He offers this money to Ozim as well but Ozim shakes his head vigorously. Kirill hoots with laughter. Ozim is now staring at Nikolai as if he were a devil from hell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nikolai grabs a plastic bag and puts the money inside it, then pockets the frozen wad. He tosses the rest of the frozen wallet to Ozim, who instinctively catches it.
</DIRECTION>
<NIKOLAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'd better burn that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKOLAI>
<DIRECTION>
Ozim, reacting to the cold of the wallet and to the horror of it, drops the thing on the floor. Nikolai looks at Ozim as if he were a complete amateur.

Kirill leaves. Nikolai is left alone. His hand shakes a little as he picks up his cup of coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NINE ELMS. ABANDONED DOCK - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nikolai pulls up beside a rusting crane on the abandoned dock in a dry-cleaner's van. Kirill watches as Nikolai grabs the semi-thawed body, now bagged and tied, lifts it onto his shoulder, and smartly approaches the dockside.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aren't you going to weight him down or something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRILL>
<DIRECTION>
Nikolai drops the body into the water with a splash.
</DIRECTION>
<NIKOLAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you want to dump a body, this is the place. The currents keep it under the surface until past the barrier.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKOLAI>

Nikolai and Kirill watch as the body is swallowed by a fast ocean-bound current.

<DIRECTION>
Semyon is unlocking the door and discovering, in the drizzle and half light, that it is Anna.
</DIRECTION>
<SEMYON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah. My dear! I wasn't expecting you so early.
	</DIALOGUE>

<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it OK?

INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Semyon and Anna are sitting down at the candlelit table. Anna fumbles in her bag and produces a sheaf of photocopied sheets. She has photocopied the pages of the diary and they are laid out in segments on each page.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I copied the whole thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
Semyon takes the pages and looks troubled.
</DIRECTION>
<SEMYON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is the original?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEMYON>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to keep it. Maybe give it to Tatiana's daughter someday.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
Semyon looks thwarted but hides it well. He studies the photocopied sheets for a while then looks up and smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<SEMYON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will need my spectacles and a clear head. Today I broke my rules and drank vodka. Tomorrow I will translate it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEMYON>
<DIRECTION>
He folds the papers carefully.
</DIRECTION>
<SEMYON>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then I will bring what I have done to your home. Where do you live, Anna?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEMYON>
<DIRECTION>
There is nothing in Semyon's smile to cause alarm but Anna perhaps remembers Nikolai. Finally...
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not far. I can drop by and pick it up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<SEMYON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then maybe I can drive you home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEMYON>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm fine. I'm on my motorbike.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
Semyon stares at her for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<SEMYON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what will happen to the poor child?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEMYON>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	After Christmas, they'll do a missing persons report.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<SEMYON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who will?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEMYON>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The police.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
Semyon doesn't blink. At that moment a little girl of seven (MARIA) emerges from the darkness, carrying a soft toy.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grandpa.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIA>
<SEMYON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, hey, Maria, go back to bed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEMYON>
<MARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm too sad. Next Christmas isn't for another hundreds and hundreds of days.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIA>
<DIRECTION>
Semyon takes her onto his knee. As he does, we see, for the first time, an eagle tattoo on his wrist.
</DIRECTION>
<SEMYON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you have had so many presents.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEMYON>
<DIRECTION>
The girl wafts Semyon's cigar smoke.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You shouldn't smoke, Grandpa.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIA>
<SEMYON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEMYON>
<DIRECTION>
Semyon cuddles Maria and stubs his cigar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna smiles at the warm family scene, perhaps remembering her own father.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nikolai gets out of the Mercedes and helps an extremely pissed Kirill out of the car into the rain. Kirill is so drunk he slips through Nikolai's hands and lands in the gutter.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're partners now, man, you know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRILL>
<NIKOLAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, yeah, I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKOLAI>
<DIRECTION>
Nikolai manages to lift him to his feet again. As they head towards the restaurant, Anna emerges. Nikolai looks up, curious, as Semyon kisses her on both cheeks in the doorway. As she turns Kirill stumbles forwards and collapses in front of her. Nikolai looks up at Anna, his face splashed with rain.
</DIRECTION>
<NIKOLAI>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? You never seen anybody pissed before?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKOLAI>
<DIRECTION>
Semyon looks down at the drunken Kirill and slams the door of the restaurant. Nikolai sighs, then turns to Kirill and starts to go through his pockets.
</DIRECTION>
<NIKOLAI>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Kirill. Where are your keys?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKOLAI>
<DIRECTION>
Anna walks around the two of them, watching the undignified struggle as Nikolai finds Kirill's keys. Nikolai smiles at her.
</DIRECTION>
<NIKOLAI>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who are you, anyway?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKOLAI>
<DIRECTION>
Anna hurries away into the rain. Nikolai finds Kirill's keys and drags him toward the door of the restaurant.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nikolai heaves Kirill into a chair. Semyon is back at his novel and watches as Kirill attempts to get to his feet and then stumbles to the floor. He slumps down, now totally unconscious, breathing deeply. Nikolai smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<NIKOLAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We went to a Kurdish place. They don't even celebrate Christmas.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKOLAI>
<DIRECTION>
Semyon steps up to where Kirill is lying and stands over him for a moment. Then he kicks him hard in the guts with all his might. Nikolai is shocked, and grabs Semyon's arm. A hand laid upon him is like deadly poison. Kirill grunts and moans.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Papa, what did I do? This is Merry Christmas or what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRILL>
<DIRECTION>
Semyon kicks him hard in the guts again.
</DIRECTION>
<NIKOLAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think he's had enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKOLAI>
<DIRECTION>
Nikolai steps in between Semyon and Kirill. Semyon is shocked that anyone should face him like this.
</DIRECTION>
<SEMYON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who... the fuck... are you to tell me enough?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEMYON>
<DIRECTION>
Nikolai's face hardens.
</DIRECTION>
<NIKOLAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're partners.

</NIKOLAI>
<DIRECTION>
Nikolai looks down at Kirill.
</DIRECTION>
<NIKOLAI>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	He's thunder, I'm lightning. He makes all the noise, I do all the damage.

</NIKOLAI>
<SEMYON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hired you as a driver...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEMYON>
<DIRECTION>
Semyon bends to roughly hoist Kirill into a chair.
</DIRECTION>
<SEMYON>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...someone to stop him killing himself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEMYON>
<NIKOLAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you got more than a driver.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKOLAI>
<DIRECTION>
Nikolai reaches into his pocket for a business card and offers it to Semyon. As Semyon looks at the card in the candle light, he also sees the TATTOO OF AN EAGLE on Nikolai's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is obvious that the tattoo means more than the card to Semyon, and he reacts.
</DIRECTION>
<NIKOLAI>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I run a mini-cab business. Albanians, Chechens, Russians. They deliver packages. Anything. Anywhere.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you and I could do business together.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKOLAI>
<DIRECTION>
A pause. Semyon looks at Nikolai with utter contempt.
</DIRECTION>
<SEMYON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have no idea what business you're talking about. Now get out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEMYON>
<DIRECTION>
Nikolai smiles and then leaves. Semyon watches him go then peers at his drunken, sleeping son with something approaching compassion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nikolai hurries out to his car in the rain. He hears an engine splutter and spots Anna still trying to kick-start her motorbike. He approaches. She's already soaked. Nikolai watches her try to start the bike and fail.
</DIRECTION>
<NIKOLAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've got water in it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKOLAI>
<DIRECTION>
Deadpan, Anna looks up and holds out her hand into pouring rain.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Water? What makes you think that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
Anna tries to start the bike again. Nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<NIKOLAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The postmen used these. In my village. When I was a boy. Russian copy of BMW flat twin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKOLAI>
<DIRECTION>
Anna tries one more time to start the bike and growls with fury. Nikolai gently takes her shoulders and after a brief resistance Anna climbs off the bike. Nikolai sits astride it. He kicks it. It fails to start. Anna folds her arms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He tries again. And again. He climbs off.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get a bus.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got far to go?
	</DIALOGUE>

Anna tucks her crash helmet under her arm and prepares to set off walking.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just across the park.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<NIKOLAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a driver. I even do limousines. Look...

</NIKOLAI>
<DIRECTION>
Nikolai opens the rear car door.
</DIRECTION>
<NIKOLAI>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If Semyon found out I let one of his guests walk home in the rain, he'd fire me. And I can take care of your bike. So...
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKOLAI>
<DIRECTION>
Nikolai holds open the rear car door. Rain pours.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LONDON STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nikolai is driving Anna through the rain-swept streets. The wipers beat time as they drive in silence. As Nikolai holds the steering wheel, Anna sees the intricate detail of the eagle tattoo on the back of his right hand.
</DIRECTION>
<NIKOLAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you're a midwife. Jesus.

	You get used to it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>

A pause. Nikolai seems vaguely horrified at a memory.
</DIRECTION>
<NIKOLAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't faint, but it was close.

</ANNA>
<NIKOLAI>

	Yeah, I know, I know, it's just... it makes me upset, you know? Thinking about it. This time of year. They're back in Yekaterinburg. In the forests. Near the mountains.

<DIRECTION>
A long pause.

	Left here.

Nikolai turns.

	<DIALOGUE>
	So Semyon employs you?

</ANNA>
<NIKOLAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm... sort of freelance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKOLAI>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You said he'd fire you.

Nikolai doesn't answer. Anna decides she can be bold.

</ANNA>
<NIKOLAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In that case, no, I never heard of her.

Anna doesn't care for the smile on Nikolai's face.

	She died last night on my shift.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Sometimes birth and death go together.

	She had needle punctures all over both arms. Dehydration, emaciation. Early presentation of syphilis. Probably a prostitute. At the age of fourteen.

	You know what? I hate the rain. This time of year. You ever been to Russia at Christmas? Man, snow that covers your whole house.

Nikolai glances at Anna in the rear-view mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<NIKOLAI>
<DIRECTION>

	Oh yeah. And the ice. Whole lakes covered in ice. You don't want to walk across them, though. Ice gets thin where you least expect it.

<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think Semyon's son knew her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>

	Like I said, I'm a driver. I go left, I go right, I go straight ahead. That's it.

Anna nods, her curiosity and suspicions aroused. Nikolai glances at her.

Somewhere within sight of the Thames barrier.

<DIRECTION>
A dozen policemen and forensic investigators are milling round on a shale beach, the icy waters of the Thames lapping at their feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FORENSIC TENT - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A large tent has been erected over the body of Soyka. Inside the tent two senior police officers await the arrival of a third man, a specialist from the Russian desk (YURI), who is not dressed for the weather. He has obviously been dragged out of bed. He is led to the side of the body. One of the officers pulls up the dead man's hand and shows him the eagle tattoo.
</DIRECTION>
<OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We think he might be Russian Mafia.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
Yuri studies the tattoo, then borrows a torch. He crouches to push up the wet trouser leg on the corpse's right leg. When the knee is exposed in torch light we see a small star tattooed on the knee cap.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He is actually a Chechen. He is also a member of the vory v zakone. The stars on the knees mean he would never kneel before anyone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
Yuri opens the dead man's shirt and we see a tattoo of an eight-pointed star on his chest.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>

	In Russian prisons, your life story is written on your body in tattoos. You don't exist without tattoos.

	<DIALOGUE>
	He was a captain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
He then checks out the fingers in the torchlight and we glimpse that the finger tips have been sawn off.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But he has been processed professionally.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
Yuri straightens and grabs a paper towel to wipe his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There was something else. It was... inside the body. Chest cavity.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
The officer holds up a small zip-lock bag which has a handwritten note sealed inside it. The handwriting is just visible through the wet cellophane.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Yuri steps outside the forensic tent. He opens the bag and takes out the note. He unfolds it to read, then smiles to himself.

<DIRECTION>
Stepan explodes.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No Anna! You don't go to someone else with this! You don't go to anyone! Nasilovanie, it means rape. Iglah, it means needle. Prostitutcia, perhaps you can guess.

Stepan hands the diary to Anna and then turns.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are in HARLESDEN, NORTH LONDON.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A large portable stereo is playing rock music.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The curtains are drawn against daylight. The living room is decorated in seventies suburban style, but with the wall paper peeling and the paint work fading. Kitsch paintings still decorate the walls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Six young East-European girls are sitting on a broken-down sofa and on hard-backed chairs, wearing short skirts. Their eyes are sunken and their faces vacant of expression, but they are painted with so much make-up they almost look like tiny, sad clowns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They sit in silence as the music blares out. After a few moments a young Albanian man enters and claps his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<ALBANIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OK, boss is here. Boss, boss. You make him happy...

All the girls apart from one immediately get to their feet and begin to dance to the music, their bodies moving awkwardly and painfully. The Albanian approaches the one girl who refused to stand and yanks her to her feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He slaps her hard and hisses at her in Albanian. She tries to sit down again but he pulls her up and slaps her again. Finally he shoves her into the middle of the room and she begins to dance, sobbing as she does.

Kirill and Nikolai are swigging whisky from the bottle and dancing with the girls. Some of the girls are drinking, too, and managing to laugh. Kirill is dancing maniacally and swinging his girl around faster and faster until she falls over.
</DIRECTION>

Nikolai swigs his drink and notices the girl who refused to stand up. She is standing in the corner, sobbing. Nikolai doesn't care to look at her for more than a second and he goes back to dancing.

Nikolai is fucking the girl, who is now silent. She is on all fours, registering no emotion.

Kirill is leaning against the wall, drinking wine from the bottle, watching Nikolai with burning eyes, his lust and drunken jealousy mixing together. Nikolai grits his teeth and comes inside the girl. Kirill whoops and whistles and begins to applaud.

In the half-lit private room, Anna is dancing with Christine in her arms. She is singing a lullaby softly to her. The door is open to the rest of the ward and all the other babies are silent.
</DIRECTION>

Finally she lays a sleeping Christine back in her crib. She sits down on the bed where the mother should be. She curses herself silently and gets to her feet, determined to pull herself together.
</DIRECTION>

As she starts to leave the private room to enter the ward, she is suddenly confronted by Semyon.

It is Saturday morning and the place is full of families. Christmas decorations are beginning to look ragged.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna and Helen are sitting at a table, terrified but trying hard to stay calm. Stepan arrives with a tray of coffees and a burger. He sits, and Anna and Helen glance uneasily at each other. Stepan begins to eat noisily.

There is a tension that builds until Nikolai's Mercedes suddenly looms into view, filling the street window of the burger bar. Nikolai gets out of his car, all shades and sharp suit.

Stepan removes his hand, empty, his bravado crushed.

Nikolai enters the restaurant and spots Anna. He comes and sits at the table beside Stepan, opposite Anna. It's a tight squeeze. Anna and Helen are stiff with terror. Nikolai smiles.

Nikolai is amused by the three of them. Anna produces Tatiana's diary and hands it to Nikolai. Nikolai studies it and nods. He gets to his feet...

Nikolai has emerged into the busy suburban street and is about to get in to his car. Anna flies at him, yelling.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She was fourteen! Read the diary! She was fourteen when he raped her!

Passers-by stare at Anna. Helen and Stepan have come out of the restaurant to restrain her. Nikolai stops and judges the fury on Anna's face. He speaks calmly.
</DIRECTION>
<NIKOLAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anger is very dangerous. It makes people do stupid things. Forget any of this ever happened. You're in the wrong place, Anna Ivanovna.

He gestures at the burger restaurant.

	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKOLAI>
<DIRECTION>
Anna and Nikolai are staring at each other, suddenly a strange connection between them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then Stepan steps forward and spits in Nikolai's face, delivering a Russian curse as he does so. Nikolai almost reacts out of instinct but stops himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nikolai wipes his face and peers into Anna's eyes. Finally he gets into his car and drives away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Nikolai is alone, sitting at a candlelit table, reading Tatiana's diary. We hear Tatiana in voice-over...
</DIRECTION>
<TATIANA>

</DIRECTION>

	I am not sure I can carry on another day. The windows won't open so I can't throw myself out. They inject me every day with heroin. Sometimes I think this is all a hallucination...

</TATIANA>
<DIRECTION>
He sees Semyon approaching from the kitchen and closes the diary. Semyon grabs a bottle of vodka from the bar on his way to sit opposite Nikolai. Nikolai pushes the diary across the table. Semyon pours two drinks.

<NIKOLAI>

	That he is a drunk. And that he is also... a queer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKOLAI>
<DIRECTION>
Semyon swigs his vodka and Nikolai swigs his. Semyon pours two more. Semyon has to stare out of the window to hide his emotion.

Semyon peers at Nikolai and Nikolai doesn't respond. Mention of the new breed of FSB agent causes an almost imperceptible tension in Nikolai.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Is Semyon too drunk to notice? There is a strange game going on here. For now, nothing is revealed.
</DIRECTION>

Semyon knocks back his vodka and Nikolai does the same. Semyon picks up the diary and holds it into the flame of the candle. It begins to burn and he drops it into the ashtray. The flames flicker for a while.

Crowds of football supporters are streaming away from the football stadium, where the floodlights are still casting their glow. There are Arsenal and Chelsea supporters on opposite sides of the street and there is some mildly vicious yelling between the two groups. Police are visibly keeping order.
</DIRECTION>

Among the crowd we see Ekrem. He seems slightly drunk on top of his normal craziness. He has an Arsenal scarf around his neck and is looking for trouble, jeering at the Chelsea supporters across the street.

Ekrem is now isolated from the crowds, swigging from a can of lager. He is chanting `Arsenal, Arsenal' to himself as he walks. He stops to take a piss on someone's grave.

In the background the two Chechens are coming closer. As Ekrem zips his flies, the Chechens are upon him. One of them grabs his Arsenal scarf and begins to strangle him.

Ekrem chokes for a while and the Chechen loosens the knot. The second Chechen pulls out an open razor. Ekrem struggles to escape...

<DIRECTION>
Anna is reading the translation of the diary by lamplight. Tatiana's voice over continues.
</DIRECTION>
<TATIANA>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know now for sure that I am pregnant. It hasn't begun to show yet. After I was raped they made me take pills but I guess it was too late. I am condemned to give birth to a new life. But first I will try to find a way to end my own life and spare this child the pain.

Anna looks up from the pages and thinks.

EXT. HOUSING ESTATE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A large public housing estate is being swept by rain. Christmas lights glow in the windows of the dilapidated tower blocks. Stepan is walking against the wind, carrying a bag of shopping. He holds onto his Russian hat to stop it blowing away. Kids splash in the puddles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stepan arrives at the front garden of his small, ground- floor council flat. As he fumbles for his keys in the cold we see that Nikolai is watching him from the driver's seat of his Mercedes. Once Stepan has disappeared into his flat, Nikolai gets out of the car and approaches Stepan's flat.

INT. HELEN'S HOUSE. KITCHEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Helen is preparing food for a small family dinner. Anna enters with her cellphone in her hand. She mooches for food to hide her agenda. Finally...

<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>

<ANNA>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It matters... to me!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
A pause. After a moment Helen goes to her, holds her hands and peers into her eyes. We expect comforting words, but instead...
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You enjoy this.

</HELEN>

EXT. LONDON STREETS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna drives her motorbike through North London streets. Rain is falling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna is standing in the falling rain, staring over at the trans-Siberian restaurant. The restaurant is busy, with the noise of revelers swelling every time the door is opened.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna seems to be exiled from where she should really be -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside a restaurant like this, with its danger and vibrancy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly she is illuminated by headlights. She turns and sees that Nikolai is pulling up in his Mercedes. Kirill is in the passenger seat. Nikolai gets out of the car and stops when he sees Anna. Anna is like a fox caught in headlights.
</DIRECTION>
<NIKOLAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing here?

<DIRECTION>
A pause.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

Kirill studies the gaze between Nikolai and Anna and senses the connection.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you're passing, you pass. You keep going, bitch. Nikolai, come on...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRILL>
<DIRECTION>
Kirill grabs Nikolai's arm, and after peering at Anna for a moment, he turns to go with Kirill. Anna gathers her courage.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Family is important to you people isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<KIRILL>

<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell Semyon the baby I delivered on Christmas Eve is his daughter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
Kirill and Nikolai stop. A swell of laughter from the restaurant. Anna is about to continue but Nikolai steps forward and places two fingers on Anna's lips to stop her from saying anymore. Anna tears his hands from her mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the same time Kirill yells in Russian.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRILL>
<DIRECTION>
(in Russian)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did she say?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRILL>
<DIRECTION>
Anna is terrified but angry too. She yells.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When he raped her she was a virgin. Then they gave her pills. Semyon has to be the father!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
Kirill suddenly goes for her over the bonnet of the car....

Kirill slaps Anna hard. Nikolai grabs Kirill and pulls him away.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't use my father's name! You don't say that filth about him...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRILL>
<DIRECTION>
He goes for Anna again, and this time Nikolai shoves Kirill to the wet ground. He looks up at Nikolai and slowly gets to his feet. He wipes his hands then stares into Nikolai's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRILL>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't even look at her any more.

Nikolai peers at Anna for a moment. Anna's voice is defiant but cracking with fear.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell him what I said.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
Nikolai has taken what Anna said on board. He speaks softly...
</DIRECTION>
<NIKOLAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is nothing to tell. Slaves give birth to slaves...
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKOLAI>

Kirill yells....

<DIRECTION>
INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The place is winding up. Chefs and waiters are cleaning surfaces and dishes. The only still point is Semyon, who is cutting and wrapping the birthday cake in small parcels of golden paper. He works intensely and delicately at the back of the kitchen. Nikolai and Kirill enter. Kirill swigs a half-drunk glass of wine.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRILL>

<KIRILL>

	So they kick down the door. These are ordinary fucking police. They ask for her by name and they take her away. Some fucking punter must have given them her name. What gives the police the right to take our women, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRILL>

Semyon shoots Kirill a hard look: he's talking too much and too loudly. Kirill ignores the look.

</KIRILL>
<SEMYON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. He stays here. I want to talk business.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEMYON>
<DIRECTION>
A confused pause. Kirill looks from Nikolai to his father.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What business?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRILL>
<DIRECTION>
A pause as Kirill suddenly senses his exclusion.

</DIRECTION>
<SEMYON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go to the cellar Kirill. And take your time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEMYON>
<DIRECTION>
Kirill hesitates. He is angry as hell but too scared of his father's gaze to say anything. Finally he turns fast and departs, slamming his open hand against the door as he goes.

Semyon waits a moment before returning to the business of cutting the cake. Finally...

<DIRECTION>
INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT. CELLAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cellar is half lit, the arched walls lined with crates of wine. Flour, grease and potatoes are stored here. As Nikolai walks down the steps into the gloom, he hears Kirill singing a Russian folk song to himself as he drags a case of brandy across the cellar floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kirill has already opened a bottle of brandy and takes a long swig as Nikolai joins him. He grins as he gestures at the brandy...
</DIRECTION>
<KIRILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My dad swapped a little Georgian girl for this stuff.
	</DIALOGUE>

Nikolai sits down on a crate, rests his head against the wall. Kirill joins him and swigs some more.

Kirill offers the bottle to Nikolai but he refuses.

</DIRECTION>
<NIKOLAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He offered me stars. I accepted them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKOLAI>
<DIRECTION>
A long pause. This is what Kirill wanted, but now it feels like a stab in the back. Finally Kirill swallows a huge swig of brandy then turns awkwardly to hug Nikolai. He squeezes him hard for a long time then shoves him away.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRILL>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think I didn't know already? He told me before. It was my fucking idea. He said there are a lot of things I have to teach you.

Nikolai heads for the steps.

Nikolai climbs the steps. Kirill is left to swig his brandy and stare into the darkness. He wipes his eyes angrily with his sleeve.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT. TWO DAYS LATER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sweet Russian choral music covers the next four scenes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The street outside the restaurant is now flooding with rain. A Daimler and a Bentley are already parked. A large SUV pulls up and a hard-looking Russian man in his sixties (VALERY) is ushered from the car by bodyguards in suits and shades.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is greeted by a darker-looking man in his fifties (THE GYPSY) who has a fur coat around his shoulders. Semyon is waiting on the doorstep, dressed in a fine dark suit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The curtains are drawn against the rainy light. The Gypsy, Valery, Semyon and TWO OTHER RUSSIAN MEN are sitting in a line behind a restaurant table, like a judging panel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a moment Nikolai enters, dressed in suit and tie for the biggest interview of his life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The vory behind the table greet him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then Nikolai takes off his jacket and removes his tie. He then takes off his shirt, to reveal that his upper body is decorated with elaborate tattoos (details to follow).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He carefully places his shirt over the chair then sits down. The panel of the vory study his body, the Gypsy pushing a candle across the table to better illuminate the detail of the tattoos. Only after the men have studied the tattoos does the interview begin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The following dialogue should not be translated, and can be cut around to suggest a long and grueling interview.
</DIRECTION>
<VALERY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can see that you were in prison in Siberia. And that you were a thief.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALERY>
<NIKOLAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My father was a government worker. He fixed the cars of officials. I began by selling the spare parts when I was fifteen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKOLAI>
<VALERY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have no forced tattoos?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALERY>
<NIKOLAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	None.

</NIKOLAI>
<GYPSY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were not co-operative?

</GYPSY>
<NIKOLAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I spent two years in the punishment block.

</NIKOLAI>
<VALERY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You went through the Crosses in St. Petersburg?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALERY>
<NIKOLAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was in solitary confinement fifteen times. I was called 'The Stump' because they couldn't shift me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKOLAI>
<VALERY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your father was a bitch and a weak fucker for working with the Government, that's right isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALERY>
<DIRECTION>
Nikolai flickers a little.
</DIRECTION>
<NIKOLAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right. My father means nothing to me. My Mother....
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKOLAI>
<GYPSY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have no mother. She was a whore anyway.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GYPSY>
<NIKOLAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. I have no mother and no father. There is only the code, the vory v zakone code which I have always followed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKOLAI>
<VALERY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That is why there is an empty place above your heart. Where the stars will go. And why there is an empty place on your knees.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALERY>
<NIKOLAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am dead already. I died when I was fifteen. Now I live in the zone all the time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKOLAI>
<GYPSY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have never worked for the government? Any government?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GYPSY>
<NIKOLAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have lived off Albanians and Georgians. I steal from them within the law.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKOLAI>
<DIRECTION>
The questions and answers are delivered with great solemnity, making the ceremony feel almost religious. Candles burn, the men all sip water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Semyon is silent throughout but listens attentively. Towards the end of the interview there is the ghost of a smile on the Gypsy's face and this pleases Semyon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT. REAR ENTRANCE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A wizened old Russian man (THE TATTOOIST) arrives at the kitchen door, carrying a battered leather case. The kitchen door is opened as he arrives and Semyon greets him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The choral music continues as we see the old man opening his case and pulling out tattooing equipment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nikolai is sitting in a banquette at the back, wearing only his underpants. We circle Nikolai as the tattooist begins to work on his knees, preparing Nikolai's knee caps for the tattoos.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The needle bites at Nikolai's skin as the old tattooist wipes away the blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then we see the needle working on the empty spaces above Nikolai's heart, tattooing the star symbol.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nikolai now has a star tattoo on each knee and two eight- pointed stars on his chest. He is now a member of the vory v zakone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HELEN'S HOUSE. ANNA'S BEDROOM - MORNING

EXT. TURKISH BATHS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are in St. Pancras, North London.
</DIRECTION>

More rain. Ozim is waiting nervously, blowing into his hands against the cold. The Turkish bath building is a Victorian red-brick edifice.

<DIRECTION>
Nikolai pulls up in his Mercedes.
</DIRECTION>

INT. TURKISH BATHS. CHANGING ROOM - DAY

Ozim and Nikolai are undressing. The place is deserted apart from an OLD TURKISH BATH-HOUSE ATTENDANT who is distributing towels. Ozim is unbuttoning his shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<OZIM>

	Semyon recommends these places for business meetings because you can see what tattoos a man has.

INT. TURKISH BATHS. CHANGING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ozim is dressing frantically, his face suddenly betraying his real anxiety. He checks his watch as he puts it back on his wrist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a moment the two Chechen brothers who killed Ekrem enter the changing room. They swagger up to Ozim.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He gulps down his fear.
</DIRECTION>
<OZIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kirill is in there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OZIM>
<DIRECTION>
Ozim slaps his chest to denote the place where they will see the vor tattoo. They head towards the steam room as Ozim grabs his shoes and hurries towards the exit.

INT. TURKISH BATHS. STEAM ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nikolai is sweating hard, staring at the ceiling. The steam room door opens but the steam is now so thick he can't see who has entered.
</DIRECTION>
<NIKOLAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ozim?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKOLAI>
<DIRECTION>
He sees a shape... a clothed body. He realizes immediately. Suddenly one of the brothers is upon him and has him in a head lock. He strokes the tattoo on Nikolai's chest as if this were confirmation of who this is. He grunts an instruction and his brother emerges through the steam with an open razor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nikolai is naked, alone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly he kicks the razor guy in the balls and uses a martial arts chop to free himself from the other brother. In the steam there are boots and bare feet and knees and fingers flying. Nikolai manages to gouge the eye of one brother and throw another against the wall. He obviously has serious combat training but the brothers are strong and angry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Nikolai is slashed across the arm by the razor and blood oozes into the steam and hot water. All the men are slipping and falling on the blood and hot water. Another slash of the razor cuts his thigh open. All the men are now covered in blood and Nikolai, with a final surge of strength, manages to cripple one brother with a blow to the throat, and the other with an elbow to the temple.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the Chechens slump to the floor, Nikolai fumbles in the bloody water for the razor, finds it, kneels, and slashes their throats. He lurches to his feet, drops the razor, and staggers out of the steam room.

Nikolai is being hurried down the corridor, his face covered with an oxygen mask. He is covered with a surgical gown which is covered in blood. His arm flops out from under the covers as the paramedics rush him into the hospital.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna is walking in the opposite direction. Then, as Nikolai's trolley passes, Anna sees Nikolai's arm, flopping from under the covers. She sees the eagle tattoo on the back of his hand. Anna freezes.

Nikolai is conscious in bed, attached to a single drip. His wounds have been stitched up.

Anna glances at Nikolai who is rousing himself.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>

The nurse is reluctant but sees Anna's fierce stare and finally leaves. After she has gone Nikolai stirs, focuses on her face.
</DIRECTION>
<NIKOLAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you did birth.

Nikolai smiles, but Anna is trying hard to even out her fear and anger.

Nikolai shrugs.

<KIRILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. It's not a fight if one of you doesn't fight back.

A pause. Kirill smiles. We see slight abrasions.

	<DIALOGUE>
	So, today I do as I am told.
	</DIALOGUE>

She nods and Kirill blows another balloon. At that moment Kirill sees on the security monitor behind the bar that a police car is pulling up outside the restaurant. His face clouds as another pulls up beside it.

INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Semyon sits at a bare table, opposite Yuri from the Russian desk. A uniformed officer stands nearby, and there is a police doctor with a medical bag sitting at the next table, waiting. The whole scene is rendered surreal by all the balloons which bounce around them. Semyon is in full charming old man mode.

	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll have a drink, Yuri...

	<DIALOGUE>
	Then have half a drink.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEMYON>
<DIRECTION>
Yuri shakes his head. Semyon goes to the optic and helps himself to a vodka.
</DIRECTION>
<SEMYON>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what is all this nonsense?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEMYON>
<YURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We just need a blood sample.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<SEMYON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEMYON>
<YURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can take the sample right now voluntarily or I can get an order from the court. It's up to you.

Semyon glances at the doctor and chuckles.

	<DIALOGUE>
	What, you are afraid of needles, Semyon?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
Semyon's face hardens and he glares at Yuri.
</DIRECTION>
<SEMYON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am afraid of... conspiracies.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEMYON>
<DIRECTION>
A pause. Yuri speaks softly.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will return tomorrow with a court order.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
He gets to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<SEMYON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait. I've done nothing wrong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEMYON>
<DIRECTION>
Semyon begins to roll up his sleeve, revealing a long scroll of tattoos.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then a needle is being pushed into Semyon's arm by the doctor. Semyon's face doesn't flicker. He stares into Yuri's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT. KITCHEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kirill is preparing food for the night's festivities. Semyon enters and goes straight to the sink. He pulls off the plaster from his arm where the blood was taken and pours some vodka over the tiny puncture hole.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did they want with you, papa?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRILL>
<SEMYON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To poison me.

Semyon pours more vodka on the wound then takes a swig.
</DIRECTION>
<SEMYON>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They took blood from me with a needle. Probably the same needle they use for all the junkies and whores and blacks and queers.

He glares at Kirill as he rolls his sleeve down.
</DIRECTION>
<SEMYON>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now I probably have the fucking queer disease.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEMYON>
<DIRECTION>
Kirill has his back turned, doesn't react. Semyon sits heavily. Finally...
</DIRECTION>
<KIRILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why would they want your blood, papa?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRILL>
<DIRECTION>
For the first time Semyon looks vulnerable and confused as he admits....
</DIRECTION>
<SEMYON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEMYON>
<DIRECTION>
Kirill is surprised to see his father unsure. He peers at him.
</DIRECTION>
<SEMYON>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Someone is ahead of me. I don't like people ahead of me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEMYON>
<DIRECTION>
Kirill is now unnerved by Semyon's quiet confusion. He watches as Semyon grabs at the bottle of vodka to drink. He speaks softly as he swigs.
</DIRECTION>
<SEMYON>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell did that cocksucker want with my blood?
	</DIALOGUE>

Kirill is reluctant to speak at first but eventually chances his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe it's about the baby.

</KIRILL>
<SEMYON>
<DIRECTION>
(swigging)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What baby?
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
A pause.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some bitch was out there saying you were the father of a baby.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRILL>
<DIRECTION>
Semyon turns to Kirill, his face hardening...
</DIRECTION>
<SEMYON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you talking about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEMYON>
<DIRECTION>
Semyon approaches and Kirill gets scared.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was nothing. Just some bitch...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRILL>
<SEMYON>
	<DIALOGUE>

<KIRILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The woman from the hospital. The midwife.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRILL>
<DIRECTION>
Semyon stares into Kirill's eyes and Kirill mistakes his frantic thought process for anger. Kirill backs away. Semyon is beginning to catch up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The main entrance of the hospital is busy with visitors and staff. There is a `Happy New Year' banner across the entrance. In amongst the bustle of visitors we spy a young man with his collar turned up and a bunch of red roses in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We then see that it is Kirill, entering the hospital.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Anna is walking down a corridor with her crash helmet in her hand, heading for another shift.

<DIRECTION>
INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. ELEVATORS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are close on Kirill's face as he studies a map of the hospital near the elevators.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna comes down a stairwell and spots Kirill - she especially notices the roses - just as he gets into an elevator. The elevator doors close. Was it really him? Anna is not sure. She frowns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. EMPTY CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A door opens and Kirill steps into striped moonlight. Clamping the roses under his arm, he pulls a black zip-up sports bag from under his coat. After a brief dialogue with himself, he produces a half bottle of vodka and takes a swig. Then he hurries on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. S.C.B.U. CHRISTINE'S PRIVATE ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna walks onto the ward in her uniform. She checks a few stats as she walks by various beds. She then glances over at Christine's private room. She tiptoes into the room and goes to the crib. She finds it empty - except for a bunch of red roses. Outside the ward is now filling up with visitors. Babies cry, people laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna goes back out to the ward and calls to a nurse.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sonya! Is someone bathing Christine?

EXT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. CAR PARK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kirill is at the wheel of Nikolai's Mercedes. He swigs from his bottle of vodka, which is now more than half empty. He fires the engine and reverses. A car passing by has to slam on its brakes. Kirill yells.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, you stupid fucker!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRILL>
<DIRECTION>
A horn blows. The passing car accelerates angrily by. Then we hear a baby crying. Kirill looks into the half darkness of the back seat and we see Kirill's black sports bag, partially zipped up. Christine is crying inside it, her little grasping hand protruding past the zipper. Kirill speaks softly.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRILL>

She pushes past a couple of drunks and flies at him.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>

</DIRECTION>
<NIKOLAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you talking about?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKOLAI>
<DIRECTION>
Anna studies Nikolai's face and sees his genuine confusion. She calms down a little.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kirill. Kirill has taken Christine. I saw him here! I thought he was coming to see you, but he wasn't, was he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>

</NIKOLAI>

EXT. NINE ELMS. ABANDONED DOCK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

The same dockside where Nikolai dumped Soyka and recommended this as the best place to dispose of a body. Kirill pulls up slowly in Nikolai's Mercedes. The car is parked for a long time before finally the headlights are switched off.

EXT. NINE ELMS. ABANDONED DOCK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the edge of the dockside, Kirill is kneeling with the zip-up bag before him. Suddenly fireworks begin to burst over the Thames. It is the stroke of midnight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kirill unzips the bag. When he looks inside Christine stops crying. He peers at her, wiping away tears.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's a little girl, Papa, a little sweet fucking girl...

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shush, shush...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRILL>
<DIRECTION>
Kirill lifts her out of the bag and holds her close to him, fireworks still illuminating the London skyline. He looks down at the freezing cold water, utterly confused. He whispers...
</DIRECTION>
<KIRILL>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (in Russian)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, my little sister.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRILL>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment we believe he is going to throw her into the water. Instead he begins to sing a lullaby to her and her crying stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then we see a single light behind him. In a firework flash we see Nikolai and Anna climbing off the bike. They approach cautiously. Kirill stares at the man he loves. A pause. Christine begins to cry.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kirill, let me take the baby.

</ANNA>
<KIRILL>

<ANNA>

</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
Kirill suddenly screams as another barrage of fireworks explodes. Nikolai doesn't move. Kirill is dangerously close to the edge of the dock. Maybe he'll throw himself in too.
</DIRECTION>
<NIKOLAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kirill, a vor doesn't kill little babies.

Kirill is motionless.

</NIKOLAI>
<DIRECTION>
Nikolai steps forward slowly. As he gets closer Kirill hugs the baby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally Nikolai reaches Kirill and hugs him. As he does he edges him away from the dockside. The three of them are locked in a long embrace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nikolai emerges from the embrace with Christine in his arms. He quickly hands her to Anna who hugs her close. Kirill turns to Nikolai.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I swear I didn't know my dad was setting you up.

A pause. Kirill dries his eyes and heads for the car. Nikolai looks at Anna, who is hugging the baby. He waits a long time before realizing he must leave her.
</DIRECTION>
<NIKOLAI>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're OK, yeah?
	</DIALOGUE>

<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who are you really? Why have you helped us?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
Nikolai can't answer truthfully, though he longs to do so. There is a long pause before he manages to finds a suitable lie.
</DIRECTION>
<NIKOLAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How can I become King if the King is still in place?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKOLAI>
<DIRECTION>
A pause. He laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna studies him, unsure. More New Year fireworks explode over the river. Kirill yells from the car...
</DIRECTION>
<KIRILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You come on, Nikolai! We're missing the fucking party of the year out there!! Get here and drive!!

She shakes her head.

<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's someone I can call. He'll come and fetch us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
Nikolai nods, not liking the information but hiding it. Nikolai comes close and gently uncovers Christine's face. He smiles. Kirill is hooting the car horn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a moment Nikolai and Anna kiss each other gently before Nikolai heads for the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HELEN'S HOUSE. KITCHEN - DAY

<DIRECTION>
A summer's day. Anna, Helen and Uncle Stepan are preparing to eat Sunday lunch. Stepan is carving. The conversation is jovial as Anna and Helen bring dishes of food to the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then we hear a baby crying. Anna goes to a small crib and lifts a six-month-old Christine out. She hands her to Helen who hugs her. Over this happy scene we hear Tatiana in V.O., a repeat of the first words we heard her say.
</DIRECTION>
