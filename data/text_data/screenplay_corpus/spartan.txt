EXT. WOODED HILLSIDE. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see the drawn face of a young woman. Camera tracks with her as she runs through the thick woods. She is exerting herself heavily as she moves up a steep hillside. She looks behind her quickly, and continues.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, we see a young man, and then another, running through the woods, out of breath. They are dressed in filthy BDU's, and show several days growth of beard. The leader stops for a moment, and looks around. The two men separate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, the young woman, who has come to a small ledge, over a ravine. She stops, panting, and bends over, to attempt to catch her breath. She looks around, and looks back, her back to a steep wall, a steep drop before her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, the first young man, having come up to the spot vacated by the young woman. In the BG we see his colleague. He looks down, and sees movement in the brush below him, in the ravine. He starts to descend, and then looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, the young woman, pulling herself up the steep rockface. The young man regains the ledge and looks up. Camera takes him around a bend in the ledge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standing here we discover ROBERT SCOTT. He is somewhat older than the two men, he is very fit, also dressed in filthy BDU's. He is making a note in a small notebook, which he closes. Now, the two men look across the ravine at the young woman, seen disappearing over a ridge.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...you better catch her...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
The man looks around, and begins climbing up the rockface behind him, pulling himself up, hand over hand by the roots of trees. Several feet up, he falls on his back. He tries to work himself to his knees and winces in pain. He looks to Scott for help.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...your Dad's napping on the sofa, your Mom's watching Let's Make A Deal, and God is Dead. What do you expect me to do...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<YOUNG_MAN>

</YOUNG_MAN>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's always a way...Don't You tell me there's no way...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
A pause, as the man tries again to get to his feet. Scott looks up at the young woman on top of the ridge and gives her a "hold" gesture. She stops, at his command. Scott nods, as if to himself, and then kicks the young man in the ribs. The man starts, his eyes grow, and he gets to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How 'bout that? That's called 'Adrenaline'. You said you Wanted In.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
He moves into the now-standing young man, and hits him, not heavily, but convincingly, several times.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is where you get in. The mugger don't care. The shooter don't care...get up...Or I will beat you to death on this fucken hill...Now: you better Catch her...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
He motions with his head. In the BG we see the young woman nod, and begin running again. We see her, for a moment, breast a hill, and disappear again...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, on the young man, as he looks at Scott, empty, now, of self-pity, as if he just realized something.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
(responding to his look. As if to say "That's right.")
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's nothing but the mission...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
The young man begins to climb the rockface.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HOLD on Scott for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRAINING FACILITY. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A large, hand-painted sign hangs on the cinderblock wall of the rough building. It reads:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
These are the precincts of pain. A goddess lives here. Her name is Victory.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In front of the sign walks the young woman we saw earlier. She is exhausted, she has a towel wrapped around her neck. Camera takes her to Scott, who is holding a cup of coffee, and making notes in the small notebook we saw earlier.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stands, waiting, as she finishes his note.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well done.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<YOUNG_WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(JACKIE BLACK)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A signal honor to work with you, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_WOMAN>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Sergeant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
He starts away from her, and she raises her hand slightly, to indicate she has something more to say. He turns back to her.
</DIRECTION>
<JACKIE_BLACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir: Day or Night. Black or White. You reach out for me. "Black, Jaqueline A. US 24191489."
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACKIE_BLACK>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll remember, Sergeant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
She nods, and walks off. Scott walks toward a mess tent. He is joined by George Blane, a very military-looking figure of an older man. He wears an informal fatigue outfit, mismatched jacket and trousers, without insignia. Scott is greeted by him, as they walk toward the mess tent. Scott shows the notebook to Blane, and Blane refers from the notebook to what we see are a group of eighty young men, in the mess tent, two of them the men we saw on the hill. Blane takes the notebook and walks off, as Scott enters the mess tent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE HIS POV, Scott enters the tent. Several of the young men react to him. He nods to them. Among them, we see the young man Scott berated on the hill, who rises and comes over to Scott.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, on Scott, who sits, as a uniformed man brings him a tinfoil tray with some food on it. Scott takes out a stiletto from his pocket, presses a button and the blade emerges. He begins to use it to cut up his meat. The young man from the hill, Anton, stands sheepishly near Scott, till Scott turns, acknowledging him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anton takes a card out of his pocket, the size of a credit card, old, creased cardboard: It reads, "Rogers Rangers, Rules for Engagement. 1782". There is a line drawing of a man with a musket, and we read, on the card, beneath it, boldtype rules for fighting guerilla style. Written on the card, in old faded ink, "SGT. Anton, M. US. 3149584, United States Special Forces." The young man (Anton) shows the card to Scott.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
(of the card)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's this then?

	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTON>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He carry it Over There?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
As they speak, we see, in an insert, the printed rules - "Dated 1759". "Rule 4: Tell the truth about what you see and what you do - there is an army depending on us for correct information. You can lie all you please when you tell other folks about the Rangers, but don't never lie to a Ranger or an Officer".
</DIRECTION>
<ANTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTON>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He come back?

<ANTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, sir. He did.

</ANTON>
<SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
(nods. Pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
Scott pauses again. As he looks at the young man, who is obviously unable to express his gratitude, and sense of occasion.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You carry that card, son. It might save your life.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Anton nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...You could use it to light a fire, or something...
	</DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
<ANTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just wanted to say, sir...That, to meet you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTON>
<SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
(rising, as he gives
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	the Ranger card back
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
to Anton)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You never met me. You've been up for a week. You're seeing Snakes...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
The exhausted men come to their feet, and into a line. They are happy, and joking with one another. In the BG we see those who failed the course, sitting apart, file onto a bus which has just pulled up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE on a young man, who looks out of the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE HIS POV. Twenty or so similarly exhausted men, with dufflebags, are being shuffled onto the bus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, on the young man, Anton, as he exits the tent, who stands next to Scott, outside the tent. Scott stands next to an old, but pristine Mustang Cobra. He withdraws a small dufflebag from the front seat, and looks up to see Anton standing next to him.
</DIRECTION>
<ANTON>
<DIRECTION>
(looking after the departing, failed men)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I can't imagine how they live with it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTON>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE on Scott. As he thinks a very brief moment, as if reluctant to become philosophical, and then turns back to Anton.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Make sure you can't imagine it, cause, if you can, it's just one step to doing it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
Anton shakes his head, sadly, at the spectacle of the failed men.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...they'll be back where they came from by Morning, and all this is just a Bad Dream.

	Congratulations on completion of this evolution. I know you would probably like some sleep, but I do not think you'd mind sparing ten minutes for Induction.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLANE_S_AIDE>
<DIRECTION>
The camera pans over the smiling faces of the eight very proud young men.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE on Blane and Scott, off to the side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beyond them, we see the bus holding the failed candidates, filling up.
</DIRECTION>
<BLANE>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
These two men steps forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, on Anton, nodding to himself at the proudest moment of his life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, CU Scott, looking at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Camera takes Blane and Scott into a cinderblock building which houses a shooting range. We see various housefronts, and storefronts, and targets. A long table along one wall holds a coffee urn. Blane draws two cups of coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the open door we see Anton and Grossler, smiling, entering the building. Anton comes into the room, and smiles at Scott.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see Scott look away, sadly. He shares a look with Blane, drains his coffee cup, crumples it, throws it away. Blane gestures to Scott, meaning, "Shall we begin?" Scott hesitates for a moment, and then nods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FOCUS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, on Scott, in the BG, as Blane steps forward to address the two candidates.
</DIRECTION>
<BLANE>
<DIRECTION>
(over his shoulder, to an Aide)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...would you bolt the door, please...?

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...are you tired, Gentlemen?
	</DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the completion of the evolution:

<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only one of you may join the unit. The first man through that door will be inducted.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLANE>
<DIRECTION>
He gestures at a far door in the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, on Scott, as he looks at the candidates, as they get the picture.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
(to himself, quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...yeah...you wanted to know the 'secret knowledge'...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
CU Scott as he looks, interrogating the two men, weighing them, as they look at each other. Beat. Grossler starts to advance on Anton, in a fighting crouch. Scott gestures to the Aide that that was what he wanted to see.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Aide lets Scott out of the back door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CINDERBLOCK BUILDING. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scott, showered, in civilian clothes, a lumberjacket and jeans, comes out of the building, carrying a small, yellow duffle-bag. He opens the trunk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes the yellow bag, and puts it into the trunk which we now see contains woodworking tools - old levels and planes and saws. He closes the trunk. We see the young woman from the first sequence, now in civilian clothes, conferring with a colleague. She nods at him, and he responds. As he starts to get into the car. A squad of exhausted men is marching past. As they come to a halt one of the men turns in the direction of Scott.
</DIRECTION>

	</DIALOGUE>
</DRILL_INSTRUCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CONSTRUCTION TRAILER. DUSK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A young worker in a hardhat, by a large gravel pit, at which we find several earthmovers, idle. He is standing by a high chainlink fence topped with barbed wire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE HIS POV. Some half-mile away, the Mustang, heading in his direction on a rough road. The young worker opens the lock on the chainlink fence and swings it open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see a sign "McGarrity Construction Company" on the gate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The young man walks back toward a construction trailer. We see a red light blinking on a telephone on top of a littered desk. The young worker enters the trailer hurriedly, and opens a cabinet which we see contains several assault rifles, and grenades. Another phone, its red light blinking, is found in the cabinet. The young worker picks up this phone quickly.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_WORKER>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Frontgate...

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MUSTANG. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scott, driving, comes around a bend.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE HIS POV. The construction trailer up ahead. We see the young worker come out of the trailer, and stand in the road giving a "Stop" signal to the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE EXT. THE CAR. We see Scott bring the Mustang to a stop, and get, inquisitively, out of the car. We see the young worker run up to him and hand him a sheet of paper. Scott takes the paper and begins to read.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up, to ask a question of the young worker. We see the worker begin to respond, his body language saying "That's all I know." As he starts to speak his words are drowned out by the sound of a helicopter. Scott looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE HIS POV. A helicopter, flying low.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE INT. THE HELICOPTER. A man in civilian clothes points out Scott, on the ground, to the Pilot. Through the canopy we see Scott and the construction canopy down below. The helicopter goes into a tight turn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE Scott. Above him, the helicopter goes into its turn, and begins to descend in a field some fifty yards away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, the sheet of paper Scott holds. Is reads: "All hands." Over the throbbing of the helicopter, we see Scott giving directions about the car, to the young worker. Camera takes Scott to the trunk, which he opens, and from which he retrieves his gym bag. He hands the keys to the young worker, and takes off, running, to the helicopter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, on Scott, as he is pulled up aboard, and the helicopter takes off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, over the worker, watching the helicopter disappear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HELICOPTER. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scott, asleep. As the helicopter banks low over the Charles River and Harvard College. A Crewman shakes him awake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, EXT: the helicopter descends into the field of a football stadium. A black suburban is waiting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BOATHOUSE. CHARLES RIVER. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seen through the windshield of a car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, a black, government Suburban pulls outside the boathouse. We see scaffolding being erected outside the main entrance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scott and several types in suits get out of the Suburban, and proceed toward the door, over which is hung a large, paint-spattered drape. A sign on a stanchion reads "Temporarily Closed For Repairs".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, INT. THE BOATHOUSE. The group pushes through the drape, beyond which we see several men in suits, holding assault rifles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An older government type, MILLER, followed by an AIDE, walks up to meet the group, the Aide motions to the armed guards that Scott is to be admitted, that he is "okay". Miller gestures to Scott that it will just be a moment. The Aide hands Scott a sheaf of papers, and leads him through the boathouse. We see the long skiffs up on their rests, the Charles River beyond.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE on Scott. As Scott looks through the papers. Around him we see communications equipment being hurriedly assembled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE INSERT. The top sheet shows a color photo of a phenomenally lovely redheaded girl in her teens. As Scott talks, he leafs through the sheets to reveal several photos of her and a man, obviously her father, holding her hand. One is a print of a glossy magazine article.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>

	<DIALOGUE>
	It seems she got a makeover today. We're working on it.

ANGLE on Scott. CU. As he watches the interrogation of Gaines in the next room. The young man begins to pick up his coffee cup, and we see that it shakes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE on Scott, as he gestures to Miller to look through the glass, at the young man being interrogated, who is now seen to be wiping his brow, and shaking his head. The young man tries to take a sip of coffee, and spills it, inadvertently, down his shirtfront. Scott exchanges a glance with Miller, and walks into the equipment room, to the interrogation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man being interrogated, the government type, Gaines, is in his early thirties. He is sweating and obviously frightened. An Aide comes and stands by Scott.

HOLD on Scott, at the back of the group, taking notes. We see him holding several newsclippings. One of them shows the girl, and the headline reads "America is Seeing Red."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see the photo blown up, of the ravishingly beautiful young girl with long red hair. It features a small, red enamel crescent earring. The second photo shows the same girl, in the same pose, but now her hair is short and platinum blonde and spiky. The agent opens two boxes and begins distributing the photos to the group.

EXT. HARVARD YARD. NIGHT.

<DIRECTION>
Two students, walking through the yard. They acknowledge a uniformed security guard, who walks, with his back to us.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A slight, Asian young woman, her arms full of books, walks toward the camera, hurrying. She indicates something, back over her shoulder, and the guard, who is in front of the camera, walking away, veers off in that direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. VESTIBULE, HARVARD DORM. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A young man (MICHAEL BLAKE) is, furtively, working on jimmying open one of a set of mailboxes. He senses something, and turns.
</DIRECTION>

ANGLE HIS POV. The Security Guard (Scott) standing just beyond a glass door, looking in at him. Scott enters, coming to camera.

<SCOTT>

	Could I see your hands, son...?

ANGLE INT. THE VESTIBULE. On Scott, as he watches Blake take a letter out of the jimmied mailbox.

He begins to fumble with keys at his belt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE INT. THE ROOM. Several agents, obviously involved in investigating the room, wearing plastic gloves, stop. One, silently, unlocks the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see Scott enter the room, "miming" using a key, and turn on the light and look inside. We take him to her desk, where he finds several photos of her and her father - and a note on he desk, reading "Dear Dad-Thanks for coming-signed %-)".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see the boy, Blake, out in the corridor, unable to see into the room.

EXT. HARVARD YARD. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blake and Scott sitting on a bench in the deserted yard. Scott holds the envelope and the letter, on which we see this symbol %-) and begin to read: "This is a sham. Your view of the world is not cockeyed, but corrupt. You cunt. And you deserve everything that is going to happen to you..."

<SCOTT>

	If you would...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLAKE>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE. From inside the windshield of the van we see, through their body language, that Scott is "giving the boy a break", the boy is very thankful. Scott is admonishing him and the boy is contrite. Now Scott begins to walk away, and we see him minutely, signal to the van, we see the driver of the van pick up a phone and speak softly into it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, Scott, walking down a sidestreet. The boy in the BG, we see the young Asian girl, take up a tailing position some half-block back of the boy, as a car glides to the curb. And Scott gets in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, tight on Scott in the car, as he rubs his eyes, beyond exhaustion. The car pulls away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He gives several instructions to the young man driving, and then leans back, eyes closed. He opens his eyes again, and we see him mouth, insistently, "The Regency". The driver nods.

<DIRECTION>
We see Miller, in the BG, in a hurried conference, nod at Scott.
</DIRECTION>
<MILLER>
<DIRECTION>
(looking at a chart)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"The Colophon - 36-foot sloop". Where is she...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILLER>
<DIRECTION>
They walk off, an Aide talking to him.
</DIRECTION>
<AIDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...the Coast Guard has a watch over this area:

<DIRECTION>
(he points to the chart)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And they have scheduled the Colophon first...
	</DIALOGUE>
</AIDE>
<DIRECTION>
Scott and the Agent stop in front of the interrogation room, where we see the agent, Gaines, a guard over him. Gaines is sitting, looking as if he had been weeping. The guard addresses Scott and the other agent.
</DIRECTION>
<GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He copped to it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He copped to what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<GUARD>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Off-post - punched out early to go boffing his girlfriend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
Scott shakes his head as if to say "How about that..." The agent holds a photo of a very lovely Eurasian woman in a business suit, and shows it to Scott.
</DIRECTION>
<AGENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hope she was worth it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGENT>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh huh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
Scott stands wearily, watching several large men berating the seated Secret Service Agent. An agent appears with a tearsheet showing the ad for "The Regency Club". We see the ad for exotic young companions, and the address is Boston. Scott gives instructions to the Aide.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE INT. WASHROOM. Scott, having stripped off his shirt, is washing himself at the sink. The "Regency" ad, and a description of the club is pasted with water to the mirror before him. We read, in the mirror: "REGENCY. 243 Charles Street, Boston, Mass. Owners of Record..." Et Cetera. In the mirror we see the Aide bring a fresh shirt and a tie to Scott. Scott turns, as the door swings, and he sees, in the BG, ANTON, just entering the establishment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE INT. THE BOATHOUSE. A Swat team is laying out its weapons and assault gear, on a long table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HOLD on Anton, who is standing, unassigned, and looking it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see, on an improvised bulletin board, photos of the Boy, Blake, the Professor, and the Girl, blown up from a newspaper shot, and in various photos. As we watch an Agent walks up with a box full of photos, and tacks one up on the board. It is an altered shot showing the young girl with short, spikey platinum hair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE on Scott, dressed in a clean shirt, a tie, as he takes a photo from the box. We see him put it next to the original, blonde photo, and look at both.
</DIRECTION>
<AGENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We ran it up from a description of the colorist from the Beauty Parlor...
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGENT>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gimme your coat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
The Agent takes off his suitcoat, and gives it to Scott, who puts it on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, on Scott, as he holds the photos, and the Regency description. He walks toward the door, through the mass of agents. He stops by Miller, who is on the phone, looking at a photograph of the Professor, as a tech hooks up a video feed of a house on the water, the Professor's house. A photo of a sailboat is tacked up. We read 'The Colophon' on its stern.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
(to Miller)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need five thousand dollars.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
Miller gestures "Just a Moment", and then waves to an Aide, meaning "Do It".
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How long do we have? Sir?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<MILLER>
<DIRECTION>
(shakes his head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It hits the papers, and we're done.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILLER>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No...note? No...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
Miller shakes his head, he holds up the "Regency" note...
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
(nodding)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got it...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Miller)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I have some backup?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
Miller, gesturing around the room, meaning "what you see is what you get". All the occupants of the room are engaged on some task, save Anton, who sits alone on a bench. Scott looks at Anton, who glances at Scott, trying to keep the appeal out of his glance, "Please take me".
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
(to Anton)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're scraping the bottom of the barrel here, aren't we?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<ANTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTON>
<DIRECTION>
Scott looks at Anton and shakes his head. He is summoned to the front of the room by a young woman, who is putting cash into an envelope. Scott comes over to her, and we see her filling out a slip of paper. She hands him the cash in the envelope, and the slip of paper.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need you to sign it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_WOMAN>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sign it.

<DIRECTION>
(He scans the room
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	again, shrugs, and
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
motions to Anton)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Wallflower...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Anton rises and walks over to him)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scott turns to Anton.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now: your mouth shut. Your eyes open, and form on me...Here's where we're going...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
There is the sound of a gunshot. Scott and Anton instinctively take cover against the side of the building, drawing their sidearms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HOLD TIGHT on Scott. As he looks through the half-open door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see several of the Swat men, taking up positions, one of them kicks open a door, and his partner enters. Pause. We hear the partner call "clear".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, on Scott, as he re-enters the building, and proceeds, pistol out, toward the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE HIS POV. On the floor, we see the dead Secret Service Agent, a pistol in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see Miller turn to his team. An Agent kneels to the fallen Secret Service Agent, and prods a small hideout pistol from his hand. Scott turns to leave, and sees Anton standing next to him.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't look at him. Don't look at the Downed Man. He's dead...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as he turns his back on the scene)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kick the fool overboard...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE on Anton and Scott as they leave. In the BG we see Miller et al. Miller giving directions.
</DIRECTION>
<MILLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...who is the girl he went to see? Get her in...The girl he was fucking...Who's got the Coastguard...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILLER>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT on Anton and Scott as they exit the building.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd hate to be the Lucky Duck who frisked him...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
<ANTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was off-post when they snatched the girl?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTON>
<SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
(as he looks at the fallen agent)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Well, apparently, he felt bad about it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. REGENCY CLUB. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A garish neon sign, beneath which we see a couple exiting, getting into their limo. Scott, in his sportcoat, walks up to the large and threatening bouncer at the velvet rope to the club. We see the bouncer bar his way, and gesture to his watch, meaning "closing up".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE INS. Two one-hundred dollar bills are passed to the bouncer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, Anton, in a cab across the street, looking on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE INT. THE REGENCY CLUB. Several well-dressed couples are leaving. A group of raucous, drunk businessmen types push past them. Scott walks up to the bar. The Bartender is beginning to ring out the cash register. In the BG we see a manager eye Scott, and continue to direct the closing operations.
</DIRECTION>
<BARTENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Closing up...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he points to his watch)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't sell you booze after 3 AM.

(laying money on the bar)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no. I just came buy to pay you that money I owe you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
He gestures to the bills on the bar. The Bartender swoops them up, and gestures to the back bar, meaning "What'll you have?" Scott points to a bottle of Bourbon, the Bartender pours for him.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
(as he drinks)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...how about them Sox, huh...?

</BARTENDER>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Abso, absolutely...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
He brings out his case, with the photo of the platinum- haired girl. The Bartender comes over and glances at it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE XCU on Scott as he looks incisively at the Bartender, who displays no flicker of recognition.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...girl like that been in tonight...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<BARTENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...pretty girl...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARTENDER>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	None prettier.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE on Scott, who looks around the club. We see him eyeing the lovely young scantily clad waitresses, who return his looks with disdain. The Bartender, observing him, comes back to him.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah...I'm looking for a girl like that...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<BARTENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...You're sure it was your daughter...? B'cause, a lot of guys, come in here, guys your age, go home with some...some rather 'younger' girl...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARTENDER>
<DIRECTION>
The Bartender smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
(as he leans forward)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, why would a, one of these 'younger girls'. What would they want to do with me...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
The Bartender leans close and hesitates. Scott takes out several more bills and passes them to the Bartender.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He hesitates a second, as if to say "You wouldn't fuck me, would you...?" The Bartender signs, "I am your man", the Bartender takes the bills and leans close and whispers to Scott, indicating someone over in a dark corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In this corner, as the lights are flicked up, we see a youngish man in very expensive casual clothes, an American, dressed like Eurotrash, sitting talking with the man we saw earlier was the Manager. As Scott approaches, we see the Manager, knowingly, drift off. Beat. The young man (ZIMMER) rises from the booth, and tugs himself into neatness, and stops, as if bemused by Scott.
</DIRECTION>
<ZIMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Howdy, Pard'.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZIMMER>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>

Zimmer starts for the front door, and Scott falls into step with him.

	</DIALOGUE>
</ZIMMER>
<DIRECTION>
Camera takes the two out of the front of the club, where Zimmer tips the bouncer, who his putting on his coat, preparatory to going away for the night. Zimmer begins walking into a parking lot, where we see several run-down employee's cars, and his, Zimmer's prime Mercedes. Scott tags along.
</DIRECTION>
<BOUNCER>

	My, my, my, my, my, my question was: why would a young girl want to go out with an older man like me? And, if you could "answer" that...

He takes out money from his pocket. Zimmer begins to speak slightingly, dismissively to the 'hick'.
</DIRECTION>
<ZIMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Bub...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZIMMER>
<DIRECTION>
Zimmer starts to open his car door. He turns back to Scott, and we see, Zimmer's POV, Anton, standing behind Scott, at the doorway to an alleyway. Obviously backing Scott up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE CU, Zimmer reacts infinitesimally, to the sight of Anton.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE XCU, Scott, sees him, and slams him against the side of the car. Zimmer reaches through the half-open door, and comes out with an automatic pistol in his hand. Scott kicks him in the stomach, Zimmer tries to raise the hand with the gun, and Scott throws him to the ground, the pistol falls on the concrete.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE on Scott as Anton emerges from the alley. Scott directs him to drag Zimmer into the alleyway, near a dumpster. Anton thrusts his hand into the car and starts to reach for the dropped pistol.

	</DIALOGUE>
</BUSINESSMAN>
<DIRECTION>
There is a beat. And the far door in the vestibule is buzzed open. As it opens several men in Swat gear stream through the vestibule and up the stairs. Scott hands the Businessman over to an Agent, who takes charge of him, and camera holds on Scott, standing, wearily, at the bottom of the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He motions for Anton near him to hand him a cigarette. Anton does so. Scott lights up. From the top of the stairs we hear screams, sounds of breaking, yells, commands being shouted.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. An Agent comes to the top of the stairs, looks down, and shakes his head. Beat. Scott turns and finds the handcuffed Businessman in his field of vision.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...they got some young girls up there...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. The Businessman, terrified, is silent. Scott holds out the photo of the girl in the black hair.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see this girl...?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Businessman looks at the photo. Scott gestures at Anton, and passes the photo of Laura Newton to Anton. And then looks as if to say "In or Out?" Anton hesitates a moment, and then strikes the Businessman.
</DIRECTION>
<ANTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you See This Girl...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTON>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE on the Businessman, on the ground. Terrified. He looks back at Scott, as if unable to focus. Scott gives him a beat, nods, as if to say, "What would you expect", and starts up the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WHOREHOUSE. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scott enters the vaguely Japanese modern establishment. Several Swat figures are being stood down. They sit, sharing a thermos of coffee. One of the Swat team nods to Scott, and motions him to the direction he knows Scott wants to go.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Camera takes Scott past a room where two female Agents are holding five young women, who are supervised, changing out of "escort" wear, and into jeans and sweatshirts, "streetclothes".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE on Scott, as he enters what is obviously the "office" of the Bordello. One of the techs is sitting at a bashed-in computer, he is hooking it up to another laptop. He turns to Scott.
</DIRECTION>
<TECH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...she was trying to scrub the thing...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TECH>
<DIRECTION>
Beyond them we see Miller. And a very attractive European- looking woman in her forties. In a room beyond two bodyguard types are handcuffed, watched over by a Swat officer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scott moves back to watch Miller interrogating the woman, the Madam, who speaks with a middle-European accent.
</DIRECTION>
<MADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...an escort service. There is no impropriety, and there is no...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MADAM>

</MILLER>
<TECH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Nadya Tellich, Serb. Green Card, in...

Miller waves the rest of the information away. Miller shows her the photo.
</DIRECTION>
<MILLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you seen this girl...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILLER>
<NADYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We see a lot of girls. They apply. For the job, as Hostesses...
	</DIALOGUE>
</NADYA>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE on Scott, who stands by the Tech, who is trying to reconstruct the broken computer. It prints out a file, on which we see photos of various faces. Each girl holds a placard with a number on it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE on Anton, who looks down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE HIS POV. The wastebasket. In the BG we hear Nadya going on about the benefits of working as a Hostess. He motions to Scott.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scott squats to the ground, and pours out what are revealed to be several polaroids of beautiful young women. He uses his knife to rearrange them without touching them. They are now alighted and we see the numerals twelve, thirteen, fifteen, on placards which they hold up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE on Scott, as he walks back into the interrogation room, holding the sheet printed out by the computer.
</DIRECTION>
<NADYA>
	<DIALOGUE>

Miller takes the photos of Laura and shows the platinum- haired one to Nadya.
</DIRECTION>
<MILLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...is this the Girl? Is this her? Was she in here?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Izzat her? It's her, isn't it. She was here. Is that her...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILLER>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, on Scott, as he steps away. He takes us through the Whorehouse. In the adjacent room we see a bank of video monitors, showing people in various sexual activities. On the screen for a moment comes the face of what looks like a very young girl indeed, camera swerves onto the face of the Businessman we saw outside the Whorehouse, he is disrobing,...
</DIRECTION>
<BUSINESSMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(ON TAPE)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...come over here, you little bitch...That's right, get your sweet ass over here...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUSINESSMAN>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE on Scott. As he looks to the Businessman, himself, who is seated in a chair, presided over by several agents, forced to watch the video. He turns his head away.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
(to an Agent)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Make him watch it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
One of the agents turns the Businessman's head brusquely back.
</DIRECTION>
<BUSINESSMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I...I...listen...listen: I'm a wealthy man. I am, I am not- without-friends in, in the Administration...

it to Scott)

	...whatever it takes to...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUSINESSMAN>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This here, sir. This is a piece of cardboard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
Scott holds the card. He shakes his head sadly. Scott nods to the Interrogator and Scott throws the card into the Businessman's lap.
</DIRECTION>
<INTERROGATOR>
<DIRECTION>
(as the Businessman starts to look away)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you look away, you son of a bitch...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he forces him to watch the video)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE CU, on Scott, as he looks disgusted. Anton stands on one side, looking to Scott for a cue as to how to react.
</DIRECTION>
<BUSINESSMAN>

	I...I...I...

He holds the photo of the platinum-haired Laura Newton.

	<DIALOGUE>
	turning from Anton to

the "good" cop)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen to me: I cannot. Be caught here. You write an amount on a sheet of paper...write it on my card...

pulls him off)

	<DIALOGUE>
	LEAVE ME ALONE, I'LL GET THE TRUTH OUT OF HIM...

(he picks up the man's business card)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come in here, try to buy me off? I've got Three Daughters...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
Anton succeeds in pulling Scott off the Businessman. He drags him around a corner. We see the terrified Businessman in the background, as Anton tries to reason with Scott.
</DIRECTION>
<ANTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...maybe we'd...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTON>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, on Scott, now appearing transformed, and easy. He gestures "shusshh" to Anton, meaning "It is all an act". In the BG we see the Interrogator browbeating the Businessman.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
(as he looks down at
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	the Businessman's card, and shakes his head. He moves back toward the Businessman,
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
terrifying him)

Laura to the Businessman)

	Where Is This Girl...

</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
The Businessman is terrified. He looks around the room in panic.

ANGLE on Scott, as camera takes him to where the Female Agent is interrogating the Young Whore. Anton follows.

<YOUNG_WHORE>

Miller nods and the three walk out of the room.

<MILLER>

	<DIALOGUE>
	They don't know who they've got...they just snatched "some Young Girl". When they find out, they're going to have to...

Scott moves back to Nadya.
</DIRECTION>

for sympathy)

	<DIALOGUE>
	...they'll kill me.

<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>

</SCOTT>
<NADYA>

</NADYA>
<DIRECTION>
Miller pushes a pad of paper and a pencil across to her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE TIGHT on Scott. As he looks on. Beat. He nods, as if to say "We're getting there". There is the sound of a phone ringing, and an Agent comes in, and beckons Miller, who waves him away. The Agent indicates, "No, you have to take this call." Miller steps back from Nadya, not wanting to break the mood, and moves toward the phone. Scott moves to stand by the girl.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE on Scott as he pushes the paper toward her, again, forcing and willing her to put down the number.

<DIRECTION>
INT. STADIUM BUILDING, LUNCHROOM. NIGHT.

ANGLE, on an assembly of the information of the chase. On a table, the photos of the Eurasian businesswoman, of Laura Newton, of the Regency Club. A disassembled machine pistol, and a cup of steaming coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HOLD on Scott, looking at something, off. As he picks up the cup of coffee. Beyond him we see Anton, asleep in his chair.

</MILLER>
<DIRECTION>
Scott and Anton start to get to their feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COPLEY SQUARE, DOWNTOWN. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the foreground we see a lonely payphone in the deserted square. It is festooned with ads for escort services. In the deep background we see the lights on in a corner bank building, and the cleaners at work.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE INT. THE BANK. One of the cleaners polishes the counter in the bank. He wipes his brow and looks outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE HIS POV. A sedan at the curb. Beyond it, a man, smoking a cigarette, stands near the payphone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man looks at his watch, looks around, throws away the cigarette, and continues to pace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, in the bank the "Cleaner" whispers into a lapel mike.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BOSTON STREET. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scott, in the backseat of a car, apparently asleep. Anton, sitting in the front. Listening to the faint sounds from an earwig.

</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...who's walking up on us...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, Anton, as he looks around, down at Scott, and then up, at a man in a suit, some thirty yards away, walking towards the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anton, as the man draws closer, looks down at Scott, as if to say "How did you know"?
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
(as he loosens his jacket, over his pistol)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...who is he?

</SCOTT>
<ANTON>

	Boston. P.D.

We see Scott, relax for a moment. And then, putting Anton out of his misery.

<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...always a reflective surface...

(then, to himself, as if reciting a litany)
</DIRECTION>

HOLD. On Anton, as he digests this. BEAT.

EXT. BOSTON STREET. DAY.

Anton starts to put the car in gear, an Agent comes jogging down the street, out of an alley, and motions Anton aside, and gets into the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BOSTON HIGHWAY. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A shot of the helicopter, flying over the highway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, the sedan speeding down the deserted highway, the city in the background. The helicopter, flying away overhead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SCOTT'S CAR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Driver, Scott, and Anton. Listening to transmissions on the radio. As they drive Anton leans forward, his hands on the seatback of the front seat. Scott picks up one of Anton's hands, and turns it over.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
(of the hand)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...what is this...?

</SCOTT>
<ANTON>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...the ring clicks against your riflestock, some sonobitch hears that noise, hundred yards out, and you're gonna get me killed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
Anton nods, and begins to work the ring off his finger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE THEIR POV. Far ahead, the speeding sedan turns off the highway, onto a "feeder" road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anton and Scott in the backseat. As we see Anton take out a machine pistol from his "Go" bag, and check it. Scott looks at him. A chatter comes over the radio, and Scott addresses the two men in the front seat.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...where's he going...?

	<DIALOGUE>

(the Driver begins to
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	speak softly, relaying his instructions on the radio. Scott turns

to Anton. Softly)

<DIRECTION>
(Anton nods. Beat, as Scott looks him over)
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...breathe through your nose.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
Anton looks at Scott inquisitively, not sure he has heard right.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It stills the heartrate.

</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE the Sedan, on the deserted highway. HOLD. We see another car come screaming up behind it, doing one-ten, a red light on the roof, flashing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE INT. THE SEDAN. A middle-aged man watches the other car come up, and disappear around a bend, going furiously fast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ESSEX BEACH. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The margin of the scrubwoods, in the dunes. Scott and Anton, moving quietly through the woods. Scott points to Anton, indicating where he should stop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, Scott's POV. A run-down beach house on a deserted cove. The blue light of a television flickering through the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, Scott peering through some scrubgrass. We see he holds a small handful of torn-off grass before and over his face, to break up his outline. He turns. To Anton, who stands next to him, holding a sniper rifle. He points out a position to Anton.
</DIRECTION>
<ANTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...you want me to Come Through the Door...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTON>
<SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
(as he checks his weapons. He shakes his head.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you go through the door without an Overwatch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
He takes the small handful of grass and throws it into the air, watching the way the wind takes it. Scott gestures to Anton to take up a position beside a small run-down boat shed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see Anton do so, then Scott moves across the dunes, to a small skiff. Which lies just across a little cove from the beach house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, on Scott, as he moves down the dune, to the skiff. He opens his switchblade quietly, and severs the line holding the skiff to the dock. He gets into the skiff, and pushes it off, and we see it begin to drift across the little cove toward the beach house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, on Anton, kneeling, beside the old boat shed, as he assumes a prone position, and sights his rifle in on the beach house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, HIS POV. Through the sniperscope, the house, the television, flickering in an empty living room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE WOODS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anton, acknowledging the command. He finds a vantage point, and assumes the prone position, covering the house with his rifle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE on Scott, surveying the beach house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE HIS POV. The dark beach house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE on Scott, as he moves across the lawn, and to a back door. He removes his switchblade, opens it, and uses it to jimmy the screen latch. He replaces it, and takes out a set of lock picks, and begins to work on the door. We faintly hear the sound of a television.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE INT. THE BEACH HOUSE. We hear the sound of the TV and faintly, see a blue glow from a room or two down the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE on Scott, entering the kitchen, where he looks down at the various dirty plates and cups on the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE on Scott, coming through the door. As he moves, flat to the wall. Camera follows him past the doorway, beyond which we see the TV on low. Scott looks in, and finds it empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE on Scott, as we follow him into the bedroom. It is empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HOLD on Scott, looking around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, as he comes back into the living room. He stops. We see something beyond him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE HIS POV. A small boat some twenty yards from the house. Out near the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, on Scott, as he starts to open the rear, sliding glass door which will lead him out to the boat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind him, we see the MAN FROM THE SEDAN open the front door of the house, and begin to enter. Scott hears him, and turns.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN_FROM_THE_SEDAN>
<DIRECTION>
(as he sees Scott)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I heard the TV, so I came in...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Sedan Man is put a bit off, as the comment makes no sense. Scott uses the moment to advance toward the man.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...what the hell you got the TV on for, there's nobody here...?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(the man puts up his hands)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't wanna hurt you. Why would I hurt you? I just wanna know why the TV's on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE EXT. THE BUILDING. Where we see the man, and Scott. We see the scene in green, through a sniperscope.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, on Anton, looking through the scope.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE CU Anton, as he sees something in the scope.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, in the house. Scott advancing toward the man.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I just wannit to know, I just came to ask you that question...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
The man backs up, past a half-open glass French door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, on Scott, as he advances toward the man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, ANTON'S POV. Through the sniperscope. The faint traces of what might be the Picasso symbol.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, on Anton, as we see him move the sniperscope and adjust its magnification toward the symbol. In a corner of the scope, we see another man, in a dirty white shirt, emerge, coming up the stairs from what might be the basement of the beach house. We see this man take in the scene in the next room, and secrete himself behind a wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, on Anton, whose vision is blocked - Camera takes him to a position next to the white tool shed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scott, moving toward the Sedan Man, unaware of the man around the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE through the sniperscope. We see the man in the white shirt ready himself behind the opening through which Scott will come. We see him raise a pistol.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE Anton, as he realizes he is behind the curve. As the man in the white shirt steps into the doorway Anton fires at him through the sniperscope. We see this man fall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, INT. THE HOUSE. The man in the Sedan, his hands raised, fetches down a small shotgun from the lintel over the door, and levels it toward Scott. Who draws and fires several rounds at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE INT. THE HOUSE. As the man goes down heavily. Scott comes forward to the dying man, and kicks the shotgun away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Camera takes Scott warily into the next room, where he sees the man in the white shirt sprawled on the floor. Scott moves past him, and down to a door leading to the basement. Scott takes a long look down the basement stairs. We see a faint light, and a shadow moving across the light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE on Scott, as he takes a deep breath, and bursts down the stairs, screaming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE INT. The Basement. A rough, dirt-floored room. Scott standing alone. We see a bare bulb hanging from the ceiling, swinging slightly in the breeze from an open window.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm Coming Up...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, Anton, inside the house, in a covering position, watching out. Scott comes up the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
(to Anton)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Call em in...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
We see Anton take out a walkie and talk into it, Scott proceeds to the Sedan Man. He kneels by him.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...where's the girl...? You're dying, pal. Even it up. WHERE IS THE GIRL... WHERE IS THE GIRL...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
Scott pulls the dying, bloody man to him, and starts to shake him.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're dying. You're dying, man. Where is the girl...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. The man begins to shudder, violently, and then stops, obviously dead. Beat. Scott throws the dead man down onto the floor. Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, on Anton, who turns to look back. He stares at the dead man.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...well, you wanted to know...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause. Scott kicks the dead man viciously)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anton looks at Scott. Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
(to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, everybody wants to know the Secret Knowledge...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
Scott sits on a chair, by an old rolltop desk. On the desk we see a bunch of junk, old cigarette packets, empty. A box half-full of yellowing stationary. Scott prods the stationary with his knife. We read, in an insert: "Hanson Marine. Everything for the boat. Box 38 Essex, Mass." (and see, on the envelope, an old fashioned, stylized drawing of an old chriscraft-like power boat).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear the sound of a helicopter. And Scott turns, looking out of the window. He then turns back, to see Anton, who is standing, looking down at the man he shot. Anton, feeling Scott's gaze, turns to look at him.
</DIRECTION>
<ANTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTON>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...tell it to the Chaplain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
Scott gets up wearily, and walks toward the door out onto the beach. We see a helicopter landing, and several men in BDU's, jumping out, and proceeding toward the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STADIUM DRESSING ROOM. DAY.

Burch thinks a moment, he rubs his face, and shakes his head, and looks up as if to say "This is all we have, this is the best we have". Pause. He nods, as they do not move.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. COUNTRY ROAD. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Police Cruiser coming quickly down a two-lane, deserted road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE INT. THE CRUISER. A road sign reads "Just Two Miles To 'The Owl', Rest Stop, Restaurant, Gas-Diesel".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE EXT. THE OWL. Rest Stop. A run-down rural gas station, restaurant. Off to the side we see the cruiser coming down the road. As a roughly-dressed man runs out of the restaurant, carrying a full paper bag in his hand. The Cruiser, unseen by the man, pulls up to the gas pump, and the Trooper starts to get out of the driver's seat. When gunfire erupts from the restaurant. People are shooting at the fleeing man. A man opens the door of the restaurant and fires at the roughly-dressed man in a very urban leather jacket, who returns fire. Glass breaks in the windows of the restaurant.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The roughly-dressed man runs to his car, an 80's Pontiac, parked near the pumps. The man in the doorway fires again, and the windshield of the Pontiac blows out and a tire bursts. The roughly-dressed man returns fire, and the man in the doorway falls. The roughly-dressed man turns to see that the Trooper is out of his Cruiser, and is about to fire at him. The roughly-dressed man drops his satchel, and fires at the Trooper, who falls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The paper bag has fallen to the ground and burst, and currency is spilling out of it, and being taken on the wind. The roughly-dressed man frantically begins to try to scoop it up and into his jacket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE CU on this man, who we now see is SCOTT. He stands around, and moves to the fallen Trooper. He strips the keys from the Trooper's keyring, and looks up. Feeling someone gazing at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE HIS POV. In the car, two convicts, a Heavyset Man and ELI ASSANI, the middle-eastern man we saw in the mugshot. He is holding his neck, which is bleeding copiously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see the back window behind him, shattered by gunfire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE on Scott, who gets into the car, takes the keys he took from the Trooper, and begins screaming off down the highway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOW ANGLE, showing the car taking a turn vastly too fast, the car careens up on two wheels, rights itself, fishtails, corrects, and disappears in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE INT. THE CAR. Scott driving steals a look back at Assani, in the back seat, whimpering.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up.

ANGLE on Scott driving. He looks behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, POV. In the rearview mirror. A dust cloud settling over the deserted highway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE INT. THE OWL. Various techies, in the kitchen, monitoring the broadcast of the microphone in the Police Car, Anton among them. The Trooper comes in, taking off his bullet-proof vest, and sits to listen, where we find Miller and his Agents. The 'Restaurant Owner', who we now see is Anton, takes off his jacket and his bullet-proof vest and picks a slug, fired by Scott, out of the center of the vest.

Inside the house we see a female techie, at a table by the wall, various communications gear in front of her. Scott begins loading up his pockets with food. The techie hands Scott a slate on which is written, in large block letters, "The helo is standing by, will assault in support when you have found the girl. On your command." Scott gestures for the slate, and writes on it, and hands it back. Scott nods, and walks out of the house.

INT. TRAINING FACILITY. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see the Dojo, training room. Several exhausted young men in sweat stained fatigues watch a lecturer, with a knife in his hand, demonstrating a manoeuvre with a trainee.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beyond, on the wall, we see the sign. "These are the precincts of pain. A Godess lives here. Her name is Victory."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beyond, through the open doors, we see Scott's Mustang driven up to a nearby building. A young man gets out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, INT. THE BUILDING. Scott, rested, clean, shaved, drinking a cup of coffee. Sitting across a desk from an Interrogator, who has several notes in front of him.
</DIRECTION>
<INTERROGATOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...from the house, a house, a holding facility, a compound? called Maskala. The girls are taken from Maskala, to the ...Royale Hotel, in Dubai.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he closes the notes, as if completing his presentation)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As time passes, you may remember other aspects of...well,

<DIRECTION>
(the Interrogator stands)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've heard this speech before...
	</DIALOGUE>
</INTERROGATOR>
<DIRECTION>
He extends his hand to Scott. Scott looks inquisitively at him, then pauses, then stands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE EXT. THIS BUILDING. Scott exiting, as Blane comes out of his office. They walk through the compound. And to the camera, toward the Mustang.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...would be most grateful, sir, to be included on the mission. "At Such Time..."
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
<BLANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...on a mission to Dubai.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLANE>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it in contemplation, sir...?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, on Blane, who looks at him to say "you know better than to ask."
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If and When, Sir...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<BLANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You need a rest, Bobby.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause. as he extends his hand)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Bobby...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLANE>
<DIRECTION>
Scott puts down the small yellow duffle he carries, next to his Mustang. The young man who drove it in stands by, as Blane and Scott shake hands. Scott looks at the training facility.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE HIS POV. The lecturer, executing unarmed combat moves against a trainee, who holds a knife. The lecturer puts the trainee on his back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scott starts to walk toward this facility. He stands outside, by an open double-door, next to a water cooler, and draws himself a cup of water, which he drinks. As he watches the lesson.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns back, as he sees the young man who drove in the Mustang pick up the yellow duffle, to put it into the car.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...please don't touch that.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Scott picks up the
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	duffle and puts the
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
strap over his shoulder)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, Scott's POV, as he turns. We see the young female sergeant, Jackie Black, in the BG, walking across the area.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scott nods at her. She nods back. Scott starts to get into his car, and then turns back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE. SCOTT'S POV as the trainee on the mat gets up, and the lecturer gestures at the knife he has dropped on the mat.
</DIRECTION>
<LECTURER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...pick it up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LECTURER>
<DIRECTION>
The trainee picks up the knife. The lecturer shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<LECTURER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you studying here...? I'm talking to you, son... What are you studying?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LECTURER>
<TRAINEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, this Candidate is studying knife fighting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRAINEE>
<DIRECTION>
The lecturer pauses, looking down at the ground. Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<LECTURER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold your ground, son.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LECTURER>
<DIRECTION>
The Trainee goes into a knife fighting stance.
</DIRECTION>
<LECTURER>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing behind him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...you, and your friend...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LECTURER>
<DIRECTION>
The Trainee lets his attention drift for a second, in the direction the Lecturer has pointed. And the Lecturer screams, steps in, disarms the Trainee, throwing him to the mat. As the Trainee picks himself up the Lecturer turns to the class.
</DIRECTION>
<LECTURER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are two ways to fight, you can fight fair, or you can fight to win.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LECTURER>
<DIRECTION>
The Trainee puts his hand to his head, and discovers he is bleeding. The Lecturer nods his permission, and the Trainee walks to a water cooler, next to which Scott is standing. Scott looks at the shamed Trainee.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you study knife fighting, son. You Learn to Kill. And then, f'you meet some other fellow, studied knife fighting, you send him to hell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, on the Lecturer, who calls another Trainee up.
</DIRECTION>
<LECTURER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Next man:
	</DIALOGUE>
</LECTURER>
<DIRECTION>
A Trainee stands.
</DIRECTION>
<LECTURER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now: I want to see some evil intent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LECTURER>
<DIRECTION>
The Lecturer glances at Scott, and makes a small "have a drink" gesture. The Lecturer nods back "yes". Scott walks toward his car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. "CONSTRUCTION GATE". DAY.

The man inside the "construction booth" raises the barrier, and looks at Scott, who drives through.

<DIRECTION>
Scott gestures for another round to the bartender. Who is serving some rough trucker types, two of whom are at the bar with a couple of very attractive young women. One is a stunning redhead, who looks back at Scott.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>

<SCOTT>

</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
Scott is distracted. He is watching the talking heads, on the bar TV talking about Laura Newton. We see the photos of her in high school, with her father in some African country, et cetera.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE. On Grace, watching Scott. Who shakes his head very sadly.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. You Marines are a weepy bunch of motherfuckers.

the television)

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was talking to the television.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he turns to look at the girl)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That girl's too good-looking for you anyway. What are you "rich"? What do you, "own" something?

<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or are you "funny" or something...?

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, on the floor, a glass ashtray. The quarters fall into the ashtray.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, Scott, in bed, naked, comes awake, as the quarters hit the ashtray. He has a pistol in hand, and awakes with a start, screaming. He surveys the motel room, taking in his new surroundings. Beat. Next to him, the redhead from the bar, also naked, comes awake, frightened, looking at Scott.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, on Scott, as he surveys the hotel room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE HIS POV. On a dresser, a cheap imitation pewter bowl, an orange and a banana in it, on the table next to it, his switchblade, open, and the remains of a peeled apple. He looks at the knife, and at the girl.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You peel the apple?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
She nods, not sure how to take Scott.

clear it)

Stoddard, smoking a black cigar, and several "Bureau" types in the office. Scott is sitting at a conference table, as is Miller. Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<STODDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Number one, the girl's dead. Number two, the hide-out gun the Agent shot with's registered in his 1020 for the past five years. The man who tossed him has been sacked. His name is none of your concern. Now: what the fuck are you doing here?

EXT. GRAVESIDE. DAY.
</DIRECTION>

A small photograph on an easel - it is an image of Gaines, the dead Secret Serviceman.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, a small funeral. A Marine Honor Guard in attendance. Small suburban cemetery.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE on the Pastor.
</DIRECTION>
<PASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...in the Service. In the Service of his Country. No less than had he died in Combat. George Gaines, a man who gave his life to service, to protecting those who...

ANGLE, an unmarked sedan. Scott, and a Driver. Looking on.

<DRIVER>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Punched out early, off with the girlfriend, his Principal wanders off, winds up dead: hari-kari...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, on Scott, as he sees something. Scott takes a book of matches and starts to light a cigarette.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...rather you didn't smoke in here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
Scott gets out of the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, on Scott, who takes out the Anton "Rogers Rangers" card. He motions the driver to pass him a phone and Scott looks at the number on the card and dials.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beyond him we see, just at the limits of the gravesite. Holding himself apart. A young man in a raincoat. The young man turns at the sound of a limo driving up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE Scott, looking at the limo. Out of the limo, which stops near the grave, we see Burch emerge. There is a susurrus among the crowd, which, visibly, straightens a bit, at the honor of Burch's presence. We see Burch walk to the gravesite, and have a word with the widow. Burch puts his hands on her shoulders and comforts her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, on Scott, looking at the man in the raincoat. We hear rifle fire, and Scott flinches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE his POV. The Marine Honor Guard, rendering a salute. We see a Marine bear the flag to Burch, who presents it to the widow. He shakes several hands, and then moves off, back to the limousine. He beckons Scott over to him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, Scott and Burch, walking through the cemetery. Burch shakes his head. He hands Scott the program from the funeral, and reluctantly begins.
</DIRECTION>
<BURCH>

	I trusted you with my life.

	I trusted you with my life. And yet you cannot trust me.

<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, on the two.
</DIRECTION>
<BURCH>
<DIRECTION>
(almost as if against his better nature)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is an Arab World. To penetrate it makes trying to join the Mafia look like a walk in the park. How would you do it, Scott?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

	We're dying. We're at war. And we have no intelligence. How Would you do it? How would you infiltrate their clan structure? Where is the interface?

<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>

	It's at the whorehouse. That's where they go to get frisky, and that's where we listen to them. For the few, priceless hints that we get from that fucking sandpile.

<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Had the girl been there, we would have moved heaven and earth - you know we would, and, we would have got her out. She was not there. She got drugged up and fell off a boat, and drowned. She's dead.

<DIRECTION>
(of the funeral)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That man,

(Burch gestures at the
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	photograph-on-the- easel, of George Gaines, the Secret Service man, which stands by the
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
head of the grave)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That man a sworn office of the Secret Service, went to get laid, and she died. And you are risking the lives of men and women in the field, because you won't take orders. How are you better than him? Yes. You had best look sheepish. What the fuck have you got to say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURCH>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No excuse, sir.

</SCOTT>
<BURCH>

	You're goddam right.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Now: where's this new kid who got you all bothered. Where's your partner?

</BURCH>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I'll call him off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<BURCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The fuck you will. You've got nothing to say to him. He's gone to the ground. Where is he...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURCH>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE. Over the Honor Guard, packing up, we see Scott hand a scrap of paper to Burch, who makes one or two more points, to which Scott nods, submissively. Burch walks off. Camera follows the Honor Guard, down the path, toward Scott, who, passing, nods at them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HOLD on Scott. As he watches the widow, at the gravesite, being walked away to a limo by the pastor. He feels someone behind him and turns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, SCOTT'S POV. A man in a raincoat, standing furtively, half-hidden by a tree, some distance off from the funeral, weeping. He holds a program for the funeral.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE on the man in the raincoat, the funeral beyond him. He is obviously distraught, a rather slight young man in his thirties. He looks at Scott for a moment, and then turns away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE. On Scott. As he turns back to watching the end of the funeral. As the gravediggers begin their work. He sighs. And moves to a bench and sits. Looking at the gravediggers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DUSK. GRAVEYARD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scott, still sitting on the bench. The gravediggers, finishing their work, begin to walk off, joking with one another. Scott stands, and turns, about to start out of the cemetery. He stops for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, HIS POV. The man in the raincoat, who is standing where last seen, looking at the burial. Walks toward the mound of earth, pauses for a moment, and then walks off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BUS STOP. DESERTED, SEMI-INDUSTRIAL AREA, ACROSS FROM THE CEMETERY. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The raincoat man is standing waiting for a bus, at the bus stop, outside a working man's tavern.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, on Scott, looking at the man, still weeping. Scott walks up to the man. Each holds a copy of the program from the funeral. The man looks down at the program, and then up to Scott.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Terrible thing.

The man nods. Beat. He turns back to Scott, looking for sympathy. Anguished.

The man takes out a small photo in a leather case - we see it is a smiling photo of the Secret Service Agent, Gaines.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And all he cared about was doing his duty...that's all...that's all... He used to tell me...

The man begins shaking, and Scott embraces him to comfort him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, INT. THE WORKING MAN'S BAR. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scott and the man, at the end of the bar. A few construction types enter. As Scott bends his head next to the man, speaking low.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>

his way out of the bar)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...driving him..? Did you say "him"?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he reaches out to the effeminate man)
</DIRECTION>
<BURLY_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. It's a man's world, pal - but you're in the wrong bar.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURLY_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
He turns Scott around, and pushes Scott deeper into the room, away from the other man, who is now going out of the door. Scott moves toward him and the Burly Man tries to stop him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scott strikes him several times, and starts toward the door, where, as he exits the bar, he sees the effeminate man, on the bus, and pulling away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scott starts to move toward the bus. There is a hand on his shoulder, and a second man from the bar is whirling Scott to face him. Scott shakes him off and starts after the bus. The second man restrains him.
</DIRECTION>
<SECOND_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...what the fuck did you do to my friend...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECOND_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
In the B.G. We see the first man rise from the sidewalk, and move toward Scott. Scott struggles to follow the bus, when the second man assaults him. Scott is now fighting the two men, who manoeuvre him toward an alley.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Scott's back is to the alley we see a Third Man emerge from the shadows, and throw a garrotte around Scott's neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scott headbutts this man, who hauls Scott off his feet. Scott belts him again, and stomps on his instep. And turns into him. He elbows this man as the other two men advance toward him, in the alleyway. The garrotte man falls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scott kicks the garrotte man in the temple. And draws his pistol. Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The men in the mouth of the alleyway retreat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE. On the street. We see them get into a van which has just pulled up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE on Scott. Standing. Shivering. As he looks around the alleyway. He moves back to the fallen garrotte man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE. Scott standing over the man. He sees something and bends down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE HIS POV. In the man's backpocket is a program from the funeral.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, Scott standing, looking at the program. We hear the phone ringing. Scott puts the phone to his ear.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...where are you...? No. Tell me later. Look: LOOK: Forget the boat house. Look:

	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
Scott stops speaking, and looks down at something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, his POV. Across the street. We see an unmarked sedan pull up and two men get out of the car. And begin to look around. One sees Scott, and motions to the other one, and they both start in his direction. They stop, for a moment, as if confused.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, their POV. The street corner, empty of Scott.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BOSTON STREET. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Copley Square. Scott. Coming into the square.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, the open-air phone stanchion we saw in the earlier sequence. It is festooned, as before, with ads for escort services and phone sex.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, on Scott, getting, hurriedly, out of a taxi cab, on the outskirts of the square.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, his POV, scanning the square for Anton. Scott looks at his watch, and he looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE HIS POV. The figure of Anton, walking from the far side of the square, toward the phone booth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, on Anton, as he looks around him, and then proceeds toward the phone booth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Scott watches, a van pulls into the plaza, and heads toward Anton. Anton sees the van, and retreats, toward the streetside, where we see, the van has herded him toward another car. Three men get out of the car, one slugs Anton, and he is whisked into the car, and the car pulls away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, on Scott, on the far side of the square, looking on, aghast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE Anton, in the backseat of the car, pointing back, as the car disappears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE. CU. Scott, looking at Anton's gesture, and following, looking in the direction in which he was pointing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE Scott's POV. The telephone kiosk. Scott walks into his POV, to the kiosk. He looks down at the pile of trash on the shelf.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up at the various pornographic ads pasted around the interior. He sees that, stuck in one of them is the "Rogers Rangers" card, which Anton showed him earlier. He pulls it out of the ad to which it is stuck. He looks down at it inquisitively. We read in an insert: "Rule #11: Don't ever march home the same way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Take a different route, so you won't be ambushed." He then sees that there is something else behind the ad. He tears the ad off the kiosk partition, and he is rewarded, as a folded envelope falls out from behind the ad. He picks up the envelope. We see that it is the old yellowed envelope from the beach house. It is printed "Hanson Marine - Everything For The Boat", and we see, on it, the drawing of the old power boat. We see Scott feel the envelope, shake it, tear off the end, and pour something out into his hand. We see his face, and then pan down to see the object in the envelope was the red crescent earring seen in all photographs of Laura Newton.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BOATHOUSE, ESSEX. DUSK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A wind is blowing from the sea. Scott turns up the collar of his jacket. We see the house in the BG and Scott, walking along the patio, the sea beyond him. We see him stop and kneel, to the piling, from which he took the matchbook. He sifts through the sand and gravel at the foot of the piling. The wind blows up the dust, and Scott stands, it is evident he has got a speck in his eye, and he tries to extract it, blinking, and squinting. He turns his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, HIS POV. Beyond the property line. Beyond the hedges and on what is obviously the next lot, an old, ramshackle dwelling, the small white toolshed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, Scott, looking at the toolshed, and gauging its proximity to the Essex House. He begins to walk toward it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE. Scott. At the small white toolshed. He stoops, and we see he has picked up the shell, ejected by Anton's rifle. He stands, he takes out a small spotter's scope.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE. HIS POV. His shoulder, rubbing against the pollen- covered window in the small white shed, has uncovered a bit of a sign.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE. Scott, looking at the sign in the window. He rubs the pollen off, and we see emerge, on the inside of the window, drawn in the dust, the Picasso sign %-).

<DIRECTION>
INT. SLEAZY HOTEL ROOM. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scott, wearing just skivvies, is asleep on the bed, an empty pint bottle of booze on the night stand. We hear the television on low, showing talking heads narrating the funeral of Laura Newton.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"Our Redhead, America's Sweetheart", et cetera. We see a photo of her in her signature red crescent earrings. Next to Scott, on the night table, the envelope, holding the same red crescent earring.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, the line of light under the door to the hallway is occupied by a pair of feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE. A hand, dangling off the bed toward the floor. Below it, on the floor, the creased 'Rogers Rangers' card, and several days worth of newspapers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE XCU Scott, on the bed. Unshaven. We see his eyes come open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE on Scott's hand, as it snakes quietly past the Rangers card, on which we read: "Rule #15: Don't sleep past dawn - Dawn's when the French and Indians attack", and comes up with an automatic pistol.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE the door, as we see the door handle move slightly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE on Scott, as he jerks open the door, his pistol at his side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE HIS POV. In the doorway beyond, we see a Bellboy, holding a small paper bag, looking shocked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scott shoves the Bellboy back away from the door, and glances, both ways, down the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<BELLBOY>
<DIRECTION>
(showing the package)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I...I brought you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELLBOY>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why're you screwing with the door...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<BELLBOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I...I...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELLBOY>
<DIRECTION>
Scott drags him into the room.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why're you screwing with the door...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
Scott frisks him roughly. The terrified Bellboy shows a "Do Not Disturb" sign, which he holds.
</DIRECTION>
<BELLBOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I took the...I took the sign off...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You had the sign on the door. F'they saw me...f'they saw me, knocking on a door, the sign on...they'd...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Scott relaxes somewhat.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Bellboy proffers
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
the package)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	An, I...I figured, you needed...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he hands the package
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	to Scott, who takes
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
out a pint bottle of booze)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You told me you wanted this at Ten...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELLBOY>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...yeah. Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<BELLBOY>
<DIRECTION>
(begins to calm down a bit)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I don't know why you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELLBOY>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're right, I'm wrong...I'm wrong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
He begins to look through his pockets. As the Bellboy stands, looking at the television.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE on Scott, the television beyond him. As he goes through the pockets of his jeans. He then goes through the pockets of his jacket, and throws various objects on the bed. Some coins, some scraps of paper. A book of matches, some crumpled cigarettes. He hands some bills to the Bellboy.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There you go, Pal. Hold on...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<BELLBOY>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. I just...I just wanted to help.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELLBOY>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, on Scott. As he rummages through the pile on the bed. The TV shows photos of Laura Newton, wearing her red crescent earrings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scott picks up a cigarette and the book of matches on the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Part of the pile shows a tabloid paper - a photo of Laura, an insert of her father weeping at the funeral, and the caption "Goodbye, Baby". He bends down and picks up the Rogers Rangers card. And looks at it. He shakes his head. As we see the Bellboy leave the room. Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DARK, PANELLED CONFESSIONAL. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
XCU on Scott, as he thinks for a moment, then speaks.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's been...quite a while since my last confession. That...that "transpired". On the rear face of a hill, in a mortar attack.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I confessed that I was frightened.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I have to confess, I'm frightened now.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause. He smiles weakly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Nother "irregular Confession".
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
He raises a shotglass to his lips, and drinks. He makes a "another one" gesture. Pause.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I'm about as frightened as I'm comfortable being.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that's why...I involved you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which, I suppose, was shameful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, as a waiter comes, with a fresh drink. We see that we are in a very dark, quiet, smoky, panelled bar. The waiter leaves, and reveals, beyond him, Jackie Black, the female Sergeant we met at the training facility scenes. The waiter looks at her, inquiring silently, if she wants anything. She shakes her head.
</DIRECTION>
<JACKIE_BLACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now: you did me the honor to Call me. Now: you tell me how I might help.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There in't nobody here, but two people in Green.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scott, looks around, he takes up a tabloid newspaper, which has been resting on the seat of the booth. We see it is a "funeral" edition, concerning the death of Laura Newton.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see the large, color photo of Laura, her red hair, and, in an insert, her father, at the gravesite, hiding his face. The caption reads "Goodbye, Baby". Scott leans over, and whispers to Black, his deepest secret.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing at the paper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...this girl's alive...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<JACKIE_BLACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then, you'd better go get her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACKIE_BLACK>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SANITORIUM. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scott, shaven, neat, and determined, standing at a bus stop. Reading a newspaper. Behind him, a large iron fence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE INS. The newspaper shows "The Tragic Death of Laura Newton", and photos of the accident. And a photo of a distraught woman in sunglasses, being held up by two friends.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE on Scott. As he looks across the street. Surreptitiously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE HIS POV. A plainclothes car, with two people in it, looking vaguely in his direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE on the bus, as it pulls into the stop. We see various people start onto the bus. At the last moment Scott, at the back of the line, sheers away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, INT. THE PLAINCLOTHES CAR. The bus pulling away from the bus stop, the chainlink fence beyond it, and, beyond that, a vaguely institutional-looking Colonial building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SANITORIUM. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A nurses station, Scott moving through the area, just asking directions of an older woman, obviously a semi-invalid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE INT. SANITORIUM. The woman is Mrs. Newton. She walks with a companion, she wears sunglasses, and starts out of the sanitorium. As Scott walks up, some yards behind her, following her out onto a roofed porch. The woman moves to the far end of the porch, obviously weeping. Scott enters the porch, and stands for a moment. Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...terrible thing, grief...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Scott turns to her, to see a lovely woman in her late fifties, sitting on a lounge chair, a robe over her legs, indicating the weeping woman.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scott nods, and takes something from his pocket. He starts toward the weeping woman, but the other woman holds him with her voice.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...you want to comfort them, but you don't know how.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I always think it's better to Leave Them Alone...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Scott nods his acceptance of her wisdom, and begins to start toward the woman.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
(of Mrs. Newton, and the woman, talking to her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A relative?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A psychic.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can we blame her...?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he gestures, meaning,
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	we get comfort where
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
we can find it)
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Scott begins to move toward Mrs. Newton. The woman on the lounge chair sits up.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...who are you...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
(moving off)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	United States Secret Service.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
The woman moves her blanket to reveal a pistol which she holds.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guess again, 'cause I'm the Secret Service, and you follow my directions or I will shoot you dead. Spread your hands to your sides, please...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Scott spreads his hands to his sides)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Open them...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
He opens his hands to show the red crescent earring. We see the demeanor of the woman in back of him change, as she sees the earring. She comes up to Scott, and he turns around. She looks up, asking, mutely, what it means.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SMALL SANITORIUM ROOM. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DONNY>
<DIRECTION>
(sotto, unable to stop her invective)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...the motherfuckers pulled the Detail off of her...He was in town. Her father was in town, they pulled the Secret Service Detail off her, to take him tomcatting. He's been doing it for years. That's what they do. They turn the Secret Service into a bunch of pimps. He took her protection, she got snatched...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNY>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He'd let her die?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
A female Agent knocks at the door and sticks her head in and Donny gestures "rotate".
</DIRECTION>
<FEMALE_AGENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...leaving the post...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEMALE_AGENT>
<DIRECTION>
Donny gestures that she has heard. The Agent leaves and the door is closed.
</DIRECTION>
<DONNY>
<DIRECTION>
(meaning, "this is my surmise")
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The start of a campaign: Your daughter got kidnapped because you were out getting laid?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNY>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Her father would let her die...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who knows if he knows. His 'people' would let her die in a heartbeat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNY>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...her mother...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DONNY>
<DIRECTION>
(pause. She takes up
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	the earring and she begins to weep. She
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
looks beseechingly at Scott)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm her mother...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNY>
<DIRECTION>
She takes out a small, tattered, cheap earring box.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE INS. We see the empty place for holding two earrings, and a small arcade photo of a five-year-old Laura Newton, and this woman, Donny, fifteen years younger. They are hugging. Scott turns over the photo to read, in a childish scrawl, "Donny, you can keep the box, cause I'll never take them off". Donny starts to weep.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need some money.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Donny looks up at him questioningly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to get the girl back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What can I do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNY>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need money. I need a lot of money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DONNY>
<DIRECTION>
(of Mrs. Newton)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been signing her checks for years.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNY>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he scribbles a figure on a napkin)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you go this high, that's what I need...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DONNY>
<DIRECTION>
(as she looks down at the figure on the paper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I...I don't...is there anywhere else you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNY>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE. Both look to the side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, their POV. One of the Secret Service Agents, looking askance at Scott. Does a double-take. And begins to raise his cuff mike to his lips to speak.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, on Donny, as she sees this, and turns around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, her POV. The empty room. Scott vanished.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NEW YORK CITY OFFICE BUILDING. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A very beautiful young woman in a business suit, in an elevator. The doors open and Scott, dressed in a suit, gets in. He turns to face the front. They ride up in silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The doors open on a mezzanine. There are several men at the end of the mezzanine. Scott starts to get out, and the girl tries to stop him. He shoves her roughly back into the elevator. Several of the men come toward Scott, and a large, portly businessman in his forties (AVI) calls them off. Scott comes forward.
</DIRECTION>
<AVI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't they tell you not to come?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AVI>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I guess I wasn't paying attention.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
<AVI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Five years ago they told me you were dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AVI>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to gossip, or you want to do business...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
Avi motions Scott to come with him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, Avi's hitters. One starts to take out a phone - Avi waves him to stop - HOLD on the hitters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, Avi and Scott, as they sit, near the edge of the mezzanine.
</DIRECTION>
<AVI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bobby; this is an American girl...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AVI>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If that were so?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<AVI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If that were so, why don't your people go and fetch her...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AVI>
<DIRECTION>
What if I'm speaking for them...?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Avi nods, meaning "yeah, sure".
</DIRECTION>
<AVI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...they send a hitter to negotiate...?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My question is: have you forgot your catechism...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AVI>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what's the answer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<AVI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The answer is Go Home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AVI>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, that's a good one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<AVI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...you're at the Big Table here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AVI>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know where I am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<AVI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, then, you better talk to me using the Decimal System.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AVI>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your intel. Two men. Infil, exfil, hardware, and com.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<AVI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And com to what? I cannot give you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AVI>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you could, when you where in the Boy Scouts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<AVI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, but I am not in the Boy Scouts anymore. You heard the private sector?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AVI>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<AVI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well. That's where you found me. And here's what it costs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AVI>
<DIRECTION>
He writes a number on a sheet of paper.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
(looks at the paper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...you're out of your mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<AVI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you're out of your fucking mind, and you're out of your league, and my advice to you:...before some mercantile soul shops you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause. In disgust, he
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	picks up the paper, crosses out what we wrote, and puts in a
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
new number)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...for this job, that's what it costs...
	</DIALOGUE>
</AVI>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...that's what it costs...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<AVI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what it costs you.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go home, Bobby.

</AVI>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PALATIAL ESTATE. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see a woman getting into a Range Rover, in the vast gravel drive outside of an estate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A man comes out of the house, with a cup of coffee, hurrying out to kiss his wife goodbye. He does so. She drives off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He finishes the cup of coffee, puts it down outside his door, closes the door, and looks quickly at his watch, and hurries to his Jaguar, which he puts in gear, and it starts down the drive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see it is the Businessman from the whorehouse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE on another car, coming down the drive, which smashes into the Jaguar.
</DIRECTION>

ANGLE on Scott, who gets hurriedly out of the car. He goes out to the Jag, and drags the stunned man from his car, and toward the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE INT. A SUMPTUOUS STUDY, PALATIAL ESTATE. DAY. Beautiful Greek and Roman artifacts line the walls, on lighted shelves. Scott drags the stunned and abraided Businessman into the study. Scott throws him into a chair.

	Remember me...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	now another piece of exquisite statuary,
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
and smashes it to the ground)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And now we're gonna see if you also got all that money that you spoke of.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he takes out a videotape box)
</DIRECTION>

	Yeah, but you haven't made a deal with me...So, today is Your Lucky Day, cause you get to Do, what Most Men only Dream of: You get to make Another Human Being Happy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
He brings over a telephone, and gives it to the Businessman. Scott finds himself behind a large desk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks down at photos of the smiling Businessman, in various poses, with two young girls, obviously his daughters.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
(softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You had your fun, now pay for it, Jim. Get your bank on the phone. We're going to transfer some money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
The Businessman pauses, then picks up the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
(to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	..."how about that".
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<BUSINESSMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. It is. Nonetheless, we tried to match it to a Current Photo...
	</DIALOGUE>
</AVI>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, on Scott, as he looks, questioningly at Avi. Avi takes a photo from his desk and passes it to Scott. It shows, through a long lens, blurry and grainy, a photo of what is obviously the platinum-haired Laura Newton, sitting on a bed, in a barred room.
</DIRECTION>
<AVI>
	<DIALOGUE>

Avi shakes his head, and wags his finger, as if to say, "No, in all sincerity..."

<AVI>

EXT. ROOFTOP, DUBAI. DUSK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scott, on a rooftop, behind a raised elevator housing. Scott takes out a pair of binoculars, and Scott leans around the elevator housing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE HIS POV. Across the way, the window, and the ornate scrollwork bars, in which we, earlier, saw the photo takes on Laura Newton.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE on Scott, as he comes back behind cover, and nods to himself, picking up his yellow bag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE EXT. DUBAI STREET. Scott, walking down the street, beyond him a building with an ornate scrollwork barred gate over its courtyard door. In the courtyard beyond, two Mercedes 600's.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Scott walks past the trelliswork it begins to open. A delivery truck is ushered through the gate, by an armed guard. Scott stops, to let the truck pass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE HIS POV. As he turns his head to the side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE HIS POV. Walking from one outbuilding, across the courtyard, beyond the gate, accompanied by a minder, is Laura Newton. She is obviously drugged, disoriented, and is held up by the guard. He gets into a conversation with a woman, dressed as a matron, who comes out of the building they have just vacated. And she stands, for an instant, untended.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE on Scott, the gate open, as the gate guard ushers through the delivery van, and Laura Newton stands several yards away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE XCU, Laura Newton, as she looks in his direction, and her eyes begin to focus, as if trying to make sense of what she is seeing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, her minder, who reacts to a change in her attitude, and looks at her, and, then, follows the direction of her gaze to the gate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE HIS POV. The delivery truck coming through the gate, as the gate closes behind it. The street beyond it, empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE INT. THE COURTYARD. As the delivery truck pulls in, and Laura, escorted by her guard, is taken back into the main house. She turns to look back, groggily, wonderingly, at the street, and is pushed into the door. As she does so, we see the delivery truck pull up to the spot she just vacated, and the delivery man gets out and opens a rear door, on which we see scrawled, in the dirt, the "Picasso" symbol.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE EXT. DUBAI STREET CORNER. Scott turns the corner, and gets into a car, driven by Jones, which comes to the curb.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE INT. THE CAR. In the backseat, Scott, another man sitting next to him, SMITH, dressed as a construction worker. The man starts to speak. And Scott shushes him, takes out a notebook and a pencil, and begins to make notes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CAR, DUBAI. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A deserted streetcorner. Various shuttered posh shops. Scott walking across the street.

ANGLE CU on Scott, as he paces, as he walks.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...fourteen, fifteen, sixteen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
The camera takes him to the middle of the street. A right- hand turn, a tight corner. He looks to his left.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE HIS POV. Beyond him, we see, several streets off, the sign of the "Royale" hotel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scott beckons, and the man, Smith, comes out of the shadows. He and Scott walk to a small passageway, at the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Camera takes them through the passageway, where we see Jones, standing by his car, in an alley.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>

INT. WAREHOUSE ROOM. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scott, at a desk, looking over his plans. A photo of Laura Newton on his desk. Beyond him Smith and Jones are cleaning and assembling weapons. Scott takes out his switchblade and begins to hone it. Scott looks into the mechanism of the knife. Peers intently, turns it over and raps it on the table. We see a small seed fall out. Smith turns to the sound, and looks inquisitively at Scott.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
(as he picks the seed
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	up, answering Smith's
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
unspoken question)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...it's an appleseed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
Smith nods as if to say,"If you say so".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scott reaches over to a box of Q-Tips, which sits on the table along with other cleansing paraphernalia, and dips one in the solvent bottle, and begins to clean the interior of his switchblade.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE XCU on Scott, as he cleans the interior of his knife. His face freezes...Scott leans over, and gestures at a tweezers as part of Smith's cleaning kit. Smith nods "okay".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE INSERT. The interior of the knife. A small, wafer thin electronic device adhering to the interior.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE on Scott. As he turns his back on the group. We see, in an insert. He holds the electronic device up for scrutiny, in the tweezers. He walks toward the windows of the warehouse.
</DIRECTION>
<SMITH>
<DIRECTION>
(as he cleans his
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	firearms, generally,
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
as if speaking of the universe)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Johnny Appleseed", eh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SMITH>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...yeah, I'm just a Man of Peace...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
We hear a car driving up, outside the warehouse. He looks out of the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, HIS POV. Just seen, the nose of a small SUV, around the corner, three men, getting out of the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE INT. WAREHOUSE DAY. Scott walks into a corridor of the warehouse. He looks down an industrial staircase, and sees the door at the bottom begin to open, stealthily.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, camera takes Scott to a small, filthy bathroom. He opens the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, at the bottom of the stairs, Stoddard, with two henchmen, heavily armed, look up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE THEIR POV. Scott walking into the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, a floor of the warehouse. Stoddard, and his accomplices, coming up the stairs to the floor, which holds Scott. There are several closed doors. One of the men consults a small hand-held 'GPS' unit, and points at one of the doors. The men take up position around this door. Stoddard nods, and they open fire through the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, INT. THE BATHROOM. The men kick down the door, to find the small cubicle-like room empty. One of them looks around, and sees, and removes the small wafer-thin electronic device from the top of the cistern. He shows it to Stoddard, who throws it down in disgust. As he, followed by his men, exit the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE EXT. DUBAI STREET. NIGHT. We see the small SUV parked around the corner from the warehouse, a black clad driver, sitting in the car, watching the warehouse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door is wrenched open, and we see Scott, the small yellow duffle over his shoulder, drag the driver from the car, and clout him to the ground. Scott gets into the car, which begins to drive off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. "MASKALA HOUSE" (THE HOUSE WITH THE ORNATE SCROLLWORK). DUBAI. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, Laura Newton, drugged, listless, sitting on the bed in the small room. We hear a large explosion, and Laura gets up, and moves toward the door of her room. She hears another explosion, and shouts coming from outside her door. She is reaching for the handle of the door, when the door opens, and one of her Bodyguards opens the door, and addresses her.
</DIRECTION>
<BODYGUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...stay in your room, and...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BODYGUARD>
<DIRECTION>
He turns as another explosion is heard, coming from the interior of the house. As he turns we hear glass breaking, and see Scott entering through the window behind Laura.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Bodyguard turns, and Scott raises a silenced pistol, and shoots the Bodyguard twice. The Bodyguard falls, Scott moves to him, and drags him inside the room. He raises his pistol gesturing "shush" to Laura, and moves her toward the window.
</DIRECTION>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...who...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<DIRECTION>
He uses the rope outside the window to improvise a sling, for Laura, and drapes it over her head, and under her arms. Scott picks her up, and holds her for a moment. She starts to speak. And he answers her question.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay by me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
He hesitates for a moment. We hear another explosion, he nods, as if to say "That's what we're waiting for", and passes her out of the window, and begins lowering her to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE EXT. THE BUILDING. Laura, on the rope, reaching the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE INT. THE ROOM. Scott, as he turns to the sound of the door opening, two men come through the door, and he shoots them.

<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...they said they were going to take care of me...

</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're Picasso, right...? That's who you are...

</SCOTT>

He draws the Picasso sign on the windshield, she looks at it, having trouble focusing.

<DIRECTION>
INT. BARE ROOM. DUBAI. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Laura, asleep, at a small cardtable. Out of the window we see an expanse of desert and scrub. Her head is down. Scott enters the room, he moves a chair in front of the door, moves to Laura, and manhandles her to a small cot, and closes the shutters to the window.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I told you to stay on the bed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>

We see her wake and look around, trying to place herself.

</SCOTT>
<LAURA>

<SCOTT>

</SCOTT>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>

</SCOTT>
<LAURA>
<DIRECTION>
(as she tries to light the cigarette)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need a smoke.

</LAURA>
<DIRECTION>
He shushes her, and moves to the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, EXT. The window. The first gleam of dawn. And, far off, a Muezzin is heard chanting morning prayers. Laura moves toward him, unbuttoning her blouse.
</DIRECTION>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could make you give me the smoke.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<DIRECTION>
He slaps her lightly in the face.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep it together.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he takes a small hypodermic kit)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep it together, or I'm gonna give you a shot and carry you out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
She reacts violently to the sight of the needle. Beat. Then, she sits on the bed and cries self-pityingly.
</DIRECTION>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nobody Cares about me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<DIRECTION>
Hold. On Scott. And we take him back to a small shelf near the door. He takes down what we see is an ashtray, overfull with yellow-brown cigarette butts. He takes the ashtray to the small table, takes out his knife, and begins shredding the butts, and gathering the tobacco into a pile.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...that's right...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They sent me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
Scott looks at the pile of tobacco. He extracts the "Rogers Rangers" card from his pocket and looks at it. We read, in an insert: "Rule #13: Every night, you'll be told where to Meet, if Surrounded by Superior Force".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, on Scott, as he very precisely peels the card into two thin halves, and rolls one of the halves into a cigarette, using the reclaimed tobacco from the ashtray. He takes the cigarette to Laura. As a peace offering. She takes it. Beat.

ANGLE, on Scott and Laura, as he walks her out of the hangar, and towards the news bizjet. In the B.G. We see Stoddard, and his men, at their plane. Another car pulls up to Stoddard, disgorging a man, who goes to conference with Stoddard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, these two men.
</DIRECTION>
<SECOND_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
(giving his report)

</SECOND_MAN>
<LAURA>
<DIRECTION>
(groggily, as in a dream)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you know what my mistake was...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
(as he looks around)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...what was that...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
He stops and picks up a pair of "paddles" from their position, leaning against the nose wheel of a plane. They walk on. In the BG we see Stoddard and his crew, searching.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...what was your mistake...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<LAURA>
<DIRECTION>
(from a distance, as
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	she begins to laugh, as at a great private
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
joke; she stops walking)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...you think we bring our troubles on ourselves...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm certain of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
She starts laughing, getting hysterical.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no...come on baby...come on, come on girl: just walk to the plane: Just Get On the Plane...WALK TO THE PLANE...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
She starts to break free and Scott manoeuvres her into a small hangar area. She is struggling mightily. Scott has his hand over her mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE. We see their feet moving through a pool of oil on the concrete floor - we see she loses her footing. We see Scott tighten his grip on her, and is furiously trying to calm her.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shussh, baby... shussh... shussh... it's going to be alright...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
We see him work a small hypodermic kit from the pocket of his jacket. We see Laura see it, and her eyes grow wide.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This's going to make Everything Allright...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
Laura reacts to the hypodermic, which Scott is bringing toward her. And screams.
</DIRECTION>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE HANGAR AREA.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see Stoddard, and his men, about to get into their Jeep, stop, and turn at the sound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE INT. The Hangar Area. Signs all over marked in Arabic and English - "Petrol - No Smoking!!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Scott lunges after Laura, the door, behind her bursts open, and Stoddard and an accomplice enter, placing Laura, in the midst of the hangar, between Stoddard and Scott. Who stands in front of a large tanker labelled "Aviation Gasoline".
</DIRECTION>
<STODDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leave her Alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to his men)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't shoot him, don't shoot, you'll blow the thing sky high...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STODDARD>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Laura...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<STODDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank God we Found you. You know me. I work for Mister Burch. I've met you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STODDARD>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE on Laura, standing between the two men. She is completely confused. She looks from one to another.
</DIRECTION>
<LAURA>
<DIRECTION>
(drugged and groggy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He said that he came to get me...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she shakes her head
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	in disbelief. Then she starts to walk a step toward Scott, then turns, and proceeds
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
toward Stoddard.)
</DIRECTION>
<STODDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right, Laura...Walk away from him. Walk to the Plane...He can't hurt you now. Walk to the plane...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STODDARD>
<DIRECTION>
He points at his bizjet, outside, on the tarmac. Laura walks, unsteadily, in the direction pointed, and we see a female attendant, in a vaguely military getup, get out of the plane, and begin to walk toward Laura.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
(screams)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
He starts toward Laura. And Stoddard and his two men interpose themselves between Scott and Laura, who is approaching the plane. Stoddard's two men approach Scott. One draws a knife.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE on Scott, who hangs his head, wearily. He looks down at his empty hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE on the man with the knife, approaching him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE on Scott, straightening himself, as if submitting to the inevitable, as the man with the knife draws closer. He makes a thrust, and covers. Scott steps toward him and spits at him, full in the face. The man with the knife recoils for a moment, and Scott disarms him, throws him viciously to the concrete floor, and stomps on him. Scott bends to pick up the knife the man has dropped, and turns to face the other man. As he does so, he slips on what we see is a large pool of oil on the floor. He goes down heavily. And the second man steps into him as he falls, drawing his pistol.
</DIRECTION>
<STODDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	DON'T SHOOT, DON'T SHOOT, DON'T SHOOT HIM IN HERE...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STODDARD>
<DIRECTION>
The man uses the pistol to cuff Scott, who is attempting to rise to his knees, behind the ear. Scott falls.
</DIRECTION>
<STODDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cuff 'im...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STODDARD>
<DIRECTION>
The man handcuffs Scott behind his back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE on Scott shaking his head to clear it, as he now struggles to his knees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, his POV. Laura Newton, walking toward the bizjet.
</DIRECTION>
<STODDARD>
<DIRECTION>
(to Scott)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes...well...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STODDARD>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let the girl go home.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
<STODDARD>
<DIRECTION>
(to his henchmen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...wait till she lifts off, take him outside and shoot him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STODDARD>
<SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
(as he speaks he moves,
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	slightly, continuously, to get a better view
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
of the girl)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...why can't the Girl Go Home?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<STODDARD>
<DIRECTION>
(CU)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because she's dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You had to know the Secret Knowledge. Didn't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STODDARD>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is the Secret Knowledge?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<STODDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Secret Knowledge is: There Is No Secret Knowledge.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turns over his
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	shoulder, to look at Laura, walking toward
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
the plane)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You went Beyond What Was Permitted. And the Gods Are Angry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STODDARD>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE. On the tarmac. Laura, walking toward the plane, the petroleum storage hangar behind her. We see a vaguely military uniformed woman fall into step beside her and take her arm. Laura looks at her. We see Laura full face, and just the shoulder of the woman escorting her. Beyond them we hear the engine of the bizjet start up.
</DIRECTION>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I'm so tired.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I'm going to ask you to do Just the One More Thing...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Laura looks at her questioningly.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to ask you, now, to walk away from this plane, and come with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, to show that the stewardess, who descended from the bizjet (the vaguely military clad young woman we saw earlier) is still on station outside of the bizjet, and that the woman who is walking and talking with Laura is Jackie Black, the young female sergeant we met earlier. Laura looks at her uncomprehendingly. Laura begins shaking her head pathetically, and protesting, drawing away from Jackie Black.
</DIRECTION>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No...leave me alone. No - I don't know you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, INT. The Petroleum Hangar. Day.
</DIRECTION>
<STODDARD>
<DIRECTION>
(to his men, as he,
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stoddard, casts a glance outside, and
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
then back)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright, take him outside...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(the henchman hoists Scott to his feet)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, on Laura and Jackie Black. Standing immobile. Laura looks down at something. She then looks up, her face transfixed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, on Jackie Black's hands, she holds the cheap jewelry box we saw earlier, and, in it. The photo of Laura and Donny, and the legend: "Donny you can keep this box, cause I will never take them off."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE XCU, on Laura, as she looks at Jackie, who now moves Laura away from the bizjet, and towards the assemblage of newspeople, who are on the tarmac, around the "global news" jet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, EXT. The Global News Jet. A female reporter, gossiping, with some of her crew, looks over in the direction of Laura and Jackie, and does a double-take.
</DIRECTION>
<FEMALE_REPORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, my God...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEMALE_REPORTER>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, on Stoddard, his man, and Scott. As they leave the hangar. Stoddard looks around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, his POV. Inside the hangar, the fallen man, that Scott has killed. Stoddard goes back inside, to drag this man away. He looks up. And, as he does so, he sees Laura, walking with Jackie Black, toward the Global News Plane.
</DIRECTION>
<STODDARD>
<DIRECTION>
(yells)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STODDARD>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, on Jackie Black and Laura, walking toward the plane, where we see the crew hurriedly setting up a camera.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, on Stoddard, as he draws his pistol, and fires toward Laura and Jackie. We see Jackie move to shield Laura, and then, struck by a bullet, she goes down.
</DIRECTION>
<JACKIE_BLACK>
<DIRECTION>
(to Laura)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep walking...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACKIE_BLACK>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, on Scott, in the grip of Stoddard's henchman.
</DIRECTION>
<HENCHMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(to Stoddard)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...do you want me to...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENCHMAN>
<DIRECTION>
In the moment he is distracted. Scott breaks the man's grip, and his arm. He knees the man, and kicks him to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, INT. The Global Jet. The news crew reacts to the shot. Beyond them we see Jackie, fallen to the tarmac, and Laura, is walking toward the newspeople.
</DIRECTION>
<FEMALE_REPORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gimme an uplink Gimme an uplink... GET IT ON THE SAT. Now Now Now...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEMALE_REPORTER>
<DIRECTION>
Inside the jet we see various monitors, and one switches from an innocuous travelogue, to the scene at the airport, and the caption "Live". We see the shot is taken from inside the plane. We see Laura stumbling toward the bizjet, and see the female reporter run out of the plane, and move her to safety inside the cabin.
</DIRECTION>
<FEMALE_REPORTER>
<DIRECTION>
(to the unseen cameraman)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	On her. On her, get it on the girl...Get us Out of Here...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEMALE_REPORTER>
<DIRECTION>
The camera shifts to the image of Laura Newton, going out live. Behind her we hear the crew shooting commands, and see the door to the Global jet close, as the jet begins to taxi.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, INT. The Petroleum Hangar. We see Stoddard, reloading his pistol. In the BG we see Scott step through his handcuffs, that is, bring them in front of his body. He takes a pistol from the henchman, who is writing on the floor. He raises the pistol and shoots the henchman. He turns on Stoddard.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The girl ain't dead, baby, you're dead. You see: that's the difference.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
He walks toward Stoddard,who is fumbling, trying to reload his pistol.
</DIRECTION>
<STODDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	WAIT: WAIT. The girl's home. You brought her home. Now, listen to me, because I am going to tell you...now, you wanted to be "inside"...I am going to take you as far inside as you can go: Z'at what you want...? Is that what you want?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STODDARD>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I just wanted to bring the girl back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, her POV. Jackie Black, on the tarmac, Scott, kneeling to the fallen Stoddard, and then running out of the hangar toward her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE, on Scott, running, as we see he has the key he has taken from Stoddard, and is releasing his handcuffs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE Jackie Black, bleeding, as Scott kneels to her, and cradles her. Scott looks down. Black is weakening, and obviously expiring.
</DIRECTION>
<JACKIE_BLACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...is she safe?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACKIE_BLACK>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right, she's safe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<JACKIE_BLACK>
<DIRECTION>
(weakly, almost whispering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...well, then...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACKIE_BLACK>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE on Scott, cradling her. Weeping, as he smoothes her hair.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...that's right, Baby...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT.
</DIRECTION>
