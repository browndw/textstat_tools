INT. A BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is dark; we don't see clearly. a man and woman make love on a brass bed. There are mirrors on the walls and ceiling. On a side table, atop a small mirror, lines of cocaine. A tape deck PLAYS the Stones "Sympathy for the Devil."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Atop him... she straddles his chest... her breasts in his face. He cups her breasts. She leans down, kisses him...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOHNNY BOZ is in his late 40's, slim, good-looking. We don't see the woman's face. She has long blonde hair. The CAMERA STAYS BEHIND and to the side of them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She leans close over his face, her tongue in his mouth... she kisses him... she moves her hands up, holds both of his arms above his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She moves higher atop him... she reaches to the side of the bed... a white silk scarf is in her hand... her hips above his face now, moving... slightly, oh-so slightly... his face strains towards her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The scarf in her hand... she ties his hands with it... gently... to the brass bed... his eyes are closed... tighter... lowering hips into his face... lower... over his chest... his navel. The SONG plays.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is inside her... his head arches back... his throat white.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She arches her back... her hips grind... her breasts are high...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her back arches back... back... her head tilts back... she extends her arms... the right arm comes down suddenly... the steel flashes... his throat is white...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He bucks, writhes, bucks, convulses...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It flashes up... it flashes down... and up... and down... and up... and...
</DIRECTION>

EXT. A BROWNSTONE IN PACIFIC HEIGHTS - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Winter in San Francisco cold, foggy. Cop cars everywhere. The lights play through the thick fog. Two Homicide detectives get out of the car, walk into the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK CURRAN is 42. Trim, good-looking, a nice suit; a face urban, edged, shadowed. GUS MORAN is 64. Crew-cut, silver beard, a suit rumpled and shiny, a hat out of the 50'sa face worn and ruined the face of a backwoods philosopher.

INT. NICK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His apartment is very bare -- very few things -- with wide open spaces. There is a lot of chrome.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sits on the couch, reading a book. It is a paperback.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see the title -- Love Hurts, by Catherine Adams. He puts the book down a beat, then picks the phone up, dials.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Page 67, pop. Do you know how she does the boyfriend? With an icepick, in bed, his hands tied with a white silk scarf.

INT. A POLICE DEPARTMENT CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick, Gus, Lt. Walker, Harrigan, Andrews, Captain Talcott -- and Beth Gardner. With them is an older, white-haired man, DR. ANDREW LAMOTT. There are copies of "Love Hurts" around the table.
</DIRECTION>
<LT_WALKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Gardner?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LT_WALKER>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've asked Dr. Lamott to consult with us. This isn't really my turf. Dr. Lamott teaches the psycho- pathology of psychopathic behavior at Stanford and is also a member of the Justice Department's Psychological Profile team. Dr. Lamott?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<DR_LAMOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are two possibilities. One. The person who wrote this book is your murderer and acted out the killing described in ritualistic, literal detail. Two. Someone who wants to do the person who wrote this book harm read the book and enacted the killing described to incriminate the writer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_LAMOTT>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(after a long beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if the writer did it? What are we dealing with?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DR_LAMOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're dealing with a devious, diabolical mind. This book must have been written at least six months, maybe years before it was published. That means the writer planned the crime, at least in the subconscious, back then. The fact that the writer carried it out indicates psychopathic obsessive behavior in terms not only of the killing itself but in terms of applied advance defense mechanism.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_LAMOTT>
<DIRECTION>
A long beat.
</DIRECTION>
<GUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Most times I can't tell shit from shinola, Doc. What was all that you just said?

</DIRECTION>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She anticipates the book to be her best alibi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<DR_LAMOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Correct.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_LAMOTT>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's going to say Do you think I'd be dumb enough to kill anyone in the exact way I've described in my book? I wouldn't do that because I'd know I'd be a suspect.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<DIRECTION>
A long beat -- as they think about it.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if it's not the writer? What if it's someone who read the book?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DR_LAMOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're dealing then with someone so obsessed that he or she is willing to kill an irrelevant and innocent victim to place the blame on the person who wrote this book. We are talking about deep-seated, obsessional hatred; an utter lack of sense of proportion or perspective.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_LAMOTT>
<GUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've got a top-of-the-line, once- in-a-lifetime loony-tune either way you cut it -- that's what you're saying, right, Doc?

Corrigan is reading a file. He gets up, yawns, goes to his window, looks out.
</DIRECTION>
<CORRIGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, you know there's no case here. There's no physical evidence -- okay, she doesn't have an alibi but there's no motive. Her defense would just beat us to death with the copycat thing. Anybody who read the book could have done it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORRIGAN>

EXT. HER HOUSE IN STINSON - DAY

They walk from the car to the door of the big beach house.

They ring the bell. They hear typing inside. The typing stops. She comes to the door in jeans and a tight-fitting sweatshirt.
</DIRECTION>

INT. THE HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is beautifully done in a Santa Fe motif. She goes to a bedroom of the living room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick sits down on a couch facing the bedroom she's walked into. Gus sits across from him, his back to the bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a coffee table between them. She leaves the bedroom door halfway open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An old newspaper is on the coffee table. Nick reaches for it. The headline says VICE COP CLEARED IN TOURIST SHOOTINGS. A headline underneath says GRAND JURY SAYS SHOOTINGS ACCIDENTAL. There is a photograph of Nick.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stares at the paper.
</DIRECTION>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How long will this take?
	</DIALOGUE>

Nick puts the paper down on the coffee table. He is lost in his thoughts. Gus picks the paper up.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Nick, facing the half open bedroom door, sees a mirror near the wall of the bedroom. The mirror reflects her in the other corner of the bedroom. She is taking her clothes off. He stares. She strips down. He sees her back. She has a beautiful body. Naked, she puts a dress on. She doesn't put any underwear on.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you always keep old newspapers around?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
They sit in the front; she is in the back. The car goes over the winding, two-lane Mt. Tamalpais road.

	In the beginning. Then I got to like what he did for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<GUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's pretty cold, ain't it, lady?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUS>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a writer, I use people for what I write. You write what you know. Let the world beware.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
She and Nick have their eyes on each other, then --
</DIRECTION>
<CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Corrigan, smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you like me to take a lie detector test?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE POLICE BUILDING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see her in a glass-enclosed cubicle with a polygraph EXAMINER. Nick stands outside watching her with Gus and Lt. Walker. Her back is to them. The Examiner shuts the machine down, gathers rolls of papers, and comes out of the cubicle.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_EXAMINER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No blips, no blood pressure variations, no pulse variance. Either she's telling the truth or I've never met anyone like her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_EXAMINER>
<DIRECTION>
A long beat, then --
</DIRECTION>
<LT_WALKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I guess that's it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LT_WALKER>
<DIRECTION>
A long beat, Nick watches her as she sits inside.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How does somebody beat this machine?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<THE_EXAMINER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ninety-nine point nine percent of the cases, they don't. You'd have to be able to mask the truth from your own central nervous system, your circulatory system, your adrenal glands. In my opinion, this woman is telling the truth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_EXAMINER>
<DIRECTION>
The Examiner walks away. They stand there. Catherine stands at the door of the cubicle behind them --
</DIRECTION>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I go now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<LT_WALKER>
<DIRECTION>
(after a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Thanks for coming in, Ms. Tramell. I'm sorry to inconvenience you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LT_WALKER>
<DIRECTION>
She says nothing, has a thin smile.
</DIRECTION>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I ask one of you for a ride?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
They look at her a beat.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
And he and Catherine walk away. Gus and Walker watch them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HIS CAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is an old, mint-condition silver Porsche. It is pouring rain; the wind is blowing a San Francisco winter storm. Nothing is said a long beat as he drives. She yawns. Stretches. He looks at her.
</DIRECTION>
<CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm tired.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's got to be tiring to beat that machine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him and looks away. A beat.
</DIRECTION>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I were guilty, and if I wanted to beat that machine, it wouldn't be tiring. It wouldn't be tiring at all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I'm a professional liar. I spend most of my waking hours dwelling on my lies.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For my writing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at her.
</DIRECTION>
<CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love the rain, don't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
He says nothing, doesn't look at her.
</DIRECTION>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You took a polygraph after you shot those two people, didn't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at her now.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I passed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see? We're both innocent, Nick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls up in front of her house on Divisadero, stops. He sees the white Ferrari in the driveway.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you know all this stuff about me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know all about me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know anything that isn't police business.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
(after a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know I don't like to wear any underwear, don't you, Nick?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
They look at each other a beat.
</DIRECTION>
<CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks for the ride.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
And she's out of the car. He watches her as she hurries in the rain -- his eyes on her until the moment she opens the door and is inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE TEN-FOUR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a police bar, San Francisco style. Ferns Joe Montana and Will Clark posters. The jukebox has a lot of Tony Bennett.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks in. He sees Lt. Walker at a back booth with Gus, goes to them, sits down.
</DIRECTION>
<LT_WALKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is all this "Nick" stuff -- Nick would you like a cigarette. Nick can you give me a ride.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LT_WALKER>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She didn't ask me for the ride. She asked anybody.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<LT_WALKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you volunteered.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LT_WALKER>
<DIRECTION>
A BARTENDER stays behind the bar, but yells to him.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_BARTENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perrier, Nick?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_BARTENDER>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Double Black Jack rocks, Harry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<GUS>
<DIRECTION>
(with concern)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What you doin', son?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUS>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's my first drink in three months. That okay with you, pop?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Lt. Walker)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She doesn't know me. I never saw her before Gus and I talked to her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<THE_BARTENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here you go, Nick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_BARTENDER>
<DIRECTION>
He gets up, gets his drink --
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, Harry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
He sits back down. He takes a big slug. They watch him.
</DIRECTION>
<LT_WALKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sure?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LT_WALKER>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
He takes another big slug.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<LT_WALKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What now what? Now nothing. She passed the polygraph. That's it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LT_WALKER>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She knew she could beat it. That's why she asked to take it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<LT_WALKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How the fuck do you know? What is it with you and this broad anyway?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LT_WALKER>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Phil. You're not gonna let this slide. What about her parents? What about what else she's published? At least we should get the stuff to see if we find anything else that's an amazing real-life coincidence.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<LT_WALKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Her parents died in an accident. I don't care what else she's written. What are you -- a book critic?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LT_WALKER>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did they die? Was there an investigation?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<LT_WALKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How you're saying she killed her parents? Did she kill Bobby Vasquez, too?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LT_WALKER>
<GUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not unless she got up in the ring and turned into one mean sonofabitch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUS>
<LT_WALKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe she did, Gus. Maybe she grew herself an Afro and learned a left hook and put shoe polish on her face. Let's polygraph her again and ask her about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LT_WALKER>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(casually)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck you, Phil.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<LT_WALKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck you, too Nick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LT_WALKER>
<DIRECTION>
A beat, then --
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(calls to the Bartender)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you get me another double Black Jack, Harry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Gus looks at him with concern. A man in his 50's -- LT. MARTIN NILSEN is suddenly there. He is overweight, florid.
</DIRECTION>
<NILSEN>
<DIRECTION>
(to Nick)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, shooter -- You back on the Black Jack, Shooter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NILSEN>
<DIRECTION>
He grins. Nick doesn't look at him.
</DIRECTION>
<LT_WALKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're discussing a case, Marty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LT_WALKER>
<NILSEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know that. I had no doubt of that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NILSEN>
<THE_BARTENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here you go, Nick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_BARTENDER>
<DIRECTION>
Nilsen takes the drink, hands it to Nick.
</DIRECTION>
<NILSEN>
<DIRECTION>
(grins)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Double, huh, Shooter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NILSEN>
<DIRECTION>
Nick turns to him. He's sitting in the booth; Nilsen is standing there. Nick looks like he's barely restraining himself.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm off-duty, Nilsen. You hear me? I'm off-duty discussing a case. Internal Affairs shouldn't have any trouble with that. Maybe I should put in for overtime.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<NILSEN>
<DIRECTION>
(grins)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You do that, Shooter. Why don't you send it to me? I'll give it special attention.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NILSEN>
<DIRECTION>
A beat, and then Nick gets up, faces him.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm gonna tell you once more, Nilsen --
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Lt. Walker and Gus get up and hold Nick back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beth Gardner, the police psychologist, is suddenly there.
</DIRECTION>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the problem?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<NILSEN>
<DIRECTION>
(grins)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No problem, Doctor. Here comes the Doctor just in time to save her patient. Take care, Shooter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NILSEN>
<DIRECTION>
And he walks away. Nick still looks like he wants to go after him. Beth pulls him away from the booth.
</DIRECTION>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(after a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<BETH>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't look so okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<DIRECTION>
Nick looks at her a beat.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<BETH>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Baby-sitting.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she shrugs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rookie cop.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What else is new?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. He looks at her again.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to get out of here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him a beat.
</DIRECTION>
<BETH>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<DIRECTION>
At the booth, Gus and Lt. Walker watch the two of them leave.
</DIRECTION>
<GUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe it's for old-time's sake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUS>
<LT_WALKER>
<DIRECTION>
(watches them go out)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sometimes I think he started banging her just to get himself off the hook with Internal Affairs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LT_WALKER>
<GUS>
<DIRECTION>
(after a beat, smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He ain't that way. He's got heart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUS>
<LT_WALKER>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LT_WALKER>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BETH'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is kissing her -- hard, rough. He forces her against the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't -- please, Nick --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<DIRECTION>
We hear her dress RIP. He kisses her harder -- we hear her panties RIP. He gets the dress off, pushes his hands under her bra --
</DIRECTION>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please don't -- don't --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<DIRECTION>
He puts his mouth to her shoulder, bites it -- as they move down to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BETH'S LIVING ROOM - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is dark. The are still partially dressed. They are on the floor. He lies on his back, staring at the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She lies next to him -- the torn dress wound around her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a bite mark on her shoulder. A long beat, silence -- then --
</DIRECTION>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was she like?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Catherine Tramell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(after a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She said what you said she'd say.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
She sits up, looks away. He looks at her, puts his finger on the bite mark idly, gently. A beat, and he kisses her shoulder gently, then lies back down.
</DIRECTION>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I met her at Berkeley.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at her.
</DIRECTION>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We were in some of the same classes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(after a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why didn't you tell me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him.
</DIRECTION>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm telling you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<DIRECTION>
They look at each other a long beat.
</DIRECTION>
<BETH>
<DIRECTION>
(with difficulty)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've never been... like that... before.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<DIRECTION>
He says nothing, looks away from her.
</DIRECTION>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<DIRECTION>
He doesn't look at her a long beat, says nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're the shrink.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
She keeps looking at him. He won't look at her.
</DIRECTION>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You weren't making love to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<DIRECTION>
A beat; he looks at her.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who was I making love to?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him a long beat.
</DIRECTION>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You weren't making love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<DIRECTION>
They look at each other, a long beat, then away. He lies back down. Beth doesn't look at him, keeps sitting up.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(finally)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need a cigarette.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<BETH>
<DIRECTION>
(after a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you quit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<DIRECTION>
He says nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Top drawer in the foyer.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get it on your way out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at her; she won't look at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE DETECTIVE BUREAU - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks in. He looks hung-over. He sees Gus with Harrigan and Andrews and Lt. Walker in Lt. Walker's glass-enclosed office at the end of this big room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They look at him when they see him.
</DIRECTION>
<LT_WALKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You look like dogshit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LT_WALKER>
<GUS>
<DIRECTION>
(grins)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He looks a little shrunk, that's all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUS>
<ANDREWS>
<DIRECTION>
(after a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We got a call from Berkeley P.D. There was a killing. A professor. Icepick. In his bed. Multiple stab wounds. 1977.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDREWS>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(a thin smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She was there, wasn't she?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<LT_WALKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	University records say she was there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LT_WALKER>
<DIRECTION>
He and Nick look at each other a long beat, then --
</DIRECTION>
<LT_WALKER>
<DIRECTION>
(suddenly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gus -- go over to Berkeley. Harrigan -- find out what else she's published. Andrews -- get the files on her parents' accident. Carbon Beth on everything. I want some psychological input on this Andrews and Harrigan go; Nick is left there with Gus.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LT_WALKER>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<GUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're already gettin' psychological input, son.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUS>
<LT_WALKER>
<DIRECTION>
(to Nick)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go stick your head in a tub of ice water.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat; then seriously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See where she leads.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LT_WALKER>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE BEACH HOUSE AT STINSON - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The black Ferrari is in the driveway. He sits in an unmarked police car on a hillside above the house, watching. It is a bleak, leaden gray day.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Catherine comes out of the house. She is dressed casually.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She gets into the Ferrari.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HIS POLICE CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stays behind her at a safe distance on the winding panoramic highway -- a two-lane mountain road which leads from Stinson Beach into Marin County.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She suddenly starts speeding up on this dangerous road, cutting in and out, passing cars very fast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He has to start cutting around cars to keep up. This woman really drives.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He cuts out and can barely pass a car without hitting a Grey Lines Tour Bus head-on. Close call: sheer drops on either side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks frazzled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HIS POLICE CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is behind her at a distance on a hilly Mill Valley road -- little streets, terraced hillsides, sharp turns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He goes slowly, looks around, thinks he's lost her. And then he sees the black Ferrari parked in front of a house obscured by hedges.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He parks the car a distance behind the Ferrari, sits there a long beat. He gets out, goes carefully up to the hedges, looks. A small, nondescript house. He watches. He can't see anything inside the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beat, he reaches over to the mailbox and opens it. He takes an envelope out, looks at the name Hazel Dobkins.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HIS POLICE CAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He watches as she comes out of the house. A frail old woman in her 70's is with her. She hugs the old woman, gets into the Ferrari, STARTS it up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He waits a beat and then STARTS after her. He stays behind her at a distance -- she is going slowly. And then she suddenly GUNS it, cuts her lights -- her wheels SCREECH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He GUNS his car after her. He makes a turn. She is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a fork in the road. He turns one way, goes a few hundred feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing. Blackness. He stops.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HIS POLICE CAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls his car up to her house at Stinson Beach. The black Ferrari is in the driveway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A light goes on in an upstairs bedroom. The curtain is drawn. He sees the outline of her body now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She starts to take her clothes off -- there in the window, behind the curtain. He watches her body as she does an almost languorous strip. His eyes are intense... ravishing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE DETECTIVE BUREAU - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is alone, nobody else in the big room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sits in front of a computer. We see the screen. He has punched in
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HAZEL DOBKINS, WF, 145 ALBION RD., MILL VALLEY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is waiting for a response. We see it come on screen
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NOTHING CURRENT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A long beat, as he stares at the screen, and then we see these words
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RELEASED, SAN QUENTIN, JULY 7, 1965.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see him type in the words
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PRIOR ARREST RECORD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A long beat, and then it comes up
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HOMICIDE, JANUARY 10, 1956 - SAN FRANCISCO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stares at the screen a long beat.
</DIRECTION>
<GUS>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ain't you go nothin' better to do than to come in here and jack off the damn machine?

Nick looks at him a beat.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was she ever suspect?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<GUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, sir. They never even got a statement from her.

Nick sits back a long beat, his eyes off somewhere.

</NICK>
<GUS>

(grins)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hell yes! Couldn't get it outta my head for years. Still can't. Nice little kids -- nice husband, wasn't porkin' around -- no financial problems. One day -- outta the clear blue sky -- she does 'em. All of 'em. Used a knife. He got for a wedding present. Didn't even deny it. Sweet as honey. Said she didn't know why she done it.

Nick just stares at him.

EXT. THE STINSON BEACH HOUSE - NEXT DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls up to the house, gets out of his unmarked police car. He stands there a beat, thinking. He walks down to the beach entrance of the house. He hears a Rolling Stones SONG playing inside. He stands there. The door suddenly opens. Catherine stands there, smiles. She wears very tight-fitting spandex leotards.
</DIRECTION>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at her a beat, then --
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Am I... disturbing you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Come in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
They have their eyes on each other. A beat, and she turns to go in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE STINSON BEACH HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She goes in ahead of him -- he follows her inside. He watches her body. His movements are tentative, off-balance. She turns the Stones DOWN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On a table by the window, he sees a word processor. Spread around it are newspaper clippings. They are all about him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see the headline on one KILLER COP TO FACE POLICE REVIEW. She sees him glancing at the clips.
</DIRECTION>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm using you for my detective. In my book. You don't mind, do you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles. He looks at her, expressionless.
</DIRECTION>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you like a drink? I was just going to have one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, thanks.

</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
She goes to the bar.
</DIRECTION>
<CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right. You're off the Jack Daniels too, aren't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
She is making herself a drink. She takes the ice out and then opens a drawer and gets an icepick. It has a fat wooden end. She uses the icepick on the ice, her back to him. He watches her.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like to ask you some, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>

She turns to him, icepick in hand, smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For my book.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
She turns back to the ice, works on it with the pick. She raises her arm, plunges it. Raises it, plunges it. He watches her.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(wary)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What kind of questions?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
She puts the icepick down, pours herself a drink, turns to him.
</DIRECTION>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How does it feel to kill someone?

He looks at her a long beat.

Their eyes are on each other.

	<DIALOGUE>
	It was an accident. They got in the line of fire.

A long beat, as they look at each other.

BEAT.

<CATHERINE>

	There's a name from the past.

</CATHERINE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want a name from the present? How about Hazel Dobkins?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him a long beat, sips her drink, never takes her eyes off him.
</DIRECTION>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Noah was my counselor in my freshman year.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's probably where I got the idea for the icepick. For my book. Funny how the subconscious works.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Hazel is my friend.

<NICK>

	She wiped out her whole family.

</NICK>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. She's helped me understand homicidal impulse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't you study it in school?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only in theory.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know all about homicidal impulse, don't you, shooter? Not in theory -- in practice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
He stares at her a long beat.
</DIRECTION>
<CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened, Nick? Did you get sucked into it? Did you like it too much?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(after a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>

He stares at her, almost horrified.
</DIRECTION>
<CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me about the coke, Nick. The day you shot those two tourists -- how much coke did you do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
She steps closer to him.
</DIRECTION>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me, Nick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
She puts her hand softly on his cheek, He grabs her hand roughly, holds it.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, you did. They never tested you, did they? But Internal Affairs knew.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
They are face to face. He is still holding her roughly by the hand.
</DIRECTION>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your wife knew, didn't she? She knew what was going on. Nicky got too close to the flame. Nicky liked it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
He twists her arm back behind her -- their bodies are pressed against each other -- their eyes digging into each other.
</DIRECTION>
<CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
(in a whisper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's why she killed herself?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
He is twisting her arm, staring at her, pulling her against him. We hear the DOOR behind them. A beat, and he lets her go, turns away from her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roxy stands there, staring at them. Her hair is up. She wears a black motorcycle jacket, a black T-shirt, and black jeans and cowboy boots.
</DIRECTION>
<CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
(brightly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hiya, hon. You two have met, haven't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
Roxy looks at Nick. Catherine goes to her, kisses her briefly on the lips, stands there with her arm around her --both of them looking at Nick.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks by them, opens the door to go, his face a mask.
</DIRECTION>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're going to make a terrific character, Nick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
He doesn't look at her; he's gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BETH GARDNER'S OFFICE - DAY

He comes in. He looks like he's going to kill someone. A RECEPTIONIST sits there.
</DIRECTION>
<RECEPTIONIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's on the phone -- she'll be right with you, detective --He sweeps by her into Beth's inner office. She hangs up when she sees the look on his face.

She gets up -- he goes closer to her; she backs away from him.
</DIRECTION>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nobody.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<DIRECTION>
He goes closer to her; she backs away.
</DIRECTION>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a confidential psychiatric record, it'd be illegal --She backs into a wall. She looks very scared. He comes very close to her -- puts an arm behind her to the wall.

</BETH>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't, Beth. Don't lie to me.

INT. THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS DIVISION - DAY

He storms into the big room. He sees MARTY NILSEN. He is sitting behind his desk in his glass-enclosed office inside this big room. About a dozen plainclothes policemen are in the big room. He goes by them into Nilsen's office.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MARTIN NILSEN'S OFFICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He closes the door. Nilsen sees the look on his face, backs his chair away towards the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<NILSEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you want, Curran?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NILSEN>
<DIRECTION>
He goes to him, picks him up by his lapels, slams him against the wall.

	You sold her the file, didn't you?

(out of control)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What'd she pay you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
He slams him against the wall again. The glass EXPLODES behind them -- a chair comes into the room. Nick is frozen, holding Nilsen by the throat against the wall.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Let him go, Curran. Nice and easy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ONE_OF_THE_I_A_GUYS>

He looks back, sees two Internal Affairs men with their guns drawn, pointed at him. A beat, and he lets Nilsen go. He turns calmly and starts to walk out.
</DIRECTION>
<NILSEN>

	You're on sick leave, Shooter. As of right now. Pending the outcome of a psychiatric evaluation.

They almost smile at each other, then --

INT. HIS APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sits in front of the TV, watching a lame sitcom. A bottle of Jack Daniels is half-empty in front of him. He is smoking a cigarette.
</DIRECTION>
<BETH>

(behind him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I still have my key.

He keeps watching the sitcom. A long beat.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damnit! Don't shut me out! You owe me more than that?

He goes to the TV, shuts it off.

<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't owe you anything; you don't owe me anything.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We went to bed -- what was it? -- ten or fifteen times?

	It wasn't memorable enough to carry any obligations.

	Sometimes I really hate you.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah? Well why don't you find some friendly therapist and work some of that hostility out.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But take my advice. Put a little more life into it than you usually do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
A beat, and she suddenly hurls herself at him in absolute fury, trying to claw at his face. He grabs her, blocks her. They look at each other a long beat and then he lets her go.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The emotion of the moment is gone now -- they turn away from each other.
</DIRECTION>
<BETH>
<DIRECTION>
(finally)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry... I don't usually... act like that.

Nick looks at her a beat.

<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How could you let him have my file, Beth?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
A long beat, then --
</DIRECTION>
<BETH>
<DIRECTION>
(not looking at him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was going to recommend your discharge a behavioral disability. I made a deal with him. He could review the session notes himself. It was the only way I could keep you on the force.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him. He looks away from her.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You did it for me.

</NICK>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. I care about you. I did it for you.

He goes to the Jack Daniel's, pours some more. She looks at him pour it and turns to go.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HIS APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is asleep on the couch -- the TV is on to a blank screen. The Jack Daniel's is mostly gone. The phone on the coffee table RINGS. It RINGS again. He wakes, picks it up, listens.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.

He hangs it up. He sits there a long beat, staring. He looks disturbed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE ALLEY BEHIND THE TEN-FOUR BAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks down the alley. There are lots of police cars, flashing lights, uniformed men, coroner's men.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he walks down the alley, he sees Lt. Walker, Gus, and several of the Internal Affairs men we saw earlier in Nilsen's office. They are standing around a Lincoln Town Car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They look at him as he comes closer to them -- then move aside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He can see into the car now. Martin Nilsen lies against the front seat. He has been shot in the head. Nick stares.
</DIRECTION>
<GUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One shot. Close range. Probably a .38 caliber revolver.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUS>

Nick stares at Nilsen's body. They watch him.
</DIRECTION>
<LT_WALKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give me your gun, Nick.

	You think I --

He sits in the same room that Catherine sat in --surrounded by four or five Internal Affairs men, Lt.

Walker, Gus, and Captain Talcott. Lt. Walker and Gus sort of sit back -- I.A. is running the investigation. The same police stenographer -- the same plain young woman -- is sitting in the room who was there with Catherine.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. I went after him. I lost my temper.

<DIRECTION>
He walks around the sides, a drink in his hand, looking for her. He doesn't see her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The he catches a glimpse of Roxy. She is dancing with another woman. He watches her. She is wearing pants and a jacket, her hair off to the side. She looks very masculine tonight.

Roxy laughs at the other woman, leaves her on the floor, starts moving through the sea of dancers. He follows her through the press of bodies. She goes towards the men's room. She walks in.
</DIRECTION>

INT. THE MEN'S ROOM

She opens the door to a toilet stall, walks in. Nick is behind her. As the door opens, he sees Catherine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She wears a black motorcycle jacket, a very short skirt, stiletto heels. Her hair is up. He make-up is severe, In the darkness, in the shadows she looks about 19. A hot 19.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hot flash-trash 19.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is in there with two men -- one of them is a big, body- built black guy. She has a vial of something near her face.

She sees Nick watching her. She whispers something to the tall black guy. He looks at Nick, smiles a condescending smile. The door to the stall closes
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE CLUB
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is walking along the side, watching the floor, a drink in his hand. The song ends and it seques right into the Stones's "Miss You."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sees her. Her black leather jacket is off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She wears a very tight, flimsy top, the short skirt, the heels. She is dancing with Roxy and the black guy. He watches her move... watches her body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns, sees him, dances, watches him... gets between Roxy and the black guy... they sandwich her with their bodies... keeps moving, turning... eyes on him... playing to him with her body. He watches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A long beat, and he goes up to them. His movements are
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
almost trance-like. They look at each other. A long beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Catherine stops dancing. he reaches for her. She moves away. A beat their eyes are on each other. She moves a step towards her. A beat, as they look at each other... and they start to move together.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Their eyes are on each other as they move, the eyes burning... the movements tighter, hotter... and he suddenly grabs her and kisses her... as they keep moving... the song seques into the Stones's "Gimme Shelter."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is melting into him now, kissing him... Tex watches, expressionless... the black guy is gone... he holds her by the back of the neck, kissing her... their bodies pressed into each other... his hands are on her butt now, pulling her into him now, almost holding her up now... and then under her skirt, under her panties... as he kisses her neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
People around them stare... he moves his hands under her top as she keeps moving with the song, her head back, her back almost arching... cups her breasts now... she keeps moving... the song sweeping them into its rhythm "it's just a shot away, it's just a kiss away, a kiss away..."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They devour each other. Right there on the floor. Barely able to hold it back. As Tex watches expressionless. As people stop dancing and stare.

<DIRECTION>
The Stones play "Sympathy for the Devil."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Atop him... she leans close over his face, her tongue in his mouth... kneeling over him... she moves his arms above his head... moves higher atop him... her breasts in his face... she reaches over to the side... a white silk scarf is in her hand... she moves higher above him... kneeling over his face... moving oh-so-slightly... his face strains towards her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The scarf in both hands now... she starts to tie his hands with it... his eyes are open, watching her... she ties it loosely, gently... it isn't tight... but his hands are tied to the brass bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She kisses him... moving her hips lower now... over his chest... lower...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And he is inside her... her arms above him... his eyes open... she kisses his neck... bites but not hard... moves... grinding hard against him now.. she is on her knees... head arches back.. her breasts high.. still grinding.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her back arches, strains... he strains toward her... she holds her arms high... she comes out of the arch... shivering... falling over him... the scarf loosens... his arms come forward and hold her close.. closer... closer... as she moves with slight... shivery... movements.

INT. HER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is dark, quiet. Pindrop quiet. He is sitting on the side of the bed, his head down... his back a line tracing of dried blood. She is asleep nest to him, naked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks around the room. The white scarf around the bedpost... the coke on the side-table... clothes all over the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He gets up, walks into the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The light is too bright. He looks at himself in the mirror. He pours the water, lowers his head, puts cold water on his face. A long beat, he comes back up, opens his eyes. Roxy is in the mirror behind him. She startles him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at her in the mirror a long beat, doesn't turn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is expressionless; she wears the same thing she wore at the club.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He lowers down into the basin again, puts more water on his face, comes back up, uses a towel this time, finishes with the towel. She is still looking at him in the mirror the same way. He looks at her in the mirror, doesn't turn.

In its place, a scrawled note "The Beach -- C."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HER STINSON BEACH HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A cold and foggy day. He gets out of his old Porsche, walks down the driveway. He sees her out on the beach by the water. A small bonfire is near her. He walks towards her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roxy watches him, expressionless, from an upstairs window of the house. He doesn't see her.

She looks away.

	<DIALOGUE>
	It doesn't make sense. She didn't know me three months ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<GUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe it wasn't her that paid him. Maybe the money was for somethin' else. How the fuck do I know? I'm just an old city cowboy tryin' not to fall outta his saddle.

</GUS>
<DIRECTION>
Nick looks at him and smiles a thin smile; he's not there, he's completely preoccupied.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. A CAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Someone is following him slowly as he walks down the street. He turns a corner, walks down the alley towards his Porsche, parked behind the country and western bar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car suddenly speeds up -- ROARS down on him from the back, full bore.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE ALLEY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He hurls himself across the Porsche's hood... barely avoiding the car. He sees the car at the end of the alley, turning out It is a black Ferrari.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HIS PORSCHE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He GUNS it down the alley, makes a wild turn in the direction the Ferrari turned.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Porsche dodges around cars very fast, almost side-swiping them, looking almost out of control, its MOTOR screaming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE PORSCHE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sees the Ferrari turn ahead. When he gets to where it turned, he turns wildly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE STREET

<DIRECTION>
The Ferrari is making fast, wild turns into little streets in North Beach, its MOTOR screaming -- the Porsche is gaining ground behind it, making turns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE PORSCHE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Ferrari is up ahead and makes a wild right turn onto a road going up a hillside. He yanks the wheel hard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE STEPS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Porsche rockets up the steps -- bouncing high into the air, almost out of control.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE PORSCHE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As it crests the steps and gets to the street. Nick GUNS it and it looks like it flies high down the hill-side into blackness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But it lands on more steps -- heading downward -- bucking, almost spinning, it bounces onto the next street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE PORSCHE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another set of steps leading up he GUNS it, it rockets up, ROARS, bucking --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

And lands on the next street. Nick makes a wild right turn onto the street. And the black Ferrari appears from around a curve to the right, heading right for him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE PORSCHE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick steps on the GAS and heads head-on for the Ferrari.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Ferrari SCREAMS head-on for him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And at the last moment, in the game of chicken, the Ferrari tries to swerve around him on this narrow road, goes out of control and over the side, turning over and over as it rolls down the hillside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE HILLSIDE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Ferrari has landed right-side up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He runs down the hillside and gets to it. A beat, and he opens the car door.

INT. BETH GARDNER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick with Lt. Walker. Nick looks like a zombie. Andrews comes up to them. He has a gun in his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDREWS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thirty-eight caliber revolver.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDREWS>
<DIRECTION>
Bottom drawer, bureau in the bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<LT_WALKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have ballistics check it for Nilsen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LT_WALKER>
<DIRECTION>
Harrigan comes out.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRIGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lieutenant, you'd better come in here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRIGAN>
<DIRECTION>
Lt. Walker goes into the kitchen. Nick follows him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There are several cops around a kitchen cabinet. A drawer is open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walker looks -- we look with him. We see a copy of Love hurts, Catherine's paperback book, and a stack of photos of Catherine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walker picks the photos up, goes through them -- we see shots of Catherine in college -- Catherine at a fight --Catherine with Johnny Boz -- Catherine with Roxy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He hands the photos to Nick.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick stares at them.
</DIRECTION>
<LT_WALKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess that's it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LT_WALKER>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE DETECTIVE BUREAU - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick sits, his feet up. He looks like a zombie. With him are Lt. Walker, Andrews, and Captain Talcott. We see other plainclothesmen in the b.g. -- a flurry of activity, people on phones. A long beat.
</DIRECTION>
<LT_WALKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She must've heard you on the stairway and dumped the stuff.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LT_WALKER>
<DIRECTION>
Nick says nothing, stares off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A DETECTIVE comes over to them.
</DIRECTION>
<DETECTIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There was no suite 405 in that building. Catherine Tramell's roommate in her freshman year is dead. She died of leukemia two years ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE>
<DIRECTION>
An INTERNAL AFFAIRS MAN comes over to them.
</DIRECTION>
<INTERNAL_AFFAIRS_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our files on Dr. Gardner show nothing about a police report in Berkeley -- nothing related to Salinas, either.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INTERNAL_AFFAIRS_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
A long beat -- the phone RINGS. Andrews picks it up, listens.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDREWS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDREWS>
<DIRECTION>
He hangs up.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDREWS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ballistics says the .38 we found in her apartment matches Nilsen. No registration. They're checking with Salinas. The icepick is the same brand and model as the Boz weapon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDREWS>
<DIRECTION>
A long beat -- Nick just stares.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harrigan comes up to them.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRIGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We checked the tape machines at Dr. Gardner's apartment and at her office -- both here and the one on Van Ness. No message from Gus on any of 'em. The one at her apartment was broken.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Johnny Boz's psychiatrist says he thinks he remembers Dr. Gardner and Boz meeting at a Christmas party at his house a year ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRIGAN>
<DIRECTION>
A long beat.
</DIRECTION>
<LT_WALKER>
<DIRECTION>
(after a long beat, sadly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You just can't tell about people, can you. Even the ones you think you know inside-out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LT_WALKER>
<DIRECTION>
He and Nick look at each other a beat.
</DIRECTION>
<CAPTAIN_TALCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Congratulations, Curran.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN_TALCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
Nick looks at him, expressionless.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HIS APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He parks his car. It is dark. Foggy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He starts heading inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HIS APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He goes in. He starts to walk up the dark stairway, we see him walking up several flights of steps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE CORRIDOR TO HIS APARTMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He opens his door with his key.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HIS APARTMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks in. The apartment is dark.
</DIRECTION>
<A_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(behind him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</A_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
It is a whisper, almost a hiss. He spins, fast. Catherine stands there, pressing herself against a wall. They look at each other a long beat. She looks like she is almost in a trance.
</DIRECTION>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I heard about it... on TV.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at her, expressionless. A long beat, their eyes are into each other. She looks like she is almost shivering.
</DIRECTION>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't allow myself to care about you -- I can't allow myself to care -- I can't -- I can't --
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
She looks very emotional. He moves towards her, puts his arms around her, holds her very close.
</DIRECTION>
<CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
(in a whisper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want to do this -- please -- I don't want to do this -- I lose everybody -- I don't want to lose you -- I don't want to --
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
He presses her closer and closer to himself, holds her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HIS BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is dark; we can't see clearly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Atop her... he makes love to her... gently... tenderly... hardly moving inside her... there are tears in her eyes...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HIS BEDROOM - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Atop him... she is on her knees, straddling him... he is on his back, his eyes are closed... her head arches back... her breasts high... he strains toward her with his body... she holds her arms high... her right hand is in a fist...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(we only see the back of her hand and arm)... it comes down suddenly... he bucks... writhes... then her whole body falls on top of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A very long beat...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We can't see him... her body completely covers him...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then finally he moves... turns her to the side... kisses her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HIS BEDROOM - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Stones play "Sympathy For The Devil" in the b.g.; the MUSIC is low.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They lie next to each other on the bed. The CAMERA faces them. He lies, staring at the ceiling, on the left side of the bed, smoking a cigarette. She is curled away from him toward the right side of the bed. A long beat, then --
</DIRECTION>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do we do now, Nick?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(after a long beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We fuck like minks. We raise rugrats. We live happily ever after.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
We see her right arm go to the side of the bed and then over. He stares at the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hate rugrats.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(after a long beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We fuck like minks. We forget the rugrats. We live happily ever after.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
We see from an ANGLE to the left side of the bed now Her face is expressionless. Her right arm dangles over the right side of the bed. Her right hand is clenched. Is she holding something in it against her arm?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see them from an ANGLE to the left side of the bed now: He turns his body away from her to put out his cigarette.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see her behind him slowly turning towards him and the CAMERA. A beat, and he turns towards her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They look at each other. A long beat as the SONG gets louder. We see them in CLOSEUP. We don't see her right arm.
</DIRECTION>
<CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
(in a whisper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
A beat, and he kisses her. The CAMERA BACKS AWAY from them slowly to the right side of the bedroom as they kiss, and we --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO BLACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... A long beat, as the SONG keeps playing... and we...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE IN:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see them from the right side of the bedroom. And then the CAMERA LOWERS SLOWLY as they kiss with more and more passion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It keeps going LOWER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is something under the bed. The CAMERA MOVES CLOSER towards it as "SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL" plays louder. We see it now in CLOSEUP as the bed rustles above...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a thin, steel-handled icepick.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SONG plays LOUDER and LOUDER, and we --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
