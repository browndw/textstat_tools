:SC: HEAD CREDIT SEQUENCE MYSTERIOUS SEWING ROOM - NIGHT,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HAUNTING LULLABY plays against a black, star-pricked sky when something appears in the distance. A BUTTON-EYED DOLL floats towards CAMERA, through the open window of a small sewing room where it lands in a pair of WAITING HANDS, hands that are made of SEWING NEEDLES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The doll - which resembles a YOUNG BLACK GIRL in old- fashioned clothes, hair fixed with ribbons and braids - is placed on a sewing table. An elaborate sewing kit is opened, and, in flickering green light, the NEEDLE-HANDS go to work. The doll's old clothes are cut away; button- eyes torn off; hair pulled out. The doll's stuffing is removed and then the empty cloth body is pulled inside out, turning from NUT BROWN to PALE PINK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sawdust is poured in the NEW DOLL's mouth; facial features added; blue yarn hair punched in; and then a fresh pair of shiny black button eyes is selected from a button drawer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The transformed doll, in a LITTLE YELLOW RAINCOAT, its new button eyes affixed, is released out the window and

EXT PINK PALACE, ASHLAND OREGON - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDE ANGLE on a rambling old Queen Anne-style house with tacked-on outside stairs. It's late winter, the sky a damp, grey sponge. A SIGN in the foreground reads "Pink Palace, Apartment for Rent".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MR. BOBINSKY - a seven-foot-tall blue-skinned man - performs calisthenics on the rooftop, counting in Russian.

<DIRECTION>
A BEEPING SOUND begins and he pauses. A tired MOVING VAN backs into frame and up the muddy driveway. A VW BEETLE - suitcases roped to its top - recklessly passes the truck and disappears around the side of the house. Bobinsky shakes his fist angrily after the car and shouts:

ANGLE ON moving truck's REAR DOORS as they're wrenched open by two men - MOVER 1, tall and bear-shaped, and MOVER 2, built like a brick top - to reveal a lot of BOXES and BEAT-UP FURNITURE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They haul out the LOADING RAMP towards CAMERA.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE, EXTERIOR STAIRS to BASEMENT FLAT. APRIL SPINK, a rotund little old English lady with bad legs, surveys the MOVERS as they pass by her chair-lift with boxes and furniture. The old gal can't wait to tell her flat mate below about the young, strapping men.

<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON FRONT PORCH. The job finished, Mover 2 heads down the front steps while Mover 1 waits for a signature from the unseen-but-for-his-hands new tenant. Papers signed, a tip of a single, grubby dollar bill is placed in the outstretched hand of the disappointed mover, and the door is shut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT HOUSE, REAR VIEW - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE from BACK YARD. Hiding behind shrubs, WE SHARE the POV of a MYSTERIOUS SPY. With a CLICK, a close-up lens is rotated into place to better see the movers quietly pack into the truck and drive away. A MANGY BLACK CAT walks right in front of the lens and looks at us with concern. OFF-SCREEN, a door bangs open. WE FOLLOW the cat as it races up a tree and out a branch towards the BACK PORCH to investigate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CORALINE JONES, 11, steps onto the porch in a YELLOW RAINCOAT with a shoulder bag. WE - SPY'S POV - CLICK to a CLOSE-UP to find this new tenant has BLUE HAIR and a skeptical face.

<DIRECTION>
NEW Angle, SPY POV. We watch Coraline head towards the WOODY SHRUB we've hidden ourselves in. We DUCK DOWN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE on Coraline, non-spy, shrub by garden gate. She reaches into the shrub and breaks off a FORKED BRANCH. She removes the stick's red leaves, aims it like a DOWSING ROD and heads into the garden.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAM PUSH IN to shrub as the SPY RISES UP, wearing a three- eyed SKELETON MASK on his head and SKELETON GLOVES on his hands. The black cat hops into frame, glances at the spy and follows the girl.

Coraline explores the drained, crumbling pond. She finds an old TURTLE SHELL in the muck and holds it up. After rapping on it to make sure it's empty, she puts the shell into her shoulder bag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON CAROLINE, SPY POV. WE PUSH ASIDE dead vines from the railing of the GARDEN BRIDGE for a better look. Coraline aims her forked stick once more then follows it up from the pond and out the BACK GATE. A gust of WIND blows DEAD LEAVES into a swirling eddy WE TRACK high up into the air.

ROCKY PATH HIGH ABOVE HOUSE - LITTLE LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SPY POV on sky, now dark with GATHERING STORM. Hidden behind a NATURAL WALL OF STONES, WE TILT DOWN to view Coraline crossing frame on a STEEP HILLSIDE path. She steps on an old RAILROAD TIE, and her foot SINKS into the rotted wood, stopping her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE LEAN OUT for a better view, and DISLODGE some stones that roll down past her. WE DUCK as she jerks her head our way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE, non-spy. Unnerved, Coraline calls out.
</DIRECTION>
<CORALINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello?... Who's there?

She throws a rock over the wall of stones, HITS THE UNSEEN SPY, causing a CRY OF PAIN. ANIMAL? HUMAN? Freaked out, she GASPS, runs up the trail.

NEW ANGLE, SPY POV. We rise up to watch and the black cat hops onto the stone wall.

<DIRECTION>
Coraline races down past an OLD TRACTOR and into an ORCHARD. WIND begins to blow.
</DIRECTION>

NEW ANGLE as we move beside Coraline through the old apple trees, where she nearly trips on the tongue of a harvest cart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DOWN ANGLE ON on Coraline as she BACKS INTO a circle of TOADSTOOLS in front of a STUMP. BREATHING HARD, she looks out for her pursuer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE. The black cat shoots past Coraline in the tall grass. She can't see him but she knows something is there. Already behind her now, the cat LEAPS onto the stump with a loud, warning MEROWWW!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STARTLED, Coraline YELLS and whips around. She's both angry and relieved when she sees it's just some cat.

ANGLE ON CORALINE FROM HIGH BLUFF. The SPY moves into frame, astride some kind of MOTOR-BIKE. He presses a button on the handlebars and BLASTS a loud AIR HORN. STARTLED, Coraline SPINS around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UP ANGLE ON SPY. As LIGHTNING FLASHES and THUNDER ROLLS, Coraline sees him for the first time. With his turret- lensed SKULL MASK and SKELETON GLOVES and black FIREMAN'S COAT flapping in the wind, he looks like a PSYCHO KILLER!

He SNATCHES it from her as he passes, KNOCKING HER to the ground. He SIDE-SKIDS his bike, hops off and JUMPS UP onto the stump. Looking TEN FEET TALL from the ground, THUNDER AND LIGHTNING at a peak, the Spy turns his THREE- EYED TURRET LENS and studies her like a predatory alien.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then, the thunder and lightning just FADE OUT and this psycho-killer, three-eyed spy pulls off his mask and Coraline GASPS -- he's just a short kid in a costume.

Shoulders hunched, neck bent, the Spy - real name WYBIE LOVAT - aged 12 - examines Coraline's forked stick, aims it around.

Coraline reacts, hops out of the springy circle. The boy scrapes at the ground, revealing a CIRCULAR COVERING made of WOODEN PLANKS. He wedges a fallen branch under one side, and, using a rock for the fulcrum, pries up the covering.

The main floor kitchen, like most things in the Pink Palace, is barely maintained, and looks worn and faded. Coraline's MOTHER, MEL JONES, 40, bangs away at her laptop on the table, MOVING BOXES stacked nearby. She's plain-looking and tired and wears a NECK-BRACE.

HALLWAY NEAR STAIRS

Coraline pounds down the stairs, spots the carpet bump again in the hallway and jumps on it. A closet door opens, a light on inside, and she goes to investigate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WATER HEATER CLOSET

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is faded and cold with bare windows looking out on rain and gray. The floor is strewn with moving boxes, a few pieces of furniture, Charlie's old Nordic Track. A few garden tools lean against one wall; a cardboard mattress box leans against a corner wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coraline enters, counting windows and doors to note in her pad. She sets the doll on a low table beside an open moving box and smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The box is filled with her mom's collection of SNOWGLOBES. She takes out her favorite - the BEAR FOUNTAIN AT THE DETROIT ZOO - and shakes it. She studies the globe and sighs with homesickness. She sets it carefully on the FIREPLACE MANTEL, then unwraps the rest of the snowglobes and places them beside it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Over the mantel hangs a PAINTING of a CRYING BOY IN BLUE - a scoop of ice cream melting on his shirt, his hand holding an EMPTY CONE. Coraline takes up pad and pen and adds to her list, muttering aloud.
</DIRECTION>
<CORALINE>
	<DIALOGUE>

She shoves the box aside, and discovers the outline of a SMALL DOOR that's been wallpapered over.

<DIRECTION>
-- falls back, washed and dressed for bed, on her pillow. Still raining out. Coraline puts the doll on the chair beside her, then scratches at her wrist. ORIGAMI DRAGONFLIES are strung between the tall, thin bed posts; the TURTLE SHELL she found in the garden sits up on a box, her NIGHT LAMP that projects stars and moons is warming up on the bedside table. Despite her efforts at decorating, Coraline's new bedroom feels small and cold, cracked and faded.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coraline reaches for a framed PHOTO that rests on a toy PRAYING MANTIS by her night lamp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's her TWO BEST FRIENDS from home, posing in the snow by her old school's marquee, its letters rearranged to spell "CORALINE, GOOD BYE!" She touches her friends' faces with her fingertips.

--SURREAL MIST SWIRLS out her window. MOONS AND STARS SLOWLY MOVE across the walls.

<DIRECTION>
SOMETHING in the room goes t-t-t-t-t-t. Coraline sits up, awake. SOMETHING CHITTERS under her bed. She leans over her bedside, head first, peering underneath when a ghost- pale KANGAROO MOUSE JUMPS OUT and bounds out the door.

Coraline enters. The mouse edges out from beneath the sofa, then hops frantically toward the SMALL DOOR behind the wallpaper! Coraline runs and dives, but the door is open a crack, and the mouse escapes.

Coraline grabs the door's edge and pulls it open. Instead of a brick wall, there is a DARK, EXPANDING TUNNEL, with the hopping mouse heading towards a bluish light at the far end.

She looks around, notices the painting over the fireplace: the crying blue boy is now SMILING, his shirt clean and his ice cream back on his cone.

<DIRECTION>
Coraline awakens. She looks around expecting bright colors, a magic dragonfly. But it's just her NORMAL ROOM: moving boxes; cracks in the ceiling -- nothing's changed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She notices the BUTTON-EYED DOLL on the chair where she left it, where the Other Mother was sitting. She picks it up, absentmindedly goes to scratch her wrist. She stops, noticing that the rash on her wrist IS GONE.

It's drizzling and a WHITE FOG has lowered over the house and grounds. Coraline ­ yellow rain poncho, garden SHEARS in hand ­ opens the front door. Stepping out onto the porch, she TRIPS on a big bundle of mail. Annoyed, she picks it up, starts leafing through the envelopes.

She whips around to find MR. Bobinsky - upside down, reaching right at her face! She ducks and he reaches past her to his actual target - his door knob - and pulls it shut. The Russian giant, dressed in a sleeveless T-shirt and shorts, pulls a RAW BEET from his pants. He's not happy.

INT. OTHER BEDROOM - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see Coraline's room, BRIGHTLY LIT LIKE MORNING IN THE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REAL WORLD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON Coraline's face beneath the covers, as she's WOKEN by the light. With a hopeful look, she calls out, pulls back the covers:
</DIRECTION>
<CORALINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mom!... Dad!..
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORALINE>
<DIRECTION>
Her smile turns to shock -- there's a BRIGHT, FULL MOON in her window and it's STILL NIGHTTIME IN THE OTHER

INT. OTHER STAIRS, LOWER HALLWAY - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coraline races downstairs to the Other Living Room where the little door home must be! But the living room is LOCKED TIGHT. She pulls at the handles, plants a foot and tries with all her might! It's no use. She stops, panting, then hears a piano note being hit over and over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OTHER FATHER'S STUDY - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coraline opens the door and finds the Other Father sitting at the piano, his back to her, hitting the note. She speaks in her bravest voice.
</DIRECTION>
<CORALINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey you! Where's the Other Mother? I want to go home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORALINE>
<DIRECTION>
The Other Father turns around. He looks ill; his hair messed and his glasses askew. He speaks, his voice slowed- down.
</DIRECTION>
<OTHER_FATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All will be swell, soon as Mother's refreshed. Her strength is our strength.

The PIANO HANDS pop out again, aggressively SHUT HIS MOUTH and SPIN HIM away from Coraline. Frightened, she runs to the door that leads outside, and pulls it open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OTHER HOUSE - NIGHT, FULL MOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She runs out the back porch, towards the Other Garden.

She crosses the trail, the Other House in the distance.

She runs down the path.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OTHER ORCHARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coraline runs past trees that are LUSH WITH GREEN LEAVES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AND RIPE RED FRUIT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's panting hard, and has to slow to a fast walk. The further she goes, the LESS TREE-LIKE the fruit trees become.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She hears the CAT MEROWWW. Surprised, she looks down.
</DIRECTION>
<CAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what do you think you're doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAT>

The cat trots along by her feet. She blinks.

	Well, I'm gettin' outta here. That's what I'M doing.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh? Something's wrong. Shouldn't the old well be here?

</CORALINE>
<DIRECTION>
The remnants of the trees and the sky and the ground give way to a PALE, EMPTY NOTHINGNESS. No ground or shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<CAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing out here ... it's the empty part of this world. She only made what she knew would impress you.

</CAT>

OTHER HOUSE REAPPEARS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SHAPE RISES in front of them in the whiteness and becomes the beautiful OTHER HOUSE. Coraline and the cat slow, then the front yard and topiary, the sky, hills, white gravel drive and the poplar trees behind them FILL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN.
</DIRECTION>
<CORALINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh? But how can you walk away from something and still come back to it?

The cat curls its tail into a question mark, and tips its head to one side.

Coraline shivers. The cat suddenly TENSES, focuses on a shrub.
</DIRECTION>
<CAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hang on--
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAT>
<DIRECTION>
He bounds towards the shrub and chases out a CUTE KANGAROO MOUSE in uniform with a TINY TRUMPET. Before Coraline can blink, he's PINNED IT DOWN.
</DIRECTION>
<CORALINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop, he's one of the circus mice!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORALINE>
<DIRECTION>
With a SWIFT BLOW of its paw, the cat KNOCKS the mouse into the air, and catches it in his mouth. He gives a QUICK, KILLING BITE - CORALINE GASPS - and the mouse TRANSFORMS into a BIG DEAD RAT. Coraline is stunned. He drops the rat on the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<CAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't like rats at the best of times, but this one was sounding an alarm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAT>
<DIRECTION>
The cat picks the rat up and heads off. Slack-jawed, Coraline speaks with admiration.
</DIRECTION>
<CORALINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gooooood kitty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORALINE>
<DIRECTION>
Coraline looks to the house with a determined look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the porch, she takes out a HEAVY CANE from the UMBRELLA STAND and hits it into her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOUSE, OTHER HALLWAY - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coraline, standing in front of the living room doors, TESTS the cane in her hands, and peers down the hall for danger. It's dead quiet -- no piano, no sounds of anything.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She JAMS the cane through the doors' handles, and PULLS with all her might. One HANDLE AND LOCK BREAK and the door swings open into the pitch black living room. The hall light casts a narrow path directly to the Other Little Door on the far wall, cracked open. She steps into the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OTHER LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A huge ARMOIRE BUG suddenly crab-steps in her path, blocking the little door, and all around her things start to glow. The room has been TRANSFORMED into an amazing BUG MUSEUM, with all sorts of glowing, living specimens in the place of the old furniture and furnishings. The radiators are now big caterpillars, the Nordic Track a serving bug.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Other Mother speaks out, startling Coraline.

A BUG CHAIR scoops up Coraline and brings her to the Other Mother.

The Other Mother takes a candy dish from the servant bug.

<OTHER_MOTHER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're Cocoa Beetles from Zanzibar.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHER_MOTHER>
<DIRECTION>
Coraline is disgusted. The Other Mother takes back the dish and BITES OFF THE HEAD OF ONE. It's the first thing she's eaten in the film.
</DIRECTION>
<CORALINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to be with my real mom and dad. I want you to let me go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORALINE>
<DIRECTION>
The Other Mother FROWNS, swallows. She speaks with a FRIGHTENING STEELINESS in her voice.
</DIRECTION>
<OTHER_MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that any way to talk to your mother?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHER_MOTHER>
<DIRECTION>
Coraline is mad, and feeling mad makes her brave.
</DIRECTION>
<CORALINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You aren't my mother.

</CORALINE>
<DIRECTION>
The Other Mother STRAIGHTENS. Her button eyes, now DEAD, stare into Coraline's.
</DIRECTION>
<OTHER_MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Apologize at once, Coraline!

	</DIALOGUE>
</TALL_OTHER_MOTHER>
<DIRECTION>
She PULLS HER HEAD OUT and leaves Coraline in DARKNESS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coraline pounds on the mirror-door, kicks it with her blue boots. A SOB wells up in her throat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then we hear a SOFT GHOSTLY MOAN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns. She can just make out a sagging iron bed. When the voice speaks, there is a faint glow from beneath its stained cover.
</DIRECTION>
<CORALINE>

She gently pulls back the sheets.

The boy, dressed like Huck Finn, CONJURES up ghost flowers.

The strange-looking flowers wither and fade. He's so sad that Coraline takes his cold hand and squeezes it.

The ghosts fall back into their bed and sink down. Coraline is stunned. She thinks a little and then speaks, trying to steady her voice.
</DIRECTION>
<CORALINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, she can't keep me in the dark forever; not if she wants to win my life. Beating her is my only chance.

A beat. Then the Sweet Girl asks in her sing-song way:

<SWEET_GIRL_GHOST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps, if you do win your escape, you could find our eyes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWEET_GIRL_GHOST>
<CORALINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Has she taken those, too?

The ghosts PULSE with hope. Coraline sits down against the mirror door, bounces her head against it. She's not hopeless.

She grabs his hand, stops him.

	Not in a million years. But it wouldn't matter; she can't escape without her eyes. None of the ghosts can.
	</DIALOGUE>

Wybie stares at her, nodding his head as if he understands her crazy story. He changes the subject, gets back to his mission.

Miss Spink is knitting a SWEATER WITH WINGS for a worried- looking ANGUS, one of the Scotties, who sits on her lap.

Coraline sips tea, anxious, the other two DOGS beside her.

Miss Spink suddenly RAISES her KNITTING NEEDLES as if to STAB CORALINE. Coraline yelps, hands up in defense. But it's CANDIES she attacks, sending sticky chips flying, making loud grunts as she stabs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls a LARGE, THREE-SIDED CANDY WITH A HOLE IT from the rubble and passes it to Coraline.
</DIRECTION>
<MISS_SPINK>

Coraline can't take anymore. She gets up, takes the odd piece of candy and leaves.

INT. PARENT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coraline, dressed for bed with her blanket over her shoulder, walks into her parent's room, the PHOTO of her and her parents at the Bear Fountain in the foreground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls down the bed covers and builds COPIES of her parents out of pillows. She fits an extra neck brace on one pillow head and some reading glasses on the other. Then Coraline lies down and pulls up the covers, very sad.
</DIRECTION>

Coraline, asleep. SOMETHING blurs past camera. One paw and then two paws bat her nose. She opens her eyes to find OPAL BLUE EYES staring at her. It's the BLACK CAT, purring loudly.
</DIRECTION>
<CORALINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello. How did you get in?

The cat blinks. Then he heads out the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOWER HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She follows him, wrapped in her blanket, to the MIRROR at the end of the hallway. The mirror starts to GLOW and then an IMAGE FORMS within the glass. It's HER PARENTS! They cling together, blue with cold, as snow falls.
</DIRECTION>
<CORALINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	MOM! DAD!!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They look up and, with a desperate look, Mel BREATHES on the inside mirror-glass to fog it. She writes H E L P U S. ­ her fingertip squeaking on the glass like a SMALL, SAD BIRD. Frost RISES UP, hiding the letters and then her parents. The image fades.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coraline STRIKES AT THE MIRROR as hard as she can. GLASS SHATTERS and she drops to the ground, shaking. The cat nuzzles her..

Coraline and cat watch until the fire burns out. She takes a breath and looks up at the mantel.

ANGLE ON snowglobe, the one of the FOUNTAIN BEARS from the Detroit Zoo. Coraline cradles it, remembering.

<DIRECTION>
Series of quick shots of Coraline getting ready to go. Pulls her collecting bag from the closet, her puffy vest, her boots; grabs a candle and garden shears, puts them in the bag. She stands to go, taking her cap off the chair. The ODD PIECE OF CANDY, the triangle green one with the hole, drops to the floor. She hesitates a moment, then sticks it in her bag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear the click of the door being unlocked. It opens to reveal the cat, and - holding a lit candle - Coraline. She leaves the key in the lock, like always, takes a breath and crawls forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The candle casts huge, flickering shadows along the wall. The cat, his voice returned, SPEAKS to her.

	You know, you're walking right into her trap.

A moment later, a HUGE RAT skitters out of the tunnel - FILLED AGAIN with spider webs and children's things - carrying the KEY from the real world door.

At the table's center, Coraline sees the box with her BUTTON EYES with needle and thread. A bead of sweat rolls down her forehead. As casually as she can, she asks:

EXT. OTHER GARDEN - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coraline walks through the gates. The bright magic of the garden is DARKER NOW, with areas of black against areas of glowing flowers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She passes the PITCHER PLANTS, and the one with the frog suddenly SWALLOWS the animal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She goes up the steps past the BLEEDING HEARTS, which now LEAK STICKY RED JUICE that runs down the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the top, a few SNAPDRAGONS, feeble now, SNAP at her. She KICKS them down. Behind her, a brick tree ring OPENS like a monster's MOUTH and five HUGE, PALE SNAPDRAGONS sneak towards her. They ATTACK, knock her to the ground, spilling her bag.

Coraline is just able to GRAB her GARDEN SHEARS. She CUTS OFF one mutant snapdragon's head, then another, until she is free. The HEADLESS STEMS retreat into the rock mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coraline, winded, goes to gather her spilled things when a trio of HUMMINGBIRDS/WASP HYBRIDS SWOOP IN. They don't attack her; instead they poke their long beaks into the TRIANGLE CANDY WITH THE HOLE and LIFT OFF.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PIANO HANDS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HEADLIGHTS GLARE and the tractor ROARS TO LIFE. The mechanical hands FORCE Other Father to SHIFT GEARS, and the tractor LURCHES at Coraline, its arms SLASHING. She yells, backs away. Other Father calls in a garbled voice:

Coraline looks past the greyed garden towards the Other House. A LUNAR ECLIPSE has begun, the full moon a pale acid green.

Coraline looks concerned, then resolved, and then she heads towards the house. A haunting version of Spink and Forcible's show song starts to play...

WE SEE her flickering shadow and then Coraline appears behind the entry curtains. She steps close, pulls the curtain open. Song stops.

<DIRECTION>
POV ON THEATER, quiet and dark save for light coming through entry curtains. She spots usher's FLASHLIGHT on the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON CORALINE - she picks it up, clicks it on, and STEPS FORWARD. She sweeps the light beam around, apprehensive, then HEARS SOMETHING overhead. She aims flashlight up and startles a NEST OF BAT-DOGS - half Scotties/half bats. One bares his teeth and GROWLS. She clicks off the light and shivers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On stage, one spotlight and footlights FADE UP on a huge, wrapped SALTWATER TAFFY. It hangs from ropes and sandbags.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She cautiously climbs up onto the stage. A HUMAN-SIZED TAFFY THING - striped pale pink and green - can just be seen through the wrapper. She holds her TRIANGLE CANDY- WITH-HOLE to her eye. There is a BLUE-WHITE GLOW coming from inside the wrapper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coraline PUNCHES A HOLE through the paper, steels herself, then reaches inside. She touches something sticky and cold and inhuman. Clenching her teeth, she grabs hold and pulls out two clasped-together COLD, TAFFY HANDS - Young Spink and Forcible's.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her heart thumps. She PRIES the TAFFY HANDS open like scallop shells until a large PEARL-on-a-ring is revealed.

Bat-dogs are closing on the left, the taffy monster on the right! She waits to the very last second, and then
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DIVES OUT OF THE WAY!

BAT-DOGS AND TAFFY MONSTER COLLIDE! Coraline's hand is released by the taffy hands, leaving her the PEARL. The bat-dogs and taffy monster - stuck together and still-as- stone - turn to dead, grey ash, as does the stage and theater.

RATS leap from COAT SLEEVES and PANT LEGS, Coraline pulls back, HORRIFIED, as the clothes collapse, scanning around for the circus ball.

The Beldam leans close, knowing Coraline is wrong, and speaks very quietly.
</DIRECTION>
<BELDAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, they are, are they?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELDAM>
<DIRECTION>
A smile creeps onto her terrible face. And she STARTS TOWARDS THE LITTLE DOOR, moving in an odd, laboring way, as if she had four legs instead of two. She signals the armoire bug to stand aside, her back to Coraline.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coraline hears the soft chirp of her mother's finger on wet glass! Looks around, desperate - where is it coming from?!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cat's ears twitch and focus, and then he SEES SOMETHING on the mantel!. He whispers to Coraline --
</DIRECTION>
<CAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There!

</CAT>
<DIRECTION>
-- and JUMPS to land beside the DETROIT ZOO SNOW-GLOBE -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OPAQUE WITH FROST.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
C.U. ON SNOW-GLOBE. With a SOFT-CHIRP, a section of glass is WIPED CLEAR from inside by a TINY FOREARM - and we see the tiny, cold figures that are CORALINE'S TRAPPED PARENTS! Coraline's heart races. She purposely stays back from them.

She grins at Coraline and speaks in a low, sing-song voice.
</DIRECTION>
<BELDAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're wrong, Coraline!

</BELDAM>
<DIRECTION>
She opens the little door, revealing the empty, spider- web tunnel.

And she HURLS THE CAT at the Beldam. The YOWLING ANIMAL - face shocked with surprise - SAILS through the air and lands RIGHT ON THE ASTONISHED WITCH'S HEAD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FREAKED-OUT, the cat DIGS in his CLAWS AND BITES the shrieking Beldam, who STAGGERS to one side of the little door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coraline GRABS the SNOW GLOBE with her parents inside, stows it in her bag, and moves out to approach the door from the other side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Beldam FLAILS WILDLY at the cat. The cat HOWLS LIKE A BANSHEE, RAISES HIS CLAWS, and - quick as you can - TWO

<DIRECTION>
She furiously STOMPS the floor which FLIES UP in a spiral of floorboards that drive Coraline to the room's center. A huge WEB TRAP LIES BENEATH THE FLOOR!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The web trap STRETCHES DOWN into a FIFTY FOOT DEEP PIT. There is nothing beyond but PALE NOTHINGNESS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cat scrambles along the tops of falling furniture straight to the little door and disappears into the tunnel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coraline falls the very bottom of the web.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fifty feet above, the Beldam LAUGHS MANIACALLY and LEAPS DOWN like a huge, flying spider!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coraline manages to pull herself to the outside of the trap JUST AS THE BELDAM LANDS.

<DIRECTION>
The witch - furious her prey has escaped - spins around, grasping blindly.

Coraline, nearing the top, looks up and spots the LITTLE DOOR, still in the corner wall of the Other Living Room. She goes to climb back inside the web, when her bag GETS CAUGHT on a barb. She pulls and pulls until it breaks free, sending a STRONG VIBRATION DOWN THE SPIRALING WEB

<DIRECTION>
BELDAM'S HEAD THRUSTS INSIDE.
</DIRECTION>
<BELDAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... DISOBEY YOUR MOTHER??!!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Coraline KICKS HER IN THE FACE, knocking her back. The cat takes off down the tunnel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coraline nearly shuts the door, when NEEDLE FINGERS GRAB HOLD THROUGH THE CRACK. The door STARTS TO PULL OPEN!
</DIRECTION>
<CORALINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	PLEASE...SHUT!!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The ghost children's FLUTTERY, DISMEMBERED HANDS FLY OUT FROM HER BAG and GRAB HOLD OF CORALINE'S HANDS that grip the door's handle. And her STRENGTH IS QUADRUPLED.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door STARTS TO SHUT. The Beldam SNATCHES DESPERATELY at Coraline, reaching through the closing gap with one thin claw. There's a final moment of resistance - the Beldam's wire-thin wrist caught in the door - and then SNAP! The DOOR SHUTS, and the Beldam's hand drops to the ground!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She SCREECHES like a metal rake on pavement!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coraline just manages to lock the door in the dark when it is POUNDED from the other side, green light coming through cracks! She takes off down the tunnel, stooped down, as fast as she can.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pounding grows more insistent, green light flashing.

And then the tunnel behind coraline STARTS TO GROW SHORTER, like a collapsing accordion and the pounding far door with the blind, one-handed Beldam on the other side
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STARTS TO CATCH UP TO HER!

Ahead, DAYLIGHT APPEARS, and then the LITTLE DOOR TO THE

REAL WORLD!

INT. REAL LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coraline FLINGS HERSELF through the doorway, SHUTS AND LOCKS THE DOOR and BRACES HERSELF AGAINST IT. A split- second later, the OTHER WORLD DOOR CATCHES UP WITH A CRASH! Coraline is THROWN BACK. But the real-world door and lock, hold. It's over...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coraline lies on her back, as beat-up and tired as she's ever been, GULPING in breaths of air till her heart slows a little. The room is brightly lit by sunlight, the first since she moved here, and the sky out the windows is blue with white clouds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles, remembering, and turns to her bag with the ghost eyes and snow globe with her parents inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She opens it up, and searches, shoving aside ghost eyes and garden shears. But the snow globe is GONE!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She gets on all fours, starts searching the floor. Her hand hits a small PUDDLE by the fireplace, with tiny bits of BLUE SNOW. A drip plops down, then another. She looks up to the mantel and spots the MISSING SNOW GLOBE. She stands up and finds that it's BROKEN OPEN, and neither her parents or the fountain bears are inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the last of the snowy liquid drains from the globe, Coraline's face clouds with confusion and fear: What does this mean and where are her parents? Then her WONDERFULLY REAL MOTHER calls to her.

Coraline sits in bed -- pajamas washed and PATCHED, wounds-dressed, hair shining. The KEY hangs from a string around her neck. A gibbous moon shines in the clear night sky.

Charlie wrestles with a blue stuffed-toy squid like it's an alien face-hugger then, FEIGNING DEATH, falls on the bed. Coraline LAUGHS.

Coraline exhales with relief then picks him up and carries him over to her bed.

Circling around behind the BIG STUMP, the HAND SCAMPERS behind one rock to a bush to a tree, coming closer.

<DIRECTION>
Coraline manages to lever the well's cover off to one side, leaving the WHOLE WELL OPEN. Huffing and sweating, she wipes her brow, then takes the key string that's around her neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hand, SEEING what is about to happen, RACES TOWARDS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HER!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coraline lifts string and key, not quite over her head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hand JUMPS onto the big stump and SPRINGS through the air to GRAB THE KEY and PULL CORALINE TO THE GROUND!

Coraline makes a CHOKED SCREAM, her fingers caught between the key string and her neck!

The HAND wants to DRAG HER BACK TO THE HOUSE and the

He CIRCLES AROUND and HEADS TOWARDS THE WELL, readying to throw the hand in. But the HAND GETS FREE, and GRABS his handlebars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUT OF CONTROL, Wybie's bike HITS A ROCK, and WYBIE AND HAND ARE THROWN RIGHT DOWN THE WELL. HOLLERING, he just manages to hang on with one hand! The Beldam's hand, caught on Wybie's coattail, SCRAMBLES UP his body and face and onto the well's edge where it STABS AT HIS FINGERS to make him fall!

Coraline, choking, rises to her feet. She grabs her BLANKET and - in the still-blazing headlight of the crashed bike - she RUNS UP and THROWS IT OVER THE HAND. It fights like crazy as Coraline wrestles to control it. The hand STABS THROUGH THE BLANKET and SHAKES IT OFF. It crouches to attack her!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then WYBIE IS BACK, pumped with adrenaline, a BIG ROCK raised over his head! He HURLS IT DOWN ON THE LEAPING HAND! And it BREAKS into TWENTY LIFELESS NEEDLES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wybie struggles to catch his breath. Coraline - breathing hard - removes the key and string from around her sore neck. She pulls up the corners of her blanket - with the needles on it - around the rock, and ties it all together with the string. The key is left attached.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two friends carry the heavy package to the well and DROP IT DOWN THE HOLE. By the light of a stray moonbeam, they watch and listen until it makes a muffled splash in the dark water at the bottom. They slide the well cover in place.

Still catching his breath, Wybie stands, holding his injured hand, its glove ripped by the Beldam's claw. He looks over at Coraline as the scene brightens a little with moonlight.

The BLACK CAT jumps up on the TREE STUMP and MEROWWS. Coraline smiles.

CAMERA PULLS UP from the GARDEN, FLIES OVER THE HOUSE and BOOMS DOWN to the PINK PALACE APARTMENTS SIGN out front. On top of the sign sits the black cat, who looks right into camera, blinks, then walks behind the thin post that holds the sign and DISAPPEARS.
