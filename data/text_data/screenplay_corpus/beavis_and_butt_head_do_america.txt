:SC: "BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD DO AMERICA"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The movie begins with scenes of people screaming in horror and running down the streets of a big city. The ground shakes from what seems like giant footsteps. There are pieces of building debris falling everywhere, people getting crushed, power lines coming down, etc. - complete pandemonium. It all looks very much like a Japanese animated King-Kong or Godzilla movie. We hear the footsteps getting closer and the ground shaking becomes more intense - more debris falling. Then we see a HUGE BLACK TENNIS SHOE come into frame and smash a National Guard truck. As we pan up, we see the white socks, then the red shorts, the AC/DC T- shirt, then we hear the familiar, "Huh huh huh." - only it's a huge sound...this is a THREE-HUNDRED FOOT TALL BUTT-HEAD. "Butt- Kong" continues his path of destruction - stomping on cars and buildings and saying, "This is cool. Huh huh huh." Airplanes and tanks start firing at Butt-Head (Butt-Kong). He looks irritated and says, "Cut it out butt-munch!" Butt-Head swats at the planes, sending them crashing to the ground and stomps on the tanks. Then, something catches his eye. Butt-Head reaches into a skyscraper and picks up a nice looking woman - a lot like the one from the King Kong movie. He looks down at her in his hand and goes wide-eyed, "Whoa! Huh huh huh." The woman screams in terror as Butt-Head looks down at her and tries a few lame pick up lines. "Uuuuh...Hey baby. I'm like, pretty tall. Huh huh huh." He swats down a helicopter that is circling his head, "Dammit, I'm trying to score!" The helicopter goes down in flames. We CUT TO some guys sitting on a tank firing at him. They notice giant footsteps coming from the other direction and turn the tank around. Through their binoculars we see a THREE-HUNDRED FOOT BEAVIS coming from the horizon. The giant Beavis is even more destructive than Butt-Kong (maybe he could be breathing fire). Beavis starts trying to pick up on Butt-Head's woman. Butt-Head puts the woman down and he and Beavis begin to go at it, leveling the city with one of their stupid juvenile smack-fights.

Out the window, we see two YOUNG MEN carrying B&B's TV into their van.

Still on the couch, Butt-Head looks over at the broken window. We see a CROWBAR lying on the floor, and the front door left open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Butt-Head looks at the BROKEN WINDOW, at the CROWBAR, the OPEN DOOR, then back at the EMPTY SPACE where the TV was. He does this a couple of times - piecing it all together.

Tammy moves forward, leaving Butt-Head standing there. In the background, we see Beavis starting to quake, on the verge of Cornholio mode.

</DIRECTION>
<BEAVIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bargarajjjaaaahhh!!! I am Cornholio!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEAVIS>

The pilots SCREAM. The copilot jumps up so fast he causes coffee to spill everywhere, including on the captain's lap. The captain then jumps up, hitting the controls and SENDING THE PLANE INTO A NOSE-DIVE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON BUTT-HEAD
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
MONTAGE SONG BEGINS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Note: I would like this to be a well-known band (Red Hot Chili Peppers) doing their best imitation of a modern Las Vegas lounge act. I think a song like "What Am I Gonna Do With You" by Barry White or something obnoxious like "Bicostal" by Peter Allan would be cool. Or maybe Sinatra's "You Make Me Feel So Young" would be best.

The car passes by major hotels and tourist sights, finally pulling up to a big luxurious hotel and casino.

BUTT-HEAD'S VISION. Through time-lapse dissolves we see him sitting on his couch with Beavis, laughing like an idiot in the exact same positions at age 2, 5, 7, 10, 13.

	Uh... I think I'm seeing something too. It's like a really long time ago...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEAVIS>
<DIRECTION>
BEAVIS' VISION: Beavis as a sperm cell swimming through a uterus. It's a sperm cell with the face of Beavis on it.
</DIRECTION>

BEAVIS' P.O.V. OF BUTT-HEAD: His face starts to warp and colors start shifting.
</DIRECTION>
<BEAVIS>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and... Whoa!...and it's like there's all these weird shapes and it's sort of like,...it's like...like a MUSIC VIDEO!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEAVIS>
<DIRECTION>
Tight on Beavis' face staring in wonder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THIS IS WHERE THE MUSIC VIDEO/HALLUCINATION SEQUENCE BEGINS. It could even be so shameless as to actually have a chyron in the lower left hand corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
I would like to have a band (White Zombie?) do a version of something like, "Fire," by The Crazy World of Arthur Brown. This is the song that begins, "I am God of Hellfire and I bring you... fire!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The concept of this will depend somewhat on which band we get, but I would like to see it get pretty wild and surreal. (If it's White Zombie, we could incorporate some of Rob Zombie's artwork.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEAVIS' P.O.V.:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see the sun above the horizon turn into a giant ball of fire. The ball of fire develops a face and speaks.
</DIRECTION>
<FIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am God of Hellfire and I bring you...
	</DIALOGUE>

</FIRE>
<BEAVIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa!!! This kicks ass!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEAVIS>
<DIRECTION>
THIS IS THE GREATEST VIDEO BEAVIS HAS EVER SEEN. Out of the ball of fire steps a beautiful woman in a bikini.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At first the video is mostly the God of Hellfire, chicks in bikinis and various images of B&B's TV in all its glory.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the video/hallucination continues, it becomes a psychotic mass of naked people, fire, TVs, vultures, B&B head-banging, weird stuff from my high school notebooks, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At one point we see the God of Hellfire in a Burger World uniform.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the song winds down, we incorporate Muddy's car into the surreal imagery. (We should also incorporate their TV, as well as maybe some of the characters from the show that aren't in the movie.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, we REVEAL Muddy's car actually pulling up to B&B's near-dead bodies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SONG ENDS as Muddy tosses water on B&B. REVEAL they were not far from the side of a road all along.
</DIRECTION>
<B_B>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ahhhhghhhhgh!
