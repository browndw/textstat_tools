The great atom sub glides past camera, but now, as we are shooting from her stern over the bow, we see the screws halt, then go into reverse, and she begins to back away, back TOWARD CAMERA. Then, in the b.g., we see the saucer, the great, eerie 'eye' or whatever it is, looming like a searchlight on her top, and the oval shape seeming like a great mass of glowing energy. The saucer is easily overtaking the reversed Sturgeon, when:

INT. WAR ROOM - DAY - MATTE SHOT - EST. SHOT

This room is, more than anything else, a system of maps and charts - a huge detail of the Arctic ocean occupy- ing an entire wall behind the conference table. On it are small, magnetic models of submarines, defense stations, etc. Also, to one side, is a huge globe of the world, on a revolving stand. File cabinets, rolled maps and charts, shelves of references, navigation guides, etc. All business; no time wasted on decora- tion. There is an electric lock on the door; no one can 'burst in' on the excuse of making a mistake.

CLOSE SHOT - ADMIRAL TERHUNE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The burly, grim-faced Admiral, in uniform, is at the head of the conference table. There is an intercom on a small stand beside his position at the table. The Admiral has a sheaf of reports and photographs, also a stack of mimeographed 'briefs' at his elbow. No nonsense; Terhune speaks in clipped, brief phrases, almost as if he has digested sentences down to short, terse bursts before 'releasing' them from his lips. The Admiralts lips are moving as we first see him, but we do not hear his speech until the Narrator is finished.
</DIRECTION>
<NARRATOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Admiral Terhune, in charge of the Arctic Theater for the Joint Chiefs, well knew the effect the 'leak' of any of the explosive information would have on the world civilian population. So the Admiral was determined: There would be no leaks!

LIEUTENANT DAVE MILBURN, ex-Naval Academy halfback and inter-collegiate boxing champion, hard-nosed and trigger-tempered, is reluctantly taking leave from Reef's party. His pretty, placid wife, HELEN, is indeavoring to get him through the open door and cut his 'farewell scene' short. Dave is slightly, but not objectionably, high. REEF HOLLOWAY, a handsome, capable, relaxed Annapolis-type, is smiling amiably and bantering with Dave, all the while trying to usher him out with determined speed. But it is not easy to get Dave through the door. He is chattering constantly, in a lecturing tone, to someone inside the apartment o.s.

In a deep, torried kiss on the couch. Eyes closed, they enthusiastically plumb the depths of feeling, then, at last, reluctantly, they break apart. Julie sighs deeply. Reef shakes his head, like a boxer who has sustained a knockout punch, trying to clear it. CAMERA PULLS BACK for MED. TWO. Julie, unable to speak for a moment, throws a quick look at Reef, who seems to be gulping for air, then she reaches for a cigarette from a box on the coffee table. She drops two or three as she fumbles for one and finally gets it in her mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reef picks up a table lighter, strikes it, holds it to her cigarette. But his arm is trembling so he cannot hold it steady. Finally, Julie grasps his wrist, holds the flame steady, then contrives to bring the tip of the cigarette in contact with it. She leans back, takes a deep drag, only now dares to speak.

Carl reacts to this. The shot, for the first time, has struck home. But then, just as he opens his mouth to say something, there is a TREMENDOUS, RATTLING CRASH...as if

This is a wild extravaganza. The radar pattern is jumbled, overlaid with a half-dozen wave-forms. The dials and lights flicker and glow with utter insanity.

It seems to be buffeted by an underwater storm. The scene is lit by underwater lightning bolts, crashes like exploding skyrockets, the sub is tossed about like a chip. Finally, when it seems that nothing can survive the electrical barrage, we see the nose tilt down steeply, and the Shark glides deeper and deeper into the depths. CAMERA HOLDS as it goes below frame.

This is a discussion group, or 'seminar' - and in the group are Sir Ian, Carl, Reef, Dave and Wendover. Sir Ian leans back, holding the pencil, while his sketch is passed around from one to the next. With a faintly amused expression, Sir Ian murmurs thoughtfully:

SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE SAUCER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now the luminous eye seems to turn to observe the ap- proaching menace. There is a THROBBING BUZZ as of an energy discharge, and then the first torpedo comes in scene, seems to swerve to avoid the Cyclops, goes plunging on past it and o.s.
</DIRECTION>

There is an AD LIB response of shock. Then Wendover complains to Reef:

SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE SAUCER - CLOSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now, from some vent within the vehicle, a cloud of radi- ant, luminescent 'jelly' seems to stream out, enveloping it in a protective cloud. Just as the cloud is well- formed about the saucer, obscuring its outlines...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - CLOSE ON SECOND TORPEDO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It plunges through scene and off towards the saucer.
</DIRECTION>

SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - AT SAUCER

as the second torpedo burrows into the protective cloud, more and more slowly, probing vainly toward the still- visible 'eye.' Then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - CLOSE ON TORPEDO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as it buries itself in the mass of luminescent jelly. The propellers thrash madly, ineffectually. Then, gradually, they slow down, and the torpedo is completely surrounded by the mysterious mass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

(with grim purpose)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

There are AD LIB surprised exclamations from all. Reef is incredulous:

</REEF>
<WENDOVER>

	That's what I said!

</REEF>
<WENDOVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can ram him!

</WENDOVER>
<DIRECTION>
The others exchange quick, frightened looks. Dave is incredulous. Carl moves over to Wendover, admonishes quietly:
</DIRECTION>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've weighed the consequences, Captain - the lives involved?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARL>
<DIRECTION>
Reef glares at him.
</DIRECTION>
<WENDOVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doctor -- I've weighed the lives Cyclops has taken, already...and will take, in the future, unless we can stop him, now!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WENDOVER>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We might find other means...

Now it begins to rise slowly from its bed in the depths. Water pours from the ballast tanks. Then, with the boat floating free in the water...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - CLOSE SHOT - SCREWS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as they begin to churn, picking up speed, then, finally, churn the water into a foamy wake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE TIGER SHARK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Like a great, predatory fish, it rises from the bottom, moving more and more swiftly. It makes a great climbing turn directly TOWARD CAMERA, then goes overhead and out, speeding toward the saucer.

He adjusts the TV view screen, tenses for the shock. Reef appears just behind him. They exchange a grim look, then eye the screen, fascinated.

SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - SAUCER AND TIGER SHARK

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER CUTS - TIGER SHARK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
plowing into the protective jelly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FULL SHOT - THE CRASH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the Tiger Shark, unstoppable, plows inexorably through the protective coating, slams against the saucer itself,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
then buries its bow deep within the Cyclops - like a har- poon driving into a huge creature of the depths. Perhaps a third of the Shark's length is driven deep into the saucer. Tremendous RENDING, TEARING NOISES accompany the crash, after which...complete, eerie silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER CUTS - THE CRASH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the bow rends the outer envelope of the saucer, the screws of the Tiger Shark churn powerfully against the restraining jelly...then a CLOSE SHOT of the Cyclops' 'eye' shows the glow diminishing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY - SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - OVER DAVE'S SHOULDER - AT TV SCREEN

And we see the situation, that the nose of the Shark is buried deep within the saucer.

	<DIALOGUE>
	At our declination angle, running in reverse, they're pulling the Shark and Cyclops right to the bottom.

<DIRECTION>
SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - CYCLOPS AND SHARK

<DIRECTION>
Present are Wendover, Carl, Reef, Kent, Sir Ian and Dave. This is a grim, hopeless conclave. The silence, except for a faint trickle of water somewhere, is complete, eerie, ghastly. Faces are bathed in tense perspiration. Wendover shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<WENDOVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If anyone has any more ideas... I'll try anything, before just lying here, waiting to die!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WENDOVER>
<DIRECTION>
Now Reef explains an idea he has been toying with:
</DIRECTION>
<REEF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Suppose there's an atmosphere, of some kind, inside Cyclops?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REEF>
<WENDOVER>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WENDOVER>
<REEF>
<DIRECTION>
(to the group)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If we could get inside the saucer - use our torches - maybe we could cut the Shark loose?

<SIR_IAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's all very fine, young man. But how would one go about get- ting inside Cyclops?

Reef takes a deep breath, throws a glance at Carl, then says:
</DIRECTION>
<REEF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Through the eye - with the Depth-Explorer!
	</DIALOGUE>
</REEF>
<DIRECTION>
Carl seizes this eagerly.
</DIRECTION>
<CARL>

	Yes - the Explorer was built to operate at even greater depths --

</CARL>
<WENDOVER>
<DIRECTION>

</WENDOVER>
<REEF>
<DIRECTION>
(bluntly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then the idea's no good. But we're no worse off than we are right now.

Dave picks this up eagerly.

</REEF>
<DIRECTION>
Carl bridles angrily.
</DIRECTION>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's enough, Holloway. I've told you before, wearing boards on your shoulders, and parading with a stiff spine doesn't auto- matically endow you with back- bone - !

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get the Explorer in the airlock, ready for launching.

</WENDOVER>
<DIRECTION>
Carl nods. Throwing a final look at Reef, he goes to the passage way, climbs down. Wendover turns back to Reef, suggests:
</DIRECTION>
<WENDOVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You better take Powell and Carney with you --

Wendover holds out his hands, shakes both theirs. Reef turns to Dave.
</DIRECTION>
<REEF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's get ready.

<DIRECTION>
They head for the passage way and exit. Wendover looks at Sir Ian and Kent, shakes his head solemnly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TORPEDO ROOM - DAY - FULL SHOT - AT AIRLOCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see the single hatch open, in which the Depth Explorer has been mounted. Carl, in a jumper and helmet, waits by the step with Powell and Carney, dressed in their rubber suits, with helmets and face plates. They carry breathing apparatus. Behind them, Dave and Reef appear, dressed similarly, carrying their equipment - portable torches, a bag of tools, sidearms, flare pistols, and... in Dave's case...a machine pistol (burp gun). Over this:
</DIRECTION>
<NARRATOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Preparations consumed only an hour. At 1100, everything was ready for this last, desperate attempt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NARRATOR>
<DIRECTION>
Now the four men join Carl at the airlock. Carl is tense, tight-lipped. Reef frowns, concerned.
</DIRECTION>
<REEF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's still time. You could show me how...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REEF>
<DIRECTION>
Carl shakes his head firmly, gestures toward the hatch.
</DIRECTION>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARL>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO COVER

the action of the five men climbing down hatch (into Explorer). When all are inside, Griff steps forward, closes the hatch. Then he closes the airlock, and goes to intercom.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ready to open Airlock door, Captain!

Now we see the lock door slide open. A moment later, the Depth-Explorer moves out through the opening, like an animal being born. It hovers for a moment, just below the Shark. Then it maneuvers o.s. towards the Cyclops.

Now the Depth-Explorer moves into frame, drifts directly toward the great 'eye' - which still has a faint glow.

The Depth-Explorer moves up with its hatch clamped magnetically, directly over the eye.

The others all apply oxygen tubes to their mouths, go down hatch, Reef picking up a large tool like a wrecking bar.

They come down ramp section to chamber, stop, and look off screen.

As he works, a weird SOUND OSCILLATION - varying wildly in pitch - sweeps over scene. Reef reacts, startled. The SOUND COMES AGAIN, and Reef turns, calls sharply:

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The black, catfish-or-sea urchin-like spines seem to rise from limp supineness. They stiffen, grope like fingers, move towards a series of grommet-like openings in the translucent wall of the sphere. Now a spine nears a grommet, slips into it, apparently making 'contact', for somewhere, a FAINT LIGHT comes on, and the scene becomes lighter. In a moment, another spine slips into another grommet-hole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHAMBER SECTION - DAY - MED. SHOT - A LIGHT

They come clambering down the ramp, reach the platform level. Then, awed, they look around them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EST. SHOT ON FLOOR (PLATFORM) - CAVERNOUS INTERIOR - BACK AT TINY MEN ON PLATFORM - MATTE SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see a long, slender bridge, or catwalk, extending out into space, apparently reaching toward a great, opalescent sphere that seems to hang suspended on cushioning points, some sort of shock-absorbing system, in the very center of the saucer. A weird GLOW, seem- ing to become ever brighter, emanates from inside this sphere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO SHOT - DAVE AND REEF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Awed, round-eyed, silent, they stare open-mouthed at the sight. But before they can make any comment...

But Reef is too intent on the voice. Now he begins dis- arming as Dave looks incredulous.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVE>

	What're you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVE>
<DIRECTION>
MATTE SHOT - FROM THEIR P.O.V. - TOWARD GLOBE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now, at the very tip of the spine-bridge, an IRIS OPENING appears in the side of the sphere.
</DIRECTION>
<SAUCER_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To me - here!

</SAUCER_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
TWO SHOT - REEF AND DAVE

Reef has a distant look as he hands his weapons to Dave.

Reef moves o.s. toward the bridge. Dave waits, very unwillingly.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He inches his way tortuously across the slender support, toward the iris opening.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He crawls cautiously towards the opening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PLATFORM - BLACK BACKING - DAY - CLOSE SHOT - DAVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Angry, impatient, he sets Reef's weapons down. Then he clutches his submachine gun, watches Reef o.s.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SPHERE - DAY - MED. SHOT - FROM INSIDE - IRIS OPENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now Reef appears, crawls cautiously up into the opening, then stands, looks inside. His eyes nearly start from his head as he takes in the incredible sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRICK SHOT - FROM REEF'S P.O.V. - INTERIOR OF SPHERE - SPECIAL EFFECTS SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes range over the ceiling of the glove, then as he shifts his gaze to the bottom of the sphere, we see 'it' - a horrendous organism, like a giant sea urchin, the long, black, writhing spines now all in proper contact
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
with their grommet-sockets. And out of the center of the pulsating central 'body' rises a long stalk, and on the very tip of it a great, glowing 'eye.' The setup is like a monstrous rendering of the eye of a snail.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MATTE SHOT - UP PAST 'EYE' AT REEF IN IRIS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
So he appears a tiny, miniature man compared to the cavernous size of the sphere. And now, apparently from the 'eye' itself, which seems to flicker and glow like an electron beam spectrometer, comes the saucer-voice again:
</DIRECTION>
<SAUCER_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, Commander Holloway - as you Earth inhabitants would express it - we meet 'face to face.'

(Note: From here on, in speech with the saucer, Reef's lips do not move - his responses, except to Dave, are all 'voice over')
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SECTION OF BRIDGE - DAY - DOWN SHOT - PANNING WITH DAVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He cannot contain himself any longer, is now crawling out onto the bridge, toward Reef; cradling the sub- machine gun on his forearm as he goes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SPHERE - DAY - MATTE SHOT - UP PAST 'EYE' - AT REEF IN IRIS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The conversation continues:
</DIRECTION>
<SAUCER_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My mission is to study various solar systems, and planets - select the most suitable for colonization -
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAUCER_VOICE>
<REEF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	- for horrors like yourself?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REEF>
<SAUCER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course. It may interest you to know I have visited hundreds of other worlds, and of all of them, your Earth seems most suit- able.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAUCER>
<REEF>
<DIRECTION>
(drily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Swell!

<DIRECTION>
(sternly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your friend was to remain where he was!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAUCER_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - REEF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks a bit bewildered:
</DIRECTION>
<REEF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He did!
	</DIALOGUE>
</REEF>
<SAUCER_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am afraid not. Therefore -
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAUCER_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Now, to Reef's consternation, Dave suddenly appears be- side him:
</DIRECTION>
<REEF>
<DIRECTION>
(to Dave, lip sync)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dave - !
	</DIALOGUE>
</REEF>
<DAVE>
<DIRECTION>
(grimly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's goin' on in here, Lad? What - ?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVE>
<DIRECTION>
Then, Dave's mouth drops open, and he stares, incredulous.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MATTE SHOT - AS BEFORE - DAVE'S P.O.V. - THE CREATURE
</DIRECTION>
<SAUCER_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(warningly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stand away from him, Commander!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAUCER_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
TWO SHOT - DAVE AND REEF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Dave, before Reef can stop him, steps forward belligerently, levels and submachine gun down at the creature.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVE>
<DIRECTION>
(menacingly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So this is 'headquarters,' huh? Well, you've sunk your last ship, you....
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVE>
<DIRECTION>
And he looses a burst with the sub-machine gun, so that we don't hear the appropriate name.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - DAVE - PRODUCTION SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a BOOM of tympany, a LIGHT STRIKES Dave, and suddenly he is melted, shrivelled to nothingness. The machine gun falls o.s.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO COVER - THIS ACTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - REEF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he looks on, shocked, sobered, shaken. Then, in his thought-voice, he asks slowly:
</DIRECTION>
<REEF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not me? What am I - the closing act?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REEF>
<SAUCER_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	On the contrary. I want you - unharmed - perfect.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAUCER_VOICE>
<REEF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REEF>
<SAUCER_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have selected you, to return with me - along with several other specimens, for study. We will examine you and the others, discover desirable features to incorporate in our 'earth-colonizers.'

</SAUCER_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
MATTE SHOT - REEF'S P.O.V. - THE ORGANISM
</DIRECTION>
<REEF_O_S>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then you just...'build them in?'
	</DIALOGUE>
</REEF_O_S>
<SAUCER_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course. Evolution is much too slow a process.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAUCER_VOICE>
<SAUCER_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	On earth you build with inanimate material. We employ living tissue. This space vehicle, for example...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAUCER_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO COVER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. CLOSE SHOT - REEF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Awed, frightened, he looks about him at the construction of the chamber in which he is standing.
</DIRECTION>
<SAUCER_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is a living thing. When damaged - you would say 'wounded' - it immediately 'heals' itself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAUCER_VOICE>
<REEF>
<DIRECTION>
(understanding)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REEF>
<SAUCER_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course. But it is time to be- gin the return voyage --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAUCER_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - REEF'S HAND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And we see it creep up under his coat, grabbing the Very pistol.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. CLOSE SHOT - REEF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as he says grimly, threateningly:
</DIRECTION>
<REEF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To navigate, won't you have to... see your way?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REEF>
<SAUCER_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Obviously.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAUCER_VOICE>
<REEF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That might be a little rough!
	</DIALOGUE>
</REEF>
<DIRECTION>
And Reef raises the Very pistol, fires.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE 'EYE' OF THE ORGANISM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the flare strikes it and bursts. There is a SCREAM, an unearthly, shattering WAIL from the organism itself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - CLOSE ON 'EYE'
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the flare burns a hole in the iris, and the water, or whatever it contains, seems to drain from it, like a plastic bag when it is torn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - REEF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reacts quickly, astonished at the effect of his shot. But then he wastes no time - turns and scrambles back out. SCREAMS OF PAIN from the creature follow him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SECTION OF BRIDGE - DAY - FAST PAN - WITH REEF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heedless of the danger of falling, he scrambles madly back across the bridge. Beams of the death-dealing light just miss him as he goes, and SCREAMS from the wounded creature shatter the cavernous silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PANNING WITH REEF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches the platform, races madly for the ramp. Beams of light again just miss him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PANNING WITH REEF - UP RAMP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And suddenly, as he reaches the iris, he YELLS with pain, his foot caught in the iris.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT - CLOSEUP - REEF'S FOOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he pulls his foot clear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PANNING WITH REEF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he runs through the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PANNING WITH REEF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As a beam of LIGHT just misses him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP - STEAM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As steam comes out of the darkness at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PANNING WITH REEF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he runs by, the steam just missing him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE PAN - REEF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he races for the iris at the end of the ramp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DEPTH-EXPLORER - DAY - AT HATCH WINDOW - OVER CARL'S SHOULDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carl reacts as the iris begins closing. Quickly, he grabs a crowbar, or other prop, wedges it into the iris, holding it open momentarily. A moment later, Reef literally hurls himself into the little sub, slams the hatch behind him, and exclaims:
</DIRECTION>
<REEF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Back to the Shark - right now!
	</DIALOGUE>
</REEF>
<DIRECTION>
Carl does not hesitate, begins working the controls.
</DIRECTION>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about Dave - and the others?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARL>
<REEF>
<DIRECTION>
(grimly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Fortunes of War!'
	</DIALOGUE>
</REEF>
<DIRECTION>
Carl frowns. Now Reef grasps the radio microphone, says quickly:
</DIRECTION>
<REEF>
<DIRECTION>
(into mike)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is Reef, Skipper -- in the Depth-Explorer. Don't wait for us - start engines, and pull loose!
	</DIALOGUE>
</REEF>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY - FULL SHOT - THE ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Wendover nods, responding to the radio message.
</DIRECTION>
<WENDOVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, Reef.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WENDOVER>
<DIRECTION>
He turns to the intercom, orders:
</DIRECTION>
<WENDOVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Reactor Room! This is the Skipper! I want all reverse full-emergency power!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WENDOVER>
<DIRECTION>
SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE TIGER SHARK PROPELLERS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They begin to turn, slowly at first, then picking up speed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - SHARK AND DEPTH-EXPLORER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It moves away from the saucer, back up through the water to the belly of the Shark, at the airlock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOWER CHAMBER OF SAUCER - DAY - SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - CLOSE ON 'EYE'
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And now we see, through a SERIES OF DISSOLVES that the eye is healing - restoring itself, like a balloon being blown up (maybe this would do it).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE 'FINGERS'
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Purposefully they probe into the 'circuit' apertures, and the power lights begin to glow radiantly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FORWARD TORPEDO ROOM - DAY - FULL SHOT - AT AIRLOCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Griff superintends preparations to open the lock door, the men from the control room - Wendover, Kent and Sir Ian, hasten in. Now Griff cracks the hatch on the lock door, and in a moment, Reef staggers out, then helps Carl from the Explorer. Wendover frowns, glances inside:
</DIRECTION>
<WENDOVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about --- ?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WENDOVER>
<DIRECTION>
Reef only shakes his head. Faces are tense, then Reef declares bitterly:
</DIRECTION>
<REEF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We didn't kill it, Skipper. And if it ever gets...back where it came from...the Earth is doomed, and everything and everybody on it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</REEF>
<DIRECTION>
SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - TIGER SHARK AND SAUCER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And now, the mighty engines of the Shark succeed - the bow of the Shark pulls out of the hull of the saucer, and the two vehicles float freely in the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FORWARD TORPEDO ROOM - DAY - GROUP SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The scene JUMPS AND LURCHES. Then there is an exultant voice:
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(over intercom)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've pulled loose, Skipper! We're free!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Wendover and Reef exchange an exultant look. Then they turn and run out toward the ladder to the con. Kent, Carl and Sir Ian follow more slowly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY - FULL SHOT - THE ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Wendover and Reef come scrambling up the ladder and through the hatch, the man at the helm indicates the TV screen. Wendover and Reef peer eagerly at it. Wendover smiles tightly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - OPTICAL SHOT - THE TV SCREEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And we see the saucer floating loose in the water. But, suddenly, with a tremendous burst of speed, the saucer moves away through the water, so rapidly as almost to become a blur.
</DIRECTION>
<REEF>
<DIRECTION>
(o.s.) (despairingly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There it goes!
	</DIALOGUE>
</REEF>
<DIRECTION>
UP INTO FACES OF REEF AND WENDOVER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Reef adjusts the dials of the screen, and Carl, Kent and Sir Ian appear behind them.
</DIRECTION>
<REEF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Straight to the Pole - at almost fifty knots!
	</DIALOGUE>
</REEF>
<WENDOVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing we can do, now.

</WENDOVER>
<KENT>

	Excuse me, Captain - there may be one last, desperate chance - a one-in-a-thousand shot...

(desperately)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Anything ---

	It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.

And as they AD LIB orders and instructions, Kent and Sir Ian and Carl climb back down the hatch to go to work.

SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE TIGER SHARK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is rising to the surface, under the ice. And now, as it nears the surface, a BEAM OF LIGHT, like a search- light, hits it, and the water becomes brighter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY - MED. CLOSE SHOT - WENDOVER AND REEF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Reef, at the navigator's position, sings out:
</DIRECTION>
<REEF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right under our hole in the ice, Skipper.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REEF>
<DIRECTION>
SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - DOWN ON ICE - SEEN ON TV SCREEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see a round, black hole of open water in the ice field.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY - CLOSE SHOT - WENDOVER AND REEF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Wendover glues his eye toward the screen.

Wendover sets a knob on the screen, peers at it again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - OPTICAL SHOT - POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All we see is fields of ice and snow. Finally the cross- hairs stop exactly at minus three.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. SHOT

<DIRECTION>
as Wendover gestures toward the controls.
</DIRECTION>
<WENDOVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take over here, Reef.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WENDOVER>
<DIRECTION>
Reef nods, looks at TV screen. Wendover moves to the intercom, barks:
</DIRECTION>
<WENDOVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Prepare ICBM for firing!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WENDOVER>
<DIRECTION>
Then he murmurs to Reef:
</DIRECTION>
<WENDOVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, that's all we can do -- until our space-friend decides to blast-off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WENDOVER>
<DIRECTION>
SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE TIGER SHARK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And now, on the bow, we see the mighty ICBM lift from a recess on the deck, in front of the conning tower. It stands on end in its cradle, ready.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IPE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY - MED. TWO SHOT - REEF AND WENDOVER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reef's eyes on screen. Wendover waits tensely. Now Reef reacts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - OPTICAL SHOT - THROUGH SCREEN - THE ICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, a phenomena like an undersea volcano rising. The ice rends and cracks, rises in a great bulge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE ICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It breaks up, boils, tremendous rending, tearing NOISES. Then, from the depths of the water below, a familiar oval shape - smooth, glittering, beautiful - surmounted by the gleaming cyclops eye appears. The saucer rises from the water like a great porpoise, hovers just above the ice, then begins rising slowly into the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY - REACTION SHOT - WENDOVER AND REEF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Reef exclaims excitedly:
</DIRECTION>
<REEF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Skipper - I think - it is! It's Cyclops!
	</DIALOGUE>
</REEF>
<DIRECTION>
Wendover pushes him aside for a quick look himself. Then, he leaps for the intercom, barks:
</DIRECTION>
<WENDOVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the Skipper! Fire! Fire!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WENDOVER>
<DIRECTION>
SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE TIGER SHARK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now we see a discharge like compressed air below the ICBM. It floats up and away from the Shark, in a ver- tical position. Then, straight as an arrow, it heads for the surface.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE HOLE IN THE ICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now, from the black water, the ICBM leaps into-the air, like a suddenly released, air-filled ball. As it leaps above the surface, the mighty rocket engines ignite with a ROARING BLAST, and the ICBM leaps high into the air, roars up o.s.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - WITH ICBM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It rises higher and higher, faster and faster, into the sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE SAUCER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It, too, is moving faster and faster, on what should appear to be a converging course with the missile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE SKY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is the 'money' shot - to make or break the picture. In one corner of the frame, the saucer rises swiftly. But as it moves to center frame, in from the opposite corner comes the ICBM, heading straight and true for the saucer. They meet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The explosion is tremendous - a mighty, nuclear fireball, great chunks of debris hurled sizzling into space in all directions, a booming, pounding after-shock wave, then a great sweeping mushroom cloud. After this.....nothing but empty sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUTS TO COVER - THE PHENOMENA ABOVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY - REACTION SHOT - PANNING LL THE PRINCIPALS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shock, the exultation, the relief, then the sagging easement of tension...it is beyond words. Wendover looks at Kent, with a look more eloquent than an hour speech. Sir Ian's eyes are misty with gratitude. Carl begins trembling with reaction, and Reef puts a comforting arm around him. Griff sags onto a stool, head down, just moving his head aimlessly from side to side. Reef and Wendover exchange a look of silent understanding.
