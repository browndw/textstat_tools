EXT. NEON SIGN - THE PRINCE MOTEL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The N and the E are not working. So it reads the PR IC motel. ROOMS TO RENT BY DAY, WEEK, MONTH. KITCHENETTES. The Prince Motel has passed its prime. A few beat up cars are parked outside rooms. We CRANE DOWN to ROOM SEVEN. Curtains closed, but someone is holding it open a crack, looking out. We PUSH in CLOSE TO THE WINDOW and the EYE looking over the parking lot. Then the curtain closes.

INT. ROOM SEVEN - PRINCE MOTEL - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Peeling flowered wallpaper, ultra-cheap furniture. The man moving away from the window is RODRIGUEZ. He is slender, sports a thin mustache, hair slicked straight back. He's in his late thirties. Slightly nervous.

Another man sits on the couch, looking at a magazine. He is forty, solidly built. His name is FRANK DIVINCI.

	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RODRIGUEZ>
<DIVINCI>

	Look, I'm not in Hawaii, I'm here. But I don't want to be here, I want to be in Hawaii. I can't be in Hawaii, therefore I think about it so as to not get depressed about being here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIVINCI>
<RODRIGUEZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I'm here, I know I'm here, I don't like being here, but I can't be anyplace else because I look around and I see all this shit. How do you get around that?! That's what I'm asking.

EXT. DARK STREET - NIGHT

Poor side of town. A few old cars parked on the street. Some buildings vacant. A LATE MODEL WHITE CADILLAC cruises past. We HEAR LOUD RAP MUSIC.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LIONEL HUDD drives. Hudd is thirty. African American. The MUSIC is loud. His clothes lean to African roots. A WOMAN sits next to the passenger window. Her name is CYNTHIA WEBB. Cynthia is thirty-five, dressed in short provocative skirt, tight top. A little too much make-up. She's lead a hard life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She glances at Hudd. Hudd glances at her, looks down at her skirt hiked up on her leg.
</DIRECTION>
<CYNTHIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Left at the corner.

Hudd's eyes linger on her thighs for a moment, then he turns his attention back to driving, tapping along with the heavy bass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PRINCE MOTEL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Cadillac pulls into the parking lot. Parks in front of room SEVEN. Hudd gets out, looks around. Cynthia gets out, leads him to SEVEN. Knocks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The curtains pull back. Divinci looks at Hudd and Cynthia. She nods to him. The door unlocks and opens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cynthia enters. Hudd looks around again. Then follows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOTEL ROOM SEVEN - NIGHT

Divinci waits at the door. He and Hudd eye each other as Hudd enters the room. Divinci looks out, making sure no one has followed, then shuts the door.

	Hope you don't mind me checkin' you for weapons.

Divinci hesitates. This could break the deal.
</DIRECTION>
<HUDD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just don't want no man handlin' me.

</HUDD>
<DIRECTION>
Hudd looks at Cynthia. The suggestion is taken.
</DIRECTION>
<DIVINCI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Check him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIVINCI>
<DIRECTION>
Hudd spreads his legs, lifts his arms. Cynthia would rather not have the job, but there's no choice.
</DIRECTION>
<HUDD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lotta good hidin' places on this body. Check good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HUDD>
<DIRECTION>
Cynthia runs her hands over Hudd, checking pockets, pants, sleeves. Finally coming to his crotch. Hudd smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<HUDD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Careful. It's loaded.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HUDD>
<DIRECTION>
Cynthia has heard it all before. She's not squeamish in the least and she gives him a good going over.
</DIRECTION>
<CYNTHIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's got nothin'.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYNTHIA>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles back at Hudd. Then moves away, sits on the couch and seductively crosses her legs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Divinci, satisfied, pulls a PLASTIC BAG packed tight with COCAINE out of his pocket, tosses it to Hudd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hudd sits on the couch, opens the bag, sticks his finger in and tastes the contents. But never takes his eyes off Divinci.
</DIRECTION>
<HUDD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not bad, not bad. Any more where this came from?

</HUDD>
<DIVINCI>

Hudd stands, unzips his pants. Reaches in to grab his cock, but instead, pulls out a stack of MONEY. Inch thick.
</DIRECTION>
<HUDD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Told you there was a lotta good hidin' places on this body.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HUDD>
<DIRECTION>
Hudd hands the money to Divinci and pockets the plastic bag. Then crosses to the door. Glances back at Cynthia.

Deserted. No one on the street this late. Several of the buildings are boarded up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hudd drives. No music this time. His attitude has changed. More serious. LIGHTS in the REAR VIEW MIRROR. Coming up fast. Hudd watches as the car pulls around to pass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He glances at the CAR as it pulls past him, but all we SEE is the FLASH OF A BLAST FROM A GUN. Front WINDOW EXPLODING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CADILLAC
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
swerves into a parked car. The OTHER CAR -- a BUICK REGAL -- screeches to a stop next to it. ONE MAN gets out. Moving quickly to the Cadillac. It's dark, difficult to see. He carries a SMITH AND WESSON .44. Opens the door. He's wearing PLASTIC GLOVES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hudd is dead, slumped against the passenger door. The man reaches in, turns off the engine, grabs the plastic bag of cocaine. And now we see it's Divinci.

Rodriguez is the driver. Anxious. Engine running.

<DIRECTION>
Not a great part of the city. Apartment buildings line both sides of the street. An alley runs between two of the buildings. A TAXI pulls up in front. HEADLIGHTS SHINING on a MAN passed out in the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cynthia exits the taxi. The taxi pulls away. She glances at the man passed out in the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His clothes are ragged. He's filthy. His face covered in beard and greasy dirty hair. Hard to tell how old he is. Maybe forty. Maybe eighty. Who knows? His hand clutches a bottle in a bag.
</DIRECTION>
<CYNTHIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Joe, wake up. Get outa the street before you get run over. Joe, wake up!

She nudges him with her foot. The man groans, rolls back. Dead drunk.

<CYNTHIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're in the street, Joe. Get outa the street.

The man, JOE, is silent for a moment, then he starts to crawl -- toward the middle of the street.

<CYNTHIA>

	Other way, Joe.

Joe turns his crawl toward the curb. Cynthia watches him for a moment. He is truly pathetic.

A door is pushed open. Rodriguez enters his one bedroom apartment. Starts to shut the door when TWO MEN appear from the shadows. The first is short, well dressed. His name is VIC. The second is large, heavy-set, shaved head. His name is CUTLESS SUPREME. Cutless Supreme is not a man to be messed with.

</RODRIGUEZ>
<VIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I apologize. I understand your concerns. But you must understand that, unlike a bank, I cannot rely on a late fee as sufficient encouragement to repay one's debts. I am forced to employ the likes of Mr. Cutless Supreme, whom I might add, contributes significantly to my overhead. I am the real loser here. And I am concerned about your sincerity in repaying the twenty- seven thousand, nine hundred forty- two dollar gambling debt that is one week past due. What can you do to reassure me of your good intentions?

	I can make your life fuckin' miserable that's what I can do.

</RODRIGUEZ>
<VIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at me. Do I have a wife and three kids? Do I have a good job at IBM? Am I a handsome guy? No, no and no. I loan money at excessively high interest rates to pricks like you who can't control their urges to lose big money playing cards and then I am forced to stay up all night trying to convince them that I have needs, too. The point of which is, I already have a fuckin' miserable life. So don't threaten me you lousy bag of cat shit.

Rodriguez steps toward Vic, but Cutless Supreme slides in between them. Rodriguez isn't going to win this one.

	All I'm askin' is that you be responsible. Is that unreasonable?

UNIFORMED GUARDS are on hand to make sure there is no discussion, verbal or otherwise, between accused and witness. SIX MEN file onto the platform. All shady characters.

Cynthia counts three from the left and... wait a minute. She looks more closely. Just to be sure. Rodriguez and Divinci watch her. She's obviously putting on a good show. Then she turns to Divinci, sitting next to her and whispers --

Divinci is caught a little of guard -- he didn't expect a private conversation, nor does he want one for fear of it looking like he's coaching her.

Cynthia starts to protest again, but she suddenly feels Divinci's hand grip her arm. He's had enough. Cynthia gets the message. And while keeping her eyes locked on Divinci she says --

The Prosecutor is a woman. Her name is HELEN EDEN. She is thirty-nine. She wears a business suit. RICHARD STEIN is her second in command. Richard is thirty-three.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The DEFENSE ATTORNEY is fifty and a little on the portly side. His name is JOHN OBLINGER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But it's the DEFENDANT that really attracts our attention. His name is CLYDE D. DUNNER. He's done his best to look like a law abiding citizen, but no matter what kind of clothes he wears or how he slicks down his long hair or trims his mustache, this sonuvabitch looks like he'd kill for a nickel. He's on trial for murder. In the first. What a surprise.

We are in the midst of opening statements. And Helen is keeping the JURY riveted. The presiding Judge is a WOMAN, JUDGE WEINBERG.

	-- when the defendant, Clyde Dunner, entered the house of George and Carol Beaman on Friday night, a .44 caliber pistol in his hand. He entered the house with one thing in mind. To kill George and Carol, the people he blamed for the break up of his marriage to Carol's sister, Paula.

<DIRECTION>
The defendant is hardly listening. His attention is on TWO MEN SITTING BEHIND the prosecution table. And he turns to glare at them. The two men are DETECTIVES RODRIGUEZ and DIVINCI.

Clyde glares at them as if he'd like to get up right now, walk over to them and cut off their heads. Actually, that's what he's thinking. He mouths "You die."

Divinci mouths back. "Fuck you, prick, asshole, dickhead." Then he smiles. Clyde boils.

	George and Carol were watching a movie when he entered the living room and opened fire. George was killed instantly, hit in the face. Carol died later of three bullet wounds to her chest.

The courtroom doors open and Cynthia is lead down the aisle by a SHERIFF'S DEPUTY. She moves to the chair.

But it's Joe's turn to double take. He remembers her. My God, he knows her. It's Cynthia -- the girl from the apartment building. He never saw who pointed him out, but he never expected it to be her.

	I'm not trying to confuse the witness, it's the witness that's trying to confuse the court. I have witnesses who will refute her testimony. Witnesses who were on that corner the night of the shooting, who never saw Ms. Webb, who never heard the gunshot, who never saw Joe run past. Ms Webb saw Joe outside her apartment building that night because he lived in the alley next to it. Isn't that right, Ms Webb?

Arthur watches Cynthia's reaction to "when she's dead." But Cynthia has seen enough not to be too shocked by anything. And her reaction is subtle. She knows better than to reveal what she's really feeling and thinking.
