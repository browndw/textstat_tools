in the blackness, a man, FRED, is sitting on a bed smoking a cigarette. we see his back, but with each glow of the cigarette ash, we see his face reflected in a mirror on the wall across from him. In the darkness, there starts the sound of a motor which draws curtains back across a large picture window just off screen. As the curtain moves, hard-edged light begins crawling across the room, and we see everything clearly. Fred is wearing a robe and pajamas, it's early morning.

Fred is in bed waiting for Renee. He hears noises from the bathroom - bottles clinking, drawers opening and closing. Renee comes out wearing a robe, which she sheds just before getting into bed. Naked under the covers, she switches out her bedside lamp. The only light in the room comes from the outside, through the windows. Fred moves closer to Renee, puts his lips to her cheek, a hand on her breast. She does not respond. Fred pulls Renee to him, and kisses her passionately. Renee accedes to his demands, but does not participate willingly. He makes love to her voraciously, but her lack of passion disturbs him. Fred can't stop, however, and when he comes she acts consolingly, stroking him maternally while he calms down. He climbs off of her and retreats to his side of the bed.

INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - STAIRWELL / LIVING ROOM - DAY

Fred is standing in the living room looking in the direction of the stairwell. We HEAR someone's steps coming up the stairs. It's Renee, who eventually comes into view. She is holding another manila envelope. She arrives at the top step.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She and Fred lock eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fred takes the envelope, opens it, and pulls out a third videotape. without saying anything, Fred takes the tape to the VCR. He inserts it very carefully, slowly. He hits play, turns on the television and he and Renee sit down on the couch together and begin to watch with great apprehension.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Again we begin with a WIDE SHOT and then the TV monitor fills the screen: We see the interior of the house at night. The camera glides looking down from a high angle along the hallway and into the bedroom, where Fred and Renee are sleeping.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Again, the DRONING SOUND plays throughout.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
in the bedroom where Fred and Renee are seen sleeping, SUDDENLY, Fred, on the tape, slowly awakens as the camera holds on him. He rises and turns unnaturally in the bed, as if drawn up by his awareness of some strange presence in the room. He comes to a sitting position, his head straining upwards, looking in the direction of the camera. At this point, the videotape image turns to snow.

INT. ANDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A swinging party is in progress at Andy's house - the man whose face we saw at the Luna Lounge with Renee. ANDY, 37 years old, a slick guy, is seen moving through the crowd, making small talk, kissing and being kissed. The PEOPLE here are wannabe players, the men mostly shady, gold-chain- wearing, slightly unsavory types; the women dressed provocatively, big hair and skin-tight dresses. Through sliding glass doors we see nude and semi-nude people cavorting in a swimming pool. Everyone has a drink in his or her hand. Renee finishes her drinkt and hands the empty glass to Fred who walks away with it. Andy grabs Renee, and dances with her. They laugh and talk. Renee appears to be a bit intoxicated.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fred, who appears less than thrilled with the carryings on, makes his way to the open bar where he orders two drinks. When the drinks arrive he drains one of them completely, then sets the empty glass down on the bar. Then he swallows the other drink, too, and sets down the glass.
</DIRECTION>

A MYSTERY MAN, tall, well-dressed and groomed, older than Fred, approaches him.

Fred, mirthful at first, as if it is a party trick of some kind, suddenly turns serious - it's obvious he's thinking now of the videotapes. He speaks into the phone.

BLOOD is splattered over the floor, bed, walls. The camera drifts. THE DEAD BODY OF RENEE lies on the floor at the foot of the bed. She is badly mutilated. Fred is hovering over her on the tape, ON HIS KNEES, A HORRIFIED, UNBELIEVING EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE. On the tape, Fred turns away from Renee - his hands raised, dripping blood - her blood. His movements are almost mechanical, constricted, as he strains strangely upwards seemingly against his will, as if feeling some enormous pressure. He looks directly at the camera, his face a ghastly grimace, contorted, just before the taped image goes to snow.

Pete's parents, BILL and CLAIRE DAYTON, escorted by a PRISON GUARD, are approaching the Warden's office. It is a long walk along the corridor and the camera examines them in detail as they get closer and closer to the office. The Daytons are a middle-aged, San Fernando Valley couple. Bill Dayton is wearing a sport shirt with the short-sleeves rolled up. His skin is leathery, tanned and his thinning hair is slicked back in a duck-tail. He's working-class, ex-biker. Claire Dayton was obviously a good looking "chick" who's gone to seed from too much sun, cigarettes and booze. She retains the remnants of a good figure, but it's going fast.

Pete is on a skate - working under a car. The radio is on and a tune comes on that begins to drive Pete crazy - it gives him a headache. The tune is one of Fred Madison's be- bop saxophone pieces. Pete gets out from under the car and goes to the radio. He changes the station. PHIL, another mechanic working nearby, looks at Pete.

Pete rubs his throbbing head and when he gets back under the car, he lays on the skate - unable to work.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A car horn honks and the sound reverberates inside the garage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pete looks up - from under the car he sees the wheels of a Cadillac roll up just outside the open garage doors. He sees a car door open and Mr. Eddy's feet appear and walk in his direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pete winces and wheels himself out from under the car. He stands as Mr. Eddy walks up to him, then freezes as he sees - back behind Mr. Eddy, sitting in the passenger seat of the car - a beautiful blonde-haired GIRL, who looks exactly like Renee.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP BEAUTIFUL GIRL - she looks exactly like Renee except she is about eight years younger. The girl is staring right into Pete's eyes.

Mr. Eddy steps between Pete and the girl - blocking her from Pete. Mr. Eddy smiles at Pete - not noticing or not letting on that he notices the serious eye contact going on between Pete and the girl.

Pete is sitting perched unsteadily on the very edge of his bed. He HEARS a succession of highly-amplified SOUNDS at intervals with eerie stretches of silence: CRICKETS in fractured cadence a distant TELEVISION - a FLY buzzing slowly in the room a MOTH'S wings beating against light bulbs in the ceiling fixture - the washing of DISHES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pete's reaction to these sounds is one of petrified confusion. Underlying these sounds is a kind of unearthly, steady DRONE.

Pete gets up off the bed, unsteadily. He moves toward his bedroom door. As he moves the amplified SOUNDS shift.

Pete opens his door and peers out.

ALICE'S STORY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see Alice wearing a sexy tight dress in a plain room. It feels like we are inside of a large building - maybe an office building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alice is waiting nervously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SLICKSTER in shiny shirt and pants is leaning against a closed door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is another door off the room which is open onto a room where a MUSCLE MAN in tiny briefs is doing bench presses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No one is saying anything.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
(voiceover)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I went to this place... They made me wait forever. There was some guy guardin' the door... I started gettin' nervous... In another room I could see some guy liftin' weights... Both these guys gave me the creeps... They never said anything to me... So I just smoked cigarettes and waited.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
We move in on a nervous EXHALE OF SMOKE to a CLOSE UP of Alice waiting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see a CLOSE UP of the man guarding the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see a CLOSE SHOT of the man bench pressing a lot of weight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, there are two knocks on the other side of the closed door. The Slickster moves off the door and opens it a crack. He talks quietly to someone Alice can't see, then he turns, opens the door and gestures for Alice to go through.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alice puts out her cigarette - her hand is shaking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She walks over past the Slickster and enters a much larger room. There are about FIFTEEN MEN in the room - all leaning comfortably at different points on the walls. There is only one chair in the room - Mr. Eddy is sitting in it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No one says anything to her, but one man nods his head and from this nod, Alice feels she should walk to the center of the room. She does, and she instinctively turns to the man sitting in the chair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They all just stare at her silently. She looks around nervously - her eyes return to Mr. Eddy's.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, a man steps quickly up to her - draws a pistol and cocks it against her head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alice goes weak in the knees. Her eyes fill with fear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The men continue to stare.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Eddy gives Alice a small gesture as if to say "well?".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Somehow she knows what they want, even though they haven't asked for it with words.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alice starts to undress - slowly - in as sexy a way as she knows how.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The men just stare without expression.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When she is completely naked, Mr. Eddy gestures her over to him. Soon she is on her knees in front of him - making herself available for whatever he wants.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Eddy's POV - Alice looks in his eyes. She reaches her hand up to stroke his cheek...

	Great question!! In the east ... the far east... when a person is sentenced to death... they're sent to a place where they can't escape... never knowing when an executioner will step up behind them and fire a bullet into the back of their head... it could be days... weeks... or even years after the death sentence has been pronounced... This uncertainty adds an exquisite element of torture to the situation, don't you think? It's been a pleasure talking to you.

The phone goes dead and Pete sits - fearfully pondering his fate. He hears a NOISE and turns.

Down at the far end of the hall he sees his parents staring at him.

CLOSE UP ON PARENTS staring in the direction of the living room as if sensing something, but not seeing.

EXT. DEEP DELL PLACE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see a street sign saying "Deep Dell Place". Pete walks up the street looking at numbers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He finds 2224 Deep Dell Place - Andy's House.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stares at the house from the sidewalk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lights are on upstairs and down. The hot wind moves big shadows of trees over the front of the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pete looks at his watch. It reads: 11:05 p.m.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks down the driveway, crosses through some bushes and comes to a fence separating the front yard from the back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stops and listens. He pulls himself up and over the fence, but crashes on something on the other side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He freezes - listening. He hears the wind blowing through the trees, and distant music from inside - a slow jazz piece. He hears echoing sounds of love making.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He makes his way around back - goes up the stairs and tries the back door. It opens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO: INT. ANDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pete sneaks through the kitchen and comes into the living room. Pete stops short and stares. A movie projector is running in the living room. A porno film is being projected on a huge screen at the far end. Alice is in the porno film. A man is fucking her from behind - with LOUD SLAPPING SOUNDS of flesh banging flesh. Her face is in the foreground. Her eyes look out directly at Pete. She is loving every minute of it. Inside Pete, jealousy starts to rage out of control. He looks around. He sees clothes scattered about. He picks up a girl's sweater and smells it. He looks up the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Feet appear at the top of the stairs. They start down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pete runs for the bar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Along the way, he grabs a heavy, bronze figurine of a well- stacked woman off a rectangular glass-topped coffee table, and ducks behind the bar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He can hear Andy approaching. He can hear Andy gather two glasses. He can hear Alice being fucked harder in the porno film. He clenches his teeth with rage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, Andy moves right in front of him. They see each other. Andy's eyes widen - Pete leaps up, and thwacks the bronze figurine down on the top of Andy's head. Andy falls. The breasts of the figurine have made two bloody holes in his forehead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pete turns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alice is coming quickly down the stairway - naked, except for a pair of panties. Lipstick is smeared around her mouth. She is carrying a half-filled pillowcase. Her porno film is playing on the wall behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
These images jump and spin in Pete's mind. He moves unsteadily toward her.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got him.

<DIRECTION>
Pete starts to tremble. He drops the figurine. He tries to embrace her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a crashing noise behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pete turns and sees Andy staggering, blood streaming from the wound in his head, THEN CHARGING FULL SPEED AT PETE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy hits him hard, and Pete goes down. When Pete hits the ground, he pushes Andy up and throws out his arms. This, and Andy's momentum, catapult Andy into the corner of the rectangular glass-topped coffee table. There is a sound like a hammer going through a bucket of eggs as the glass corner embeds about eight inches into Andy's forehead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP OF ANDY'S HEAD - impaled on the sharp corner of the table, his chest area suspended, his legs and stomach touching the floor.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow!
	</DIALOGUE>

Pete pulls himself off the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pete moves close to Alice, they drift to the glass coffee table, staring for a few moments at Andy's dead body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
While Pete stares, unbelieving, at Andy - Alice hurriedly picks up her sweater and puts it on. On the sofa next to it lay Andy's trousers. She goes through the pockets, finds a roll of cash bound by a rubber band. Alice hands the roll to Pete.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alice finds the rest of her clothes scattered about the living room and puts them on. Pete watches her, trembling, unable to say anything.

She comes back to Pete, who starts breathing irregularly, hyperventilating.

Alice starts off across the living room with the pillowcase.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pete opens his eyes, he sees Alice move as a blur. He looks around the room, which spins in and out of focus. His eyes land on, a PHOTOGRAPH in a frame on the wall. This photo troubles him. Pete squints, then points to the photograph.
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>

	Is that you? Are both of them you?

CLOSE UP OF THE PHOTOGRAPH - Four people appear in the frame: Andy, Renee, Alice and Mr. Eddy.

INT. ANDY'S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Pete staggers toward the bathroom at the rear right of the hallway. THE HALLWAY SUDDENLY BECOMES HAZY, DIFFERENT AND LONGER THAN IT APPEARED TO BE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pete wanders down this "changed" hall. On his left, he identifies a door with the number 25 on it. He pauses for a moment in front of it, then goes on until, on his right, he comes to a door with the number 26 on it. He enters through this door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside is a WOMAN in front of a mirror with a MAN. Her arms are resting on a shelf under the mirror as the man takes her from behind. The man's face is blank, featureless, and is buried in the woman's back - we can't see it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pete now sees that the woman is an extremely whorish version of Alice - she's looking at Pete's reflection in the mirror. He's looking at her reflection in the mirror. Pete's head is pounding.

He closes the door. The hallway has "changed" back to Andy's hallway. The doors no longer have numbers.

Alice turns when she hears Pete and they study each other's face as Pete makes his way to her. His head is still throbbing with pain. His focus goes from her face to the gun - which is pointing right at him - back to her. Alice smiles.

Alice jumps in Andy's car and tosses the bulging pillowcase in the back. Pete takes the revolver out of his belt. He opens the driver's side door of Andy's car and slowly sits inside.

A HOUSEBOY opens the door. Alice says something to him - Pete cannot bear anything that is said, even though his driver's side window is down. All he can hear is the hot wind blowing.

Pete and Alice drive up to a ONE ROOM CABIN built on stilts next to a dry lakebed. They both get out and go up the stairs to a porch where Alice knocks on the door. There is no answer.

Alice opens the door, but there is NOBODY INSIDE.

The hot wind continues to blow.

Alice and Pete walk back down to the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The HEADLIGHTS are on and Alice reaches in through the window and switches on the RADIO. She can't get anything in but static, with bits and pieces of old tunes fading in and out. She hits the "seek" button. The radio starts to search.
</DIRECTION>

Pete is standing in the glare of the headlights watching her. Alice walks slowly to him.

The camera captures this from a back seat perspective - then drifts toward them.

She kisses Pete over and over. He begins to kiss her back. She starts to move him in a dance to the music in the glare of the headlights, the hot wind caressing them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The scene is out of a dream. Alice and Pete help each other undress as they dance in and out of the light, and the wind whips at their bodies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They sink down on the soft ground and start making love.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lights from the headlights combine with the starlight, bathing them in a pristine glow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The music fades and the radio begins to "seek" through static for another station. The music it finds now is LOUD and INTENSE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alice - her hunger appearing, now becomes carnivorous in her approach to love making with Pete. She is the aggressor, highly-charged - she wants more and more - taking, not giving, insatiable.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The headlights flare their bodies in blinding light. They become amorphous, glowing shapes burning in the light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pete is trying desperately to please her - to have her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The driving music fills with cracks of piercing static. The radio strains to hold the station.

Pete's white-hot body clings to Alice. He chokes with emotion.

Pete turns, face down on the ground in the darkness. He's holding his head and shaking.

As he starts to stand - he turns into the glare of the headlights and we see that it is NOT PETE - BUT FRED.

As Fred stands up, the car's LIGHTS DIM and the RADIO FADES.

Fred looks at the car. He sees some movement inside. Fred looks closer and sees the figure of a man in the back seat.

The Mystery Man appears in the doorway of the cabin. He starts toward Fred.

Fred is driving along the two-lane desert "lost highway". The wind is picking up even stronger than before. A big storm is blowing in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fred sees a sign glowing just ahead that reads: LOST HIGHWAY HOTEL. The sign is swaying and blinking as the gusts hit it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fred pulls in and stops under the sign and stares at it.

He gets out of the car, tucks the pistol in his belt under his shirt and enters the hotel, which is an old two-story building.

Fred smokes the cigarette, listening to the wind blow. Lightning cracks outside the window.

Renee is sitting half dressed on the edge of the bed, pulling on her stockings. Mr. Eddy/Laurent is asleep next to her. Renee stands up, finishes dressing, then leans down and kisses her lover while he sleeps. Renee leaves the room, closing the door as quietly as possible behind her.
</DIRECTION>

As the door CLICKS, Mr. Eddy/Laurent wakes up. He sits up and gets a pack of cigarettes from the bedside table, shakes one out, lights it with a book of "Lost Highway Hotel" matches, and smokes it while seated on the edge of the bed.

Fred, still fully dressed, is waking up, AS IF IN A TRANCE - the same attitude he had on the videotape. He strains upwards and looks eerily around the room. He gets up and crosses slowly to a window. He takes the edge of the window curtain and pulls it back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The view is of the gravel parking lot of the hotel.

Fred's POV: He sees Renee, down below, walk over to a car, get in and drive away.

Fred puts the pistol up against Mr. Eddy/Laurent's head and marches him out of the room - past the camera's eye.

The camera stays in the room and moves slowly toward the window, through which we see Fred and Mr. Eddy/Laurent appear down below in the back lot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Still watching out the window, the camera sees Fred knock Mr. Eddy/Laurent over the head with the gun butt and put him into the trunk of a car. Fred slams the trunk lid and climbs into the driver's side of what is obviously Mr. Eddy/Laurent's car - the Mercedes 600 Pullman.
</DIRECTION>

As Fred drives away, a HAND appears in our window foreground. The hand moves the window curtain further to one side. The camera pulls back to reveal it as the hand of the Mystery Man. The Mystery Man leans fully into the frame and watches Fred drive off down the Lost Highway as day breaks.

Fred is driving along the road. Suddenly he pulls the car off the road and drives over the dirt and brush to a deserted spot, stops and gets out.

Fred opens the trunk. When he does ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, Mr. Eddy/Laurent charges up and attacks Fred - knocking them both to the ground. Mr. Eddy/Laurent tries to strangle Fred, but Fred's anger is too great. Fred tears loose and gets Mr. Eddy/Laurent in a hold bending his head back. Fred's hand reaches out behind him - feeling, searching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A KNIFE appears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
it comes into Fred's hand from another.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fred slices Mr. Eddy/Laurent's throat, and throws him down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Eddy/Laurent squirms on the ground - his hand grasped around his throat - trying to hold his neck together. Blood is flowing rapidly through his fingers and over the front of him as be turns and opens his mouth with a gurgling sound.

Fred stands, facing him, his pistol out now - pointing right at Mr. Eddy/Laurent's forehead.

The camera pans around to Fred - we see that the Mystery Man is standing beside Fred, and it is the Mystery Man who is holding the gun, not Fred.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Mystery Man reaches into his pocket and pulls out a little watchman TV. He turns it on and hands it over to Mr. Eddy/Laurent, who manages to take it.
</DIRECTION>

Mr. Eddy/Laurent looks down at the small television screen.

We see the movie screen on a wall in Andy's living room. Marian, Raquel and RENEE'S images are being projected on this screen, simultaneously involved in pornographic acts with two men. Watching this movie in Andy's living room are several people in shadows behind the light of the projector. Among them we see RENEE and MR. EDDY/LAURENT standing next to ANDY. Mr. Eddy/Laurent and Renee are hot - kissing - his hand is up under her skirt. They are watching the porno film. They are watching murky images of sex turning to violence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a CLOSE UP we see Renee and Mr. Eddy/Laurent in the shadows looking out at the film, both half-smiling, stoned, aroused.

The Mystery Man then leans close to Fred and whispers in his ear.

The camera moves in, past the Mystery Man to a CLOSE UP OF FRED'S EYES as he listens.
