LORD DESMOND CROFT is a stately business magnate but hardly a tomb raider. Unlike his wife, Lord Croft is far more interested in the OLD TRUNK across the room, overflowing with sports trophies, plus various academic plaques and certificates. He examines a "1st Place" GYMNASTICS TROPHY.

Lara limps along the monastery wall as the ceremony continues. She stops, her back to us, and stares down the sheer cliff into the fog- enshrouded valley below. CIRCLING AROUND Lara we reveal her face, her eyes -- nearly catatonic with grief. Melancholy classical MUSIC swells over the fading drums. As we PULL BACK, Lara inexplicably swan dives forward...

Lara gracefully climbs from the pool, showing off a beautifully sculpted physique...frustratingly wrapped in a towel. This is no longer the lonely, precocious girl we met 13 years ago; Lara has grown into a cool, physical young woman hiding a scarred heart that has never fully mended.

TIME CUT TO:

<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. CROFT ESTATE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lara cruises through the open estate gates on her motorcycle. But halfway up the cobblestone driveway, Lara slows her motorcycle -- all the lights are out in the grand manor!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Killing the cycle engine, Lara cautiously dismounts.
</DIRECTION>
<LARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Karak!?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARA>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of the GATES CLOSING behind her spins Lara around. Sensing she's about to be trapped, Lara runs for the gates, reaching them just as they close. Suddenly feeling vulnerable, Lara rushes back for her cycle to arm herself...only to find her saddlebag of gadgets has disappeared!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A GUNSHOT bursts the front tire of her motorcycle! Lara ducks for cover behind the bike, but a bright FLASHLIGHT exposes her. Instinctively, Lara sprints in the opposite direction, away from the light...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A blistering volley of GUNSHOTS kick up grass and dirt all around Lara, funneling her towards the elaborate HEDGEROWS which border the north side of the estate. Suddenly --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- A LARGE STATUE tips over near the hedgerow entrance! Lara dives sideways, SOMERSAULTING to safety...or so she thinks --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- ANOTHER STATUE is nearly upon her from the other side, forcing Lara to BACKFLIP out of the way. She steals a breath, only to see the Statue's face EXPLODE from gunfire! Off she goes like a bullet herself...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE HEDGEROWS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lara creeps along the gravel pathway, lit only by small FOOTLAMPS. All around her in the labyrinth she can hear FOOTSTEPS of unknown assassins somewhere amidst the 10' hedge walls. Lara creeps quietly, her eyes unblinking while maintaining a nearly imperceptible breathing rhythm --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- SHTOOOOSH! A long wooden SPEAR juts through the hedgerow nearly impaling her. Lara jumps back...only to have a second spear block her path! Turning to run, Lara reacts in mid-stride to yet another spear in front of her: she dives to the ground...ROLLING HER BODY lengthwise beneath six more jutting SPEARS...until she hits the end of the pathway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When the next spear jabs from the hedgerow, Lara is ready: she grasps it quickly with both hands -- surprising her unseen attacker -- and yanks the spear from him!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seeing an ASSASSIN approaching her with flashlight, Lara gets a running start down the connecting pathway...and uses the spear to VAULT HERSELF atop the hedgerow!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ATOP THE BORDER WALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leaping from the hedgerow up onto the 15' border wall, Lara -- armed with the wooden spear -- now stands atop the stone border wall surrounding the property's perimeter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An ASSASSIN (with a FLASHLIGHT) comes at her from one direction atop the border wall...forcing Lara to sprint the other direction. Until another ASSASSIN up ahead on the border wall blocks her path. Trapped again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As GUNSHOTS ring out Lara examines her options: It's a 15 foot jump down to the ground, where a ROSE GARDEN will make for a very painful landing. With the Assassins closing in fast from both directions what will Lara do?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>

Lara tries each of the rear doors. All locked. About to bust one of the windows in with a patio chair, Lara's distracted by a FLASHLIGHT shone in her eyes from inside the house. Then, an ominous WHOOOOSHING sound overhead...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV - LARA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LARGE SATELLITE DISH falling from the manor roof! Hurtling right at Lara...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lara dives out of the way, then watches incredulously as the satellite dish -- still attached to the roof by its THICK CABLE -- pendulums right at her. Just as Lara drops to her knees, FLASHLIGHTS from both sides of the backyard converge on her...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unless she can get back up onto the border wall, Lara is seemingly trapped once again. But as the satellite dish swings back at her, Lara gets an idea:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Timing her jump perfectly, Lara hops onto the swinging satellite dish. And as FOUR ASSASSINS close in below her, Lara uses the thick cable to expertly SCALE the side of the three story manor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE ROOFTOP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lara relaxes for a moment, catching her breath...then shocked to see still another ASSASSIN emerging from one of the attic windows. Avoiding the glare of his FLASHLIGHT, Lara runs to the edge of the roof. Decision time. She can either jump for the GUEST QUARTERS roof about 20' below her; or, she can take her chances with the assassin advancing behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Taking a deep breath, Lara measures her steps back from the roof edge. Then, gathering herself gymnast style (as she did so many years ago in the Himalayas), Lara runs full steam for the edge...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...but bails out at the last second! Sliding to a stop on the loose shingles...and slipping off the edge!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Lara dangles precariously from the rickety rain gutter:

Stepping down off the final stair, her eyes wide and alert, Lara enters Tupac's tomb with only a FLASHLIGHT. The rectangular room appears harmless: an ornately carved SARCOPHAGUS raised on a stone pedestal. One more step, though, and the stairs behind her suddenly retract into the wall with a resounding THUD!
</DIRECTION>

Carlos is kneeled at the edge of the stairs where there is now a 15' drop down into the tomb.

Lara hops up onto the stone pedestal to keep away from the rising oil, which curiously stops flowing once the room is covered with a one foot layer of the black ooze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Not sure what to make of this, Lara returns to the task at hand. Using all her strength, Lara pushes the heavy lid of the sarcophagus... inside of which she finds A BEJEWELED KEY resting on the Prince's mummified chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But when Lara takes the key...the sarcophagus starts to lower into the oil!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT SHOT: FLINT STONES on the back of the sarcophagus scrape the wall and SPARK as it lowers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE TOMB BURSTS INTO FLAMES! Lara instinctively leaps for the rope Carlos has lowered from the edge of the stairs...just catching it with her fingertips!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lara scrambles up the rope -- which is burning behind her -- as TWO STONE SLATS slide closed from both sides of the stairwell. The tomb is sealing itself up like a kiln...with Lara in it! Carlos grabs hold of the rope and pulls Lara to safety just the tomb seals itself. Again, Carlos is emotionally spent.

:SC: INT. QUEEN'S TOMB - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This time Lara descends the stairs more carefully while Carlos watches on from midway up. With every step, Lara scans the walls, the floor, the ceiling. When she reaches the bottom of the steps, she half- expects the stairs to retract again...but they don't.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Queen's SARCOPHAGUS is set in a RECTANGULAR DEPRESSION in the floor against the far wall. Lara is now faced with a long walk across the room, her every step echoing ominously. Sweat starts to bead on her forehead as Lara searches vainly for a sign of the traps to come...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, Lara reaches the depression and gently climbs down next to the sarcophagus. She drops to her knees and inspects every inch of the coffin: no signs of a trap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
So Lara cautiously tests the lid, which is carved in the shape of a beautiful woman --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- SPIKES SHOOT FROM THE HANDS, EYES, AND MOUTH ON THE LID! The lid itself then springs upright on its lateral hinge, right at Lara...who jumps backwards against the depression wall just enough so that the spikes stop millimeters from her torso and face!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, loud GRINDING can be heard behind the main tomb's side walls...which now start closing in above Lara! A quick check of the distance back to the stairs tells Lara she'll never make it before being squashed...or sealed into the rectangular depressicn with the Queen's mummy!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
So Lara MULE-KICKS the sarcophagus lid above the hinge...which cracks and sends the lid smashing back onto its resting place atop the sarcophagus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now Lara runs to the back of the sarcophagus and slides the lid forward...until it teeters on the front edge of the sarcophagus, then tilts to the floor. This leaves one end of the lid pointed at the ceiling (just above the lip of the depression) and the other end of the lid touching the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a flash -- with the tomb side walls getting closer each second -- Lara grabs the second KEY from the Queen's mummy, then hops over the tilted lid, climbs out of the rectangular depression and makes a run for it across the main tomb floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REACTION SHOT: Carlos has his hands over his eyes, watching through his fingers as:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The walls continue to close in tighter. But moments before Lara is crushed...the walls stop! Lara looks back, pleased to see: the raised end of the sarcophagus lid has stopped the walls from closing further. Her plan worked --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- CRUUUUUUNCH! The lid BUCKLES and CRACKS under the extreme pressure. The walls lurch to life again!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lara starts running...the path back to the stairs getting ever more narrow...forcing Lara to run side-step now...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CU - THE SARCOPHAGUS LID is about to be pulverized!

Lara senses the end and executes a mid-air TWIST/REVERSE ROUND OFF, sticking her landing three steps below Carlos just as the walls SLAM together. Carlos shakes his head.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- WHUUUMP! The double doors have slammed shut behind Lara.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the far side of the grotto Lara finds an ornate entranceway blocked by solid gold SUN RAYS. But the gaps between rays are not large enough to crawl through. So Lara pulls out her VIDEO PROBE with REMOTE CONTROL DEVICE (and mini view screen). Activating the airjet-powered probe, Lara sends it floating inside the dark burial chamber.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CU - REMOTE MINI-SCREEN: Inscribed on all the walls are PAINTINGS telling of Manco's great deeds. Depictions of wars won, incredible amounts of gold amassed. One painting shows Manco holding a BLACK, VASE-LIKE OBJECT from which gold seems to flow. Another painting finds Manco praying before the black, vase-like object set atop a glowing SHRINE.
</DIRECTION>

Lara navigates the probe over to the centerpiece of Manco's burial chamber: a round, solid gold SARCOPHAGUS. A spiral of HIEROGLYPHICS particularly interests Lara, who starts feeding the images into her laptop database. She mentally translates the message on the sarcophagus...

Seconds from death by impaling, Lara takes a deep breath and dives to the center of the reflecting pool...

Lara searches for and finds a NARROW INLET through which all the water is flowing into the grotto. Barely able to fit, Lara squeezes inside, FLASHLIGHT illuminating the way...

Lara is swimming right at us, sloping upwards now. Her eyes wide with fear as her lungs begin to shrink. Determination turns to desperation as she abandons the flashlight to stroke with both hands. Faster and faster...into darkness...

Gasping for air, Lara bursts up through the surface of the lake, recognizable by the missing WEDGE in one side.

First point of interest: the Napo river where Dodge dropped her off. The trawler is no longer moored near the rapids. Scanning further up river, Lara spots Dodge's vessel half-way back to Francisco de Orellana.
</DIRECTION>

Lara PANS the goggles to Malvern's base camp, which looks invitingly deserted. Until Lara flicks on the THERMAL-VIEW FILTER...illuminating FIVE BODY-HEAT AURAS, lurking in a near-perfect perimeter around the camp.

From her backpack, Lara removes a SPREAD PIN. Loading it into her compression assembly pistol, Lara takes aim on a tree directly across from her by 50 meters -- a tree with roots planted right near the Bell-Boeing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The spread pin shoots silently to the treetop and catches in a branch "V." Lara ties off the wire end to her cinchona tree. Using a HAND TROLLEY, Lara starts the long, precarious journey from tree to tree.

Lara drops five feet as the wire goes slack, then taut again! The spread pin re-catches in another "V." Now Lara's dangling by her hands only, clinging to the hand trolley.
</DIRECTION>

Directly below her, Larsen stands, alerted. Fingers on the uzi trigger, Larsen looks every direction but up.

Lara gracefully regains her shimmy position and continues on into the tree unseen.

Lara bites her lower lip in concentration as she tries to re-hook the keys. Out of the corner of her eyes she can see the Aussies emerging one-by-one from the jungle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One last try and the keys are hooked on the probe. But as Lara steers the probe back towards the cockpit, a warning light flashes on the remote control: "COMPRESSION LOW."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Outside, the probe falters, the compressed air-jets not moving it as fast now...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malvern spots the probe -- and the keys -- heading towards the Bell- Boeing. Malvern OPENS FIRE, prompting everyone to unload their clips.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The probe spins around drunkenly, its jet assembly damaged... Lara leans precariously out of the cockpit, briefly exposing herself to Aussie gunfire, and reaches for the probe. She grabs the keys just as the probe falls to the ground!

Dodge looks at Lara, who is taking a peaceful catnap in the passenger seat. Cutting the engine, Dodge stares at her for a moment, finally glimpsing the young girl beneath the tough exterior. Lara senses him staring and blinks awake.

As Lara ascends, Dodge is buffeted again by the winds, this time spinning him around several times.

Lara traverses a difficult outcropping by moving hand-over-hand until she finds purchase for her foot. Just as she reaches the edge of a large, overgrown plateau with RUINS...

<DIRECTION>
INSERT SHOT: Dodge's anchor pin pulls from the stone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dodge yells as he FREE FALLS down the mountain face!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lara sees what's coming and tries to brace herself -- PRIIIING! Dodge's guide line goes taut and starts to pull Lara down with him. Sliding back over the edge, Lara somehow manages to brace herself -- legs spread wide -- catching a rock with each foot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dodge jerks to a stop! His guide line belt SNAPPING A BUCKLE and busting open...leaving Dodge dangling by his hands! He now makes the mistake of looking down at the dizzying height.

Lara frantically re-secures Dodge's guide line around an upper rock. Once done, Lara flips her carabiner onto Dodge's guide wire and begins rappelling down the mountain face.

Covering 20 yards between each touch, Lara almost appears to be flying. Glancing down, she sees Dodge swinging wildly in the wind.

Timing her last rappel perfectly, Lara propels herself laterally as well...swinginq at Dodge just as his own swing reaches its climax. Like an acrobat, Lara scoops up Dodge in one arm -- he releases the belt and grabs onto her tightly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Together they swing, spinning in the wind like dancers on a cloud... across the mountain face until Lara catches a crag with her feet and brings their thrill ride to an end.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Their resulting embrace couldn't be any more intimate. Their faces no closer together. This shared near-death moment has left both of them breathless with a nearly post-coital bliss.

<DIRECTION>
-- SWUUUSH! SWUUUSH! TWO CIRCULAR BLADES scissor simultaneously from the walls nearly beheading Lara, who dives to the ground and rolls to safety just as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- CRUNCH! CRUNCH! CRUNCH! BOULDERS drop like deadly hailstones all around Lara, collapsing the floor tiles and revealing SPIKE BEDS beneath them. Lara sprints across the rapidly checkerboarding floor to the DOOR at the end of the room...but the door is only a painting! Lara reacts as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- THWIT-THWIT-THWIT-THWIT! DARTS shoot from the faux door, prompting Lara to instinctively SIDE-FLIP to safety...but only for a moment because --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- CRAAAACK! THE FLOOR TILES give way beneath her, just as Lara spots an ELEVATED PASSAGEWAY. She leaps for and barely catches the lip of the passage. While Lara hangs there:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dodge watches in awe as: THE ENTIRE ROOM RESTORES ITSELF in five incredible seconds! Floor tiles hinge back into place, blades disappear back into walls, etc. Not even any boulders.

With a tremendous show of strength, Lara now pulls herself up into a HANCSTAND on the lip, then gracefully executes a WALKOVER into the passageway. Breathing hard, but utterly composed, she turns back and gestures to Dodge.

She turns back, flashlight illuminating the entrance through which they entered; they are at about the midway point of the passageway. Removing a BULLET from her gun, Lara drops the ammo on the floor... where it starts rolling towards the pit. Rolling and rolling, indicating an incline which is not at all evident inside the passageway.
</DIRECTION>

THE PASSAGEWAY RUMBLES as a MASSIVE BOULDER drops down from the ceiling about 20 yards behind them. As Lara and Dodge sprint towards the pit --

Dodge takes one quick look back at the onrolling boulder (which fills about 3/4 of the passageway) before he leaps! Clinging onto the near blade's wooden stem just like Lara --

A TALL FLAME ignites from the top center of the pillar! (The other pillars ignite as well creating an eerie, deadly spectacle.) Instinctively, Lara BACKFLIPS...executing a HALF TWIST in midair as she lunges back for the ledge --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Dodge grabs Lara by the arm as she comes up short! Dangling over the edge by one hand -- feet skimming the water -- Lara notices two problems immediately: 1) Her shorts are ON FIRE!, and; 2) A BARRACUDA jumps from the water for one of her legs, which she daintily bends at the knee to avoid dismemberment.

ANOTHER TREMOR ROCKS THE CAVERN! Tearing the shrine in half and forming a LARGE FISSURE between Lara, Dodge and the escape column. Dodge grabs onto Lara's arm for emphasis:

Dodge watches as Lara moves away from the fissure's edge, measuring her steps back to him. Exhaling slowly, Lara gathers herself. Hands fall to her side; a gymnast before her routine. The cavern begins to SHAKE & RUMBLE with induced seismic activity. But Lara stays focused. And with quick, precision steps...she sprints for the edge and leaps...

The seaplane circles around high in the air, then sets down on the rolling waves a mile or so ahead of Malvern's ship. A beat, then Lara dives from the plane into the water.

Two people in HAZ-MAT suits walk down the corridor. They enter a room via a temporary AIR LOCK constructed around a HEAVILY REINFORCED STEEL DOOR.

Lara hurries to the door. On the wall is a conspicuously new emblem: the universal symbol for radiation. Lara peers into the room through the small door PORTHOLE, but the glass is FROSTED; Lara can see only silhouettes and movement...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Until the dark shape of a haz-mat helmet looms into view! Lara ducks behind the heavy door as it opens...and it swings right into her; Lara lets out an involuntary GRUNT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The HAZ-MAT AUSSIE spins around, alerted. Lara greets him with guns drawn. The Aussie waves frantically:

Lara emerges from a room wearing the Aussie's haz-mat suit. She heads for the REINFORCED DOOR, entering like she belongs. But Lara isn't prepared for the sight that greets her inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. MALVERN'S SHIP - B-LEVEL - SLAUGHTER ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room where the ship's catch was gutted, sliced and processed has been converted into a makeshift factory floor. Lara discreetly stashes her GUNS behind a shipping crate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On one side, two haz-mat-suited TECHS delicately load METAL CONTAINERS with radiation symbols on them into heavily insulated SHIPPING CRATES. Another tech logs the progress into COMPUTERS. Once the crates are secure, they are rolled by dolly into a nearby COLD-STORAGE LOCKER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Three more techs are queued up in front of a clear, two-foot thick plexi-glass WINDOW. Behind this air-lock divider is Malvern! But it's impossible for Lara to see exactly what he's up to. So she moves in for a closer view...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lara joins the line, careful to avoid the looks of the other technicians milling about the room. While she waits, Lara peeks over a tech's shoulder at his computer:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CU - COMPUTER SCREEN: Purchase orders, shipping manifests. Malvern is selling something to private buyers around the globe for millions more than the market price of a whale.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finding herself next in line, Lara sees for the first time: Malvern on the other side of the plexiglass, his arms encased in protective WALL- GLOVES, cupping with both hands the BLACK VEIL on Lara's side of the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tech in front of her places a piece of SCRAP IRON into the Black Veil, and as Malvern concentrates BLACK SMOKE billows from the obsidian cup. As the smoke dissipates, Malvern pours a GRAY LIQUID into the tech's CONTAINER.

<MALVERN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell're you doing?

Malvern finally recognizes Lara through her face plate. Lara answers by grabbing the Black Veil from Malvern's gloved hands. As Lara hurries for the reinforced door, Malvern yanks his arms from the gloves and hits and INTERCOM button.

Her breathing extremely labored now, Lara slides down the wall into a sitting position. Her eyes show the understandable panic coursing through her veins. But then her eyes focus on the Black Veil in her hands, still filled with plutonium. With the last reserves of strength she has, Lara closes her eyes and concentrates. BLACK SMOKE starts to billow from the Veil, sucked into the AIR VENTS overhead.

The Huey has been pullea within 30' of the deck, so the fall doesn't immediately kill Larsen, who smashes down into some SHIPPING CRATES.

Malvern and the other Aussies hurry down to the lower deck. With blood trickling from his mouth, Larsen holds up the metallic box. A victorious grin despite the pain.

Lara pitches the Huey so she can get a clear view of the harpoon gun, then uses the cable to crush the Aussie at the controls against the harpoon RELEASE LEVER -- Klank!

Finally free and clear, Lara pushes the Huey to its limit, speeding away from the ship as THE NIGHT SKY GOES RED!

The red flash fades to white, revealing A NUCLEAR MUSHROOM growing up from the water. The Huey Helicopter flies right at the camera, chased by the ENERGY WAVE. But Lara never looks back. And as the helicopter hits escape velocity, we;

This impressive West End flat is peopled with ELDERLY MEN in tuxes and AGING WOMEN draped in demure dresses and ostentatious jewelry. Aunt Ev flits about, hosting a cocktail party for the upper crust of British society.

Suddenly, the din of vapid conversation drops a notch. All eyes -- especially male -- fall firmly upon:

LARA crossing the room in black stiletto heels and a sheer, blood-red dress that hides everything...and yet nothing. Oddly, she's carrying a BRIEFCASE.
