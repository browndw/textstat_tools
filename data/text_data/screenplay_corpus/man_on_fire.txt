EXT. MEXICO CITY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
High over the city on a bright Sunday morning, the sun pounding its way through the orange haze of smog. As we descend toward the clots of traffic blocking the streets: the sounds of a Mass being sung.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CATHOLIC CHURCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The big wooden doors open to release the parishioners inside. Feature a tall, lanky 18-YEAR-OLD. Holding his GIRLFRIEND'S hand, anxious for Sunday to really begin. They don't notice the traffic suddenly thin, like a faucet's been cranked down. They move toward a Mercedes 500. As a CHAUFFEUR holds the back door open for them...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A GRAND MARQUIS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Squeals around the corner, lurches to a stop alongside the Mercedes. FOUR MEN get out flashing badges. In a moment they're hustling Eighteen toward the car, stiff- arming the chauffeur. As the girlfriend cries and the gossip among the parishioners begins...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Grand Marquis pulls away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GRAND MARQUIS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They shove eighteen down to the floor of the backseat. These guys are not the police.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A switchblade is flicked open. Practiced hands slit the boy's Sunday suit from the base of his neck to his heels. Eighteen yelps as the blade draws blood across one calf.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Duct tape is wrapped around his hands, eyes, and head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WOODED AREA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Marquis is parked across from another CAR. FOUR NEW GUYS wait as Eighteen is hauled out of the Marquis. His clothes drop away like a snake shedding its skin. He stands naked, bound and blind. Eighteen is handed over from one group to the other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TELEPHONE - UPSCALE HOME - MEXICO CITY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The phone rings. A bomb going off. Eighteen's distraught FATHER (family photos of the boy on the wall) answers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE TO REVEAL a battery of POLICE and NEGOTIATORS in the room with him. One of them listens in, waves fingers at him as the negotiations begin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VIDEO SURVEILLANCE OF AN 8' X 4' CELL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A wall smeared with God-knows-what. Facing it, Eighteen stands naked blindfolded and shivering. The back of his leg still bleeds. He shifts nervously as a little JACK RUSSELL TERRIER eagerly licks the blood off his calf.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MAN ('The Dreamer'), we don't see his face, negotiates by cell phone. Voice calm. As he runs numbers, he slaps his thigh. Jack Russell trots over, gets an ear scratched.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At a motion from the man, Eighteen is taken down to the ground. Straddled by two men, his head is mummified in tape leaving one ear exposed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO T.V. - Rosanna Garcia Guerrero, editor of REFORMA newspaper, being interviewed, "...organized crime syndicates...growth of kidnapping in Mexico over the last two years."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. UPSCALE HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As a hand removes a ziplock baggie from the mailbox. A glimpse of something we don't want to see. An ear partially obscured by sweating plastic and a blood smear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CITY SQUARE - MEXICO CITY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MERCEDES driving around the square, Eighteen's father waving a white shirt out the window like a surrender flag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT (3 AM)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Footbridge over railway sandwiched between freeway. Empty train blazes through. Dangerous, deserted downtown neighborhood. Looks more like "war torn Beirut", burnt out cars and trash. The 18 year old's father, naked to the waist, walks from the family Mercedes over the footbridge carrying a pillowcase full of cash to a semi- derelict car on the opposite side with a white piece of fabric taped in the rear windshield and trunk open. He slams the pillow case in the trunk and leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DOWNTOWN MEXICO CITY - TWILIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RUSH HOUR. A red stream of headlights separated from a white stream of taillights by a narrow median.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HORNS blare as a CAR stops. Eighteen, still blindfolded, is dumped on the median. The car pulls away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stands there in the whirlwind. Pathetically SCREAMING for help. More horns, shouts, no help.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
END MAIN TITLES. Goes to black.

Samuel Valencia Ramos and his lawyer Jordan Kalfus in the privacy of an alcove table. Jordan is well heeled, well connected and well oiled. In that order.

Samuel sits at his baby grand piano playing a gentle rendering of 'Delibes'. His American wife LISA stands away from him. Just the sight of her back reveals a pitch perfect petulance. She tells him:
</DIRECTION>

	A man's worth can be judged by what he has or what he owes. Only the amount matters.

	And bankruptcy. Where will that put me in the social strata?

Samuel finally follows the logic.

EXT. CORRIDOR - MEXICO CITY AIRPORT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As a 747 is towed by in the background, a MAN strides at us. CREASY. Even in movement, he has a stillness, an air of isolation. He's set apart from other living things.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He wears dark sunglasses, carries a well-worn leather bag. Inscrutable. Disconnected. A bit frightening. The discipline of a soldier. The independence of a gunslinger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Automatic baggage teller (Red Light, Green Light). Creasy feeds the machine with his perforated customs card. Light flashes RED.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUSTOMS MAN
</DIRECTION>

He flips through Creasy's passport. Even the stamps have stamps. Thailand. Somalia. Cuba. Columbia. Hong Kong. Saudi Arabia. Every country in Europe. Guy's been around.

<CUSTOMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I cannot see your eyes, Senor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CUSTOMS>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy slips off the sunglasses. His eyes are deserted. Inevitable. Customs can only look into them a moment. He indicates for Creasy to put his bags on a conveyor belt leading to an X-ray machine. Creasy lifts his bag onto the conveyor. The official hits the start button. The bag drives forward towards the X-ray machine.

Creasy pauses, then offers up a license from his wallet.

	How does it affect you?

</SAMUEL>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My coordination. Reaction time. If top professionals try to kidnap your daughter, the service will be on par with the pay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<SAMUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what if amateurs try it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMUEL>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll probably kill them. Is that likely?

</CREASY>
<SAMUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. And no one is to know of your drinking problem. That includes my wife.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Where Lisa is flipping through TV channels; Sky News, CNN, etc... Each one showing some terrorist act - West Bank protest, Madrid car bombing.

Samuel and Creasy, meanwhile, enter behind her. She clicks it off, looks back at them.

Lisa steps over, shakes Creasy's hand. Gives him a quick once over.
</DIRECTION>
<LISA>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you like a drink?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy doesn't hesitate, doesn't look at Samuel and has no irony in his answer.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you. Scotch and a little water.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
She steps to the bar to make it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CREASY - FROM SOMEONE'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slightly sinister. Watching from the frame of the door.
</DIRECTION>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've done much of this work before?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
Samuel sells, covers for Creasy's reticence.
</DIRECTION>
<SAMUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He has experience in related work. A great deal of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMUEL>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you have any family, Mr. Creasy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy hesitates for an imperceptible beat.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I do not have family.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
And then, somehow, Creasy is aware of being watched. His eyes flicker over, just in time to see...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PINTA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Crouched low. In the doorway. She stares back at him a beat, then disappears around the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SITTING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy frowns. Lisa steps over with Creasy's drink.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
She makes a point of looking into his eyes. Creasy looks back into hers with complete indifference, something she has not experienced even from dying men.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She abruptly turns away. Confused for a moment. Finally:
</DIRECTION>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pinta!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<DIRECTION>
A few moments and Pinta arrives. 'Cool Hand Pinta'.
</DIRECTION>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, mom?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is Mr. Creasy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<DIRECTION>
Pinta walks over and very formally holds out her hand. Creasy shakes it. An odd beat.
</DIRECTION>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pinta, show him to his room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<DIRECTION>
Samuel reacts. Creasy got the job.
</DIRECTION>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This way, Mr. Creasy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<DIRECTION>
What an actress. As he follows her out. Samuel sits at his baby grand and begins to play.
</DIRECTION>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think it's nice he's American.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<SAMUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think it's fantastic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMUEL>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You realize that you've brought a killer into the house.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<DIRECTION>
Samuel is stopped short by that one. She steps over and kisses her husband on the cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you. I feel better now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<DIRECTION>
EXT./INT. HOUSE - SUNSET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pinta leads the way. All enthusiasm, away from her parents. A 150 pound black German Shepherd greets them. Sniffs Creasy's pant leg, unsure.
</DIRECTION>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you like dogs, Mr. Creasy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If they like me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frank doesn't take to most people. Do you speak German?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<CREASY>

(in German)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ein Klines Bisschen. [A tiny bit.]
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frank only responds to commands in German. He was trained in Frankfurt. My Dad loves the idea of having a dog around, but hates the fact he lives inside.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy follows her. Frank pads along after them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CREASY'S ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Not like downstairs, but comfortable enough.
</DIRECTION>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We fixed the room up two weeks ago. Mom and I. It's nicer than before.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy takes a stroll around it, ignoring her.
</DIRECTION>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've got a CD player if you like music. I like music a lot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<DIRECTION>
CAW! Creasy looks over at a CAGE on a stand holding a MACAW. It tilts its head at the big man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A TV and VHS machine in the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's 'Bird.' Emilio forgot to take him with when he left.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's Emilio?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My last bodyguard. He drove me to school in the morning and picked me up in the afternoon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<DIRECTION>
Finally Creasy turns, looks at her hard.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm here for you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
Pinta smiles huge, nods.
</DIRECTION>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In between you can take Mom shopping and to lunch. Does that sound alright, Mr. Creasy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Creasy. Just call me Creasy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<PINTA>
<DIRECTION>
(big grin)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Creasy...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<DIRECTION>
Frank's tail wags imperceptibly.
</DIRECTION>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looks like he approves of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<DIRECTION>
And then, walking on air, she's out the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy sets up his room with meticulous precision that comes from years in the military. Front and center he arranges his shrine: an almost empty bottle of scotch and a glass (engraved from an earlier encounter) next to a pack of Marlboros and his weathered Zippo. Then, his beaten up gun and holster. A well-travelled New Testament is placed in the drawer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CREASY'S BAG
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches in between the shirts, pulls out a fresh bottle of scotch. He breaks the seal, unscrews the cap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pours a double... triple... wait, what do you call a full glass of scotch?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAW! The macaw squawks it's disapproval.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He ejects the shell from the breach of the 9mm, tries to catch it on the back of his hand. An old game with himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His hand is too shaky. The bullet bounces off, hits the floor. Creasy picks it up. Ejecting the magazine, he starts to oil the weapon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAW! As the macaw squawks, Creasy looks up. It doesn't feel like this relationship is going to work.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PINTA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A battered TEDDY BEAR watches as Lisa sits on the foot of the bed, tucks Pinta in.
</DIRECTION>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	School tomorrow, baby.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<DIRECTION>
Pinta smiles, happy at the thought.
</DIRECTION>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like him, Mom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's like a great big bear.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a secret smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Creasy bear'...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<DIRECTION>
Lisa smiles, kisses her goodnight. As she starts out...
</DIRECTION>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's something about him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<DIRECTION>
Lisa turns, looks back at her daughter.
</DIRECTION>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think he's been sick. He's alright now, but I think he's been very, very sick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, think about going to sleep. Good night, baby.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<DIRECTION>
Lisa exits. Pinta looks over at the battered teddy bear.
</DIRECTION>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just like you, a big old bear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CREASY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In his room. Tests his mag spring with his thumb, begins loading up. The full magazine joins with those already loaded.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another glass of scotch is poured.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy's hands oil the holster. The Sig Sauer is slipped in. The holster is hung over the corner post of the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A map is flattened. Creasy's finger traces various routes, pencils them in. From the house to Pinta's school.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The macaw squawks again. Creasy steps over, takes the cage and carries it to the open window. He opens the cage door.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now's your chance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
The bird flies, disappears out the window.

INT. LISA & SAMUEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Spent, glistened in sweat, the couple lay side by side.
</DIRECTION>
<LISA>

</LISA>
<SAMUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>

Lisa just smiles, knows her daughter better.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CREASY'S ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy's drinking in the dark next to the window, listening to the sounds of Mexico City at night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The empty scotch glass is set down. Ominously sober.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PINTA'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brushing her hair, Pinta wanders to the window at the sound of a car hood closing. Creasy is down below going over the car; a dark BLUE MERCEDES. As he checks underneath...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The "Car Wash Guy", Pedro, trying to engage Creasy. Frank looks on, seems like he disapproves of Pedro.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MERCEDES - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy sits grimly behind the wheel. Pinta exuberant beside him. Traveling route number one from home base to school. Pinta looks at Creasy's hands on the wheel. The back of the right one is swirled with scars.
</DIRECTION>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are you from, Creasy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The United States.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. But which state?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy checks the rearview mirror. A banged up white TOYOTA COROLLA pulls out behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No state in particular.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
Pinta frowns; this is going to take some work.
</DIRECTION>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My mom and me are from Houston, Texas. Have you been there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy has his eyes on the mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>

<PINTA>

	<DIALOGUE>
	No.

	Why not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm looking for potential.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy checks the mirror. The white Corolla continues the way it was going. False alarm.
</DIRECTION>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Potential? I don't understand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Places where the road bends, places away from buildings, places where the traffic thins out. But you don't have to understand. I do. So no talking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you going to quit? My last bodyguard quit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me guess, you wouldn't stop talking?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Someone gave him more money than we could.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a bargain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Being black, is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in Mexico?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Time will tell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City in the last six days. Four a day. What do you think about that, Mr. Creasy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pretty impressive. Maybe I need to up my fee or get a larger gun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at his scared right hand, then him. All curiosity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CONVENT SCHOOL GATES - MEXICO CITY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy pulls the Mercedes up out front. He notes the high walls, the heavy gates.
</DIRECTION>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Beep the horn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy hits it. A beat and then a shutter opens at eye level. Pinta waves from the car. A moment later the gate is being slowly pushed open by an old WATCHMAN. Creasy drives in toward a rambling, ivy-clad building set in spacious grounds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COURTYARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy parks, get out of the car. He looks around, appraising the lay of the land.
</DIRECTION>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Isn't it beautiful?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<DIRECTION>
Pinta's name is called. An elderly gray-haired NUN walks over from the entrance. Pinta runs over, kiss her warmly on both cheeks, then leads her toward Creasy.
</DIRECTION>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sister Anna, the headmistress.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to nun; proudly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is Creasy, my bodyguard.

Sister Anna shakes his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<SISTER_ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Creasy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SISTER_ANNA>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Sister, he told me just to call him Creasy. He's American. From no state in particular.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<SISTER_ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must look after our Pinta. We're so happy to have her back in school. Run along now, Pinta.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SISTER_ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
Pinta waves goodbye, bounds away. They watch her go.
</DIRECTION>
<SISTER_ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's late, Mr. Creasy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SISTER_ANNA>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I've got to get used to the routes. I -- It won't happen again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<SISTER_ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No offense, but I'm sorry that your profession needs to exist.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SISTER_ANNA>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So am I, Sister.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<SISTER_ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you ever see the hand of God in what you do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SISTER_ANNA>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not for a long time, sister.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<SISTER_ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The bible says, "Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good."
	</DIALOGUE>
</SISTER_ANNA>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Romans, chapter 12, verse 21.

Sister Anna is impressed. She nods her 'props' to Creasy.

INT. MERCEDES - CONVENT SCHOOL GATES - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy pulls out, starts down the street. He's only gone a hundred meters when SIRENS kick up. A police car behind him. Creasy shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here we go again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy pulls over, digs around the front seat as TWO SLOPPY COPS head over.
</DIRECTION>
<SLOPPY_COP_ONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you speak English, Senor?

</CREASY>
<SLOPPY_COP_ONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have an identification?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SLOPPY_COP_ONE>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy hands them his PASSPORT and a printed LETTER. A legitimate firearms license for bodyguard work witnessed by Rayburn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy deliberately puts one hand on the steering wheel, then the other. Minimizing the confrontation.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a temporary license for the gun I'm carrying. I just went through all of this at the airport.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BIG BURLY SUV - DRIVING TOWARD THE BORDER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Six Japanese BUSINESSMEN jabber on cellphones. Rayburn's daily routine. He sits up front an Uzi cradled in his lap. As his own cell phone rings, he answers.
</DIRECTION>
<RAYBURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rayburn here. Creasy, what's up?

INT. BAR - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Creasy slams a Jack and Coke.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HIGH STREET - MEXICO CITY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy striding, the frivolous shoppers like another species as he moves through them. Might as well wear a shark fin. He spots something: a MUSIC STORE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MUSIC STORE - MEXICO CITY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy finds the section he's looking for, searches a rack. There. As he pulls a particular CD, we are not privy to what it is.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COURTYARD - PINTA'S SCHOOL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy waits, smoking a Marlboro light, separate from the other drivers and bodyguards. The bodyguards stand together sharing cigarettes and stories. Give him a share of unfriendly looks. Creasy could care less.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The doors open and the children pour out. PINTA exits, a huge grin as she spots Creasy. Creasy palms the Marlboro. The frown on his might as well be chiseled in marble.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MERCEDES - ROLLING -DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pinta rides shotgun alongside Creasy. She looks out the window, realizes...
</DIRECTION>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're taking a different way home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right.

Pinta thinks about it, realizes what he's doing, smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I understand. Smart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<DIRECTION>
No answer from Creasy. It's hard not to feel foolish around this kid.

<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hmmm?

<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It wasn't a school like yours and there was no Sister Anna.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you were unhappy?
	</DIALOGUE>

<CREASY>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<DIRECTION>
Pinta watches Creasy a moment, trying to figure a way in. She looks at his scarred right hand on the wheel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, as she reaches out...
</DIRECTION>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened to...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<DIRECTION>
And touches it.
</DIRECTION>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...your hand?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy gives her a look, devoid of humanity for an instant.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No more questions.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
When he speaks again he's colder; he's decided something.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not paid to be your friend. I'm paid to protect you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
They drive on in silence. Creasy finally glances over. Pinta stares straight ahead, her chin quivering.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
(exasperated)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And don't start crying.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not crying.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<DIRECTION>
But she is. As Creasy stops at a red light...
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, this is the way I am. I don't like questions. I --
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
And she's out the door.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy shoulders open his door, bolts out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERSECTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy has barely straightened himself and Pinta is already getting back in the car. This time in the backseat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy sighs. The light goes green. Scooters whine away and horns blare.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MERCEDES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy sits back behind the wheel.
</DIRECTION>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can take me home now, Mr. Creasy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy looks back at her, but she stares straight ahead. As the chorus of horns continues, Creasy continues driving.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN - RAMOS VILLA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy sits at the table with the old gardener GOMEZ (we've seen him trimming hedges and such in earlier exteriors). Gomez's just cleaned his plate and is going after any remnants with a crust of bread. Creasy hasn't touched his.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARIA, the cook, enters. As she clocks Creasy's plate...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CREASY'S ROOM - SUNSET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
'Chopin' drifts across the courtyard. Samuel is a very accomplished player.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy sits in a chair in the twilight by the window, a glass of scotch in his hand. A knock at the door.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens. It's Lisa.
</DIRECTION>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Creasy, I wanted to make sure you have everything you need.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is the food alright? Maria tells me that you didn't eat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The food's fine. Sometimes I don't eat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<LISA>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It insults Maria. Slip it to the dog if you have to... Do you mind if I talk to you for a moment?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<DIRECTION>
He shakes his head. Lisa glides into the room like a dancer, sits down at the foot of the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How are you getting along with Pinta?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll be okay once she realizes I'm not a new toy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<LISA>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, she told me. Do you have children, Mr. Creasy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should know they're tenacious when they want something. And Pinta wants to be friends.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're paying me to protect her, not amuse her. Right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
A beat and then Lisa nods.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look. Maybe this isn't going to work. Maybe you should ask your husband to hire someone... more sociable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you're right. You were hired to protect her, that's enough. I'm confident you'll do that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<DIRECTION>
Lisa stands, is about to start out when she sees his gun and holster hanging from the corner of the bed. It gives her pause. Something sexy about it and Creasy's proximity.
</DIRECTION>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't realize you had a gun. I know that's silly to say.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy doesn't answer, just watches her.
</DIRECTION>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It makes it all seem so serious.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is serious, Mrs. Ramos.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, it's Lisa... I'll be coming with you tomorrow. I have lunch with friends.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, Lisa just shrugs and disappears out the door. Creasy slugs down a gulp of scotch.

INT. PINTA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pinta, blankets up, teddy bear beside her, says her prayer.
</DIRECTION>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give me God what you still have. Give me what no one else asks for.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<DIRECTION>
Then, she listens as Linda Ronstadt's "Blue Bayou" starts to drift through the open window, down from the room above.
</DIRECTION>
<RONSTADT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"I'm going back someday, come what may, to Blue Bayou..."
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONSTADT>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CREASY'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stands in the dark, in front of the glow of the stereo. The empty bag from the record store. This is the CD he bought. As the song ends, Creasy hits the back- up button. "Blue Bayou" begins again. Creasy takes the 9mm from its holster. As he sits back in his chair...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PINTA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pinta listens to the music, figures a way to dance to it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CREASY'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy sits in the dark with his 'Blue Bayou'. Creasy does not look right. Holding the 9mm, he ejects the round, tries to catch it on the back of his hand. No good.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He chambers another round. Tries again. Nope.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDA_RONSTADT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well I'll never be blue, my dreams come true, on Blue Bayou...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA_RONSTADT>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PINTA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pinta still dancing, finding a way to be with Creasy whether he knows it or not. Frank, the dog, watches her every move, perplexed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CREASY'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the song repeats, Creasy chambers yet another round. Feels like he misses a beat as he loads one shell into the chamber. Pinta sings along oblivious. Suddenly the barrel is at his forehead and the trigger has been pulled. No gun shot. A click. Hammer against shell. Creasy is confused. He ejects the shell and catches it in the palm of his hand. Macro photograph / a small dimple on the back of the shell is the only evidence of his actions. Pinta still dances.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RAYBURN'S BEDROOM - MEXICO CITY - NIGHT 3.A.M.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rayburn in bed with his beautiful 19-year-old Mexican WIFE and their four-year-old SON.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she leans down to kiss her son, a cellphone rings. Rayburn looks over at the nightstand. FIVE CELLPHONES there, one of them ringing. Rayburn finds it.
</DIRECTION>
<RAYBURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rayburn... Creasy! What's wrong?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYBURN>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RAMOS HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy stands at the edge of the drive, the house dark behind him. On his cell phone.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said, have you ever had a nine millimeter round that just didn't go off?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
INTERCUT THE FOLLOWING:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rayburn pulling away, sitting on the edge of the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<RAYBURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean a misfire?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYBURN>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean nothing. The hammer came down and nothing happened. Dimple on the primer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<RAYBURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've heard of it. Never happened to me though. Maybe the firing pin's off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYBURN>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy is troubled about it all to say the least.
</DIRECTION>
<RAYBURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's like we always used to say: a bullet always tells the truth. What were you shooting at?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYBURN>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy doesn't answer. He holds the bullet up, looks at it.
</DIRECTION>
<RAYBURN>
<DIRECTION>
(focusing; concerned)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Creasy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYBURN>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry I woke you, Ray.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy clicks off the phone. He starts back toward the house, but stops short again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There she is. Pinta. Standing in the window of her room. She's been watching him. It's like Creasy seeing her for the first time. And she's been watching him forever. No easy answer for it. They're connected somehow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CREASY'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fingers putting the special bullet into an old matchbox. It takes it place of honor front and center on the shrine. Next to the Marlboros and scotch. The New Testament is set down nearby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CU - Creasy asleep in his bed for the first time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MERCEDES - ROLLING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Silent Creasy driving. Lisa and Pinta in the back. Creasy steals a look in the mirror. Pinta stares straight ahead. But when Creasy looks away, Pinta steals a look at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - MEXICO CITY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the mercedes crosses an intersection, a white TOYOTA COROLLA turns right, pulls in thirty meters behind it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MERCEDES - ROLLING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy clocks the Corolla, frowns. He pulls a piece of paper from his pocket. But nothing to write with.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pinta, do you have a pencil?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I go to school, don't I?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<DIRECTION>
Sarcasm. He stays calm, doesn't let on what he's thinking.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
Her little hand comes over the top of the seat with a pencil. Creasy takes it, slows to let the Corolla catch up. He squints into the mirror to read the plate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lisa is oblivious, but as Pinta looks back over her shoulder...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BRAKE LIGHTS up ahead. Creasy lurches to a stop. The Corolla swerves around them disappears ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The traffic takes some getting used to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<DIRECTION>
As Creasy cranes for a view, another WHITE Corolla comes by headed the opposite way. They're everywhere. This relaxes Creasy's paranoia. As he laughs to himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COURTYARD - CONVENT SCHOOL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They pull in through the gates. The Mercedes parks; Creasy gets out. Pinta kisses her mother on the cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bye, Mom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't forget your towel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<DIRECTION>
Pinta gets out with book bag and her towel. As she starts to walk past Creasy without a word, he holds out her pencil. She holds up, shows him a SECOND PENCIL, continues on her way. Doesn't need him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MERCEDES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy gets back in, starts away.
</DIRECTION>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She has swimming practice today. You'll need to pick her up at the pool.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy just nods. He doesn't want anything to do with Lisa either. Thoughtful, Lisa looks out the window.
</DIRECTION>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I talked to her. She understands. She won't bother you anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<DIRECTION>
As Creasy just drives.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. AGO'S - MEXICO CITY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy waits in the street, stands by the Mercedes. He checks his watch, looks around. The minutes do not pass quickly. He looks over as the restaurant door opens and Lisa exits with Jordan Kalfus and his Latin wife EVELYN.
</DIRECTION>
<LISA>
<DIRECTION>
(sees him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Creasy!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(stepping over)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Meet Jordan and Evelyn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy nods. They study him with interest.
</DIRECTION>
<JORDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you're the bodyguard?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Creasy nods again)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You used to be, what did they used to call it, a soldier of fortune?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JORDAN>
<DIRECTION>
Jordan doesn't quite hide his disdain. Creasy nods a final time, lets his eyes drift to a 1000 yard stare.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
(giggles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does he talk?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
As Lisa gives her a dirty look, Evelyn whispers...
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's sexy...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
Jordan looks in the direction Creasy looks.
</DIRECTION>
<JORDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see any danger out there?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The fear's worse than the reality.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JORDAN>
<DIRECTION>
Just a blankness from Creasy.
</DIRECTION>
<JORDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I always wanted to ask a bodyguard, would you take a bullet for your employer, for Samuel?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JORDAN>
<DIRECTION>
A condescending smile as Jordan awaits his answer.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wasn't hired to guard Mr. Ramos.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<JORDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For Pinta then?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JORDAN>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jordan!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If something happened, my reaction would be to fight to protect her. I have skills in that respect. Pinta would benefit by the fact that... I'm a soldier.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<JORDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What kind of an answer is that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JORDAN>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The answer is the truth. The question is foolish.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
Lisa smiles at the answer, kisses Jordan on the cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jordan, thank you for the lovely lunch. I promise not to let Evelyn spend too much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn doesn't see it, but Creasy does. Jordan just lets his fingers trace the top of Lisa's ass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she and Evelyn head for the car, Creasy is there to open the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MERCEDES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy gets behind the wheel. Pulls into traffic. As he goes, he checks the rear view mirror. Jordan remains standing on the curb watching the car pull away. Something odd about it all.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PUBLIC POOL - MEXICO CITY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Loud. Chaotic. Reminiscent of a lunatic asylum. Creasy arrives at the public pool. A practice. Several bodyguards gather at one end of the pool. Give Creasy a less than friendly look. As he looks for Pinta...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A GUN goes off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sees: The smoke from the starting pistol as the SWIMMERS splash into the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sees Pinta in the pool. The fifty yard dash. She's in fifth. Then fourth. Creasy walks along beside her. Third. Second and closing. And at the wall, still second.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She surfaces, frustrated. As she sees Creasy there...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MERCEDES - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy drives. Pinta in back, writing in her notebook. Not speaking, but a weird sort of harmony. Finally.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're fast.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Once I get in the water but not starting off. By the time I catch up, it's too late.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<DIRECTION>
She keeps writing. The number "2" over and over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CREASY'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy sits in his chair drinking scotch. All alone needless to say.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy takes the instructional VHS on bodyguards that Rayburn gave him and plugs it into the VCR. It's in Japanese. Shakes his head. He switches off the VCR and surfs the TV channels instead. Sees talk show with the editor of REFORMA newspaper, ROSANNA GUERRERO, talking about organized crime in Mexico.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From out the window, a CAW, then again. Yet again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, Creasy stands goes to the window. He leans out, sees Pinta's window across the lawn from him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pinta standing on the terrace. Another CAW.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy decides to play. He CAWS in return.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pinta looks around. Creasy does a pretty good impersonation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hears Pinta CAW again.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey... Pinta...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
She looks up at him.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Calling for Emilio's macaw. I thought I heard him.

</PINTA>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you think he'll come back?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe. Did you hear him?

</PINTA>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I let him go.

</CREASY>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's better to be free, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Actually, he was driving me crazy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy disappears back inside. Pinta smiles big before letting the stick drop to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got you to talk, Creasy bear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<DIRECTION>
Blue Bayou plays. Pinta now listens to Creasy's sound.

	You enjoy it for us, Pinta.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMUEL>
<DIRECTION>
Lisa gives her a look. Don't make this harder than it has to be. Finally, Pinta nods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy waits quite a discreet distance away by the Mercedes. She steps over, stops to wave goodbye one last time, then gets in back. As Creasy shuts the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MERCEDES - MEXICO CITY ROAD - DAY
</DIRECTION>

Creasy drives, glances in the mirror at Pinta in the back seat. She wipes away a tear just as it forms.

<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They'll be back in a week.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They can stay for two weeks. I don't care.

She's got a toughness Creasy likes. As she looks out the window, he looks ahead.

Creasy eats.

Maria beams with pleasure.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My pleasure, Creasy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIA>
<DIRECTION>
Pinta enters in a RED SATIN DEVIL'S OUTFIT. She looks a bit forlorn as she sits at opposite ends of the table from Creasy. As she stares at her plate, Creasy starts to laugh at what an odd sight she is. All dressed up and no place to go.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wrong move. Pinta stands, marches out of the room. As Maria and Creasy exchange a look...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT./INT. WINDOW - RAMOS VILLA - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Pinta the devil stares sadly out here window. Then there it is! The macaw. Sitting on the opposite roof.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ATTIC WINDOW - RAMOS VILLA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pinta pushes it open, climbs out onto the slope of the roof. This doesn't look like such a good idea. As she crosses, disappears over the peak.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a game of catch me if you can. 'Bird' looks at Pinta right in the eye. She gingerly moves closer. The bird moves away, just out of her reach each time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHIMNEY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pinta coming down the other slope. There's the macaw.
</DIRECTION>
<PINTA>

	Come on. Come on. Bird!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<DIRECTION>
The fourth time Pinta's fingers are centimeters away. She reaches and suddenly slides along the slick tile covering this section of the roof. Frank's in the yard barking loudly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Near the edge, she manages to stop. Whew!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She scrambles up a few feet. A tile snaps off. She slides again. This time right off the edge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She catches the rain gutter. Hangs thirty feet above the ground. A concrete landing below. As the gutter creaks:

Creasy dashes around just as the gutter drops on one side. Pinta drops ten feet, jerks to a stop as the gutter stops, then drops the last twenty feet...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...landing in a hedge. Creasy dashes over.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pinta!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
She's in a lot of pain, but moving her arms and head. Frank's licking her face.
</DIRECTION>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It hurts.

She puts her hands to the left side of her ribs. Creasy carefully probes with his fingers. She winces.

<CREASY>

	I don't think they're broken. Anywhere else?

As Maria huffs and puffs her way up.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to get you out, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
Pinta nods. Creasy eases his arms under, around her, lifts her out as gently as possible. She disappears in his arms.
</DIRECTION>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Creasy...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<DIRECTION>
And she bursts into tears. Maria looks up at the thirty foot fall. Begins to cross herself.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay. She's just scared.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy cradles her, pats her back. As Pinta says his name like a mantra...

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He took her for an X-ray, but it's just a bruise and a sprain.

PINTA'S BEDROOM

<DIRECTION>
Pinta in bed propped up by a pillow, teddy bear beside her. Frank at the head of the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The night you arrived, Mom asked you if you had a family and you lied, didn't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	White lie. I didn't have a family. But I did have two kids. They're adults now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
It's a sensitive subject so Pinta moves on. She nods. Creasy looks at the bear. An odd beat.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you always sleep with him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm too old for him. Don't tell my friends.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't talk to them much. Does he have a name?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
Pinta thinks just a beat, then shakes her head 'no'. Liar.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I spoke to your mother. She sends her love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
Pinta nods. Creasy stands there a beat, then heads for the door. Almost out, he looks back.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some bodyguard I turned out to be. Good night, Pinta.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>

He's halfway out the door.
</DIRECTION>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Creasy? Could you play the song?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy is confused a moment, but when he sees her open window, he realizes.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Blue Bayou. You got it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
He goes. As Pinta eases back with a sigh and a smile...

EXT. MERCEDES - RAMOS HOUSE - DAY

Pedro the 'car wash guy' puts the finishing touches to the Mercedes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Using crutches, Pinta hobbles over. Creasy opens the back door for her. But when she gets there, she hesitates.
</DIRECTION>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I'll sit in the front. There's more room for my foot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy makes no big deal of it. He takes her crutches, opens the front. As she scoots inside... Frank waits and watches. Creasy calls to him.
</DIRECTION>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's only allowed to travel in the car on weekends. Dad says the car will smell 'doggie'.

</CREASY>
<PINTA>

<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's the ankle? Can you put your weight on it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not too bad. Will it take a long time before it's better? Our big swim meet is in three weeks. Interschools. I was going to swim in the one hundred meter freestyle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In a week you should be fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>

They drive on a few silent beats, until...

<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doesn't matter. I always finish second.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You need to practice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>

Pinta looks at him hopefully, but Creasy catches himself. He's not going to coach a little girl. Finally...

Gomez, Maria and Creasy again joined by Pinta. As Creasy places a fork of meat into his mouth...
</DIRECTION>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Creasy, what's a concubine?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy opens his mouth, takes the fork of meat back out.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you ask?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was in a book at school. Concubine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<DIRECTION>
Maria and Gomez wait to see how he'll answer.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it's a sort of wife.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But the Emperor of China had 1000 of them! How can that be?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In the West, it's one wife for one husband, but different cultures have different rules.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It must be difficult having lots of wives.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<CREASY>

	You feel sorry for the husband?

<PINTA>

(in Spanish)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Can you imagine my mother multiplied by a thousand?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<DIRECTION>
Maria and Gomez burst out laughing. So funny that Creasy smiles. Pinta lights up at the sight. A huge victory.
</DIRECTION>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Creasy, you're smiling.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<DIRECTION>
He reverts to a frown. Now Pinta bursts out laughing. And Creasy can't help but smile again.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess I am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
Pinta changes subject.
</DIRECTION>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So how come you know so much about those countries?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had to do my homework on them when I worked there. Also I enjoy history.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>

In her swimsuit and cap, Pinta crouches in makeshift starting blocks.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>

</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
Pinta takes off. Splashes into the water. Not to Creasy's satisfaction.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no, come back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
Pinta turns in the water, looks back at him.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't flinch when a gun goes off; you react. You go. Don't listen for the sound; don't anticipate it. Concentrate on the sound itself.

	I don't understand.

</PINTA>
<CREASY>

Shivering, Creasy throws a towel around her and rubs her down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MERCEDES - ROLLING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the way to school. Pinta is stealing looks at Creasy's right hand. She knows the answer must be serious, but she has to ask.
</DIRECTION>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Creasy, what happened to your hand?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy looks at her a moment, deciding. Pinta practically holds her breath, watches him, knows the answer may come. Creasy checks the mirror, watches the road.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A man asked me questions once. He smoked a lot. There was no ashtray.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
That's it. End of explanation. Creasy continues watching the road. Pinta watches him.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Remember you asked me what state I was from?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.

	Where you're from isn't so much about geography; it's about events. Where you're from is what happened to you.

	Good things happen, too, Creasy.

INT. 3RD FLOOR HALLWAY - RAMOS VILLA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lisa walking toward Creasy's room. As she moves to knock, she sees the door is ajar, hears voices. She peeks in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy and Pinta sit on the floor, pencils, papers and a book spread out before them. Doing her history homework.
</DIRECTION>

LISA'S POV - OF CREASY

Lisa continues to watch the little play. She smiles, knocks on the door as she opens it. Pinta and Creasy both look back over their shoulders.
</DIRECTION>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Creasy, tomorrow, after you drop off Pinta, could you come back to take me to get my hair done?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy nods. They both continue to look at her. She gets the feeling she's interrupting.
</DIRECTION>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright, I'll leave you two to your history.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<DIRECTION>
As she goes...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HAIRDRESSERS - ZONA ROSA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mexico City traffic is heavy. Cars and people. Creasy stands by the car across the street. Cooling his heels. He can just catch a glimpse of Lisa in the shop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the traffic seems to finish, expending itself. The street goes ominously quiet. Creasy's antennae go up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A police car comes prowling down the empty street. Creasy makes eye contact with the guys up front.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, Creasy spots a BUSINESSMAN coming out of a doorway with a BODYGUARD attached. The bodyguard is speaking into a two-way radio.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy's sixth sense tweaks as a Mercedes 500 pulls up to collect the businessman.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And the cop car disappears around the corner even as TWO MEN start toward the businessman.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lisa exits the hairdresser's. Looks stunning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy starts across the street toward her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A second car squeals around the corner behind the Mercedes and everything goes to Hell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GUNFIRE erupts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then Creasy is there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His arm around Lisa's waist, sweeping her off her feet. The next thing she knows she flattened on the ground in a shop doorway, Creasy on top of her. Shielding her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bodyguard beside the businessman is killed. The body guard in the Mercedes trades a full magazine before he's shot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A PEDESTRIAN is killed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Liza screams as the glass above and behind them shatters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The businessman is hustled into the back of the second car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lisa sees the gun in Creasy's hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She hears the slamming of the car door, the screeching of tires. A parked VAN also hauling ass out of there. But then she's aware of something else.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy on top of her. She feels his weight, his heat...
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't move.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
She watches as he rises, goes to the curb. One bodyguard is sprawled dead across the ground. Red blood on the sidewalk. As Lisa closes her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MERCEDES - STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lisa sits in the backseat. Through the window we can see Creasy wrap up his statement to a member of the JUDICIAL POLICE. Finally he gets in the car, starts to drive.
</DIRECTION>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Murdering people in the street... You had your gun, why didn't you shoot them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<DIRECTION>
The shoulders in front of her just shrug.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing to do with me. Or you. Besides, there was another one in the passenger side of the van with a sawed-off shotgun. If I'd started shooting his friends, he would've had me. And you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
Quiet a beat. Lisa pulls a sliver of glass from her hair, looks from it to Creasy.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A minimum close protection team consists of four men for high threat targets and environments. Even in a low threat situation, you need two guards plus a security trained driver.

She shakes involuntarily. It's hitting her. As they make eye contact through the mirror...

EXT. HIGHWAY UNDERPASS - MEXICO CITY - DAY

Creasy doesn't answer, just grunts. Pinta keeps looking at him and it suddenly all makes sense.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks over at her, starts to say something, then thinks better of it. Finally...
</DIRECTION>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you think my mother likes you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<DIRECTION>
She's for sure pissed. Definitely aware and definitely jealous. Creasy's a bit amazed, not sure how to respond.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think she's afraid of me. But not the same way most people are.
	</DIALOGUE>

Pinta considers this. Then..

<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>

Heated. Steam rising off the water. PINTA stands with her eyes closed. Creasy, standing beside her, brings TWO BLOCKS together with a WHACK!
</DIRECTION>

Pinta flinches at the sound. She opens her eyes, shrugs an apology at him. Creasy frowns, shakes his head. Pinta closes her eyes again. He starts walking around her. Frank oversees the whole program.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The gunshot holds no fear. Say it.

Eyes closed, she's drifted off with his voice. And Creasy WHACKS them together right in front of her face.

Pinta smiles at the sound. Creasy smiles at the sight.

WHACK! Pinta bolts from the blocks. SPLASHES.

WHACK! WHACK! WHACK! Pinta surges. Pinta arcs. Pinta knifes into the water.

Pinta touches the far wall of the pool, the finish line. Creasy checks his watch, claps.

Creasy's finger presses play. "Blue Bayou" begins. Plaintive, haunting. As he moves to sit in his chair, he passes the scotch bottle. It has gone unopened.

He ejects the shell from the breach of the 9mm, smoothly catches it on the back of his hand. Rock steady. Frank's tail wags.

	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy shrugs. No comforting answer for her. He looks around at some of the other bodyguards.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good luck. I'll be waiting here when you're done.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
But she's shaking her head adamantly. Determined.
</DIRECTION>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're coming with me.

EXT. SWIMMING MEET - MUNICIPAL POOL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A big MARQUEE has been set up alongside the pool. Coltish girls in swimsuits. Parents socialize, drink cocktails. Richly dressed. Bodyguards and security are outside of it, on the perimeter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy looks completely out of place.
</DIRECTION>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stand near the finish line.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<DIRECTION>
Pinta starts away.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pinta.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
She turns, looks back at him.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The blocks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<PINTA>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles; knows)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a prisoner in them. Until the gunshot sets me free.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy nods. He smiles. He's serious now. As he watches her head off for the track, Sister Anna steps up.
</DIRECTION>
<SISTER_ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Creasy, nice to see you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SISTER_ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
And now Creasy is completely out of place.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
(apologetic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pinta's parents are in Los Angeles. I was going to wait in the courtyard, but...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
She takes his arm, pats his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<SISTER_ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Today you are her father.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SISTER_ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
As Creasy lets this sink in, looks out where Pinta is warming up. Sister Anna smiles, heads off to a group of parents. We're left with Creasy. Confused Creasy. But clarity is creeping in. As the sky opens up around him...
</DIRECTION>

Pointed up at precisely 45 degrees. BAAAANGG!

STARTING BLOCKS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eyes closed serenely, Pinta surges forward, leaving everyone behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CREASY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sees it. She hasn't even hit the water and he already knows she's won.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PINTA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SPLASH! Ten meters in before she breaks the surface. Her head sweeping left and then right.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wherever her competitors are, it's somewhere behind her. And the future, everything ahead, is wide open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TURN WALL - UNDERWATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pinta somersaults, kicks off and is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SURFACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And the finish line seems to come to her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CROWD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cheers enthusiastically as she reaches the finish wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CREASY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watches her, satisfied with what he's done.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pinta hauls herself out of the water and runs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beeline for Creasy. And the poor fucker doesn't even understand, until she's leaping the last few feet...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Into his arms.
</DIRECTION>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I won, Creasy! I won!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<DIRECTION>
She loves him... Creasy hugs her. He loves her back.

INT. TRADITIONAL RESTAURANT - MEXICO CITY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MARIACHI BAND roams. We see Creasy but not who he's with. A date? As we come around it's Pinta. Sitting with them, Rayburn and his wife. And a sleeping four- year-old.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NOTE: Rethink following dialogue with reference to Creasy / Rayburn background.
</DIRECTION>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My Dad said all your friends were dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<RAYBURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All but one. The most important one. When we were eighteen, we made an agreement to "take the world" together.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYBURN>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then one day, he calls and says, 'I'm in love and I'm moving to Mexico.' I said what happened to the plan?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<RAYBURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said the plan was right here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYBURN>
<DIRECTION>
Rayburn looks at beautiful 19-year-old Alicia and their four-year-old son sleeping.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hung up on him. When I met Alicia, I got it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
Alicia blows Creasy a kiss.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I kiss her now, or after you've gone to bed?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
Laughter.
</DIRECTION>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, I think now is as good as time as any.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<DIRECTION>
She takes out a velvet pouch from her pocket. She holds it out to Creasy. He looks at her, takes it from her hand. His thick fingers fumble with a delicate drawstring.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pinta waits for his reaction as Creasy pours a simple, but fine MEDALLION and chain into the palm of his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I bought it with my own money. I saved it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy is really affected, tries to hide it. She takes it, slips it over his head.
</DIRECTION>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's St. Jude, the patron saint of lost causes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<RAYBURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And hard cases. Creasy's the reason St. Jude became a Saint in the first place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYBURN>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, that's right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy looks at it, considers.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Pinta, it's beautiful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
Pinta kisses him. As the Mariachi band drifts over, Rayburn grabs his wife by the hand.
</DIRECTION>
<RAYBURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, baby. I feel like a third wheel. Watch the kid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYBURN>
<DIRECTION>
They dance. A waiter steps over, refills Creasy's water glass. As he drinks...
</DIRECTION>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could I ask you a question?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could I stop you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't drink like you used to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not a question.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know because I go in your room and check the bottles.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Still not a question.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My mom drinks, too... Why do people drink, Creasy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now that's a question. I don't know about your Mom. For me, the problem isn't in the glass. The problem's in between my ears.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think too much?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Because at one time, I didn't think enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>

Pinta nods, thinks she understands.

INT. AIRPORT - MEXICO CITY - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Samuel and Lisa on the moving escalator. Home from Los Angeles. They look down through the glass, see Creasy waiting for them below. And finally, Lisa frowns.
</DIRECTION>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He has to go, Samuel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<SAMUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? Who?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMUEL>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Creasy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<SAMUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why? You were so pleased with him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMUEL>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pinta likes him too much.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She thinks of him as a father.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<SAMUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's ridiculous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMUEL>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<DIRECTION>
Samuel thinks about it, is almost apologetic.
</DIRECTION>
<SAMUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've just been so busy, Lisa.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMUEL>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He has to go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<DIRECTION>
Samuel looks at her, wonders at her adamancy.
</DIRECTION>
<SAMUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The three month trial ends in a week. I just won't confirm the position. That possibility was understood when I hired him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMUEL>
<DIRECTION>
Lisa gives him a look. She wants it done today. But for once, Samuel is stronger than his wife.
</DIRECTION>
<SAMUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I won't create bad feelings. And another week won't make a difference.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMUEL>
<DIRECTION>
Off the escalator, they turn toward Creasy waiting unaware.
</DIRECTION>
<SAMUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It will be a hard break.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMUEL>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's young. She'll get over it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<SAMUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wasn't thinking of Pinta.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMUEL>
<DIRECTION>
As Lisa looks over at Samuel, he's reaching out his hand, smiling big.
</DIRECTION>
<SAMUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Creasy, how are you?

EXT. RAMOS VILLA- DAY

<DIRECTION>
The sounds of Samuel's baby grand resonates throughout the villa. An impassioned rendering of a Mozart symphony.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pinta is looking for Frank. Today is Saturday and on weekends Frank is allowed to travel with them. And today she is claiming all her rights.
</DIRECTION>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frank. Frankie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>

Pinta whistles.

Creasy driving. Pinta looking noble and brave.

	That's strange. Frank was a no-show. Not like him to miss a ride.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<PINTA>
<DIRECTION>
(distant)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should break all my fingers, Creasy, then tape them back together. I won't be able to play the piano, but I could still swim.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be a baby. You're tougher than that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's no such thing as tough, Creasy. Just trained and untrained.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Then be trained.

	I could do it. Remember the day you wanted the pencil? I know why. And I saw that car again. I wrote the license number in my notebook. Except I missed the last number.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy checks his mirror, nothing back there now. He then looks at Pinta. A bit amazed.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>

	You'll have to show me that number when we get home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. VIA BUENOS AIRES - MEXICO CITY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A wide avenue. The Mercedes pulls up parks in the only open spot. Creasy and Pinta get out. We walks her across the street, along the lawn to the apartment building. They look up at the sound of piano keys tinkling above. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy looks at her, smiles to himself. Pinta looks back.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Continue to play in the wrong key, like you're dyslexic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dyslexic?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like St. Jude. A hopeless case that has a complete block about 'C' Minor. But remember, "Whoever resists authority will bring judgement upon themselves." New Testament, Romans 13.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got that right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll be back in the water in twenty- four hours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy presses the buzzer. As they wait, Pinta sees something, reaches down to pull a DANDELION from a crack where the sidewalk meets the wall. She smiles at Creasy.
</DIRECTION>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For you, Creasy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy takes it from her. He's saved by the bell as a second buzzer answers the first. Creasy pulls the door open. Pinta heaves a resigned sigh.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Remember 'dyslexic.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
As Pinta nods, disappears inside...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
2ND FLOOR WINDOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The curtains rustle in the breeze. The sound of badly played scales. And then sounds of frustration.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, the sound of the teacher playing. Pinta appears in the window for just a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CREASY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looking up from the window of the Mercedes. As Pinta is called back inside, Creasy checks out, twirls the dandelion Pinta gave him. HUMS to himself. "Blue Bayou."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy leaning against the Mercedes. Traffic pounding by. The dandelion is stuck in a button hole of his shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then suddenly traffic thins out. Reminiscent of the previous two kidnappings. It's a process. Creasy straightens up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Judicial POLICE CAR cruises by, slowly. Creasy makes eye contact with the two cops up front. The same guys who were at Zona Rosa.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy starts across the street toward the apartment building. At the same time as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door bangs open. Pinta exiting. She spots Creasy, a huge grin on her face. She was not accepted.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And a white TOYOTA COROLLA coming the other way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The police car reverses back, cutting Creasy off from Pinta. The COPS getting out, big smiles on their faces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE COROLLA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slides to a stop in front of Pinta, blocking her path to Creasy. And as TWO MEN leap out from the backseat...
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
(drawing his 9mm)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Run, Pinta, run!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
But she's rooted with fear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And the men are almost on her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy raises the 9mm overhead. BANG!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And the sound frees her. Pinta runs!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ducking under a flailing arm. Quick and lithe. Trying to reach her bodyguard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cops drawing Uzi's..
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy plants himself, the Sig Sauer now level. He fires twice into COP ONE, dead center in the chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pinta runs. Chased by the TWO MEN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COP TWO returns fire wildly: the Mercedes hit in a ten bullet line.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy fires two more rounds into COP TWO who's hit high in the chest and throat. Precise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy pivots, strides calmly forward, firing at the men chasing Pinta. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MAN ONE goes down, hit in the ribs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bullet slams Creasy in the back, fired from inside the Corolla.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy fires back. BOOM! BOOM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MAN THREE falls dead, hit just below his nose, just above his teeth. The FAT DRIVER fires, now, and Creasy is hit in the shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And Pinta disappears into the traffic. Gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MAN TWO, who has abandoned chasing Pinta, fires again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy drops the 9mm as he is hit in the stomach. He falls to his knees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dandelion starts to come apart. Drifting away, piece by piece.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slack-jawed, Creasy looks about. Sees the FAT DRIVER heaving himself out of the Corolla while MAN TWO scans for Pinta who's nowhere in sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She got away! Creasy smiles even as he crumples over on his side.
</DIRECTION>
<PINTA_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	CREASY!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
And Pinta is back. Running toward Creasy. She can't leave him like this. She was safe and now she's back.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	NOOO...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
She runs to him, wraps her arms around him.
</DIRECTION>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Creasy...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<DIRECTION>
MAN TWO catches up, tears Pinta away, starts back for the sedan. Creasy can only blink after them.
</DIRECTION>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Creasy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<DIRECTION>
It's not a cry for help. It's anguish for him.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pinta...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
MAN TWO crams her in the back seat, follows. The fat driver gets back in behind the wheel. As the door slams shut, wheels spin, grip and the Corolla accelerates away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We just see Pinta look back through the rear windshield. An anguished image before she's pulled back down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy makes a wish. Not for himself, but for her.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't die, Creasy, don't die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
And everything goes very, very,

Sound breaks through first. The whir and beep of medical equipment. And we fade back into:

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MEXICO CITY - DAY

Creasy hooked up. Tubes running in and out of the unconscious man. And he's suddenly surrounded.

A ringing phone sounds like an bomb exploding in the room. A technician answers. Jordan takes the receiver. We hear the conversation. The kidnapper only wants to talk to the father. Everybody is one headsets, monitoring. Samuel listens carefully. Jordan prompts him with hand-written replies on a notepad. Samuel negotiates the amount via notes from his lawyer.

INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - WINDOW OVERLOOKING PRESS CONFERENCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rosanna, the woman we saw on T.V. earlier, stands watching and listening. Incredulous and angry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MIGUEL MANZANO the Director of AFI (also seen earlier on TV), approaches with his two assistants and kisses Rosanna on the cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A bodyguard was shot trying to protect a 9 year old. The bodyguard's American. Not only that he's black.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSANNA>
<MANZANO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that good or bad?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MANZANO>
<ROSANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's good. Really good. He shot and killed two judicial cops and a kidnapper died in the attack. They're saying he's responsible.

Manzano looks bemused, as he eats a sugary pastry. Rosanna heads into the press conference.

The Chief frowns at the sight of Rosanna, knows what a royal pain in the ass she is. Manzano awaits his answer.
</DIRECTION>
<CHIEF>

He turns, points out another reporter.

<ROSANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If they were off duty, why were they in a patrol car? What exactly were they doing at the scene of a kidnapping?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSANNA>
<DIRECTION>
He stares back over at her, furious. Rosanna smiles.

<ROSANNA>

It opens and out slides Rayburn. He looks down the hallway. Press conference is still going down that way. Rayburn heads the other way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But as he tries to enter Creasy's room, he's met in the door by TWO THUG COPS, in uniform.

Rayburn swallows his anger, starts fishing for his wallet. Suddenly, the thugs snap to attention. Manzano is on the way down followed by ADJUTANT and TWO PLAINCLOTHES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ignoring the proffered salutes, Manzano finishes his pastry, licks his fingertips as he regards Rayburn.
</DIRECTION>
<MANZANO>

	I'm sure he isn't. Though he's certainly adept at killing.

Cages of mangy looking mutts. Pull back to reveal Creasy on his hospital bed, IVs and all.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rayburn sits nearby. He looks up as Creasy stirs, wakes again. Creasy's eyes flicker to his friend, ask the first question on his mind. Pinta...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rayburn looks away, can't face his friend. And suddenly, Creasy knows.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's dead. Isn't she?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>

Rayburn finally nods. And with that gesture, God takes everything away. It might as well be the Old Testament. And we are about to get Biblical.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy turns his head, looks up at the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<RAYBURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was a fuck up. Someone hijacked the drop. The kidnapper, his nephew got killed.

MUGSHOT

Manzano and the adjutant have pulled chairs up alongside the bed. The adjutant flips through one of the binders. Each page holds a single MUGSHOT. Each time Creasy shakes his head, the adjutant flips to the next photo.
</DIRECTION>
<MANZANO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MANZANO>

Creasy shakes his head.

Creasy shakes his head at the next shot.

	If two of the men in my division could shoot like that, I could get rid of the other thirty-six.

One of the dogs starts to bark. Another. Soon ten of them. The VET ASSISTANT enters, shouts at them to quiet. Manzano ignores it, motions the adjutant to flip pages.

	<DIALOGUE>
	What am I doing here?
	</DIALOGUE>

The adjutant reaches the last page. Creasy shakes his head.

Creasy nods. Rayburn gets Creasy's arm over his shoulder, eases him off the gurney till his feet hit the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy winces, but the two of them start to walk out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BACK SIDE - VETERINARIAN CLINIC - NIGHT

INT. SUV - ROLLING - NIGHT

Rayburn constantly checking the rear view. No pursuit in sight. He looks over at Creasy.
</DIRECTION>
<RAYBURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you feel?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYBURN>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy looks over at him, finally shrugs.

	Stomach's gone. But... okay.

Creasy's not really listening. He's been looking in the passenger side view mirror. Nothing back there. Creasy sits up. A bit of an effort.

EXT. VIA BUENOS AIRES - MEXICO CITY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scene of the crime. Typical Mexican 'roadside shrines' where the policemen fell. A pyre of flowers where Pinta was scooped up, Creasy's blood still staining the sidewalk alongside. A car pulls up...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rosanna Guerrero gets out with a REPORTER and PHOTOGRAPHER. She directs them in Spanish. The reporter starts making notes; the photographer snaps photos of the shrine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rosanna stands by the flower pyre. Something catches her eye. A balled-up piece of paper and a half-burned candle beside it. As she picks it up, she spots something else.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across the street, Creasy walks. An awkward hitch in his stride. Outside the apartment of the piano teacher, surveying the scene with experienced eyes. Unaware of Rosanna
</DIRECTION>

</CREASY>
<ROSANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're interested in the same thing. I'm writing a story.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSANNA>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy walks away from her. Rosanna catches up and holds out a plastic ziploc.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This might interest you. I found it across the street.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSANNA>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy empties the contents of the ziplock into his hand. A small ball of paper and the remains of a black candle. Creasy unballs the paper. It's a photo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASH: Creasy at the police station. His photo taken.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's Santa Muerte. Death worship. The religion of La Hermanidad. There's a curse on you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSANNA>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a little late.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>

He hands it back to her, not interested. As he turns to go.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you going to do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSANNA>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy doesn't answer.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can help. I have a situation Mr. Creasy. There is a brotherhood called Le Hermanidad which protects both high ranking Government officials, corrupt police, and organized crime at a level that is very difficult for me to touch. I believe you were a victim of this organization. You and this story may help to unmask them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSANNA>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy looks carefully at Rosanna. Right now he trusts no one.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.

</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
He walks away towards Rayburn.

EXT. RAMOS HOUSE - DAWN

The SUV parked a discreet distance away. Rayburn grinds out another cigarette, mutters to himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CREASY'S ROOM - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bruno lets him in. Nothings been touched. Creasy retrieves his bullet from his shrine along with the 'Jack', Marlboros, and New Testament. Puts his few possessions in a bag. MOVE WITH him as he silently crosses out into the hall, heads toward...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PINTA'S ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stands there a moment. His pain entirely his own. And then he goes to Pinta's little desk, finds her school notebook buried in a pile. He flips through it until he finds...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The LICENSE PLATE NUMBER Pinta jotted for him. Then he notices the notebook is really a diary. Every page references her day to day relationship with Creasy. "I love you Creasy Bear." He hears soft footsteps. Creasy turns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lisa stands in the doorway in her nightgown, her eyes drilling through Creasy.
</DIRECTION>
<LISA>
<DIRECTION>
(softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You let them take her. She loved you and you let them take her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy just blinks at her as the words blast through him.
</DIRECTION>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are you here? Why didn't you die?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<CREASY>

<DIRECTION>
(shrugs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was already dead.

</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
Eyes brimming, Lisa has no more words. But Creasy comes bearing cold comfort.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want you to know something.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to kill them. Anyone who opens their eyes at me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
Lisa doesn't answer, but the connection between them is suddenly monumental. Finally, Creasy looks away. He picks up Pinta's battered, old TEDDY BEAR.
</DIRECTION>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Creasy...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<DIRECTION>
He turns, but she doesn't look back at him.
</DIRECTION>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kill them, Creasy.

Creasy nods. He will. As he continues away...

<DIRECTION>
EXT. GARDEN / POOL - RAMOS HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy exits the house and stands by the pool. Frank appears tail wagging and attempts to comfort Creasy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leaves blow across the surface of the water. Underwater slow motion, a wall turn. It looks remarkably like Pinta.

Someone's getting in on the passenger side.

Still in the driver's seat, Jorge wakes. The first thing he sees is that his hands are taped to the steering wheel with his pudgy white fingers exposed. He is naked, reminiscent of the 18 year old in the opening sequence.

The big man howls, his left ear suddenly missing, starts an epic struggle, practically breaking the wheel off the steering column. He is like a bucking Rhinoceros.

He howls as Creasy sprays his face with pepper spray.

A beehive. Cops. Photos of dead kidnappers on the wall: Jorge and Sandri. Sandri emasculated, one hand missing. Jorge behind the wheel, fingers stubs and a missing ear.
</DIRECTION>
<ADJUTANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two in one day. And they died very badly. Sandri and Jorge were prime suspects in twelve kidnappings in the last six months.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADJUTANT>
<DIRECTION>
Manzano studies the photo of Jorge.
</DIRECTION>
<MANZANO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoever did this was methodical, unafraid. Was Jorge's mugshot in the photos we showed Creasy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MANZANO>
<ADJUTANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I checked. But right after Sandri was shot, a girlfriend of his was found naked, hysterical in the street. She said it was a man fitting Creasy's description who shot him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADJUTANT>
<MANZANO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Creasy was, and maybe is again, a very lethal human being.

Seen through a two-way mirror. Manzano watches as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rayburn sits at a steel chair, bolted to the floor. Rayburn's eyes are closed. In meditation. Then, slowly, his arms extend out to the sides. Manzano is curious as, slower still, Rayburn extends both hands out in front of him, palms up. Must be a Zen thing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, both MIDDLE FINGERS are extended. With eyes still closed, Rayburn mouths 'fuck you'. Manzano bursts a laugh.

	None of your business. Or mine for that matter. I got nothing more to say.

<MANZANO>

	This is my jurisdiction. I want these men as much as Creasy does.

	He'll deliver more justice in a weekend, than ten years of your courts and tribunals. So stay out of his way.

</RAYBURN>
<MANZANO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I plan to. I'll even help him if I can. He's going to lead me to the 'The Dreamer'. Someone I want very badly. But I'd like to understand him. Give me that.

	What was she to Creasy then?

	Light. At the end of a long, dark tunnel. Somehow, she showed him it was alright to live again.

The words sink in. Manzano understands their magnitude.

Framed commendations fall to the carpet as Rosanna slams up against the wall of Manzano's office. Skirt up around her waist, Manzano moves inside of her. Between breaths:

	Is it true? Creasy saved the little girl that was kidnapped yesterday.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MANZANO>
<ROSANNA>

As Manzano considers this, likes it, Rosanna takes the ATM card out from her bra.

Underwater as Pinta swims. As she spins, kicks off the wall, it's Creasy who comes out the other side. A plume of red blossoming off his side.

The old man watches as Creasy opens he canvas bag, pulls out two metal tubes that he screws together. It's a ROCKET LAUNCHER. Next he pulls out a cone-shaped missile. The old man is starting to look curious.

A figure rises, framed in the window.

A 'Man On Fire' strides through the smoke and dust. A shotgun at his side and a Molotov cocktail in his left hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Without missing a stride he unloads both barrels into the drivers window. A scary prospect even though it's bullet- proof. The lit Molotov explodes beneath the car. Silence. Then a dull impact explosion. 30 feet of flames envelope the car. The driver and Tazinari both prisoners inside their own car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The driver exits releasing a full clip from his Uzi. Creasy nails him with a single shot to the head.

Tazinari exits through the flames hands high in the air.

There sits the canary yellow Coupe deVille. Eyes and mouth taped shut, hands and ankles bound by flex-cuffs. Tazinari stands there.

Creasy steps up, pulls the tape off Tazinari's eyes. He looks about, relatively calm considering.

Creasy pulls the buck knife from his pocket, flips it open. As Tazinari reacts, Creasy spins him round, slits his clothes up from ankle to neck. The cloth drops away, some hanging at Tazinari's wrists. Tazinari has a sudden loss of attitude.

Creasy rips down his Calvins. CU of Tazinari's face winces with either pain or extreme discomfort.

EXT. FREEWAY EMERGENCY OFF RAMP - DAY

Average speed 80 m.p.h. This is Mexico. Creasy slips the clutch, jumps out, and the Coup deVille kangaroos forward down the ramp. Gathering momentum into the oncoming traffic. Tazinari screams right on impact.

CLOSE UP of Jordan face down. We glimpse what we don't want to see. Black holes where his eyes and mouth were. His ears missing.

Creasy not terribly impressed. Just pissed that he's late.

Creasy doing laps. He swims the last few meters underwater. As he surfaces, Pinta waits by the edge. She nods in grim satisfaction.

He isn't doing well. The cloud of deep red emanating from his stomach envelopes his whole body.

INT. DINING ROOM - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Samuel eats dinner silently. Lisa just stares into space, nursing a vodka. Even great marriages cannot survive the trauma of kidnapping and subsequent death.

</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to tell you a story. Your lawyer is dead. Someone didn't want him talking. Last week he wired $2.5 million into his U.S. bank account. Colonel Ernesto Tazinari is also dead. He hijacked the ransom drop, another $2.5 million. If my arithmetic is correct it means $5 million remains.

</CREASY>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Planned what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	An autosequestra. Kalfus arranged for Pinta to be taken to a safehouse. I'm sure he thought she'd sit there for three days eating pizza and watching TV. It didn't work out that way. Everything got fucked up when I killed the cops and Tazinari saw an opportunity.
	</DIALOGUE>

Lisa screams. Creasy gestures with a finger to his lips.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>

Through all of the above, Creasy removes the special bullet held in the seam of his wallet. The misfire. He empties the other cartridges from his gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lisa suddenly attacks Samuel in a violent, emotional outburst of tears, screaming, and rage. Drawing blood from his nose and upper lip. Samuel smothers Lisa's arms beneath his. He appears strong and decisive for the first time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy very carefully takes the bullet, puts it into the magazine and chambers the round. He looks into Samuel's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A bullet does not lie. A bullet tells the truth. And the truth will set you free.

<DIRECTION>
Creasy looks up from the notebook and out at the city. And a smile comes. But it's bitter and hopeless.

It's half grief, half not knowing where to go next, what to do. And he's dying. He knows that too. Creasy dials a number on a cell phone.

INT. CLOSED RESTAURANT - NIGHT

The OWNER watches nervously as Creasy approaches wearing a wool CAP. A pale attempt at disguising his identity. There's a newspaper folded on his dais, more photos of Creasy, his dead targets, the story of his vendetta.

Empty restaurant, chairs on tables. An exterior streetlight illuminates the darkness. The owner leads him down a row of empty booths. Creasy slows, stops as he sees the only person waiting for him is Manzano. As Manzano smiles.

Creasy doesn't respond. Finally Manzano gives him the paper, a mimeographed mugshot, and address scrawled on it. Creasy stands. As he scoops up the pills. Creasy starts out.

CREASY sits up as a car pulls up, and a MAN gets out. Creasy checks the digital "8x10" even though this face is indelibly imprinted on his brain.

It's not "The Dreamer." Not as handsome, but there's a resemblance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MAN unlocks the front door, checks the street first and then enters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy regroups mentally and physically. Checks the magazine in his SIG SAUER. Chambers rounds into his shotgun. Looks up and sees a six-year-old on a bicycle approach the front door. A ten-year-old opens the door from inside. The six-year-old struggles to get his bicycle through the doorway.
</DIRECTION>

Creasy moves. He holds the shotgun against his leg as he strides across the street. "Man on Fire."

Creasy faces Reina, heavily pregnant. Silence. Two other kids hide behind her. Suddenly the wall next to Creasy explodes in a hail of bullets.

We realize Creasy caught one round in the chest. He's down on one knee... uses the shotgun as a crutch. Reina is screaming.

CREASY

<DIRECTION>
Behind the wheel of the Volkswagon, roars out chasing.

Now through the maze of poverty... Creasy drives hard... no sign of the Man... empty eyes of poverty looking back... mostly women and children... They clearly see Creasy... fully exposed... driving a car with no windshield... He slams the car into reverse.

Someone says "Creasy" aloud... now more faces to turn... children looking directly through his absent windshield.

	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DANIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Creasy. What do you want?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANIEL>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
Several beats of silence. We can hear Daniel's breathing.
</DIRECTION>
<DANIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How much do you want?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANIEL>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's non-negotiable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DANIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two million U.S.... Three million U.S.?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANIEL>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you, non-negotiable.

Daniel hangs up.

LIVING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cell phone ringing.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
Daniel has a different attitude, a lot more amenable. He tries to speak to Creasy very logically about a very illogical subject.
</DIRECTION>
<DANIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The most important thing in life is family. And there you are. You have my family. What do you want?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANIEL>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DANIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is not possible. But in that house I have money. If I tell you where --
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANIEL>
<CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
(interrupts)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your brother wants to talk to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
Holding the shotgun with his right hand, Creasy holds the phone to Aurillio's ear.
</DIRECTION>
<AURILLIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Daniel?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AURILLIO>
<DIRECTION>
BOOM! Creasy shoots Aurillio in his right kneecap. As Aurillio HOWLS in agony...
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen to me. Listen! I'm going to take your family apart piece by piece.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
The line goes dead. Hang up. Creasy's ready to explode.
</DIRECTION>
<REINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Under the sink. We have money under the sink. Six million dollars. It's wet but good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REINA>
<DIRECTION>
The phone begins to ring again. Creasy answers.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(silence)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DANIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen! I will give you a life for a life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANIEL>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DANIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Her life for your life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy's confused.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whose life?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy's confused.
</DIRECTION>
<DANIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The girl's. Pinta's.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANIEL>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a liar. Pinta's dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DANIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a businessman. A dead girl is worth nothing. She is alive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANIEL>
<DIRECTION>
A long beat.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want proof of life. What did she call her bear?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
DANIEL hangs up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Aurillio moans on the floor. Reina says the rosary. The kids cry. The phone rings. Creasy listens, not capable of speaking.
</DIRECTION>
<DANIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Creasy. She calls the bear 'Creasy Bear.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Time stands still for Creasy. Words evaporate. Liquid film in Creasy's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP of Creasy's shocked face. He pulls down his shirt collar. Bubbles of blood form and reform over his chest wound as the maroon spreads across his chest and stomach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CREASY
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Where?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
AFI SURVEILLANCE VAN

Vans on the move. Team Leader, radios.

<TEAM_LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We received enough of a signal to at least put him in the Zona Colonia. Shit not enough time. He hung up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TEAM_LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VW BUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy driving. Great AC without the front windshield. Keeps him awake. Daniel Sanchez V.O. detailing the drop. Creasy trying desperately to drive and write down the address.
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lisa, don't hang up on me. Pinta is alive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
INTERCUT WITH:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LISA'S BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blinds are drawn. Slivers of light illuminate her emotionally drained face.
</DIRECTION>
<LISA>
<DIRECTION>
(silence)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't believe you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want you to get into your car now and meet me on the south end of the footbridge between Reforma and the freeway junction. In 45 minutes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're lying. I don't believe you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then don't come.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
He disconnects. He cannot waste his ebbing strength.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BRIDGE OF THE AZTECS - SUNSET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Darkness has fallen. Few people are on the street as Creasy pulls to the south end of the bridge. He parks... looks around... it's deserted. She's not coming. Checks his watch, turns and walks toward the bridge. The Ramos Mercedes drives up the bridge. Headlights off. Lisa is driving. She exits the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She runs to catch Creasy.
</DIRECTION>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Creasy... Wait.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay here. If you do something stupid, we won't get her back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
He climbs the steps of the bridge trying to maintain his dignity through the pain. He can see cars parked on the other side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OTHER SIDE OF THE BRIDGE - Creasy's POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy's dreamlike POV (Is it real or a dream) A driver exits a shadowed car and opens the passenger door. A SMALL FIGURE in a hooded sweat shirt and sweat pants exits the car. Confused. Disoriented.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CREST OF THE BRIDGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy waits. Breathing labored breaths. He sees it all.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OTHER SIDE OF THE BRIDGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The driver unties little hands. Removes a blindfold from under the hood. He steps away. Offering no help.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The small figure is confused.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CREST OF THE BRIDGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy calls out:
</DIRECTION>
<CREASY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pinta. Pinta.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREASY>
<DIRECTION>
She turns and looks. It looks remarkably like her even under the hooded sweatshirt. She begins to run. Across the street, up the steps toward Creasy. A screaming train flashes beneath. Car headlights illuminate the bridge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Time stands still and the 'city sounds' fade out to nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She runs up the remaining stairs and sprints across the bridge. Her hood blows off revealing her full face. It's definitely Pinta. Camera ramps as he jumps into Creasy's arms. This is not the little girl we experienced in the beginning of the movie. The experience she just endured has been life changing. All of a sudden we have a 40 year old head on an 8 year old body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She wraps herself around him. He picks her up. We glimpse a simple tear on his cheek. They talk. But we do not hear the words.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She notices her mom on the far side of the bridge. Creasy maneuvers her toward Lisa.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Before she goes to her mother we hear:
</DIRECTION>
<PINTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you, Creasy... And you love me, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINTA>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy nods. The inference is that he will see her in a few minutes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We start to hear Linda Ronstadt painfully, quietly on the wind singing "Blue Bayou." He continues to walk across to the opposite side of the bridge and gets into the kidnappers' car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a certain sort of calm of him. He closes the door, he lays his head against the back window. He looks out at PINTA at the other side of the bridge, where she's screams for Creasy. "Blue Bayou" gets LOUDER. Pinta now knows it was a lie. Creasy is not coming back. We're shooting through the glass of the back window. We se Mexico City reflected in the glass. As the car pulls out, time slows, and we see Creasy lay his head back and close his eyes as the car descends down into a dark tunnel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pinta can see Creasy's face, eyes slowly closing. He can hear her screams before being enveloped by the night. As "Blue Bayou" continues...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MEXICO CITY STREETS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dark spot in the road. Suddenly Police lights, on the roofs of four cars, flash simultaneously in front, in blocking position. The driver turns and looks back wanting to escape. He has a blacked out AFI armored van right on his rear bumper. Nowhere to go.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SWAT at his door. He's pulled and proned out onto the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Manzano enters the driver's seat. Reaching back to Creasy. Grabs his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<MANZANO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm your chauffeur now, Creasy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MANZANO>
<DIRECTION>
Manzano does a U-turn. Heading away. On his portable radio.
</DIRECTION>
<MANZANO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All units. Commence the operation. Repeat. Commence.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MANZANO>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches back again.
</DIRECTION>
<MANZANO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Creasy? Creasy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MANZANO>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP - Two hands clasp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Creasy's left with Manzano's right. A strong grip. Then no response. Manzano pulls to the curb.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Manzano reaches Creasy's wrist. Takes his pulse. Creasy's gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Manzano kneels. Still holding Creasy. Unfolds Creasy's fingers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP - Pinta's medallion of St. Jude clutched in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Manzano punches the seat again again and again.
</DIRECTION>
<MANZANO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goddamn you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MANZANO>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GUARDIAN'S CAR - HIGH ANGLE U-TURN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Manzano looks at Creasy and makes a decision.
</DIRECTION>
<MANZANO>
<DIRECTION>
(keys mic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold at the perimeter. Until I enter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MANZANO>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DANIEL'S COMPOUND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dark, suburban Cuernavaca street. Creasy's car rounds the corner. Security outside the compound motions to open the garage doors. The driver of the car is faceless. Street light reflections across the windshield.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car enters the gates. A collection of armed bodies appear in the courtyard curious to see this national hero. "Hombre en Fuego."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car stops. Nothing. This beat seems interminable. A hand opens the rear door: His forehead explodes. The driver door opens barely two shots, two more bodies drop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Panic and confusion. Everybody runs for cover. An overhead helicopter illuminates the mayhem in the courtyard. An armored vehicle rams through the gates.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Manzano explodes out of the driver's door in slow motion. He is clearly on a mission. He strides through the mayhem, Creasy's Sig Sauer in one hand, and a .45 auto in the other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Manzano's guide to his destination is the 'The Dreamer's' little Jack Russell running back to his master on instinct.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Manzano moves purposefully. His surrounding environment is Chaplinesque in its chaos. He enters a long walkway to a patio, following the dog. Daniel Sanchez appears at the end of the hall. We ramp him into slow motion. The Mexican version of Gotti. He raises his arms, prepared for the inevitable. The outcome is a given.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Manzano unloads a magazine into him and we -
