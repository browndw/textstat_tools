EXT. MOUNTAINS, NEAR GENEVA, SWITZERLAND - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The snow covered Alps stand out clearly in the light of a full moon. A fortress-like CHATEAU is situated in a flat saddle of forest partway up the mountain, next to a frozen lake. The property is surrounded by high stone walls, and the stately grounds are bathed in floodlights and patrolled by armed guards with dogs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CHATEAU - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The driveway and motorcourt are filled with cars. A formal- dress party is in progress... a private reception for a middle- eastern dignitary. Tuxedoes men escort their diamond-encrusted ladies through the huge front doors, where they doff their overcoats and are politely scanned with hand-held metal detectors by white gloved security staffers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The walled perimeter of the house runs along the lake, forming a kind of rampart. There is an opening, to a kind of waterway or canal, which connects to the private docks inside the grounds. There is a steel grating across the opening. The bars disappear down into the thin ice of early winter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With the house visible BG, we CRANE DOWN below the parapet wall along which a guard is a white exposure-suit is walking... down along the dark wall to the grating... TILTING DOWN to see a glow pulsing under the ice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BENEATH THE ICE, UNDERWATER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Camera moving toward: A FIGURE in diving gear working at the metal bars with an oxygen arc cutting torch. One bar has already been cut out. Two quick cuts and a second bar falls to the muddy bottom. Lit now only from the floodlights filtering down through the ice, the figure slips through the bars and swims powerfully along the stone canal wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seem from below, the figure is a black shadow moving against the rippled-glass of the ice above.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CANAL AND BOATHOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A dock extends into the frozen canal, just behind a large boathouse. There is a faint chipping sound. The ice breaks quietly, and the pieces are slid back. A head appears, in a rubber drysuit hood. The DIVER slips the regulator out of his mouth and turns slowly, scanning... revealing:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HARRY TASKER. Our hero. Harry floats with just his eyes above the surface, silent as a water snake, as a guard passes on a footpath nearby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a few beats Harry slips out of his tanks and fins, letting them sink, and climbs the frozen ladder onto the dock. He moves like a ninja into the shadows of the boathouse. Opening a WATERPROOF BAG, he pulls out a walky talky.
</DIRECTION>

INT./EXT. SURVEILLANCE VAN, MOUNTAIN ROAD - NIGHT

</GIB>
<DIRECTION>
Outside, FAST FAISIL, an Iranian-American, finishes making yellow snow and hurries back to the van. They are parked on a winding mountain road a half-mile from the chateau, whose lights are visible through the trees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Faisil jumps in and goes to the eyepiece of a huge telephoto nightvision scope. The eerie green image lurches as he sweeps the grounds, locating the boathouse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BOATHOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Concealed in the shadows, Harry is shucking out of his drysuit. Underneath is he is wearing black tux pants, suspenders, cummerbund and a formal shirt. He puts a tiny plug, like a hearing aid, deep in his ear canal. A SUB-VOCAL TRANSCEIVER. Very advanced.

</GIB>
<DIRECTION>
Harry slips into his shoulder harness... holster on one side, containing his .45 auto Glock-22, and the transmitter pack for the ear-piece slung on the other. He slips on a formal jacket, concealing the rig. Then a final touch. A little aftershave from a tiny plastic vial.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry adjusts his bow-tie and strides confidently out of the shadows, crossing quickly to the main house. He looks ultrasharp in his black tux with the white silk cummerbund and his hair slicked back. He enters the main house through a back service entrance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry strides through the huge kitchen like he owns the place. The kitchen staff are scurrying around, too busy to really notice. He finger-tastes a dish as he passes.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MAIN HALL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Here the party is in full swing. Harry blends smoothly into the crowd of foreign dignitaries, businessman and minor mid- east nobility. They are a high-octane mixture of new oil money and old European money, and run the spectrum from stodgy bankers to playboy arms dealers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry strolls amiably among the glittering woman, the cigar smoking men, casually snagging a glass of champagne and a canape from the passing waiters. He nods to someone as if he knows them. Greets another is quite fluent Arabic. People in his wake look at each other like "Do you know him?" They shrug, go on with their conversation. Harry moves through the crowd. Scanning.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's Daddy Petrobucks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
HARRY'S POV - Through the crowd is sees JAMAL KHALED, the host of the party and owner of the chateau. He is fat and animated, greeting guests with a flourish. As Harry watches he warmly greets a beautiful WOMAN. They become absorbed in a conversation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The woman glances up and sees Harry checking her out. There is a frank moment of returned interest. Then the crowd shifts, cutting off their view of each other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STAIRCASE AND SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry makes his way up the grand staircase to the second floor. He slips through doors into the private area of the mansion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The doors open and Harry slips into the darkened library. He crosses quickly to a window and opens it onto a terrace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BALCONIES - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry goes onto the terrace, and in a display of acrobatic prowess, he pulls himself up onto the third floor balcony directly above. He lets himself into--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KHALED'S OFFICE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Khaled's office is ornately furnished. Beautiful antiques glint in the moonlight coming in the French-doors. Harry crosses to an immense desk and boots up the computer there. Bathed in the glow from the screen, he pulls a FLAT BOX, about the size of a paperback, from the back of his cummerbund. He connects it quickly to the modem port in the back of the computer.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Modem in place. Transmitting... now.

</DIRECTION>
<FAISIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Affirmatory. We are in.

</FAISIL>
<DIRECTION>
Fast Faisil is a computer ace. His fingers fly on the keyboard as he types rapid key commands. We see familiar "windows appear". The words are all in Arabic characters.
</DIRECTION>

	These are encrypted files, guys. This is going to take me a few minutes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAISIL>
<DIRECTION>
INT. 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON LIBRARY DOOR. It opens a crack and a dental mirror comes out, looking around like a U-boat periscope. Seeing the coast is clear Harry slips out. But just as he is closing the door, a GUARD rounds the corner ten feet away. Harry turns smoothly. He smiles sheepishly and moves toward the guard.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>

The guard points warily down the corridor. Harry nods and heads that way, back toward the party.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MAIN HALL/ STAIRCASE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry comes down the staircase amid the glitter of the party. He is sipping champagne and looking bored. He sees two security guys moving purposefully through the crowd toward the stairs, walkies in their hands. He turns away as they pass him and pretends to study a large fragment of bas-relief... a temple frieze depicting a war chariot drawn by four horses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He senses someone next to him and turns. It is the WOMAN. She is captivatingly beautiful, and her gaze is piercing.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. DOCK/ BOATHOUSE (NIGHTVISION POV) - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seen through the starlight scope, we see one of the guards shining his light on the hole in the ice and then on Harry's footprints leading to the boathouse. He calls to one of the other guards, who comes running over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MANSION - NIGHT

Harry, still with Juno, hears Gib in his ear:

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harry, we got a problem. Guards are swarming all over the dock.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIB>
<DIRECTION>
Harry glances up the stairs. Khaled's SECURITY CHIEF is gesturing to several of his men, and speaking quickly into a walky. Three SECURITY MEN come down the stairs, scanning the crowd. Harry turns smoothly away from them and takes Juno's arm.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you dance, Ms. Skinner?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
He steers her toward the dance floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VAN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gib, listening, rolls his eyes. He looks through the night- vision scope. Guards are running around outside the chateau. Harry's stirred up the hornet's nest. Faisil is still jamming at the keyboard.
</DIRECTION>
<FAISIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, files are unlocked. I'm in. I'm down, baby. I got my hand up her dress and I'm going for the gold. I'm--

<DIRECTION>
INT. MAIN HALL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry whirls Juno aggressively across the dancefloor. She responds deftly. They are well matched. She parries each of his smooth moves with a flourish. It is a contest of wills, and a surprised appraisal for each that the other is worthy. Juno is hot. He bends her back at the waist, then snaps her up. She twirls into the crook of his arm. Their faces are inches apart. Wow. The music ends and she gives him a wry grin.
</DIRECTION>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well. And I thought this was going to be just another bunch of boring bankers and oil billionaires.

EXT. CHATEAU/ FRONT ENTRANCE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry nods to the security men at the door as he strides confidently through. He goes down the steps to the broad terrace above the motor court. Behind Harry, a GUARD lowers his walky talky and starts after him.
</DIRECTION>
<GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	May I see your invitation, sir?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
Without turning, Harry slips a small flat box out of his breast pocket. A REMOTE DETONATOR.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's my invitation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
He pushes the button and--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABOOM! The second floor office windows blow out in a fiery explosion. Using the diversion, Harry leaps off the terrace before the guard can open fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. VAN - NIGHT

Gib sees the rising fireball a half-mile away. He starts the van.

	Aw, shit. Here we go--
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIB>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CHATEAU AND GROUNDS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry sprints across the snow-covered lawn, through the trees. Guards with automatic weapons run after him, firing. The snow explodes around him with bullet hits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO DOBERMANS pelt toward Harry, leaping at him in perfect unison. He waits... and knocks their heads together in mid- leap with a crack like a baseball bat. The dogs drop to the snow, wobbling around like they're drunk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Harry sprints on, ANOTHER DOBERMAN lunges out of the bushes ahead, leaping directly for his throat. Harry grabs the dog and shot-puts him up into a tree without breaking stride. Dog Fu. The dog yelps and scrambles to hold onto an icy branch, looking down in amazement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PERIMETER WALL/ MOUNTAIN SLOPE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry leaps down on the outside of the wall, hitting a snow bank and sliding downhill. He sprints down the gentle slope toward the highway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry looks back as TWO GUARDS ON SKIS come out of a guard station beside the main entrance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRACKING WITH THE SKI-GUARDS, searching through the trees with lights. They have lost Harry. They stop. A snowbank behind them EXPLODES as Harry leaps out. He disables them both with vicious street-fighter moves. Harry looks upslope as--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A service gate opens in the perimeter wall and TEAMS OF SECURITY MEN in white snow-suits pour out, some on skis, some on SNOWMOBILES. A HELICOPTER rises over the wall in a blast of swirling snow. Its xenon lights rake through the trees, casting lurid wheeling shadows on the snow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON Harry, snapping closed the ski boots he has stolen from one of the disabled guards. He pops the boots quickly into the bindings and takes off downhill with one of the guard's FN FAL rifles slung across his back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The helicopter swoops downhill, its searchlight blazing through the forest. Snowmobile headlights illuminate the ski-patrols zig-zagging among the trees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry slashes expertly downhill. He cuts a distinguished figure in his black tux. Automatic weapons fire rips through the trees from behind him. Harry is going flat-out. The xenon light hits him. A 7.62 mm machine gun in the chopper rips the slope into white clouds around him. Harry slashes, turns, weaving among the trees at breakneck speed. A snowmobile is closing in, outflanking him. He turns toward it, suddenly. Hits a mogul. Uses the air to slash his skis right across the rider's face. The snowmobile crashes and tumbles into the night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. VAN - MOUNTAIN ROAD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GIB'S VAN takes an icy turn in a hairy slide.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE Gib is peering upslope, trying to see what's going on. All he can see are lights and gunfire.
</DIRECTION>
<GIB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harry, what's your twenty? I need a position, buddy--
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIB>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly a skier in a black tux launches across the road from the slope above, RIGHT OVER THE VAN, and lands deftly downslope.
</DIRECTION>
<GIB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh... right! I'll catch you on the next bend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIB>
<DIRECTION>
Behind the van, pursuing guards leap across the road. Only about half can make the jump. The rest crash horribly. The helicopter thunders overhead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MOUNTAIN SLOPE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry sees the chopper start an attack run. He comes out into the open, going straight downhill like a rocket. The chopper gets suckered in... trying to hit him, getting right down behind him... and suddenly-- Harry slides to a stop in an explosion of powder and whips up the rifle. P-P-P-POW! He rakes a burst across the windshield. The startled pilot swerves and-- Suddenly two tall pine trees are right in front of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
K-WHACK! The main-rotor blade snaps clean off and the chopper drops into the snow, plowing into a snowbank. It slides right to the edge of a steep ridge and stops, teetering.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Firing from a snowmobile, one of the guards puts a burst right across Harry's path. Harry's skis are hit and he tumbles, comes out of it... running down the hill like a juggernaut in his heavy boots. He has lost the rifle somewhere in the snow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry takes cover behind the burning wreck of the downed chopper, which still has its engine running. The ski patrol opens fire from upslope. Rounds whacking against the disabled helicopter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry looks down the slope and gets an idea. He jerks the unconscious pilot out and pushes on the fuselage, rocking it. It slips over the edge. He leaps inside as it topples forward and slides down the slope.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT./ EXT. HELICOPTER - MOUNTAIN SLOPE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry adds throttle and works the footpedals, using the tail- rotor to steer. The chopper had snow-skids, and Harry is skiing the damn thing down the mountain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The copter is burning as it rockets down the slope on its skids. Bullets are hitting the fuselage, and everything around it. Skiers are wiping out, hitting trees. A snowmobile hits a rock and flies spectacularly into a ravine.

<DIRECTION>
Big is scanning above for the chopper. Then upslope he sees the burning fuselage skiing expertly among the trees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The chopper hits a jump and launches into the air-- It crashes through trees, still soaring and-- Gib looks up, screaming as-- The chopper drops right toward him-- He hits the brakes and-- BLAMMO! It drops onto the road ten feet in front of the skidding van... then slides over the edge and tumbles into a rocky canyon where is BLOWS UP! The fireball lights up the night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gib and Faisil jump out of the van. They look downslope at the burning wreckage.

<HARRY>

<DIRECTION>
Gib and Faisil spin to look behind them. Harry is lodged in tree-branches hanging over the road. Gib hands his MP-5K machine gun to Faisil and reaches up to Harry, who grabs his hand and pulls. Harry tumbles down into the snowbank. He stands, brushing snow off his tux, and clomps toward the van in his ski-boots. He is completely unruffled.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go. We can still make our flight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
As Faisil is getting into the van behind Harry, TWO GUARD TEAMS ON SNOWMOBILES roar around the bend behind them, fish-tailing on the ice. Faisil OPENS FIRE. One snowmobile swerves over the embankment. The other pulls up broadside, and the guards duck behind it. Gib floors it and the van roars down the mountain. Faisil is still Ramboing on full-auto.

Harry slips inside. He sets down his suitcase and walks quietly down the hall. He pauses at a door with lurid labels and stickers plastered all over it (Toxic Waste, STAY OUT!, IF IT'S TOO LOUD YOU'RE TOO OLD, etc.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry silently opens the door and looks in at his sleeping daughter, DANA. She looks like an angel in the moonlight coming in the window. In fact, she is a typical 14 year old girl, and therefore hardly an angel. But to Harry she is unflawed.

Harry, undressed now, slips into bed next to... a lump in the covers which we presume to be a human being. This is HELEN TASKER, Harry's wife of 15 years. He kisses her on the cheek and she stirs. She rolls toward him, giving him a sleepy hug and a kiss.

Harry hurries out and Dana considers the Swiss village a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really lame.

</DANA>
<DIRECTION>
She plonks is straight in the wastebasket.

INT. HALLWAY/BEDROOM/ BATHROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry strides down the hall, avoiding their small but incredibly ugly dog, GIZMO, who skitters past him going the other way.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dana, don't forget to feed Gizmo!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Harry crosses the bedroom, hurrying past Helen who is clearly rushing to get ready herself. We get our first good look at Helen. She is wearing a terrycloth robe as she picks out an outfit. Her hair is wrapped in a towel. To call her plain would be inaccurate. She could be attractive if she put any effort into it, which doesn't occur to her.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm late.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
They talk without looking at each other, the way people who have been together a long time do.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How'd it go at the trade show? You make all the other salesmen jealous?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. You should have seen it. We were the hit of the show with the new model ordering system, the one for the 680... how you can write up an order and the second the customer's name goes into the computer, it starts checking their credit, and if they've ordered anything in the past, and if they get a discount...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
She is already tuning him out. And it hits us: SHE HAS NO IDEA WHAT HARRY REALLY DOES.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
(barely listening)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's fabulous Harry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, it was wild.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Harry glances at her, oblivious to him and brushing her teeth. He smiles. The best lies are told with enthusiasm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FRONT HALLWAY, LIVING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gib opens the door, knocks a bit, then strolls in like he lives there. He is wearing dark Ray Bans, like he's doing a Roy Orbison impression. Gizmo runs toward him, yapping, but Gib gives him the evil eye.
</DIRECTION>
<GIB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come any closer I'll kill you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIB>
<DIRECTION>
The dog backs up, whining plaintively. Gib throws his jacket over the back of the couch and then, inexplicably, he takes out a pack of CAMELS and sets it on the mantelpiece. He adjusts its position carefully. Hmmmm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATHROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry and Helen maneuver around each other expertly. She is doing her make-up.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The plumber came yesterday. He said they have to dig under the slab or something and it's going to be six hundred dollars to fix.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
Harry is not really paying attention as he ties his tie in front of the mirror. His mind is elsewhere. He couldn't care less about there domestic problems.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh huh. Okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not okay. It's extortion.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did you tell him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I slept with him and he knocked off a hundred bucks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good thinking, honey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Harry kisses her on the cheek and exits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gib enters and pours two cups of coffee. Dana is drinking orange juice from the bottle at the fridge.
</DIRECTION>
<GIB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, kid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIB>
<DANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Gib. What up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANA>
<DIRECTION>
She EXITS, eating an uncooked pop-tart. Harry comes in a second later and Gib hands him his coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks dear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<GIB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here, check these out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIB>
<DIRECTION>
Gib hands Harry the glasses. Harry studies them, seeing the VIRTUAL VIDEO DISPLAY inside the left lens of the Ray Bans. Harry glances down the hall, making sure no-one is looking, then he puts them on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HARRY'S POV - INSIDE THE GLASSES - A black and white video image of his own living room.
</DIRECTION>
<GIB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The CCD camera and transmitter and inside a pack of smokes. Slick little unit, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIB>
<DIRECTION>
IN POV we see Dana enter the living room. She looks around carefuly, then quickly lifts Gib's jacket and slips out his wallet. She palms two twenties in the blink of an eye and puts the wallet back. Pro moves.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Son of a bitch!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<GIB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?

Harry whips off the glasses and charges out of the kitchen. Gib goes after him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dana comes out the front door, letting it slam behind her, and runs to her boyfriend, TRENT, who is waiting for her in the driveway on his idling YAMAHA. Trent is 16, dressed in grunge- rock style, trying to look tough. Harry comes out the front door as Trent revs the motor.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dana!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
She waves from the back of the bike as Trent pops the clutch and they shoot down the driveway.

INT./EXT. GIB'S CAR/ STREETS OF WASHINGTON - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are driving through D.C. Harry is still shocked by his daughter's behavior.
</DIRECTION>
<GIB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kids. Ten seconds of joy. Thirty years of misery.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIB>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She knows not to steal. I've taught her better than that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<GIB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but you're not her parents, anymore, you and Helen. Her parents are Axl Rose and Madonna. The five minutes you spend a day with her can't compete with that kind of constant bombardment. You're outgunned, amigo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIB>
<DIRECTION>
Gib and Harry turn onto Pennsylvania Avenue, heading toward Lafayette Square. Capital Hill is behind them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TEKTEL OFFICES - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry and Gib come out of an elevator on the 12th floor. Behind the receptionist is a burnished metal sign which reads TEKTEL SYSTEMS. They cross a open floor of cubicle spaces. There is the hum of activity everywhere. A normal day at a normal business.
</DIRECTION>
<SECRETARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Morning, Mr. Tasker.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECRETARY>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Morning, Charlene.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<GIB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See, kids now are ten years ahead of where we were at the same age. You probably think she's still a virgin--
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIB>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be ridiculous. She's only -- how old is she?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<GIB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fourteen, Harry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIB>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. She's only fourteen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
They go into a corridor.
</DIRECTION>
<GIB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh huh. And her little hormones are going like a fire alarm. I say even money that physicist on the bike is boinkin' her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIB>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No way. Not Dana.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
They stop at a door, like any other along the corridor. It is blank.
</DIRECTION>
<GIB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Okay. De-nail ain't just a river in Egypt. She's probably stealing the money to pay for an abortion.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIB>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you just open the door!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Gib touches a plastic card to an unmarked spot just above the doorknob. There is the CLUNK of a SOLENOID LOCK.
</DIRECTION>
<GIB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or drugs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIB>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They enter a long corridor, which is featureless except for video surveillance cameras. They walk along the silence for a moment, then . . .
</DIRECTION>
<GIB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twenty here, fifty there... I figured my wife's boyfriend was taking it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIB>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you moved out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<GIB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well . . . I moved back in. My lawyer said it would give me a better claim on the house in the property settlement. Don't change the subject... you owe me two hundred bucks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIB>
<DIRECTION>
They approach another door, with a (bulletproof) glass window in it. Beyond is a brightly lit room, with a woman sitting at a desk... and nothing else. Gib presses a buzzer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OUTER SECURITY ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JANICE sits at the non-descript desk like a receptionist... but she is a highly trained security specialist. She is also hefty through the shoulders, aggressively unattractive and utterly humorless. She watches them on a monitor screen as they stand outside the door. Harry and Gib appear as living X-Ray images. Their weapons are visible in their shoulder harnesses. Janice puts one hand automatically on the butt of a .45 tucked in a holster riveted beneath her desk. She buzzes Harry and Gib in with the other.
</DIRECTION>
<JANICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gentlemen, please idenitify yourselves to the scanner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANICE>
<DIRECTION>
Harry and Gib step up to the combination retinal-thumbprint- voice scanners. Harry presses his thumb against a black-glass plate for laser scan, and looks into the eye-piece of the retinal scanner.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harry Tasker. One zero zero two four.

Their clearance appears on a monitor on Janice's desk.
</DIRECTION>
<JANICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you. You are cleared.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANICE>
<DIRECTION>
She stands to give them plastic I.D. badges which they hang around their necks.
</DIRECTION>
<GIB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Janice, how many years have you been buzzing us in?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIB>
<JANICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ten, Mr. Gibson.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANICE>
<GIB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you still reach for your piece every time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIB>
<JANICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANICE>
<GIB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God! You have no idea how much that turns me on. I've never had the courage to say this before but... I love you, Janice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIB>
<JANICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANICE>
<DIRECTION>
He kisses her wetly on the cheek as he goes by. She does not react is any discernible way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They pass through a heavy stainless steel door which opens automatically. Beyond is a kind of airlock... a SALLY PORT. Behind a lexan shield are TWO GUARDS armed with MP5s. They nod but do not speak at Harry and Gib pass them.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You better watch it. She might file on you for sexual harassment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<GIB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In her dreams.

INT. OMEGA SECTOR INNER SANCTUM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gib and Harry pass through the inner door of the sally port into a large austere atrium.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE FROM ABOVE as they cross. A huge graphic logo covers the floor. Across the center is says OMEGA SECTOR. In smaller print, around the perimeter, is the motto: "THE LAST LINE OF DEFENSE".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They enter a high-tech office space. It is a maze of glass partitions surrounding a central floor-space of cubicles. There is a hushed quality here. People do not joke. They do not hurry. There are a lot of computer screens displaying information from around the world. It looks like a combination of NASA mission control and FBI headquarters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fast Faisil greets them, yawning, as they pass his partitioned cubicle.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Fize. We're late for our butt-grinding.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Faisil gulps his coffee and hurries after them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A dark and severe conference room, with large-screen computer displays at one end. Glowering at one end of the long, polished table, is SPENCER TRILBY, the chief of Omega Sector. Visualize a cross between Colin Powel and J. Edgar Hoover.
</DIRECTION>
<TRILBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, Harry! You guys really screwed the pooch last night. Please tell me how I can look at this, that it's not a total pooch- screw.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRILBY>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Total is a strong word--
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<GIB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are degrees of totality.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIB>
<FAISIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a scale really, with "perfect mission" on one end and "total pooch-screw" on the other and we're more about here--
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAISIL>
<TRILBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Faisil. You're new on Harry's team, aren't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRILBY>
<FAISIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAISIL>
<TRILBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what makes you think that the slack I cut him in any way translates to you?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRILBY>
<FAISIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, sir. Uh... here's what we got.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAISIL>
<DIRECTION>
He hits a button and a photo of Khaled fills a wall-screen.
</DIRECTION>
<FAISIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jamal Khaled. We think he's dirty so we raid his financial files... Check it out...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAISIL>
<DIRECTION>
Faisil hits some buttons and a second screen lights up with the data for their raid.
</DIRECTION>
<FAISIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One hundred million in wire transfers from the COMMERCE BANK INTERNATIONAL--
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAISIL>
<GIB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which we all know is a front for certain nations to fund terrorist activities. Something big is going down --
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIB>
<FAISIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And we know that a week ago four MIRV warheads were smuggled out of the former Soviet Republic of Kazakhstan . . .
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAISIL>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We think Khaled's group has bought the nukes and is bringing them to U.S. soil.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<TRILBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So far this is not blowing my skirt up, gentleman. Do you have anything remotely substantial? Don't be pumping beets up my ass here. Do you have hard data?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRILBY>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not what you'd call rock hard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<GIB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's pretty limp, actually.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIB>
<TRILBY>

INT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is the interior of a huge law office. Helen works there as a paralegal. She is going to the break room for coffee with her friend, ALLISON, a secretary. Allison is black, younger then Helen, and still single.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, it's not like he's saving the world or anything. He's a sales rep for Chrissakes. Whenever I can't get to sleep I ask him to tell me about his day. Six seconds and I'm out. But he acts like he's curing cancer or something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<ALLISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So I guess you didn't get away for the weekend after all?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLISON>
<HELEN>

	You bitch.

</HELEN>
<ALLISON>

	Girlfriend, you got a man. You just have to take control . . . set up the right mood.

</ALLISON>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harry only has two moods: busy... and asleep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<ALLISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then you better do something to jumpstart that man's motor. You know... wake up the sleeping giant of his passion.

<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It doesn't mean anything. She buys antiquities for Khaled.

</HARRY>
<GIB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nope. The art buys are in a separate ledger.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIB>
<FAISIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And this is a little above market- rate for the horizontal bop, even for a total biscuit like her.

	Alright, I want a complete workup on her. Do we know where she is?

INT. TASKER HOUSE/ KITCHEN - NIGHT (10PM)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DING! Harry opens the microwave as his dinner finishes re- heating. He sits down alone at the kitchen table and pulls the Saran-wrap off the plate. Another solo supper two hours late. His motions are so automatic we gather that this is the rule, not the exception. Helen comes in from the living room, holding the suspense novel she is reading.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need you to talk to Dana. The vice principle called and she cut class again this afternoon.

EXT. DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
A basketball hoop is bolted to the garage and Dana is shooting baskets in the driveway. Moths orbit the outside floodlights. She sinks one, dribbled back to the foul line. Harry comes up behind her and lifts the ball out of her hands as she stands poised to shoot. She turns.
</DIRECTION>

Harry is extending his business card to the receptionist as Juno breezes into the lobby from a corridor. She is dressed sharply and looks as stunning as Harry remembers.
</DIRECTION>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harry! I thought I might see you again. I just didn't except you to call so soon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNO>
<DIRECTION>
Juno lingers a second or so long on the handshake.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, what's the point of waiting?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I agree.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNO>
<DIRECTION>
There is definitely unholy magnetism here. She indicates for Harry to walk with her and leads him through the suite of offices. There are mounted fragments of ancient sculpture in niches on either side, and beautifully restored mosaics and tablets of hieroglyphics mounted on the walls.
</DIRECTION>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So your clients want something for the lobby of their new corporate headquarters?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNO>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right. They want something... dramatic. I spoke to a number of people who said you're the one to see.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Juno leads Harry through a door into a large warehouse area. There is a bustle of activity as workmen unpack crates. An overhead crane is used to move huge stone pieces. There are massive columns, and statues two stories high. Even the entire facade of a tomb.
</DIRECTION>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what did these... people... say about me exactly?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNO>
<DIRECTION>
They stroll amongst the statues, as coveralled workmen move around them with tools, scaffolding, pneumatic equipment. Most of the workers are middle-eastern.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's see... that you can read ancient Sanskrit without having to sound out the words. And that other dealers and archeologists don't like you much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those wimps. It's because I use my diplomatic contacts to export cultural treasures from countries which tell them to take a hike.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(yelling in Arabic to two workmen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you to move those crates an hour ago. Come on guys, let's get going.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNO>
<DIRECTION>
We realize that A WORKMAN is watching them intently from nearby. He is an intense looking MIDDLE-EASTERN MAN in his mid- thirties.
</DIRECTION>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see, a lot of these pieces are from ancient Persia. Unfortunately, ancient Persia is twenty feet under the sand of Iran, Iraq and Syria. Not the most popular places lately. So I've had to become an expert in international diplomacy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNO>
<DIRECTION>
Juno stops and looks at Harry. Her smile indicates the possibility of more than just business.
</DIRECTION>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, do you see anything you like, Mr. Renquist?

INT. HOTEL SUITE - DAY

Harry, Gib and Fast Faisil are in a luxury suite at the MARQUIS HOTEL. It is a corner suite, with a spectacular view of the city. Faisil is routinely sweeping the room for bugs with an electronic DETECTOR.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's importing stuff from all over the mid-east.

	She could be moving money, guns. Anything.

INT. JUNO'S WAREHOUSE - DAY

<DIRECTION>
WE FOLLOW the WORKMAN we saw watching Harry earlier. He catches up with Juno, who is going through the doors to the office area. His name is MALIK.
</DIRECTION>
<MALIK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ms. Skinner? Can I speak to you for a moment please, in your office?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALIK>
<DIRECTION>
His manner is self-effacing. Humble. He doesn't meet her gaze. She nods and they go into the private office.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JUNO'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MALIK comes in behind her and closes the door. The moment they are away from public observation, his manner changes. His humble posture straightens and his eyes flash intensely as he approaches her. Without warning he SLAPS HER HARD ACROSS THE FACE.
</DIRECTION>
<MALIK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You stupid undisciplined bitch!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALIK>
<DIRECTION>
Her jaw clenches but her reaction is surprisingly submissive.

	It's a good thing you pay me well.

	No. He checked out okay--

</JUNO>

Malik slaps her again.
</DIRECTION>
<MALIK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That is for interrupting.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(He backhands her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that is for being wrong. We do not tolerate mistakes.

Juno bites her lip.

INT. JUNO'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A WORKMAN guides Harry through the maze of statuary. He points toward the back of the warehouse and then leaves. Harry is left alone in the vast space.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Only a few lights are on, rendering the place somewhat Gothic. Harry strolls in the direction the workman pointed. Ahead of him, is the huge facade of a royal tomb. There is a flickering light inside. A shadow moves across the wall in the entryway.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
He enters the stone doorway of the tomb. FOLLOWING HARRY as he steps into the inner chamber. There is an oil-lamp burning on a stone sarcophagus, the only light. The room appears empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE ON HARRY. Behind him a figure emerges from a shadowed alcove. It is Juno. She looks ethereal in the strange light.
</DIRECTION>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Harry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNO>
<DIRECTION>
Harry whips around, startled.
</DIRECTION>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you like my tomb? The museum financing fell out, so I thought your clients might be interested.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNO>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's certainly... dramatic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Especially in this light. This is the only light they had then, so I like to study it this way. I love this place. I love all ruins.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNO>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that why you got into this business?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Juno turns to him in the flickering half-light. She moves closer. Her eyes seem to glitter.
</DIRECTION>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've always been a collector at heart. When I see something I want, I have to have it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNO>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you have a reputation as someone who gets what she wants.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
She is very close to him. Her eyes seem to glitter in the light from the oil lamp. She is unbelievably beautiful.

	Yes, I do.

INT. TOMB - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Juno picks up the lamp and walks along the wall, holding it up so that the flickering shadows seem to bring the bas-relief figures to life. Stone faces shift and change, stone eyes move.
</DIRECTION>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at this. People who dies twenty centuries ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNO>
<DIRECTION>
Juno presses her cheek against the cold stone. She runs her fingers slowly across the figures. It is strange and erotic.
</DIRECTION>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They breathed and loved and wept, just like us. And now their ideals, their religions, their social orders... are gone like mist. What did any of it matter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNO>
<DIRECTION>
She crosses to Harry.
</DIRECTION>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I only hope they lived well. That they got what they wanted.

She puts her hands on him and pulls herself close. It is a hypnotic moment.

Juno is moving in for a more passionate lip-lock when-- BEEP BEEP BEEP!! Harry pulls his beeper off his hip and looks at it. The moment is spoiled.

There are three men in the car. YUSIF and MAHMOUD are in the front, with Mahmoud driving. In the back, shadowed, we can just make out ABU MALIK. Yusif is massively built, with a body like a beer-keg. Mahmoud is skinny and intense.

EXT. MALL - NIGHT

	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't smoke, dickhead.

Harry lets his hand drop to his side, holding the pack of cigarettes casually. He turns his hand. The tiny lens in the cigarette pack glints.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV VIDEO SCREEN --inside the left lens of the glasses. The camera in the cigarette pack reveals Yusif and Mahmoud getting out of their cars, crossing the street half a block away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HARRY strolls into the mall. It is an open promenade design, with a moderate crowd of shoppers and movie-goers. Harry watches in the glasses as Mahmoud and Yusif slip through the crowd behind him.

EXT. MALL - NIGHT

Harry turns off the main concourse, into a narrower walkway between shops. In the video-glasses he watches Yusif and Mahmoud, who have split up to look less conspicuous, as they track him through the pedestrian traffic.

	That's not true, honey--
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is true! He doesn't know anything about me. He still thinks I'm like ten years old or something. As long as I just smile and say yes to whatever he says, like his good little fantasy daughter, he thinks everything's fine. But it's not fine. Nothing's fine.

<DIRECTION>
INT. RESTROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry can't answer because Mahmoud just entered the room behind him. Harry is at one of the urinals, apparently taking a leak. Mahmoud goes to the mirror. Starts combing his hair. He doesn't much notice the pack of Camels sitting on the counter nearby. Harry is whistling. Shaking himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HARRY'S POV - In the video glasses Harry sees himself and Mahmoud. Yusif comes into the restroom, seemingly ignoring both Harry and Mahmoud, as if heading for the stalls. As he passes behind Harry he reaches into his coat--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry spins lightning fast. He knocks away the SILENCED PISTOL aimed at the back of his head with a sweeping block, capturing Yusif's arm in an arm-lock. The shot goes wide, shattering a urinal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry slams his palm into Yusif's face like a piledriver, and spins him against the steel stalls. The silenced pistol goes skittering across the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mahmoud whips a pistol out of his waistband. Still holding the bear-like Yusif, Harry draws his Glock so fast we can barely see him move. BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! Three .45 slugs go through Mahmoud's chest, shattering the mirror behind him. He flops on his butt, slumping against the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yusif, who is easily Harry's size, bellows and grabs his gun arm. They smash against the walls, struggling for the gun. Yusif, locked to Harry, hurls him against the stalls. They hit a locked door, which pops open, banging inward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yusif drives Harry to the floor. Harry's head is between the shoes of an OLD GUY sitting on the can, who looks down uncomprehendingly at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yusif slams Harry's gun hand repeatedly against the doorframe of the stall. He twists Harry's wrist brutally. He even pounds against Harry's hand with his knee. The old guy winces. That's got to hurt. Harry cries out in pain and the gun drops. Yusif reaches for it, but Harry kicks it under the stalls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He punches Yusif in the face, driving him back. They grapple, spinning. Harry drives Yusif's head into the counter. Then he elbows him in the throat and they crash together on the filthy floor. Harry grabs Yusif's hair and pounds his face repeatedly against the rim of a urinal. In case you haven't noticed, this is a messy, nasty fight. Survival is like that.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yusif sags into submission. Harry pulls a nylon zip-strip out of his pocket and uses it like hand-cuffs, securing Yusif's wrists.
</DIRECTION>

Gib is running full out, drawing his gun. He has one finger jammed in his ear. His gut is doing the rumba as he runs.

INT. RESTROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry is pulling Yusif to his feet when the door bangs open behind him. He turns, thinking it is Gib. It's not. Malik raises a FULL-AUTO BERETTA 92-F and opens fire. Harry spins Yusif between him and the machine pistol. Yusif's beer-keg body stops the spray of 9mm slugs form hitting Harry long enough for him to dive into a stall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malik hoses the room with the Beretta. The metal stalls are riddled with hits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HARRY is in the stall with the old guy, who's just sitting there. The walls of the stall are pimpling with the hits on the far side. Harry reaches under the stall, retrieving his Glock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MALIK goes empty. Harry hears that and pops out, cranking off rounds--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malik is a blur going out the door, as Harry's shots shatter tiles on the doorframe. Then silence.
</DIRECTION>

Malik spins to see Gib nearby, going into a firing stance behind a light-standard. The terrorist doesn't hesitate. His Beretta ROARS at 900 rounds per minute.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gib tries to hide behind the light-standard, which is about half as wide as he is. Shots hit all around him, shattering window glass behind him. His stomach sticks out from behind the pole. He sucks it in. Now his butt is sticking out on the other side. Shots clang into the steel column, and riddle everything behind him.

	<DIALOGUE>
	WRONG! THIS IS NOT GOOD!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIB>
<DIRECTION>
Just when it looks like Gib is going to get a 9mm tummy tuck, Malik turns and sprints away, through shocked pedestrians. Harry runs out of the restroom, trying for a shot, but there are too many people in the line of fire and Malik knows it.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get back to the car!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Gib nods and heads the other way as Harry takes off after Malik. Malik is fast and vicious. He hurls people out of the way, sending shoppers sprawling. Harry is ruthless in his pursuit. They pound through the mall and out onto the street--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malik sprints straight into traffic. A car screeches, not stopping in time... Malik goes right over the hood. Harry leaps over the hoods of cars after him. Malik sees Harry coming after him like a juggernaut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns and sees a MOTORCYCLIST coming down the street, accelerating from a right-turn. Malik runs at him, clothes- lining him right off the bike. The terrorist picks up the nimble little Kawasaki 250, which is still running, and leaps on. He pops the clutch and takes off. Harry pounds after him like a locomotive. He sees Malik turn, taking the bike path into a large PARK. Harry cuts into the park on a diagonal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON HARRY, running. Ahead is a MOUNTED COP. Harry doesn't break stride, heading right for the cop on the horse. The cop turns, surprised, a split second before-- Harry pulls him off the horse and slams him to the ground (he's wearing a helmet).
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Federal Officer in pursuit of suspect! Sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Harry is in the saddle and galloping after Malik before the cop can get his gut out of the holster to stop him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MALIK roars through the park on the Kawasaki. He looks back, amazed to see Harry charging after him on a horse. They scatter joggers and bicyclists, people walking their dogs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRACKING WITH THEM as they rocket through the park. Malik leaves the winding path and goes straight through the trees. Harry charges through some rollerbladers who go sprawling. Malik fires his Beretta straight back at Harry, emptying it. He drops the pistol and crouches over the bike, twisting the last bit of throttle out of it. They are going flat out, through the trees, in a kinetic blur.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - NEAR MALL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gib, panting and heaving, pulls his car into traffic. The Unit Seven car pulls out as well, up the block.

EXT. PARK/ STREETS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry is legging the police horse hard. He has his reigns in one hand, his Glock in the other. It's the wild west.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Westbound in the park... suspect is on a motorcycle... he's going to come out on Franklin. Hang on--

	</DIALOGUE>
</GIB>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
ON GIB, mouthing "Your horse?"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - NEXT TO PARK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malik explodes through the bushes and out onto the street. Cars skid around him, out of control. He turns south. Weaving through traffic. Harry leaps the hedgerow behind Malik and gallops among the spun-out cars. He goes right over the hood on one which is blocking his path. The driver ducks as the horse's hoof cracks the windshield.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET/ HYATT REGENCY HOTEL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Up ahead traffic is stopped, jammed tight at a light. Malik goes into the oncoming traffic lanes, which are empty. Gib's car slides around the corner in a blare of horns and comes barrelling down the street toward him. Gib cranks the wheel the slides the car broadside, blocking both lanes. Malik locks up the brakes and the bike slides to a stop. Then the terrorist pops the clutch and wheels the bike around-- Jumping the curb and going straight at the entrance of THE HYATT REGENCY HOTEL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bellmen and guests scatter as the bike roars right at them. The sliding doors and opening for a bellman coming out with bags and Malik blasts past him into the lobby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HARRY ducks, galloping through the doors after him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Acres of marble and red carpet. Liveries porters. Guests dressed for evening, the men in suits, diamonds on the women. And sudden pandemonium as Malik roars through the lobby, with Harry charging along behind him. Malik guns it across the lounge, knocking over tables. He gets air at the top of the steps going up to the RESTAURANT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry swerves to avoid a panicking guest and finds himself careening toward the JAZZ QUARTET at a full gallop. He gathers the animal and LEAPS (in glorious SLOW MOTION) over the bassist, who is diving for the carpet. Harry and horse land deftly and then he urges his mount right up the steps after Malik.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malik roars between the tables, looking around wildly for a way out. Harry charges in, ducking to avoid the chandelier. Waiters, trays, dinners, tables... everything seems to be flying at once as people dive out of the way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL - MAIN HALL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MALIK skids out into the main hall by another door, and sees-- the ELEVATORS. The door is just closing on one of them. He guns it and slides through the doors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HARRY RIDES out of the restaurant in time to catch a glimpse of Malik as the doors close.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SCENIC ELEVATOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry canters the horse into the next elevator, which has just been boarded by an older couple. He has to practically lie down on the horse to fit through the door. The animal barely fits, nose to tail, in what turns out to be--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A GLASS ELEVATOR with a view of the whole atrium of the hotel as it rises, right to the top of the building. Harry looks through the glass at the elevator car next to him, fifteen feet away. Malik is inside, punching a button. He glances up and sees Harry. There eyes meet for a moment, just before Malik's car ascends rapidly. Malik's malevolent glare is etched on Harry's retinas.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The older couple is jammed against the side-wall by Harry's panting, snorting horse. It clomps around the tight elevator. The woman is trying to crawl between her husband and the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you just press the top floor, please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
The man nods mutely and complies. Their elevator takes off, rising after Malik's.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gib runs in with Faisil and Keough. They follow the path of destruction, growing more and more amazed. Gib yells to one of the porters.
</DIRECTION>
<GIB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The guy on the horse?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIB>
<DIRECTION>
The porter points at the elevators.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. SCENIC ELEVATORS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry has slid off the horse to get next to the control panel. He can look up at an angle and see Malik in the car above him. His thumb hovers over the emergency stop button. If Malik gets out at any floor, Harry will have a moment to react and stop. Malik can look down and see this. He knows Harry's got him. He just keeps going, floor after floor, using the time to think.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The older woman is still just staring, trying not to breathe. The horse flicks her in the face with his tail.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. /EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rooftop has a spectacular view of the city. TRACKING WITH Malik as he comes out of the elevator, rides to the far edge of the roof and slides to a stop. He looks down twenty stories.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SECOND ELEVATOR arrives. The doors part and Harry comes out, with his Glock poised and ready. He sees Malik revving his bike. The terrorist brodies the bike into a fast one- eighty and speeds back toward the edge of the roof. Amazingly, he increases speed, ROARING RIGHT OFF THE EDGE, ARCING THE BIKE SUICIDALLY OUT INTO SPACE!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry rides to the edge in time to see Malik, on his bike, CLEAR A 60 FOOT JUMP and SPLASH INTO THE ROOFTOP POOL of a LOWER BUILDING next to the hotel!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry is out of control now, seeing the guy setting away. He wheels his mount and charges across the roof to get some running space. Then he turns again, back toward the edge Malik jumped from. He kicks the horse's flanks and yells HAAHH!! The horse's hoofs thunder on the roof as they go full tilt toward the edge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But a horse is not a motorcycle. It is slightly smarter. It slams its front hoofs down together, stopping suddenly. Harry goes right over its head. He flies forward, almost going right off the roof. He slams to the edge, with his legs dangling over, holding onto a piece of pipe with one hand. His Glock tumbles down into darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry sees Malik far below, climb out of the pool, running to the roof door of the other building. Getting away. Harry clambers up onto his own roof, breathing hard. He walks over to the horse.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell were you thinking? We had the guy and you let him get away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
He looks into the horse's innocent brown eyes. Pats its neck fondly.

INT. TASKER HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

Helen is asleep at the dining room table next to a half-eaten cake and some melted ice cream. His unopened presents are piled at one end of the table. She raises her head as Harry enters sheepishly.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I know you're upset. I'm really sorry, honey. I raced home as quick--

<HELEN>

He goes to her and puts his arms around her. He is tender with her. He wishes he can tell her the truth.

<HARRY>

	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. It was great.

Helen finds a smile for him somewhere. She really does love him, though more and more often lately she finds her heart in pain.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go to bed, Harry. There's only one present you have to open tonight.

She grins and arches one eyebrow meaningfully.

INT. BEDROOM / BATHROOM - NIGHT

Helen walks Harry to the edge of the bed and sits him down. She puts her hand on his chest and pushes, causing him to lie back.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't move. I'll be right back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
She turns on the stereo. A Kenny G disc she put in there earlier. Soft tenor sax flows around the room. Helen enters the BATHROOM and shuts the door partway. She opens a cupboard and quickly pulls out some things she hid there earlier. A bottle of champagne on ice. Two glasses. Some trashy lingerie.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on to bed, you don't have to brush your teeth.

	I couldn't believe it. I go back to get this report I need, right, and the phone is ringing, so like a bonehead I answer it--
	</DIALOGUE>

Helen is hurrying to put on the unfamiliar lingerie. G-string panties and low-cut bra. She holds up the garter belt, turning it backward and forward, trying to figure out which way it goes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON HARRY, yawning. Lying with the ease of years of practice.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>

Helen is pulling up the black stockings. She fastens the garters to the tops. Her features are a scowl of concentration. She is very earnest in her preparations.

</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a second.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
Helen quickly pours two glasses of champagne. Then she slinks around the doorframe, making her entrance. She looks like a living 900 number. Helen stands before the bed, looking down, holding the champagne glasses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON HARRY: sprawled on the bed, fully clothed, snoring softly. A little bit of drool is coming out the side of his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HOLD ON HELEN, all dressed up with no place to go. She gazes down at him, her shoulders slumping.

	She's having an affair.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Harry's best friend in the world brightens with the news. He slaps him on the back.
</DIRECTION>
<GIB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Congratulations. Welcome to the club.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIB>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It can't be. Not Helen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<GIB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nobody believes it can happen to them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIB>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It can't be.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<GIB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Same thing happened to me with wife two. I had no idea until I came home and the house was empty. I mean empty. She even took the ice-cube trays from the fridge. What kind of person would think of that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIB>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(not listening)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I still don't believe it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<GIB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Relax. Helen still loves you. She just wants this guy to bang her. It's nothing serious. You'll get used to it after a --

</GIB>
<DIRECTION>
Harry wheels around on Gib, grabbing him by the lapels, and slams him against the car.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	STOP. CHEERING. ME. UP.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
We see in Harry's rage, frustration, and hurt confusion a vulnerability we never expected to see.
</DIRECTION>
<GIB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What'dya expect Harry? She's a flesh and blood woman. And you're never there. It was only a matter of time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIB>
<DIRECTION>
Harry sags. His friend is right. Gib opens the car door and helps him in like an invalid, talking soothingly the whole time--
</DIRECTION>
<GIB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I say we concentrate on work. That's how I always got through it whenever my life turned to dogshit. Let's catch some terrorists and then you can beat the crap out of them. You'll feel better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIB>
<DIRECTION>
Gib gets in and starts the car, full of stoic cheer for Harry.
</DIRECTION>
<GIB>

	Women. Can't live with 'em. Can't kill 'em.

INT. OMEGA SECTOR / LISTENING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry and Gib are in the LISTENING ROOM. Banks of tape-decks recording calls, rows of technicians in cubicles processing and collating transcripts.
</DIRECTION>
<GIB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's giving us a blank check on wiretaps. So I've set 'em up on all of Juno's shipping agents, her clients, and Faisil made up a list of possible contacts that Crimson Jihad might have in this country. Now all we can do is wait --
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIB>
<DIRECTION>
He notices Harry is not listening.
</DIRECTION>
<GIB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this national security stuff boring you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIB>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put a tap on her phone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<GIB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What're you talking about? We have that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIB>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Helen's phone. Her office line and the line at my house.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Gib gives Harry a stricken look, and glances around nervously. He pulls him into an empty office.
</DIRECTION>
<GIB>
<DIRECTION>
(a whispered hiss)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay . . .I have two words to describe that idea. In. Sane. Unauthorized wiretap is a felony, pard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIB>
<DIRECTION>
Harry grabs him and rams him up against the wall, his teeth clenched.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, and we do it twenty times a day. Don't give me that crap. Just put on the taps. Now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<GIB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, Harry. I'm on it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIB>
<DIRECTION>
Harry releases him and turns away. Gib straightens his jacket, looking at his friend like he's completely losing it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TASKER HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
That night Harry is actually there on time for dinner. He glances at Dana, who has been eyeing him warily. She looks at her peas.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How was school today?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANA>
<DIRECTION>
Harry takes a bite of his food, watching her. Silence. Helen glances at him.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So. You came by to see me today?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
She is a too casual, masking her nervousness.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was in the area, and I thought you might like to have lunch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They must've just missed me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They said you had to run out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. It was a rush thing. They needed some documents down at the court house. I barely made it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
Harry watches her lying to him with some amazement. You can see the jaw muscles clenching.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, a little excitement in an otherwise dull day. Did is work out okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, sure. Fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she gets up suddenly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll get some more gravy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm done.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANA>
<DIRECTION>
Dana bolts. She has eaten about four bites. Harry sits at the table, alone. He feels isolated, knowing that everybody is lying to everybody else. He is a man without a center, lost.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:

<DIRECTION>
INT. OMEGA SECTOR/ LISTENING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRACKING ALONG THE BANK OF RECORDERS. Harry comes to a particular set of machines. He reaches past the technician and picks up the hard-copy of the transcripts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON HARRY walking and leafing through the phone transcripts. Gib watches him through a glass partition, shaking his head slowly. Harry freezes, staring at the page and WE HEAR THE SOUND OF THE CONVERSATION OVERLAID:
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Helen? It's Simon. Is it safe to talk?

<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Go ahead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAR - FLASHBACK SEQUENCE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A man in his mid-thirties, sitting in a car SOMEPLACE (DAY), speaks into a cellular phone. This is SIMON. He is dark haired, and fairly good-looking in an off-beat way. He is unshaven and his clothes look slept in. He glances around in a furtive manner.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't talk long. Can you meet me for lunch tomorrow? I must see you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HELEN'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NOW WE SEE HELEN, at her office.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. I suppose so. Where?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The same place. One o'clock. I have to go now. See you tomorrow. Remember, I need you.

</SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LISTENING ROOM - DAY

The last line is played ON HARRY, reading. Now he is seeing the proof in black and white. He slowly crumples the paper in one hand, his expression dark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TASKER HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Helen is reading in bed. She glances up as Harry comes into the room. Gives him a quick smile. Too quick.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought we might have lunch tomorrow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't, honey. I promised Allison I'd go shopping with her. Sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
Harry watches her smoothly lying to him. It's surreal to him.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No problem.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
He surreptitiously picks up Helen's purse from a dresser and goes into the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TASKER HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FRONT DOOR OPENS and Harry comes out, walking Gizmo on a leash. Harry walks briskly along the sidewalk, jerking the poor dog along twice as fast as his little legs will go.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SIDEWALK, BY GIB'S CAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches Gib's car, half a block up, and hands him Helen's purse. Gib eyes the dog warily. He growls at it. Gizmo hides behind Harry's legs.
</DIRECTION>
<GIB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Harry. I know this is rough. I felt the same way the first time it happened to--
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIB>
<DIRECTION>
Harry holds up one finger. His eyes and expression are so intense, Gib just soft of trails off.
</DIRECTION>
<GIB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(hefting the purse)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So . . . the usual, right? GPS locator, telemetry burst transmitter, audio transmitter, power supply.

Harry drives while Gib watches--

<DIRECTION>
INT. SEDAN, CLOSE UP ON MAP - DAY
</DIRECTION>

A COMPUTERIZED MAP below the dash. Helen's purse appears as a moving blip on a street-map of the city.

<GIB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, she's turning on Seventeenth. Make a left, you should see her.

	There she is.

EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Up ahead they see Helen's RED ACCORD pulling into a parking low next to a CAFE. Harry parks the car a block away and gets out his binoculars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HELEN'S CAR THROUGH BINOCULARS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HARRY'S POV through the scope. Helen gets out of her car and looks around as she walks to the cafe. It is not a nervous look, but it is clear she is making sure she is not followed. She goes inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SEDAN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give me audio.

</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Gib hits a switch and they hear the clamor of the cafe at lunch rush come over a speaker.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAFE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The restaurant is nothing fancy. A little dark. Helen makes her way to a booth in the back. Sitting in the shadows, facing the door, is SIMON. She sits down opposite him. He doesn't smile or kiss her in greeting, but glances around the room like he expects a threat to leap out at any moment.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you sure you weren't followed?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I kept looking back, like you taught me. I didn't see anyone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. It's just, things are a bit hot for me right now. If I get a signal...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(holds up a cigarette lighter meaningfully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I may have to leave suddenly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I understand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's my job to risk my life, but not yours. I feel bad about bringing you into this, but you're the only one I can trust.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
Simon creates an atmosphere of danger. His haggardness give him an air of mystery and desperation.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where were you? On a... uh, mission?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ssshhh! We say Op. Covert operation. And this one got a little rough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Worse than Cairo?

<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but for who?

INTERCUT FROM HERE ON BETWEEN HARRY/GIB AND HELEN/SIMON.

SIMON puts a newspaper on the table, sliding it over to Helen.

<SIMON>

</SIMON>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.

</HELEN>
<SIMON>

HARRY AND GIB react, realizing that it is the story of their operation gone awry.

	Tell me what happened?

</HELEN>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, I can't.

</SIMON>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can trust me completely.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. But it would compromise your safety too much to know certain things.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right, of course. I was worried when I didn't hear from you that night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>

<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Were they trying to kill you?

</SIMON>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you chased one?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something came over me, I just had nail him, no matter what the risk. It was pretty hairy. I thought he had me, a couple of times. But I really can't take credit . . .

</SIMON>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't?

Simon is cruising in the Corvette with the radio blasting. Thinking he is supercool.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. USED CAR LOT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Simon pulls into a used car lot, which is a run-down place. A hodge-podge of makes and models, a few that might aspire to be classics.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Simon backs the Vette into an open space on the front line. He reaches into the back seat and pulls out a dayglo sign showing the SALE PRICE of the car. He sticks it back on the dash. The car doesn't even belong to him!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ACROSS THE STREET FROM CAR LOT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry and Gib pull up. They watch as Simon jumps out of the Vette and goes into the sales office.
</DIRECTION>
<GIB>

	He's a goddamn used car salesman. This just gets better.

	Sorry Harry, I know this is painful.

Harry's eyes are slitted down lethally as he stares across the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAR LOT SALES OFFICE - DAY (LATE AFTERNOON)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON A TAPE PLAYER, with Simon's hand adjusting the volume. The sound of traffic noise and middle-eastern music blares from the deck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULL BACK to see Simon on the phone, talking loud, as if over the din of a real place.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a great little bar, Amanda, you'd love it. Beirut's a great place if you know the city. Listen, this isn't a secure line. I'll tell you all about it when I get back tomorrow... if I live.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Scared? Never! Except of you--
	</DIALOGUE>

During this, the owner of the place, DOUG WURTZ, has come out of the back room and looked out at the lot. What Doug sees is--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HARRY, browsing among the cars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DOUG turns from the window and bears down on Simon, who sees him coming and speeds up his rap.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--I have to go, baby. A guy's coming toward me--
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
Doug grabs the phone out of his hand and slams it in the cradle.
</DIRECTION>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Simon, look out there. You see that man? Notice how he's looking at the cars. He's called a customer. I know it's been a while, but do you remember what you're supposed to do when we have a customer?

EXT. CAR LOT - DAY

Simon bounces jauntily up to Harry, talking before he's even reached him.

	<DIALOGUE>
	It wants you too. Feel it vibrate? How about a little spin?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
Simon opens the passenger door and sits Harry inside, then runs around the car. He leaps over the closed door into the driver's seat and starts the car.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMON>

	You gotta jump in. That's rule number one. It takes a little practice, but there's no way around it.

EXT. STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Simon swings the car out onto the boulevard, kicking back.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See, it's not just the car, it's a total image. An identity you have to go for. This isn't some high-tech sports car... it doesn't even handle that great. But that's not the idea, is it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
Simon gives Harry a big grin. Harry returns a knowing chuckle. Ha ha.

Simon laughs. Harry laughs. A big lusty, male-bonding kind of laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well then this is a vital piece of equipment. Used properly, it can change your life. See, you cruise. No racing. This ain't a Ferrari. You check out the scenery, let the scenery check you out. You got to take it slow. Old cars are like good women... they heat up fast.

Simon is holding court. Over tacos, he waxes eloquent on his greatest area of expertise. We see Harry laughing, going along with the guy. Pretending to bond.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's face it, Harry, the Vette gets 'em wet. But it's not enough. If you want to really close escrow, you gotta have an angle.

	And you've got one.

Simon leans forward, conspiratorially.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, just ask yourself. What do women really want? You take these bored housewives, married to the same guy for years. Stuck in a rut. They need some release. The promise of adventure. A hint of danger. I create that for them.

</SIMON>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you're basically lying your ass off the whole time? I couldn't do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, think of it as playing a role. It's fantasy. You have to work on their dreams. Get them out of their daily suburban grind for a few hours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Isn't that hard to keep up, in the long run?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doesn't matter. I like change. You know, constant turnover. As soon as I close the deal, it's one of two more times, then adios.

</SIMON>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Use 'em and lose 'em.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exactly. The trick is, you gotta pick your target. They have to be nice little housewife types. School-teachers. But, I'm telling you, you get their pilot lit, these babes, they can suck- start a leaf-blower.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about the husbands?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dickless. If they took care of business, I'd be out of business, know what I mean?

They are cruising along, with Harry driving this time.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You working on someone right now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I always have a couple on the hook. You know. There's one right now, I've got her panting like a dog. It's great.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
Unconsciously, Harry's hands clench the wheel tighter.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What does she do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some kinda legal secretary of something. Married to some boring jerk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
Harry takes a corner too fast. The tires squealing.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And she could be so hot, if she wanted to be. She's like a dying plant that just needs a little water.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
When Simon is looking, Harry is open and encouraging... they laugh together... then when he looks away Harry goes snake- eyed. He could kill Simon with one punch. He's visualizing his wife getting porked by this guy.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But with you, she gets to be hot, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Red hot. Her thighs steam.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
They laugh together. Harry's laugh is getting a bit brittle. He speeds up, his knuckles white on the wheel. Now for the big question: HAVE THEY OR HAVEN'T THEY?
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sooooo... she's pretty good in bed, then?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>

<DIRECTION>
EXT. USED CAR LOT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry comes barrelling into the lot at forty. He cranks the wheel and hits the emergency brake, slewing the car into a smoking bootlegger-180. It screeches backward, sliding right into its parking space perfectly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Simon is bugeyed. But he is non-plussed for only about two seconds. Then he's back to selling. He scrambles out and goes around to Harry, coughing in the cloud of tire smoke.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See. You and this car were meant for each other. Why fight it? Sure, I have a couple other buyers lined up, but I like your style. Whattya say? Should we start on the paperwork?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me think about it. Hold it a day for me?

Dana is momentarily puzzled by the reversal of roles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ENTRY WAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON HELEN, checking herself in the hall mirror. She looks at her big dowdy purse. Hating it suddenly. She pulls her pocketbook out and rummages on the top shelf of the hall closet for a small handbag, then charges out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. SEDAN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry is driving. Gib pulls a sheaf of pages out of his briefcase and hands them to him.
</DIRECTION>
<GIB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's today's transcripts. There's nothing interesting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIB>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing from Simon?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
Keeping one eye on the road, Harry riffles through the sheets. He glances at the top of the last couple of sheets. He scowls. Then SUDDENLY SLAMS ON THE BRAKES. The car dives to the curb, bumping one wheel. Harry gets out and charges around to Gib's side. Gib gets out, his expression blank.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give me the page.

Harry hammers his fist against the car-window right next to Gib. It explodes inward in a shower of glass.
</DIRECTION>
<GIB>
<DIRECTION>
(shrugging)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIB>

He fishes a crumples sheet of paper out of his pocket. Harry grabs it from him, straightening it.

He jumps back in the car and activates the GPS locator. Helen's purse-blip flashes on the grid map.

</GIB>
<DIRECTION>
Harry drives on, ignoring him. Gib grabs his shoulder, shaking him.

EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Helen pulls her car under the bridge. She checks her watch. Helen notices that her hand is shaking. She looks around and the place seems deserted. She is about to leave when she sees headlights flash briefly in the shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A red-and-white Vette emerges from the darkness and pulls up next to her. Simon motions for her to get in quickly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Simon makes a show of checking the mirrors.

	Now don't be alarmed... but if I'm spotter, it would be best if they don't see you. You should keep your head down until we're out of the city.

He pushes her head down onto his lap. She crouches there, with her cheek against his thigh. He's cruising along, loving it.

EXT. HIGHWAY LEAVING CITY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

It is a highway heading away from the city. IN A LONG LENS SHOT, the Vette appears over the brow of a hill. A moment later A HELICOPTER rises up behind them, A DRAMATIC REVEAL. It follows the Vette.
</DIRECTION>
<CONDOR>

<DIRECTION>
EXT. TRAILER PARK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The headlights of the Vette light up a ratty single-wide mobile home, on the outskirts of a TRAILER PARK off the highway. Simon and Helen get out of the car.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My place in the city is too hot right now. So is the penthouse in New York. But this place is secure.

INT. SIMON'S TRAILER - NIGHT

Helen feels awkward in the small, junky space. A tape deck is playing cool jazz. Simon hands her a glass of cheap wine. He clinks her glass with his.

</SIMON>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're going to Paris?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Helen, there's a double agent in my outfit... I don't know who. There's no one I can trust. Except you. Can you get away? Just for two days.

</SIMON>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. I have to think...

</HELEN>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here. Sit down. Be comfortable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
He clears a place for her on the bed, shoving clothes and magazines out of the way. She sits down and he tops off her glass from the wine bottle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BILLBOARD AND TRAILER PARK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The agents have gathered behind a billboard. Harry, Gib and the other three agents have donned black jumpsuits. They finish fitting battle-harnesses, then they grab black ski- masks. They don them in perfect unison. Commando precision. Harry leads off and they quick-time from behind the billboard, closing in on Simon's trailer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRAILER - NIGHT

Helen looks up at Simon and nods slowly.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. I'll do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
Simon shoots over and sits next to her, taking her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are incredibly brave. I have to remind myself the fear you must be feeling. I've lived like this for years, so I'm used to it. Every day when I get up, I think it might be my last. But it makes you appreciate life. And the moment. Because that may be all you have.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
He moves a little closer. Casting his spell.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To pull this cover story off, we have to look exactly like two people who are intimate with each other. The enemy can spot a fake easily.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
He puts his hand on her knee. She tenses up instantly.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see what I mean? That reaction would give us away in a second. Try to relax.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's just that... it's been sixteen years since anyone but Harry did that, I--
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Relax. There, that's better. Let yourself slip into the role.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
He puts his other arm around her shoulders and pulls her slowly into a kiss. This doesn't seem real to Helen. She finds herself not pulling away. He lowers her slowly until they are lying together on the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There you go. That's right...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
He slides his hand up her thigh. The fingers, stroking in little circles, slips under her skirt. And--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She suddenly EXPLODES, pushing on his chest, forcing him up off her.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	NO! Stop!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he keeps kissing her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get off me RIGHT NOW!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
Simon struggles with her. She gets one knee up under him and levers him up. She pushes him to a standing position. She sits up on the bed, straightening her skirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks forlorn and pathetic. Now he's going to try pleading...
</DIRECTION>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If not for me, do it for democracy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABOOM!! The back wall of the trailer is blown outward by tiny shaped-charges. The concussion throws Simon forward on top of her. Five BLACK-SUITED FIGURES swarm in, carrying machine pistols and flashlights.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRAILER - HARRY'S POV - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lit by the beam of the flashlight, he sees Simon on top of Helen, her knees up on either side of his hips. It looks bad. Simon and Helen sit up... stunned. They look like two rabbits in the headlights of a truck. She screams.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRAILER - ON SIMON - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reacting as all his years of bullshit have suddenly materialized as a nightmarish reality. He is stunned. Blinking, mouth hanging open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. TRAILER - SIMON'S POV - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHAT SIMON SEES -- Five demonic figures, backlit by the XENON LIGHT from a helicopter. Smoke and dust swirling in the rotor- wash. The figures lunge toward them, grabbing them both. Helen struggles fiercely as Gib (disguised) pulls her up. Harry yanks Simon to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gib comes out first with Helen. She struggles like a wildcat, frankly surprising the hell out of Harry. Simon is brought out, dazed and compliant. Helen whips around, KNEEING GIB right in the balls. Gib OOPHS and doubles over, and Helen runs for it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry leaves Simon with the other agents and runs after Helen. She sprints through the trees, Harry pounding after her. He grabs her and gets her in a headlock. She bites the hell out of his arm. Harry yells and lets her go, just as-- Keough runs up and matter-of-factly clips her on the head with his weapon. Standard operating procedure. Which is why he can't understand why Harry punches him, knocking him down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry supports a sagging Helen, gesturing sharply to the other agents and going RRRRR-RRRR to make his point (since he can't talk without her recognizing his voice). They head for the cars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM/OBSERVATION CHAMBER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An empty room with a single stool under a light, and a large two-way mirror. The door opens and Helen is escorted in by Keough, still wearing his jumpsuit. Helen has a black hood over her head. Keough undoes a pair of handcuffs, freeing her, then leaves quickly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Helen whips the hood off and blinks in the light. She wheels at the sound of the door locking and runs to it. Pulls twice on the handle, without effect. She crosses to the mirror and peers at her reflection, trying to see if anyone is there on the other side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GLASS is a dark chamber. We see Helen perfectly, peering in, though she sees nothing. Harry and Gib, in silhouette, sit at a console. Harry speaks into a microphone.
</DIRECTION>

	Sit down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

ON HELEN'S SIDE of the mirror we hear Harry's voice shifted by a DIGITAL PROCESSOR. It is a cold booming mechanical voice. Harsh and inhuman.

	He said he was an American agent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE CONTROL room we can see Harry, Gib and, through the glass, Helen. Their voices sound normal on this side.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How long have you been a member of his faction?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know anything about a faction. I just met Simon... or whatever his name is... a couple of weeks ago. I barely know him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<GIB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not what it looked like when we found you.

FLASHBACK SEQUENCE:

<DIRECTION>
INT. MALL - DAY/FLASHBACK
</DIRECTION>

We see Helen sitting at table at a mall near where she works, having a cappucino and a croissant.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	About two weeks ago I was at the mall, having coffee...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
Simon appears behind her, sort of stalking up to her. He approaches quickly the last few steps and slips into the seat next to her. His manner is furtive. He keeps looking around, as if for hidden assasins. He hands her a briefcase.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
(speaking very low)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep this for me. I can't afford to be taken with it. National security is at stake. I'll contact you if a can. Okay? Oh--
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
He seems to suddenly spot something OFF CAMERA and dashes off the other way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BUSINESS DISTRICT - DAY/FLASHBACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Helen walks back to her office building, carrying the briefcase. She keeps looking over her shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HELEN'S OFFICE - DAY/FLASHBACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She has the briefcase on her desk while she works. She keeps glancing at it as she types. Finally she hunches over it and starts picking the locks with a paper clip.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON SECOND LOCK, popping open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON HELEN as she opens the case. She gasps.

INSIDE THE CASE are the following items: A tiny camera, some loose tapes, some circuit diagrams, some transcripts that look like gibberish which must be ENCRYPTED, some street maps of Beirut, Rome and Berlin, and a Walther P.P.K. PISTOL. Helen, eyes wide, closes the case.

Through the trees is a sweeping view across the Potomac to Georgetown and Embassy Row. Helen is sitting on a park bench when Simon shows up, sitting beside her. She hands him the briefcase.

	Why did you continue to see him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He needed my help.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not because you were attracted to him?

Harry cuffs him on the shoulder. Signals with a scowl for him to stay out of it. Gib smirks. Harry's put him through enough shit the last couple of days, it's time for a couple digs.

	That's none of your goddamn business! What kind of questions are these?

Helen glowers at the mirror. Her hands are shaking and she hates it that they can probably see she is afraid.

</HELEN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did you need?

In verbalizing it she just feels smaller, more pathetic that she ever did. She hates the unseen voices for making for try to explain her deepest, unvoiced needs.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's so much I wanted to do in this life, and it's like I haven't done any of it. And the sand's running out of the hourglass. I want to be able to look back and say: See! I did that. It was wild and it was reckless and outrageous and I fucking did it!

</HARRY>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think so.

EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The unit-seven van pulls up in the spooky shadows under the bridge, stopping next to Helen's red Accord. The door slides open and Helen gets out, helped my black-garbed hands. She is wearing her hood, which is whisked off by one of the hands. She whirls in time to see the door slide shut and the van speed off. She watches it drive off into the night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROCK QUARRY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The van pulls up near the edge of a large quarry. The door opens and Simon is pushed out, followed by Harry, who is in his black jumpsuit and wearing a ski-mask. Gib follows as Harry guides Simon to the edge of a sheer drop. Harry whips off the hood and Simon takes in his surroundings.

Simon has ducked his head and won't look at Harry. Then it dawns... He looks up, brightening hopefully.

<SIMON>

	It's you! Hey, you still interested in that Vette at all?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>

</GIB>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No... I sell cars. That's all! Not even foreign cars. Nothing international, I swear. I'm no terrorist. Everything I said was a lie... you have to believe me. I'm actually a complete coward. If I ever even saw a gun I'd--

Harry whips his pistol out in one liquid motion and snaps the muzzle right in front of Simon's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- faint. Aahhh! Don't kill me. I'm not a spy. I'm nothing. I'm navel lint. I have to lie to women to get laid. And I don't score much. It's pathetic.

<DIRECTION>
(he looks down)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See, look... would a spy pee himself?

Harry is finally sickened by his grovelling. He pulls Simon away from the edge, then gestures with his gun.

<HARRY>

</HARRY>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Soon as I turn you'll shoot me.

Harry starts back to the truck. Simon stays right with him, facing him, terrified to turn away. Like a dog following him.

Gib finally shoves Simon back and Harry contemptuously cranks THREE ROUNDS into the ground by his feet, forcing him to dance backward. The two agents get into the van and tear off in a cloud of dust. Leaving Simon alone in the moonlight, miles from nowhere.

Harry spots something up ahead. He snaps his fingers and points, then whips a pair of gyro-stabilized binoculars to his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HARRY'S POV THROUGH SCOPE: Trent, on the Yamaha with Dana on the back, rides through the intersection up ahead. Dana bops to the sound coming over her walkman headphones as Trent zips between cars. Gib makes the turn, pulling in behind them at a distance.

<DIRECTION>
INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE WAREHOUSE, we see what it is that Dana has been doing when she skips school. A garage band of teenagers, mostly older than her, are playing loudly. Dana has the microphone, belting out a punchy cover of the old Cream classic "Sunshine of Your Love". The guitar parts have been industrial- ized, and it actually sounds pretty hip.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry watches from the shadows, standing behind a pillar not far from the stage. Watching his daughter gyrating in the spotlight. His reaction is hard to read.

The stage is plunged into darkness and the music stops abruptly. Before the band members can react, they hear the big metal doors rolling and sunlight blazes in. Dana stares into the glare, seeing an ominous silhouette standing there. The shadowy figure walks toward them.
</DIRECTION>

Harry appears through the doors, marching Dana by the arm. He walks her over to some industrial junk nearby, overgrown with weeds, and sits her down for a talk.

She is sullen, still mortified from getting dragged out in front of her friends.

She looks up at him, puzzled?

Dana stares at her father with a dawning awareness. This is not just some chump that she has to put up with. This is her father. He is a part of her. No matter what happens they are in this thing together. Tears start to run down her cheeks.

	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>

Harry smiles, reaching for more chicken. The phone RINGS. Helen controls the urge to run to it.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>

INT. OMEGA SECTOR - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
GIB, AT OMEGA SECTOR, uses the SPEECH SYNTHESIZER to disguise his voice.
</DIRECTION>
<GIB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen carefully. Go to the Hotel Marquis in one hour. Pick up an envelope marked Doris at the front desk. And dress sexy.

INT. TASKER HOUSE - NIGHT

</HELEN>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get going!

</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
(thinking for a second, then--)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh... well, okay then. You sound terrible. I'll run out right now. Just call the prescription in to the pharmacy. Sure, no problem. Bye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
Harry smirks, listening to her lie. She's good. The smirk drops as she turns.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Allison is sick in bed. I have to go over there, honey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, hon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
She walks unhurriedly out of the room. Behind her back, Harry is grinning. The second Helen is out of his sight line, she runs up the stairs. Harry waits a moment then picks up the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OMEGA SECTOR/ ELECTRONIC LAB -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gib is in a corner of the electronics lab, in an area dedicated to DIGITAL AUDIO PROCESSING. The phone in his briefcase rings. Gib answers.
</DIRECTION>
<GIB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've reached a new low with this one. I can't believe you're crazy enough to use the room at the Marquis.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIB>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not? You think I can afford a suite like that on my salary? Is Jean-Claude done yet?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Gib looks over at a SOUND RECORDING BOOTH nearby. In it a FAT FRENCH AGENT, JEAN-CLAUDE is doing voice recording from a hand- written page.
</DIRECTION>
<GIB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not quite.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIB>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OMEGA SECTOR - INSIDE THE BOOTH - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear Jean-Claude record a line on a tiny DAT tape recorder. He speaks with a cosmopolitan French accent. Close your eyes and he's Charles Boyer.
</DIRECTION>
<JEAN_CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No no. Do it slowly. Very slowly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEAN_CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL MARQUIS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A big luxury hotel downtown, with an opulent lobby. Helen enters, looking different than we have ever seen her. She has been commanded to be sexy, and she is. Her black slinky dress is cut at mid-thigh, showing some good legs we haven't been aware of. She's pulled her hair back and added pearls. Now she looks elegant and hot. Playing the role.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL - FRONT DESK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She goes to the front desk and signals the ASSISTANT MANAGER with her eyes. He comes over to her.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you have an envelope for Doris?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
The man nods. Saying nothing, he reaches under the counter and hands her the envelope. She opens it as she walks across the lobby. In contains a room key, a small bugging device, and a phone number.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON A PAY PHONE as Helen finishes dialing the number. She scans the lobby as the phone rings--
</DIRECTION>
<METALLIC_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen. You are a prostitute named Michelle. Go to the room. A man will be there. He is a suspected arms dealer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</METALLIC_VOICE>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do I have to... you know-- ?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. He has particular tastes. He likes to watch. You will say his regular girl, Carla, is sick. If he likes you, he will tell you what to do. You must plant the bug near the telephone, by the bed, before you leave. If you do not accomplish your mission, the deal is off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL/ TENTH FLOOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Helen exits an elevator and walks down the long hallway toward the suite. She stops by a mirror and checks her look. Decides she is too uptown. She pulls the neckline of her dress down so it shows more shoulder, then hitches up the hem. Ditches the pearls. Puts on some red lipstick.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now she doesn't look hot and elegant... just hot. She practices a slinky walk, getting into the role.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly she remembers her wedding ring. She pulls on it. It probably hasn't been off in years. She licks her finger and twists it off. Yoww! She puts it on her right hand and turns the modest diamond palm-side in . . . Out of site. Then, reading the number off the key, she goes to the room and unlocks the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SUITE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Helen comes in hesitantly. The lights are off. The suite is large and richly furnished, with a breathtaking view of the city. It is the room Harry was using, posing as Renquist. A FRENCH-ACCENTED VOICE comes from the next room.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
She goes into the bedroom. There is a dark figure sitting in a chair, just a silhouette.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Step into the light.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<DIRECTION>
It is a corner room. The drapes on one side are closed, shadowing the man, but open on the other just enough to let in a slash of moonlight. She steps forward into it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT CLOSE UP on the figure. We can just make out that it is Harry, though Helen cannot. TILT DOWN to show his hand, out of sight behind the chair-arm, as he manipulates the pause button on the DAT tape deck.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm Michelle. Carla's sick. She thought you might like me, so --
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
Harry goes SSSSHHHH. Silencing her gently. He silently clicks off the PAUSE button. The DAT recorder plays. Charles Boyer, deep and hypnotic, speaks from Harry's outline. Harry lipsynchs.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(TAPE)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me do the talking. You are very pretty. You may start by unzipping your dress.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
PAUSE button. She starts to yank the zipper down.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(TAPE)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No no. Do it slowly. Very slowly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Helen turns her back to him, and draws the zipper down languorously, revealing her creamy back. She is not wearing a bra.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(TAPE)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now slip the dress down... slowly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Helen is starting to get into the ritual. She lets the dress slip off her shoulders. It slides down her body to the floor. She steps out of it, still in high heels.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(TAPE)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now slide the nylons off one by one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
(puzzled)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not wearing any.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
Harry winces. He starts the next line immediately.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(TAPE)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's good. Now the panties.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
The ritual continues as she strips slowly (this will be tastefully done). She conceals the bugging device in her hand as she sets her clothes on the bed near the phone. Helen is still concentrating on her mission.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(TAPE)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now turn, cheri, in the moonlight. Let your body flow like water.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
She turns. Her skin is beautiful in the silvery light.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(TAPE)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now dance for me. Go on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Helen has no idea what to do, but she improvises quite well. The scrutiny of the shadowed man, who is fully clothed, and her raw vulnerability are a quiveringly powerful erotic combination.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(TAPE)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let your hands be a lover's hands on your own skin as you move. Yes, that's it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON Harry's eyes as he studies her. His game, meant to give her a dangerous fantasy, is actually turning him on mightily. He is amazed to see her playing the role, getting into it. This is not the Helen is thought he knew for sixteen years.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(TAPE)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, lie on the bed and close your eyes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
She does. Harry rises and goes to her, bringing the tape deck.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(TAPE)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep them closed. Do not open them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
He sits on the bed, next to her, but without touching her. He strokes her hair, lovingly. Then runs his fingertips over her eyes, down her cheeks. To her it feels delicate and delicious. Part of her is enjoying this a lot. But Helen is torn between wanting to flee and knowing that nothing the man has done so far is enough to cause her to abort her mission.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you only liked to watch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
Harry goes SSSHHH. It's all he can do. He bends over her and brings his lips slowly down to her. He touches them to hers so slowly that she barely knows he is kissing her. Then he takes her in a passionate kiss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And she grabs the lamp on the bedside table and SMASHES IT OVER HIS HEAD. Harry flies off onto the floor, groaning and semiconscious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Helen flips on the light and grabs her clothes, starting to dress rapidly. She still doesn't recognize Harry, who is face down. He groans and starts to rise. She kicks him in the ribs and finishes putting her dress on. She sticks the bug under the night table and grabs her shoes. Mission accomplished, motherfuckers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry grabs her ankle. She raises one shoe to kosh him again, and sees who it is. Freezeframe. Total shock. She can't even form the question.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harry-- ?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SUITE DOOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CRASH!! The door lock is shattered by tremendous force and THREE MEN burst into the room. We may recognize them as workers from Juno's shop. They are wielding pistols and are clearly part of Malik's terrorist brigade.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry is still groggy, and he doesn't want to start anything with Helen there, and risk her getting shot. He acquiesces as they pull him to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's got nothing to do with this. It's me you want, right?
	</DIALOGUE>

	Shutup, both of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEAD_TERRORIST>
<DIRECTION>
During this exchange, the thugs have handcuffed Harry's hands behind his back. The leader gestures to one of the men to bring Helen along. Helen and Harry are dragged roughly out of the room with pistol-muzzles stuck in their ribs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door from the corridor bangs open and the thugs hustle Harry and Helen down the fire-escape stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, you don't need him, he's nothing. He's a sales rep for a computer company, really--
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
The thug leader cuffs her across the head to shut her up.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was unnecessary.

INT. HOTEL BASEMENT - NIGHT

A stairwell door opens and the terrorists rush Harry and Helen through the basement labyrinth.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>

	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>

A pistol muzzle is jammed hard behind Helen's ear.
</DIRECTION>
<TERRORIST_LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Talk again, I kill you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRORIST_LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
They are hustled across a loading dock to a RENTAL VAN waiting with the door open. A fourth terrorist slides the van door shut after they get in and gets in behind the wheel. The van takes off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. AIRPORT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rental van pulls up to a G-3 JET warming up outside a private hanger. The van doors open and the hostages are brought out. Harry sees a long black LIMO pulling up behind the van. The driver, an enormous man names AKBAR, hurries to open the passenger door. A slender pair of ankles emerge, followed by the rest of Juno Skinner, looking devastatingly beautiful but now quite sinister.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
To Helen it is like a living James Bond film, with the jet, the limo, the terrorists, and now an exotic femme fatale, dressed to kill, approaching them.
</DIRECTION>

INT. G-3 JET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They enter the luxurious passenger cabin of the plane. Helen has never seen anything like this.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Harry's not part of this. He's just a sales rep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, my dear, he is a federal agent. He killed two of my colleagues the other night.

<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Juno, this is just some whacko hooker I met in the bar.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
AKBAR and the other terrorists push Helen and Harry into seats and strap them in.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harry, what's the matter with you? Tell them the truth. We're married, we have a daughter--
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(looking at Helen contemptuously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know what this crazy bitch is on. You should just cut her loose, so we can get down to business.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yeah? Oh yeah? Then where did I get this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
Helen grabs the locket, dangling on a chain around her neck, and opens it to show Juno.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE PICTURE IN THE LOCKET -- Harry and Helen together, smiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry roles his eyes. Great, Helen. A FLIGHT HOSTESS walks up carrying a tray. Juno smiles graciously at Helen.
</DIRECTION>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something before take-off?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNO>
<DIRECTION>
The hostess whips a PNEUMATIC INJECTOR off the tray and zaps Helen in the shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oooowww!! That hurt. You biii--
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
She slumps. Juno looks at Harry.
</DIRECTION>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She was telling the truth, wasn't she Harry? She really doesn't know. Interesting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNO>
<DIRECTION>
Juno nods and the hostess zaps Harry. He slides into unconsciousness as the plane engines begin to SCREAM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. AIRPORT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The G-3 lifts into the night sky, turning south.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PIER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small FREIGHTER is tied up to a half-crumbling pier. Next to the pier is a dilapidated corrugated-metal warehouse building, two stories high. There are floodlights on the dock but beyond is black night, with the ghostly shapes of mangroves and palms. It is an abandoned facility on what appears to be a tiny island in the Caribbean.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a lot of activity. Three U-RENT TRUCKS are parked by the warehouse, as well as some other vehicles. About thirty men, clearly CRIMSON JIHAD TERRORISTS are busy at various activities. Many of them carry AK47 assault rifles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MALIK is supervizing them as they finish unloading a tarp- covered object about 15 feet high from the ship. A rusting gantry crane trundles it into the warehouse. Malik looks up as an AEROSPATIALE HELICOPTER thunders toward them over the black Caribbean water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The helicopter lands and Juno steps down from the front door. The sliding door is opened and Akbar and the others pull a groggy Harry and Helen out of the aircraft. They are covered by hoods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malik walks up to them and pulls their hoods off. Harry takes in his surroundings and looks back into the eyes of Malik. Lethal energy flows between them.
</DIRECTION>
<MALIK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who is this woman?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALIK>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His wife.

</MALIK>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malik leads the entourage into the warehouse, where brilliant floodlights illuminate--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THREE HUGE STONE FIGURES, lined up in the middle of the space. The tarp is removes from the object they just unloaded, revealing a FOURTH STATUE. The figures are cracked and obscured by centuries, but they are unmistakably warriors mounted on horseback. The legs and arms are missing on some, but the massive heads and necks remain.
</DIRECTION>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Incredible, aren't they? Warrior figures from the Persian Empire of Darius the First, around 500 BC. I call them "The Four Horsemen".
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNO>
<DIRECTION>
She approaches the nearest figure, caressing its flank. A man with a jackhammer steps up to her.
</DIRECTION>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're absolutely priceless.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNO>
<DIRECTION>
She shrugs and nods to the man with the jackhammer. He blasts right into the body of one of the Horseman, destroying it. Stone fragments fall away, revealing a cavity cut with great precision inside the figure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside is a BRIGHT METAL CONTAINER. Four terrorists pull it out and set it on the ground. It is six feet long and coffin- like. Malik steps up to it, his eyes glistening. A hush has fallen over the group.
</DIRECTION>
<MALIK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Open it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALIK>
<DIRECTION>
The latches are released and the lid lifted. Inside is machined metal object, roughly conical, about five feet long. Malik signals to Harry to step closer and look.
</DIRECTION>
<MALIK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know what this is?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALIK>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you give me a clue? It could be a water heater for all I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Malik grabs Helen, jerking her roughly forward. He whips out a knife and inserts the point under Helen's jaw, forcing her head back and drawing blood.
</DIRECTION>
<MALIK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know why you have been brought here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALIK>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	N-no.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MALIK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So that this man can verify to the world that Crimson Jihad is now a nuclear power.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALIK>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How can Harry do that? He's a salesman for chrissakes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MALIK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If we were wrong about him... then the last thing you see will be your blood spraying in his face.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALIK>
<DIRECTION>
Harry steps forward, his face grim.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is a Soviet MIRV-Six, from an SS-22N launch vehicle. The warhead contains 14.5 kilos of enriched uranium, with a plutonium trigger. The nominal yield is 10 kilotons.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(in Arabic, subtitled)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Release her and I'll cooperate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Malik lowers the knife from her jaw. He turns away from her like she has ceased to exist and yells at the terrorists to remove the other weapons. Jackhammers tear into the stone figures.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Helen is just staring at Harry, her mouth open. He turns to her, not knowing what to say. He shrugs sheepishly.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What can I say? I'm a spy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
She just looks at him for a long time. She moves closer, staring and staring, letting it sink in. Then she hauls off and slugs him right in the jaw so hard is almost knocks him down.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You bastard!! You lying son of a bitch!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
Terrorists grabs her and restrain her. She starts to cry.

<DIRECTION>
NEARBY, Akbar is going through the contents of Helen's handbag and Harry's wallet. He rips open the bottom stitching and pulls out the geo-positioning transmitter.
</DIRECTION>
<AKBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Abu! Look at this!
	</DIALOGUE>
</AKBAR>
<DIRECTION>
Malik looks at the tracker and then smashes it to the floor. Helen looks at the crushed transmitter. She stares at Harry with dawning realization.

Juno cracks up at this.

The camera swings off Harry to Malik, standing before the rest of the Jihad warriors, who are assembled behind the four bombs.
</DIRECTION>
<MALIK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have killed our women and children, bombed our cities from afar like cowards, and dare to call us terrorists--

<DIRECTION>
Over the image of Malik, a LOW-BATTERY warning begins to flash.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO SCENE, as Malik speaks into the camera, which is head by one of his men. The CAMERAMAN is sweating, wondering if he should interrupt. He gulps nervously as Malik drones on.
</DIRECTION>
<MALIK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- But now the Oppressed have been given a mighty sword, to strike back at their enemies. Unless the US pulls all military forces out of the Persian Gulf area, immediately and forever, Crimson Jihad will rain fire on one major US city each week until these demands are met...

In a burst of static the image GOES BLACK.

INT. BUILDING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A filthy, crumbling cinderblock building (near the warehouse). A few bare light bulbs with bugs zipping around then, and no glass in the windows. Harry and Helen are brought in by two TERRORIST GUARDS. Juno follows then into the bleak room. Guards shackle them to steel chairs with handcuffs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MAN enters the room carrying a small suitcase. He has skull- like features. He opens the suitcase and Harry has a good view of the contents: medical instruments, needle-probes, drills, Dremel tools with saw blades.
</DIRECTION>
<JUNO>

</HELEN>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Samir is just going to ask Harry a few questions. See, we're not even sure which agency Harry works for. Now, Samir is absolutely first class, but on the other hand we have Harry, here, who has managed to lie convincingly to the woman he loves for 15 years. So it will be interesting to see how long he can resist.

</JUNO>

She kneels down in front of Harry, stroking his leg.
</DIRECTION>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think I care about their cause? Or yours? Not at all. See, America is on top now . . . but so was Rome, once. All civilizations crumble. One nation succeeding over another. What does it mean in the long run? The only important thing is to live well. And... living well takes money.

Juno puts her arms around him and kisses him passionately. She breaks, looking at Helen to savor the effect. Helen is trembling with rage.
</DIRECTION>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks for everything, Harry. It was good while it lasted.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNO>
<DIRECTION>
Juno crosses to the guard and takes a hand-grenade off his belt. Then she goes to Helen and places it between her knees. She pushes Helen's knees together to hold the spoon against the grenade then pulls the pin.
</DIRECTION>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now just keep your knees together, and you'll be fine.

Helen doesn't believe him, and why should she. She looks up from staring at the grenade, to see that Harry's head has slumped forward.

INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

INT. TORTURE ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Samir lifts Harry's head and sees that he is pretty shitfaced.
</DIRECTION>
<SAMIR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is there anything you would like to tell me before we start?

</SAMIR>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see. How exactly?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMIR>
<SAMIR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I thought I'd break your neck, then use you as a human shield, then kill the guard with that knife there on your table and take his gun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMIR>
<DIRECTION>
Samir approaches Harry with a long steel needle probe.
</DIRECTION>
<SAMIR>
<DIRECTION>
(humoring Harry)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what makes you think you can do all that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMIR>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I picked the lock on these handcuffs...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
He holds them up to show Samir. Then he explodes out of the chair-- Breaks the torturer's neck-- Spins him between himself and the guard-- Who then hesitates to fire-- Giving Harry the split second he needs to grab the knife from the table and throw it into the guard's eye, killing him instantly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Helen is flat blown away. Wow. It only took a few seconds for Harry to reverse the situation. Her Harry! He picks up the guard's 9mm pistol and staggers over to her.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't move.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
He kneels down in front of her. Gently he slips his hands between her thighs, getting a grip on the grenade, then sliding his fingers slowly over the spoon to hold it securely.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stops moving, suddenly. She realizes with a sudden jolt of terror that he has frozen.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>

</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BUILDING - NIGHT

Harry and Helen emerge from the building, creeping through the shadows. She stops him for a second. Gets very close to him, whispering, crouched in the shadows.

</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SWAMP - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry takes her hand and they sprint for cover at the edge of the mangrove swamp. A LIGHT HITS THEM. TWO TERRORISTS, running around the corner, open fire with AK47s just as Harry and Helen reach a cluster of palm trees. The trunks explode with bullet hits as they run through the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the two terrorists move through the trees, Harry lunges from the shadows and grabs one from behind. He wrests his rifle away and swings it at the other, knocking his AK down. The first terrorist draws a knife and slashes at him, but Harry grabs his knife arm and swings the blade into his partner. Then he elbow smashes the first guy and seizes him in a two- hand neck-breaker-- SNAP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two more run around the corner of a building. Harry stomps his foot down on one of the AKs, which is lying across a log. It flips into the air and he catches it in firing position . . . and takes them out with two well-aimed bursts. Helen comes out of the shadows staring at Harry in amazement. His shirt is ripped, he is scratched and bleeding, holding an assault rifle expertly and scanning the brush like a feral animal.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>

</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOOKING DOWN FROM A CATWALK on the activity below the four horsemen statues and several utility trucks almost fill the floorspace. A rental truck is being loaded with conventional weapons, including machine guns and several HAND-LAUNCHED STINGER MISSILES. One of the nukes has been lowered into a pit cut in the concrete floor. Malik and most of the terrorists are gathered around it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A GUARD, F.G. on the catwalk, watches intently from the railing. So intently that he doesn't head Harry sneak up on him. SNAP. Harry catches the guard's MAC-10 machine pistol before it can hit the floor. He and Helen crouch behind a steel pillar, watching the proceedings below. Helen keeps glancing at the dead guard, killed so effortlessly a moment before by her husband. It is all surreal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BELOW, MALIK is shouting in his native language. He pulls a chain from around his neck and holds up a METAL ARMING KEY. Then jumps down into the pit and inserts it into the warhead's arming computer. Harry is listening intently, translating for Helen.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In ninety minutes a pillar of holy fire will rise at this place as a sign to out enemies.

	It is done...

Malik jumps out of the pit. He signals and terrorists pour concrete into the pit, covering the bomb. He begins ranting again.

INT. WAREHOUSE - DOWN BELOW - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malik raises his fist and chants some Crimson Jihad slogans. The terrorists echo and chant and then cheer, firing their guns in the air. Harry pulls Helen back as ricochets clatter all over the inside of the metal building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malik shouts something and all the terrorists go back to work at double time. They are loading warheads Two and Three onto trucks (one per truck) and the last, number Four, is being wheeled out on a cart to the Aerospatiale outside.

She nods gamely and Harry starts down the steel stairs to the floor below.

<DIRECTION>
INT. WAREHOUSE - MAIN FLOOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON HARRY, reaching the floor. He slips behind some packing crates. Then swings into action-- He hurls the grenade as hard as he can, down to the other end of the building. KABOOM!! He uses the distraction to move forward. But it goes wrong almost right away... A TERRORIST comes around a corner behind him, shouts-- Harry dives for cover as the guy fires, but-- He trips on a pipe and goes sprawling-- Losing the AK47, which slides under some equipment and-- Seven terrorists run toward him, with guns raised.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>

	SHOOT!!

INT. WAREHOUSE - CATWALK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HELEN fires a burst at the terrorists, actually hitting one! But-- The recoil knocks her back, into a metal column, and the gun
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLIES OUT OF HER HANDS. It falls to the metal steps and hits-- Going off. B-B-BLAM! The burst kills two more terrorists, and-- The Mac-10 cartwheels and hits further down. ANOTHER BURST. Another terrorist is splattered.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It spins and hits another step-- ANOTHER RANDOM BURST MIRACULOUSLY KILLS THE LAST TWO TERRORISTS!!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She has inadvertently saved her husband. Harry looks up from behind cover-- to see all seven dead. Now it's his turn to be amazed. He signals to her to run... get off the exposed catwalk. She makes it through the door to the outside stairs as bullets start hitting the steel walls behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WAREHOUSE - MAIN FLOOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A TERRORIST with a knife runs at the unarmed Harry. Harry snatches up a jack-hammer and BRAT-TAT-TAT-- Drives it into the guy's chest. Then he-- Grabs an AK from one of the fallen terrorists and opens fire. Malik shouts to the drivers of the trucks to get going. The other terrorists return fire at Harry-- Who sprints from cover to cover, reaching a side door-- Where he rakes one of the passing trucks with a burst-- But terrorists behind him in the building have a clear shot and rounds hit the wall next to him as he-- Dives through the door--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

50 yards away. She is unarmed and unable to help.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WAREHOUSE - BEHIND A REFUELING TRUCK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HARRY cranks up the pump on the refueling truck and grabs the nozzle of the hose. He opens the flow and-- A stream of JET- FUEL blasts out of the nozzle and-- Harry fires his AK right across the nozzle-- The muzzle-blast ignites the av-gas and he has a flame thrower with a 70 foot reach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry, lit demonically by the inferno, paints the whole area, setting vehicles afire, and scattering the terrorists.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Through the flames and smoke he sees one of the men hand Malik a LAW rocket. Malik snaps it to his shoulder, preparing to fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DOCK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry runs toward the edge of the dock thirty feet away as-- MALIK fires. The rocket shoots toward the truck and-- Harry leaps toward the dark water as-- KABOOOM! Behind him the gas truck EXPLODES IN A HUGE FIREBALL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. UNDERWATER - OFF THE DOCK - NIGHT

A PISTOL ENTERS FRAME. Its muzzle taps the back of her head. She gasps and turns to see-- JUNO, holding the weapon expertly.
</DIRECTION>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My condolences to the window.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNO>
<DIRECTION>
Juno grabs her and yanks her to her feet. Helen SLAPS JUNO HARD. Juno has a slash across her cheek. Blood trickles down. She grabs Helen's hand and viciously turns it, seeing the wedding ring turned inward, the diamond on the palm-side. Her face darkens with fury and she points the gun at Helen's face, preparing to kill her . . .
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And Malik's hand grabs her wrist, stopping her.
</DIRECTION>
<MALIK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not now. We may need a hostage.

Juno grabs her and twists her around, pushing her toward the limo nearby.

<DIRECTION>
Amid the fire and smoke, he sees Juno walking Helen at gun point toward a LIMO.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRACKING WITH JUNO, approaching the car. Malik passes, jumping into the Aerospatiale with his few remaining men. The fourth bomb is clearly visible as the sliding door is closed. The copter pulls pitch, fanning the flames of the inferno below as it arcs away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AKBAR, the 300 pound terrorist/chauffeur opens the door and Juno gets into the limo with Helen. Akbar scrunches into the front seat and starts the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RAMP TO HIGHWAY - PREDAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is just enough light to see some geography. The island is very tiny. Running right over it and to the horizon in both directions is the OVERSEAS HIGHWAY. The terrorists' trucks rumble up an on-ramp past a sign that says MIAMI - 110. The limo is the last member of the convoy. The Aerospatiale passes overhead, hugging the deck, headed for Miami at 150 knots.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DOCK/ WAREHOUSE - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It looks like the aftermath of a battle... burning wreckage, black smoke, bodies. Not a living soul around. The smoke swirls as two big BELL 206 HELICOPTERS settle on the middle of the dock. GIB jumps out of the nearest with an AR-15, scanning the wreckage. Several of his men, and a couple of DEA agents, spread out. Gib breaks into a grin as he sees--

Helen uses this moment of distraction to lunge forward, grabbing the gun. Juno fires wildly as they struggle for control of the weapon. The sound is deafening in the tiny space.

HARRY'S HAND grabs Helen's. He pulls her out of the car just as the limo clears the edge. She is jerked through the sunroof, screaming. The car falls away, arcing gracefully to the ocean below. It hits with an enormous explosion of water.

Then she looks at Harry and-- Grins. She's alive! And so is he. And not only that, this is the biggest rush of her life. Harry grins back. Surprised and pleased that she is more of a soul-mate than he ever knew.

They are in no danger, but the effect is stunning. The classic mushroom cloud appears at the horizon. Helen watches, awed, the most glorious and terrifying sight of our age.

She watches Malik go to the warhead and insert his arming key. He has a TV set up on some crates, and we see that his video- tapes demands are running on CNN. Harry's face fills the screen, verifying the the nuclear weapons as a real threat. He is identified at the bottom of the screen as HARRY TASKER, ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION.

She reaches the corner of the building. Her back touches something. it is the boom of a small crane, used for lifting building supplies. Careful to keep the key dangling over open space, Dana climbs up on the lattice-work boom and moves out beyond the edge of the building, never taking her eyes off Malik. She is hyperventilating, terrified, but thinking clearly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malik steps up on the crane, crawling out after her. He knows she will not drop the key as long as he has the gun. It is a game which will end when she reaches the end of the boom. Dana puts the key between her teeth so she can hang on better. It is windy and the boom is swinging.

Dana is laughing too, a part of it. They are happy. They are a family. Dana gets up, her meal half-eaten as usual.
</DIRECTION>
<DANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm done.

Dana trudges off to her room to do her homework. The phone rings. Helen answers.

INT. EMBASSY PARTY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a black tie affair. Very glitzy. CAMERA SWOOPS over the guests, sipping champagne and dancing. It is an embassy crowd, very international. HARRY AND HELEN work their way through the crowd. He is in tux, hair slicked back, looking rakish. She is elegant in a low-cut gown and diamond choker.

<DIRECTION>
Harry scoops two glasses of champagne off a passing tray and hands her one.

<DIRECTION>
INT. VAN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VERY CLOSE ON GIB, hunches in a dark van someplace nearby. He speaks into his headset mike.

<GIB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, what's the scoop, team? You see your contact yet?

INT. PARTY - NIGHT

HELEN AND HARRY smile and nod as if they know people. Speaking very low, Helen answer Gib via SUB-VOCAL transceiver.

	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>

He whirls her across the floor and the CAMERA PULLS BACK AND UP as they dance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The END
