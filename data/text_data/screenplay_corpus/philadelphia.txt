INT. - DAY - TWO STORY HIGH CORRIDORS THAT REEK OF HISTORY .

<DIRECTION>
Young lawyer JAMEY COLLINS darts through the crowd, carrying an accordion file under his arm like a football.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jamey elbows his way through a JAPANESE TOUR GROUP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jamey trots up a marble staircase, two steps at a time
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TO:

<DIRECTION>
JAMEY RUNS LIKE HELL DOWN A THIRD FLOOR CORRIDOR, FOOTSTEPS making a racket...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jamey rushes toward a door marked "JUDGE TATE."

RAISED VOICES from inside Judge Tate's chambers:

	This construction site is causing mortal and irreparable harm to an unsuspecting public!

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My client has one of the finest and most respected safety records in the business, Your Honor!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDREW_BECKETT>
<DIRECTION>
Jamey shoves open the door, REVEALING TWO LAWYERS (BACKS TO CAMERA) STANDING BEFORE JUDGE EUNICE TATE: ANDREW BECKETT (in conservative gray) and JOSEPH MILLER (in pinstripes).
</DIRECTION>
<JUDGE_TATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One at a time. Mr. Miller?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE_TATE>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your Honor, since Rockwell Corp. began construction, the surrounding residential neighborhood has been enshrouded in a cloud of foul-smelling, germ-carrying, pestilent dust. My client is being forced to breathe known carcinogens daily! Other residents are coming forth on a daily basis to add their voices of outrage!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<ANDREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your Honor, I submit there were no complaints until Counselor began knocking on doors, drumming up business. And the dust, which Counselor refers to, has appeared on only three occasions. Each time it has been examined and the results...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDREW>
<DIRECTION>
Behind his back, Andrew wiggles his fingers. Jamey stuffs a document into Andrew's hand.

<ANDREW>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT.)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Limestone. Messy, but innocuous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDREW>

Andrew submits the report to the Judge.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Innocuous?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<ANDREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Defined by Webster's as harmless.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDREW>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know what it means. Your Honor, imagine how the children in this neighborhood have been made to feel. The pounding of construction ringing in their ears as this skyscraper, a tribute to mankind's greed, grows daily, casting an ominous shadow over their lives, filling them with dread even as they are surrounded in a black, toxic fog, blocking out the sun while poisoning their lungs! And Counselor calls it harmless?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
His back turned momentarily to the JUDGE, Andrew mouths to Jamey: "Not bad." But he whips around, serious again:
</DIRECTION>
<ANDREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your Honor, Counselor is attempting to portray my client as a hideous manifestation of evil and corruption. But nothing could be further from the truth. Rockwell has generously contributed ten thousand dollars to this neighborhood's schools, clinics and youth centers! Granting a restraining order on the construction site will throw hundreds of Philadelphians out of work, and will lend validation to this contemptible and groundless nuisance suit, which speaks directly to the kind of greed and treachery that today is threatening the very fabric of our society.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDREW>
<DIRECTION>
Judge Tate looks skeptically at both lawyers.

There's a PERSISTENT BEEPING, Andrew and Joe pull out their portable telephones at the same time.

They look at each other: which phone is ringing?

<DIRECTION>
CAMERA FINDS ANDREW sitting quietly, with an IV drip running into his arm. Andrew is wearing a Walkman, the source of the CLASSICAL MUSIC, and he's reading a legal brief. Most of the people in the room look SICKER than Andrew.

Wheeler, Kenton and Seidman proceed with the male ritual of preparing cigars to be smoked: snipping the ends with a brass clip, rolling them over their tongues to wet them, sliding the cigars in and out of their rounded mouths.

Andrew, holding a cigar but NOT preparing to light it, watches with a not completely concealed twinkle in his eye.

	Two. How many toilet stalls are there in the men's room? Two, plus four urinals. How many wheelchair accessible toilets in either of those restrooms? Zero. In this entire building? Zero. Get the picture, Filko? Discrimination! You find yourself a female, paraplegic, legal assistant who is qualified to work here, except she can't take a leak... and you've got yourself a sex discrimination suit and a handicapped discrimination suit. Not handicapped. What do you call someone who can't use a normal restroom? "Gastro-intestinally challenged!"

<JUDGE_GARNETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine. I've asked the litigants to be present for this conference, in the hope we can settle this matter today, among ourselves... There is nothing I hate more, than to see lawyers suing each other. If you look at the opinion polls, when Mr. John Q. Citizen is asked to rank professions according to the respect he holds for them... Where are the lawyers? Somewhere below personal fitness trainers and only slightly above child pornographers. If we keep suing each other, if we fail to settle the smallest difference among ourselves with mutual respect, if we continue to scrap like bucks in heat, we'll fall lower on that list. And when people lose respect for lawyers, they lose respect for the law. And when this society loses all respect for the law, we'll be murdered in our beds, my friends, our cherished institutions will be burned to the ground and our children and our grandchildren will live like savages.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You survived your first gay party intact.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDREW>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me tell you something, okay? When you're brought up, like the rest of us, in a place like where I was brought up, there's not a whole lot of discussion about... homosexuals. As a kid, you're taught right away that queers are weird, queers are funny, they're a danger to kids, they're afraid to fight, and they all want to cop your joint. And that pretty much sums up the general thinking out there, if you want to know the truth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<ANDREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you for sharing that with me, Joe.

</ANDREW>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We proceed, representing your estate.

</JOE>
<ANDREW>

	I've made provisions in my will for some charities. Miguel will need a lawyer. I know it's not your area...

	That's right.

	Absolutely.

</DIRECTION>
<BELINDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why did you recruit Andrew Beckett to your firm?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELINDA>
<DIRECTION>
Andrew uses all his strength to concentrate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Charles Wheeler speaks with great sincerity.
</DIRECTION>
<WHEELER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you're the owner of a major league ball club, you recruit the hot rookie. And Andy was tremendously promising as a young attorney. That's why we went after him, that's why we hired him, and that's why we stuck with him, year after year... waiting for the promise to be fulfilled. But it never was.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHEELER>
<BELINDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You kept giving him another chance?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELINDA>
<WHEELER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course we did. When you've groomed someone they way we groomed Andy, nurturing him, lavishing all kinds of special treatment on him... you've made quite an investment. We were waiting for his promise to kick in, and deliver. But, ultimately, we could no longer ignore the gap between the promise and the reality... This is one of the saddest times in my life. To sit in this court, testifying to Andy's ultimate failure to make the grade. To discover that he is one of those people who wants to benefit by the system, but doesn't want to play by the system's rules. To think you know someone, only to find out... you don't know them at all. It's heartbreaking.

	Explain to me, if you can, Mr. Wheeler, explain this to me like I'm a ten year-old. This trial is not about a disease, is that what you're saying? Not about your understandable, if unfounded, fear of catching AIDS through casual contact with someone who has it? You're saying, this trial is about Andrew Beckett's character. Am I getting this right?

	Yes, character. To the extent that it affects a person's ability to do a great job.

CAMERA MOVES IN SLOWLY ON HIM:
</DIRECTION>
<MARINE_JUROR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're saying he wasn't a good lawyer. He was mediocre. And the fact that they gave him the most important lawsuit they'd ever had, for one of their most important clients... they say that doesn't prove anything, because that was just a test. What did they call it? A carrot. To see if he'd rise to the occasion... Okay... Say I've got to send a pilot into enemy territory, and he's gonna be flying a plane that cost 350 million dollars... Who am I going to put into that plane? A rookie who can't cut the grade, because I want to see if he'll rise to the challenge? Or am I going to give that assignment to my best pilot, my most experienced, my sharpest, my top gun... The very best I've got?

Joe moves down the corridor, looking for a particular room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dr. Gillman stands outside a hospital room, talking in a low voice to Bud and Sarah Beckett. As Joe passes them, entering Andrew's room, he hears:
</DIRECTION>
<DR_GILLMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>

INT. NIGHT - ANDREW'S HOSPITAL ROOM ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hand-painted banner is strung over Andrew's bed: "Victory."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OPERA MUSIC plays on a portable CD player. ANDREW lies in a hospital bed, with a pressurized oxygen mask on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JILL sits on the edge of Andrew's bed, holding his hand, smiling, speaking to Andrew in low tones. With his free hand, Andrew gently strokes Jill's forearm. (Andrew has an amazing assortment of tubes and IVs running into various parts of his body.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andrew's brothers MATT and RANDY are sipping beers with REV. JIM, MIGUEL, Miguel's sister MARIA, Bruno and Chandra, while Matt does a dramatic re-creation of the Marine Juror rendering the judgment. Matt's audience is loving it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Joe comes into the room, Jill rises to take the shopping bags from him. Joe exchanges nods and greetings with the others.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
People KEEP THEIR VOICES LOW, but there's a certain energy, and happiness evident in the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON ANDREW: Watching his friends and relatives with sparkling eyes and a weak, but grateful and peaceful smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON JOE: Glancing across the room, catching Andrew's look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andrew smiles at Joe and pats his hospital bed, indicating he wants Joe to sit there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe crosses the room, sits on the edge of the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With some difficulty, Andrew removes his oxygen mask. His voice is raspy, weak:
</DIRECTION>
<ANDREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you call a thousand lawyers chained together at the bottom of the ocean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDREW>

RACHEL OPENS THE DOOR OF THE LOFT, FINDING MIGUEL'S FAMILY on the other side: very dignified, handsome people who have just arrived from Spain. They enter the apartment, where...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A wake is in progress. Lots of food. People sharing stories about Andrew. Some people laughing. one or two softly crying as they hug each other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Someone has set up a "memento" table, with pictures of Andrew at various stages of his life, and things that meant something to him, like programs from the opera, a ballcap, photos of his favorite cat, etc.
</DIRECTION>

THEME MUSIC PLAYS, but we hear BITS OF DIALOGUE under the music ("You're Miguel's parents?" "Do you remember when Andy..." "I went to college with Andy..." etc.)
</DIRECTION>

Bud Beckett sits alone, very quiet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel leads his parents over to Bud. Bud looks up, rises, extending his hand to MIGUEL'S DAD. Miguel's father shakes his head in sadness, reaches for Bud and pulls him into his arms for an embrace.

CAMERA MOVES THROUGH THE CROWD, SEEMING TO SEARCH FOR SOMETHING...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA ZEROS IN ON THE TV SET, across the room, where BLACK AND WHITE IMAGES ARE FLICKERING, ignored by everyone...

AS CAMERA GETS CLOSER TO THE TV, it becomes apparent that the images are BLACK AND WHITE HOME MOVIES, converted to video...

THE HOME MOVIES FEATURE a bright-eyed LITTLE BOY...

<DIRECTION>
Andrew...

<DIRECTION>
Riding a bike with training wheels...

Swinging wildly at a wiffle ball...

AS CAMERA TRACKS INTO THE TV, PARTY SOUNDS AND THEME MUSIC FADES... People are still talking, still laughing, still crying, but we CAN'T HEAR THEM ANY LONGER. Instead...
