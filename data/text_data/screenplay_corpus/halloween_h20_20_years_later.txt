<DIRECTION>
SUPER the legend: "Langley, Illinois. October 28th 1998"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
nestled in the middle of a tree-lined street. A Honda Civic pulls into a darkened driveway, the headlights are extinguished...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAMELA WHITTINGTON, a middle-aged woman in full registered nurse attire, emerges from the parked car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An unlit cigarette dangles loosely from her lips. She heads to the porch, digging through her purse in search of a light...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CRUNCH!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pamela stops in her tracks, looks down at her feet to discover
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GLASS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
scattered across the porch. She looks at the porch light hanging above her head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SHATTERED LIGHT BULB occupies the socket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pamela turns her attention to the front door... it's slightly ajar. She pushes on it gently.... the door swings open freely, revealing the darkened interior.
</DIRECTION>
<PAMELA>

	Shit...

</PAMELA>
<DIRECTION>
Pamela drops her purse... darts across some hedges into the neighbor's yard...

EXT. THE HOUSE NEXT DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pamela runs up to the porch, decorated with carved pumpkins... POUNDS furiously on the front door, decorated with a CARDBOARD SKELETON.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NO ANSWER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She POUNDS again... HARDER. Suddenly, the door SWINGS open to reveal
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AN OMINOUS FIGURE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
looming in the doorway. A HOCKEY MASK cloaks his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A PAIR OF EYES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
glare at Pamela from behind the cut-outs in the plastic vizard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAMELA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
gasps, stumbles backward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FIGURE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
flips up his mask to reveal
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JIMMY HOWELL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
a gangly teen, wearing a hockey jersey... skates slung over his shoulder.

<DIRECTION>
JIMMY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
moves toward the front door, stepping on pieces of shattered light bulb beneath him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He swings open the front door with the tip of his stick... looks inside the darkened house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He enters cautiously, stick at the ready.

PAMELA

</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
He moves stealthily through the house, hockey stick poised high in the air... room-by-room he checks for intruders...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy finds his way to the rear of the home, crosses to a back bedroom, stands in the doorway...

	Oh, shit...

ON THE BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Converted to a home office... ransacked... file cabinets overturned, pictures hang crooked on the walls, papers carpet the floor...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JIMMY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
drops the stick to his side, convinced he is now alone in the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He crosses back into the kitchen... steals a cookie from a cookie jar... opens the fridge... takes a swig from an open milk carton... completely unaware that --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BEDROOM CLOSET DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is opening slowly behind him, then suddenly --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CRASH!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An IRONING BOARD topples out from inside, slams against his back, hard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JIMMY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
snaps the hockey stick into position... spins around... swings wildly with the wooden baton. He makes contact with...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A POT RACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
suspended above the island... pots dangling from their hooks come clanging down on top of him...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dust settles... Jimmy realizes he's been beating the stuffing out of an ironing board. He sheepishly exits the kitchen...

INT. HOUSE

Pamela enters the house, LOCKS AND BOLTS the front door behind her. She breathes a heavy sigh of relief, back against the door... she flicks on a light switch... NOTHING.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Christ, Jimmy... didn't you try the goddamn lights?!

Pamela moves down the hallway to the laundry room... she opens the door to the FUSE BOX... toggles some fuses on and off... tries the laundry room light... still NOTHING, darkness.

The converted bedroom in complete disarray... Pamela navigates through the wreckage, carving a path with the beam of her flashlight. She approaches --

A DESK

completely bare except for a single FILE FOLDER resting on its top.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAMELA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
shines the beam on the lone file folder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON the folder... the index tab reads "KERI TATE." Pamela opens the folder, it's EMPTY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAMELA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
gasps, the blood rushes from her face. She immediately rushes for the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLANK!

A noise is heard. She's not alone in this house. She moves through the hallway to discover the front door wide open. Shit. She bolts.

Pamela runs out the door and back to Jimmy's house. She opens the front door, disappears inside.

Pamela shuts the door behind her... cranes her neck, searching for any signs of Jimmy --

She HEARS the sounds of a television emanating from deep within the house.

JIMMY

seated in an easy-chair, watching an episode of "SEINFELD." his back to Pamela... only his legs are visible from her point-of-view.

Pamela approaches him --

<PAMELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goddamnit, Jimmy! Someone's still in my house!

</PAMELA>
<DIRECTION>
Pamela spins the easy-chair around to reveal --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HOCKEY SKATE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
embedded deep into Jimmy's face... the blade slicing through flesh, from forehead to chin... eyes wide open in terror... blood cascades down his jersey...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAMELA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
screams... bolts through the house, reaches the front door to find --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CHINA CABINET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
pushed in front of it, blocks her way! She tries fiercely to move the wooden hutch, but can't...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pamela runs back through the house, frantic... in desperate search of an exit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She crosses into the kitchen, spots her escape... moves to the rear door, opens it to reveal...

<DIRECTION>
THE SHAPE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
standing, poised, evil eyes burning through slits in his trademark mask.

PAMELA

A squad car arrives in front of Pamela's house. Two UNIFORMED COPS emerge from the vehicle, head up her driveway.

Struggles to open the window... she can't manage to disengage the lock... she pounds feverishly on the glass --

PAMELA

spins around, swings at the Shape with the knife...
</DIRECTION>
<PAMELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay the fuck away from me!

</PAMELA>
<DIRECTION>
The Shape swings the iron poker... delivers a severe blow to Pamela's arm... breaks it... the knife falls to the floor below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pamela howls in pain... drops to her knees, nurses her arm...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Shape raises the poker high into the air, comes down hard... drives the tip of the poker through her skull... CRACK!

EXT. PAMELA'S FRONT PORCH - SAME TIME

BLAKE

crosses to Carter, extends a dixie cup in his direction --
</DIRECTION>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No thanks, I'm not thirsty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<BLAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's for your cigarette. I prefer not to contaminate my crime scene with micropollutants.
	</DIALOGUE>

Carter takes a final puff off the cigarette, drops it into the cup...
</DIRECTION>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why am I here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<BLAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They said on the phone you were assigned to the Meyers case.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLAKE>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With all due respect, detective, you can't go blaming every brutal murder in Illinois on Michael Meyers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<BLAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pamela Whittington was a long time associate of Dr. Loomis. Her home office was ransacked. It was chock full of Loomis' files on Meyers. It'd say that makes Meyers a suspect, wouldn't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLAKE>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, when you put it that way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<BLAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. So why don't we get on with this investigation?

During the following dialogue, Blake walks Carter through the crime scene reenacting the prior evening's brutal events...

	Pamela entered the house and walked into the den where she discovers James Howell's body...

Carter and Blake stand in front of the mutilated face of the teenage boy...

<BLAKE>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)

	She runs to the kitchen, where she is ambushed at the back door by the killer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLAKE>

Carter and Blake stand in front of the door, which is still open. Carter kneels down, looks at the kitchen floor...
</DIRECTION>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One set of muddy shoe prints.

</CARTER>
<BLAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That don't match either of the victim's.

</BLAKE>
<DIRECTION>
Carter stands up, moves to a butcher block on the counter... he's starting to enjoy this dance --
</DIRECTION>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She grabs a knife from the butcher block.

</CARTER>

They cross back into the living room...

Carter moves to the

<DIRECTION>
WINDOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
covered in fingerprint powder, exposing a plethora of prints.
</DIRECTION>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where, judging by the looks of the finger and palm prints, she struggles to open the window before banging on it like hell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<BLAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Unable to escape, she turns and attacks the killer, but doesn't connect.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLAKE>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No blood on the knife.

<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As which point she drops to her knees in pain...

</CARTER>
<BLAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Explaining the low height of the blood splatter on the curtains...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLAKE>

ON the curtains, blood stained four feet and below...

CLOSE ON: THE GLOBE

A headline reads: "SERIAL KILLER MICHAEL MEYERS REALLY ALIEN FROM OUTER SPACE." Beneath the headline is a mock photo of the Shape, holding the infamous mask in his hand, revealing an alien head underneath....

THE SHAPE

KERI'S

Of a young Michael Meyers playing with a fire truck in the den... running through sprinklers in the backyard... riding horses at the county fair... no signs of the evil lurking inside.

CARTER sets the photographs aside, digs through a file box... pulls out a film canister marked "MEYERS' HOME MOVIES."
</DIRECTION>

CARTER threads the Super 8 film through it, turns it on... images of a young Michael Meyers are projected on a bare wall in the darkened room.

CARTER settles into the recliner, fights to stay awake...

THE SHAPE APPEARS IN FRONT OF THE WALL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The home movies projected on his pale mask. He moves slowly toward the sleeping CARTER, a knife in his grip.

The SHAPE raises the knife to CARTER's throat, slices it from ear to ear. CARTER grabs his throat, blood gushes through his fingers. Then...

Hattie crosses to the right entrance, shuts the door... locks it. Now secured safely inside the guard house, Hattie crosses to a CB Radio...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns it on... dials the emergency channel... is distracted by --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
outside the gates... its headlights suddenly extinguish.

<DIRECTION>
ON Hattie, squints through through window in the car's direction...

<DIRECTION>
THE SHAPE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
emerges from the shadows behind her... wraps the CB cord around her neck... Hattie struggles to free herself... her face pressed up against the glass...

Wally, the custodian, climbs the four flights of stairs to the massive bell partially enclosed at its top... he tugs on the rope dangling from the bell...

THE BELL RINGS.

<DIRECTION>
Its sound resonating across the campus.

The windows, once lit, are now extinguished, leaving the dorms shrouded in total darkness... lights out.

The sound of the ringing bell echoes softly through the room...

Molly lies in her bed, unable to sleep, eyes to the ceiling... her pajama clad body partially covered by a sheet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON "LURCH," THE SCHOOL DOG
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
lying beside Molly's bed, also asleep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Molly hears the RUSTLING of bushes outside her window... she turns in its direction to see --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BUSHES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
moving forcefully, their branches scratching wildly against glass...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOLLY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
sits up in bed, her eyes glued to the window... she slowly gets out of bed, moves toward it... leans against the windowpane.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE THROUGH THE WINDOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
of the campus, bathed in moonlight... wind howls through the trees... leaves scurry across the grounds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BANG! BANG!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hand raps on her window. Molly jumps out of her skin.

She dives into the water... swims underwater toward the shallow end... she heads toward the surface...

SARAH POV

The SHAPE is standing poolside... his image warped by the rolling water, bobbing and swaying with the current.

Sarah breaks through the surface of the water, catches her breath... throws off her goggles, scans the gym...

Empty. Not a soul in sight.

Pushes her back into the pool... holds her head under the water... her arms flail wildly as she struggles for breath...

Sarah's body goes limp... the SHAPE releases her... her lifeless body floats face down in the bloody water.

Freshman, armed with cartons of eggs and rolls of toilet paper, emerge stealthily from the wooded acreage... they attack the Hillcrest Administrative Building.

ANGLE THROUGH THE WINDOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the top of the bell tower... the SHAPE stands beside the massive bell... staring in Molly's direction, looking right through her.

Molly gasps softly. She looks down below and sees...

LINDA

liplocked, hands all over each other. Linda sits on the edge of a table.

Shane, dressed as a condom, stands between her legs.

watches from the kitchen, illuminated only by the light from a nearby soda machine.

She stands back up... shrugs it off... moves to the next stall and goes inside, closing the door behind her.

TIGHT ON DOOR

The toilet flushes. Linda emerges from the stall, crosses to the mirror... checks her make-up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON THE MIRROR

Linda admires her reflection... not noticing the stall door which was previously locked is now opened.

Linda moves into the kitchen area where...

<DIRECTION>
THE SHAPE

<DIRECTION>
emerges from the shadows, attacks Linda... grabs her by the throat, lifts her into the air...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her head hits the pot rack hanging above her... pots and pans drop to the tile floor below...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Linda flails her arms and legs, desperately trying to free herself form the SHAPE'S grasp...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She kicks the refrigerator door behind her... it swings open to reveal...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHANE'S BODY STUFFED INSIDE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Asphyxiated, his condom hat pulled down over his head... his corpse topples out of her refrigerator, falls onto the floor...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SHAPE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
flicks the switch on a nearby MEAT SLICER, it WHIRS to life.

Wall-to-wall clothes hang from wooden dowels... Molly palms the lightswitch, flicks off the light.

The misfits who tee-pee'd the school have returned, this time with black duffel bags in tow.

ON THE REAR DOUBLE DOORS

Another freshman sneaks into the gymnasium, while a fellow SCHOOLMATE hide behind some bushes... on the lookout for Wally.

Molly returns from the bathroom, passes...

Molly climbs into bed, turns on her side... she reaches over to the side of the bed... pets the dog.

	Guess there's always next year... if I live past the humiliation of tonight.

<DIRECTION>
LURCH!

The dog enters the room, sits in the doorway... growls in her direction.

ON Molly. Shit! She instantly stops petting whatever is under the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON HER EYES
</DIRECTION>

full of confusion, flushes with fear.

Terrified, she slowly leans over the edge of the bed... comes eye-to-eye with --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SHAPE!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beneath her bed, staring right at her... she was petting the hair on his mask all along.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Molly SCREAMS. The SHAPE grabs her arm, drags her off the bed onto the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Molly struggles with him, as he tries to climb on top of her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SHAPE maintains a strong grip on her ankle with one hand, swings a knife fiercely at her with the other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He makes contact, slices open her left thigh...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Molly SCREAMS in agony, kicks her legs wildly... she manages to strike a hard blow to his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She breaks free of his grip, takes off limping down the hall... her hand pressed against the gaping wound carved in her thigh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON THE HALL

<DIRECTION>
Seems to stretch for miles...

Molly limps down the corridor, dragging her leg behind her... she looks behind her... no sign for the SHAPE... yet.

passes by... she lets out a silent sigh of relief, when suddenly...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SHAPE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
steps back into the doorway, looks into the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Molly freezes, looks at the wall beside her, she sees...

<DIRECTION>
projected on the wall, it betrays her.

Molly grabs the door... pulls it towards her, smashing the SHAPE'S arm between the door and the jam. He releases her...

She flies out of the room, down the hall... stumbles down a flight of stairs... dashes out of the dormitory.

"CAUTION: BE SURE TO CLEAR GYM AND/OR POOL BEFORE OPERATING FLOOR"

Hung above a large red button. THE CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL the freshman, who snuck in earlier, poised beneath it...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He punches the button, then pops it off and puts it in his pocket... he darts for the front entrance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLANG-CLANG-CLANG!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The gymnasium floor begins to move beneath the students' feet, splits right down the middle... retracts into the walls...

The students part like the Red Sea, hooting and hollering as the pool beneath them is revealed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GYMNASIUM

The freshman flies out of the gym, slams the doors shut behind him... his schoolmate chains the doors, locks them with a padlock. They dart for the woods, passing...

MOLLY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stumbles towards them, her pants bloodied. She SCREAMS, tries to get their attention... they disappear into the thicket.

She moves to the rear of the gymnasium, bangs on the chained doors... SCREAMS for help, looks over her shoulder to see...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

SARAH

floating, face down in the pool... water tainted bright red with her blood, illuminated by the pool light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The mood suddenly changes... the SCREAMS of excitement quickly turn into SHRIEKS of horror. Bedlam ensues...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frightened students scramble toward the entrance, knocking party goers into the pool... trampling over others.

MOLLY'S SCREAMS

from outside her office. Keri crosses to the window...

Molly bursts through the door... she stops at the bottom of the staircase, looks up to see...

FOUR FLIGHTS OF STAIRS

As she makes her ascent, she looks down to see...

<DIRECTION>
to swing... BUT there is no sound!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Molly frantically pulls the rope again, SCREAMING madly... trying desperately to get someone's attention...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Still no sound! She moves to the gargantuan bell, looks inside and sees...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WALLY'S BODY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stuffed up inside of it, preventing the clapper from striking the bell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Molly reaches in, grabs Wally's shirt... tugs with all her might... expels the cadaver with a final heave-ho.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON Wally's corpse as it falls four stories down, lands at the foot of the staircase.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Molly stumbles back... wraps the rope around her wrists, tugs with all her weight...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RING-RING-RING! THE BELL RESONATES ACROSS CAMPUS. A call for help...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Molly continues to pull at the rope, her wrists bleeding as the cord digs into her skin. She watches in horror as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SHADOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
approaches the top of the stairway... a FIGURE emerges, it's...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SHAPE
</DIRECTION>

Molly SCREAMS... the SHAPE grabs he... wraps the ROPE tightly around her neck... Molly grasp for breath.

WILL

his whole upper torso shoved into the oven, clothes ablaze.

KERI

Keri slowly turns around to see --

THE SHAPE

standing above her, comes down on her with a knife... makes contact, slices her shoulder wide open.

KERI

scrambles to her feet, grabs a pot off the stove... swings at the SHAPE.

Hattie's body falls from the drop-ceiling above, lands right on top of Keri. Shit. Keri throws the bloody corpse off of her.

She looks around the room... zeroes in on the large CB RADIO... she picks it up and SMASHES it against the console... over and over again... sparks fly... the gate now permanently closed.
