Little Geek is an underwater robot which operated on the end of a cable-like control TETHER. It has a single video 'eye' in front, by which the operator pilots the little machine.

She casually toes open one of the latches, then the other. Glances at Coffey. He's reading. She begins to lift the lid with her toe.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs the safety line and pulls twice. Hard. It is snagged on a sharp metal edge ten feet from him. He pulls twice more, harder, hauling the thing. The line severs. Jammer stared at the frayed and floating toward him. His eyes bug. He looks all around in the darkness. Can't see Bud. Can't decide what to do. We can see hysteria revving up inside him like a flywheel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he becomes aware of a faint radiance flickering over the walls. It is a cold and ethereal light, unlike the warm-white of their dive lights.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It grows brighter. He turns slowly toward it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The glow is moving beneath the steel grill of the deck, sending shafts of cold light flickering upward hypnotically, coming toward him.

<JAMMER>

</JAMMER>
<DIRECTION>
C.U. JAMMER, shielding his eyes, staring into the radiant source.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Guess what, Jammer? It's not Bud. In the brightest center of the glow, SOMETHING is moving, a figure casting strange inhuman shadow across the walls. Jammer blinks against the glare, his face registering total, outright astonishment melting into terror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The glare pulses subtly, hypnotically. The shifting shadow falls across Jammer. He finally snaps out of his fixity...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Screaming and gulping air he spins away and starts clawing hand over hand through the treacherous wreckage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His harness catches on a twisted pipe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He struggles, totally out of control... the big man reduced to a blind panic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jammer heaves forward with all his adrenalized strength.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He tears free of the entangling debris. Launches like a torpedo... slamming his backpack full force into the top sill of the hatchway. His tri-mix regulator takes the full brunt of the impact.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON BUD, swimming furiously back toward Jammer's position. The strange radiance is gone. His dive light flare back to full brightness.

<BUD>

<DIRECTION>
Lindsey is approaching the monolith of the sail, maneuvering to clear the horizontal diving plane. Then her lights go dim and her thrusters loose power.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly a bright corona breaks around the bulk of the sail and SOMETHING appears right in front of her, a glowing object moving like a bat out of hell right at her! It is slightly smaller than submersible and we only get a glimpse. What we think we see in the diffuse glow is a translucent ovoid, open at the front with a spinning vortex of light inside... like some hallucinatory jet engine. And it's hauling ass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lindsey jinks left. The object jogs right. She fights the control as her sub slews around, slamming broadside into the sail. K-BAM! Her power comes back up. Righting Can One, she spins to look through the aft viewport in time to see the object racing away in a broad arc. It pulls a high-G turn and dives straight down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see the object zip behind Flatbed. One Night can't see it. The thing spirals down into the darkness like a hit-and-run drunk, diving along the wall into the abyss until it is lost to view.

The winch man staggers along the railing, blasted by 80-knot winds. He sprints for the base of the enormous crane which supports the umbilical winch. A wave blasts him into the bulkhead. He half-crawls to the ladder going up to the winch-house. As he climbs the winch's heave-compensator slides up and down, FILLING FRAME behind him.

It is bottoming-out with a sound like a piledriver, overloaded by the strain on the cable. It chooses that moment to fail. GRINDING CRASH OF METAL.

K-WHAM!! The 40-ton crane hits like a flatiron thirty feet in front of them. A clean miss. Much WHOOPING AND CHEERING. Then...

The crane topples slowly over the back. It rolls down the slope of the drop- off, gathering speed. Then tumbles over the cliff into the abyssal canyon. The coiled umbilical starts to pay out after it like rope after a harpoon. And they're still attached.

IN THE LADDERWELL of trimodule C, Lindsey runs toward the machine rooms. K-BOOM! A searing bright EXPLOSION in the electrical room. Flames roar through the doorway.

Hippy runs in. The place is going nuts. Water floods from the moonpool as the rig tilts. Wilhite is dancing across the deck, leaping over compressed- gas cylinders which are rolling around loose. Cab One jumps clear off its cradle and slides SCREECHING across the deck. Wilhite, running before the 12-tom juggernaut, had no place to go. The SEAL dives into the churning moonpool. Cab One slams into the end wall, then spins and rolls toward Hippy.

He starts to run. Drop something. Looks back.

Beany, in his zip-loc bag, is lying in the path of the slide submersible. Hippy runs back. Scoops up the baggie. Cab One FILLS FRAME behind him. He makes it through the door an instant before the thing hits behind him, buckling the steel doorframe.

Wilhite is clawing up the sheep skirting of the moonpool. He gets his fingers over the top. Pulls himself up...

Bud comes pounding down the flooding corridor in time to see the water in the drill room swirl above the pressure window, obscuring the faces of the trapped men. He claws futility at the door. The motors and the fail-safe latching mechanism are on the opposite side. Through the pressure window he watches helplessly as they drown. We don't see what he sees, but we know what he sees. Suddenly the bulkhead next to him gives way and a freezing torrent thunders in. Bud is blown off his feet a hurled along the corridor.

He scramble up somehow, splashing waist deep toward the opposite end of the corridor where another of the hydraulic doors is closing inexorably. He's not going to make it. He reaches it a moment too late to squeeze through. Grabs the edge of the door and desperately tries to stop it from closing with the strength of this arms. It doesn't work. The steel door closes on the fingers of his left hand, pinning them in the doorframe.

But something amazing happens. His wedding ring lodges between the door and frame, preventing his fingers from being crushed and the door from sealing and locking.

Lindsey stand before it, unable to move. Absolutely rapt.

The lights are down. Those who can are grabbing some sleep. Snoring comes from one of the bunkrooms as Lindsey passes. In the mess hall, Catfish and Bud are crashed out on the tables, wrapped in blankets. The cold has gotten intense. Water drips. The walls sweat with condensation. Lindsey can see her breath as she makes coffee. She carries a cup over to Monk, who is a face in a pile of blankets. A hand comes out, takes the coffee.

He yawns as he shambles across the chamber to the corridor door. Switches off the lights. Goes out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quiet lapping of water in the moonpool. A beat. Then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A cold luminosity suffuses the water beneath the moonpool opening, sending shadows shifting across the top of the chamber. The surface begins to pulsate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the water itself rises, forming itself into a shifting, shimmering pseudopod as big around as a man's body. The transparent form pulses... an amoebic mass shivering in the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It stretches, becoming a more refined form. Like a blindly probing glass python, it elongates and weaves across the room. It extends and extends, stretching out from the moonpool, a shimmering tentacle. The 'head' or tip, a featureless liquid bulb, seems somehow to be scanning as it moves forward, as if it can see where it's going.

Hippy trudges along the dark corridor. He reaches the men's head and goes in. As the door closes, the tip of the liquid pseudopod extends into the corridor B.G. It 'looks' left and right. Then extends the length of the corridor, holding itself a couple feet off the floor like a weightless snake.

FROM INSIDE THE MAKESHIFT BUNKROOM, we see its tip extend inside.
</DIRECTION>

Sonny and One Night are snoring, oblivious. Jammer is still unconscious. The pseudopod, taking its time, checks them out and then moves on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE MESS HALL, it's dark and quiet. Lindsey has even fallen asleep in her chair, her head buried in her arms on the table. The shimmering tentacle enters the room in total silence. It sways gracefully in to air, searching. It undulates across the room, hanging about five feet in the air, surveying everything. It moves past Lindsey. Sensing something, she lifts her head, turning... sees the apparition next to her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her eyes go wide. Amazement, but not fear. The tentacle is moving on, still searching. Lindsey shakes Bud awake, clapping her hand over his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud blinks twice, then freezes. When she lowers her hand his mouth is hanging open like a total goon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud chucks his pillow are Catfish, on the next table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Catfish cracks one eye open. Turns away. Turns right back... both eyes open now. Sensing movement, the thing turn back toward them. It seems to recognize Lindsey. It doubles back on itself in a loop and comes right up to her. She holds her ground, fascinated.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bulbous tip forms suddenly into a human face... her face. It is water, still clear and undulating... but definitely Lindsey. She gasps in surprise. The liquid-Lindsey gasps soundlessly... a perfect mimic of her expression. Lindsey laughs involuntarily. It laughs... without sound. Lindsey makes a face, sticking out her tongue... testing it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The liquid-Lindsey does the same. Bud has just had the rug jerked out from under his sense of what is possible and what isn't, but he's taking it pretty will, considering.

Her liquid face suddenly transforms into a likeness of Bud's.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches out her hand slowly. Gingerly, her fingers touch the surface. Ripples extend outward from the contact, across Bud's features.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her fingertips break effortlessly through the surface, just like she's dipping her hand into a bowl of water, except sideways. She draws her wet fingers out and studies them, amazed. Touches one fingertip to her tongue.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Seawater.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDSEY>

The pseudopod pulls back from her. It loops in the air dramatically, full circle... and ties itself into a knot. As the knot tightens down, it melts back into the body. The 'disappearing knot' trick.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lindsey laughs, grinning with the open wonder and delight of a child at a magic show. She is transported.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Show off.

</DIRECTION>

Coffey and Schoenick enter the back way, through the dive-prep area. They see the pseudopod arching from the moonpool big as a treetrunk. Coffey's mind is blown. We can smell the insulation burning. He just stares.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. CORRIDOR/MAINTENANCE ROOM B
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The water tentacle enters and moves toward the hot-wired warhead. It studies the device for a few seconds. Bud and Lindsey enter through a side door, in time to see the tentacle divide into four tendrils which wrap around the warhead. They begin to lift it off its cart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. SUB BAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coffey finally jump-starts his brain. In a flash of insight, he runs to the big sliding door through which the pseudopod stretches into the corridor. He and Schoenick heave on the door. Like a guillotine blade it slices effortlessly through it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VARIOUS ANGLES -- CORRIDORS, MESS HALL, LADDERWELL, MAINTENANCE... as the body of the pseudopod collapses, splashing on the floor. It reverts to nothing more than a long puddle of simple seawater. As the tendrils dissolve, the warhead slams back down onto the cart, unharmed. ON COFFEY'S SIDE ON THE DOOR, however, the "stump" rears back like a cobra. It withdraws rapidly into the moonpool. The glow fades away.

Outside the mess hall, Coffey pauses, listening to the conversation resume. Bright speculation, a few jokes. Coffey is visible shaking. Breathing hard. Pupils dilated. Schoenick looks at him with concern.

The door opens in the dark room. Coffey enters, moving with purpose. He pulls his gear bag out from under the work table. Unzips it. Pulls out a short-barreled CAR-15 assault rifle.

<DIRECTION>
Hippy freezes in the corridor as he hears a loud ratcheting sound echoing from the sub-bay. He edges forward slowly, trying to keep his feet silent on the steel floor. Slides up along the wall next to the door. Inches his eye around the doorframe. Across the room. Schoenick is working with a chainfall, lowering Big Geek onto the MIRV warhead, which is still on its cart. He begins to attach them together with a sling of tie-down straps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hippy lets his breath out slowly. His expression is Holy Shit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He slides back along the corridor wall, silently. Away from the door. Then turn turns quickly to go... WHAM! Coffey slams him up against the wall! .45 pressed to Hippy's temple. Hippy gulping air as Coffey ears back the hammer.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The meeting is breaking up as the door CLANGS open and Hippy is thrusted inside. His hands are taped behind his back and he stumbles onto his face. Coffey steps through smoothly, straight-arming the .45. Schoenick flanks him with the assault rifle aimed at the group.

He hands his gun to Monk, with the assumption of absolute loyalty from a team member. Monk's eyes move between Coffey and the pistol. We can't tell what he's thinking. Coffey grabs Hippy and shoves him onto a chair.

Coffey lets her approach him, his eyes glittering.
</DIRECTION>

Without warning he grabs her by the hair and hurls her against the Coke machine, pinning her there with one hand. Bud leaps forward.

His hand reaches down, OUT OF FRAME. We hear something RIP. His hand comes back up... holding a piece of gaffer's tape.

Their only hope is to sway Schoenick. But the SEAL's fear is making him the perfect machine, totally dependent on external orders. And his orders are clear. They can see him through the tiny window in the door. Lindsey rips the tape painfully off her mouth.

They're locked in trimodule-C. No other doors give access to the sub-bay corridor. Bud's mind is racing. He drops down the ladder to Level One, into about two feet of water. He reaches down and open the emergency lockout hatch. Takes off his boots.

Bed shoots down through the hatch. The cold hits him list a fist, becoming instantly paralyzing.

In the moonpool, Bud surface with an explosive gasp beside the full of Flatbed. His wracked breathing is masked by the WHINE of HYDRAULICS as Coffey uses the external controls to extend Flatbed's big hydraulic arm, locking the Geek/MIRV in its gripper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud strokes to a point where Coffey can't see him and heaves up out of the water onto the deck of the pool. He lies gasping behind Cab One's cradle. His limbs are wooden and unresponsive from the cold. His fingers are completely numb. He hugs himself, putting his hands under his armpits. Scans the situation. He can't get to the door, which is across the room, without Coffey seeing him.

<DIRECTION>
Grappling, they fall together into the freezing water.

Coffey is momentarily stunned by the cold, giving Bud time to haul himself out, hoping to make it to the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coffey launches from the water and grabs him legs.

He pulls himself up as Bud kick out. Claws his way viciously over Bud's body until he has him pinned to the deck. Then he pulls out the .45.

Even so Bud is getting his ass kicked. Coffey's really trying to put him out of business. It's mostly duck and dodges on Bud's part. Throw a few things. When Coffey connects, Bud goes down hard. Give him credit, though. He manages to scramble back up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fight wrecks the room, scattering tools and gear.

Compressed air cylinders roll dangerously around the floor.

Coffey slips on one and Buds get in a couple of good licks.

<DIRECTION>
Slams the SEAL's head in an equipment locker door.

But the Navy man is just too massive. Bud is hammered back into a wall. Coffey has his fist cocked back for the coup de grace. Spins around at the sound of a VOICE.
</DIRECTION>
<CATFISH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATFISH>
<DIRECTION>
Catfish is right behind him. Dripping wet. A trail of water goes back to the moonpool a few feet away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CRACK! Catfish's 'Hammer' punch comes in so hard and so fast, Coffey is knocked right on his ass. He doesn't get up. Just sort of flops around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Catfish helps Bud to his feet. They advance on Coffey, who crab-scuttles sideways, his eyes rabid.

He picks up a helium tank and hurls it at them. As they duck he sprints to Flatbed and drops through the hatch and slams it down.

Catfish pounds down the corridor like he's never run before, his beer gut doing a rumba. He reaches the door, tears out the piece of pipe and spins the wheel. Hippy pushes it open so fast it hits Catfish in the stomach. Hippy tears past him, running with the assault rifle. John Wayne.

Flatbed is submerging, with only the hatch tower still above the water. Bud is being dragged down, still trying to free the ROV. He gives up when he sees Hippy run in, waving the assault rifle around like a 130-pound Rambo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud climbs the hatch tower and leaps to the deck of the moonpool.

Hippy clumsily raises the unfamiliar rifle at Coffey, visible inside his viewing bubble beneath the swirling water. Coffey looks up, stares at the gun... doesn't seem to care.

He grabs it out of Hippy's hands and aims it at the sub. He racks the water with a long burst. BENEATH THE SURFACE, the rounds nip nasty contrails through the water. They barely scar the front port.

Bud rockets DOWN INTO FRAME in a column of bubbles. He looks around. Through the lattice of conduit under the rig he can see Flatbed moving forward from its exit point under the stern. Bud see a shortcut under the platform.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He kicks along a lattice a pipes, heaving himself along in frantic hand-over- hand stokes. He reaches for Flatbed's stern as it passes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Misses the last hand-hold... but just manages to seize a tie-down trailing behind it. He is jerked along behind the sub.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud holds on with both hands as he is buffeted in the wake of the powerful thrusters. Flatbed gathers speed, moving out toward the edge of the abyssal wall. The current slams him, spinning him like a fishing lure. He pulls himself forward slowly until he can grip the stern rail of Flatbed's platform.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOW ANGLE, look up the wall. Flatbed appears over the edge and stops. Hovering.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE BACK OF FLATBED. Bud has the break he needs. He scrambles up onto the deck and opens and equipment locker. Nothing in it but one of the yellow nylon safety lines. The big arm begins to unfold, lifting Geek/ROV.
</DIRECTION>

Coffey works intently. His eyes are the cool ice of lethal madness in a face streaked with blood. He brings the ROV into view with the boom arm.

GEEK/ROV had a passenger. Brigman. The diver is holding Geek's skid with one hand, doing something with the other. He turns to look at Coffey.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. FLATBED/DEEPCORE

<DIRECTION>
Coffey releases the ROV with the gripper and makes a grab at Bud with the steel claw. Bud dives. The gripper hits his helmet a glancing blow. Bud kicks away rapidly, letting nylon rope pay out. We see he has managed to tie one end to Geek's skids. Coffey hits the button to activate the ROV, sending an acoustic pulse to Geek's transponder. The little robot, pregnant with its load of death, turns nimbly around and dives out and down toward the void.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coffey pivots his bid machine toward Bud. Bud strokes rapidly to a large jumble of wreckage. He loops the rope around a twisted pipe. Big Geek is hauling ass away from him. The line snap taut an instant later. The ROV strains, like a Rottweiler on a leash... trying to go. The rope is slipping as Bud fights to make a knot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flatbed slews around, thrusters whining. As it banks, it hurls up clouds of sediment from the escarpment face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the front panel we see Coffey jerking on the controls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The big arm extends menacingly. The smaller from manipulators open. An enormous predatory instinct, its lights blaring.

The big machine roars forward. Straight at Bud.

Bud gets his knot partly done. See Flatbed looming.

Glare-lit in its lights, Bud grabs a handlehold and pulls himself downward as Coffey closes the last few feet.

Coffey is slammed hard over the controls, up into the front dome port. He gets back in the seat. Strains to free his machine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. DEEPCORE/BIG GEEK/FLATBED
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud swims clear, diving down at an angle along the wall, hoping to stay in Coffey's blind area. Flatbed backs out of the wreckage in a cloud of debris. It pivots toward Bud. Moves after him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nearby, the ROV is whining mindlessly, trying to please. Trying to GO. DETAIL OF ROPE attached to wreckage, as Bud's knot begins to slip. The nylon line starts to play through the knot slowly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BUD has gotten himself into a bad position. Along the bare rock face of the cliff wall he is naked, nailed in the spotlights like a rabbit in front of a truck. Coffey puts the hammer down, thrust levers all the way forward. Flatbed surges forward, multi-limbed and demonic. There's no cover, side to side, up or down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coffey has him head in his lights. Suddenly a bright glare blasts in, blinding Coffey. He looks up to see Cab One rushing down upon him, full throttle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the last moment LIndsey slams the thrusters full-lock and the submersible slews sideways, slamming its heavy skidplate into Flatbed's cab. Coffey is smashed sideways by the shock. He fights to control his vehicle. Lindsey looks up to see Coffey's sub gun it up over the wall, out of sight. She cruises up over Bud.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDSEY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get in!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDSEY>
<DIRECTION>
Bud gets the lockout hatch open and clambers up into Cab One's belly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT./EXT. CAB ONE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud flops over the lip of the hatch and slams it shut. He ditches his helmet. Lindsey raises her vehicle warily above the wall. Through the front port there is not sign of Coffey.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You owe me one, Virgil.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDSEY>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can we negotiate later? There's Big Geek.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
He points. Through the front port, they can see the ROV still straining at its leash. Lindsey dives toward it, simultaneously working the controls to open her own small manipulator claws.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. DEEPCORE/WALL, ETC.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The last few feet of the rope slip through the knot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Big Geek happily surges forward. It dives gracefully down into the void, trailing the yellow rope like a kite tail.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ONE CAB ONE, Bud and Lindsey through the front port.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go after it! We gotta catch it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
FLATBED DROPS INTO FRAME BEHIND THEM, dwarfing little Cab One. They are slammed viciously as Coffey's submersible hammers into them. She hits full throttle. Coffey floors it after Lindsey, ramming her from behind with his more powerful vehicle. With difficulty Lindsey maintains trim.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She arcs back toward the rig. Flatbed slams her again, for the side. She fights for control.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT./EXT. CAB ONE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud is tossed around, ricocheting off the walls. Lindsey flies with her jaw set. Fighting hard for control. The A-frame of the rig looms before her. She shoots through at full throttle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. DEEPCORE AND OCEAN TERRAIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now the fight is really on. The two subs are dodging between the cylindrical modules at full throttle, slamming into each other and the steel pressure hulls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coffey sideswipes the smaller sub, jamming it sideways. It screeches along the flank of one of the trimodules.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They head out over empty terrain in a flat-out speed run.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lindsey is jinking and dodging as Flatbed, roars along behind her, tearing up the bottom with its powerful backwash. Lindsey carves hard around a rock pinnacle, finding herself running parallel to the edge of the abyssal canyon. Coffey is ramming, hammering from behind, then from side to side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lindsey snarls. He's pissing her off. He shouldn't do that.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ahead, out of the blackness, another outcropping.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lindsey rises, cuts right.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smashes down into Coffey's craft. Timing it just right. He skids catch in the rocks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flatbed slews violently, nosing down. Crushing into the rocky bottom. Pressing the advantage, Lindsey hammers into Flatbed from behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It smashes full force into a second spire, spinning out of control.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tangles together, the subs slide down an embankment toward the edge of the wall. With her one remaining thruster she jerks clear of Flatbed and grounds her crippled sub. Flatbed tumbles over the edge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE DOWN THE WALL as it falls, trailing a cloud of sediment like a comet's tail, down into the unfathomable blackness below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. FLATBED
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside the machine, Coffey is fighting for control.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He has no buoyancy or motors and the craft continues its mad plunge. As the pressure intensifies the hull begins to groan, and steel fitting scream with the enormous load.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A tiny silver fracture shoots partway across the front bubble. Grows. Coffey gives up fighting. Just stares, wide eyed, at his death. A damned soul dropping into the bottomless pit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fracture line arcs rapidly across the dome port.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, a scythe-like curtain of seawater, under tons of pressure, slashes into him. A moment later the bubble implodes, and Coffey disappears in a bloody froth of churning water, air and glass shards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. CANYON WALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flatbed looks like a toy, tumbling away down the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Soon its lights vanish.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. CAB ONE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They're both going to have a lot of bruises...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lindsey is surveying the damage. Water is spraying down on them like a shower, and lights are flickering.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You did okay, back there. I was fairly impressed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDSEY>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not good enough. We still gotta catch Big Geek.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<LINDSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not in this thing.

</LINDSEY>
<DIRECTION>
Lindsey is flipping switches. Nothing works.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You totaled it, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<LINDSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. So sue me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDSEY>
<DIRECTION>
Bud looks down. There's already about a foot of water sloshing around the floor at their feet.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's flooding like a son of the bitch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<LINDSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You noticed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDSEY>
<DIRECTION>
She picks up and hand-mike of the underwater telephone.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Deepcore, Deepcore, this is Cab One, over.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDSEY>
<DIRECTION>
She waits. No response.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Try again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<LINDSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Deepcore, this is Cab One. We need assistance, over. Deepcore, this--
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDSEY>
<DIRECTION>
With a SEARING CRACKLE or arc-light, a power panel shorts out and everything goes black.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, that's that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDSEY>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wonderful.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looking around)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's some light from somewhere...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
A faint illumination, dimmer than moonlight, washes in through the front port. Lindsey scrunches up against the acrylic and scans the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Over there. It's the rig.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDSEY>
<DIRECTION>
A glow, beyond a rock promontory... like the lights of a town just over the hill in the desert.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good hundred yards, I'd say.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<LINDSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They'll come out after us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDSEY>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but it's gonna take them a while to find us. We better get this flooding stopped.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
He picks up his helmet and clicks on the light. Using the thing like a bulky flashlight. The water is really pouring in, spraying them like a shower... almost two feet deep already.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see where it's coming in?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDSEY>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Somewhere behind this panel. Hold this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
She takes the light and he tries to reach the burst weld, which is blocked by a steel switch panel and a bunch of conduit.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't get to it. Have to pull this panel off. You go any tools?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<LINDSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know, look around.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDSEY>
<DIRECTION>
Bud scans the cramped interior, feels around under the water. It's past his knees.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing. Son of a bitch. All I need's a goddamn crescent wrench.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs the panel in both hands and starts torquing on it, trying to wrench it off the wall. Heaves on it repeatedly. Finally stops, panting. He's breathing hard now, and it's not just effort.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Son of a bitch!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<LINDSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Calm down, Bud.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDSEY>
<DIRECTION>
A nervous edge in her voice now. Bud's turning all around, looking around for anything, trying to think fast. Water up to their waists. The sea closing in.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay... okay. We gotta get you out of here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<LINDSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDSEY>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know how!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<LINDSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've only got one suit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDSEY>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know! I know! But we better come up with something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<LINDSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aaargh!! I'm freezing!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDSEY>
<DIRECTION>
She climbs up on the pilots seat, scrunching right up against the ceiling, keeping as much of herself as possible out of the frigid water. She's shaking all over with the cold, and getting drenched from above by water pouring in.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, look, you swim to the rig and come back with another suit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDSEY>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seven, eight minute swim each way... not enough time. Look at this...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(the rate of flooding)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Time I get back you'll be--
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
That stops the conversation for a second. About two feet of airspace left. Bud can't believe what this is coming down to. They both stare at each other for a long moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He makes a decision. Starts pulling off his backpack.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright, put this on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<LINDSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What, you growing gills all of a sudden? You got it on, keep it on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDSEY>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't argue, goddamnit, just--
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<LINDSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No way! Forget it. Not an option.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDSEY>
<DIRECTION>
Bud has his pack off uncoupling it. She keeps fighting his hands, stopping him, hooking it back up. The desperation of the situation fuel the struggle.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lindsey, just put the thing on and shut up--
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<LINDSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	NO!! Now be logical, Bud, you're--
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDSEY>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	FUCK LOGIC!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
They're both right up against the ceiling, water up to their chests. Lindsey's lips are blue and trembling from the cold.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen... will you listen to me for a second!? You're for the suit on and you're a better swimmer than me. Right? So I got a plan...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDSEY>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the plan?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<LINDSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I drown, you tow me back to the rig--
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDSEY>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	WHAT KIND OF PLAN IS THAT!??
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
Lindsey's gut-scared... shaking violently, her eyes wide. But she's keeping it together. Thinking it out. Bud see the bottomless pit opening to take her and he can barely think.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, this water is only a couple degrees above freezing. I drown. I go into deep hypothermia... my blood like icewater. I can maybe be revived after ten, fifteen minutes. You got all the stuff to do it on the rig.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDSEY>
<DIRECTION>
Bud stops moving and looks into her face, inches from him. The water is up to their necks. He knows that, as always, infuriatingly, Lindsey is right.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is insane.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<LINDSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the only way, Bud. Now trust me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDSEY>
<DIRECTION>
She takes a deep breath. Before her nerve fails she busies her hands on his suit, rehooking everything.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, I don't believe this is happening.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
She raise his helmet. Water up to their chins. They lock eyes, inches apart. He can feel her breath on his face... maybe for the last time.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh God, Lins... I--
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<LINDSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me later.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDSEY>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs her head in both hands and pulls her mouth to his. They lock together in a fierce kiss, fueled by passion and terror... the naked realization of love hanging over the abyss of death.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She breaks away at the last possible second and quickly pulls his helmet over his head. Seats is down over the neck ring. Lock the bail-out handle, sealing it. Even with her head press up into the highest point of the ceiling, Lindsey's mouth is barely above water. She give a scared little laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is maybe not such a great plan, is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDSEY>
<DIRECTION>
She is half-paralyzed with the cold, shaking pathetically. Puts her face to the glass of his helmet. Seconds to go.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold me. Hold me, Bud... I'm so scared...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDSEY>
<DIRECTION>
He can't hear her, but he read her lips. They clutch each other desperately. The embrace last while the water rises over her mouth and nose. She starts to choke. Her hands grip his shoulders like claws. She bucks and thrashes. Bud holds her, and a scream tears loose from him, a pure agony of the soul.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	NOOOOO!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
The freezing seawater races into her lungs. Her finger go slack, and her hands float lifelessly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud stares, transfixed, as the last tiny bubble trickles out of Lindsey's open mouth. He kicks himself into gear, fingers frenzied as he spins the wheel of the lockout hatch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:

Bud swims with long, powerful kicks, towing Lindsey. Her arms and legs float as gracefully as seaweed waving in a gentle current. Bud's voice comes in short rasps, breathing hard, but icy with control.

The door crashes open and Jammer thunders in. He picks up the CPR cart, meant to roll on wheels, and carries it out past Hippy, Catfish, and One Night, who are crowding in to get the rest of the equipment. They ransack the place in about ten seconds, grabbing everything they might need and half of everything else.

Jammer and Sonny leap into the freezing water, waist deep on the submerged diving platform. Bud bursts to the surface. Together they haul Lindsey across the platform, out of the water, and onto the deck. Her skin is blue- white, her chest still.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud rips his helmet off in a near-frenzy, like a man possessed, a man with a mission. The others are galvanized by his energy even though they all see Lindsey as dead, a corpse... cold and inert. Water flows from her mouth and nose and her lips are blue, her limbs completely limp. Hippy peels back one eyelid, to find the pupil fixed and dilated.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But when Bud shouts for them to move, they move.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Turn her over!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
They flip his wife's body over. He straddles her, pushing down with both hands in the middle of her back. Seawater gushes from her slack lips. He does it again until the flow stops, then flips her onto her back.

<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, hurry! Gimme the de-fib...

One Night and Catfish are fumbling with the emergency cart equipment. They've all been trained in CPR and use of the gear but that was years ago, and is a friend they're working on. They're all thumbs. Catfish drops the electrodes, picks them up quickly, hands them to Bud...
</DIRECTION>
<CATFISH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here, here, here... no, you got to have bare skin, or it won't...

Bud rips into her clothing, opening her jumpsuit, literally tearing away her T-shirt, revealing her bare chest... bony and still.

<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus. Gimme those, come on. Catfish, move it, man! Come on... come on!

He slaps the things into Lindsey's bare skin, one on the sternum and one on the side of the rib cage.

</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
One Night hits the switch and Lindsey's body convulses. It is a pure muscle reflex, and when it is over, there is not a hint of life. Hippy pushes him back and puts a black rubber oxygen mask over her mouth. He opens the valve on the cylinder and starts pumping the squeeze bag. They start packing electronic blankets around her to fight the intense hypothermia
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do it again, One Night. Zap her again!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
The current hits Lindsey again and her back arches. Bud doesn't wait for a result... he's in his own reality now, driven. He's doing it all at once, somehow, in a senseless frenzy... pumping on her chest with his hands, squeezing the oxygen bag, placing the electrodes.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aw. Christ... come on, baby. Again! Do it again!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
Lindsey's back arches. Her body relaxes, inert.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, One Night... what are you waiting for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
A hush seems to have fallen over the group. They know instinctively that it's over. But Bud can't accept it. He looks at them, beseechingly, like they are somehow intentionally holding out on him. One Night starts to cry, quietly.
</DIRECTION>
<CATFISH>
<DIRECTION>
(gently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bud, it's over, man. It's over.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATFISH>
<DIRECTION>
There is a beat of silence. Bud stares down into Lindsey's half-open, motionless eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON LINDSEY'S EYES, moving in until the pupil FILLS FRAME, a black void.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE, HER POV. SILENCE. A distant, distorted image, we see Bud, One Night, Jammer, Hippy, Catfish, staring down. It is like the circular top of a dark well, their faces shimmering as if through the surface of water. It is as if we are in a well, descending, looking up at a circle of faces growing smaller as we drop away... smaller and smaller, receding until it becomes a point of light in the void, like the fading bright dot at the center of a turned-off TV.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON BUD, rigid, staring. Catfish puts his hand gently on Bud's shoulder. Suddenly Bud tears Catfish's hand away and sets upon Lindsey like a madman, renewing his efforts in spades... totally manic.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! NO! She's not... her heart is strong, she wants to live... can't you see that? Come on, Lins. Come on, baby! Zap her again! Do it... DO IT!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
They do. And Bud works, feverishly. He lock his lips over hers and starts mouth-to-mouth. It is frantic, passionate... the kiss of life.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, breath! Goddamn it, you bitch, you never backed down from anything in life... now fight!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
He slaps her face, hard. Her head lolls. He smacks her the other way.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fight, Goddamnit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
LINDSEY's POV, from the bottom of the great well. The circles of faces and light rockets toward us in the blackness, as we soar upward from the pit. We see Bud yelling, but his voice is distant, windlike.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	FIGHT!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON LINDSEY, still. Then something incredible happens. Something they will never forget as long as they live. Lindsey coughs once, weakly, and her hands clench in a spasm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud see it and his expression becomes beatific.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Lins. You can do it... fight your way back, baby...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
The others look on in wonder as Bud wills this woman back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She starts to cough, weakly at first... then more violently as she draws air into her lungs. Bud crouches over her, rubbing her limbs... trying to re- establish circulation. It is like a difficult birth. Lindsey comes hacking and howling back into the world, wet and naked and fighting for breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud puts the oxygen mask over her face and she draws breath after agonized breath. He pushes her wet hair back from her face with his trembling hands, and watches her breathe. Color is returning to her skin as she lies there, gasping weakly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ONE THE GROUP... Catfish, Hippy, One Night, Jammer, the others... they're all grinning, crying, beaming... gazing at the miracle of her rebirth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON BUD... tears are streaming down his face.

:SC: INT. DEEPCORE/QUARTERS -- LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON LINDSEY, sleeping peacefully. WIDER shows Bud hovering over her, attentive. They are alone in Bud's tiny cubicle. Perhaps twenty minutes have passed. She is completely swaddles in blankets, except for her face, and looks like a waif.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lindsey's eyes flutter and open. The first thing she sees is Bud, bending over her. He can't help himself. The tears break again and roll down his cheeks. She seems terribly fragile, but bright and aware. She smiles, faintly... touches his cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey... big boys don't cry, remember?

</LINDSEY>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, lady.

</BUD>
<LINDSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, tough guy. I guess it worked, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDSEY>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Course is worked. You're never wrong, are you? How d'you feel.

<LINDSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>

:SC: INT. SUB-BAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON BUD'S EYES, as Monk's fingers insert acrylic scleral lenses under his eyelids so he can see in the fluid helmet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER reveals Bud is wearing the SEALs' deep suit. Everybody is grouped around, buckling and zipping. He is hyperventilating with an oxygen mask, part of the procedure for transitioning from air to fluid breathing. Monk, on his stretcher, is presiding. The resident expert. Lindsey is wrapped in a blanket, still looking wan and frail. She doesn't have the strength to resist Bud's will, but she's trying.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Bud, no... not you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDSEY>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who then?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
She looks around at the others. Sees their eyes. The fear. Has her answer. He lowers the helmet over his head. Catfish clamps it down. We see what's driving him... his sense of responsibility for these people, for not being able to prevent this situation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He touches her cheek, one last time. She sees his fingers are trembling. Then he puts on the gloves. Catifsh is strapping a KEYPAD UNIT onto Bud's forearm. Lindsey wants to scream... to stop this madness.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
<DIRECTION>
(muffled)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So I'll hear you, but I can't talk?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<MONK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The fluid prevents your larynx from making sound. It'll feel a little strange.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Warning you now, folks, I'm a lousy typist.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The moment of truth, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
His breathing is shallow and tense. He looks at Lindsey. The eyes of a condemned man. She squeezes his hand. He takes a deep breath.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Let's rock and roll.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
Monk gently cracks a valve on the suit's feed line. The breathing fluid (3M fluorocarbon emulsion FX-80) swirls into the helmet. Bud reflexively raises his chin. The liquid fills toward his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<MONK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Relax now, Bud. Just keep breathing as it fills... don't fight it. Take it in. Just let yourself take it in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONK>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, there's nothing in there to breathe but liquid. His eyes go wide, instant panic. He starts to thrash. Chest heaving.
</DIRECTION>
<MONK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold him. Hold him. This is normal... it'll pass in a second. You're gonna be okay. We all breathe liquid for nine months, Bud. Your body will remember.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONK>
<DIRECTION>
Lindsey grabs Bud's shoulders, steadying him. He finds her eyes, the look calming him. He's passed into a realm from which she has already returned. His spasms subside. He begins to "breathe" normally. He gets a goofy look of wonder on his face, not really believing what he's experiencing. He is alive, alert and quite completely drowned inside the FBS helmet. He grins. Gives a big thumbs up. Lindsey picks up a microphone.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you hear me okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(another thumbs up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Try your keypad.

<DIRECTION>
Bud taps out a brief message. FEELS WEIRD - YOU SHOULD TRY THIS prints out on their portable monitor.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I already have, moron.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDSEY>
<DIRECTION>
They help Bud to the edge of the dive platform. Jammer and Hippy lower Little Geek into the water and Bud grabs onto it. Hippy yells right up next to his helmet.
</DIRECTION>
<HIPPY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I redid Little Geek's chip the same as Big Geek! He should take you right to it. All you gotta do is hang on!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HIPPY>
<DIRECTION>
Lindsey crouches at the edge to watch Bud submerge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up at her as he drops away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a few seconds, she can't see him. Her chin quivers, minutely.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. DEEPCORE/THE WALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FROM FAR BELOW, Deepcore is a faint tiara of lights, above in the blackness. A single moving light appears above, at the edge of the cliff, and starts down. It grows large, resolving into Bud, free-falling down the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He gathers speed as Little Geek's vertical thruster drives them down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud looks down. Between his feet he can see a short way down the wall in the glow of his single light, and beyond that an unfathomable blackness. The wall unrolls upwards out of the darkness like a convoluted gray drapery. He looks up. The lights of Deepcore are gone. He feels more alone than he has ever felt. He types out: CANT SEE YOU
</DIRECTION>
<LINDSEY>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	We're right here with you, Bud. Your depth is 3800 feet. You're doing fine.

WIDE SHOT. Bud is a tiny spider dropping down the wall in a pathetic little pool of light. The wall is sterile brown-gray, devoid of life at this depth. LOOKING DOWN, as the light shrinks to a star and vanishes in the blackness yawning below.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bud, I... uh, there's some things I want to say. It's hard for me. I'm not of those softy, gooey- center-type people. It's not easy, you know, being a cast-iron bitch. It takes discipline and years of training. A lot of people don't appreciate that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDSEY>
<DIRECTION>
Lindsey has somehow tuned out the others in the room. In her mind she is with Bud, out in the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But is wasn't all bad. I know that. You remember that bike trip... we rode the Honda up through Oregon? It took me a week to get my hair untangled, but I've never been happier. It was the most... free... I've ever felt. I'm sorry I can't tell you these things to your face.

<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. THE ABYSS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud is in an enormous school of bioluminescent squid, graceful, attenuated creatures less than a foot long. Thousands of then glide in ghostly arcs around him, filling the black void as far as the eye can see. He stares at them in wonder. Reaches out and touches one, catches it, lets it go. Are they really here? He can no longer be sure of his own perceptions.

<DIRECTION>
Bud emerges from the school of squid. As he falls, they form a luminous plane of swirling colors above him. He stares upwards, transfixed. BUD'S POV, the ghostly blizzard of luminescence above him. A spectral form takes shape in the patternless glow... resolving into Lindsey's face, a hundred feet wide. Gazing down at him, her expression sad. Her image receded away from him into the darkness above as he falls.

Bud is shaking violently, as if with palsy. His eyes keep rolling back, and he's having a hard time staying conscious. He tries to type a message and he can't. The tons of pressure per square inch are short-circuiting his nervous system. Suddenly K-BAM! Little Geek's pressure hull implodes. Its lights go out. BLACKNESS.

Lindsey seems not to be in the room, but to be with him, seeing what he sees. She is oblivious to the others.

:SC: EXT. THE ABYSS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blackness. Then a bright light appears... he's lit a MAGNESIUM FLARE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's fierce, flickering glare lights his plunge. Bud discards the stalwart little ROV and free-falls like a skydiver without a chute. Out of control, he hits a ledge and rolls off. Tumbles forward in a cloud of debris. He hits another outcropping, limp as a rag doll. Rocks and sand rain down with him as he continues his descent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud us quivering, teeth locked in a titanic rigor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls his arms and legs slowly into a fetal position.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the plunge toward death he has gone he has gone full circle, returned to the womb in which we all breathe the water of life before we know the world of air and light. Still, there is Lindsey's voice, faintly in his helmet.

Bud is no longer in pain. His expression is rapt.

LOOKING DOWN, past his to a ghostly landscape. His last flare sputters out, but there is light. Bioluminescent algae carpet the walls of the canyon below him. And he's right... it is beautiful.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The water is so clear we can see down 500 feet past Bud's tiny, silhouetted figure, to a vast landscape faintly revealed in spectral pastels. Barren as the moon but exquisite, serene. Changeless. A place unseen by human eyes. Like a firefly below, the lights of Big Geek are visible. Bud descends toward the ROV, which has grounded on a narrow shelf. Below the shelf, the wall slopes out, suggesting we are near the bottom of the canyon but can't see it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ONE BIG GEEK/MIRV, sitting there like a dumbshit. Bud's feet thump into the sediment next to it, stirring it luminous particles. Touchdown... three and half miles of water over his head. Bud leans over the warhead in a swarm of fireflies.

The only light he has left is a CYALUME STICK. He pulls out the little plastic tube. Breaks and shakes. It starts to glow, a tiny wand of green light. He fumbles with his tool pouch, takes out a pair of side-cutters. CUTING NNOW he types to them. He reaches into the detonator.

<DIRECTION>
A tiny figure lies slumped beside the inert ROV, an Indian dying with his horse in the desert.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud's eyelids close. His chest barely moving.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A strange illumination bathes his face and his eyes open. He blinks. Weakly, he raises his head, facing the source of the radiance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BUD'S POV... A glowing figure hovers before him, like a vision. It seems to be an angel. Seen closer, as it drifts toward him, we see that it is an extraterrestrial being, bioluminescent like some deep-sea fish. Its body and limbs are transparent, and it resembles a figure made of blown glass. A delicate mantle or veil billows out around its like a corona, which pulsates gently, propelling the being with the hypnotic grace of a Spanish dancer. The head is refined and strangely anthropomorphic, with large eyes that convey a cold, dispassionate wisdom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is stunningly beautiful.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The creature settles toward him. Unafraid, Bud extends his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Its slender, blown-glass digits grasp his bulky glove. It pulls him up from the benthic ooze and they glide together down the slope, deeper into the abyss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the limits of visibility we see faint, glowing forms moving below. They resolve into NTI ships. Tiny ovoids, like the little scoutship that Lindsey nearly collided with at the Montana wreck. The larger manta-ships. And others, strangely configured, moving in the darkness below like luminous fish.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the darkness explodes with light. A vast, reticulated pattern of brightly glowing lines, like some enormous circuit diagram, appears below them, covering the floor of the abyssal trench. It sweeps outward from the center, as if the light were surging through channels. The NTIs are revealing their home to Bud. The ships move among the spires like air traffic over a major city.
</DIRECTION>

Bud and the creature descend until, between the lines of light, we see a dark surface of inhuman design. The shape extends beyond the limits of visibility. Towers hundreds of feet high stretch upward from the curving surface. It dwarfs their figures as the descend toward it, approaching an opening that soon yawns like a vast mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are picking up speed, swept along by a powerful current, into the mouth- like opening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. N.T.I. STRUCTURE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud stares around in awe as smooth, pearlescent walls blur past him. It is a curving three-dimensional maze of tunnels, like a vast circulatory system, where controlled currents of water become freeways in three-dimensional space. Tunnels divide, narrow, and reenter main-routes hundreds of feet across, as the pair race through in a dizzying blur.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. FINAL CHAMBER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Entering a smaller chamber they settle to the floor, and the NTI moves back a few feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A shimmering plane or surface appears like a vertical curtain bisecting the chamber. The seawater divides, like the Red Sea, into two rippling walls. They move apart. Leaving Bud standing in a short, shimmering hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Weakly, he uncouples his helmet and pulls it free. Drops to his knees. Doubles over as spasms wrack him. Breathing fluid explodes from his lungs. He lies gasping and coughing on the floor, dragging in deep breaths of what he can only hope is air. It is.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud slowly recovers, sitting up. His head is clearing. This really is happening. Beyond the shimmering, vertical surface of the water he sees the NTI being joined by others, move or less identical, until a group of seven is gathered watching him.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Howdy, Uuuh... how you guys doin'?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
His voice echoes metallically in the strange chamber. Soft laps of water from the 'walls'.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the air a pattern of glowing lines appears, a series of what appears to be circuit diagrams. Bud staggers back from this strange 'screen' hanging in mid-air. The image is about twenty feet across.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a rolling jumble of static and interference which resolves into... the face of Dan Rather, doing the evening news. STATIC, then another newscast. And another. Fragments of the same story. The world on the brink of war.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You watch out TV? That what you're trying to say? That you know what's been going on up there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
The NTIs are impassive. Static... then another newscast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This time, we're allowed to focus on the story. An on-the-scene interview outside a high-tech seismology lab. There is an air of hysteria about the scene... technicians running across the background of the shot, people shouting, the reporter jamming his mike at the harried-looking scientist.
</DIRECTION>
<REPORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... a Caltech scientist who is among those reporting an unprecedented disturbance in the world's oceans. Dr. Breg, can you give us a clearer explanation then we're getting?

Berg is edgy and distracted. People keeps handing him pieces of paper, computer hardcopy. The biggest thing in his life is happening...
</DIRECTION>
<BERG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're acoustic shockwaves, like tsunamis, but with no seismological source. The waves are propagating toward the shorelines of every continent--

An assistant runs up, face shiny with fear, beckoning. We see that Berg is running scared. The impossible bringing the greatest terror to the rational mind.
</DIRECTION>
<BERG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. I'll be right there... I have to go. Look, we don't know what it is! Okay? Not the slightest goddamn idea!
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
The image dissolves into static, fades out. Bud turns to the NTIs.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're doing it! Right? That's what you're telling me. Yeah, you can control water... that's your technology. But why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
Static again, then a brilliant flash. Grainy stock film of a hydrogen bomb test in the Pacific.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The film repeats, and then again, faster, and again until is merges into an unbroken white glare. Bud gets the message.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, you don't know they're really gonna do it. Where do you get off passing judgment on us, when you can't be sure? How do you know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
The screen exploded into a staccato series of searing images, stark moments from recent history...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
US soldiers fighting in Vietnam, street warfare in Beirut, a car bomb in Belfast, a suspect shot in the head in the streets of Saigon, burned and bleeding children, grainy footage of corpses bulldozed into mass graves at Auschwitz, Wermacht soldiers marching in goose-step review, a 13-year-old contra with an AK-47... Just glimpses, strobing... a few frames of each. But enough. The images continue.

HOLD ON BUD, as the lights flicker on his face, the ongoing indictment of humanity.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A video news crew leaps from a Jet Ranger helicopter in a parking area and runs to set up near the railing, facing the ocean. Pandemonium reigns around them, people running, driving, evacuating inland.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the horizon, out to sea, a dark line has appeared.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It grows in height as it comes closer, a wall of water stretching across the horizon, already hundreds of feet high and growing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. NEW YORK -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LONG LENSE SHOT, looking seaward past the Statue of Liberty, out past the Verazzano Narrows. Stacked up by perspective, the distant wave is a wall of water impossibly high, still miles out.

:SC: EXT. NAVAL BASE, KAMCHATKA PENINSULA, U.S.S.R. -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The scene repeats on the eastern coast of the Kamchatka Penninsula in Russia, where a full moon shimmers along the crest of a vast wave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SIRENS wail as Russian sailors run from the docks of Petropavlovsk Naval Base. Some stand rooted as the black glacier of water, a thousand feet high and growing, thunders toward them in nightmarish slow motion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. OCEAN FRONT, SANTA MONICA -- DAY

<DIRECTION>
The minicam crew reporter is speaking rapidly, faltering with emotion, his voice cracking like the famous broadcast from the scene of the Hindenburg disaster.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	The horizon has gone dark... the crowd is starting to run... some are just staring, unable to move... the wave... the wave is... it's... I don't know... maybe a thousand feet high already... getting bigger as I'm watching... still miles out... oh my God, Jesus... I can hear it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</REPORTER>
<DIRECTION>
A roar fills the air, a thunder which drowns out the people's screams, even the rotors of the news chopper as the camera teams scrambles aboard. They leave the announcer standing transfixed, his face blank, eyes tracking upward and upward as the ground begins to shake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. NEW YORK -- DAY
</DIRECTION>

The Statue of Liberty looks like a souvenir figurine at the afternoon sun is blocked out by the cresting tsunami, an escarpment of water 2500 feet tall.

<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. SAN FRANSISCO -- DAY

LONG LENS SHOT -- The Golden Gate Bridge and the hills of the city, the buildings downtown. Beyond, FILLING FRAME is the wall of sea green which defies our comprehension. The image shakes with the THUNDER.

:SC: EXT. MALIBU -- DAY

A diehard surfer looks over his shoulder as the mountain of water which transcends his worst nightmare. He lies paralyzed on his board.

<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. MIAMI -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Downtown Miami crouches in terror at the feet of the shimmering monolith.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a penthouse office suite, an executive watches the wave towering above him, blocking out the sun, a line of raging foam appearing as it arches over, about to break upon the teeming city.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wave slows as it crests...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IT SIMPLY STOPS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
2600 feet high and motionless except for a shimmering undulation of its surface in the bright sun. There is quiet, a faint wind and calling of confused gulls. Various reactions, as the thunder fades and people recover, only to stand awed before the vast, inexplicable manifestation. A news helicopter passes in front of it like a dragonfly.

The surfer just blinks, starting.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Russian seamen, lining the harbor breakwall at Petropavlovsk Naval Base on the Kamchatka Peninsula, stare upward at the monolith of water, undulating in the moonlight. It seems poised to crash down, inflicting inconceivable devastation... but it doesn't.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. OCEAN FRONT WALK, SANTA MONICA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When all have seen...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wave soundlessly subsides, slowly slipping back and down until the surface of the sea is normal again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIDEO SHOT, HANDHELD, of a crowd of people watching the sea. Moving from face to face. Various reactions as people respond to what they can only understand as a miracle. The faces... awed, stunned, tear-streaked... laughing. The cameraman is just walking. Some people turn to him and smile, or laugh, or whoop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A woman is collapsed on a bench, crying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A man is on his knees, shaking.

The screen darkens. Then letters appears on it, slowly printing out, as if someone was clumsily typing them.

<DIRECTION>
A pause, then:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOVE YOU WIFE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The last message expands to fill the entire screen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud stares at the screen, at his message of self-sacrifice, then at the aliens. They bow their heads, just for a moment. A sign of respect.

CLOSE ON BUD as he begins to realize what has happened.

<DIRECTION>
A depression appears in the surface of the sea a hundred yards off, not swirling down like a whirlpool, just dimpling down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It gets wider. Deeper. Rapidly becomes a yawning pit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ocean is OPENING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now the surface is churned by turbulence. Slow massive roils of tremendous power boil up from the depths.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
McBride leads a mass exodus onto the deck to see better.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The open becomes a roaring maw a hundred yards across.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ships are like toys on the shimmering rim of the maelstrom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOMETHING RISES IN THE CENTER OF THE OPENING. A massive spire. Smoothly curving and iridescent. Off the starboard beam, a quarter mile away, another spire rises. Tons of seawater fall from its sides with a THUNDEROUS ROAR, the energy of Niagara.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Off the port bow... another spire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And another, beyond the destroyer Albany, dwarfing it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Six towers... plus one larger, in the center. Rising.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One the Explorer's deck, a shadow engulfs them as the nearest spire blocks out the sun. The air, the sea, the deck... all vibrate with the THUNDER OF CREATION.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And now for the payoff shot: WE'RE HIGH, LOOKING DOWN. THE SPIRES FORM A PERFECT RING A MILE ACROSS. A VAST DARK FORM, LIKE A GREAT SHADOW, RISES FROM THE DEPTHS BENEATH THE SHIPS. THE SPIRES ARE CONNECTED. IT IS ALL ONE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE NTI ARK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It surfaces with slow majesty, gently beaching all the ships on its broad back. We recognize it as the structure into which Bud was led by the angelic being, which we assumed was a city. The Explorer rocks gently on its flat hull, clunking massively to one side as it settles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bridge crew watch millions of tons of seawater streaming off the back of the vast, slightly curved hull. The missile cruiser rocks back and forth nearby, high and dry... its prop whining futility.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON EXPLORER'S DECK, McBride, Bendix, DeMarco, the rest of the Navy contingent... they're all standing there open-mouthed, in a dream-like daze. Touched by the hand of God.

Catfish's feet appear, bicycling. He swings down to the pearlescent 'deck'. Stands there blinking in the sunlight, mole-like. Jammer plonks down behind him. He turns, lifts Lindsey down. Hippy, Sonny, and the rest, emerge into the light of the sun. A deliverance from the blackest night they will ever know.

REVERSE, as Bud walks up the curving incline of one of the mouth-like enterances to the NTI structure. His suit is casually unzipped and the FBS helmet dangles from one hand jauntily.

She starts toward him. Breaks into a run. Then stops a few feet from him. Watching him come to her.

His smile, his eyes illuminating her.
