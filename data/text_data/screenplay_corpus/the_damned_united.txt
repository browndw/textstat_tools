</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flashlights pop as DON REVIE, (late 40's), the most successful manager in English football, walks out in front of a pack of newspaper and TV REPORTERS. He is flanked by the Chairman of Leeds United, (MANNY CUSSINS, 60's), and several other white-haired blazer-wearing members of the Board.

	Yesterday afternoon at 3.00, I accepted the FA's offer to become the next manager of the England national football team.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REVIE>
<DIRECTION>
A gasp among the JOURNALISTS. A burst of flashlights. The BOARD MEMBERS look down at the floor in silence. Bereaved fathers losing their favourite son.
</DIRECTION>
<REVIE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Obviously that involves me leaving Leeds United after 13 happy and successful years, which makes me very sad. I'd like to think I have built the club into a family and there must be sadness when anybody leaves a family. However, when one man goes, another steps into his place. I know who I think that person should be, the man to replace me, and I shall make my feelings clear to the directors. Thank you. No further comments.

Two young BOYS, (12, 9) stare out of car windows. Raindrops on the panes of glass. Their father, BRIAN CLOUGH, (39), slick, modern, cocky, handsome. About as big a contrast to DON REVIE as it's possible to find, is up front. Driving..

	</DIALOGUE>
</CLOUGH>
<MITCHELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A surprising choice, some might say. Because you've been very vocal in your criticism of them over the years.

	I would accept and expect a strangeness, initially, it's perfectly normal. But it won't be long before they realise I'm a fair man. A kind man. And maybe under me they can experience what it's like to be in a happy family, after all.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He places the bottles on his desk. Then puts two cut crystal glasses on his desk. His and Don's.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A flicker of jealousy on PETER TAYLOR's face, almost like a wife - hurt that his friend is making such an effort for someone else.

<DIRECTION>
TAYLOR mutters under his breath, "Soppy twat".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOUGH cranes his neck. Watches DON REVIE, 40's. Thick-set. Severe, forbidding, intimidating, in a huddle with his coaching staff, Les Cocker and Syd Owen. His henchmen. His assassins. His "Goodfellas". His right and left hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOUGH walks towards him. Hand outstretched..
</DIRECTION>
<CLOUGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Welcome to Derby, Don. Pleasure to meet you. I'm Brian Clough.

<DIRECTION>
But REVIE walks past without shaking hands, without talking, without even breaking stride..
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
..and disappears into the stadium, deep in conversation with Les Cocker and Syd Owen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOUGH stares. Hand still outstretched. He looks over at PETER TAYLOR, who can't help smiling, `Forget it'.

TAYLOR and JIMMY GORDON walk off, but CLOUGH still stares at REVIE in disbelief.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TAYLOR rubs his hands in excitement, "Here we go". But CLOUGH is miles away. Still cannot let the insult go. He stares over at the visiting team dug-out..
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVIE and his lieutenants. Whispering among themselves. Huddled in thought. Huddled in strategy. Huddled in malevolence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Presently, the game starts. A roar from the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"Beeeep", the REF's whistle blows. A Derby PLAYER rolls in agony, cries out, a terrible, cynical challenge. Horrified, JIMMY GORDON and PETER TAYLOR up on thier feet in protest..
</DIRECTION>

	Referee..!
	</DIALOGUE>

CLOUGH looks over to REVIE's bench. Sees REVIE and SYD OWEN quietly applauding the Leeds PLAYER. Encouraging more of the same. As the Derby PLAYER is stretchered off..
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Presently, RRROOOOAAAARRRRR goes up. Goal Leeds. REVIE and his henchmen get to their feet. Applauding. 1-0.

Suddenly:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"Beeep!", whistle! Penatly Leeds! CLOUGH leaps off the bench in outrage. Screaming, on his feel, protesting in disbelief..
</DIRECTION>
<CLOUGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? He didn't fucking touch him! Ref! He DIVED! He fucking dived!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
REVIE shaking hands with his COLLEAGUES. Smiling amongst themselves. Congratulating themselves. Celebrating.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The inevitable roar as Leeds convert, followed by, "Beeeeeep", the sound of the final WHISTLE. CLOUGH stares in disbelief. Robbed. Deflated.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The REFEREE blows the whistle for the end of the game.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOUGH watches as REVIE and SYD OWEN brush past, shaking PETER TAYLOR and JIMMY GORDON's hands, (assuming TAYLOR's the manager), on their way to the dressing-rooms, their minds already on their next game...

Presently...CLOUGH's view, and our frame is filled by two wheel-chairs carrying disabled/learning difficulties FANS wearing rosettes...

Already fearing the rocket they will get, the lash of his tongue..

Presently, the door opens, and CLOUGH walks in, carrying a bottle of brandy, Remy Martin.

CLOUGH pacing in his office. Unable to watch. Like an expectant father.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Presently the building reverberates with a large... RRRROOOAAAARRRRRRRRR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A goal. But scored by whom? Derby or Leeds?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOUGH looks up at the clock. The clock on the wall shows it's 4.20.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Visibly anxious, CLOUGH starts pacing again. Presently, another deafening...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RRRRROOOOOAAAAARRRRRRR

<DIRECTION>
The building is almost brought to it's foundations..
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOUGH looks up. Desperate to know. Derby or Leeds? But it's only 4.35. Game still not over. Not by a long way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOUGH carries on pacing. Walks from one side of the room to the next. Left to right. Right to left.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, another stadium-shaking..
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RRRRRROOOOOOAAAAAARRRRRR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOUGH looks up at the clock. 4.55.

This is intolerable. The game must be over now.

CLOUGH cannot bear it a moment longer. He opens the door.

CLOUGH turns a corner to the dressing-rooms and the tunnel, then sees PETER TAYLOR up ahead entering the tunnel from the pitch with several Derby PLAYERS..
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOUGH stops. TAYLOR looks up. Sees CLOUGH. Their eyes meet. CLOUGH's eyes. TAYLOR's eyes.
</DIRECTION>

Words are not necessary. TAYLOR's smile says it all. CLOUGH runs towards TAYLOR. The two men embrace.

	Derby County winning the championship is a victory for decency, for honesty and for football. Because they don't pull shirts, or nudge people in the back in the box. They don't protest every decision, chop, hack or bully - unlike some teams I could mention - beginning with the letter `L'..

	He's a very, very talented man and his record is unsurpassable. But I just happen not to like him. And I don't like the way he goes about football either. Football is a game of opinion and there are perhaps people in your profession who don't like the way you do your bit.

	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(some clap in the
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	audience). And every time they open their mouths it kills it. Because the very thing they've given me a lot of stick about over the years - about talking too much and going on television too much, there are the very people who can put two words together and its rather embarrassing to me that a man - or men - can stop me talking to people like you. I love football. It's deep, it goes right down through. It's in every nerve, vein, you name it. It consumes me. And when I have to come and talk about I like the passions of football to come out. Because there are not enough in the game. I like a bit of the honesty, I like a bit of the truth. I accept without any shadow of a doubt that I talk too much, apart from on this show.

	That's right. You were Chairman of Derby County before I came here. I remember that. When Derby County were at the fucking foot of the Second Division, when nobody had heard of them for twenty years and nobody had heard of Sam bloody Longson ever. Full stop. And that's where you'd still fucking be if it wasn't for me; at the foot of the bloody Second Division, where nobody remembered you and nobody had heard of you.

	I'm going to give you some good advice, Brian Clough. No matter how good you think you are, or how clever, or how many fancy new friends you make on the telly, the reality of footballing life is this: the Chairman is the boss, then come the directors, then the secretary, then the fans, then the players, and finally, last of all, bottom-of-the- heap, lowest of the low, the one in the end we can all without, is the bloody manager.

CLOUGH shoots his cuffs. Rolls his neck. A boxer on his way to the ring. A gladiator on his way to the circus.

	No, it's not. It's YOU. This monster in you. This mad ambition. It comes and goes. Sometimes it's good...a fire, that stirs everything up, and then there's this...this thing that takes you over...and destroys everything that is good in your life.

CLOUGH takes his seat alone in the dugout. Unseen by him, in the stands behind him...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DON REVIE arrives, shaking hands, taking a seat.
</DIRECTION>

Immediately, as soon as they see REVIE, the LEEDS FANS start cheering, "There's only one Don Revie.."

CLOUGH turns, to see REVIE. Waving back. Acknowledging the crowd.

<CUSSINS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the worst start to a season Leeds has had in twenty years. Four points from five games? Second from fucking bottom? What's going on? As far as I can I see, there's no relationship, no understanding between players and management. Not a healthy one, anyway.

INT. YORKSHIRE TV STUDIOS - DAY - (1974) CLOUGH is led into the studio, and onto the `Calender' set, chatting to the SOUND MAN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOUGH's microphone is fixed, he is shown to his seat beside the PRESENTER's. Then CLOUGH notices a third (empty) seat beside his..
</DIRECTION>
<CLOUGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's this? We expecting guests?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLOUGH>
<DIRECTION>
Then CLOUGH looks up to see a distinctive BLUE BLAZER, with gold buttons approaching the set...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blue blazer. DON's blazer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOUGH's face falls as DON REVIE and AUSTIN MITCHELL turn the corner, in conspiratorial conversation, and out to the seats..
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a set-up! CLOUGH looks over at AUSTIN MITCHELL and the crew, who shiftily avoids CLOUGH's eyes..
</DIRECTION>
<CLOUGH>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You bastards!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLOUGH>
<DIRECTION>
REVIE is put in the seat beside CLOUGH. Avoiding CLOUGH's eyes. REVIE rolls his neck, crosses his legs. Vast, intimidating REVIE. Ready for battle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the theme music plays, the FLOOR MANAGER counts down..
</DIRECTION>
<FLOOR_MANAGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Five, four, three..
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The PRESENTER looks up..
</DIRECTION>
<MITCHELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good evening. Tonight the football world was stunned by the news that Brian Clough has been sacked as manager of Leeds United. We'll be talking not just to Brian Clough, but also to the man he replaced, who's success he couldn't emulate, Don Revie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MITCHELL>
<DIRECTION>
MITCHELL turns to CLOUGH..
</DIRECTION>
<MITCHELL>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To Brian Clough first of all. What's your reaction to being sacked in this fashion?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MITCHELL>
<CLOUGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Obviously, Austin, my initial reaction is one of shock at finding myself here with Revie...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLOUGH>
<REVIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See? Not so easy to make accusations when it's to someone's face...
	</DIALOGUE>
</REVIE>
<CLOUGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...but in answer to your question, six weeks is hardly a long time to be given a chance in any job. I would hope Revie would get a lot longer time in his.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLOUGH>
<MITCHELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you consider it was possible to step into your shoes, Don Revie? To replace you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MITCHELL>
<REVIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Being very, very honest, I think it was a difficult job for anyone to do. But I do feel Brian Clough, I won't call him Clough because I won't take him down like that..
	</DIALOGUE>
</REVIE>
<CLOUGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLOUGH>
<REVIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I do feel he made it harder for himself than he need have.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REVIE>
<CLOUGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did I do that, Don?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLOUGH>
<REVIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shooting his mouth off about how dirty my players were.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REVIE>
<CLOUGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you WERE dirty, Don!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLOUGH>
<REVIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not true. The last four seasons, we've topped the charts for entertaining football.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REVIE>
<CLOUGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And before that, you also topped ALL the disciplinary charts. You should have been docked points and sent DOWN to the second Division.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLOUGH>
<MITCHELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And in fact, you went on record and said so, Brian Clough. Again and again. That Leeds should, in fact, be relegated.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MITCHELL>
<CLOUGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I was right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLOUGH>
<MITCHELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you think that might have hurt your chances of success when you then came to manage them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MITCHELL>
<REVIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course it did! The things he said? Why, man? Why did you take the job in the first place?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REVIE>
<CLOUGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I thought it was the best job in the country.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLOUGH>
<REVIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course it was the best job in the country.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REVIE>
<CLOUGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was taking over the League Champions.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLOUGH>
<REVIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were. You were taking over the best bunch of players you'd ever seen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REVIE>
<CLOUGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I fancied winning the league, and winning Europe, and doing it better than you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLOUGH>
<REVIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's no way you COULD win it better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REVIE>
<CLOUGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But that's the only hope I've got.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLOUGH>
<REVIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I only lost four matches..
	</DIALOGUE>
</REVIE>
<CLOUGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I can only lose three.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLOUGH>
<REVIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no, no, no.
	</DIALOGUE>
<CLOUGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And still play attractive, clean football. Without cheating!
	</DIALOGUE>
</REVIE>
<REVIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See, there he goes again..
	</DIALOGUE>
</REVIE>
<MITCHELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listening to you, I am struck that this is not just a business matter for you both. It's more than that. It's personal. Am I right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MITCHELL>
<CLOUGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, we're very different people, Don and I. We have different styles. In football and in life. I'm a warm man. An idealist. I do believe in faeries, and that is my outlook. Don is different. There's a hardness to him. A hardness. Maybe he's not even aware of it. But he's a cold person.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLOUGH>
<REVIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't KNOW me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</REVIE>
<CLOUGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that lack of warmth. That coldness was there. Permeated the club when I arrived.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLOUGH>
<REVIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I totally refute that. The atmosphere at Leeds was like a family. A happy family. You ask any of my players. I signed most of them personally. Knew their backgrounds. Their parents. Their streets. I was a father to them. In that club every morning. Massaging those boys. Did you do that for them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REVIE>
<CLOUGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They would never have let me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLOUGH>
<REVIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you try? You didn't even try. I soaped those boys down with my own hands. You just went to Leeds with no thought for the club, no thought for the players. Just on some kind of mad personal vendetta with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REVIE>
<CLOUGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well are you surprised? What else was I going to do?? After what you did...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLOUGH>
<REVIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did I do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REVIE>
<CLOUGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, Don. You know exactly. 4th March 1968. See? I even remember the date. You came to Derby County, the third round of the FA Cup, and you refused to shake my hand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLOUGH>
<DIRECTION>
AUSTIN MITCHELL looks up. The CAMERAMEN look up.
</DIRECTION>
<REVIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never! Matter of principle! I always shake the other manager's hand!
	</DIALOGUE>
</REVIE>
<CLOUGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You shook Peter Taylor's hand, and my trainer, Jimmy Gordon's.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLOUGH>
<REVIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then I probably didn't see you!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</REVIE>
<CLOUGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you saw me Don. But considered me beneath you. Looked down on me. And dismissed me. Just like you did every other club and every other manager in the country.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLOUGH>
<REVIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never would I knowingly refuse to shake a colleague's hand. The truth is, I probably just didn't know who you were.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REVIE>
<CLOUGH>
<DIRECTION>
(a knowing smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Didn't know who I was!" Pull the other one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLOUGH>
<REVIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the truth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REVIE>
<CLOUGH>
<DIRECTION>
(blurts out)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you certainly know it NOW.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLOUGH>
<DIRECTION>
All heads turn. That came out unintentionally loud.
</DIRECTION>
<REVIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, we ALL know it now.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We know you as the man who's constant outbursts, his defaming of fellow professionals, have brought this game, this beautiful game into disrepute. Who had one of the best jobs in the country, at Derby, and managed to get the sack. Who had one of the best partners in the game, in Peter Taylor, and threw him away. Who was given the greatest gift in British football Leeds United, a team that in ten years hasn't finished outside the top four, and took them to the bottom of the first division. Yes, it's fair to say we all know who you are now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REVIE>
<DIRECTION>
AUSTIN MITCHELL's eyes widen.
</DIRECTION>
<MITCHELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OK, gentlemen, we're going to have to leave it there..
	</DIALOGUE>
</MITCHELL>
<CLOUGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, let's see where we are in a year's time, Donald Revie.
	</DIALOGUE>
<REVIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dear oh dear..
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLOUGH>
<CLOUGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's see where we both are in five!
