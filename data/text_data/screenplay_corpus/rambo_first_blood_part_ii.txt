EXT. ROCK QUARRY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A massive explosion that blows dust into the SHOT OF THE SUN. PANNING DOWN, we are at a quarry where twenty-five hardened criminals are slowly revealed by still MOVING CAMERA. All the well-built men wear the same federal prison clothing. Most wear tattered tank tops with a large "P" stenciled on the back... Five armed guards watch over the convicts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We finally PAN ACROSS the rising and falling of picks and shovels, ARRIVING on a wide back with an array of scars. SLOWLY MOVING UP the back, we reveal RAMBO swinging a sledge hammer onto an iron wedge sunk into the white rock quarry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rambo continues to pound away with deft strokes, finally splitting the rock. He lets his hammer rest at his side and turns to look up at the nearest guard. He nods. The guard nods back and Rambo turns and moves to a water bucket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He waits for a black convict to finish drinking out of a ladle that is attached to a large bucket.

Rambo looks up at a pair of PRISON GUARDS whose faces and bodies are nearly indistinguishable because of the bright sun that backlights them with a hellish glow.

Rambo is led toward the top of the quarry, flanked by the two Prison Guards, passing the prisoners working away... Suddenly, TRAUTMAN steps into view, blocking Rambo's path.
</DIRECTION>
<TRAUTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How've you been, Johnny?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRAUTMAN>

Rambo nods and stares into Trautman's eyes. The silence is shattering.

	That's all... Thanks.

The Guards move off.

Rambo continues his stare. Trautman, a little uncomfortable, continues.

</RAMBO>
<TRAUTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The prison camp you escaped from in '71 is the target area -- no one knows that terrain better than you. The risk factor is very high. You'll be temporarily reinstated in the forces; and if the operation is successful, there may be a Congressional pardon... are you in, John?
	</DIALOGUE>

Rambo's eyes turn into Trautman's. He nods his acceptance.

	Good. I'll get the necessary clearances, and the next time we'll meet, it'll be in Thailand with Special OP's designate who will honch the operation. All clear?

Trautman shakes Rambo's hand and starts to turn away.

Rambo nods... He believes him...

Trautman starts to leave.

The SOUND OF A CHOPPER is heard and slowly the chopper's blades slash INTO VIEW. The chopper first moves across the city of Bangkok, then past the canals... It passes over temples, farmland and oxen. Over rice paddies and ascends into the clouds hovering above the vast rain forests.

In a rollercoaster movement, the chopper clears the mountain top and descending through the morning haze, we see below a military base once used during the war. It still has several buildings standing and hangers line an airstrip. The majority of base is Thai Army with the far end being reserved for American military.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BASE CAMP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rambo's chopper lands in a fury of dust and he exits. His hands are cuffed. Behind him is an M.P. Rambo is greeted by a sharp-featured American dressed in half-military, half-civilian. The chopper cuts its engines. ERICSON speaks with an air of worldly confidence...
</DIRECTION>
<ERICSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can take them off.

<DIRECTION>
Rambo studies Ericson with a raking glance. The cuffs are removed...

<ERICSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How ya doing, Rambo, I'm Ericson. We better make it over to the hanger.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICSON>
<DIRECTION>
Rambo follows along.
</DIRECTION>
<ERICSON>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you're the chosen one. You don't remember me do ya? We were in boot camp together in '63. You went Forces, I went Rangers... haven't been stateside since '72. Plenty of work here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICSON>

They move towards the hanger. Active military personnel head in a multitude of directions. Many are taken aback by Rambo's strange appearance.
</DIRECTION>
<ERICSON>

(continuing)

	<DIALOGUE>
	You've made a hell of a rep back in Nam. Anyway, I'm glad to be workin' with ya, and... this place may not be heaven, but at least you're out of prison.

A section of the hanger turns out to be a HUMMING electronic womb. Rambo and Ericson enter.

<ERICSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pretty soon we'll all be out of a job. Somebody oughta blow it to hell and keep fightin' simple.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICSON>
<DIRECTION>
In the subdued light, banks of video monitors glow, and the status light of upright computer units line one wall. Work stations for tracking, communications, and long-range coordination create a claustrophobic jumble of modular equipment racks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rambo and Ericson walk towards the center of the hanger as a few TECHNICIANS stare at Rambo's unkempt, almost savage appearance from several yards away.
</DIRECTION>
<TECH_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that?

<TECH_2>
	<DIALOGUE>

<TECH_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Going in? He looks like he just came out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TECH_1>
<DIRECTION>
Ericson enters first, followed by Rambo. At the far end of the dark, voluminous hanger is Trautman. Next to him is MARSHALL MURDOCK, a robust thick-set man. Murdock, dressed in his white shirt and half-undone tie, looks like a displaced corporate type. In the corner is another mercenary named LIFER. Lifer is unnerving in his silent attitude and ever present sunglasses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Murdock sweats profusely in the Thailand heat. He speaks with a relaxed smoothness with whomever he is addressing. Murdock has a makeshift office set up at the rear of the hanger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they approach Trautman and Murdock:
</DIRECTION>
<TRAUTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(stepping forward)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There he is -- 'morning, John.

Rambo nods and shakes his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<MURDOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Colonel; I've been looking forward to meeting you. So how was the trip -- no problem?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURDOCK>
<DIRECTION>
Rambo shakes his head "no."
</DIRECTION>
<MURDOCK>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	None except for this damn heat, right? Never felt anything like it. Anyway, let's get down to business -- Rambo, I glanced through your files and I must say it provided interesting reading.

<DIRECTION>
(he opens a folder)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rambo, John J., born 7/6/47 Bowie, Arizona of Indian-Italian-German descent. Joined army 8/6/64. Accepted, Special Forces specialization, light weapons, crossed-trained as medic. Helicopter and language qualified -- 59 confirmed kills --

Ericson eyes Rambo, who remains impassive.

<DIRECTION>
(continuing, reading)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... two Silver Stars, four Bronze, four Purple Hearts, Distinguished Service Cross, and the Medal of Honor... You did get around, didn't you... incredible. Now you're probably aware that there are still nearly twenty-five hundred Americans missing in action in Southeast Asia. Most of these boys are presumed killed. But to the League of Families -- Congress, and to a lot of Americans, it's still a very emotional issue.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Ericson)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get me something cold, please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURDOCK>
<DIRECTION>
Ericson opens a Coke machine by turning the key that is in the front of the machine and reaches inside.
</DIRECTION>
<MURDOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rambo, you certainly don't know as much about me as I do about you, but I was honching with the Second Battalion, Third Marines at Kom Tum in sixty-six and lost a lot of good men, so I know what you and every Vet feels. Maybe the government didn't care, maybe certain sectors of the public didn't care but my committee cares. It may have been a bad war, but the men weren't bad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURDOCK>
<DIRECTION>
Rambo nods.
</DIRECTION>
<TRAUTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what his committee needs is conclusive proof that Americans are being held.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRAUTMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Murdock presents Rambo with a photograph.
</DIRECTION>
<MURDOCK>
<DIRECTION>
(overriding)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And once done, you can be assured we'll get our men back...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(rapidly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If there's any of our men left at the P.O.W. targer camp you'll confirm their presence by taking photographs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURDOCK>
<RAMBO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Photographs?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAMBO>
<MURDOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just photographs. Then you turn those photos over to me.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Not exactly -- the phrase two Delta Force assault team led by Colonel Trautman will handle the extraction.

</MURDOCK>
<DIRECTION>
Murdock steps up and is backlit as he confronts Rambo. He shakes Rambo's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<MURDOCK>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyway, I want to say that with your participation I feel this mission has a better than average chance of succeeding where others have failed... I'll meet you both at the operations center in one hour.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURDOCK>
<DIRECTION>
Murdock and Ericson exit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rambo stares at him exiting. The tension is broken by Trautman's voice.

Trautman and Rambo pass a tent-like camouflage canopy under which an all-black Agusta 109 helicopter squats ominously. It has no markings and contents of which are screened from view. LIFER is attending to the chopper.

	From Thailand, across Laos, into the mountains of Vietnam to the drop zone. You'll be flying a ceiling of 250 feet when you bail out, can you handle it?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Give it a try --
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAMBO>
<TRAUTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The code name for the insertion and extraction flight team is "Dragonfly"; home base "Wolf Den," your code name if "Lone Wolf." Since you're going solo, you are going to have to rely upon more equipment than you've ever used before, and use it -- so what I'm sayin' is, don't try the "blood and guts" routine, let technology do most of the work. If you need assistance, call for it.

Rambo gives him a cold stare and heads outside.
</DIRECTION>
<MURDOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Colonel, are you sure he's not still unbalanced from the war? We can't afford to have anyone involved who might crack under pressure in that hell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURDOCK>
<TRAUTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pressure? Let me just say that Rambo's the best combat Vet I've ever seen. A pure fighting machine with only a desire, to win a war someone else lost, and if winning means he has to die, he'll die. No fear. No regrets... one more thing... what you choose to call "Hell", he calls home.

Serene despite the ravages of centuries, two stone Buddhas sit flanking the stairs to the ruined temple. Trees and vines all but obscure the cracked and tumbled forms of ornately carved walls.

The central courtyard is open to the sky. Spire-like structures are dimly visible in the fog beyond.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Moving in the shadows, Rambo walks through the ruins noiselessly. Rambo senses movement and lunging to the side draws his pistol and goes into a combat ready stance. The figure in the undergrowth takes shifts position. Rambo takes up a new position. What appears to be a Viet soldier shifts position again; likewise Rambo.

Crudely fashioned hut of corrugated sheet metal and bamboo walls among the naked tree roots in a brackish inlet off the main river. Out on the edge overhanging the river are two men, drunk and loudly speaking. Possibly two of the most misbegotten specimens ever seen. Modern day pirates.

The sunlight filters into the dusty, dark hut, which is nothing more than a den of eight incredibly vicious- looking thieves... most of them drink and smoke... two worn-out river whores are present.

Every conceivable space is crammed with scavenged or looted detritus: ammo cases, hubcaps, radios, a TV with no back, several guns, and a shotgun is seen among the junk. Some of the pirates are smoking opium.
</DIRECTION>

Wearing all manner of jewelry, including four wristwatches and a pair of filthy Western-style jeans a size too large, CAPTAIN TRONG KINH grins and motions them in.

Two guard towers are uniquely built into trees that grow diagonally at opposite corners of the compound. There is a maze of rolled barbed wire on wooden posts enclosing the area and a main gate with a sentry box, that is built into the hollow of a tree.

Three wooden barracks form a U, around the large but concealed opening in the side of a rock formation. All this can be near a riverbank or swamp. The camp is totally original in its oppressive design, and contrary to the way most prison camps are depicted in bright open areas. This one is dark and recessed into the hellish terrain.

Rambo half-supports Banks with one arm and FIRES his AK with the other.

The rifle is empty and he drops it. MORTAR ROUNDS EXPLODE on all sides. They watch the A109 skimming in low across the tree tops, almost to them... hovers and then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It veers in a tight bank and climbs out.

Framed against the grey sky, Rambo watches as the A109 diminishes over his shoulder until it's a black dot. He is so consumed with rage that his expression goes slack... blank... a murderous disconnection from conscience.

<DIRECTION>
Banks looks stunned, lost. He sags to one knee.

Rambo just keeps looking in the direction of the A109.

Another WHACK! heard from across the compound. All the P.O.W.'s are there.

Two of them, b.g., seem completely autistic. The others seem to wince, as one, with Banks, as the WHACKS ECHO across the compound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PRISON YARD - SLIME PIT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Off to one side of the camp in a gloomy shaded area is the pit that is filled with slime. It is ten feet deep, eight feet wide. CAPTAIN VINH, a severe-looking tyrant, observes Sgt. Tay standing on a pair of planks near Rambo, who is being slowly submerged in the slime up to his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sgt. Tay looks to Capt. Vinh who nods and Tay backhands Rambo across the face. Rambo spits.

Tay has Rambo's special knife tucked in his waistband.

EXT. SLIME PIT - RAMBO - DAY

Rambo is pulled upright and we can see that he is bound to a pole in a crucified position... Upon closer inspection we see his body is covered with at least twenty huge blood-gorged leeches.

EXT. P.O.W. CAMP - OFFICERS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two Russian officers approach and coldy eye Rambo who is slightly suspended above them... Capt. Vinh and Sgt. Tay stand near the Russians. PODOVSK, the shorter, brighter-looking of the two, pulls Rambo's knife from Tay's waistband and, with a casual air, uses the tip of the razor-sharp knife to sever a black leech from the base of Rambo's neck... He handles the knife like a masterful surgeon.

Vinh sends the gawking guards scurrying with strident yells as he follows the two Russians into the room. The Soviets stand in front of Rambo. He is bare from the waist up. Lt. Commander Podovsk has a hard face, sharp features. His bearing is erect, arrogant. He still has Rambo's knife in his hand, which he uses like a painter when he speaks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The other, SGT. YUSHIN, is another story. A tall, broad slab of combat muscle. His hair cut short as a scrub brush. Thick and functional as state sculpture, his features cannot fill his broad, flat face Nordic Mongolian-Circassian heritage... He wears a pine tree patch on his shoulder denoting his status as a "plastune" or cossack scout.

(continuing)

	But this -- your capture -- this incident is -- embarrassing. You must understand. We must have explanation. First I wish for you to radio back to your headquarters and say you found no prisoners, that your operation was a failure.

An iron bedframe has been brought in and leaned vertically against the wall opposite the door... Charcoal smoke fills the room.

Eyes closed, he has smeared the goo thoroughly over his face. It is a neolithic, feral visage. He has buried Co and pauses on one knee at the gravesite... around his neck hangs her "good luck" medallion. He has cut a strip of her garment and with great deliberation ties it around his head.
