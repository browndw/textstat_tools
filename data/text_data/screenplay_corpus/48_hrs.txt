</CATES>
<HADEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jack, come on, there is an official department policy about cop killings. Cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian... In other words, we can't seen like we're in the revenge business... I know, we all know the truth's a little different.

PRISON CELL BLOCK - DAY

Cates and a GUARD on the upper deck approaching the door to the cell block... The Guard shouts upward.

The Guard shrugs, stays by the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CATES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks down the cell block. Inmates stare at him from inside the stark cells. They don't know who he is, but they can smell a cop. Cates stops at Twenty-two, looks inside... a bit startled. Obviously, Reggie Hammond has connections and taste. The paint is fresh; there's framed prints on the wall instead of pin-ups, and the overall feeling is that of a graduate school dorm rather than a prison. Cates turns, nods to the Guard at the end of the cell block. He throws a switch and the door opens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HAMMOND'S CELL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cates steps inside. Hammond is at a table wearing a Sony Walkman and writing in some detailed ledgers with a fountain pen. He's boogeying in his seat to the music. Sprawled on a bunk nearby is LEROY, another black inmate close to Hammond's age. Leroy is leafing through a copy of a skin magazine. He doesn't even look at Cates.

Cates takes the forensic photo out of his pocket, passes it across the table to Hammond. He looks at it, hardly reacts.

<DIRECTION>
He passes the photo back.

(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I got just six months before gettin' out of here. Six months between me and freedom after bein' here three years... And I'm not gonna do anything to screw it up, includin' pee in the prison yard, knock up the Warden's daughter or rat on my old partners...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMMOND>
<DIRECTION>
Cates swings the cell door back open.
</DIRECTION>
<CATES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too bad, Reggie. I thought maybe you were a smart boy. But I guess if you were real smart you wouldn't be a convict.

He turns, goes out. The door clangs behind him. Hammond jumps up and bangs on the bars, shouts at Cates' back...

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hammond moves in only to receive twoquick blows from Cates, a bit sooner than he expected. Cates smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hammond dances in and out... Cates' breathing becomes more labored. His windmill attack penetrates Cates' defense. Cates clears his head, charges, bull-like ... His rush and greater bulk send both of them crashing into some trash cans and a brick wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hammond is faster...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cates is much stronger; Both men on their knees. They look at one another. Silently, they move to their feet. Hammond's back is to a wall... Cates keeps him there, negates the lighter man's agility. They slug away, each now arm-weary... Exchange a dozen blows. Finally, Cates steps back, arms at his side... Breath coming like a bellows...
</DIRECTION>

Hammond has to hold on to the wall; one more punch would put him out.

They stand facing one another. Hammond smiles. A black-and- white comes roaring up the street. Sirens howling, red lights flashing, it slides to a stop. TWO UNIFORMED COPS jump out, guns drawn.

Escalators and open stairwells. Luther enters and pauses by the doorway. Commuters crowd the counters and congregate near the stairwells. More people are seated along hard plastic seats. But no Ganz. And no Billy.

Luther moves further into the station. Cates and Hammond enter. They keep Luther fixed between them, 50 feet ahead. Luther seems to be wandering He walks through the shop area and back toward the escalator. Hammond remains near the arcade while Cates blends in with the commuters. Luther puts the briefcase down at his feet and leans against a counter. Next to him, a loud troop of Boy Scouts marches by. A crowd of people from the train area below flows through the lobby obscuring Luther from Hammond and Cates for a moment. Cates steps out to get a better view and suddenly spots Ganz moving through the crowd toward Luther. Be looks over at Hammond across the station and motions. Then they both start moving in on Ganz, trying to intercept him before he gets deeper into the crowd.

Ganz moves cautiously through the station. A crumpled newspaper held absently in his hand. He scans the faces of the commuters and spots Luther. Fails to notice Cates and Hammond closing in on him from two directions.

He opens his jacket slightly. Reveals a shoulder holster and accompanying .45. A long moment.
</DIRECTION>
<CATES>
	<DIALOGUE>

Roars away...

</ELAINE>
<CATES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATES>
<ELAINE>

	Jack, it's all over the papers. He's an obvious type. But this Indian...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
Hammond cuts in.
</DIRECTION>
<HAMMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was the only one of my bunch that was my friend... He was loyal, went all the way for you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMMOND>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In all due respect, he sounds kind of pathetic to me. The kind of guy that runs home to his momma or some girlfriend. Have you two ace detectives checked that out?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<CATES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, well the only woman of the Indian's we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend. I guess she went with him before she came outta the Closet ... They both looked mad enough to kill him...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATES>
<HAMMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, too bad. They were real nice lookin' too...In bed together, hardly any clothes one watching TV...

</ELAINE>
<CATES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATES>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions. I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<CATES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATES>
<ELAINE>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

</GANZ>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MAIN STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cates comes out of the doorway from which he's fired...and comes into the middle of the street, gun up ... he puts it down when he sees Ganz with Hammond in jeopardy. The hand that's around Hammond's throat also holds the black bag. Cates walks forward, his gun down at his side...
</DIRECTION>
<GANZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	After I get outta this, cop...I'm gonna live forever...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GANZ>
<CATES>

</CATES>
<GANZ>

</GANZ>
<HAMMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMMOND>
<DIRECTION>
Cates still walking...
</DIRECTION>
<GANZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He won't try it. He's a fucking chickenshit cop. They're all fucking wimps, right, Cates?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GANZ>
<DIRECTION>
They are now closer to each other. Ganz holding Hammond and the money...
</DIRECTION>
<GANZ>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, cop ... give me your gun and I'll let him live. Come on, Cates, you're real good at giving up your gun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GANZ>
<DIRECTION>
Cates keeps the same methodical pace...
</DIRECTION>
<CATES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATES>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, he crouches and fires twice. Hammond twists as Ganz also fires. Ganz is hit in the collarbone and driven ten feet backward. His grip on Hammond drops, Hammond dives to the ground, looks at Cates.
</DIRECTION>
<HAMMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus Christ, I didn't think you'd really do it. You are crazy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMMOND>
<DIRECTION>
Ganz' gun still in his hand, but his arm useless at his side. Cates is frozen in the crouch, ready to fire again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ganz is in enormous pain holding his bleeding chest... A look of childish disbelief passes over his face.
</DIRECTION>
<GANZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got hit. I can't believe it. I got shot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GANZ>
<CATES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're done. End of story.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATES>
<GANZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I ain't gonna beg for my life. It ain't cool.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GANZ>
<DIRECTION>
He runs at Cates full-speed, screaming, roaring, then is stopped by two more bullets that tear fist-sized holes in his chest. Cates rises from his crouch. Takes his gun out of Ganz' now lifeless hand. Then goes over to Hammond...
</DIRECTION>
<HAMMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yours?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMMOND>
<DIRECTION>
Cates raises the pistol.
</DIRECTION>
<CATES>

	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMMOND>
<CATES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You did pick a real strange time to go and be brave all on your own...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATES>
<DIRECTION>
Hammond smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<HAMMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just tryin' to get the money, Jack. Just tryin' to build up a few points on that merit system.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMMOND>

	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<CATES>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</CATES>
<ELAINE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<CATES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, bein' a hard-ass all the time is a real drag, but it works.

Cates takes the case to the trunk, opens it, deposits the case, locks the trunk.
</DIRECTION>
<HAMMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a minute, Cates. I've been waitin' three years for that. I don't think it's fair, man. What about the merit system.? You were gonnna give me a few thousand.
