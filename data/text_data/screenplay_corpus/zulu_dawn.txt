</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCRIPT APPEARS ON BLACK SCREEN:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One hundred years ago the British Colony of Natal in Southern Africa was surrounded by a vast and independent Zulu Kingdom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In 1879, a battle took place that was forever to alter the course of colonial history: ISANDHLWANA.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DAWN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Four Zulu's are seen in silhouette herding cattle up a hill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LONG SHOT - Two Zulu's are seen in silhouette high on a precipice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seven Zulu's are seen walking in silhouette against the sunrise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sun fills the screen as the sound of many running feet and Zulu drums are heard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ZULU KRAAL. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A large regiment of Zulu warriors carrying shields and assegais (stabbing spears) are seen running into the Kraal whilst the sound of tribal singing, chanting and drum beating escalates.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside the camp a group of Zulu's are seen grappling with a bull as they struggle to bring the animal to the ground. They are watched by a vast circle of warriors all shouting encouragement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An elaborate tribal dance ensues. It appears to be some sort of Fertility Rite. The females stand opposite the men in rows, chanting as they move in closer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CETSHWAYO, the great Zulu King emerges into the throng. He is tall, beautifully fat, with a big intelligent face and superb dignity. He surveys his subjects with interest as they stand unanimous, thrusting their assegais into the air whilst shouting their allegiance.

SWITCH TO INTERIOR. FRERE is seated at his desk whilst LORD CHELMSFORD is seen in the background standing on the veranda.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Present military system to be abandoned. New regulations concerning the defence of the realm worked out.

CHELMSFORD enters the room, sits and studies two sheets of paper.

<DIRECTION>
Frere continues:
</DIRECTION>
<BARTLE_FRERE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All who do not submit will be dealt with as enemies of the Crown. We will not permit the arbitrary killing and

	<DIALOGUE>
	and unjust oppression which the Zulu people have suffered from their own King Cetshwayo...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARTLE_FRERE>
<DIRECTION>
Pausing, FRERE looks up as if to meet his comrade's gaze. CHELMSFORD, however, continues to read, turning the page.
</DIRECTION>
<BARTLE_FRERE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll see from the letter that this ultimatum is our decision alone. Her Majesty's government seems to prefer a negotiated settlement.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARTLE_FRERE>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP of CHELMSFORD's letter:
</DIRECTION>
<BARTLE_FRERE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Her Majesty's government confidentially hope that by the exercise of prudence and by meeting of the Zulus in a spirit of forbearance and reasonable compromise it will be possible to avert the very serious evil of a war with Cetshwayo.

Return to BARTLE FRERE. As he melts some sealing wax over a silver burner:
</DIRECTION>
<BARTLE_FRERE>
<DIRECTION>
(Referring to the
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	letter he has just
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
completed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does this do what we both know to be right Frederick?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARTLE_FRERE>
<CHELMSFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It does Sir Henry,
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(He folds the papers neatly in half)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	excellently.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHELMSFORD>
<DIRECTION>
The pair exchange glances as BARTLE FRERE applies the wax to his letter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP of stamped seal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CHELMSFORD'S CAMP PIETERMARITZBURG. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Activity everywhere, the incessant movement of an army in the final stages of its formation. Huge ox-wagons are being hauled into the camp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHELMSFORD and CREALOCK are on horseback in full regalia as they ride into the centre of the Camp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Squads of Basuto-infantry -- tall, rangy bodies, naked except for a loincloth and neck ornaments -- are being drilled by foul mouthed, bullying European NCO's.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LT. MELVILL, young, dapper, inspects the Martini Henry rifles of a company of REDCOATS who are lined up near the BASUTOS. A CSM (SGT. WILLIAMS) stalks behind MELVILL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ONE REDCOAT, young, thin, gangling, turns his head slightly to peek at the Basutos, and the swift eye of SGT. WILLIAMS detects the disaffection. The young redcoat (PTE. WILLIAMS) turns, guilty at being caught out of the 'Attention' position. The CSM (SGT. WILLIAMS) leans forward until his face is one inch from that of his quavering prey.
</DIRECTION>
<SGT_WILLIAMS>
<DIRECTION>
(Shouting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You moved.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(With more restraint)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You moved. Go and tell the NCO of that black shambles that you love 'im more than you love me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Shouting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	NOW!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SGT_WILLIAMS>
<DIRECTION>
PTE. WILLIAMS blinks, swallows then runs over to the Basuto's NCO.
</DIRECTION>
<NCO>
<DIRECTION>
(Addressing the Basutos)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not fit to be in the British army you different coloured articles. STRAIGHTEN UP! You're like a load of bloody herd boys!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(He suddenly becomes
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	aware of PTE.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
WILLIAMS' presence)
</DIRECTION>
<PTE_WILLIAMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm to tell you Corporal, that I love you more than my Colour Sergeant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PTE_WILLIAMS>
<DIRECTION>
The Basuto's NCO walks up to PTE. WILLIAMS.
</DIRECTION>
<NCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's frightening... Get out of my bloody sight lad. And put your rifle over your head and double round this field
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(shouting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	until you drop bloody dead. Now move, get on with it, at the double.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NCO>
<DIRECTION>
The Basutos, laughing, raise their shields into the air in general amusement as PRIVATE WILLIAMS runs past.
</DIRECTION>
<NCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up! Get back in the ranks you shower of animals.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NCO>
<DIRECTION>
CHELMSFORD, still on horseback, surveys the encampment. He salutes to SGT. WILLIAMS. CREALOCK, as always, is in attendance.
</DIRECTION>
<SGT_WILLIAMS>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Company Shoulder arms...

<DIRECTION>
(LT. MELVILL joins SGT. WILLIAMS)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Present arms.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SGT_WILLIAMS>
<DIRECTION>
LT. MELVILL turns standing to attention, saluting as CHELMSFORD passes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two BOERS ride into the camp, passing two SUTLERS wagons. We see SGT. WILLIAMS' dismissed COMPANY hurriedly crowding round one of the SUTLER'S wagons, shouting for cigars and gin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two BOERS, one an elderly man, one a boy of sixteen, have dismounted. SGT. WILLIAMS strides over to them.
</DIRECTION>
<SGT_WILLIAMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You passing through?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SGT_WILLIAMS>
<ELDERLY_BOER>

	We aren't at war yet.

(Referring to the boy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bit young 'in he?

</SGT_WILLIAMS>
<ELDERLY_BOER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's my nephew... he can shoot, track and speak Zulu and fight like hell... he's got Assegai marks to prove it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELDERLY_BOER>
<DIRECTION>
He gestures to the boy to show SGT. WILLIAMS. The YOUNG BOER pulls up his shirt, showing an horrendous white scar across his stomach. SGT. WILLIAMS stares in amazement. Coming to, commanding the attention of a BOY-PULLEN in the ranks.
</DIRECTION>
<SGT_WILLIAMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SGT_WILLIAMS>
<BOY_PULLEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir.

SGT. WILLIAMS departs.

<DIRECTION>
(Standing to attention -- Addressing the BOERS)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOY_PULLEN>
<DIRECTION>
The BOERS follow as the PTE. leads off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A TROOP OF SIKALI HORSE under the command of COL. DURNFORD ride into the camp. He is a tall, thin-haired man with handsome sunburnt features, intelligent and sensitive eyes and an over-length moustache. He has only the use of one arm, his left arm being completely paralyzed and held immobile, tucked into a special pocket he has sewn into his tunic. COL. DURNFORD and SGT. MAJOR KAMBULA (A powerful and intelligent African radiating authority) pull up as the troop ride by.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With the SIKALI in the foreground, PTE. WILLIAMS is seen in the background, still running, his rifle above his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The same NCO seen previously addresses the BASUTOS:
</DIRECTION>
<NCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Company... 'Shun!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(The BASUTOS comply)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Move yourselves.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NCO>
<DIRECTION>
SIKALI are seen cantering as if a pre-ordained manoeuvre is about to commence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DURNFORD and S.M. KAMBULA are surveying their troops.
</DIRECTION>
<S_M_KAMBULA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shall I give the order Sir?
	</DIALOGUE>
</S_M_KAMBULA>
<COL_DURNFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright, Sergeant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COL_DURNFORD>
<DIRECTION>
S.M. KAMBULA rides offscreen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SIKALI gather together. S.M. KAMBULA's voice is heard above the throng:
</DIRECTION>
<S_M_KAMBULA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sikali Horse Forward!
	</DIALOGUE>
</S_M_KAMBULA>
<DIRECTION>
The SIKALI ride full pelt, charging at the BASUTOS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The troop continues almost into the first line of the BASUTOS, which consists of their European NCO's.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The European NCO's of the BASUTOS stare at the SIKALI troop as they wheel and once again come galloping at them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COL. PULLEINE, LT. MELVILL & LT. COGHILL are seen outside the Officer's Mess amused at the commotion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP. COL. DURNFORD laughing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The NCO's edge away, unsure, prepared to take to their heels. The BASUTO infantry watch, admiring, clapping.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The troop skillfully turns their horses, as if on a penny, inches from the BASUTO NCO's then ride away, whooping, in high spirits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LORD CHELMSFORD & COL. CREALOCK, having watched this exhibition, ride forward to meet COL. DURNFORD.
</DIRECTION>
<CHELMSFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Splendid horsemanship. Who are they?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHELMSFORD>
<DURNFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sikali Horse, My Lord. Christians all. I know each one by name.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DURNFORD>
<CHELMSFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They come well recommended do they?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHELMSFORD>
<DURNFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My Lord, they rode for me at Bushman's Pass.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DURNFORD>
<CHELMSFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh... indeed. Crealock, we should see that Colonel Durnford has an Officer for his hard riders. Perhaps a subaltern from the Twenty Fourth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHELMSFORD>
<DURNFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought it might be more effective to find someone who speaks Zulu.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DURNFORD>
<DIRECTION>
CHELMSFORD & CREALOCK exchange glances.
</DIRECTION>
<CREALOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. I see you've issued each of them with a Martini Henry Carbine. Our quota for Native contingencies: one rifle to ten men and only five rounds per rifle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREALOCK>
<CHELMSFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But will they make good use of them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHELMSFORD>
<DURNFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're as good marksmen as horsemen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DURNFORD>
<CHELMSFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's no doubting their horsemanship Colonel Durnford.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHELMSFORD>
<DIRECTION>
CHELMSFORD & DURNFORD salute.
</DIRECTION>
<DURNFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Crealock.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DURNFORD>
<DIRECTION>
CREALOCK nods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DURNFORD exits offscreen.
</DIRECTION>
<CHELMSFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We must think how to make best use of Colonel Durnford's African knowledge.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHELMSFORD>
<DIRECTION>
Through the smoke of the field kitchens enters the Honourable WILLIAM VEREKER, aristocratically aloof on a fine stallion, his servant following on an equally fine horse. He rides purposely towards COL. DURNFORD as if he has been seeking him.
</DIRECTION>
<VEREKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Colonel Durnford... William Vereker. I hear you've been seeking Officers?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VEREKER>
<DURNFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good ones, yes, Mr Vereker. Gentlemen who can ride and shoot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DURNFORD>
<DIRECTION>
DURNFORD waits for a reaction. VEREKER, cool, looks into DURNFORD's face and takes out his rifle. Cantering some distance away, VEREKER turns, spurs his horse vigorously and, on reaching DURNFORD, throws his rifle up into the aim. He fires one-handed at the half carcass of a cow being hung up near the field kitchens without veering his galloping horse. The half carcass shudders under the impact of the heavy bullet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PTE. WILLIAMS has been jogging wretchedly on. On hearing the bullet he throws himself to the ground believing he has been shot. Two of the kitchen hands help him to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP of SGT. WILLIAMS.
</DIRECTION>
<SGT_WILLIAMS>
<DIRECTION>
(Shouting across the field)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Private Williams. You've stopped.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SGT_WILLIAMS>
<DIRECTION>
PTE. WILLIAMS regains his composure and, once more lifting his rifle above his head, continues to jog. SGT. WILLIAMS looks on with smug satisfaction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As VEREKER approaches, DURNFORD commands the attention of LT. RAW.
</DIRECTION>
<DURNFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Raw. Take Mr. Vereker to the Store and see he's issued the necessary equipment. And then show him to the Mess and explain to him how an Officer is expected to behave.

RAW salutes and leads VEREKER off left, as DURNFORD watches their departure.

INT. OFFICERS' MESS TENT. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP. A scorpion is being removed from a specimen jar with a pair of tweezers. It is lifted out of shot to be examined under a magnifying glass revealing LIEUTENANTS COGHILL & MELVILL seated at an impressive green baize table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There are African servants, white-jacketed. SERGEANT MURPHY, a short, broad humorous, coarse-faced man, supervises the servants.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHELMSFORD sits alone at a corner table reading his newspaper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Other Officers are seated around the main table drinking claret and smoking the obligatory cigars. COLONEL PULLEINE is writing a letter whilst LT. HARFORD sits with his tins around him classifying his specimens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As SGT. MURPHY refills their glasses COGHILL & MELVILL gossip covertly in half whispers so that their voices don't carry to the table of their commander.
</DIRECTION>
<MELVILL>
<DIRECTION>
(Lighting COGHILL'S cigar)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our good Colonel Durnford scored quite a coup with the Sikali Horse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELVILL>
<COGHILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Um. There are rumours that my Lord Chelmsford intends to make Durnford Second in Command.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COGHILL>
<MELVILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well that's typical of Her Majesty's army. Appoint an engineer to do a soldier's work.

</MELVILL>
<PULLEINE>
<DIRECTION>
(He continues writing without looking up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, now Mr. Melvill, less of your spleen.

<DIRECTION>
COGHILL & MELVILL smile at one another before their attention is drawn to LT. RAW and VEREKER entering the Mess.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pleased you could join us.

</CHELMSFORD>
<DIRECTION>
The OFFICERS turn, a bit startled, to look at this newcomer who is somehow on first-name terms with the Lord General.
</DIRECTION>
<VEREKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was either that, or join the Zulu.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VEREKER>
<CHELMSFORD>
<DIRECTION>
(Removing his glasses)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Join the Zulu? Oh yes, you're right in the thick of it aren't you? Talked to your father before we sailed... he said you'd taken to farming near Zulu land. Sent his regards... Should I meet up with you.

HARFORD raises a glass jar containing one of his prized specimens in acknowledgement. Meanwhile MURPHY has collected a bottle of claret from a tray brought by another black servant. He pours the contents into the trophy.

<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't leave your gin around, Vereker, or Harford will have it full of preserved butterflies. A damned waste, if you ask me.

HARFORD chuckles as he replaces the lid on his jar.

	Oh, I doubt if I'll leave much of that around. There's quite a shortage where I've been.

A tall, bald imposing Zulu named MANTSHONGA enters the camp. He makes his way through a large regiment of young Zulu braves and older INDUNAS (officers). They surround two young Zulu warriors who are tautly circling. Their shields are held at the defensive, their assegais poised for underhand thrust.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - The two warriors fighting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LONG SHOT - The vast crowd encircling the warriors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd cheers as CHIEF CETSHWAYO watches from his throne.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MANTSHONGA, spotting CETSHWAYO, walks purposefully towards him.
</DIRECTION>
<MANTSHONGA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I bring greetings from your friends, the British, and from the Great Lord Chelmsford.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MANTSHONGA>
<CETSHWAYO>
<DIRECTION>
(Still watching the fighting Zulus)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what do your Masters say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CETSHWAYO>
<MANTSHONGA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They are angry and send these demands. They say you rule in old ways that are wrong, that you kill your people without trial. The Great White Queen herself cannot kill her lowliest subject though she rules forty lands, each greater than all of Zululand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MANTSHONGA>
<BAYELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kill the Traitor, Father!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAYELE>
<CETSHWAYO>
<DIRECTION>
(Gesturing to his son to calm down)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do kill, under the customs of the Zulu, and I shall not depart from that. Do I go to the country of the white man and tell him to change his laws and customs?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CETSHWAYO>
<MANTSHONGA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The British say your armies grow larger and they demand that you disband your Impis of War.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MANTSHONGA>
<CETSHWAYO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell the British I will not cross the river which divides our lands. But ask Lord Chelmsford if he would disarm his warriors in the face of such threats.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CETSHWAYO>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP. The two Zulus are now in ferocious combat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SWITCH back to alternate CLOSE shots of CETSHWAYO & MANTSHONGA.
</DIRECTION>
<MANTSHONGA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will ask him, but his answer will be to start war against your 30,000 warriors.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MANTSHONGA>
<CETSHWAYO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My armies will defend this land.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CETSHWAYO>
<DIRECTION>
General uproar as one of the fighting Zulus falls to the ground. Standing, CETSHWAYO gives the signal to kill. The triumphant Zulu drives his assegai into the other's heart. A group of warriors converge upon the body as MANTSHONGA turns and EXITS.

<DIRECTION>
There is a steady advance up the hill. The Zulus turn, scrambling through the undergrowth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SIKALI approach. One of the Zulus turns and stands his ground. He thrusts his assegai at his foe dismounting the SIKALI from his horse. In a second the Zulu jumps astride the horse but his escape is prevented by an offending shot from another SIKALI.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
More SIKALI advance. They bring down several more Zulus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A group of four Zulus converge on one SIKALI. They pull him off his horse into a crop of rocks. One Zulu manages to mount the horse and rides away encouraged by the others.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VEREKER notices this. Slowly and deliberately he removes his rifle from his saddle, takes aim and then fires. The dead warrior falls to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A group of LANCERS track one ZULU. The lead LANCER approaches, guiding his horse expertly. He feints with the downstroke of his lance.

The ZULU lowers his shield.

The LANCER, on the ZULU now, uses the up-stroke to impale the ZULU to a tree.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. ZULULAND EAST OF ISANDHLWANA. HOT SUNNY DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FANNIN, a short, fat English settler, in his thirties, gross- featured, rides sleepily over sloping terrain. Behind him, on foot, several black African retainers follow desultorily. FANNIN snorts, sweats, appears generally fat and unhealthy. He halts his horse and removes a bottle from his saddlebag. He takes a large swig from the remaining liquid and discards the bottle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FANNIN reaches the top of an animal track at the top of a ridge. Looking down he spots several ZULUS herding a small group of cattle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ZULUS shout calls of alarm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Turning around to give orders to his retainers, FANNIN spots them scrambling down the slope away from the ZULUS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As FANNIN returns to face front, he gapes as he notices that the valley is black with ZULU IMPIS. They are run-marching towards the west. No noise save the disciplined swish of thousands of feet in the dust.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FANNIN hesitates, realizes he's been spotted, quickly, cruelly jerks his horse's head round and spurs over the ridge into the next valley.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UHAMA calls out and MBILINI, BAYELE & another, with UHAMA, sprint up the ridge in pursuit of FANNIN. As they mount the crest, they see FANNIN belting down the far side in search of safety. UHAMA stops the other three momentarily from continuing the chase.
</DIRECTION>
<UHAMA>

	Follow the white Man, let him see you. He will lead you to the soldiers. Then, let the white Soldiers take you. When they think they have broken you, tell them that the Impis are in the East.

FANNIN peers about. Huge pistol in his hand, he spots MBILINI and fires.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MBILINI 'dies' dramatically, but when FANNIN rides on, MBILINI comes to life, grinning and joins the others to track FANNIN.

VEREKER and SIKALI appear beyond the next ridge. Spotting FANNIN, VEREKER gives the signal to advance.

VEREKER looks down the slope at the three Zulus who have now been apprehended by the SIKALI. FANNIN drinks again. His avid, greedy behaviour does not enamour his rescuers.

	Why did they attack you?

PULLEINE is seated at a table outside his tent. He is smoking and studying a document as SGT. MURPHY pours red wine into his tankard. VEREKER crosses in front of the table.

<ELDERLY_BOER>

<PULLEINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did they say?

</PULLEINE>
<VEREKER>

<PULLEINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you believe that?

BLACKNESS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PTE. WILLIAMS is on sentry-go. There are men seated around a camp fire, PTE. STOREY sits on the back of a wagon, smoking. PTE. WILLIAMS stares into the black night. Insect noises, a horse neighs. He hears something more alarming. His eyes widen, his grip on his rifle tightens. He listens again. He moves to the front of the wagon, convinced he has heard something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Returning to the rear he addresses STOREY.

DURNFORD'S ARRIVAL AT ISANDHLWANA. 22ND, JANUARY. 11:00AM

<DIRECTION>
DURNFORD'S COLUMN pounds down the slope into the camp. It is welcomed with relief, tension everywhere relaxes and smiles are seen. There is calling and greeting between the forces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AREA BETWEEN WAGONS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BAYELE and the OTHER ZULU CAPTIVE held for questioning are tied up to wagons in an area somewhat screened from the camp. MBILINI is on the ground, his feet and hands are bound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO SENTRIES guard them. MBILINI lies almost unconscious, tongue lolling, from the ropes that bind him. Evidence of the beating he has undergone is extensive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The TWO REDCOAT SENTRIES run forward to see DURNFORD'S COLUMN arrive, momentarily leaving the captives.

The TWO SENTRIES turn. One addresses the other:
</DIRECTION>
<SENTRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll fix 'im, Serg'.

He starts to walk back to the wagons. BAYELE continues to shout.

<SENTRY>

<DIRECTION>
(He reaches the wagons)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you 'ear me? Shut up!

</SENTRY>
<DIRECTION>
As he passes MBILINI on the ground, the warrior thrusts his trussed legs between the SENTRY'S legs. The SENTRY stumbles to the ground, his head near BAYELE'S feet. He immediately starts to rise but before he can, BAYELE has lifted his powerful foreleg waist high in stamping position and brings it down with a sickening crunch onto the SENTRY'S lower neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now all is desperate speed. Under BAYELE'S directions, MBILINI stretches to the unconscious SENTRY and manages to take his bayonet with his bound feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERCUT WITH SHOTS OF DURNFORD'S ARRIVAL IN CAMP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cutting the ropes about his neck, MBILINI succeeds in rising to his feet, managing to get the bayonet blade to BAYELE'S bonds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Between them the first ropes are cut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As BAYELE'S hands are freed, the SENTRY on the ground starts to regain consciousness. Taking the bayonet from MBILINI, BAYELE thrusts the weapon into the SENTRY'S back killing him. He removes the bayonet from the SENTRY'S body and also takes a knife from the redcoat's scabbard which he hands to MBILINI. Together they free the third Zulu tied to the other wagon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Making their escape, they edge beyond the wagons. Crouching low, they run up the slope and head for the North.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But all British eyes are to the East or on DURNFORD'S column.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DURNFORD dismounts, takes in the encampment.

(Sitting beside him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm doing notes for my dispatch and I need to clear up a few military points. I don't want to bother His Lordship. Had it drummed into my thick skull that a good Commander never willingly splits his forces, especially in an enemy's country before knowing their dispositions.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NOGGS>
<DIRECTION>
CREALOCK has continued to sketch throughout Noggs' banter.
</DIRECTION>
<CREALOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, Yes, if we were facing a European enemy armed with guns I think your point would hold, Noggs. Further, may I remind you I do not create the strategies you wish to comment on. I am only his Lordship's Secretary.

<DIRECTION>
(He gives NOOGS a smug smile)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a slight chuckle he leans closer to CREALOCK.

<NOGGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wouldn't take overly comfort from that Crealock old fellah because if he sinks, then you sink with him.

VEREKER, S.M. KAMBULA, OFFICERS and a troop of SIKALI horse ride out of camp into the foreground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PANS the vast African countryside. VEREKER'S column is seen in the distance. CAMERA stops to reveal a ZULU SCOUT in the foreground. He is hidden by a tree. On spying the soldiers, he turns to two young ZULU BOYS behind him. He shouts instructions that they draw attention to themselves by moving their herd of cattle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DURNFORD, now with KAMBULA, reaches the top of a rise. He stops and KAMBULA hands him a pair of binoculars. Surveying the land he spots VEREKER'S column. Handing the binoculars back to KAMBULA, he spurs his horse onward.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sikali forward!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VEREKER>
<DIRECTION>
Kicking their horses and whooping, the soldiers give chase. The ZULUS try to flee but in vain. One soldier, TROOPER JAMES, aims his rifle at one of the ZULUS and fires. VEREKER, hearing the shot, rides towards TROOPER JAMES, but stops when he gets to the ZULU BOY who is lying motionless on the ground. Dismounting, VEREKER goes over to the body and looks down at the dead boy with compassion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TROOPER JAMES spurs to the lip, exultant, keen to kill. He reins his horse abruptly. Holding it still, he stares at the valley before him. Suddenly all energy leaves his body. He stares in disbelief. LT. RAW is beside him.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES>

<DIRECTION>
More and more Zulus mount the crest coming into formation. The troopers are amazed at the sheer weight of enemy number.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VEREKER'S troop fire volleys steadily, the Zulus now six hundred yards away. Some Zulus fall but the mass, getting into disciplined ranks, advance implacably towards them.

RUSSELL fights bravely, as do his troop. It is a few dozen men against hundreds. They are inundated by the ZULU tide, which is not checked. Several ZULU fall, but RUSSELL and his troop are simply overcome and vanish as the LEFT HORN continues on its way hence, threatening to cut Durnford's column off from the camp.

<DIRECTION>
The companies wheel about to race back to the relative security of a nearby donga.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is sudden turmoil as a group of ZULUS hurtle over the lower edge of the donga. A fierce hand-to-hand, assegai against bayonet battle ensues as warrior after warrior rises from cover to come over the edge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DURNFORD rides to make sure that firing against the rear line of ZULUS is maintained to prevent it too from coming forward, to secure the temporary breech.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOLDIERS of CAVAYE'S COMPANY have withdrawn to the camp periphery and now fire in line with MOSTYN'S COMPANY, volley after steady volley.

BOY-PULLEN stands at the front of the queue. He is handing out one box of ammunition at a time to each soldier.

A NATAL NATIVE reaches the head of the queue. As BOY-PULLEN goes to hand him some ammunition, BLOOMFIELD looks up and strides forward.

EXT. BATTLEFIELD. ISANDHLWANA. DAY

<DIRECTION>
VEREKER gallops hard as do his troop of BASUTO HORSEMEN. CAMERA TRACKS FORWARD, following them to the donga which DURNFORD'S COMPANIES are defending. Horses are in the donga. The troops are firing from the outer lip of the donga. VEREKER'S MEN provide the much needed backup.

<DURNFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Move the horses!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DURNFORD>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON DURNFORD. He signals the next tactic as he rides across the donga. Commands are issued down the line. The men now disengage and run in the opposite direction from the ZULUS, leaping into the donga to find their horses and swinging onto saddles to scramble up the far side, galloping 400 yards close to the camp to form a new defence line.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"The Retreat" is sounded. There is hand-to-hand, bayonets, spears, hunting knives and ZULUS trying to assegai the horses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A handful of REDCOATS await the ZULU as they clamber over the ridge. Realization of the vast Zulu numbers suddenly dawns as their NCO shouts in desperation:
</DIRECTION>
<NCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take the high ground!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NCO>
<DIRECTION>
The REDCOATS are completely overwhelmed and are soon lost amidst the ZULU onslaught.

	Speed up the ammunition flow, Vereker. I'll try to hold the road to Rorke's Drift.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DURNFORD>

<DIRECTION>
SGT. WILLIAMS' MEN are under serious attack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ZULUS are among the NATAL NATIVES, stabbing, stabbing, stabbing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ZULU LOIN is sitting some three hundred yards from the battle, facing away from it. The ZULU LOIN, two IMPIS of seasoned warriors, start to run towards the gap through which the NATAL NATIVES, ZULUS and SMITH'S GUNS are streaming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Both lines of REDCOATS are attacked from the back, and the lines try to fight enemy in front and behind.

<SGT_WILLIAMS>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</SGT_WILLIAMS>
<DIRECTION>
SGT. WILLIAMS grabs a passing ZULU by the throat. He throws him to the ground and beats him to death. Reaching the top of a ridge, he bayonets a ZULU scrambling up the ridge towards him. Withdrawing the blade, he turns just in time to bayonet another ZULU attacking from the rear.

</SGT_WILLIAMS>
<DIRECTION>
At this point SGT. WILLIAMS falls to his knees. He has been assegaied in the back. PTE. WILLIAMS thrusts his bayonet over SGT. WILLIAMS head, killing the offending ZULU. He turns and bayonets another running towards him.
</DIRECTION>
<SGT_WILLIAMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Behind you, lad! Ah no...

Both Sergeant and Private die together.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE IN on BAYELE as he leads the ZULUS onward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA FOLLOWS THREE SIKALI HORSEMEN as they gallop towards BLOOMFIELD'S ammunition wagon. Another GROUP OF REDCOATS surrounds the wagon. BLOOMFIELD and BOY-PULLEN serve them with ammunition which is fired with discipline at a rapid rate.

LONG SHOT of the ZULUS streaming across the plain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Many of the REDCOATS have turned and are running for their lives. The battleground is awash with red tunics. As the CAMERA passes over the dead, one body suddenly leaps to his feet. It is PTE. STOREY. He has been playing 'dead'. Running, he makes for cover beneath a wagon. He searches beyond the mass of ZULUS for a target. He sees the distant INDUNAS, he aims carefully and fires.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STOREY, satisfied with the result, now kneels to the corpse of a fallen man beside him. He finds LT. CAVAYE dead. He bends to search him for ammunition. STOREY finds one cartridge, spitting on it for luck, he loads, aims and fires.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A huge line of ZULUS run forward and engulf him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP of STOREY'S torso beneath the wagon. An assegai protrudes from his chest.

They are only ten yards away when there is a massive explosion. The wagon has burst into flames and the ammunition continues to explode.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP of BLOOMFIELD. He is lying face down on the ground in a state of shock. He slowly turns his head and we see the bloody corpse of BOY-PULLEN. BLOOMFIELD'S face grimaces as he is stabbed in the back by an unseen assailant. His face falls into the dirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PULLEINE'S H.Q. TENT. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULLEINE is sitting inside his tent. He is writing a letter to his wife. There is a pistol on the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BAYELE enters the tent. PULLEINE immediately picks up his pistol and aims at BAYELE. There is a moment's hesitation from both.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULLEINE drops his pistol to one side inviting BAYELE to kill him. BAYELE seizes the moment and with one forward fatal thrust, stabs PULLEINE in the heart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULLEINE slumps onto the desk as BAYELE leaves without remorse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LONG PAN SHOT of MELVILL & COGHILL as they take the Colours out of the camp.

HIGH VIEW. DURNFORD'S South-East defence position. ZOOM forward to show the first refugees behind from the camp breaking out on the South, crossing into the ravine; their line of exit the same as the guns, defended by DURNFORD'S troops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP of DURNFORD. He loads his pistol and turning full circle, realizes that he and his troops are surrounded. Jumping up onto an ammunition wagon, he starts to target the approaching ZULUS, now only ten yards away. He uses all six shots, throws his pistol to one side and picks up a discarded assegai from the wagon. As he frantically tries to batter a ZULU warrior, another ZULU aims a rifle straight at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a single shot. DURNFORD, clasping the shoulder of his disabled left arm, falls off the ammuntion wagon and tumbles down the ravine, landing at the bottom with a painful thud. Out of breath, he struggles to sit upright, his back against the muddy bank of the ravine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A ZULU appears at the top of the ravine. Standing on top of the ammunition wagon, he throws his assegai down at the body below. It finds it's target, piercing DURNFORD in the chest. Short of breath, he makes a vain attempt at removing the weapon but his efforts are futile. He draws his last breath and dies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FUGITIVE'S RAVINE. DAY
</DIRECTION>

EXT. RIVER BANK OPPOSITE RORKE'S DRIFT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COGHILL, MELVILL & VEREKER urge their horses onward, galloping into the river.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Several ZULUS remain on the bank, shooting rifles and throwing assegais into the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One ZULU jumps into the water and attempts to swim after them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VEREKER is the first to reach the opposite bank. The other two have become separated from their horses. VEREKER'S is close by. Scrambling up the bank, VEREKER turns to COGHILL & MELVILL who are still in the water.

	<DIALOGUE>
	For God's sake, hold them back! I'll get the horses.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VEREKER>
<DIRECTION>
COGHILL is the next to reach the bank. He turns back to MELVILL who is struggling in the water with the Colours.
</DIRECTION>
<COGHILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's alright It's alright.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COGHILL>
<DIRECTION>
He helps MELVILL up onto the bank as VEREKER mounts his horse. VEREKER rides off in pursuit of the other two horses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a single rifle shot, which brings VEREKER'S horse to the ground. In the background we see a vast number of ZULUS engulf COGHILL & MELVILL. MELVILL attempts to fight with his sword but he is overwhelmed. There is an awful piercing scream and the two men disappear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERCUT BETWEEN VEREKER & GROUP OF ZULUS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VEREKER lies on the ground, his left leg trapped beneath the body of his horse. He sees the ZULUS take up the Colours as they run up to the high ground, revealing COGHILL & MELVILL'S dead bodies in the FOREGROUND.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VEREKER is breathing uneasily. He watches with amazement as the ZULUS hold the Colours aloft mockingly. Some ZULUS are wearing their purloined Redcoat uniforms, they whoop and wail exultantly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VEREKER takes his time. He aims his rifle at the ZULU carrying the Colours.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shot kills the ZULU and the Colours fall (SLOW MOTION) down, down into the river.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Relieved, VEREKER'S head falls to the sandy bank.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Colours float into CLOSE UP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PULLEINE'S CAMP. ISANDHLWANA. DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHELMSFORD and his ESCORT ride into the camp. The air is full of smoke and the crackling of fire can still be heard. A dead soldier who has been tied to a post and disembowelled is CENTRE SCREEN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wind begins to howl as CAMERA follows CHELMSFORD into the centre of the camp. He dismounts. Very slowly he removes his helmet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP of HARFORD. A solitary tear trickles down his cheek as he surveys the area with disbelief.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stationary, CHELMSFORD looks around him. Then very slowly and deliberately he walks forward towards the CAMERA.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PANS to reveal CREALOCK, still on horseback, in the background. He rides into focus.
</DIRECTION>
<CREALOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me, My Lord, there's something I must convey to you. I rode a little way along the track to Rorke's Drift. The sky above is red with fire.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your Orders, My Lord? Do we move to the Drift?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREALOCK>
<DIRECTION>
CHELMSFORD does not answer. He continues to walk forward, expressionless.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT CLOSE UP. CHELMSFORD lowers his head, his eyes still front.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CROSS FADE to blood red sunset. Script is superimposed:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Battle of Isandhlwana was recorded in history as the worst defeat ever inflicted on a modern army by native troops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In Parliament, upon the downfall of his government, British Prime Minister, Benjamin Disraeli, asked the question:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"Who are these Zulus, who are these remarkable people who defeat our generals, convert our bishops and who on this day have put an end to a great dynasty?"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ZULU singing and chanting crescendos.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
