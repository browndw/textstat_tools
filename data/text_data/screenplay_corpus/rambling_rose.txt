EXT. DELTA TERMINAL - KENNEDY AIRPORT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On a taxi arriving at the Delta terminal of Kennedy Airport. A man in a well-tailored gray suit gets out of the taxi.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO a CLOSER SHOT of the man as he pays the cabbie. He is WILLCOX HILLYER, the middle-aged "Buddy" of this story and the observer through whose eyes it is seen. He has a dry, ironic, rather agreeable manner and he should seem like everyone's idea of a successful author, a slightly graying, trim, still-youthful-looking fifty. The CAMERA follows him as he walks into the terminal carrying a small travel bag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DELTA TERMINAL - KENNEDY AIRPORT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO a shot of Willcox Hillyer at a counter getting his ticket processed. A little smile is on his face as he talks to a pretty airline girl. This character likes girls; his aloofness is modified, his face changes when he talks to them. The airline girl smiles back, she finds him attractive. We don't hear what they are saying, no dialogue on track -- it is obvious he is flirting with the girl in a mild way, but now a frown comes on his face and he turns his head as if slightly annoyed by something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO a POV shot of a tall, gaunt, almost totally bald man at the next ticket counter. The man is about sixty-five and looks like a half senile Great Dane. He is DAVE WILKIE, erstwhile husband of the heroine of this story. Age has not been at all kind to Dave; his face is lined with bitterness, he is a sour, angry, lonely man and now he is making a very unpleasant scene with a ticket girl and an airline representative, waving his ticket and gesticulating angrily. He wears an expensive, ill-fitting suit and a Texas-type hat. We don't hear his angry complaints, no dialogue is on the track.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT BACK to a CLOSE SHOT of Willcox Hillyer as he stares with a frown at the man. It's as if he knows the man but can't place him. The airline ticket girl speaks to him and he turns back to her, his face softening as he answers her, obviously saying he'll carry his bag. He nods goodbye to the girl, turns and the CAMERA follows him as he walks some distance away and stops, looks back with another pensive frown at the tall, gaunt man at the next counter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO ANOTHER POV shot of Dave Wilkie, a longer shot than the first. The man is now arguing angrily with two airline representatives, still waving his ticket and shaking his head. We don't hear him. Lip-readers might pick up what he is saying: "I'm supposed to be in first class, not tourist. What's the matter with this friggin' airline?"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT BACK TO Willcox Hillyer, a CLOSE SHOT of his face as he rubs his chin and frowns obviously struggling to remember the man. The CAMERA holds on him as he stares at the gaunt angry Dave, racking his brain. He shakes his head, he cannot place the man and yet he knows him. The CAMERA moves in closer on Willcox Hillyer's face as he stares in pensive puzzlement at this ghost from the past and now we hear, as if from a distance, FAINT MUSIC on the track -- it is "Dixie," played with beautiful lazy mocking love by the great Louis Armstrong in his prime. At first we can barely hear it, then the MUSIC becomes LOUDER as Hillyer's frown deepens and he seems almost to know the man.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see him entering the departure lounge and boarding the plane.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DELTA AIRPLANE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A shot of him as he smiles rather nicely at a very attractive young stewardess as he walks down the aisle of the plane. He is not a crass or lewd flirt, but life comes into his face when he sees a pretty girl -- he seems to have a real affection for girls: toward men he is polite but rather dry and ironic, almost aloof, but girls he likes. We see him sit in a seat, open his travel bag and take out long galley sheets. He stares for a moment rather wearily at the galleys, then sighs, puts on reading glasses and begins to make corrections as boarding passengers walk by in the aisle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Something or someone disturbs him, he looks up with a slight frown and CUT TO a POV shot of Dave Wilkie, all wonder and enthusiasm. This OVER the TITLES and we do not hear the dialogue they speak, what we heard is LOUIS ARMSTRONG, but I will put the dialogue in here so the actors can act it. We do not want to hear it, the sense of what they are saying will be obvious from the acting.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO Dave and Willcox Hillyer as the young stewardess gives them drinks. Dave bestows a sour glance on her when he sees the single drink, but at the moment he is in the midst of an aggressively self-satisfied conversation and says nothing to her. He speaks to Hillyer, who is making a real effort to be polite but is less than happy about the encounter.

Dave Wilkie's eyes narrow with vindictive anger as he says it and one can well believe the streak of raw violence in the man. It is frightening even now; he is a clown, but he is a dangerous clown. As his long, bitter, impassioned tirade continues, Willcox Hillyer becomes increasingly tense and pale -- it is obvious he detests what the man is saying and he is struggling to control himself.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - DRIVEWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO a LONG POV shot of a young and very pretty blonde girl walking slowly up an oak-shaded driveway. A ZOOMAR LENSE takes us TOWARD her. She is carrying a cardboard suitcase tied with a string. Her clothes are cheap, her shoes are dusty, runs are in her stockings. She is sweaty, tired and seems very nervous. ROSE is a very attractive girl, but her primary quality is not sexiness, but an innocence and sweetness. She pauses to wipe sweat from her forehead with the back of her hand and nervously moistens her lips as she stares ahead uncertainly at the "nice" Southern home which to her seems very grand. It is apparent she is badly frightened and apprehensive about what lies ahead. She is also exhausted from the heat and a long hot walk in the Southern sun. She blinks at perspiration, swallows in anxiety again and forces herself to walk on.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - PORCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO a shot of Buddy on the porch. Expressionless, unreadable, neither friendly nor hostile, he stares with an even gaze directly into the CAMERA. He has his hands on his hips in a distinctive way that we will later see is a mannerism of his father's. Buddy tries to imitate the style of his father, not always with complete success. Unreadable as a Sphinx, he stands there, waiting.

CUT TO a POV shot of Rose at the foot of the porch steps. A tentative little smile is on her face. It is very plain she is nervous and frightened.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello. I'm Rose, and I've come to live with you and your family.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. The damn boy says nothing. A trifle crestfallen, Rose moistens his lips and swallows. She ventures another little smile and the CAMERA follows her as she walks up the steps. The at-times-insufferable Buddy comes into the shot. He still has his hands on his hips Daddy-style and his expression is inscrutable, neither friendly nor hostile.

INT. HILLYER HOME BEDROOM STUDY - DAY

<DIRECTION>
CUT TO a shot of Buddy's mother, Mrs. Hillyer, in a Morris chair in her bedroom study.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOTHER is a sensitive, kind and rather appealing if slightly eccentric lady of about 37 or 38. She wears glasses, has a Victorian hairdo and a 1930ish style dress. At the moment Mother is absorbed in her studies -- notebooks and history books are littered and piled everywhere around her chair. She is drinking a Coca-Cola and smoking a cigarette held by a bobbie pin. Calmly, she glances up as Buddy enters the room. The CAMERA pulls back to include him.

<MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wonderful. What's she like, Brother? What is your impression of her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTHER>
<BUDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She talks a great deal and smiles a lot. She's very pretty, she has a real good figure. She's very girlish or womanish, if you know what I mean. She wouldn't hurt anybody, this girl. She couldn't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUDDY>
<DIRECTION>
Mother accepts her son's precocious pronouncement as perfectly normal; talks to him as if he's an adult.
</DIRECTION>
<MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your impression is very reassuring, Brother. Of course she's had troubles, poor thing, but I sensed that was that the girl was like and I'm glad to have it reconfirmed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTHER>
<BUDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean confirmed, Mother. I didn't confirm it before. I would have had to confirm it previously, in order for it to be reconfirmed.

	All right, all right. Doll and Waski are upstairs taking their nap, you go get them and bring them down to the living room. Where is the girl?

INT. HILLYER HOME - LIVING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A shot of Mother, Rose, Buddy, Doll and Waski in the living room of the Hillyer household. DOLL is a pretty little girl of about 11, WASKI a boy of 5. Mother's tone is very gentle, very sweet, very kind. Her unabashed admiration for her own children has an ingenuousness that is more amusing than offensive.
</DIRECTION>
<MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rose, this is Waski. His real name is Warren but we call him Waski. He doesn't like it much and I suppose someday we'll have to stop calling him that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTHER>
<WASKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can stop it right now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WASKI>
<MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When he was baby we called him "Wa Wa," a baby name, you know. You will find him a very good boy. His brother can be bad and so can his sister, but Waski is a very good boy. And as you can see he's beautiful.
	</DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	There are plenty of girls who would give thousands of dollars to have your auburn hair. Beauty is beauty and that's all there is to it. Beauty is there and we have to recognize it. Now Rose, the little girl sitting across from you with the blue eyes is Doll Baby. She looks like an angel and she is an angel, but she can be a naughty angel sometimes, although her father won't believe it. Her real name is Frances, but we call her Dolly or Doll.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTHER>
<DOLL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't like that, either, it's worse than Waski. I want to be called Fran.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOLL>
<MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Daddy wouldn't hear that. Now the redhaired boy you see sitting there, of course you have met him, he is my oldest son and my most brilliant child. All children have great creative powers, but I don't want to rattle on about my children, they say I brag too much about them, especially about Brother. Am I boring you, Rose?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTHER>
<DIRECTION>
Rose has not as yet caught on to Mother's style and is staring at her with lips apart and blue eyes slightly popped.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
(feebly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, no, ma'am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>
<MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it's rather interesting about Brother, actually. I realized the remarkable thing he had when he was six weeks old. He looked at me and understood me, he knew exactly who I was. I know it sounds crazy but it's true. He's very remarkable, he was born for the ministry and could move millions, but he doesn't know that yet. I have to warn you about him, he can be very dangerous, there is an evil streak in him, a streak of pure sheer meanness. But at heart Brother is saintly and that is why he was born for the ministry even if he doesn't know it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTHER>
<DIRECTION>
Thus, Mother. Slightly cuckoo, a bit out of touch with reality, but no fool. A very intelligent woman really, and very, very gentle and kind. Her style, however, takes a little getting used to and her long speech throws Rose completely. She stares at Mother in speechless open-mouthed awe, unable to say a word.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA moves in CLOSER on Rose as she moistens her lips, swallows, tries to talk and can't. She is very, very nervous. Now she flinches and looks around as we hear a deep masculine VOICE OVER the shot. It is the voice of DADDY, Mr. Hillyer, Buddy's father.
</DIRECTION>
<DADDY_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honey, you'll scare the gizzard out of the girl going into the fourth dimension like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DADDY_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE on Daddy in the doorway of the living room. He is a handsome man of about forty with a style and a manner all his own. As extravagant as his remarks often are and funny though he is at times, the man has a courtly Southern dignity that is never lost. He is no clown, he is not even a comedian, he is a man and a formidable man at that: all the characters in this story love and fear him. We see now where Buddy got his unreadable expression thing and his hands on the hips thing. Daddy is unreadable. A straw hat is on the back of his head, a rolled-up Glenville Tribune is in his hand, his hands are on his hips. He is staring with what seems to be stern fierceness at them all, but his attitude really is inscrutable.
</DIRECTION>
<MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It isn't the fourth dimension. To you it's the fourth dimension, maybe, to me it's simply the truth.
	</DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, well, well. So Miss Rosebud has arrived. Un-hmm. And you're all assembled here. Yes, indeed. Un hmmm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DADDY>
<DIRECTION>
Daddy walks in as Rose stares wide-eyed at him. It is obvious he scares the absolute bejesus out of her, she looks actually as if she might faint, her hands trembling on her lap and her knees quivering beneath her cheap and tacky dress. But she has a surprise coming. She is soon to lose all her fear of him, every bit of it. Daddy walks over and sits in a chair beside her, stares fiercely at her for a moment, then begins a long speech. Again, extravagant as this speech is, he is no clown, he is not "being funny," he means every word he says.
</DIRECTION>
<DADDY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Rosebud, now you are here, darling, and I swear to God graceful as the capital letter S. You will adorn our house, Rosebud, you will give a glow and a shine to these old walls. If there's one thing I like to have around, it's a frizzy-haired blonde. Now I assume Mrs. Hillyer and the children have introduced themselves and made your acquaintance, and so forth and so on?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DADDY>

Rose can barely answer, eyes fixed in rapt fascination on him, a half whisper.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>
<DADDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right. Now as head of this household I have a couple of remarks to make. It is my dear wife's belief, which I accept although I do not totally grasp it, that to hire a person to do household work is a criminal practice. Therefore, you are here not as a servant, you are here as a friend, as a guest and hopefully as a member of this family. You will eat your meals with us, you will share life itself with us -- in love and harmony, dear Rosebud, in love and harmony. Do you understand me?

<ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
(a half whisper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, sir.

Daddy pauses, then in a different tone, his hidden gentleness and kindness are much more plain; as he talks Rose's eyes begin to well with tears.
</DIRECTION>
<DADDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, I know you've had some troubles in your life, those... scoundrels in Birmingham and so forth trying to... lead you astray. I hope you find a safe haven here, honey, I know you've had a hard time. Life can be cruel to a young girl all alone. We welcome you to our home, Rosebud, we all welcome you from the heart and hope you are happy here.

For a long time Daddy stares groggily at her with a half frown as if he can't believe it.

A shot of Buddy at night in his small bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He wears a rather skimpy old-fashioned nightshirt that comes midway between his hips and knees. At the moment he is finishing brushing his teeth at the bureau, using an old fashioned water pitcher and bowl. The CAMERA FOLLOWS as he walks across the room in the light of the lamp by his bed. He looks around cautiously, then picks up the mattress of his bed. He pushes it far back and we see springs. He takes out a small "book" or pamphlet and stares gravely at it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE-UP: The front cover of the pamphlet. We see the overall title: LITTLE DIRTY COMIC BOOKS. And beneath it: BLONDIE AND DAGWOOD. And beneath that, in smaller letters: "Mr. Dithers Comes to Dinner -- and How!" We see Buddy's hands in the shot, and he opens the pamphlet and we catch enough of a glimpse of the thing to know it is pretty awful -- a drawing maybe of "Blondie" stark naked with a finger in her mouth going, "Tee-Hee!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON Buddy, as he stares down with grave intentness at the Little Dirty Comic Book. Slyly now, he retraces his steps to the bureau and takes out a flashlight. He goes back to the bed, switches off the lamp, gets in the bed and turns on the flashlight and pulls the covers over his head. We hear a faint SOUND on the track and Buddy suddenly yanks back the covers, puts the flashlight on the table by the bed and throws the Little Dirty Comic Book under the bed. He lies on pillow and pretends he's asleep, and we hear the door of his room OPEN and a CREAKING on the floor.

Men, I don't understand them, I can't figure them out and they break my heart, that's all. I can't find Mr. Right, Buddy, I can't find him no matter how hard I look, all I find is a whole pile of Mr. Wrongs. But this is the worst ever because it wasn't his fault.

	What'd you do, Rose?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUDDY>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Buddy, I was horrible. I can't tell you who it was, but do you know what I did? I sat on his lap and got ahold of him and wiggled and wiggled my ass on him and was worse'n you could know, a child like you. Why, I let one of my tits fall out deliberate on purpose and practically smack him in the face with it and I let my dern skirt come up so he could see my drawers...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pauses, realizes this isn't too dignified)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But to get back serious to what I was sayin', it is not only, Buddy, the loss of him but my own bad behavior what bothers me so...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>
<BUDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were pretty bad, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUDDY>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, it has just made me ill, Buddy. I'm sick. I don't want to eat nothin', I don't, and me I got a good appetite, that ain't nat'ral for me. I'm ill.

(slyly, pretends he doesn't know)

	<DIALOGUE>
	But, Rose, what is the cause of it all?

</BUDDY>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Promise not to tell Doll? -- or nobody? Buddy, it's your Daddy! I'm so much in love with him I am out of my mind!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>
<BUDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But, Rose, how could such a thing as that happen?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUDDY>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I fell madly in love with him when he called me Rosebud. You know that first day when I come and he said I looked graceful like a capital letter S and called me Rosebud? I fell madly in love with that man right then.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(sighs tragically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But it's a lost love, Buddy. He's a good man and won't have nothin' to do with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE, on Rose and Buddy in the bed. Buddy has propped on an elbow and is staring down at her breasts in the moonlight -- we see the soft notch between her breasts in the open V of her thin nightgown. She is completely unself conscious with him.

<BUDDY>
<DIRECTION>
(casually)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I touch you here?

</BUDDY>

Before she can answer, he touches her breast with his finger through her nightgown.

	Hmmm, it's soft. It's awful soft.

	<DIALOGUE>
	What did you expect?

</ROSE>
<BUDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I thought they were more like a cantaloupe.

	Can I put my hand inside your nightgown, Rose?

</BUDDY>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you can't. And I'll tell you this -- he scares me. As kind as he is, he scares me. You can't fool around with him, not with that man. And, boy, I sure better not try nothin' like that with him again, he'll fire me.

CUT TO a shot of Mother's bedroom-study in the moonlight. We see Daddy lying wide-awake in a single bed staring broodingly out into space. Mother lies asleep in a big four poster in the background of the shot. Daddy sighs wearily to himself in the grip of "insomnia in reverse."

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT BACK to Buddy and Rose in bed. He has evidently sweet talked her into letting him fiddle with her; his hand is- in her nightgown. There is no indication of lewd interest on Rose's part, a peeved and exasperated look is on her face. Buddy seems quite fascinated, however.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, are you satisfied now? Can we just lie and talk, huh?

</ROSE>
<BUDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>

	'Course it does.

	All right, that's enough.

	You're just a child and wouldn't understand it, but that type of thing can stir a girl up. Now lie back and we'll talk.

	<DIALOGUE>
	There's an evil streak in everybody, Rose.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Rose, I have a serious favor to ask you.

</BUDDY>
<ROSE>

	Most men wouldn't do what he done. If they can get a girl they go right ahead and get her -- I guess to hell they do, just like a dern rabbit. 'Course later they'll tell her she's no good when they done the same thing their selves. They're a bunch of monkeys. I like 'em, but they're a bunch of monkeys.

	I'm curious to see what it's like. I'm very curious, Rose.

<DIRECTION>
A shot close on Rose and Buddy in bed. Evidently Rose has weakened and is allowing him to fiddle with her, but we can only surmise this, the shot is on their heads and shoulders and a cloud has crossed the moon, the light is more dim. A different look is on her face, a solemn expression as if she is listening to some far away sound that she finds strangely haunting. She moistens her lips, speaks in a slightly feeble voice.

CUT TO a shot of Rose as she enters her small bedroom. Feebly, as if totally exhausted, she shuts the door behind her then leans against a bureau and states into its mirror. The horror of her own criminality has overwhelmed her. With trembling hands, she takes a cigarette from her half empty pack and finds a wooden kitchen match on the bureau. Her hands tremble visibly as she strikes the match. She has not turned on the light in her room and her considerable charms are very apparent in the orange glow of the match. Burning match in her fingers, she stares at her own reflection in the bureau mirror, transfixed by a horrible realization.

QUICK DISSOLVE TO BLURRED SCREEN: the border of the screen is blurred, we are obviously seeing a nightmare fantasy.

CUT TO a shot of Buddy half asleep in bed. The light of the lamp by his bed goes on and he sleepily opens his eyes. The CAMERA COMES BACK and we see Rose in her nightgown standing by his bedside. She is very pale and tears are on her cheeks.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSE>

	I hate to turn on this light, you Daddy's awake downstairs, but I have to take the chance.

<ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
(her lip trembles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Buddy, I have to ask you, as bad as I've been please have pity on me and don't ruin me by telling them what I did. I know it was bad, it was bad and dumb. But mostly it was dumb, I didn't mean you no harm, I'd never want to hurt a hair on your head and that's the truth. I love you. But they'd think I did, they'd think I was awful, they'd despise me and hate me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
Rose bows her head and begins crying into her hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO a CLOSE SHOT of Buddy. We hear the soft sound of Rose weeping over the shot. Buddy is affected, his flinty child's heart has been touched, but he is not quite ready to admit it yet. He is struggling with himself, trying to remain "cool" and not show his emotion. He frowns, moistens his lips, swallows. With seeming coolness, very much as in the scene with Doll in which he deprecated Daddy's stand at Thermopylae, he shrugs.
</DIRECTION>
<BUDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I don't know what you're worried about. It was my idea, I was the one who thought of it, not you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUDDY>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA PULLS BACK to include Rose. She is staring at the boy with hopeless despair.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't understand. They'd blame me, not you. And they'd think I was awful, a disgustin' girl, which I am, but Buddy, please don't tell them. Please don't. Ill have to go and I love it here, I love your whole fam'ly, your Daddy, your Mother...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pauses, then makes her
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	final and ultimate plea in a shaking voice as
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
tears run down)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Buddy, I know I'm no good, I'm a bad girl but I can't help it, please have pity on me and don't tell! Please don't, please...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
Too much for Buddy, he loses his "cool." He swallows and blinks as if he might cry, then sits erect in the bed and squares his shoulders and assumes a stern expression Daddy style.
</DIRECTION>
<BUDDY>
<DIRECTION>
(very solemnly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rose, they could stick splinters under my fingernails, and I will never say a word! I will never tell them, because... I love you!

A shot of a coolly angry Mother in the kitchen. It is late morning. As she talks the CAMERA PULLS BACK to show a sheepish Buddy standing "on the carpet before her. The other children, Doll and Waski, are seated at the kitchen table having hamburgers for lunch. They are happily smiling with schadenfreude amusement at their brother's discomfiture.
</DIRECTION>
<MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Brother, when I have to wake you up at eleven o'clock in the morning you're either sick or you were up very late last night.

	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTHER>
<BUDDY>
<DIRECTION>
(sheepish)

	Mother, I have to tell the truth. I wasn't reading Huckleberry Finn, I was reading one of those Little Dirty Comic Books.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUDDY>
<MOTHER>

	I am in awe of it, Mother.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Mother, not the castor oil.

	<DIALOGUE>
	This isn't punishment, I don't believe in punishment. It's for your health. Obviously you're sick if you can act like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTHER>
<DIRECTION>
As she talks, Buddy reluctantly gets a bottle of castor oil and a tablespoon from a shelf and brings it to her. A smiling Doll comes forward and hands Buddy half of an orange. He makes a face at her. Mother takes the bottle and pours out a tablespoon of castor oil.
</DIRECTION>
<BUDDY>
<DIRECTION>
(wanly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mother, cant you make it calomel instead of castor oil?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUDDY>
<MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is for your own good. When you look at negative, destructive things like those little filthy comic books, you are sick. Here, take this.

	No, you didn't say that, Brother.

(glances around at sound of an opening door)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Rose, dear...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(her eyes open wide as she
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	stares at Rose,
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
disconcerted; now weakly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... my, you're... looking pretty...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTHER>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO a shot of Rose in the doorway of the kitchen. She is quite an apparition. She wears bright red lipstick, pink rouge on her cheeks, mascara and her hair is coiffed up in some outlandish manner, but her clothes are the most remarkable thing of all.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The skirt is of strange, pink, semi-shiny and very thin material and has about a dozen tiny little flowers that could be rosebuds sewed on it. It fits extremely snugly to say the least. The blouse seems a composite: it has frilly white sleeves that are opaque and otherwise is made of filmy white material that is hardly opaque at all. She has no bra and her breasts are half visible, the nipples denting the material. It is pretty wild for 1935. She seems to have on no underwear of any kind; the skirt, which clings to her like a bathing suit, shows no panty seams. She is carrying a shiny black patent leather pocketbook and has on high heel black patent leather shoes and no stockings. An ingenuous little smile is on her face.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you like my outfit? I made most of it myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
Rose walks in, "modeling" the outfit and the CAMERA PICKS UP Mother.

<MOTHER>

	Well, it's... very gay.

	Here comes Daddy.

<ROSE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I have a knack for designing clothes. But I had to buy the shoes and the pocketbook.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>
<MOTHER>
<DIRECTION>
(makes up her mind to defend Rose)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I think it's charming, Rose.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(tactfully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But don't you think... ah, the skirt is a little tight?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTHER>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, no, that's the style. It's meant to be clinging.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
We hear the PORCH DOOR SLAM. Smiling, happy, Rose glances around. We hear the SOUND of the kitchen door opening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO a POV SHOT of Daddy in the kitchen doorway. As usual, he has a rolled-up Glenville Tribune in his hand and a Straw hat on the back of his head.His hands are on his hips and he is hunched forward as if he cannot believe what he sees.
</DIRECTION>
<DADDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ye gods and little fishes. What have you done to yourself, Rose?

</DADDY>

Daddy walks slowly into the kitchen shaking his head. Sits at table.
</DIRECTION>
<DADDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Um-hmm. Well, that is the damndest outfit I ever saw in my life. You walk down the street like that and they'll put you in jail, Rose.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DADDY>
<MOTHER>

(a growl, doesn't like jokes about his foibles)

</ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
Daddy is staring with a very dubious frown at Rose's skirt. He slowly shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DADDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a pretty stylish skirt, Rose. The only thing I don't understand is how did you ever get it on.

</DADDY>
<ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
(solemnly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Mr. Hillyer, it was. I... I heard strange voices in the night.

</ROSE>
<DADDY>
<DIRECTION>
(softly strumming fingers, finally)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Strange voices, Rose?

(innocent as an angel)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>
<DADDY>
<DIRECTION>
(still aloofly polite)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now Rose, stop behaving as if you're Bo Peep. Those men had a flight last night because of some female in this house, and it wasn't Dolly or Mrs. Hillyer.

<MOTHER>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Darlin', it is not my fault if the girl has epizootics --
	</DIALOGUE>
</DADDY>
<DIRECTION>
-- The word means "an animal epidemic," and it's a pet word of Daddy's; he pronounces it epi-zoo-tics, not epi-zoo-ot tics, and uses it to mean any outrageous human malady --

<DADDY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- I am not responsible for her epizootics and I did not bring about her epizootics. Now listen to me. When I have to get up in the middle of the night and defend my home with a shotgun against a couple of damned scoundrels fistfighting in the bushes --

<MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Scoundrels? They weren't scoundrels, they were just boys.

</MOTHER>
<DADDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boys? You say to me boys?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DADDY>
<MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes! Yes, I say that to you, they were boys! Boy friends of Rose, chat's what they were, and why shouldn't she have boy friends? Do you want her to be unnatural? Don't you think she's human the same way you are yourself? It's the South, that's what it is, the South with its horrible traditions, of slavery and crime and the oppression of women, who are just as good as men and just as human!

<MOTHER>
<DIRECTION>
(in a real snit, afraid he will fire Rose)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And when I try to talk to you seriously, when I try to explain to you the unlimited creative power of life, how beautiful it would be if we gave up this hopeless struggle and simply loved each other from our hearts, what do you do -- you mock me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTHER>
<DADDY>
<DIRECTION>
(mildly, his eyes are even more glazed)

	It isn't her fault if she's popular... what?

</MOTHER>
<DADDY>

<MOTHER>
<DIRECTION>
(simmers down at once, now calmly)
</DIRECTION>

	Well, she finally let me look in her mouth. Is it true she's never been to a dentist?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_WINTON>
<MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She was raised on a poor dirt farm. I'm sure she's never seen a dentist or hardly even a doctor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTHER>
<DR_WINTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, she has one mouth in ten thousand, I don't see teeth like that once in ten years. Her trouble is an impacted wisdom tooth, but there isn't a cavity in her head, not a single one. She has perfect teeth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_WINTON>
<MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But the wisdom tooth will have to be pulled?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTHER>
<DR_WINTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, and it's very bad. It probably should be done at the hospital under general anesthesia.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_WINTON>
<MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That would scare her to death. She's terrified of hospitals. To her, a hospital is where you go to die.

	It's because of the children she's got to go. I don't want to be holier-than-thou, but the girl doesn't have the same outlook we do. Morals don't mean a thing to her, not a thing, and we can't have a girl like that in this house.

INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of DR. F. ROBERT MARTINSON, a rather unpleasant man with a spade beard. He has a superior, patronizing way of talking and very little Southern accent if any. The scene is his office and he is in a swivel chair behind his desk.

<MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She looks terrible, just awful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTHER>
<DR_MARTINSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course she does and I must say I'm puzzled by your delay in getting her to the hospital. I should think ordinary powers of observation would have suggested to you that she was seriously ill.

	Well, her people were very poor. She says she was often hungry as a child, and I'm sure the food she ate was pretty awful, not a balanced diet at all.

	<DIALOGUE>
	It's simply that I find it incredible, Mr. Hillyer. Aside from the girl's illness at the moment, she is very strong, a very healthy specimen of a young human female -- and a comely one, too. She must have gotten protein somewhere as a young child, if only sporadically.
	</DIALOGUE>

A SHOT of Rose in bed in her own bedroom. She is propped up on pillows and wearing a rather attractive pink silk housecoat of Mother's. A tray is on her lap and she is eating her supper as Buddy sits on the edge of the bed talking with her, or rather listening to her. It is obvious she is well on the road back to health.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, he's so kind, so gentle inside, and so unhappy with that rich wife who doesn't understand him, her being a Southerner and everything, and what a bedside manner he has got -- so gentle and kind beneath the professor way he acts!

<BUDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rose, you are too uncritical of people.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUDDY>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't know the bedside manner that man has got. Why, it does me good just to see him sit there all solemn and go pokin' in his bag like he's gonna cure me, which he did of course. And even more important he loves me, like a patient I mean, the other day he got tears in his eyes just listenin' to my heart beat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>
<BUDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He did?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUDDY>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, he tried to hide it but I saw 'em, and a little bit he says to me, "You know, you are beautiful." Now wasn't that a nice thing for a doctor to say to a patient, wasn't it? What could cheer a girl up more?

	Rose, I have got doubts about that doctor and so does Daddy.

	Yeah, I'd believe it.

	Rose, you are just entirely too uncritical of people.

	Justice, that's what he wants, justice for everybody and especially for niggers. And I think that's real nice of him because black people don't have a very good life, you got to admit that, to be a nigger is sometimes practic'ly fatal, but the wife don't understand all of that, she thinks niggers are just so much dirt, which anybody ought to know better if they been on their ass their ownselves -- and that is the cause of his profound unhappiness, Buddy, that no-good-mean wife with all her Southern prejudice against niggers and everything!

CUT TO a shot of Daddy and Buddy back in the garage. They are scrutinizing a wooden ladder that hangs on pegs alongside the garage. All Daddy needs is a cap and a pipe to be a dead ringer for Sherlock Holmes. He is in dead earnest about this, it is no Joke and he does not dream of being funny.

	We can't have it, Rose. Can you behave yourself -- or not? That is the question, to behave or not to behave, to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous chastity and keep your skirt down or to hoist it in the light of the moon and make whoopee -- that is the coil shuffling question.

(a dramatic pause, then points at her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you can't behave I am going to fire you and I say it in front of you and Mrs. Hillyer and I mean it. I point my rigid finger right at your nose, Rose, and I stare unwaveringly into your big blue eyes and I tell you... this is a final warning. Do you hear me?

	I'm not surprised you thought she was pregnant. An ovarian cyst can look very much like pregnancy. But it was pure wishful thinking on her part. The girl can never have children, she had gonorrhea at fifteen and it was untreated.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, it's definitely better, beyond question. A fatherless child, an ignorant girl with no job, no money, no home. It's fortunate, a blessing really, and a stroke of good luck for another reason I want to mention to you.

	I'm sorry the truth nauseates you, Mrs. Hillyer, because before you leave there's a bit more of it I'd like to put to you.

</MOTHER>
<DR_MARTINSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am thinking particularly of the other ovary. As a rule I don't believe in removing it. The woman's hormonal system is profoundly disturbed, she is subject to possibly serious depression, she loses many of her secondary sexual characteristics for example, her breasts might shrink and become flabby, facial hair might appear along with a coarsening of the features, and of course her sexual drive is greatly diminished, especially in a girl or young woman. For these reasons I am opposed to removing the other ovary, as a rule. Do you follow me?

</DR_MARTINSON>
<DADDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am ahead of you.

<DR_MARTINSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mrs. Hillyer, this girl is sick in more ways than one. She is an extreme psychoneurotic with uncontrollable sexual impulses. It would be a mercy to spare her the suffering she causes herself and others. Therefore I recommend as a therapeutic measure the removal of her second ovary. It is ethically and medically the only proper decision in this case and I suspect your husband agrees with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_MARTINSON>

in the kitchen, drink in hand, a look of grief on his face. He struggles to control himself, puts a hand over his eyes, then pulls himself together, turns from the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOT OF THE PATIO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON Willcox Hillyer and Daddy as the former walks up with his refreshed drink and sits down. He is in control now, his face is expressionless and he is seemingly calm.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLCOX_HILLYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you have knocked me for a hell of a loop, old man. A hell of a loop.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLCOX_HILLYER>
<DADDY>
<DIRECTION>
(simply)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. You loved her. So did I. It was an awful shock to me, too. An awful shock. Rose was so alive it's hard to believe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DADDY>
<WILLCOX_HILLYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't believe it, Daddy. I know it must be true, but I can't believe it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLCOX_HILLYER>
<DADDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's true, son. The girl with the cornflower eyes is dead, she is no more,
	</DIALOGUE>
</DADDY>
<DIRECTION>
Daddy pauses, in trouble emotionally, but gets a grip on himself and in an almost dispassionate manner; but powerful feeling is behind his words.
</DIRECTION>
<DADDY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She got cancer of the breast, was operated on and had a seven-year recovery, then after a brief illness passed on in her sleep, as the man with whom she'd lived in beautiful love and harmony for twenty-five years held her hand. That is what happened, son, and God rest her lovely soul!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DADDY>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO a CLOSE SHOT of Willcox Hillyer. Despite his efforts to control himself, tears are in his eyes. He clenches his teeth, takes a big swallow of his drink.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE on them both as Daddy rises.
</DIRECTION>
<DADDY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And now, if you are through with that Yankee whisky, we'll go to the Holiday Inn and get some dinner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DADDY>
<DIRECTION>
SHOT OF WILLCOX HILLYER AND DADDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as they walk toward the red rental Ford. Daddy uses a cane. He is a very old man. Willcox Hillyer looks in pain, he grimaces as they walk along.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLCOX_HILLYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why Rose? Why Rose, Daddy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLCOX_HILLYER>
<DADDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nobody lives forever, boy. Who'd want to?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DADDY>
<WILLCOX_HILLYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a hell of a thing to say. Why, Rose?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLCOX_HILLYER>
<DADDY>
<DIRECTION>
(stops and firmly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now look, boy, get a grip on yourself. Rose had a good life. She found her. Right, didn't she? She triumphed over everything, what are you blubbering about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DADDY>
<WILLCOX_HILLYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not blubbering.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLCOX_HILLYER>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO a shot of the red Ford going down the familiar driveway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOT ON DADDY AND WILLCOX HILLYER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
in the car. Daddy is staring fiercely ahead, Willcox Hillyer stares ahead in gloom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOT OF THE RED FORD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as it pulls up in front of the Holiday Inn we have already seen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOT ON DADDY AND WILLCOX HILLYER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
in the car. Willcox Hillyer sits there staring off into space in deep gloom. Daddy eyes him and now relents. We see sympathy in his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DADDY>
<DIRECTION>
(gently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rose isn't dead, son. Not really. Some of us die, but some of us don't. Rose lives. As long as some little girl somewhere gets herself up and goes out, Rose lives.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DADDY>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO a shot of Daddy and Buddy, now middle-aged Willcox Hillyer, as they walk toward the entrance of the Holiday Inn. MUSIC. THE END
