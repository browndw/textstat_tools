Inside, the airport is done up with festive posters, streamers and banners: Welcome - Pacific Partners Summit

A planeload of cheerful CHINESE DELEGATES come into the crowded terminal. Some sport red T-shirts with a picture of Mao wearing Mickey Mouse ears.

They get onto the people mover, passing by a TV REPORTER:

	Eager to mend its tarnished image, Los Angeles has really put out the welcome mat for tomorrow's summit. The city promises quite a party as leaders from Japan, China, South Korea, Australia, the U.S. and others begin talks for the largest free-trade treaty in history.

	The one sour note is North Korea, the only Pacific Rim country not participating.

EXT. NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Colonial-style mansion, surrounded by an imposing, wrought- iron fence. There is a bronze plaque, in English and Korean, next to the entranceway:

Consulate of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The driveway gate opens and a long, black Mercedes with tinted windows and diplomatic license plates glides out.

From atop a pole outside the south wall, a man with binoculars overlooks the private streets of Fremont Place.

as the Mercedes cruises through the quiet neighborhood.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
The man, PAUL JAVAL, is thirtyish, nervous; with short, sandy hair. He takes the binoculars away from his face and we see his eyes -- they're a strange, unnaturally light gray.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Javal takes an ORANGE PILL from an unlabeled prescription bottle and pops it into his mouth. He climbs down the pole to a van with a phone company logo on it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WILSHIRE BLVD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Mercedes comes out of the Fremont Place gate, and turns into the heavy morning traffic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is extremely quiet, due to inch-thick glass on the windows and 4,000 pounds of armor plating on the car's chassis.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The DRIVER is a North Korean Army Major. On the seat beside him is an AMD-74, a 5.45x39mm-caliber machine gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HAND from the back seat darts between the front seats and turns on the RADIO to a ROCK station. The Driver turns it off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

The hand belongs to 10-year-old SAM KE HAN. Sam sits back and sighs to his sister, JOY (15). Between them sits a middle-aged Scandinavian GOVERNESS.

Javal, wired, drums on the steering wheel while driving. He glances at some expertly constructed, radio-control REMOTE UNITS sitting on the seat next to him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Traffic is moving at about 35 MPH. The Mercedes merges onto the freeway, heading west. Javal's van follows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The thumping of a RAP SONG rattles the other drivers' fillings as a LOWRIDER with its stereo turned up to "11" cruises by.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Even 500 watts of bass cannot penetrate the armored silence. The Driver scans the road, wary but sensing no danger. He puts on his blinker to take the 405 South exit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The van follows, now directly behind the Mercedes, in a procession of vehicles going up the long, curved overpass arcing 100 feet above the 10, toward the 405.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they approach the crest of the overpass, Javal flips a switch on his radio-control unit...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE - ROAD SURFACE OF OVERPASS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Six small SEMICIRCLES, exact replicas of the stay-alert bumps on the white lines of the overpass, EXPLODE. They spew hundreds of sharp, triangular nails across the roadway. Immediately, scores of tires on passing cars BLOW OUT...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Causing, 50 yards ahead of the Mercedes and van, the most hellacious, gut-wrenching, piss-your-pants, chain-reaction PILE-UP you can imagine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dozens of drivers LOSE CONTROL of their vehicles... sideswipe their neighbors... grind against the guard rails. Some fishtail into 180's, smashing headlong into the traffic still coming onto the overpass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brakes squeal, people scream, metal crumples, airbags deploy, glass shatters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then it gets really nasty...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Honda gets jammed under a truck hauling cinder blocks. The truck JACKKNIFES, tipping over like a drunken giant.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It SMASHES through the concrete wall and guard rail...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Along with several cars and their SCREAMING OCCUPANTS, swept over the edge by the truck like discarded soda cans.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They plummet through space, CRASHING onto the freeway below.

Javal slides open a TRAP DOOR on the floor of the van. He slips a wheeled, mechanic's repair platform through it.

<DIRECTION>
ANGLE WITH JAVAL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as, unnoticed amid the chaos, he lies on the platform and rolls under the Mercedes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The undercarriage of the Mercedes is armored with steel. Javal stops at a patch of perforations -- an air exchange vent. He attaches a slim DEVICE over the vent, flips a switch on it, then rolls back toward the van.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Oblivious to Javal's actions below them, everyone watches as police and news helicopters circle above. Then, some CHP motorcycles straddle the lanes and zoom by.

The CHP has cleared a path through the devastation, and traffic trickles through. As the Mercedes and the van pass by, Javal looks proudly at the misery he's wrought. He follows the Mercedes onto the 405 south.

INT. JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Javal drives behind the Mercedes, with one hand on the radio unit. The Mercedes signals to take the Venice exit.

But he PASSES by the Mercedes as it gets off the freeway.

A pretty street in the Miracle Mile, lined with neat, single- family homes. Timed SPRINKLER systems water some of the yards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Every house on the block except the one we're in front of has a "For Sale" sign on the lawn. From the weathered looks of the signs, they've been there for quite a while.
</DIRECTION>

INT. CARSON'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
It's a hot night. The ceiling fan above the bed spins slowly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PETE CARSON tosses restlessly in bed, the sheets half-covering him. Next to him his wife, MIRANDA KNOLL, snores contentedly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carson is in his late thirties, outdoorsy, with a tight, muscular build. Emotionally he's tightly-wound as well.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda is 35, raven-haired, sensible, pretty. She believes above all else that one should never raise one's voice.

<DIRECTION>
Carson, younger, hair shorter, sits in an FBI COMMAND TRUCK across from the bank. Covering the mouthpiece of the phone in his hand, he's arguing with the OTHER AGENTS in the truck.

Suddenly, a huge, fiery EXPLOSION blows out the front of the bank building. Horrified, Carson runs toward it...

He races down the hall -- right past the house alarm keypad, its LCD reading "ARMED."

He grabs an aluminum baseball bat from the umbrella stand. Forgetting to disarm the house alarm, he yanks the front door open. The house alarm begins SHRIEKING.

EXT. CARSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carson comes around to the driveway, which is illuminated by the streetlight --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Where two 20-ish ASSHOLES are sitting in his 1965 Mustang convertible, their presence courtesy of a huge cut they've made in the otherwise-perfect ragtop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Car-theft tools in a leather case between them, they're prying the ignition switch out of the dashboard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Asshole #1 spots Carson. He gets out of the car, wielding a crowbar. His partner keeps working.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Asshole #1 lunges viciously, swiping at Carson with the crowbar, taking a piece out of his side. Carson starts BLEEDING profusely, but he's too pissed to notice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carson uses his bat to take the offensive. They go at each other like combatants in a swordfight, the CLANKING of metal echoing through the neighborhood along with the screaming house and car ALARMS, and frantic neighborhood DOGS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Surprised at Carson's fury and strength, Asshole #1 backs onto the lawn, oblivious to the running SPRINKLERS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he backs away, his shoe catches on one of the sprinkler heads. It breaks off, and a huge GEYSER of water sprays out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carson holds his bat in both hands and jams the front of it into Asshole #1's breadbasket. He doubles over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carson grabs Asshole #1's arm, and pulls it quickly against his raised knee. There is a SNAP and a loud howl as the arm breaks, and Carson tosses him aside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seeing this, Asshole #2 gives up on the car. He takes off toward the street. Carson runs to head him off, but he's a lot faster in his Air Jordans than Carson is in his bare feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carson grabs the metal lid from a garbage can at the curb and FLINGS it like a huge Frisbee. It sails across the street --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And NAILS Asshole #2's head. He kisses the pavement, stunned.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carson runs up and grabs him, but he pulls out a long, sharp screwdriver and jabs at Carson with it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, blue flashing lights appear from around the corner: A WESTEC Chevy Blazer. Two uniformed GUARDS get out, and fumble with their sidearms.
</DIRECTION>
<WESTEC_GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everybody... chill! Bikini boy! On the ground!

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
Holding his bleeding side, Carson walks back to his house. He notices the "Neighborhood Watch" sign has graffiti spray- painted on it. He touches it -- the paint is still wet. His Neighbor shrugs -- whatta ya gonna do?

The PAPER GUY drives by... and tosses Carson's newspaper right under the gushing SPRINKLER.

Ambassador Han reads through the morning's faxed communiquÈs. He's 43, rarely smiles, and hates living in the U.S. He's dressed in an impeccably-tailored, Valentino two-piece suit.

Mrs. Han is slender, soft-spoken, but as iron-willed as her husband. She, however, is quick to smile. She's wearing a summery dress with a white sweater over her shoulders.

He speaks with a slight accent, French, perhaps. He pops an orange pill, then unlatches the rear doors of the van. With a quick glance back at him, she goes to open the doors.

Javal grabs a plastic tarp and throws it over the Governess' upper body. He puts his arm across her neck, flicks open a gravity knife and PLUNGES it through the tarp, into her chest.

He then glances at his wounded Mustang, parked in the street. He spots something on the windshield: A pink parking ticket.

A dark-green government Dodge pulls up and parks behind one just like it on a paved area near the Consulate gate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAVE JUAREZ, (chubby, 40, Mexican-American, a desk jockey) gets out of the Dodge and hangs an FBI shield over his top pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He glances over at North Korean Security Chief COLONEL LEE, (45), who has paused inside the gate to regard Dave, and the outside world, with profound contempt.

Dave, attachÈ case in one hand and notebook computer in the other, walks to a 10-by-15 detached guardhouse on the far corner of the property, just outside the high fence.

EXT. CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they approach the light at Washington Blvd, just turning yellow, Javal's van gets in front of the Mercedes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Their lanes stop for the red light. A FRUIT VENDOR holding a bag of oranges walks from car to car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Javal slips the van into neutral and lets it roll back until his rear bumper taps gently against the Mercedes' front bumper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MERCEDES - INCLUDE POV THROUGH REAR VIEW MIRROR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Driver hits the HORN. The van doesn't move. The Driver glances in the rear-view:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a Jeep Cherokee tight on his tail, and the BLACK LADY in it is busy dealing with a carpool full of 8-year-old KIDS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Driver looks at Mrs. Han, who's peering out the side window, fascinated by the African-American-themed storefronts. They're all festooned with Summit-related banners, and SHOP OWNERS are preparing for a community sidewalk bazaar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam, bored, stuffs several pieces of GUM into his mouth.

Javal flips the switch on his radio-controlled remote.

Under the Mercedes, the device Javal planted there begins to emit thick, white CS TEAR GAS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MERCEDES - DAY

The GAS pours in through the ventilation system. Everyone inside starts coughing and choking uncontrollably. The Driver grabs his AMD-74 machine gun and pops the door locks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Driver, Mrs. Han, Joy, Sam and Lisa pile out of the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jittering with excitement, fear and speed, Javal hops out of his van, holding a Benelli M-1, a semi-automatic shotgun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He SHOOTS the Driver in the chest. The BLAST from the shotgun muzzle, however, is unlike anything we've ever seen before: it is blindingly BRIGHT, even in broad daylight, belching a huge cluster of glowing, white-hot magnesium.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Driver flies back against the Mercedes, EMPTYING his machine gun into the air. The wound in his chest is full of BURNING magnesium shrapnel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The other drivers in the intersection see this and go completely nuts. Some duck for cover under their dashboards. Others peel away. A few COLLIDE with oncoming traffic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Carpool Lady in the Cherokee pushes the kids down on the floor. The Fruit Vendor hides by rolling under a car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam and Joy are incapacitated by tear-gas coughing fits. Mrs. Han stumbles toward them, trying to get them to run away. Javal PUNCHES her, knocking her down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns to Lisa, surprised to see her. Sweating, he points the shotgun at her... almost pulls the trigger... then notices Mrs. Han's expression of horror and thinks the better of it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He spots a MOTORIST in a Ford Escort, peering cautiously over his dashboard to get a look at the action.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Javal SHOOTS the Motorist through the windshield with another bright, searing blast of magnesium. The Motorist and the entire front of his car burst into FLAMES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Han is on her knees, sobbing. Javal grabs her by the arm and pulls her to the back of the van. He opens the doors.
</DIRECTION>
<JAVAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see that I'm serious in my intention, yes?

He tightens his grip on her. She nods again, then looks at the kids. Javal shoves her, Sam, Joy and Lisa into the van.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JAVAL'S VAN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs three pairs of handcuffs off a C-shaped bar welded on both ends to the inside of the van. He handcuffs one of Mrs. Han's arms, passes the chain through the bar, then handcuffs the other. He does the same with Sam; then handcuffs one of Joy's arms, passes the chain through and attaches the other handcuff to Lisa.

Javal hops in his seat and drives away on Washington.

Across from the garage, parked parallel against the back of an empty building, we notice a duplicate van. It's facing the same direction as Javal is driving.

Javal slams on the brakes, stopping just past the garage, and then quickly backs up into the garage.

As he pulls in, we catch GLIMPSES of the van slipping backwards into a FIBERGLASS SUPERSTRUCTURE that fits tightly around the rear two-thirds of it. As the van comes to a stop, several snap- buckles on the edge of the superstructure spring closed.
</DIRECTION>

Javal reaches out the van window and pulls on a rope hanging from the ceiling of the garage. The rope releases the door from the opening mechanism, so it immediately falls CLOSED.

Then, Javal turns several switches on another of his neatly- constructed remotes:

Steel straps are holding the steering wheel rigid.

Engage the transmission;

And supply fuel to the carburetor.

The duplicate van takes off down the alley. Just as it gets up to speed, Carson and the others round the corner into the alley behind it. As far as they know, they're still chasing Javal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The alley is several blocks long, running parallel to the main road, separated at each block by perpendicular streets. The duplicate van races along, scraping against parked cars and the rear walls of buildings...

Indeed, as the duplicate van crosses a street, cars swerve to avoid hitting it. It continues into the next alley.

Up ahead, a garbage truck lumbers into the far end of the alley, its metal lift-rods extended to pick up a dumpster.

Carson, horrified, jumps out of his car. Robbins and Sabatini run up. They have to hold Carson away from the burning van. Dave hurries to the back of a building and gets sick.

Colonel Lee, wide-eyed with anger, gets in Carson's face.

EXT. ALLEYWAY GARAGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A block away, the garage door opens, and we hear something eerie and unexpected: a scratchy, music-box kids' SONG, coming from a loudspeaker.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Javal's van pulls out and we see its TRANSFORMATION: The superstructure surrounding the body of the van makes it look like a graffiti-covered, unlicensed ice cream vendor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALLEYWAYS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The entrance of the alley is blocked by a black-and-white. So, accompanied by the SONG, Javal drives along the one-way alley in his camouflaged van, passing unnoticed by the authorities.

Anguished, Carson is staring at the BURNING duplicate van...

INT. BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One room, bathroom and kitchenette. A laptop computer and peripherals are on a table, along with some cell phones, a toolbox, and some jumbles of electronic circuitry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the main room, there are three large Lazy-Boy easy chairs, side by side, facing a 27-inch TV on a stand. A cloth covers two OBJECTS sitting atop the TV.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens. Mrs. Han, Joy, Sam, and Lisa walk in, rigid with fear. Javal, Beretta 9mm in hand, comes in behind them and closes the door. Javal strips off his sweat-soaked shirt and wipes his face with it. Mrs. Han realizes he's wired to the moon... and it terrifies her.
</DIRECTION>
<JAVAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does anyone need to use the rest room? This will be your last opportunity for a few hours.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

	Very well. Mrs. Han, Sam, Joy, please sit here.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lisa...

</LISA>
<DIRECTION>
Still holding the Beretta, he grabs a polo shirt from the closet and pulls it on. As the family sits in the chairs:
</DIRECTION>
<JAVAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Mrs. Han, this one. Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAVAL>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a pair of handcuffs out of his pants pocket. He tries to handcuff Lisa, hands behind her back, but she resists.
</DIRECTION>
<JAVAL>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing; sotto)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You afford me some additional bargaining power. But not much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAVAL>
<DIRECTION>
She wilts. Javal cuffs her to the handles of the refrigerator. He puts a strip of duct tape from his tool box across her mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He uncovers one of the items atop the TV: An electronic box with three pairs of oversized, LED VU meters on the front of it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We NOTICE neat lines of wires running from each of the chairs up into it. Javal flips one of a row of switches on it; a green light and the meters come to life.
</DIRECTION>
<JAVAL>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There. No taping your mouths, no restraints. Please remain still while I explain. The meters on the left indicate sound pressure -- Decibels. There are microphones on your chair backs. If you raise your voices above certain level, putting your meter in the red zone for more than one sustained second, the circuit will be closed.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The right meters indicate motion. There are pressure sensors inside the armrests and seats. The sensors don't like to get wet, so I hope you were honest about not needing to use the loo. If you make any excess movements, or try to leave your chair, the circuit will be closed.

</MRS_HAN>
<JAVAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kaboom...

</JAVAL>
<DIRECTION>
He uncovers the other item atop the TV -- a one-pound brick of C-4 high explosive with the detonation mechanism jammed into it. Mrs. Han gasps and begins to PANIC.
</DIRECTION>
<JAVAL>

Colonel Lee and his Officers stand by the stairs; Robbins, Sabatini and Dave stand together near the front door.

Hands shaking with nerve- and speed-induced jitters, Javal turns two switches on the unit atop the TV. Two LED readouts light up: one shows the current time -- 2:30 PM -- the other is fixed at 5:00 PM. Below, the TV is still on.

Sabatini and Dave follow a few cars behind as he gets on it.

Suddenly, he scoots over to the shoulder and slams the van into REVERSE. He backs off the on-ramp, past a row of angry drivers, passing by Sabatini and Dave.

Peeling in reverse onto Highland, Javal stomps on the brakes. The snap buckles holding the ice-cream-truck superstructure around his van BREAK APART, and the whole thing slides off... blocking Sabatini's way.

Suddenly, the rear doors of the van burst open...

Seeing Carson approaching on his right, Javal pulls his Benelli shotgun from one of the saddlebags. He rests the barrel on his arm and FIRES a blinding-white load of magnesium at Carson.
</DIRECTION>

Carson grabs the brake handles to slow down, and the BLAST crosses just in front of him. A few BURNING pieces pepper the front fender of the bike, but the bulk HITS the concrete art- deco statue in the entrance to the Hollywood Bowl. The statue shatters into a million FLAMING fragments.

Then, spotting some police cars ahead, he quickly hangs a right, ducking onto Alta Loma Terrace.

EXT. ALTA LOMA TERRACE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carson stops at the entrance to the winding, hillside neighborhood, accessible only by footpaths. The area is covered by thick foliage, hiding Javal from the helicopter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carson revs down so he can listen for Javal's machine. He HEARS it up above and takes off, up a steep flight of stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Javal has reached the summit, only to find he's boxed in. He can either turn around, or take the neighborhood's unique, outdoor elevator, housed in a free-standing, three-story concrete tower.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He jumps off his bike. Carrying the saddlebags, he runs into the elevator -- but it needs a key to operate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Javal comes back out, panicking. He HEARS Carson coming up the hill. He spots a GARDENER watering nearby with a hose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE WITH CARSON

And then he sees the Gardener, sprawled on the ground, a BULLET HOLE in the center of his forehead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carson turns off his motorcycle and pulls out his Sig 9mm. He moves slowly toward the elevator tower and looks inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The casement window in the back of the tower is broken. One end of the gardener's hose is tied to a grate, and the hose is hanging through the broken window.

But just as Carson is about to climb down the hose...

<DIRECTION>
EXT. HIGH TOWER DRIVE - DAY

Javal spots a COLLEGE GIRL backing a tiny Geo out of her garage. He rips her out of the car, jumps in and tears away.

Carson jumps back on his motorcycle and starts it up.

</CARSON>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the Geo, Javal drives out onto Highland. He muscles his way through traffic, then cuts across to Franklin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind him, Robbins and Walther drive along the divider lane.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the bike, Carson emerges from Alta Loma, joining Sabatini and Dave in Dave's Dodge and Colonel Lee in the Mercedes as they all try to catch up to Javal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The helicopter flies ahead, then disappears past the hill below Franklin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. VINE STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Javal hangs a hard right off of Franklin onto Vine, putting him on top of a hill that drops down to Sunset.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carson and Colonel Lee close in on the Geo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the helicopter RISES UP from the bottom of the hill. It's less than fifty feet in front of Javal, at eye level.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Javal FIRES at the copter with his Beretta.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Colonel Lee indiscriminately FIRES his machine gun at the Geo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carson SHOUTS at Colonel Lee, furious at his carelessness!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PURSUIT COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Colonel Lee's BULLETS trace across the cockpit of the helicopter; one hits the PILOT in the neck. Clutching it with one hand, the Pilot loses control of the copter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. VINE STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone on the road scatters to get out of the copter's way. It appears as though it's going to crash onto the street, then it gains altitude, GYRATING wildly just above the Geo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Javal tries to move away, but one of its landing runners SMASHES through the top of the windshield, WEDGING itself against the inside of the Geo's roof.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Snared, the little Geo is LIFTED off the ground -- instantly too high for a terrified Javal to escape from it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PURSUIT COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wounded Pilot, barely conscious, searches for safe area to set down -- but there are cars and people everywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Pilot wrestles his stick; his copter is almost impossible to control with the car hanging from it. He's fading...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. VINE STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The copter and Geo lurch over and past the round Capitol Records building, KNOCKING the spindle off the top of it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The impact further destabilizes the copter's flight. It's heading right toward the 20-story Sunset Vine Tower, at the bottom of the hill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JAVAL'S GEO - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Javal, trapped inside, looks through the windshield as the glass and steel side of the tower looms closer. He SCREAMS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SUNSET VINE TOWER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The copter and the Geo CRASH into the side of the Tower, 12 floors up. Glass blows out in all directions; the rotor shatters; office furnishings are blown through the hole like backwash.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Geo hangs passenger's side down from the runner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the series of jerking, slipping MOVEMENTS, it is clear the copter is not going to stay where it is for long.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Geo's passenger side door pops open. Javal, panting with fear, jimmies his foot against the dashboard and holds the steering wheel to keep from falling out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON VEHICLES BELOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the clog of traffic, cars swerve away, rapidly reverse... anything to get away from the area below the impact.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAVAL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
reacts to another SLIP. The big saddlebags of money on the seat start to slide toward the open door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He gingerly reaches over to grab them... the copter SHIFTS again... he loses his grip...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And, clutching the saddlebags, he TOPPLES out of the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We stay with him as he FALLS 12 stories, SCREAMING...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then LANDING on top of a parking meter. It RIPS though his chest and he hits the sidewalk with a wet THUD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. VINE AND SUNSET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carson rushes across the street to Javal's body. The teetering copter and Geo are right above it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grimacing, Carson tries to lift Javal's body up off the parking meter, but it's messy, slippery work...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unable to move the body, Carson quickly searches its pockets. All he finds is the now-empty prescription bottle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Above, the copter GROANS... it's about to come loose...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carson pulls out his Sig 9mm and FIRES several times at Javal's right wrist, then TEARS the HAND off the body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a loud WRENCHING of metal, the copter and Geo break away from the building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carson grabs the saddlebags and runs like hell across the street, diving for cover behind a car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEHIND CARSON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the copter and Geo crash to the sidewalk and EXPLODE.
</DIRECTION>

Sooty, covered in Javal's blood, Carson crosses to the others. He throws Walther the saddlebags and Sabatini the severed hand.

</SABATINI>

Carson grabs one of the expensive pens from Ambassador Han's desk, SNAPS it in half, and hands it to her.

In the b.g. she stands at the credenza, inks the hand's fingers and thumb and rolls them onto a piece of letterhead paper.

Her head is spinning. She looks at Carson.

INT. NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the converted attic, several North Korean ESPIONAGE AGENTS monitor military and police frequencies, downlinks from remote wiretaps and surveillance units; short-wave, cellular, etc. Their equipment, being of Chinese and Iranian manufacture, is hardly cutting-edge technology.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Colonel Lee and Ambassador Han enter. The Espionage Agents are surprised when Carson, Miranda, Walther and Sabatini follow. Walther looks around, amazed. Carson grabs a pair of headphones.
</DIRECTION>
<CARSON>

INT. MIMOSA APARTMENTS - JAVAL'S APARTMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carson cautiously peers in the moving boxes. They're empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He crosses to the front door, looks it over, unlocks the deadbolt. He turns the knob, the button POPS open...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stops, noticing a HAIRLINE SEAM in the doorjamb where a piece was cut, then neatly replaced.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, he's startled as he hears a strange, mechanical whining NOISE coming from the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He goes to investigate -- it's an almost-dead, avocado-green refrigerator straining to start its compressor. He looks for booby-traps, opens it, and looks inside. Empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looking down, he notices he's got a dead leaf stuck to the bottom of his shoe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Glancing in the living room, he sees the dead leaves on the floor below the three hanging plants. He looks at the plants: two are dead. The one in the middle is not. It's plastic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We HEAR the jiggle of the front doorknob.

Too late... The front door opens....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carson crouches behind the big, heavy refrigerator door...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the middle flower pot EXPLODES. It's a shrapnel bomb: it spews thousands of tiny carpet tacks 360 degrees around room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sabatini is HIT full on -- she falls backwards into the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MIMOSA APARTMENTS - #1058 - DAY

Miranda and the women in the darkened bedroom SCREAM as the tacks tear hundreds of HOLES through sections of the wall.

Tiny shafts of LIGHT appear in the wall, except where it is covered by furniture (keeping them from being shredded.)

<DIRECTION>
INT. MIMOSA APARTMENTS - HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SWAT Team #2 and Colonel Lee come running, as does Miranda.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carson is kneeling next to Sabatini. She looks up at him and tries to say something, but a only long, mournful, final BREATH escapes her. Agonized, Carson looks around...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And sees Colonel Lee. He lunges for him.
</DIRECTION>
<CARSON>

Carson is in the FBI command truck, talking on the phone to:

A BANK ROBBER, barricaded inside the bank. Phone in hand, he holds a shotgun on a dozen hostages: BANK EMPLOYEES and CUSTOMERS -- including a couple of YOUNG KIDS. One is holding a soccer-sized, rainbow-colored rubber ball.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The OTHER BANK ROBBER wires up a series of explosive charges.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Both Robbers rush inside the vault, and pull the door closed to protect themselves...
</DIRECTION>

The front of the building, where the hostages are, EXPLODES.

Across the room, Colonel Lee is watching Carson intently.

Carson turns to look at him. They make eye contact.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Time stands still.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Realization.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Feeling like he's moving in SLOW MOTION, Carson reaches for the Sig 9mm in his shoulder holster.

Colonel Lee grabs the AMD-74 machine gun on the desk.
</DIRECTION>
<CARSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get down!

</CARSON>
<DIRECTION>
Colonel Lee STRAFES the room and backs toward the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The BULLETS trace a line across the room. One of the North Korean Espionage Agents is HIT. He slams against the console.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carson tackles Ambassador Han and shoves him onto the floor, while popping off several ROUNDS in Colonel Lee's direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Robbins also dives for cover, pushing Walther down first. Robbins takes a BULLET in the shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda is HIT. The impact tumbles her over the desk.

Colonel Lee, still FIRING, slips out the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gunsmoke hangs in the air as Carson scrambles to Miranda. Several PHONES have begun ringing. No one notices them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dave never moved -- he sits hunched over, clutching his notebook computer, muttering the HAIL MARY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carson rolls Miranda over. She's got a large, scorched bullet hole in the front of her blouse. Carson tears her blouse open. She's wearing a kelvar vest under it, and the slug is mushroomed against the vest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She awakens, GASPS and starts swinging her fists at him. Carson is overwhelmed with relief.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he notices Robbins, bleeding profusely, propped against the wall next to Walther. Walther is dead -- shot in the head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OS, we hear several SPURTS of machine gun fire, and a car ENGINE roaring to life. Miranda looks at Carson...

Carson bursts through the door just as the second armored Mercedes CRASHES through the wrought-iron entry gates. Carson fires several SHOTS, which ping harmlessly off the Mercedes.

The Apache hovers parallel to the apartment, 20 feet away. Carson feeds out a steel cable from a winch...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then throws a spring-loaded grappling hook onto the thick, iron balcony railing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hanging onto a webbed rescue harness, Carson slides quickly across the line, onto the balcony. Using the butt of his Sig 9mm, he BREAKS a hole in the glass on the locked sliding glass door. He reaches through and unlatches it.

The family is coughing from the smoke, trying not to panic.

In the kitchen, Lisa can't cough through the tape on her mouth. She's freaking out.

Seeing this, Carson runs over to her and pulls the tape off. She starts SCREAMING, so he grabs her face.

Carson spots Javal's toolbox. In it, he finds a socket set handle, which he levers in between the refrigerator handle and the door. He rips one handle loose, then the other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carson turns his attention to the booby-trapped chairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lisa sits on the floor, frantically pulling her handcuffed hands around her feet so they're in front of her, then runs for the front door. Just as she reaches it:
</DIRECTION>
<CARSON>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Slide your arm forward... Watch the meter... Keep the pressure on the armrest with your elbow...

</CARSON>
<DIRECTION>
They look at each other, scared... After a beat, she does.

<DIRECTION>
The meter JIGGLES... but stays in the black! Everyone sighs with relief. Carson repeats the process on her other armrest.

Carson feels for the sensor in the seat, finding it buried under Mrs. Han's thighs. He runs a long piece of tape around the seat and wraps it tightly.

He tries to lift Mrs. Han, but the meter moves to the red.
