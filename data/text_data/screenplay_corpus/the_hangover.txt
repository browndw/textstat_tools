It's a beautiful spring morning in the Palisades. High atop the cliffs, looking out over the Pacific Ocean, sits the exclusive BEL AIR BAY CLUB.

A simple, classic wedding dress hangs on a closet door in this sun-drenched bridal suite. Sitting at the makeup table, surrounded by her bridesmaids, is the beautiful bride, TRACY TURNER, 20's. She's busy doing her makeup. Just then, Tracy's rich, stern FATHER, 50's, blows in.

The top down, The Who's "Baba O'Riley" blasting from the stereo, Vick's pristine Cadillac convertible rockets down Highway 10 towards Nevada. At the wheel is Vick, looking as sharp as his Caddy in a half- open shirt and mint condition aviators. Sitting shotgun is the groom, DOUG BILLINGS, late 20's, handsome, barefoot, crunchy -- an all around great guy. Behind Vick sits ALAN MERVISH, late 20's, an anal tax attorney from Connecticut, his Izod shirt tucked into his khakis. He's currently applying sun screen to his forehead. Next to Alan is STU PRYCE, late 20's, former high school linebacker and lovably dimwitted father of two. He drums the back of the frontseat to the music, totally pumped, like this is his first time out of the house in years. Because it is.

Furniture is broken, the minibar ransacked, and the floor is covered with remnants of the night before: empty beer cans, platefuls of room service food, a cowboy hat, the Gideon Bible, half-eaten skinless mangos, a bra, a battle axe, etc. SNORING on the couch, wearing only his jeans and one shoe, the word ASSHOLE written in Sharpie across his chest, is Stu.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TITLE CARD: "SATURDAY, 11:15AM" The chicken struts across the top of the couch, until it reaches a plastic coin cup from Bellagio blocking its path. Beat. Then the chicken pecks it off...onto Stu. The cup hits Stu in the face, and stale beer splashes all over him. Stu spastically jerks awake and flips off the couch, onto a pile of newspapers.
</DIRECTION>
<PILE_OF_NEWSPAPERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OWW! Get off! Get off! Jesus!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Confused, Stu clambers off the pile of newspapers -- to find Vick sleeping underneath, on the floor, fully dressed. Vick pulls himself onto the couch, clearly in pain.
</DIRECTION>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn, dude, why are you retarded?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Both men are ragingly hungover. A long beat as both of them rub their faces, then:
</DIRECTION>
<VICK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Um, Stuey?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICK>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STU>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you have a mullet?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Stu does, in fact, have a mullet haircut. But he's too hungover to understand.
</DIRECTION>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STU>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, business on top, party down the back?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Stu still looks confused. This is excruciating for Vick.
</DIRECTION>
<VICK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your hair, dude. You have a mullet.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Stu touches his hair. Then he stumbles into the bathroom. After a beat, we hear his voice:
</DIRECTION>
<STU>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dude...I have a mullet.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Then we hear ALAN'S VOICE in the bathroom, groggy:
</DIRECTION>
<ALAN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just give me ten more minutes, Beck...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<STU>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa, did you sleep in the tub?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Beat, then Stu pokes his head out of the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<STU>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Check it out: Alan slept in the tub.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STU>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get him up. I'm hungry.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Stu disappears back into the bathroom. We hear the SHOWER turn on. Beat. Then we hear Alan slowly awaken:
</DIRECTION>
<ALAN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wet. Water. Jesus, what's--?!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
There's a THUD as Alan falls out of tub. Beat. Then Stu and a very confused, very hungover, very wet Alan stumble out of the bathroom. Alan appears to be wearing his polo shirt from the night before. Only, as we PULL BACK, we see that his shirt is cut off at his chest -- he's naked from there down.
</DIRECTION>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, dude, put away your sack.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Alan looks down at his hairy nakedness, totally bewildered.
</DIRECTION>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, and it might be time for some manscaping, bro. Your bush looks like Yanni.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Alan looks back up again, squinting, hungover.
</DIRECTION>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did we do last night?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:

:SC: INT. HALLWAY -- MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The guys, now dressed, stagger out of their suite moments later. Stu walks incredibly bow-legged, like an aging cowboy.
</DIRECTION>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dude, why is my ass killing me...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STU>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. ELEVATOR -- MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looking like crap, the guys silently descend in the elevator. BING! The elevator opens to expose a NICE-LOOKING COUPLE waiting to get on. They see the guys and immediately step away from the elevator.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll...we'll get the next one.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The doors close. The guys continue to descend. Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We might not smell very good.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The guys shake their heads, yeah, no.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. MANDALAY BAY -- BREAKFAST BUFFET -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The guys slouch in a booth, shoveling masses of buffet food into their mouths, washing it down with huge mugs of coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This might be the worst hangover anyone has ever had, ever.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STU>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't taste anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please stop talking. If I don't focus on eating I'm going to throw up all over myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The guys nod, right. They keep eating. After a long while:
</DIRECTION>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey... Are we missing something?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The guys all slowly look around. Then Stu points at Alan:
</DIRECTION>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes: I left my hat in the room -- thank you, Alan.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They continue eating. Alan looks up again, still troubled.
</DIRECTION>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. That's not it... There's something else...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Vick nods at Stu as he stuffs food in his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You gonna finish that cruller?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Stu shakes his head, no. Vick takes it, packs it into his already stuffed mouth. Then Alan realizes:
</DIRECTION>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doug. Guys, where's Doug?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The guys look around. Hunh.
</DIRECTION>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. He's not here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STU>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Probably left him in the room.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Vick pulls out his cell phone, starts dialing.
</DIRECTION>
<VICK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll call his cell.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Then a phone RINGS in Stu's pocket. He answers:
</DIRECTION>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good morning, this is Stu?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STU>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's me, meatdick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICK>
<STU>
<DIRECTION>
(to Alan, concerned)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's Vick--
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Then Stu realizes. Oh.
</DIRECTION>
<STU>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is Doug's phone.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Vick nods, ya. He's already dialing another number.
</DIRECTION>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You calling the room?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Vick nods, uh-huh. He lets it ring, rubbing his temples. Then he hangs up.
</DIRECTION>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No answer.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Vick goes back to eating. Alan frowns.
</DIRECTION>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ummm...shouldn't we look for him? Check-out is in like ten minutes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, and we told Tracy we'd have Doug back to LA by five.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Vick just looks at both of them, his mouth full of food:
</DIRECTION>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm eabing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICK>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What an asshole. Stu, check the pool and the casino, I'll check the room and the gym. Maybe he's working out or something...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Stu nods, and they slowly slide out of the booth.
</DIRECTION>
<ALAN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And Vick, if you could keep a close eye on the buffet, that'd be really helpful. Thanks, man.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Alan and Stu saunter off. Vick yells after them, mouth full:
</DIRECTION>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	HE'S FIME! YOU'RE OBERWEACTING!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Vick scowls, and angrily takes Alan's last cruller.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:

:SC: INT. DEAN MARTIN SUITE -- MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alan weaves through the totalled suite, half-awake.
</DIRECTION>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doug...? Doug...? Wake up, man.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Alan enters the bedroom where Doug slept, and stops. It takes him a second to realize what's wrong:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BED IS MISSING There are four indentations on the carpet where it once lay. Alan scratches his head.
</DIRECTION>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's weird...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. MANDALAY BAY -- POOL -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stu, walking bow-legged, squinting painfully in the bright sun, tries to inspect everyone lying around the huge pool. Doug? Doug? Several HOT WOMEN in bikinis sit up, disgusted!
</DIRECTION>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no. It's cool, I'm a dad. It's totally cool...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STU>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. GYM -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alan stumbles through the gym, looking for Doug. The place is packed with fit people, working out. Alan mumbles to himself:
</DIRECTION>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hate you all...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. CASINO FLOOR -- NICKEL SLOTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stu wanders through the casino, calling out, incredibly loud:
</DIRECTION>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	DOUG! DOUG!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Two GAY MEN in identical tank tops pass by, holding hands.
</DIRECTION>
<GAY_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey Stu.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GAY_MAN>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey guys. DOUG! DOUG--!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Then Stu registers what just happened. He stops and turns around -- enh? -- but the gay men are gone. Before he can comment, however, he sees Vick and Alan talking to Atashir at
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE RECEPTION DESK He slowly bow-legs himself over.
</DIRECTION>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You find Doug?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STU>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I assume you didn't either?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Stu shakes his head, no. Then Atashir hangs up his phone.
</DIRECTION>
<ATASHIR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is no Doug Billings at any of the area hospitals, morgues, or police stations.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The guys frown, starting to grow worried.
</DIRECTION>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe he went for a jog?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STU>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dude. It's 120 degrees outside.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or shopping?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The guys just look at him like: you're an idiot.
</DIRECTION>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great. So we've officially lost Doug. His wedding is in what, 22 hours?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Relax, it's Doug, he's probably crashed out on someone's couch right now. All we have to do is retrace our steps from last night, and we'll find him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICK>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, so last night...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The guys wince, trying to remember. It's painful to think.
</DIRECTION>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, we started on the roof...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICK>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right, that was like, 6ish...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then...I think...we had steaks at the Palm?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICK>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Then...we played craps at the Hard Rock...maybe?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That sounds right...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Stu throws up his arms, already giving up.
</DIRECTION>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, honestly? I don't even remember going to dinner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STU>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I vaguely recall...doing body shots ....at some point? Is that...maybe?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICK>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm pretty much blank after The Hard Rock.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think we went to the Flamingo after that...? And then, I just remember a lot of blue light...and the overpowering smell of baby oil.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICK>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So that was what, 10ish?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give or take.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICK>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was Doug still with us?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Vick rubs his temples, trying to fight through the hangover.
</DIRECTION>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Yes. Doug was with us. I tackled him...for some reason.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The guys nod, okay, okay.
</DIRECTION>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. So we only have a 13 hour window where we could've lost him.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They guys frown. Shit. Stu puts his hands into his pockets, thinking... Then he feels something. A matchbook. He pulls it out. It's from The Flamingo Nightclub.
</DIRECTION>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! Look, we were at the Flamingo.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A long beat of silence... Then the guys hurry to an empty BLACKJACK TABLE and start emptying their pockets of the detritus from the night before. They find matchbooks, receipts, room keys, a valet ticket...
</DIRECTION>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	ATM receipt from the Rio at 10:37--
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(reading it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For 600 dollars?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The valet ticket says we returned here at 4:57AM.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICK>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We drove last night?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The guys wince, jesus...
</DIRECTION>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's a receipt from Sbarro. The meal was comped for some reason--
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do we have a matchbook from The Golden Pony All Male Revue?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The guys exchange a look, alarmed.
</DIRECTION>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Someone could've given that to us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<STU>
<DIRECTION>
(laughing, nervous)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, totally! There's no way we went there! We're not gay! Hahaha!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They frown, then stare at all the clues lined up on the blackjack table.
</DIRECTION>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think we should call Tracy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Absolutely not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICK>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if Doug called her? She might know where he is.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Stu shifts uncomfortably, tenderly adjusting his ass.
</DIRECTION>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I'm with Alan on this one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STU>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course you're with Alan, you're both gutless cowards. But we're not calling Tracy. You never call the bride from the bachelor party. Ever. If my balls were on fire and Tracy was sitting next door with a tall glass of water, I still wouldn't call her. It's a rule.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICK>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But shouldn't we at least tell her we're gonna be getting home late?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She has a watch, she'll figure it out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICK>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I'm beginning to see why you're always single.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I think I'm beginning to see why you're always a douche--
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICK>
<STU>
<DIRECTION>
(clutching his ass)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guys, wait. I need your help -- oh my God -- like right now. Come on.

:SC: INT. BATHROOM -- MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vick and Alan unhappily stand in the lavish, gold-ensconsed men's room, watching Stu painfully undo his jeans.
</DIRECTION>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't believe we're doing this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICK>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't have to look up my butt, just at it. Something is terribly, terribly wrong...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Stu's jeans fall to the ground -- and everyone freezes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's wearing a snug FLUORESCENT PINK G-STRING with "I ROGER" written vertically down the front. In glitter.
</DIRECTION>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sweet mother of mercy...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's Roger?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICK>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I-I-I don't know?! What do you think it means?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STU>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do I think it means? Well, Stuart, your ass is all torn up and you're wearing thong underwear declaring your love for another dude -- I don't think we need the CSI team for this one! You got reamed last night, man!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Stu covers his mouth, horrified!
</DIRECTION>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sure there's a perfectly logical explanation for this...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really?! What?!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Alan tries to think of one.
</DIRECTION>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, maybe there isn't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I'm sure Roger is a very nice, considerate young man--
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICK>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God, guys: what if I'm gay?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STU>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Stu, you're nowhere near cool enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICK>
<STU>
<DIRECTION>
(gasping, realizing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do watch Dancing With The Stars with the kids!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STU>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh god, that doesn't mean you're gay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But sort of...it does?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Stu grows increasingly frantic.
</DIRECTION>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And once, I caught myself gazing at a topless photo of David Beckham!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STU>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what, he's a great-looking dude--
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And then I had those weird feelings for Vick that time in middle school, remember?!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone stops. Vick most of all.
</DIRECTION>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Um, what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICK>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, that weekend we were all camping -- I told you this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STU>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, no you didn't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICK>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STU>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I'd remember, dude.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICK>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I think we'd all remember.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. I had weird feelings for you that weekend. Like really hot, really gay feelings. But then they went away.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Vick is just looking at him, stunned.
</DIRECTION>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait -- I was there that weekend. Did you have gay feelings for me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Unbelievable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICK>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?! I was a good-looking kid!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, you're so not his type!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICK>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait, what?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Just then, a FATHER and his YOUNG SON enter the men's room and see Stu standing there, pants down, in his G string...
</DIRECTION>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Stu, one homosexual experience doesn't mean you're permanently gay, okay? A lot of guys test the waters.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
...the FATHER and SON wheel right back around and exit.
</DIRECTION>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, we're scaring the children. Let's go.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The guys head for the door. Stu quickly pulls up his pants.
</DIRECTION>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait -- so have either of you tested the waters?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STU>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! We're not gay!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICK>
<DIRECTION>
Stu looks highly confused as he follows them out onto
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CASINO FLOOR The guys power through the crowded casino, towards the exit. Stu tries to keep up, genuinely concerned.
</DIRECTION>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How am I going to tell my wife?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STU>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quickly, and from a great distance.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Alan's hand accidentally hits a brass railing and CLINKS...
</DIRECTION>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, what kind of father am I?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Alan's hand CLINKS against the railing again, and this time it registers. Alan looks down -- and stops cold.
</DIRECTION>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>

	You think Erin will try to take the kids--?

<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh...my...God.

</ALAN>
<VICK>
<DIRECTION>
(turning, annoyed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What now?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Alan holds up the source of his CLINKING: on his ring finger is a huge, tacky, silver WEDDING RING with a unicorn on it.
</DIRECTION>
<STU>
<DIRECTION>
(not getting it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cool ring. Also, my Dad is gonna have a field day with this.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Vick, however, recognizes the implications of the ring, and starts back towards Alan.
</DIRECTION>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God... Oh my God...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICK>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the big--?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(finally realizing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh! OH! OH!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STU>
<DIRECTION>
Alan steadies himself against a SLOT MACHINE, and shakily takes off the massive unicorn ring.
</DIRECTION>
<STU>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe it's not a wedding ring?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STU>
<ALAN>
<DIRECTION>
(reading inscription)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"To My Noble Husband, Alan."
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The guys eyes bulge, oh shit!
</DIRECTION>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is worse than my underwear!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Vick takes the ring and reads the rest of the inscription:
</DIRECTION>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Now & Forever Wedding Chapel."
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They guys exchange a look.
</DIRECTION>
<VICK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, at least it's a lead.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. Then Alan turns and THROWS UP all over the slot machine. Nearby OCTOGENARIAN SLOT PLAYERS look over, disgusted -- but continue playing their nickels.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. MANDALAY BAY -- VALET STAND -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The three guys exit the hotel looking like crap. Vick hands his ticket to the valet. Alan chews mint gum.
</DIRECTION>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, we go to the wedding chapel, we find out what we did with Doug, we recover him, and we're back in LA before sundown. Easy as Stu's ass.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
No one laughs. Tense SILENCE as they wait for the car.
</DIRECTION>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Check it out, some idiot threw his bed out the window last night.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Stu points over at a huge stone GRIFFIN in front of the hotel with an ENTIRE BED impaled upon its ear.
</DIRECTION>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was us, dude.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STU>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, there's no bed in Doug's room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<STU>
<DIRECTION>
(FROWNING)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Well, I'm sure we had a good reason for doing it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(BEAT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think they'll charge us for--?
	</DIALOGUE>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, Stu, I really do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guys, relax. Everything's gonna be cool...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Just then the Valet drives up in
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VICK'S DESTROYED CADILLAC The exterior is scratched and filthy, like it's been off- roading. The hubcaps are gone, as is the front passenger side door. A wisp of STEAM trails up from under the hood. The guys just stand there, agape.
</DIRECTION>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You okay, Vick?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STU>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not emotionally prepared to talk about it just yet, Stuart, but thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Vick dons his sunglasses and heads for his destroyed car...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE GUYS ROLLING DOWN THE STRIP in their ridiculous car. Cars full of FAMILIES, cute GIRLS, even NUNS, point and stare. Our guys just face forward, each quietly suffering in their own personal Hell.
</DIRECTION>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seriously: what am I gonna tell Becky? For 14 years she's been begging me to get married...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, now you did. Just not to her.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Alan glowers at the city going by... Then he sits up--
</DIRECTION>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait, is that homeless guy wearing Doug's shirt?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The guys turn to see a HOMELESS GUY weaving down the sidewalk in Doug's DISTINCTIVE ORANGE SHIRT from the night before. Once they pass, the guys exchange a look.
</DIRECTION>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Naaah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STU>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, that was a different shirt.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Alan doesn't look so sure. They drive in silence. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<VICK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Left turn.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Stu, sitting shotgun, braces against the empty doorframe so as not to fall out of the car as they turn left...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. NOW & FOREVER WEDDING CHAPEL -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sitting in an East Vegas strip mall, sandwiched between a laundromat and a pawn shop, is the pink Now & Forever Wedding Chapel. The Cadillac parks in the lot out front.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. NOW & FOREVER WEDDING CHAPEL -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everything in the small, tacky wedding chapel is white plastic. White plastic plants, white plastic cross, white plastic chairs. The guys enter.
</DIRECTION>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if they don't remember us--?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<VOICE_BEHIND_THEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	AAAAYYYYY!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The guys turn to find the hirsute owner of the chapel, STEVE GIANOPOLUS, 40's, in a tight white suit, his arms spread wide. Steve is all Vegas, by way of Long Island.
</DIRECTION>
<STEVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How are you, you dumb bastards?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVE>
<DIRECTION>
He warmly hugs the guys. They have zero memory of him, and it shows as they hug back weakly, unfamiliar...
</DIRECTION>
<STEVE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	CARLA, GET YOUR FAT ASS OUT HERE!
	</DIALOGUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	ALAN AND THE BOYS ARE HERE!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to the guys)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You here to pick up your wedding photos?!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Alan starts to decline, when--
</DIRECTION>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does the pope wear a funny hat?! Let's do this thing!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Steve CACKLES and guides them over to a table; Alan scowls.
</DIRECTION>
<STEVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And where is Chastity today?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They all sit on white plastic chairs.
</DIRECTION>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	W-Who's...Chastity?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<STEVE>
<DIRECTION>
(LAUGHING)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your wife, man--! AWW, you're just breaking my balls!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Alan looks ill. Laughing, Steve retrieves a folder and starts laying out a series of WEDDING PHOTOS on the table. Vick eagerly peruses them, enjoying this.
</DIRECTION>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, it was such a lovely ceremony, wasn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICK>
<STEVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hand to God, I've never seen two people more in love!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVE>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sadly, I believe you...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The guys look at the photos of Alan's wedding from the night before. They're typical wedding shots, only the guys are all wearing MEDIEVAL COSTUMES, swords, bows, tights, even armor. They look incredibly happy -- and incredibly drunk. The next photo is of Alan and his BUSTY BLONDE BRIDE. She's having a blast in a white medieval gown and tiara.
</DIRECTION>
<VICK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Chastity...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Alan just closes his eyes, oh God.
</DIRECTION>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am never...ever...drinking again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, she is stacked.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STU>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stu, please, show some class. That's Alan's wife you're talking about.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICK>
<STU>
<DIRECTION>
(to Alan, guilty)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry. She looks really nice.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
But Alan is too busy gaping at the next photo, of him and Chastity atop a UNICORN in the chapel. (It is, of course, a rented pony with a lame horn strapped to its head.)
</DIRECTION>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We got a unicorn?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<STEVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yeah, you got the entire Double Camelot Package.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Alan just rubs his temples, oh no.
</DIRECTION>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A-And how much did that cost?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<STEVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	7 thousand dollars.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Alan closes his eyes. Stu and Vick exchange a look, no way!
</DIRECTION>
<STEVE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, you didn't want to get it, either, but Vick insisted.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. Then Alan pounces across the table at Vick!
</DIRECTION>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm gonna kill you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<VICK>
<DIRECTION>
(fending him off)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't put a pricetag on love, Alan! OW! You just can't!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICK>
<DIRECTION>
Stu hops up and starts pulling Alan off of Vick.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE_BEHIND_THEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	STOP FIGHTING IMMEDIATELY!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The guys straighten like schoolboys as Steve's wife CARLA, 40's, enters. She's wearing a toga, smoking a menthol, and dollying in several large CARDBOARD BOXES. Then she grins:
</DIRECTION>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ahhh! I'm just busting your nuts!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She lowers the dolly and hurries over for hugs.
</DIRECTION>
<CARLA>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good to see you, you stupid mooks!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Stu and Alan force smiles, no idea who this woman is. Vick, on the other hand, steps forward and hugs her tightly.
</DIRECTION>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's good to be seen, Carla. It's good to be seen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICK>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I brought the rest of your package.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Carla begins unloading things from the cardboard boxes.
</DIRECTION>
<CARLA>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First: Two dozen commuter mugs...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She unpacks 24 COMMUTER MUGS with Alan and Chastity's photo emblazoned on them. Alan winces, oh god. Stu grabs one:
</DIRECTION>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No way! Awesome!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STU>
<STEVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A hundred DVDs of the ceremony...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She lays out the stacks of DVDs. Vick nods at Alan:
</DIRECTION>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For you and Chastity to watch on your anniversary...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Alan just clenches his jaw, I fucking hate you.
</DIRECTION>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The velvet wall hanging...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls out a six foot air-brushed velvet WALL HANGING of Alan and Chastity riding the unicorn together in outer space.
</DIRECTION>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And it looks like real velvet, Alan, so no machine wash, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICK>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the big finish:
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Vick and Stu do a DRUMROLL on the table, excited... Then Carla pulls out a FOUR FOOT BRONZE SHIELD with a bas- relief of Alan and Chastity MAKING OUT on it. Alan just closes his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	HOLY CRAP!
	</DIALOGUE>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	DUDE, YOU HAVE A SHIELD!
	</DIALOGUE>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want a shield!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STU>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me too! Hey, can Stu and I get a shield?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICK>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't suppose you have any sort of return policy, do you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<STEVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Um...if you know another couple who looks exactly like you guys, and who want two dozen commuter mugs, a wall hanging, and a shield...sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Alan scowls. Then his cellphone RINGS. He angrily answers it without looking at the Caller ID.
</DIRECTION>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
We hear someone YELLING AT HIM. Alan's eyes bulge.
</DIRECTION>
<ALAN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, hey Becky! Hi!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He steps away to take the call. Vick explains to Carla:
</DIRECTION>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's his girlfriend of 14 years. I'm sure this'll only take a minute...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICK>
<DIRECTION>
Vick and Stu go back to looking at the wedding photos as Alan tries to talk to his furious girlfriend.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERCUT WITH:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BECKY in her Laura Ashley bedroom, angrily packing up her suitcase. She's beautiful and preppy in pearls and a sweater set.
</DIRECTION>
<BECKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you tell me why all the goddamn credit cards are maxed out?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BECKY>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! I-I have no idea--!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Then Vick calls over from the white plastic table, pissed:
</DIRECTION>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	HEY ALAN, HOW COME I WASN'T YOUR
	</DIALOGUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	BEST MAN, DUDE!
	</DIALOGUE>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	YEAH, WHAT THE HELL, ME EITHER!
	</DIALOGUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	WHY'D YOU PICK DOUG?!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Alan waves at them, shut the hell up! But Becky has heard.
</DIRECTION>
<BECKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Your best man?!" What's going on there, Alan?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BECKY>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing! Baby, nothing, the GUYS
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	ARE JUST BEING DICKS!
	</DIALOGUE>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	HEY ALAN, YOU WANT ALL YOUR WALLET-
	</DIALOGUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	SIZED WEDDING PHOTOS, OR CAN I
	</DIALOGUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	BOGART A FEW?!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Alan furiously flips them off, shut up!
</DIRECTION>
<BECKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I really don't appreciate being mocked right now, Alan, especially about wedding-related issues. You know how hard this weekend is going to be for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BECKY>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know, baby! I know--
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<BECKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you'll call the credit card company and straighten this out?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BECKY>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. I will. I promise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<BECKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Okay...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat, calming)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, sorry I'm so tense... I'll see you soon, okay? Love you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
But Alan is just staring at the BRONZE SHIELD of him making out with his blonde bombshell wife...
</DIRECTION>
<BECKY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alan? Hello? I said I love you?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BECKY>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, no, I love you too!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Becky hangs up, rolling her eyes, unbelievable. STAY WITH ALAN as he closes his cellphone. Exhales.
</DIRECTION>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, how's Becky doing, man?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STU>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, did she ask about us?!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Off of Alan's hate-filled glare, we
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STEVE AND THE GUYS SCHLEPPING ALL OF THE WEDDING CRAP through the strip mall parking lot, back to their car. Alan sullenly carries the GIANT BRONZE SHIELD.
</DIRECTION>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look on the bright side, Alan. Vick found a great clue.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STU>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Turns out Doug was in all the wedding photos, which means -- if the time stamp was right -- we had him in our possession until 11 pm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICK>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's another hour of last night that we can account for. Isn't that great?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STU>
<ALAN>
<DIRECTION>
(bitterly sarcastic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Amazing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Steve, you don't happen to know where we were heading when we left here last night, do you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICK>
<STEVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, the Double Camelot Package comes with a five course wedding feast, so I assume you went there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVE>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great -- where was the feast?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STU>
<STEVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sbarro, over in the Fremont mall.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVE>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:

<ALAN>

(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I paid 7 grand for Sbarro?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. VICK'S CAR -- MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The beatup Caddy is packed with wedding crap. Vick is busy trying to reverse the overloaded car out of the parking spot. Stu's in the backseat with the huge shield, while Alan seethes up front.
</DIRECTION>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your negativity is like a little black cloud over our car, Alan. You've got to let go of this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICK>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let go of what, exactly, Vick?! The fact that I married a complete stranger last night? Or that my girlfriend's about to leave me? Or that I'm broke? Which one?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're broke? I thought you were
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	LOADED--
	</DIALOGUE>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know you think it's like terminally uncool to be in a committed relationship, Vick, but I actually love Becky, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<DIRECTION>
(SINCERE)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I-I honestly don't know what I'd do without her...I really don't...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Alan looks off, lost, sick. Vick stops the car short.
</DIRECTION>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alan. Honey. Have you considered, even for a second, that maybe the things we do when we're drunk are what we secretly want to do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICK>
<ALAN>
<DIRECTION>
(dripping with sarcasm)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, no, you're absolutely right, Vick, I've always secretly wanted to marry a bottle blonde with big fake melon tits named Chastity!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I ain't mad atcha, dude...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STU>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or, after 14 years, maybe you don't have the balls to leave Becky, and this is your way of getting her to leave you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICK>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was going to propose to her this weekend, you jackass!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All the more reason to freak out.
	</DIALOGUE>

Alan opens his mouth to respond, but nothing comes out. Vick nods, chew on that, and continues slowly reversing the car.
</DIRECTION>
<VICK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you, Alan Mervish, I do, but you've always had a major pole up your ass. Maybe last night was your inner cool person trying to get out-

	I swear to God, Vick, if you say one more word to me, I will destroy you.

	Guys, come on, let's not use our angry words--

SMASH! A baseball bat SHATTERS the windshield! The guys all jump! Vick slams on the brakes!
</DIRECTION>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the--?!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They look up to see two MASSIVE SAMOAN MEN in loud Hawaiian shirts, KALOLO FANALUA and KIKIOLANI, 30's, standing on either side of the car. And they look pissed.
</DIRECTION>
<KALOLO_FANALUA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get out of the car, Vick.

Stu and Alan recoil in terror.

Vick undoes his seatbelt and reaches for his door handle. Kikiolani lowers his bat -- and Vick throws the door open, right into his nuts! The huge Samoan staggers back, OWWW, and Vick slams his door shut and

FLOORS IT OUT OF THERE IN REVERSE! The Caddy sideswipes a car, hops the curb, and lands on the street! They SQUEAL AWAY, the huge bronze shield flying out of the backseat as they do! It CLATTERS on the pavement...

	Yeah, Vick, what's going on?

</STU>
<VICK>

	Nothing! I just think we should focus on finding Doug and not get distracted by every little thing!

	<DIALOGUE>
	Every little thing?! We were just assaulted by the Yakuza!

<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh please, those guys are from Guam. Get a grip.

</VICK>
<ALAN>

	They knew your name, Vick! Which means they probably know who Stu and I are, too!

	<DIALOGUE>
	If anything ever happened to my family, Vick...

</STU>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine. Let's just go back to the hotel -- Doug is probably back from wherever he spent the night, we'll get him, we'll straighten out whatever we did to those angry Samoans, then we'll get the hell back to LA, okay? Left turn.

Vick angrily takes a harder-than-necessary left turn. Alan hangs on tight, almost flying out of the car.

Alan quickly checks the room phone.

	No messages.

</ALAN>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, let's toss the place.

Alan starts wading through the crap in the living room, while Vick and Stu head off to check the bedrooms...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stu brushes aside beer bottles and room service dishes, looking for anything relevant. He spots a LEGAL CONTRACT on the ground. Picks it up.
</DIRECTION>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, check it out, Vick! I invested 30 grand in your custard store last night!
	</DIALOGUE>

Vick calls from the other bedroom.

<VICK>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Smart move, man.

<DIRECTION>
Stu opens the closet door -- and freezes.
</DIRECTION>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, you wanna come in here a sec?!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Vick enters a moment later to find Stu staring into the closet. Vick follows his gaze and sees a SEXY WOMAN snoring away on the closet floor, her blonde hair obscuring her face.
</DIRECTION>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICK>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think she's what those Guamian dudes wanted?

</STU>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I think she's Alan's wife.

Stu covers his mouth, oh shit! Vick produces the wallet- sized photos from Alan's wedding, compares them, and nods.

<VICK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alan? Wanna step in here, buddy?

A second later Alan enters, what's up?
</DIRECTION>
<VICK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alan, Chastity. Chastity, Alan.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Alan looks down, sees Chastity SNORING on the closet floor, her body all contorted, and freezes. Oh my God.
</DIRECTION>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What...what am I supposed to do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wake her up, man!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STU>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why me?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because she's your spouse, dude!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Scowling, Alan slowly crouches down. Then, a little scared, he nudges her. Nothing. He nudges her harder.
</DIRECTION>
<VICK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pinch her tit. It always works.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Alan shakes her a bit harder and -- BRRAPPPP -- the girl lets out a massive burp and awakens, COUGHING. Alan jumps back up, terrified. The woman, CHASTITY, looks around, disoriented.
</DIRECTION>
<CHASTITY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dang, did I sleep in the closet again...?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Then she notices the guys staring down at her. She smiles, recognizing them:
</DIRECTION>
<CHASTITY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh hey, guys! What's up?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She shakily climbs to her feet to expose a skimpy skirt, a snug tube top, and mascara smeared all over her face. The guys have no idea what to say. She kisses Alan on the cheek, very intimate -- like, well, a husband and wife.
</DIRECTION>
<CHASTITY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Morning, honey...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She exits into the living room, picking her wedgie. Beat. Alan is speechless.

<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She seems really cool.

	So, um, did you take Alan's name?

<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, are you Chastity Mervish now--?

</STU>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen to me. Just...did we, or did we not, have sex last night?

Alan braces, please say no, please say no... Vick braces, please say yes, please say yes...

<CHASTITY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well...ya?

Alan slumps, his life over. Vick pumps his fist, YES!

<CHASTITY>

	<DIALOGUE>
	But we waited til we were married.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Alan GROANS.

<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What a responsible, upstanding young Jew. They don't make `em like that anymore, am I right?

<DIRECTION>
Chastity smiles, sweet, as she straps on her 6 inch heels.
</DIRECTION>
<CHASTITY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know -- he even wanted to use a rubber.

Alan breaks into a COUGHING FIT.

<ALAN>

	Wait-- we didn't use a condom?!

Alan leans against a wall, dizzy.

Stu turns and tries to open a window. No luck.

<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They don't open.

</STU>
<CHASTITY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you guys don't remember any of last night?

(grabbing her sizable bra)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sucks, though. The wedding was really fun. I'm bummed you don't remember it, Alan.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles, a little saddened. Stu whispers to Alan:
</DIRECTION>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dude, I think your wife's mad at you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STU>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't happen to remember what time we met you last night, do you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICK>
<CHASTITY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, we met at the bar at like 10:00? Then we got married on my smoke break, which was like 11:00?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHASTITY>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the All-American love story, isn't it? What happened next?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICK>
<CHASTITY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I had to go back to work. But when I got off at 5:30, I met up with you guys back here.

</CHASTITY>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And was Doug with us then?

</VICK>
<CHASTITY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.

<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Interesting... Do you have any idea where we went after the wedding?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICK>
<CHASTITY>

Chastity leads the guys through Vegas's Most Notorious Strip Club, The Crazy Horse. It's bacchanalia writ large, complete with throbbing music, flashing strobe lights, and six stages of spinning flesh. The place is mobbed with PATRONS. Alan follows after Chastity, horrified.

Behind him, Vick SLAPS FIVE with Stu, psyched.

She stops at a pole, around which a BRUNETTE STRIPPER currently spins. Alan looks ill.

I'm sorry to bring Moshe Mervish into it, but it had to be said. Now yes, we have 18 hours to find Doug -- which means we can afford to spend ten minutes celebrating the special talents of these gifted young body-artists. So sit down, have a jager shot, and smell the goddamn roses for once in your miserable life. Chastity, honey? When you're ready?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Chastity pushes Alan onto the red leather banquette and starts dancing for him. He tries to squirm away:

SMASH CUT TO:

ALAN SITTING ON THE BANQUETTE, LOOKING AWESTRUCK as Chastity works a wildly erotic lapdance on him. She crawls onto his lap, she whips him with her long hair, she puts her tongue in his ear. Next to him, no longer getting lapdances, Vick and Stu just sit, staring at Chastity, entranced.

<STU>

More watching in silence.

<STU>

Then both of their heads angle the same way.
</DIRECTION>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not that can do that.

<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How can she do that without dislocating her hip?

</STU>
<VICK>

<DIRECTION>
They continue staring, amazed. Just then, the door is kicked open and KIKIOLANI and KALOLO FANALUA burst into the Champagne Room, peering through the darkness, looking for our guys. Vick and Stu see them immediately.

Vick literally yanks Alan up from the banquette.

<DIRECTION>
Finally, the Guamians spot the guys and lumber for them!

	<DIALOGUE>
	Chastity, honey, is there a back way out of here?!

Thinking fast, Chastity grabs her clothes and darts over to a darkened, unlabeled FIRE DOOR.

The guys race after her...

Chastity and the guys sprint through the bright, crowded back hallways of the Crazy Horse, weaving through strippers, cocktail waitresses, and barbacks. Behind them, the two massive Samoans try to follow, but are slowed by all the foot traffic. Strippers SCREAM as they're bowled over by the obese Islanders.

All the patrons turn their attention to Stage One -- then Stu blows through the curtain, out of breath. Beat. The patrons look at Stu, confused. Stu looks at them, equally so. The patrons start to BOOO, just as Vick, Chastity, and Alan blow through the curtain after Stu.
</DIRECTION>
<CHASTITY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on!

<DIRECTION>
Chastity, in six inch leucite heels, sprints down the main runway, leaps over the patrons sitting at the end, and hits the floor running!

</STU>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm really starting to like this girl.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The guys all follow suit, sprinting down the runway and leaping over the patrons! Then the Guamians blow through the curtain, panting, very upset. They lumber down the stage -- and the patrons at the end of the runway clear the hell out of the way.

	Perfect. We just told Tracy we'd have Doug home in 13 hours, and we still have no idea where he is...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They pass a DOORMAN on their way out, who's standing with a stamp and a UV light reader.
</DIRECTION>
<DOORMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Handstamp for re-entry? Handstamp for re-entry?

Everyone waves, no thanks -- except for Stu, who shrugs, why not, and stops, holding out his hand.

Stu holds his hand under the UV light -- it's covered in STAMPS from all the clubs they've been to the night before! Stu yanks up his sleeve to reveal his ENTIRE FOREARM GLOWS, completely covered with stamps! The guys hurry back and slide their forearms under the UV light, too: they all have the same stamps! Their eyes alight:
</DIRECTION>

Stu grins over at the car next to them. Then he stops.
</DIRECTION>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey: is that guy wearing Doug's hat?!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The guys look over to see that the DRIVER of the next car over is, in fact, wearing the DISTINCTIVE FEDORA-STYLE HAT Doug was wearing last night. The guy turns off the Strip.

<VICK>

	Naaah, couldn't be.

Chastity and the guys blow in, each with a photo of Doug (in medieval armor) from Alan's wedding. As they move into the club, every single waiter, bartender, and busboy sees them and throws open their arms, heyyyy, remembering them! They flash the picture of Doug to anyone who'll look -- waiters, maitre d's, thugs, bachelorettes, fetishists, bikers, swingers, brides and grooms -- but all of them shake their heads, we have no idea where Doug is...

<STU>

	All right, this is the last place we went, "Chaps."
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Vick rolls to a stop in front of...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHAPS NIGHTCLUB It takes a moment for the guys to realize that everyone in line is male, buff, and wearing erotic cowboy gear.
</DIRECTION>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sure we came here...?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Then they look up at the marquee. It reads "CHAPS: HOME OF

<DIRECTION>
The guys walk into the massive nightclub and stop. It's got a kitschy barn theme, and hosts 200 TOPLESS DUDES in cowboy hats and short-shorts grinding on each other.
</DIRECTION>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think we would've remembered this...

</VICK>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I don't think we came here...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STU>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then why is your underwear nailed to the wall?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The guys turn to see numerous pairs of MEN'S UNDERWEAR nailed to the wall nearby. A sign above it reads "CHAPS WALL OF FAME." We recognize Stu's COLORADO STATE BOXERS.
</DIRECTION>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those could be anybody's. Thousands of people go to Colorado State--

<DIRECTION>
Just then, a BUFF WAITER in assless chaps blows by, smiling.
</DIRECTION>
<WAITER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, guys! Roger is backstage!

The guys look at each other, eyes wide.

<DIRECTION>
She smiles and dances through the crowd.

They reach a HUGE MALE BOUNCER guarding the backstage area. He sees the guys and unclips the VELVET ROPE, kissing each of them on the cheek as they pass.

</DIRECTION>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're going to love you either way, Stu...

<DIRECTION>
Stu nods, focussed, nervous, like before a big game.

</STU>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not...not really? I live in Connecticut, man, we don't even have black people yet.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Stu nods, right. Then, after steeling himself, he enters...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. CHAPS -- DRESSING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dressing room is packed with muscular, tan, buck-naked men, walking around, rubbing baby oil on themselves, donning chaps and codpieces, getting ready for the next show.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chastity and the guys move through the mob of beefcake, staying ridiculously close together. Vick stops at one dancer, trying not to look down at his junk:
</DIRECTION>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me, friend, can you tell me where Roger is?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICK>
<BEEFCAKE_COWBOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, hey, Vick! Roger's over there.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He points to a really hot, really naked guy with a funky mullet, stretching out in front of his mirror. The guys shuffle over to him. Vick tries to be supportive with Stu:
</DIRECTION>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's cute...I guess...?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Stu shrugs, yeah, I guess...? As they draw close, Roger sees them, and smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh! Hey guys!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He hugs all of them. The guys make sure to keep their asses arched back to avoid genital contact.

	</DIALOGUE>
</VICK>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? No memory?

Stu shakes his head, wide-eyed, scared...

	Well, I must say, Stu, I'm a little hurt.

</STU>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, duh? Yeah?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<DIRECTION>
The guys all freeze. A beat. Then Vick pats Stu's shoulder, supportive.
</DIRECTION>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was I...the boy or the girl?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STU>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, honey, you were everything.

Stu WHIMPERS. Vick and Alan exchange a look, holy shit!

	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait-- what?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICK>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know, I'm sort of over group stuff too, but Alan insisted.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Now it's Alan's turn to look stunned.
</DIRECTION>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You insisted?! Why'd you insist?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICK>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know! I don't know why I insisted!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, after the anger went away, it was really quite tender.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The guys look at each other, nauseous.
</DIRECTION>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm really not sure we can be friends anymore...

Finally, Chastity starts LAUGHING.
</DIRECTION>
<CHASTITY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guys: he's kidding.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Roger breaks into a smile and slaps five with Chastity. The guys all exhale, incredibly relieved.

<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not cool, Roger. Not cool.

</VICK>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what did happen last night?

</ALAN>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, well, you guys came in near the end of our last set, like 2ish. Doug pretty much dragged you in.

</ROGER>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? Doug did?

</ALAN>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>

The guys nod, right.

	Anyway, for the big finale of our show, we always bring someone on stage, and, well, Stu, you volunteered pretty aggressively.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to nearby dancer)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey Dallas, do we have the video of last night's show?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! That's cool, I don't need to see it--

<VICK>

</VICK>
<DALLAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's in the machine.

<DIRECTION>
Roger nods and presses PLAY on a little VCR/TV combo sitting in front of his mirror. ON THE TV a very Brokeback, Chippendale's-style male revue starts playing. Stu GASPS. Roger fast forwards.
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were pretty mellow at first, Stu, but once we got you into the chaps, you really came alive-- oh, here it is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE TV we see Stu, wearing only his "I ROGER" g-string and assless chaps, grinding on stage with the Golden Pony dancers. He is way fatter, paler, and hairier than the greased young studs. The guys look away, oooo.
</DIRECTION>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a Dad, I-I don't get to the gym as much as I'd like...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STU>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You even taught us The Pony, which we'd never even heard of before...

<DIRECTION>
ON THE TV Stu gets on all fours on the stage, and eagerly gestures for the dancers to take turns "riding" him. Stu's face drops.

	<DIALOGUE>
	And then, of course, the pièce de resistance: the Ride of the Valkyries.

ON THE VIDEO Stu clutches onto Roger from behind as they ride a LAVENDER MECHANICAL BULL together. The crowd goes wild.

	<DIALOGUE>
	And our Doug was with us?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, he had passed out by then, but you carried him out. It was all very Officer And A Gentleman.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The guys look at each other, confused.
</DIRECTION>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait, so we left with Doug at 4:45, we got back to the hotel at 5:00, and Doug was gone by 5:30 when Chastity met back up with us?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That doesn't make any sense.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STU>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>

DOUG AND TRACY STILL KISSING at the reception. The entire wedding party is applauding.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHAMPAGNE IS UNCORKED and the WEDDING BAND kicks in. We are now down on the lawn, where white tables and a dance floor have been set up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STANDING IN THE BACK OF THE RECEPTION Vick, Stu, and Alan aggressively APPLAUD and WHISTLE for the bride and the groom.
</DIRECTION>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We did it, fellahs. We pulled it off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICK>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never had a doubt.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They LAUGH. Alan smiles, more relaxed than we've ever seen him. They sip champagne and watch Doug and Tracy enjoy their first dance on the dance floor.
</DIRECTION>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think Doug's ever going to talk to us again?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STU>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give him time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICK>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Like a decade or two--
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Then Stu sees someone approaching over Alan's shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh-oh.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The guys all look over to see
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BECKY Alan's girlfriend of 14 years, bearing down on them, irate.
</DIRECTION>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey Beck--!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICK>
<BECKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up, Vick! Alan, where the hell have you been?! I've been calling and calling! What, you don't answer your phone anymore?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BECKY>
<DIRECTION>
Alan shrinks down, back to being the chastised boyfriend.
</DIRECTION>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I-I'm so sorry, I can explain--
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Then there's a WOMAN'S VOICE behind them.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alan?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They all turn to see
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHASTITY standing behind them in a very sexy, very elegant dress, her hair back. She cleans up nicely. Alan swallows, whoa.
</DIRECTION>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This just got complicated...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICK>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jennifer?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Chastity smiles that he called her by her real name.
</DIRECTION>
<CHASTITY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I-I know I wasn't invited, but I just had to return this...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She hands Alan his GRANDMOTHER'S HOLOCAUST RING. Becky watches on, stunned.
</DIRECTION>
<BECKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay: who the hell is this chick, and why the hell does she have your Grandmother's wedding ring?!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Alan looks back and forth between Becky and Chastity... It's the moment of truth. The fork in life's road...
</DIRECTION>
<BECKY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Talk, you moron! Jesus, you're just like your mother! Talk! Who's the ho wearing my ring?!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
And in that moment, it all becomes so clear. Alan turns:
</DIRECTION>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's my wife.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Becky's jaw drops. Chastity smiles slightly. Stu and Vick grin, oh shit!
</DIRECTION>
<ALAN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We don't make each other happy anymore, Beck. And we can keep not making each other happy for another 14 years -- hell, maybe even another 50 years -- but let's not. Let's find people who make our hearts race. Let's be excited and fun and alive again...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Alan looks at Becky, sincere, honest. Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<BECKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you fucking kidding me?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Alan shakes his head, sadly, no.
</DIRECTION>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, Beck. I really am.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Chastity)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I buy you a free drink?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Chastity smiles, takes his arm, and they walk off together towards the bar.
</DIRECTION>
<CHASTITY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're not...actually...still married, are we?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHASTITY>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's start with dinner, and see where it goes...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<CHASTITY>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling warmly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHASTITY>
<DIRECTION>
BACK ON BECKY She finally recovers enough to speak:
</DIRECTION>
<BECKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alan! Alan Steven Mervish, get back here this second!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(but Alan keeps walking)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you walk away from me, you stupid little clown! I own you! GET
	</DIALOGUE>
</BECKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	BACK HERE IMMEDIATELY!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
But Alan just keeps walking away with Chastity. Vick and Stu wave him on, go dude! Go! Then Becky turns on them. Beat. They both scatter, terrified.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STAY WITH STU as he hurries off through the crowd. After a moment, he
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HEARS:
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Daddy?!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Stu turns to see his TWO ANGELIC DAUGHTERS in sundresses racing through the crowd towards him! They leap into his arms, so excited to see him! He scoops them both up.
</DIRECTION>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I missed you guys so much!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STU>
<HAYLEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We missed you too, daddy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAYLEE>
<KAITLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're the best dad ever!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. And then Stu just starts BAWLING. Tears everywhere. His lovely wife ERIN appears, harried, a diaper bag over her shoulder, and sees him crying. She rolls her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, are you still drunk?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Stu shakes his head, no, and keeps SOBBING as he pulls her into a big family hug...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. BEL AIR BAY CLUB -- MEN'S BATHROOM -- LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vick, a cocktail in hand, his tie undone, heads into the men's room and approaches a urinal. Then KIKIOLANI and KALOLO FANALUA walk in behind him, still in their huge arm casts, still very pissed. Vick inhales, scared.
</DIRECTION>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, okay, I'll go with you. Just...don't ruin the wedding.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Then JIMMY LANG enters the bathroom on RED CRUTCHES.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY_LANG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I really didn't want it to end like this, Vick.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Vick nods, resigned, and starts towards him. Then Jimmy extends his hand for Vick to shake.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY_LANG>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good luck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY_LANG>
<VICK>
<DIRECTION>
(totally thrown)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Um, what...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICK>
<JIMMY_LANG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your friend Alan just paid your marker. Took out a second mortgage on his house. The full 200 grand, plus medical expenses, which I thought was a classy touch.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Vick looks blown away.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY_LANG>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Without our friends, we are nothing, Vick. Remember that.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The three injured mobsters exit. Vick remains standing there, overwhelmed, his life literally saved...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VICK, STU, AND ALAN standing on the cliffs overlooking the Pacific, drinks in hand, as the wedding reception rages on behind them.
</DIRECTION>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will pay you back, you know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICK>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn straight you will!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They all LAUGH.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE_BEHIND_THEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, so what the hell happened this weekend?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The guys turn to see Doug approaching, smiling. They grin as he falls in with them, looking out at the calm blue ocean.
</DIRECTION>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Alan married a stripper, Stu went gay, and I learned a very important life lesson from an obese hoodlum.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICK>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll tell you the whole story when you get back from your honeymoon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STU>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We really are sorry, man.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Doug nods, I know. Vick raises his cocktail.
</DIRECTION>
<VICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To Doug and Tracy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICK>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To Doug and Tracy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STU>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To Doug and Tracy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To me and Tracy -- and to being here, with my three former best friends in the world...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The guys LAUGH.
</DIRECTION>
<DOUG>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's nowhere else I'd rather be right now.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They nod, heartfelt, hear-hear.
</DIRECTION>
<DOUG>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That said, let's not get too stupid tonight, okay? I'm going on my honeymoon in 24 hours...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The guys all nod reassuringly.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_GUYS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no. / We'll be good. / Totally, dude.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The guys exchange a sly smile, CLINK glasses, then
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO BLACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
