SUPER MAIN TITLES

<DIRECTION>
Over a grimy concrete wall creeping by. We emerge from...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RUNOFF TUNNEL - EARLY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A gaping hole in the concrete side of a freeway. On the embankment beside the hole BRENDAN FRYE squats, shoulders hunched. His dark eyes behind thin glasses watch the shallow stream of water which flows into the tunnel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE WATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
not more than six inches deep. Just beneath the surface a young woman's pale blue arm in gaudy bracelets bats against the edge of her body like a docked boat. A pebble plinks into the water beside it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TITLE CARD OVER BLACK: "2 DAYS PREVIOUS" INT. LOCKER CAGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A single locker. That same arm, bracelets and all, slips a note through the slats, then leaves quickly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the cage empties a lone figure slumps to the locker. Opens it. The note falls to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The figure is Brendan. He unfolds the note (folded in a triangle) -- "12:30 PICO & ALEXANDER".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A STREET SIGN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pico and Alexander. A WRIST WATCH 12:43. Brendan looks up from the watch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET CORNER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sits on the curb of a wide suburban street, eats lunch from a brown bag and watches a phone booth on the corner. He shows no surprise when it begins to ring. Brendan goes to the phone and puts the receiver to his ear. Silence for a moment, then a thin female voice from the phone.

<EMILY>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</EMILY>
<DIRECTION>
With a sharp breath the line clicks dead just as a black mustang roars by. Brendan drops the receiver and spins out of the booth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There, another pay phone up the hill -- empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan turns to the black mustang, far down the street. A man's hand drops a cigarette butt from the driver side window. The mustang turns the corner, gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan walks after it, finds the cigarette butt on the street. Still smoking. A pale blue arrow is printed on the filter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the distance the class bell rings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The high school is open air - the hallways are alleyways between buildings. A short kid with eyeglasses the size of

</BRENDAN>
<THE_BRAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help with what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_BRAIN>
<BRENDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. I don't even care, it's not my business. I just want to know she's ok, so I've got to find her. That's all this is.

</BRENDAN>
<THE_BRAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well. I know she was poking in with the Ivy-bound cheerleading elite. Laura Dannon's crowd.

Across the parking lot a beautiful girl with dark long hair kisses an football player.

	Laura Dannon there with the Rabbit?

</BRENDAN>

Brad laughs heartily.

	I won't argue then. Anyway Em tagged after them for a bit, but it didn't work. So she picked her way down the food chain. Last I seen she was with whasshername, that drama vamp. Small time dealer, augh, the evil one, the one you dated-

The Brain trots off. In the distance Brad and Laura laugh, and he kisses her. Her hair blows in the wind.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. LOCKER CAGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Empty. Locker 239 is open, its door swinging gently in the wind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BACK OF GYM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan sits against the massive building, flipping through loose papers. He finds two photographs, one of Emily hugging him, the other of Emily with a beautiful sharp-eyed girl at a party, drinks in hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sorting more papers, he finds a red card with a sequined mask on the front. The bottom edge has been torn off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY Sixth period has broke. Masses of students pile into busses.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. SCHOOL THEATER - DAY

A huge chunk of brown building. Brendan strides towards it.

<DIRECTION>
INT. SCHOOL THEATER - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Drama people sit on the floor facing the stage. Brendan steps behind one, the sharp-eyed girl from the picture. She holds a freshman boy's head in her lap. Pets it like a dog.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks back at Brendan, her face in shadow.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

	Way once, sister. You and Em were tight for a bit. Who's she eating with now?

INT. BACKSTAGE OF THEATER - CONTINUOUS

The play is seen in shadow-play through the backdrop.

Brendan slips in through an exit door, crosses the backstage area and enters the dressing rooms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cramped and empty. Pictures of Kara with friends are stuck in the mirror. Brendan roughly searches drawers, bags, pockets... nothing. He stops. A red edge behind one of the photos - the same red card with a mask on it, but whole. Across the bottom in small print: "Halloween in January - Call for DETAILS - 555-2394"

8:30 The desk is empty, Tetris paused. A shower runs behind an ajar door in the background.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. STOCKTON COVE GATE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An imposing private community gate. Brendan coasts up on his bike and ditches it in the bushes. He checks the call box directory: "42 -- DANNON"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Using the call box as a hand hold he hops the gate and walks briskly up the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STOCKTON COVE STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shiny cars line the curb. Party noises come from an upscale two story house. Brendan takes a short breath, then strides up to the front door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Large and clean, with a two story ceiling and a railed staircase at one end. Fifteen or twenty clean people, some in costumes, mill about in cliques. Brendan comes in as if he doesn't mind who sees him coming in. He gets a couple odd stares, but no one stops him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With non obtrusive confidence he cuts through the crowd to the beer keg in back and draws half a cup.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PARLOUR - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richly adorned, crowded, lit with bright pools of light. Brendan drifts in and stands in the back, deep in shadow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The music comes from a baby grand piano set against one wall. Laura Dannon leans against it. She wears a red kimono, and is striking against the velvet black piano. Laura's kid sister, 11 years old with glasses, sits at the piano playing "All I do is Dream of You".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Laura sings, lovely and soft but with strength. Brendan watches from the back, his face obscured in shadow, but his eyes gleam. Through the darkened window behind him a match flares up, and someone standing outside lights a cigarette.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Laura finishes the song. The room applauds, and she ruffles her kid sister's hair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan ducks out, and into
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME

<DIRECTION>
Brad Bramish, the jock who was kissing Laura in the parking lot, sits slouched on the couch in a dense crowd. He holds a cup and speaks much too loudly to a guy named Biff at his elbow.
</DIRECTION>
<BRAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If the coach wants to play me I'll play, but I can't put my best game in if I've got to worry about whether I'm going to be in there. Halftime last game, coach is pissed I ran it on a pass play, out on the field he says to me 'you gotta think about the team and you gotta' you know and 'if you run that ball again you're out', and I said to him you gotta let me play! I'm out there, let me play, and he's saying 'no you're out' and I kept saying 'Let me play! Let me play! Let me play!', just right in his face-

	<DIALOGUE>
	Just 'Let me play! Let me play! Let me play!' 'No you gotta' 'No, let me play! Let me play! Let me play!'
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAD>
<DIRECTION>
Brad hunches forward, his face swollen purple, yelling that over and over. Tom steps in front of Brendan, blocking his line of sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan scans the rest of the room. His eyes catch on Laura, leaning against a divan. Her bright, sharp eyes cut through the room, straight into Brendan. He wags his eyebrows at her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks away quickly. Brendan turns back to Brad, still shouting 'let me play'. Tom stands between them.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tom!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDAN>
<DIRECTION>
Brad falls silent. Most of the room follows suit. Tom turns around. Brendan smiles good naturedly.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDAN>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could you step aside, please? I'm trying to follow Brad's story, and it's difficult when I can't see his face.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDAN>
<DIRECTION>
The room watches Brendan. Tom mumbles something and steps aside. Brad stares at Brendan stupidly. Brendan flashes a dopey grin and tips his glass.
</DIRECTION>
<BRAD>
<DIRECTION>
(stumbles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He doesn't give me a play to make, what can I do, you know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAD>
<DIRECTION>
He falls into awkward silence. Biff starts babbling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan looks at Brad, who is staring back at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan then slowly drags his gaze over to Laura, staring at him too, her eyes slightly amused. Brendan cocks an eyebrow. The slightest hint of a smile takes the corner of her mouth, and she wags her eyebrows once at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan glances back at Brad, looking at Laura now, not amused at all.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan stands to go. Biff chatters on. Brad cuts him off.

INT. DARK ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a lit wet bar at one end. Brendan goes to the bar, puts ice in a glass and cracks it with liquor.
</DIRECTION>
<LAURA>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whiskey?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan pauses, glass touching his lips.

<BRENDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jameson.

</BRENDAN>

He downs half of it.

<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like a man who knows what he's drinking.

</LAURA>
<BRENDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a pretty sick thing to be attracted to.

They stare at each other in silence. She studies his face. The broken light of the bar makes her features seem liquid.

	Fearless flyer. Quit your yappin and fix me one.

He fills another glass with whiskey and cuts his with water.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. BACK PATIO - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan joins Laura, hands her a drink. Suburban lights fill the valley below. Laura sips her drink.
</DIRECTION>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll never get through all this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<BRENDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDAN>
<DIRECTION>
She sips more.
</DIRECTION>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I knew your old partner Jerr since grade school. Tough break. How long were you two joined up before your operation got the sting?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	BRENDAN
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A few months. Could have helped himself out by turning me in, but he took the heat. He was a good guy. Solid.

	<DIALOGUE>
	LAURA
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Was he?

	<DIALOGUE>
	BRENDAN

You knew him.

	LAURA
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Yeah I did. So why are you here tonight?

	BRENDAN

I'm looking for Emily.

She had an invitation.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	LAURA
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Well like you said, I've got to work on that. Em's been AWOL for a good month, nobody's seen her.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	BRENDAN
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
I saw her yesterday.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	LAURA
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Nearly nobody's seen her. So what did she tell you?

	<DIALOGUE>
	BRENDAN

<DIRECTION>
(winces) Score 0 for finesse.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	LAURA
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Listen, you're scratching at the wrong door. I wasn't with Emily enough to know details of what she was in, I just got wind of the downfall, and I didn't get any details of that, except that it was bad. So now that we're showing some cards...
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	BRENDAN
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
If you haven't got a finger in Em's troubles, why'd her name get me into your rather exclusive party?
</DIRECTION>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep up with me now. I don't know, but it sounded like you did, and a body's got a right to be curious. Now I'm not so sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<BRENDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well I'll put that body to bed. I don't know a damn thing about whatever troubles, and that works for me. I just want to find her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDAN>
<DIRECTION>
A long beat. Laura studies Brendan's face, then seems to come to a decision.
</DIRECTION>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Coffee and pie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<DIRECTION>
The words hang in the air a moment. A look of recognition from Brendan.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Coffee and pie oh my?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDAN>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you didn't hear it from me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<DIRECTION>
He sips his drink. A voice calls from the glass door. Another girl. Laura flashes Brendan a look and goes to her. They have quick, quiet words and the girl leaves. Laura turns back to Brendan.
</DIRECTION>
<LAURA>

(CONT'D) (cont'd)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you wait here for me?

</BRENDAN>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll stay right here and wait -- I'll be five minutes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<BRENDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDAN>
<DIRECTION>
The moment she leaves Brendan runs across the lawn and hops the fence, into the neighbor's yard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SIDE OF HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan runs to the edge of the neighboring house and peeks around. Laura comes out the front door, cuts across the lawn and sidewalk and trots out into the street. Brendan
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
begins to follow, but a noise from behind the fence stops him - a match being struck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan creeps towards the fence and peers through a splintered hole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BRENDAN'S POV - THROUGH THE FENCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A brightly lit window in the side of Brad's house, and through the window the party.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A dark figure wearing a long coat and broad rimmed hat, all inky black. The figure smokes a cigarette and watches the party, absently stroking his cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan steps back - SNAP! A twig.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The figure freezes. Then, making no noise at all, it spins to face Brendan, a towering black form against the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The glowing cigarette falls to the grass. A metallic glint, and a clicking sound not unlike a gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan throws himself backwards onto the grass. A beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the hole the black of the figure's cloak whips away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan hesitates, then hops the fence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SIDE OF BRAD'S HOUSE - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan lands on his feet. No black figure to be found.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cigarette still smolders on the ground. Hand rolled, plain paper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan gazes through the window, catching his breath. Then he breaks the trance and creeps towards the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FRONT LAWN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Peeking around the house, Brendan sees Laura cut across the lawn and trot into the street. Using parked cars as cover, Brendan follows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Between cars, Brendan sees a lanky kid in baggy jeans and engineer boots with a clean shaven head leaning against a black Mustang. Laura goes to him and speaks quickly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dark figure in the hat emerges from the shadows. Laura says something to him. Grunting something angrily, he gets in the car with the bald kid and peels off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Laura turns and slowly walks towards the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When she is gone Brendan stands, throws a look back at the house and walks off down the street, towards the guard gate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BACK PATIO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two drinks, where Brendan left them. Laura takes hers and drains it. The suburban lights twinkle like stars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CARROWS PARKING LOT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sun rises over Carrows family restaurant, a squat structure backed against the weedy edge of the runoff tunnel ravine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A banner from 1973 in the window - "Coffee and Pie oh my!" A pack of six pale stoners slump against the rear dumpster. Their beady eyes follow Brendan in sync as he approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He goes to the nearest one.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's Dode?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDAN>
<STONER_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dunno, bra.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STONER_1>
<DIRECTION>
Silence and blank stares. Brendan calmly moves to the next stoner.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dode?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDAN>
<STONER_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh uh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STONER_2>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan moves to the next one.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A thin head pokes from around the dumpster.
</DIRECTION>
<DODE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey Brendan. Maybe you shouldn't be here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DODE>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan steps around the dumpster. Dode slumps against the wall, thin and delicate in dusty black. Slivery eyes, pale lips, muffled intelligence.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kara told me you know where Em's at.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDAN>
<DODE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh huh. And why are you looking for Em?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DODE>
<BRENDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She asked for my help.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDAN>
<DODE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh huh. Listen man, I've got plenty on my plate without dealing with some jilted ex.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DODE>
<BRENDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not about that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDAN>
<DODE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever it's about, act smarter than you look and drop it.

</DODE>
<BRENDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is she?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDAN>
<DODE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's with me, and right now that's the best place for her. Leave the low life to the low lifers and dangle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DODE>
<BRENDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're on the bright side of dim, Dode, but if I thought you had this half- handled I'd be eating lunch. Where's she at?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDAN>
<DODE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Better get while it's good.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Heel it now, dig?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The 5 big stoners appear behind Brendan, threatening. Dode turns his head away to light a joint.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan's fist slams into his face, sending the joint spinning. Brendan slams Dode's frail frame against the dumpster.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The 5 stoners stand in the exact same position, deer in the headlights. One makes a half hearted motion to intervene.
</DIRECTION>
<BIG_STONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Back off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIG_STONER>
<BRENDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Throw one at me if you want, hash head. I've got all five senses and I slept last night, that puts me six up on the lot of you.

	<DIALOGUE>
	She's with me. She was tight when she called you, man. Came to and freaked. She told me to shake you if you came by. Said you'd only make things worse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DODE>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan covers how shaken he is by this statement fairly well. He drops Dode.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Put him down, man!

	Tell Emily I want to see her. Tell her if she still wants my help or not that's her business, but I want to hear it straight from her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDAN>
<DODE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She don't -
	</DIALOGUE>
</DODE>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan walks away.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Today. She knows where I eat lunch.

When Brendan is a safe distance away the biggest stoner shouts with conviction
</DIRECTION>
<BIG_STONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And stay out, punk!

<DIRECTION>
EXT. SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan hides behind a tall clump of bushes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A moment later Dode hustles away from Carrows. Brendan follows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - EARLY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sun is rising as Brendan tails Dode through the twisty suburban streets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan takes cover as Dode stops by a white hatchback.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A girl gets out of the car and embraces Dode. Her wrist is adorned with the same cheap plastic bracelets as the dead girl's arm. Dode speaks quickly to her, she nods and speaks back. He hands her a slip of paper, which she tucks into a brightly colored address book and slips in her jacket pocket. They embrace again, Dode walks off and the girl gets in her car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan stumbles after the car, but it is quickly gone. He watches it go, then follows Dode back towards school.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SCHOOL THEATER - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dode slumps into the front door of the brown building. Brendan watches him from a distance, eyes thoughtful. After a beat he turns and walks off into the thickening crowds of students.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE UP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BACK OF SCHOOL - MIDDAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan eats lunch alone on a concrete wall beside a long, empty utility road behind the school.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reclining on the wall, reading "Lord of the Flies". He raises his eyes, and sits up suddenly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Off in the distance on the utility road a tiny figure approaches, stumbling. Brendan jumps and hits the ground running towards the figure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meet the girl with cheap bracelets, the girl Dode spoke to, the dead girl, Emily. He catches her just as she stumbles and falls and carries her into the shade of a covered hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Emily and Brendan sit in silence. She is very pretty, but she looks bad. Too much makeup, not enough sleep. She sniffles, speaks to her shoes.
</DIRECTION>
<EMILY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I must have sounded pretty crazy on the phone. Yesterday.

She turns her weak eyes to Brendan for the first time. His stare is unwavering, searching. She pushes on.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Brendan, I know you're mad at all these people, cause you think I went away from you and went to them. But you've got to start seeing it as my decision, stop being angry because where I want to be at's different from where you wanna be at.

	</DIALOGUE>
</EMILY>

A beat. She taps her clogs. One has a hole worn through the sole. Her face contorts, seizes up, and she is sobbing.

INT. CLASSROOM

<DIRECTION>
Brendan sits in the back, flipping through the address book. The teacher drones on about the significance of the pig's head in "Lord of the Flies".THE ADDRESS BOOK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Illegible scribbles, names, numbers, nothing that stops his search - then the note Dode gave her, a corner of loose-leaf paper which looks like this:

Brendan studies the paper intently.

	When the upper crust does shady deeds they do them in different spots around town. I know under the pier's one, down by the bike trails in the state park's another. There's alot of them. The pitch is they've got little symbols for each one, and that's how they tell each other the place, so word won't get around. So this might be that.

INT. BRENDAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Sparsely furnished. Brendan plays Tetris on his computer, staring off into space. His mom's voice calls "Good night" and the hallway light turns off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
10:30 by the clock radio on Brendan's nightstand. The slip of paper rests beside it. Brendan lies in bed, staring at the symbol on the paper. His eyes tense.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SYMBOL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Growing larger, burning with a searing intensity, then folding into darkness. Water rushes overhead, over concrete, concrete with a hole in it -- the runoff tunnel, just for an instant, then back underwater, screaming. Brendan choking, screaming, plunging upwards. A woman with no face falls from the darkness and kisses him, her long hair sweeping around him then pulling away. As the last strands slide off his face he wakes up with a start.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The clock says 3:46. Brendan drips with sweat, breathing raggedly. He takes the paper and a pencil from the nightstand and shades the symbol to look like this:

FLASH CUT - The runoff tunnel, lining up perfectly with the now shaded symbol.

<DIRECTION>
BACK TO BRENDAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes turn uneasy as he removes his glasses and clicks off the light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BRENDAN'S HOUSE - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan walks off into the hazy pre-dawn light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. EDGE OF RAVINE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan stops at a high wall of weeds, listening to the low gurgle of moving water. Slowly, robotically he pushes through.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EMILY'S BODY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Face down, bobbing gently in shallow water. Bluish white. Red foam clings to her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RUNOFF TUNNEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Silently, as if lowered by a string Brendan sinks down, squatting in the mud. His lungs empty in one choppy breath. He pulls his glasses off sluggishly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EMILY'S ARM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lifeless, pale.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BRENDAN'S FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A contorted, frozen mask, eyes wet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EMILY'S HAIR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stringy, flowing gently in the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BRENDAN'S EYES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dazed, drifting... then suddenly snapping to attention.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A noise. From the tunnel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan freezes. The inky blackness of the tunnel mouth opens like a vacuum... silent, but then -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The scrape of a shoe against concrete, then echoing footsteps running away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan springs like a cat, sprinting into the tunnel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TUNNEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nearly pitch black. 2 sets of running footfalls. Brendan is chasing, running full speed into the blackness, heart pounding - we almost don't notice that Brendan's are now the only footfalls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan notices. He stops. Silence in the darkness, except for Brendan's breath... and someone near...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SLAM! Brendan takes a fist in the cheek and goes down. An inky black figure steps from the shadows and kicks him in the stomach. Brendan curls on the ground, the figure over him.
</DIRECTION>
<FIGURE>
<DIRECTION>
(low whisper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your little Em.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FIGURE>
<DIRECTION>
The figure runs off. Brendan raises his head painfully - the figure is silhouetted briefly against the distant bright end of the tunnel, then is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RUNOFF TUNNEL - EARLY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Emily's body is still there. Brendan crawls out of the tunnel and collapses in the shallow water, beside the body. He rests his head on his arm, eyes on Em's hair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CAMPUS - EARLY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cold and barren, nearly empty. Brendan limps across the barren lawns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PHONE BOOTHS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A line of phone booths on campus. Brendan nearly collapses against one. He dials, still in a stupor.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE_ON_PHONE>

	Saint Clement police.

Early morning mist below a squat brick building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIBRARY
</DIRECTION>

Warmly lit, sheltering the few souls scattered here and there at tables. The Brain sits at one of them reading an impossibly large book. He watches curiously as Brendan approaches him.

</THE_BRAIN>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan puts on his glasses, stands to go.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, bulls would gum it. They'd flash their dusty standards at the wide-eyes and probably find some yegg to pin, probably even the right one. But they'd trample the real tracks and scare the real players back into their holes, and if we're doing this I want the whole story. No cops, not for a bit.

EXT. BASKETBALL FIELD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A vast field of asphalt segmented by a dozen basketball courts outlined in cracked paint.1 Brendan trudges across it, his steps heavy. He stops and stands very still, staring at the ground for a beat then raising his eyes to
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE HORIZON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flat, gray, pin straight. Brendan's voice starts speaking rapidly, confident and clear.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDAN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah it was personal. Jerr spooked some decent gees and ran around some what was straight with him, but I'm nobody's bull runner. This wasn't a business sit. But yeah. I bulled him. Got in tight, partnered up and sent him over.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDAN>
<DIRECTION>
PAN AROUND to reveal BRENDAN. He looks different, edgier, more alive, wearing different clothes and a thin goatee1. He keeps talking directly at us.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDAN>

	I'd bull the lot of them, Em, I'd burn down the whole party if they tried to play you again. Jerr and whoever's next. I want to keep you safe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDAN>
<DIRECTION>
An ARM swings into frame, wearing cheap plastic bracelets and pale blue fingernail polish. It slaps Brendan hard in the face. He catches it. Emily wrenches her arm away and stumbles backwards onto the pavement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan grabs her sleeve. She twists away. He grabs her shoulder, grabs her waist, she resists, and suddenly they are struggling with violent pent up intensity until with a shout she breaks away and falls to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. Gulls cry in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<EMILY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't keep me safe, Brendan. I'm in a bigger world now, and you can't hide me from it, and you can't beat it. Not if I don't want you to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMILY>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan's face looks lumpish, while Emily's is strong. She stands and walks off into the distance across the barren field.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BRENDAN'S FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watching her go. It is back to present day, pale, clean shaven, sullen. His eyes are cold with resolve.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RUNOFF TUNNEL - EARLY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan sloshes down into the water. Without delicacy he lifts Emily's body and pulls her back into the tunnel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RUNOFF TUNNEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pitch back. Brendan lays the body down. Two beady eyes peer at him from the darkness - he freezes. The eyes hop forward - a gull. The two watch each other for a moment, then the gull squawks and flutters out the bright mouth of the tunnel. Brendan follows it without looking back at the body. EXT. CROWDED HALLWAY - DAY

Brendan and the Brain lean against a wall. The Brain slips him a piece of paper.

Ask any dope rat where their junk sprang they'll say they scraped it from that who scored it from this who bought it off so, and after four or five connections the list'll always end with the Pin. But I'll becha you got every rat in town together and said 'show your hands' if any of them've actually seen the Pin, you'd get a crowd of full pockets.

Brad Bramish sits slouched in the front seat of his convertible, front door open. A small crowd hangs about Brad, his crony Biff at his elbow.

Brendan stands and walks off. Brad follows and the rest of the crowd trails after him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He leads them behind a parked VW van and turns to face Brad. People gather around in a wide circle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan pulls his jacket off as Brad hangs back, mumbling.
</DIRECTION>

Laura pulls up in her convertible, behind Brad, watching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the next moment Brendan cuts Brad off by putting his fist in his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brad grunts but doesn't lose ground. Brendan throws his short stocky frame into Brad's larger one and tenderizes his midsection with jabs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brad tags Brendan in the ribs, then smacks the palm of his hand into Brendan's face, shoving him back onto the pavement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He comes at Brendan with his big fists clenched.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan kicks Brad full force in the shins.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brad tumbles, and Brendan comes up fast, connecting hard with the point of Brad's chin. Brad gets his balance fast, and before Brendan can throw another he throws one himself, then another, both into Brendan's stomach. Brendan pulls back and kicks Brad's shin where he had kicked it before. Brad roars and hits Brendan very hard in the face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan bounces back like a rubber ball and throws his weight into a square punch right into Brad's nose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of eggs breaking, and Brad falls backwards like a board.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stays down, holding his face.

Brendan staggers back, breathing hard, and looks up at the small crowd. Some stare at Brendan, some at Brad, but nobody seems about to do anything. Brendan runs his sleeve over his face and walks unsteadily off, pushing past the last few people rushing over.

<BRENDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Brad's a sap. I downed him on his field and his crew didn't bite. So now I know he's a sap and anyone who acts like he isn't is profiting by it. That's not why I roughed him, though.

</BRAIN>
<BRENDAN>

	Economics. Brad's the school's biggest jake buyer, so if this Pin is behind all the selling, I just got his attention. Anyway, now's just shaking things out. Look, you know a kid around the burgh, lanky, short, shaved head, turns a black tang?
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Brendan hangs up and turns sluggishly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A lanky kid with a short shaved head and engineer boots punches him in the face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan hits the pavement. The lanky kid is over him in a split second, beating his face and body with short, heavy blows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flashes of the lanky kid - a shiny scar shaped like a thin triangle runs down the side of his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a brief silent thrashing the kid walks off with several other blurry figures. A car peels out and roars off O.S.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan lies still. The class bell rings, very distant. Legs criss cross before his eyes, each blurring the world a bit more until it is completely smeared.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

	Hold it, I could - hold it - could write you up for talking back to a VP. For looking at me in a threatening way. I'd exercise a little more tact, Mr. Frye. You can't pull a play like that unless I need you for something. So do I?

But if anything comes up with your fingerprints on it, I can't help you. Also, if I get to the end of whatever this is and it gets hot and you don't deliver, The Veep will need someone to hand over, police- wise. And I'll have you.

EXT. SIDEWALK - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bordering a supermarket. Brendan trudges along. Suddenly he stops. Parked in the supermarket parking lot is a black mustang.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARKING LOT - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sun hangs low. Brendan approaches the car and walks around it slowly. He peers inside. A tuft of paper pokes out from under the seat. He pulls the door handle, locked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan picks up a broken chunk of concrete from the ground, waddles over to the car and holds the chunk above his head, ready to drop it through the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stops. His eyes catch something in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lanky shaved-head kid, whose name is Tugger. Coming towards him fast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan stands there for a moment, then lets the chunk fall to the ground. He casually leans against the car, removes his glasses, puts them in a hard case and puts the hard case in his pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tugger hits him like a train and throws him across the pavement. Tug turns back to the car and takes out his keys.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan gets up and comes towards Tug, his face stiff. Tug turns and pops him once squarely in the mouth. Brendan falls to his knees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
While Tug unlocks the door Brendan stands up woozily. Grunting, Tug spins and grabs Brendan's jacket, pushing him back while he slaps him hard in the face, back and forth, three times. When Tug lets go Brendan drops like a stone, catching himself on his hands and knees. The car door slams.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The mustang drives about a hundred yards out into the parking lot, spins around and stops, facing Brendan. Its motor purrs deeply. Brendan begins to limp towards it doggedly, head up, eyes fixed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A crackling roar and short squeal of tires spit the mustang forward. It comes straight at Brendan, rumbling like a tank.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan stops walking and stands very still, eyes steady. The gap between him and the car closes in no time at all.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It speeds past him not six inches to his left, brushing the edge of his jacket. Brakes squeal behind him. Brendan turns and lopes towards the mustang, idling about fifty feet away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stops at the window. Tugger eyes him curiously, with some respect.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to see the Pin.

EXT. STREETS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Twisty and narrow. The black mustang flies through them at impossible speeds, roaring past like a bullet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DARKNESS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Loud engine noise, jostling, grunting. Then a metallic jangle, some scraping, and a CLINK!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. REAR OF FAST MOVING MUSTANG - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The trunk pops open, revealing Brendan holding a jack rod.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOVING MUSTANG - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tug is putting a tape in the deck, eyes down. Behind him the trunk pops open, then pulls down out of sight just as he looks back up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRUNK OF MOVING MUSTANG Brendan holds the trunk about three inches open, just enough to see which street signs pass by. Loud music plays from the car -- "Sweet Baby James" by James Taylor. The car zooms on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BRENDAN'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the ajar trunk. The mustang slides to a stop beside an elaborate wooden mailbox carved as an eagle's head. Brendan closes the trunk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FRONT OF HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small one story house, slightly run down. Tugger opens the trunk and drags Brendan out, covering his eyes with a palm, slams the trunk and goes inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When they are gone the broken trunk drifts open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A very dim narrow hall with a steep stairway at one end, dark doors down the length of it and a lit door at the other end. Tugger drags Brendan down the stairway, drops him and goes into the lit room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan lifts his head painfully. Surrounding him in the darkened doorways are dozens of boys, some dressed like Tugger, others dressed in black.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tug pokes his head out.
</DIRECTION>
<TUGGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright.

</TUGGER>
<DIRECTION>
Arms pop out of the darkness and drag Brendan towards the lit room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KINGPIN'S DEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small room, amazingly messy. Clothes strewn about, groves of empty bottles, precarious piles of books. The overall impression though is not of jumbled chaos, but of a nest, comfortably woven and very worn in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A slim figure with wispy hair sits facing the wall at a small desk, writing under a green bookkeeper's lamp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan is shoved into the center of the room. Tug and his clones slump against the surrounding walls. Brendan watches the thin figure's back. For a beat the only noise is the scratching of the thin man's pencil. Then he sighs and swivels around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mid to late twenties. Sallow features, tired eyes. His clothes are so richly black it is difficult to make out specific items -- he is just one inky black mass from the neck down and eyebrows up.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright, let up.

But Tug doesn't let up. Brendan's world grows hazy, the cackling laughter reverberates, then a clean voice pierces the din.
</DIRECTION>
<LAURA>
<DIRECTION>
(OS)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tug, stop.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<DIRECTION>
Tug's face breaks for a moment, and he lets go. Brendan's head lolls to the side. Laura stands in the dark doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan sees Tug's knuckles and a flash of white for a split moment as Tug hits him in the face. The Pin's black body spills out across the frame, leaving us in black.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE UP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SMALL DARK ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan wakes up curled on a mattress on the floor. A bare light bulb hangs from the ceiling. Tugger sits five feet away, watching him like a hungry dog. Brendan stares back at him through thick, glazed eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are my glasses?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Tugger grins)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hell with ya then. Which wall's the door in?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDAN>
<DIRECTION>
Tug points, amused. Brendan heaves himself up, and Tug shoves him back down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan winks at him, stands and lurches towards the door again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tugger grabs his shirt and slams him into the wall, but freezes when he hears a door latch click. Sneering, he drops Brendan back onto the mattress and sits against the opposite wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sounds of a door opening and closing come from the darkness. Light footsteps clack on the cement floor. Suddenly Tug vanishes -- the room's darkness just seems to swallow him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The thin whispery voice of the Pin speaks softly.
</DIRECTION>
<PIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry about this kid, but what the hell with what you said before.

His disembodied face appears a few feet about where Tug had sat.

But nuts isn't all bad, so maybe it was a good play. I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIN>
<DIRECTION>
He is standing in front of Tug. His black clothes and broad rimmed black hat blend perfectly with the dark room, such that his face seems to bob about in space. Brendan stifles a cough.

Brendan sits at a breakfast table eating cornflakes. The kitchen is on the first floor of the Pin's house, or rather the Pin's mother's house. She is a soft old lady in a pastel cotton dress, currently bent over the fridge mumbling.
</DIRECTION>
<MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought we had orange juice, Brendan, I'm sorry. How about Tang, or that's more like soda isn't it, or not soda but it hasn't got any juice in it, it can't be very fortifying.

<BRENDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Water's fine, ma'am, thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDAN>
<MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now just a moment, we have apple juice here, if you'd like that, or milk, though you've got that in your cornflakes, I don't know if drinking it as well might be too much.

She shuts the fridge. Tugger and the Pin sit behind her, looking comfortably bored. The Pin, a sharp black hole against the soft yellow kitchen, eats oatmeal cookies with small delicate bites.

The Pin and Brendan are perfectly still, watching each other.

	Till he took the fall for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIN>
<BRENDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah well. I didn't ask him to, but he was a straight player. I got out clean - almost. Nothing on my official record, but the VPs play it like I owe them one. When I made it clear I wasn't playing their hound dog, well they didn't like it. They keep calling me in, badgering me.

Laura's convertible stops, and Brendan climbs out painfully. He studies her face for a moment.

<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You trust me now?

Brendan leans on the car, his face close to hers.

<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm on the in, top level of the tower and I know everyone, but I don't know all what goes on. I knew Em when she tried to get with me and Brad, and I liked her. She was smart. But she wasn't us, and it didn't work. When she left she took some souvenirs, dirty habits she wasn't strong enough to control and a connection to the Pin to keep them going. With me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<BRENDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So far.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDAN>
<LAURA>

	A few months go by, and the next I hear the Pin's raging over a situation with some certain junk Em was partial to, and the downfall's coming on Em's head.

</LAURA>
<BRENDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think Em scraped the junk off the Pin?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDAN>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know, but whether she scraped or copped or just ran her tab around the world and into her own back, it must have been grand. I've never seen the Pin so hot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<BRENDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This all helps but it's not what I asked. What's your angle in all this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDAN>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. I'm usually pretty sharp, but... maybe I see what you're doing for Emily, trying to help her. And I don't know anyone who would do that for me.

INT. WOMAN'S DRESSING ROOM

Hazy and cramped. Everything blends into the color of flesh. No walls are visible; it is all billowy piles of costumes. Brendan pushes in. Kara sits at the mirror, putting on eyeliner.

	Uh huh. Laura's working with me now, and I'll have the Pin and Tug in my corner soon. The sooner I get the truth from Dode or the truth about Dode from you, the safer you'll both be. No? Pass it on to Dode anyway. Maybe he'll have the

	<DIALOGUE>
	So what happens now?

	Now we wait for the Pin's answer. Unless his crew spotted VP Truman's social call this morning, it'll be yes. I'd give us 70/30. If we're in I get under his skin and see what's what. You stick to Kara, keep your specs peeled for Dode and stay away from Laura.

The Brain is quiet for a beat.

A beat of silence.

</THE_BRAIN>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan gently replaces the receiver and sits for a moment in silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LOCKER CAGE - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The class bell rings, and the cage quickly empties. Brendan limps in, opens his locker. A note falls to his feet. It is folded into a star. He pulls it open. "TWELVE THIRTY PICO & ALEXANDER". He fishes the old note out and compares them - different handwriting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The locker cage is now empty and silent, except for the steady sound of heavy footfalls. Brendan looks up from the notes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A lug with a lumpish face is coming towards him. He wears a black trenchcoat over bulbous shoulders, and his black hair comes down over his eyes like a sheepdog's.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You the Pin's?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDAN>
<DIRECTION>
No answer. The lug keeps coming.

<BRENDAN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what's his answer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDAN>
<DIRECTION>
Closer, not slowing. Brendan tightens his hand into a fist. Then CLICK! and a long slender switchblade gleams in the lug's right paw.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan jumps back as the lug swipes the blade at his torso. Before the lug winds up for another slash Brendan is running.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CAMPUS SQUARE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan runs through the empty campus square, the lug follows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wind rushing, sweating, the lug very close. Their footsteps clatter on the cement. Brendan swings around a corner, doubles back and stops with his back to a wall - he's lost sight of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan sweats, listening. The lug's footsteps echo through the hallways, coming from all directions at once. Then it seems clear - he's down the hall on Brendan's right. Brendan dashes left. Wrong. The lug looms over him, his knife hand flashing. Brendan's jacket shoulder tears open, and the white filling inside turns red. He stumbles back blindly, gets his footing and scrambles out of reach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan sprints away, down the hall, gaining about thirty feet on the lug before turning the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan drops to a sitting position.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE LUG AROUND THE CORNER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Running fast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BRENDAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kicks his shoes off and clambers to his feet. The lug's footsteps are impossibly loud.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE LUG
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just about to round the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BRENDAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On his socked feet running silently back towards the corner. The lug's footsteps crash like symbols as they both come around the same corner in opposite directions at full speed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan slides like a baseball player, tangling his legs into the lug's. The lug pitches forward with frightening momentum. He hits the hall's metal handrail with his arms and head. A hollow gong reverberates through the hallway, and the lug falls like a puppet with his strings cut. A wallet with a couple of twenties and a student ID (CHUCK BURNS), three hash pipes, fifteen joints, a baggie of weed and a large brownie in another baggie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan leaves it all on him and staggers off.

	Never mind. If I don't call by three call in the bulls.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDAN>

Brendan hangs up and begins walking at a normal pace along the sidewalk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cady pulls up beside him, and he stops walking. The door swings open and a voice comes from inside.

With no perceivable hesitation, he does.

INT. CADILAC - DAY

Brendan sits beside the Pin. The windows are tinted and the car is very dark. The seats are pink vinyl. The car lurches forward. Brendan and the Pin are silent for a beat, not looking at each other.

EXT. THE PIN'S HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bird of prey mailbox looms ominously. Brendan knocks on the front door. No answer. He presses lightly on the screen door, and it gives.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Empty. Brendan crosses the warped linoleum and gently opens the narrow basement door. He descends into inky gloom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - SAME Deathly still and silent. Barely breathing, Brendan goes to the lit doorway at the end of the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PIN'S DEN - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Empty. Brendan floats through the room like a ghost, to the Pin's desk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly, then with greater confidence he rifles through it - papers and trinkets, meaningless.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches beneath the desk, knocking it gently with his knuckles. Quickly he removes the top drawer and reaches down into the desk frame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan draws out a stack of hundred dollar bills two inches thick. He pulls out another. Another. Another. Thumbing the stacks -- pure hundreds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Something creaks in the hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan freezes. Silently he replaces the money and drawer, his eyes on the doorway. He creeps towards the door on the balls of his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Still empty. Brendan creeps towards the stairs, passing other doorways, all open but for one. He stops for a moment, listening - silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STORAGE ROOM - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan enters the room - pitch black but for a small high window. Brendan pulls the curtains aside. A beam of sunlight spills just enough light to reveal a figure in the dark. Brendan jumps back, and his reflection in the large mirror jumps as well.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A white bird nesting in the window flutters into the dark room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan walks the large mirror into the beam of light, reflecting it around the room like a flashlight. More junk, a mattress, then a strangely bare corner with a single white lump in it. The white bird stands behind the lump, its dark eyes caught in the bare light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bird flies out the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan goes to the white lump, a small brick of white powder. White chalky residue patterns the floor -- there were other bricks there before.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind Brendan, in the mirror, something moves. Someone else, in the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tugger. He throws Brendan across the room, then heaves him into a wall.

Dode shakes the newspaper at him.

Dode throws the paper, which scatters in the wind.

	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDAN>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan's face is empty. Dode walks stiffly away. Brendan puts a hand on his shoulder, but shrinks back in a coughing spasm. Dode grabs Brendan's wrist and hits him in the face. Brendan hits the pavement.

EXT. HEAVEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bright clouds, sharp light. Emily flies towards us, glowing, then dimmer, her wings splutter out, the clouds turn gray, and we are looking at Emily's picture in the newspaper article.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BASKETBALL FIELD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan pulls the newspaper off his face, lying in a fetal position. Dode is nowhere to be seen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly, painfully, Brendan hoists himself up. He coughs and splutters, barely able to keep his footing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He limps across the field. Every step is agony. The wind blows against him. The black field seems impossibly long, still he keeps limping forward, towards the ravine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RUNOFF TUNNEL - DAY Brendan slides down the embankment, landing on his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gathered around the drain tunnel entrance are Tugger, the Pin, five of Tugger's flunkies and Dode in the middle. Everyone looks at Brendan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A long silence. Brendan clears his throat.

More silence.

	Yeah. He says he knows who did it. He says he knows where the body's at.

	You'll believe it, cause it's someone close to you. Real close.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DODE>
<DIRECTION>
The Pin looks up at Brendan, whose face is loose and nonchalant.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe it's hot, but it's Dode, you can't trust it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDAN>
<DODE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Real close.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DODE>
<DIRECTION>
Tugger's eyes are locked on Dode, his scar the color of raw liver. Brendan laughs and turns away.

</PIN>
<DODE>
<DIRECTION>
(with growing confidence)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not, cause that's not why she was killed, and it's real important to you, cause the person who killed her's real close, and cause he's got a lot to lose, and he knows if I don't bury him by spilling to you I spill to the bulls and bury him for real, and he's really really scared - she had a kid in her and he couldn't stand -
	</DIALOGUE>
</DODE>
<DIRECTION>
Tugger springs like a cat. He grabs Dode's hair and knees his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan stumbles towards them.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tug, it's alright!
	</DIALOGUE>

Tug has Dode on the ground, kicking his stomach and chest.

Tug backs off. Dode raises his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tug pulls the gun from his jacket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan yells, slips and falls into the shallow water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tug levels the gun at Dode's head and fires one shot. The back of Dode's skull comes off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rapport reverberates through the black tunnel behind them, and birds fly out. Dode remains upright for a moment, then falls limp into the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Pin's face is stupid, lifeless. Tug turns to him, gun in hand.
</DIRECTION>

</PIN>
<DIRECTION>
Tugger fires - dirt kicks up, and the Pin scrambles back. Brendan crawls towards Tug, yelling for him to stop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tug fires twice more, both misses, and the Pin is away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Distant sirens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan's vision blurs. He stumbles and falls into the shallow water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT

<DIRECTION>
FADE IN: A CEILING FAN

Spinning gently. Brendan's eyes open, watch it sleepily, then sharpen.

Brendan sits up in the bed. Tugger sits in a chair bedside, smoking. Brendan watches him for a long moment in the room's dim light.
</DIRECTION>
<TUGGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She sprung it on me, just. That's a hell of a thing to spring on a guy. I don't remember much. Laura talked me down after, said whatever, she knew her, said it wasn't true, but I still think sometimes. I think bout it being true. Bout it being mine. And maybe I did it cause I thought it was true. A hell of a thing.

</KARA>
<BRENDAN>

	You'd bury me at the same time, but it was mostly for the money. You got Dode thinking Em had his kid, thinking I did it, and that was enough for him, but he stuck to the money cause you had your claws in him, cause he couldn't come away from the deal without it and make you happy.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Still wish you knew what you wanted to know? If it's any consolation, it probably wasn't Dode's kid. It might have been Tug's, but frankly I wouldn't bet a horse - it was a crowded field there at the end.

	Well let's just, I mean why not just run away. Go somewhere. I've got a car.

<BRENDAN>

</BRENDAN>
<DIRECTION>
Her smoke drifts into the fan.
</DIRECTION>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wasn't serious, but we could go for awhile. Just until everything clears.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan watches the smoke. She stubs the butt out in an ash tray on the table and curls against his chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stretching his arm across the table, he nonchalantly spins the ash tray around with his finger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His glasses lay on the table. Through the left lens the cigarette is magnified. Pale blue arrow on the filter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Laura's arm stretches across his chest. He looks at it, then up at the fan, spinning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LATER

<DIRECTION>
Brendan slips out of bed. A glowing clock radio reads "3:16".

<DIRECTION>
INT. TUGGER'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

A swarm of silent activity. Tug's flunkies prepare various weapons. Brendan goes to Tug.

Brendan slides into the black mustang and gutters off into the night.

EXT. FRONT OF PIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan pulls the mustang into the driveway, limps up to the front door and knocks. One of the Pin's boys lets him in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Crowded with tense looking punks, half dressed like the Pin and half like Tugger. The Pin's mom is shuffling about, pouring them milk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Several more punks from both camps crowd the hall, and more lean in the darkened doorways. Brendan passes through quickly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PIN'S DEN - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Pin at his desk, flanked by two of his boys. Tug sits in the center of the room, two of his punks beside him. Brendan saunters between them and leans against the dresser.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Talk. PIN I want full assurance that any heat from Emily and Dode is gonna be on just you. I don't even want my name pulled in the shindig. Second, you owe me six Cs, no rush, but I want your shake that it'll come home in not too much time.

Tug's eyes burn, his scar reddens.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDAN>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's square. You did them after all. Lay low it'll blow over. Stick on this, one of you'll dish it to bury the other and you'll both get the rap. As to the six, did you borrow it?

</BRENDAN>
<TUGGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.

<BRENDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why would it be?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDAN>
<PIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why was the last one? Cause someone got greedy. Tug here's had the means to swipe half and cut it bad for a long time. Now we're splits my loss of trust's retroactive.

</BRENDAN>
<PIN>
	<DIALOGUE>

Tug shoots to his feet, kicking away his chair.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDAN>

	What would be good enough?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PIN>

Everyone in the room is on their feet. Brendan steps forward.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDAN>

All eyes to him, unbelieving.

</PIN>
<BRENDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Johnny, go with him.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They go.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tug just stares at Brendan, then tosses his hands up slightly and turns away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They all wait.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CRASH! from the next room. Everyone freezes. More breaking, then scuffling and shouting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two punks look at their bosses, then run out. Tug starts to follow, but Brendan holds him back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The noise through the wall grows tremendous, a full brawl. The ceiling pounds and shudders with footfalls and bodies hitting the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, from not too far away, a gunshot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Pin stands and goes towards the door, but Brendan shouts
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDAN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDAN>
<DIRECTION>
and slams it shut. A few tense seconds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another gunshot. Footfalls, then Tangles falls through the door, his chest red. The Pin bends over him.
</DIRECTION>
<TANGLES>
<DIRECTION>
(gasping)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The brick, it's gone. The brick's gone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TANGLES>
<DIRECTION>
Tangles stops gasping. The Pin stands, eyes blazing at Tug.
</DIRECTION>
<PIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Make peace, huh? Talk it out? Get your boys in my den soes you could snag it under my nose?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIN>
<DIRECTION>
Tug's scar is fiery red. He coils his body, snarling.
</DIRECTION>
<TUGGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TUGGER>
<BRENDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, that's not-
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDAN>
<PIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was it bad, Tug? Snag it so I don't know, or sell it off to flat the war odds?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIN>
<BRENDAN>
<DIRECTION>
(shouts)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pin, think about it-
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDAN>
<TUGGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright, I did all that!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Tug blows past Brendan like a train and slams the Pin into the ground with his fist. He punctuates his words with hard straight blows into the Pin's face.
</DIRECTION>
<TUGGER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I cut the brick, I stole the money, I faked a peace, I snagged your junk, I did it all!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TUGGER>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls the gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan shouts and throws himself on Tug's arm, wrenching it sideways. The gun clunks onto the carpet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Pin flips Tug over and for a moment Brendan is caught between them, hit and torn, rolling over the gun. Tug grabs it, Brendan grabs his wrist and the gun goes off, firing into the ceiling. Plaster sprays.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan screams, thrashing wildly, and manages to slip out of his bloodied jacket and out from between the two.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Pin is on top, pinning Tug's gun hand to the carpet, straining to keep it there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan leaps to his feet, staggers, then winds up and kicks Tug in the wrist with all his strength.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A terrible crunching popping sound. Tug roars. Brendan takes the gun from his limp hand.
</DIRECTION>
<PIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIN>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan backs off a few steps. The Pin strains to keep Tug down.
</DIRECTION>
<PIN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do him now!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIN>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan stumbles back. Tug roars, flips the Pin over and beats his face mercilessly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan stumbles out into the hall. INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Empty. From the darkened doorways and the thin ceiling relentless sounds of fighting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan walks backwards as if in a trance, eyes glued to the Pin's door. Inside wild shadows splay across the walls, and the Pin shouts Brendan's name. Light flashes from another darkened doorway and the wall beside Brendan splinters. Brendan spins on his heel and fires three shots into the darkness, which falls silent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns the gun back on the Pin's doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a spray of sparks the doorway turns dark. They broke the lamp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dark doorway looms up before Brendan, inky black. Horrible sounds come from it, blows, breaking bone, screams. The Pin screams Brendan's name over and over, calling for help. Pleading. Brendan steps back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Time slows down. Brendan drops the gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It thunks on the carpet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In one motion Brendan kicks the gun down the hall into the Pin's doorway, turns and runs into the room where he found the brick.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STORAGE ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dark. Brendan runs through, clawing past dark fighting shapes, running like a man possessed. He breaks through the darkness and heaves himself up through the small window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FRONT OF PIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan scrambles out, slips on the grass and hits the ground hard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two sharp gunshots come from the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everything is suddenly still. Brendan stands slowly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He notices a light from the Mustang - the trunk has drifted open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside, a pale blue arm lies tangled in black plastic. Blue fingernails. Cheap plastic bracelets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan shuts the trunk solidly, then walks off down the street and vanishes into the inky night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A moment later police cars pull up, sirens blaring, lights turning the dark streets bright as day.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE IN:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SCHOOL PAYPHONE - EARLY MORNING

<THE_BRAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan hangs up, then pauses, lost in thought.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SIDE OF GYM - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan sits against the massive gym building, writing on a piece of looseleaf paper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ADMINISTRATION BUILDING - LATER Brendan slips the paper under a door stenciled "VP Offices".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BASKETBALL FIELD - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cold, barren. Wind whistles softly and jangles the metal mesh basketball nets like windchimes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan stands crookedly, hands in pockets, eyes trained on the cold black horizon. A speck appears. Brendan waits for it, bracing himself against the wind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Laura. She puts her arms around him, a warm embrace. Brendan draws back.
</DIRECTION>
<LAURA>

Laura looks at him strangely, a little uneasy.
</DIRECTION>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The papers say six dead, three around the house, one girl in the trunk of Tug's car, and the Pin and Tug.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan's face is frozen in an ambiguous frown.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah? LAURA Tug tried to shoot his way out when the police got there. They tied him to Dode, too. Same gun. And the girl.

Laura pulls back more.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDAN>

<DIRECTION>
(bewildered)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell it to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<BRENDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright, from the top. You had your fingers in Brad Bramish for appearances and to keep him buying from the Pin, who you were hooked with. Emily came to you and Brad, you saw her for what she was, an insecure little girl trying to get in. She goes on the backburner. Meanwhile maybe you're getting bored, maybe just greedy, so when the Pin scores big with the bricks you take your shot. You hook one, take half, and cut it back to size, but you cut it bad. Maybe accidentally, maybe to down the Pin's operation, doesn't matter. You put it back, but poor Frisco doses off it and lands in a coma.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(voice strengthening)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So now the Pin's fuming, maybe he's jealous of Brad, so he comes to Brad's crowd looking for blood, or at least a scape. You know trouble. There's going to be a war over this. And there's Emily. She trusts you. She wants in. It's duck soup.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDAN>
<LAURA>
<DIRECTION>
(murmurs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<BRENDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You frame her for the bad brick, then you cut her loose. You turn on your heel and bite her in the throat. Last week on the payphone, Pico and Alexander, she saw something she was scared of. Tug's car driving by, the Pin driving, but she wouldn't have seen the Pin. No, she was across the street, angel. She saw the passenger side. She saw you. She saw you and ran like she saw some devil.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDAN>
<DIRECTION>
Laura's face is very still, quivering.
</DIRECTION>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Brendan, why are you-
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<BRENDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And she took the hit. Dode hid her away, but the Pin was on to her, tracked her down, told her to meet him, that they would make good. Gave her a time, and a place. And sent Tug. Just to get the straight. But maybe you had talked Tug up, or maybe he just blew a fuse, but Em sprung it on him that she had her kid, and he did what anyone could count on Tug doing - he hit her. She took the hit for you. You let her take it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDAN>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<BRENDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<DIRECTION>
She sobs through a tensed, straight face. Brendan holds her stare, but his eyes are distant.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope it isn't. I want you to have been on my side all along, not just trying to get me under your thumb like Brad and the Pin and Tug.

	<DIALOGUE>
	But I think you knew that meeting was going to blow up. I think that was your final play. But I hope I'm wrong. I hope everything I wrote in the note I dropped at Gary Trueman's office this morning is wrong. About your and Brad's involvement in the Pin's runnings. I hope you didn't steal the brick last night. In your purse.

</BRENDAN>
<LAURA>
<DIRECTION>
(breathes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<BRENDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's good. That means you didn't let me walk into a slaughterhouse. You didn't lead Tug and the Pin and their crews to the slaughter. And when Trueman reads the note, takes my cue and searches your locker, he won't find a damn thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDAN>
<DIRECTION>
Something changes in Laura's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LOCKER CAGE - INSERT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trueman and several other men force Laura's locker open. From its dark interior the chalky white brick falls out, spins through the air, and shatters silently on the locker cage floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BASKETBALL FIELD - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A moment of silence between them. The basketball nets jangle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Laura steps back. She looks as if she has been punched in the face.
</DIRECTION>
<LAURA>
<DIRECTION>
(murmurs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Brendan... don't...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<BRENDAN>
<DIRECTION>
(gently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's done.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDAN>
<DIRECTION>
Her face does strange things, subtle contortions. She watches his eyes. He doesn't look at her. Her voice shakes.
</DIRECTION>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Done. Well. That's most of it. 9 out of 10. I told Em to tell Tug it was his. Told her it would soften him up. She said she wished she could keep it, but she didn't love the father. I was going to drive her down the next day, we'd found a doctor. Most wouldn't. She was starting to show. 3 months. You know whose kid that makes it, or have you known all along?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly, steadily, she straightens up. Her figure takes back some dignity. She steps towards him deliberately. Closer. Right up against him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She brings her head to his, puts her lips to his ear, breathes warm breath, and says two words. The first is
</DIRECTION>
<LAURA>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mother-
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<DIRECTION>
the second is low, guttural and lost to the whistling wind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns and walks briskly away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan watches her go across the dark, barren field of asphalt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Metal jangles. Brendan turns to see the Brain hopping a chain link fence. Brendan turns his eyes back on Laura.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You get your straight?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDAN>
<THE_BRAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. I wouldn't have-
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_BRAIN>
<BRENDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	S'alright.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDAN>
<THE_BRAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, well. Chuck Burns came to. The knife guy. Spilled it all to the bulls, guess Brad Bramish hired him. On his own, just a grudge thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_BRAIN>
<BRENDAN>
<DIRECTION>
(nods slightly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fits. You did good, Brain. Go sleep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDAN>
<THE_BRAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, you too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_BRAIN>
<DIRECTION>
The Brain starts to walk away, but turns back.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_BRAIN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What'd she whisper to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_BRAIN>
<BRENDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She called me a dirty word.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDAN>
<THE_BRAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright, you don't have to tell me. Thick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_BRAIN>
<BRENDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As what-all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDAN>
<DIRECTION>
Brendan stands alone on the asphalt field, watching Laura until she reaches the end of the field and walks off behind a twisted chain linked fence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The first period bell rings, and Brendan walks back towards campus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT.
</DIRECTION>
