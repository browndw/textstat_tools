INT. SECOND CLASS CARRIAGE. COUNTRY SIDE. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leo Tolstoy (80), sits writing on his lapboard. He is quite simply the greatest living writer in the world. His devotion to pacifism, his rejection of the trappings of Orthodoxy in favor of a simple Christian lifestyle convince many to regard him as a living saint. With him are his much younger wife, the COUNTESS SOFYA, favorite daughter SASHA, and his personal physician DUSHAN MAKOVITSKY. Sasha and Dushan write in their diaries. Sofya looks from one to the next a little impatient. The train begins to slow.

	But if they block the track, the train can't go...YOU HAVE TO MAKE THEM MOVE.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFYA>
<DIRECTION>
The conductor shrugs, walks away. She goes to the window to investigate. A crowd of a hundred peasants, students surround the engine, block the track. They carry a huge cloth banner honoring Tolstoy. We can hear voices chanting "Tolstoy. Tolstoy. Tolstoy", voices crying "You are the truth." "You are the hope of the Russian people."
</DIRECTION>
<SOFYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, they won't move. We are gonna die here. Leo, Leo, go and say something to them. It's the only way we are gonna get out of here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFYA>
<DIRECTION>
The chanting grows in intensity. Tolstoy gets to his feet, walks to the window, shows himself to the crowd. A great shout goes up. Tolstoy lifts his hand for silence. Gradually, it comes.
</DIRECTION>
<TOLSTOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have seen your banner. And I´ve heard what you say. You think I´m the hope of Russia, do you? Well, that´s not true. You are the hope of Russia. The hope of all the world. You say, you want a new way to live? Well, you are not gonna find it making a fuss over me. So, I suggest that you get on with your work and let a poor old men get on with his.

The cries begin. "Clear the tracks. Let them pass. Let them go." Tolstoy closes the door and waves to the crowd as the train pulls away.

On the chanting crowd now as the train pulls away. We focus on a handsome young man, a little stiff maybe, a little intellectual. This is VALENTIN FEDOROVITCH BULGAKOV. He can't contain his enthusiasm. Over the noise of the train.

INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. SOFYA'S BEDROOM. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A handsome room, walls covered with generations of family photographs. Religious icons are given pride of place, a testament, not to piety, but to an ingrained social conservatism, a certain position in the world.

Countess Sofya mumbles her morning prayers before a make shift altar. Wiping away tears, she leaves the room.
</DIRECTION>

Sofya walks down the stairs and through the entry passed an old servant asleep in a chair. She continues to the basement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. TOLSTOY'S BEDROOM/STUDY. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tolstoy has moved himself out of the refined upper floors into a simple vaulted room he uses as both bedroom and study. The walls are bare except for a portrait of his daughter. The furniture is simple, some of it hand made: a small bed against the wall, a little writing desk in one corner stacked with books, littered with papers, more mail, opened and unopened. Pairs of rude homemade shoes line a work bench.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tolstoy sleeps in his bed. Though it's late March and still cold, the window is open. Sofya closes it. She stands very still, watching Tolstoy sleep. Sitting on the bed, she gently touches his hand, whispers.
</DIRECTION>
<SOFYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Darling.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFYA>
<DIRECTION>
She lies next to him, something girlish, hopeful in her face, as if waiting for him to wake up and adore her, but he sleeps on. She carefully takes his arm, positions it under her neck, and rolling toward him, wraps it around her. The image of love's intimacy, of wedded bliss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His hand slips off her shoulder, once, twice. She moves awkwardly to replace it. He moves a little toward her. She kisses his neck, his cheek. We don't know if he's awake, but even this shadow of intimacy penetrates her soul.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOSCOW. STUDY. DAY.

<DIRECTION>
A handsome study in the Moscow townhouse of VLADIMIR GRIGOREVICH CHERTKOV, Tolstoy's most articulate and dedicated disciple. He's interviewing Tolstoy's newly appointed secretary, VALENTIN BULGAKOV, the young man we met near the train, who, at the mention of sex, blushes a little.
</DIRECTION>
<CHERTKOV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But sex... You are twenty three. Not an easy age for abstinence, is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHERTKOV>
<VALENTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tolstoy does not approve of sexual relations. I know this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTIN>
<CHERTKOV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He despises them, in fact...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHERTKOV>
<DIRECTION>
Chertkov reaches for a small tin of moustache wax.
</DIRECTION>
<CHERTKOV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want to belabor the point, but I arranged for a manservant last year who proceeded to ruin two housemaids just like that. He was very upset.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHERTKOV>
<VALENTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This would not be a problem. I'm celibate. I'm also a strict vegetarian.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Chertkov nods his approval, begins to worry his moustache.
</DIRECTION>
<CHERTKOV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I've heard many good things about you. I've even read what you`ve written. So has he.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHERTKOV>
<DIRECTION>
Valentin's face flushes with pride. Chertkov steals a glance at his reflection in the glass bookcase. One side of his moustache droops a little. He tugs awkwardly at it.
</DIRECTION>
<CHERTKOV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My dear boy, if you were to become Tolstoy's private secretary, you would be given a great gift. You'll be with him every day, eat together, walk in the forest by his side.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHERTKOV>
<DIRECTION>
It's difficult to contain himself.
</DIRECTION>
<VALENTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Believe me, since becoming a Tolstoyan, I have become so eager to learn, so comitted to discussing ideas, improving my very soul.
	</DIALOGUE>

<CHERTKOV>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, we have a lot to do if we are to get his work to the people.

	<DIALOGUE>
	We?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTIN>
<DIRECTION>
They both laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<CHERTKOV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, we. If we can encourage the spread of passive resistance...just think of it Valentin thousands of ordinary Russians casting off centuries of spiritual and political oppression-

	<DIALOGUE>
	In the name of truth and freedom.

Chertkov walks to the window, signals Valentin to follow him. He points to

<DIRECTION>
TWO MEN IN PLAINCLOTHES standing in the street below.
</DIRECTION>
<CHERTKOV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Czar's police...You'll be followed when you leave here...and the church will stop at nothing to bring him back into the fold. His children can't be trusted... only Sasha... and then of course there is the Countess...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, one doesn't like to come between married people whatever the circumstances, but her dogged attachment to private property, her public criticism of our movement... The point is, he needs a man of your intellectual gifts around him. Someone who can help him with the new work. Someone who understands his goals.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHERTKOV>
<DIRECTION>
Chertkov returns to the desk.
</DIRECTION>
<CHERTKOV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And although they've allowed me to return to Russia, I can't see him. They keep me under house arrest... They might as well keep me in a cage.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHERTKOV>
<DIRECTION>
Clearly upset, Chertkov pauses to get control of himself. He picks up a package, hands it to Valentin.
</DIRECTION>
<CHERTKOV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, I need you to put these letters directly into his hands. One can't be sure what gets through to him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHERTKOV>

Valentin looks at him, quizzical.

</VALENTIN>
<MASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's your first day. Enjoy it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASHA>
<DIRECTION>
She sits on the bed. He's a little taken aback, not used to this degree of familiarity. It makes no impression on Masha.
</DIRECTION>
<MASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You met Sergeyenko?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASHA>
<VALENTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Last night.

</VALENTIN>
<MASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ad what do you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASHA>
<VALENTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He seems very sincere.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Masha hands him his tea.
</DIRECTION>
<VALENTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you. Why are you laughing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTIN>
<MASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say that again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASHA>
<VALENTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said he seems very... Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTIN>
<MASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that what you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASHA>
<VALENTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just arrived...What's your name?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTIN>
<MASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Masha. But you should still say what you think. Not just about him. We all should.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASHA>
<VALENTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you for the tea.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Their eyes meet, hold. Valentin's discomfort increases.
</DIRECTION>
<MASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tomorrow you can make your own.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASHA>
<DIRECTION>
She walks to the door, turns to see him still watching her.
</DIRECTION>
<MASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's a sorry old tight-assed stick in the mud...but yes, he's sincere.
	</DIALOGUE>

EXT. ROAD TO YASNAYA POLYANA. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A modest horse drawn cart. Valentin sits beside the driver, contemplates the birch trees that line the road, the long shadows they cast. Above, crows make lazy circles in the sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. ENTRY WAY/STAIRS. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Valentin stands in the entry way, waiting. He looks lost.
</DIRECTION>
<VALENTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello...hello...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTIN>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're the new secretary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up to see Sasha examining him from the landing above.
</DIRECTION>
<SASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Papa's out. You can wait in the library. Ivan will show you up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SASHA>
<DIRECTION>
She disappears. He hears a door close. He notices a surly house servant, IVAN, who, inexplicably, leads a goat through the house. He points upstairs and walks away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. LIBRARY. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alone now among Tolstoy's books, Valentin makes his way slowly to a writing table, the holy of holies, on which War and Peace and Anna Karenina were written. He runs his hand along the old wood top. Emboldened by a backward glance, he sits in Tolstoy's chair. Before him are stacks of letters, pens and pencils, a pot of India ink. There's a notebook lying open. He leans forward to read it. A noise in the hall stops him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tolstoy enters from the dining room, red cheeked, beard dripping wet, the energy of a man ten years younger than he is. Valentin stands.
</DIRECTION>
<TOLSTOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm glad you're here. So glad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOLSTOY>
<DIRECTION>
He tromps across the room, kisses the boy enthusiastically on both cheeks. Valentin is overcome by the great man's warmth.
</DIRECTION>
<VALENTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm... I'm... Here is-
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Valentin interrupts himself with a sneeze.
</DIRECTION>
<TOLSTOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God bless you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOLSTOY>
<VALENTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. Sometimes I...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Valentin pulls out a letter of introduction. Tolstoy takes it out and puts it down without a glance.
</DIRECTION>
<TOLSTOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vladimir Grigorevich has already written about you at length. I need your help badly. The manifesto against the government is hard work. They commit their idiotic abuses faster than I can catalogue them...and the new book...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOLSTOY>
<VALENTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He told me about it...It's very exciting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Tolstoy nods.
</DIRECTION>
<TOLSTOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've become convinced that all the world's religions have a single organizing principle. Can you guess what it is? Love! Love! Simple... Now, I want to talk about you. How are you? How was your journey? Come, sit down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOLSTOY>
<DIRECTION>
Tolstoy sits on the old sofa. Valentin follows suit.
</DIRECTION>
<TOLSTOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, I was born on this sofa...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOLSTOY>
<DIRECTION>
Valentin gets right back up. Tolstoy laughs, pats the sofa.
</DIRECTION>
<TOLSTOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sit. Sit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOLSTOY>
<DIRECTION>
Valentin sits down.
</DIRECTION>
<TOLSTOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Myself, my brother, my children, at least five or six of them, right here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, I've read your essays. How`s your work progressing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOLSTOY>
<DIRECTION>
Valentin looks into the great man's kind old face. He tries to speak but he's overcome with emotion and begins to weep.
</DIRECTION>
<TOLSTOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My boy, what is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I upset you in some way. Was it the sofa? It's only a sofa.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOLSTOY>
<DIRECTION>
Valentin shakes his head, smiling through his tears.
</DIRECTION>
<VALENTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm very happy. You are very kind. I'm no one and you are... you are Leo Tolstoy and you ask me about my work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Tolstoy takes Valentin's hand, sits him back on sofa.
</DIRECTION>
<TOLSTOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You rest for a moment and I'll fetch you a glass of tea. Rest, because there's work for both of us together.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOLSTOY>
<DIRECTION>
He smiles and goes, leaving Valentin to contemplate his fortune.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. YASNAYA POLYANA. GROUNDS. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sofya, Sasha, Valentin, ANDREY, Tolstoy's son, and Tolstoy all clustered around a table taking tea. Dushan stands near the group fiddling with a gramophone that sits on a small table.
</DIRECTION>
<SOFYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These people have nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFYA>
<DUSHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It really is the most extraordinary thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUSHAN>
<DIRECTION>
Absolutely ignoring him.
</DIRECTION>
<SOFYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not for lack of land that the muzhiks live in poverty. They have no will power and they drink too much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFYA>
<TOLSTOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not suggesting they be given land. Private property is the root of the problem... We should be giving ours away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOLSTOY>
<ANDREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give it to whom?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDREY>
<SOFYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all ridiculous. You think that poverty makes the peasants somehow morally superior.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFYA>
<TOLSTOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I believe that wealth corrupts us all, yes I do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOLSTOY>
<DIRECTION>
A pause. Valentin fills the silence.
</DIRECTION>
<VALENTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a keystone of the movement.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTIN>
<SOFYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I know all about the movement.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFYA>
<DIRECTION>
A pause. Valentin notices that people from the front lawn have moved up to watch all this. Life in the fishbowl, the Tolstoys seem neither to notice nor care.
</DIRECTION>
<TOLSTOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If the peasants had money, they wouldn't surround themselves, as we do, with footmen costing ten rubles a month.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOLSTOY>
<SOFYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, they'd spend it on drink and whores.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFYA>
<TOLSTOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Valentin Fedorovich, do you think fifty years from now, people will eat while grown men walk around and wait on them hand and foot?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOLSTOY>
<DIRECTION>
Valentin doesn't know what to say. A giggle from Dushan.
</DIRECTION>
<DUSHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, that's good...that's good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUSHAN>
<DIRECTION>
Dushan, having sat at table, tries surreptitiously to get down Tolstoy's words in the diary he holds below the table. Sofya flushes with anger.
</DIRECTION>
<VALENTIN>
<DIRECTION>
I think...(sneeze)
</DIRECTION>
<SOFYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop scribbling!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(points to her husband)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You all think he's Christ, don't you? He thinks he's Christ.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFYA>
<DIRECTION>
There is an awkward pause.
</DIRECTION>
<DUSHAN>
<DIRECTION>
(flustered)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not...I don't believe Leo Nikolayevich is Christ. Christ is Christ but...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUSHAN>
<SOFYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFYA>
<DUSHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I believe he's one of the prophets. God speaks through him. I recognize the cadence in his voice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUSHAN>
<SOFYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is unbearable. No wonder I feel lonely. I'm surrounded by morrons.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFYA>
<SASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mama, you're being ridiculous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SASHA>
<SOFYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Am I? I sit here and listen to this talk of love and God and equality, knowing full well that Count Generosity here is fully prepared to give away everything we have.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFYA>
<TOLSTOY>
<DIRECTION>
(exhausted)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You keep going on like that...Why do you think we should profit from the work I´m doing which is only meant for the sake of the people.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOLSTOY>
<DIRECTION>
She turns to see Dushan scribbling again.
</DIRECTION>
<SOFYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	STOP IT! STOP WRITING NOW!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFYA>
<DIRECTION>
Valentin glances at Sasha, uncomfortable at these outbursts. A long pause. Dushan tries to relieve the tension.
</DIRECTION>
<DUSHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In defense of my gift, let me demonstrate. It's quite remarkable, really.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUSHAN>
<DIRECTION>
He gets up, places a record on the gramophone, needle on the record. What comes forth is not music, but Tolstoy's voice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a recording of a recent speech against capital punishment. His voice booms, tinny and distorted. Dushan walks to the machine, stares at it in awe. Valentin is completely caught up in the technology.
</DIRECTION>
<VALENTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's your voice. It's wonderful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTIN>
<DIRECTION>
They all listen for a moment, look to Tolstoy for a response.
</DIRECTION>
<TOLSTOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's tiresome. Another remarkable invention will supercede it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOLSTOY>
<DIRECTION>
Valentin blushes and looks at the table. Dushan tries to hide his disappointment.
</DIRECTION>
<TOLSTOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please excuse me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOLSTOY>
<DIRECTION>
Tolstoy rises, leaves the table, walks out onto the lawn. Dushan gets up quickly, bumping the table as he goes. Tea spills. Valentin moves to wipe it up, sneezes, a barrage of irritable blessings.
</DIRECTION>
<DUSHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leo Nikolayevich is something of a Luddite, I fear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUSHAN>
<DIRECTION>
Sofya crosses to the machine, removes the record from the gramophone, replaces it with another Dushan has brought.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the air is filled with the final duet from Mozart's Il Nozze di Figaro. She returns to her place. There is a long moment where all take in the sublimity of it. Tolstoy walks slowly back to the table. He stands completely still. Tears fill his eyes and roll down his cheeks.
</DIRECTION>
<TOLSTOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, that´s better. That´s nice. Very nice indeed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOLSTOY>
<DIRECTION>
Sofya crosses to her husband, wipes the tears off his face. Valentin watches as they embrace.
</DIRECTION>
<VALENTIN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Do your parents often speak to each other so...bluntly?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTIN>
<DIRECTION>
INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. LIBRARY. EVENING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across from Tolstoy's writing desk is Sasha's world, a makeshift office lined with more bookcases where she does her work, sending cables, editing manuscripts, answering endless stacks of mail. Valentin sits near her, learning the ropes.
</DIRECTION>
<SASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My mother doesn't understand my father's goals, not since his work as a novelist became secondary. His commitment to the spiritual life offends her. They've fought about it for years.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SASHA>
<VALENTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sure she means well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Sasha just looks at him.
</DIRECTION>
<VALENTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your father is the greatest writer in the world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTIN>
<SASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quite.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SASHA>
<DIRECTION>
A pause.
</DIRECTION>
<VALENTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean to say, I feel privileged to be here. It's an... honor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Valentin feels himself slip further into mundanity. Sasha goes back to her letter. Valentin SNEEZES.
</DIRECTION>
<SASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God Bless You.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SASHA>
<DIRECTION>
They read together for a moment. He sneezes again.
</DIRECTION>
<SASHA>
<DIRECTION>
(irritated)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God bless you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SASHA>
<VALENTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. Sometimes I sneeze when I'm nervous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTIN>
<DIRECTION>
She regards him like an animal in the zoo. Ivan appears at the door.
</DIRECTION>
<SASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SASHA>
<IVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It´s a note, for him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IVAN>
<DIRECTION>
He nods toward Valentin.
</DIRECTION>
<SASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, give it to him then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SASHA>
<DIRECTION>
Valentin reads the note.
</DIRECTION>
<VALENTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It´s from your mother. She wants to see me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTIN>
<DIRECTION>
As Valentin goes,
</DIRECTION>
<SASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She is looking for allies. Pay attention. This is war.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SASHA>
<DIRECTION>
INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. SITTING ROOM. NIGHT.

<DIRECTION>
Sofya is settled on a divan in a small room off the dining room. Valentin sits beside her holding a glass of tea.
</DIRECTION>
<SOFYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see a fine young man before me. Clear eyes. Nice features, rather handsome in a peculiar way.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Countess...

	Many young men ruin their looks by loose living. You're a real Tolstoyan, I can tell!

	I admire your husband immensely.

	That's excellent. He likes that.

</SOFYA>
<VALENTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His ideas are beautiful...social justice...the idea...Don't you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Sofya drains her tea cup, signals for more.
</DIRECTION>
<SOFYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's very grateful for the help you've been giving him. He told me so himself. I think it surprises him that a young man would be so diligent. When he was your age, he was whoring in the Caucasus.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFYA>
<DIRECTION>
Valentin's eyes are wide. She nods.
</DIRECTION>
<SOFYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He wrote it all down. He even gave me a copy, so I could read all the details...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFYA>
<VALENTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTIN>

</VALENTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Sofya smiles at his honesty.
</DIRECTION>
<SOFYA>

	When he was writing it, long before Chertkov created that monstrosity at Telyatinki, before all this "new religion" and revolutionary nonsense...

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you think of Chertkov, by the way?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFYA>
<VALENTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's given me an extraordinary opportunity.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTIN>
<SOFYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you see what a fool he is, a self-serving puritanical idiot. I have to say, it's been extremely pleasant since they've locked him in his house.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFYA>
<DIRECTION>
Sofya smiles. Valentin is nonplussed by her directness.
</DIRECTION>
<SOFYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When my husband was writing it, in the mid-sixties, he'd bring me pages to re-copy everyday. I was the only one who could read his handwriting. I could read his intentions, too. Afternoons, we'd drink tea and discuss changes. "Natasha wouldn't say that to Prince Andrey," or "Pierre's too simple here. He's not stupid."
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFYA>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles at the memory.
</DIRECTION>
<SOFYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I don't count anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFYA>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. She sips her tea. She glances out the door to see Sasha hovering nearby. Listening? Sasha walks away.
</DIRECTION>
<SOFYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must help me, Valentin Fedorovich. I want only what is best for my husband and my family. I could tolerate the situation if it only concerned me What I can not do is sit back while they steal my children's inheritance. Do you know I was the only person. I could understand his intention.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFYA>
<VALENTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't believe anyone wants to do that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Sofya gives him a condescending smile. She produces a package from the table beside her, hands it to him.
</DIRECTION>
<SOFYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have a little gift for you
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFYA>
<DIRECTION>
He opens it, extracts a small leather bound book. He stares at it.

	It's a diary.

	What. You. See.

Valentin fingers the package, stifles a sneeze.

	<DIALOGUE>
	More tea?

<DIRECTION>
EXT. TELYATINKI COMPOUND. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Valentin rides into the compound. A number of the disciples are outside working. There is the ringing of metal on wood. He looks for the source. As the way clears a little, he sees Masha chopping away with an axe. He stops his horse to watch her.
</DIRECTION>
<MASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're finished for the day?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASHA>
<VALENTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He didn't need me this afternoon.

</VALENTIN>
<DIRECTION>
He gets down off his horse. Masha continues to chop. He picks up an axe, holds it awkwardly.
</DIRECTION>

	No, I find it sweet. I find you reactionary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASHA>
<DIRECTION>
She laughs. Valentin picks up a log, sets it on end and begins to chop. He doesn't do it well. Masha smiles at his struggle.
</DIRECTION>
<MASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He admires you, I believe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASHA>
<DIRECTION>
What's she saying?
</DIRECTION>
<MASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sergeyenko told me. He's miserable about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASHA>
<VALENTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tolstoy's kind to everyone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTIN>
<DIRECTION>
The log is stuck to the blade of his axe. He's really struggling now.
</DIRECTION>
<MASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you talk about when you're with him?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

<VALENTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We talk about me.

</VALENTIN>
<MASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really.

</MASHA>
<VALENTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He wants to know everything about me, my parents, my relations with women, my experience of god -

</VALENTIN>

He looks up to see Masha smiling at him.
</DIRECTION>
<MASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what relations are these?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASHA>
<DIRECTION>
Valentin blushes, goes back to trying to chopping. Almost immediately the log becomes stuck to the blade of the axe. He bangs it, bangs it trying to free it. He glances up to see her still looking at him. He pounds again and again.

A sly smile on her lips, the tension gone from her face, she seems twenty years younger.

<TOLSTOY>

	Sofya, are you ill?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOLSTOY>

She rolls toward him making it clear she's quite naked under the sheets. This is no sick bed.

He takes a step toward her, then stops.
</DIRECTION>
<TOLSTOY>

Sofya laughs.

	Let me make you crow.

</SOFYA>
<DIRECTION>
A pause, then a huge laugh comes up from the very center of him. He twists his neck, thrusts his head upward, crows like a rooster.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He virtually runs to her, embraces her, kisses her. She is a giddy girl in his arms. He breaks the embrace and begins strutting around the room.
</DIRECTION>
<SOFYA>

<VALENTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You make it sound very simple.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTIN>
<MASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is simple. What we did is what men and women do, have done, will continue doing. What could be more simple? We touched each other-- stayed close together. Something passed between us. Something real. That is a betrayal of what? Of nothing. But you're afraid... All your ideas. What are you afraid of?

</DIRECTION>
<SOFYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Laughing about the fact that you've developed a senile crush on a fat middle aged flatterer. Your passion for Chertkov has become a standing joke.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I have a great affection for Vladimir Grigorivich. Let them laugh if they find it amusing.

	But it's not amusing, darling. It's sick. It's not normal. You hang on his every word.

	We have a great deal in common.

	You have nothing in common. You are a genius. He's a sycophant and a pervert.

Chertkov drives the point home.

Tolstoy turns to Sofya.

	You can´t leave Tolstoy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTIN>
<MASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am not. Look, when I read his Confession, it moved me, Valya. He was searching for freedom. Freedom from anger. Freedom from attachment. Freedom from all the superstition and nonsense of the church. It moved me so much. I thought that's what it would be about. Isn't that what it's about? Freedom and love? But they mix it all up.

Valentin fetches it from his satchel.

	" Your youth and your desire for happiness reminds me cruelly of my age and the impossibility of happiness for me." When I was courting Sofya, she was so young and pure, it seemed impossible that I'd ever have her. I didn't want to tell her how I felt and I wanted to tell her nothing else. So I wrote down a string of letters and asked her if she could decipher them. She looked completely confused, thinking it was a game or...

Tolstoy looks into the middle distance, remembering his love.

<DIRECTION>
Tolstoy looks at Valentin as if the boy might offer some explanation of the miraculous.

	Yes... The love he tells us to practice, the love of the Gospels. Why do I have to explain this? Perfect love. Eternal love. The love that binds mankind together.

The circus sleeps. Valentin sits on a bench outside the station master's house. The tents erected by the press glow like lanterns in the field.

Some people lie on the hard platform. He looks across the tracks at Sofya's private car. A single light burns in the window

Valentin sees Chertkov standing near the bed. Dushan returns to the chair next to Tolstoy. His cheeks are damp, his breathing irregular.

INT. ASTAPOVO. STATIONMASTER'S HOUSE. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She steps into the room. For a moment, she seems overwhelmed at the sight of him. She looks at Valentin, who nods at her as if to say go on. Sofya walks past Chertkov without acknowledging him. Dushan lets go his hold of Tolstoy's wrist and gets out of the chair, out of her way. She approaches her sleeping, husband, the love of her life, her cross, her everything.
</DIRECTION>
<SOFYA>

	Lyovochka!

Sofya looks around and sits back. Strangely, she does control herself. She becomes very still. She takes her husband's hand, begins quietly to speak to him.
</DIRECTION>
<SOFYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't speak, but I hear you.

She sits very still holding her husband's hand. Then, it seems she feels the slightest of movements, the slightest squeeze of her hand. She looks down to see Tolstoy open his eyes. He looks at her for a moment, the hint of a smile, then closes his eyes again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Valentin sees it, glances at Sasha. Then, he begins to fight for breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DUSHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First cessation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUSHAN>
<DIRECTION>
A general sense of panic at the proximity of death. Tolstoy fights for a last breath.

	Second cessation.

Sofya whispers quietly to her dying husband.

Tolstoy continues to struggle, then silence, silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sasha starts to sob. Sofya reaches out to her daughter. Sasha comes to her mother who holds her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She feels someone next to her. She looks up. It's Chertkov.
</DIRECTION>
<CHERTKOV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am sorry, Sofya Andreyevna.

The most unlikely thing, she pats his hand.

A sizeable crowd has assembled, the usual reporters, photographers, cinematographers, but students, too, and soldiers, factory workers, housewives.

Dushan faces the crowd. Quiet. Quiet.

	At ten minutes after six in the morning, a great soul passed from our world. Leo Nikoleyevich Tolstoy is dead.

As Dushan finishes his tribute, a single voice begins to sing the old Russian hymn, Eternal Memory. Gradually, more and more of the crowd picks it up. Valentin begins to sing. His eyes run over the crowd of mourners. Then, something stops the flow of his gaze. His eyes fill with tears.

A black draped funeral train waits in the station. Many mourners are congregated on the platform. Chertkov comes out of the little house, followed by Andrey, Valentin and Dushan carrying Tolstoy's coffin to the train.

Sofya appears with Sasha, who escorts her through the crowd. The Orthodox priest approaches .

	As a daughter of the church, I'm sure you wouldn't object to my saying a few words at the funeral.

Sofya looks out the window, sees the people lined up along the rail, mourn her loss. As she looks away, we see the people reflected in the glass, some of them kneel, some of them remove their hats.

Valentin watches the train pull away. He holds Masha to him.

As the train moves slowly through the corridor of mourners, some of them fall in and walk behind it. The camera travels up and up as the train travels north taking Sofya and her husband back to Yasnaya Polyana.
