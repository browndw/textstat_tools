We are at the actual location now, not looking at TV. We see the ship surrounded by soldiers, two medium tanks, two artillery pieces, and a couple of machine guns. Some distance away is a suggestion of the crowd of civilians, held back by police. Prominent in the scene are newsreel and television cameras. OUR CAMERA MOVES IN to MED. SHOT. As it does so, we see a couple of metal objects rising slowly from the top of the ship. One, which is an oddly-designed coil of wire, slides up and revolves slowly. The other is a section of vented pipe with a convex cap on it.

MED. SHOT - THE SHIP

After a long, tense moment, a ramp appears silently out of the side of the ship and slides down to the ground. There is an audible gasp as a man appears at the top of the ramp. He looks around at the crowd with cool and imperturbable dignity. This is KLAATU. He is completely human in appearance. The only unearthly thing about him is his clothing. He wears a tunic that is very good looking, but at the same time thoroughly comfortable and practical. On his head is a metal helmet that obscures most of his face. (It would be impossible to identify him later.) The design of this helmet gives the impression that it is more a formal headdress than for protection. Klaatu is above all an impressive man -- a man of tremendous dignity and presence. He has the tolerant superiority that comes with absolute knowledge.

shooting from the side, showing Klaatu advancing slowly toward the line of soldiers. He holds out the mysterious object in front of him in a gesture that is actually one of offering but could be misinterpreted as menacing.

MED. SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Klaatu falls to the ground wounded. The object he was holding has dropped from his hand and smashed. The soldiers start to gather around Klaatu excitedly when suddenly there appears in the entrance to the space ship a huge robot. There is a gasp of amazement from the crowd and the solders draw back at sight of him. The robot is ten feet tall, is made in the almost-perfect image of a man. He is to be played by an actor and his flesh appears to be made of a greenish metal. His eyes flash as though lighted internally. His perfectly- fashioned, muscular body is covered only with a loincloth. This is GORT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There are cries of amazement as Gort walks slowly ponderously, down the ramp to the ground. As he does so, the ramp closes behind him. Gort's face is, and always remains, utterly expressionless. He stops to look at Klaatu, lying on the ground. Then he looks around at the soldiers, the tanks and guns. All the guns have been traversing to follow him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - GORT

From inside him there comes an ominous crackling sound, as though power were being generated within him. His eyes flash toward the tank from which Klaatu was shot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. CLOSE SHOT - TANK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a great metallic clatter and the Sherman tank is suddenly reduced to a pile of junk metal, its parts completely disintegrated. Only a piece of tank track and twisted gun barrel emerge from the heap on the ground to identify what had been there. The tank's crew has remained unharmed.
</DIRECTION>

The crackling sound continues as his eyes start to sweep in a semicircle taking in all the troops.

MED. SHOT - THE TROOPS

<DIRECTION>
SHOOTING FROM BEHIND Gort, with the back of his head in f.g., CAMERA PANS to follow Gort's sweeping gaze. In a growing crash and clatter of metal, every weapon in sight is destroyed. The two machine guns are little heaps of junk. The 75's are larger heaps. The second tank, like the first, is a three-foot pile of scrap. Rifles have dropped from the soldier's hands and lie on the ground as little mounds of wood and metal. None of the men has been harmed, but their faces show the utter terror of what they have experienced.

Sudden pandemonium breaks out. Utterly terrified by what they have witnessed, the crowd becomes a wild, milling, screaming mob, concerned only with escape.

He is walking slowly, deliberately, menacingly toward the tank commander who fired on Klaatu. Standing by the debris of his tank, the man is immobilized with terror. The robot starts to reach out to grab him.

MED. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He has raised himself to a sitting position on the ground, his wounded shoulder giving him considerable pain. The two platoon leaders come into scene hesitantly, badly shaken by the awesome demonstration of power they have seen. They are uncertain as to what they should do. The platoon leader eyes the smashed object on the ground curiously and turns questioningly to Klaatu. With great dignity, Klaatu picks up the broken object, which we see well for the first time. It is a delicately-made tubular telescope, badly smashed. On it are indications of small electronic gadgets.

(evenly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sit down, Mr. Harley.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLAATU>
<DIRECTION>
Somewhat relieved, Harley seats himself. He speaks with a half smile, hoping to ease the tension.
</DIRECTION>
<HARLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sure I don't have to point out that your arrival was something of a surprise.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(getting a little

	<DIALOGUE>

do some fishing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Had you been traveling long?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARLEY>
<KLAATU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	About five months -- your months.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLAATU>
<HARLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must have come a long way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARLEY>
<KLAATU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	About 250 million of your miles.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLAATU>
<DIRECTION>
Harley glances at him quickly to be sure he's not joking. He's not.
</DIRECTION>
<HARLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Naturally we're very curious to know where it is you come from.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARLEY>
<KLAATU>
<DIRECTION>
(easily; he's a diplomat, too)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	From another planet. Let's just say that we're neighbors.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLAATU>
<DIRECTION>
Harley reacts, as his wildest assumptions are so blandly corroborated.
</DIRECTION>
<HARLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's rather difficult for us to think of another planet as a neighbor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARLEY>
<KLAATU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm afraid, in the present situation you'll have to learn to think that way.

<HARLEY>

(his eagerness apparent)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're very curious about that, too. Would you care to talk about it?

</HARLEY>
<KLAATU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd be glad to.

	Not now, of course -- with you alone.

<HARLEY>

	Perhaps you'd rather discuss it personally with the President--
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARLEY>
<KLAATU>
<DIRECTION>
(somewhat sharply)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is not a personal matter, Mr. Harley. It concerns all the people on your planet.

</KLAATU>
<HARLEY>
<DIRECTION>
(Startled by the scope of this statement)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I -- I'm not sure I understand--
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARLEY>
<KLAATU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to meet with representatives from all the nations of the Earth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLAATU>
<HARLEY>
<DIRECTION>
(shocked and perturbed by this notion)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm afraid that would be a little awkward. It's -- it's completely without precedent. And there are practical considerations -- the time involved -- the enormous distances.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARLEY>
<KLAATU>
<DIRECTION>
(coolly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I traveled 250 million miles. What about your United Nations?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLAATU>
<HARLEY>
<DIRECTION>
(Surprised and a little puzzled)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know about the United Nations?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARLEY>
<KLAATU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've been monitoring your radio broadcasts for a good many years. That's how we learned your languages. Lately, we've been getting your television also.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLAATU>
<HARLEY>
<DIRECTION>
(wryly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must have a rather strange impression of us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARLEY>
<KLAATU>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The first two years of television we were convinced that all you did was wrestle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLAATU>
<DIRECTION>
Harley smiles. Then his mind reverts to the seriousness of the situation and he speaks gravely.
</DIRECTION>
<HARLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sure you recognize from our broad- casts the evil forces that have produced the tension in our world. Surely you would agree--
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARLEY>
<KLAATU>
<DIRECTION>
(evenly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am not concerned, Mr. Harley, with the internal affairs of your planet. I consider that to be your business -- not mine.
	</DIALOGUE>

<HARLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was only hoping to make you understand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARLEY>
<KLAATU>
<DIRECTION>
(sternly, impressively)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My mission here is not to solve your petty squabbles. It concerns the existence of every last creature who lives on Earth.
	</DIALOGUE>

<HARLEY>
<DIRECTION>
(uncomfortably)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps if you could explain a little--
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARLEY>
<KLAATU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I intend to explain. To all the nations -- simultaneously.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(his manner precludes opposition)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do we proceed, Mr. Harley?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLAATU>
<DIRECTION>
Harley is thoroughly shaken. The tremendous force and power implicit in Klaatus's manner preclude the possibility of argument.
</DIRECTION>
<HARLEY>
<DIRECTION>
(after a long thoughtful moment)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We could call a special meeting of the General Assembly... But of course the UN doesn't represent all of the nations.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARLEY>
<KLAATU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then why not a meeting of all the Chiefs of State?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLAATU>
<HARLEY>
<DIRECTION>
(helplessly, but patiently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Believe me, you don't understand. They wouldn't sit down at the same table.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Growing a little impatient with such nonsense, Klaatu eyes him evenly, speaks with Jovian authority.
</DIRECTION>
<KLAATU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want to resort to threats, Mr. Harley. I simply tell you bluntly that the future of your planet is at stake... I suggest you transmit that message to the nations of the Earth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLAATU>
<DIRECTION>
The eyes of the two men meet for a long, silent moment. Then Harley rises quietly.
</DIRECTION>
<HARLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will make that recommendation to the President.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he picks up his brief case and hat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I must tell you in all honesty that I'm extremely dubious about the results.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARLEY>
<KLAATU>
<DIRECTION>
(with a half-smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Apparently I'm not as cynical about Earth's people as you are.

<HARLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been dealing in Earth's politics a good deal longer than you have.

CAMERA is on the back of a man dressed in a business suit, who is walking along the sidewalk of a dimly lighted, almost deserted, middle-class street. He carries a suitcase and he glances idly at the drab-looking stone facades of the old two-story houses. As he passes, from the open windows of the houses come the voices of radio announcers. We get a sentence or two from one house and then, as the man and our CAMERA pass on, this voice fades and another is picked up. We get the impression that everyone is glued to his radio.

He seems to hesitate, debating a plan he has in mind. He raises his right arm to scratch his head thoughtfully, and notices for the first time a small tag, or ticket, attached to the inside of the right forearm of the coat he is wearing. Puzzled, he pulls off the ticket and looks at it.

There 's no light in the room except what splashes in from the hall. Gathered around a television set are five adults and a little boy, their faces eerie in the reflected light from the screen.

Five of the boarders -- Mr. and Mrs. Barley, Mr. Krull, Helen Benson and Klaatu - are finishing their Sunday morning breakfast. Mrs. Barley is a middle-class Helen Hokinson lady, form and unrelenting. Her husband is a born complainer. Mr. Krull is a shriveled little accountant, precise and finicky. As they finish their coffee, all except Helen are immersed in the Sunday papers. Helen seems preoccupied with her own thoughts. From a portable radio on the table comes Gabriel Heater's voice.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL_HEATER_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--and so, this Sunday morning, we ask the question that's been plaguing; the entire nation for two days now: "Where is this creature and what is he up to?" If he can build a space ship that can fly to Earth -- and a robot that can destroy our tanks and guns -- what other terrors can he unleash at will? ...Obviously we must find this monster. We must track him down like a wild animal and destroy him.

It is a full page layout, in the style of the American Weekly, showing a demented artist's conception of a mass invasion of space ships.

The two men burst out laughing and move off together. Bobby, who has missed the point of this by-play, looks at Klaatu, then after the men. As they move out of scene they laugh loudly at the little boy's confusion. Klaatu takes Bobby's hand to lead him away from the roped-off area.

The house is an unimposing old-fashioned structure, shouldered on either side by similar one-family dwellings. There is a flight of stone steps leading up to the entrance and a large porch across the front of the house. Klaatu and Bobby walk into scene and pause, Klaatu glances at Bobby and Bobby nods toward the house. They move on up the steps to the entrance.

FULL SHOT - BARNHARDT'S STUDY

<DIRECTION>
SHOOTING through the window, over the heads of Klaatu and Bobby. The room is more of a workroom than a study. It is in comfortably shabby disarray, with papers and books everywhere. There's a battered old desk and a day bed. One wall is solid bookshelves and on the other two are blackboards covered with a fantastic array of complex equations, graphs and diagrams.

His attention has been caught by one of the blackboards and he studies it with great interest and curiosity.

MED. CLOSE SHOT - SECTION OF BLACKBOARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is covered with a particularly complicated series of equations in a chalky scrawl, involving angles of vector, Keplerian ellipses, etc. The final equations are unsolved; they have no answers after the "equals" sign. Across are little printed signs tacked to the blackboard reading: "Don't erase!" and "Don't touch!"

An efficient-looking middle-aged woman is mounting the steps to the entrance, getting her front door key out of her purse, when her eye falls on the French doors, which are standing ajar. Puzzled, she starts down the porch toward the doors. This woman is Barnhardt's secretary and her name is HILDA.

Bobby is watching as Klaatu writes across the blackboard in a bold hand: Differentiate the equation ( ).

With a polite nod he goes out the French doors, followed by Bobby. Hilda eyes the door for a moment, then glances down at the paper in her hand, disturbed and puzzled by this stranger. Her glance wanders to the blackboard and she picks up an eraser, debating whether to erase Klaatu's corrections. At that moment the French door opens and Klaatu sticks his head in. Startled, Hilda drops the eraser.
</DIRECTION>
<KLAATU>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing to the blackboard)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wouldn't erase that. The Professor needs it very badly.

And he disappears, leaving Hilda to glare after him in impotent rage. Deciding that this man is either a crackpot or a menace, she goes to the telephone on the desk and starts dialing a number.

Klaatu and the Detective nod to Helen and they go out. Helen watches the door close with real concern, wondering why the police want Klaatu and hoping he hasn't done anything wrong. Still disturbed, she turns to lead Bobby upstairs.

INT. POLICE STATION - FULL SHOT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The place is crowded and there is a feeling of feverish but well-ordered activity. Unidentified people who have been picked up in the search for the space man are being screened by the police. They are all men -- all between forty and sixty years old -- and they are from all walks of life. A series of desks have been arranged in a row, with signs over them reading IDENTIFICATION. At each desk is a team of cops and before each desk is a line of men waiting to be screened. At the far end of the room Klaatu can be seen at the desk of a Police Lieutenant, with the detective who picked him up.

MED. CLOSE SHOT - AT LIEUTENANT'S DESK

A Detective Lieutenant in plain clothes is questioning Klaatu, who stands beside the Detective who brought him in. The Lieutenant is a rugged but dignified man about fifty, intelligent and businesslike.

The lieutenant shifts in his chair, annoyed that he has to deal with this madman. He glances at a report on his desk, trying to control his impatience.

EXT. POLICE STATION - TWO SHOT - KLAATU AND DETECTIVE

as they come out of the station. Klaatu hesitates a moment, looks around. His face reveals nothing, but he seems to be momentarily considering the idea of making a break. The Detective, sensitive to such a possibility, hooks his arm under Klaatu's and nods his head toward the sidewalk in silent command. Klaatu allows himself to be led off.

She gestures them toward the half-open door of Barnhardt's study, where Barnhardt can be seen puzzling over the problem on the blackboard. The Captain knocks on the open door to attract his attention and enters with Klaatu.

He steps out into the hall, closing the door. Barnhardt continues to study Klaatu for a moment, then points to the notations he made on the blackboard. There is a controlled but anxious excitement in Barnhardt's attitude.
</DIRECTION>
<BARNHARDT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wrote this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARNHARDT>
<KLAATU>
<DIRECTION>
(nodding easily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was a clumsy way to introduce myself -- but I understand you're a difficult man to see.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(glancing at the
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	blackboard
	</DIALOGUE>

reproachfully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you'd have the solution by this time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLAATU>
<BARNHARDT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not yet. That's why I wanted to see you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARNHARDT>
<DIRECTION>
Klaatu glances at the work Barnhardt has been doing on the board. Then he points to one of the expressions in an equation.
</DIRECTION>
<KLAATU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All you have to do now is substitute this expression--
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing to a specific place)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--at this point.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLAATU>
<DIRECTION>
Impressed and interested, Barnhardt tugs at his chin as he studies and weighs the results.
</DIRECTION>
<BARNHARDT>
<DIRECTION>
(slowly, thoughtfully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes -- that will reproduce the first- order terms. But what about the effect of the other terms?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARNHARDT>
<KLAATU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Almost negligible... With variation of parameters, this is the answer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLAATU>
<BARNHARDT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How can you be so sure? Have you tested this theory?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARNHARDT>
<KLAATU>
<DIRECTION>
(with a slight smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I find it works well enough to get me from one planet to another.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Barnhardt stares at him blankly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I understand you've called a meeting to study our space ship.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLAATU>

As though unsure of what he's heard)

<KLAATU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My name is Klaatu.

<DIRECTION>
(noting that

	<DIALOGUE>
	Barnhardt's expression is changing from amazement to
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
incredulity)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I spent two days at your Walter Reed Hospital. Room 309. My doctor's name was Major White -- and I had a very attractive nurse called Ruth, who's getting married next Wednesday.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Klaatu waits for
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	this to sink in, then speaks with

quiet authority)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you are not interested -- or if you intend to turn me over to your Army -- we needn't waste any more time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLAATU>
<DIRECTION>
Barnhardt hesitates for a long, thoughtful moment. Then he goes to the door, opens it and speaks to the Captain outside.
</DIRECTION>
<BARNHARDT>
<DIRECTION>
(to the Captain, his
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	voice a little

unsteady)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can go now, Captain. Please thank General Cutler and tell him -- tell him that I know this gentleman.

Barnhardt closes the door and turns to find Klaatu watching him with a faint smile. Barnhardt sinks into a chair, trying to adjust his mind.
</DIRECTION>
<KLAATU>

(dryly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have faith, Professor Barnhardt
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLAATU>
<BARNHARDT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It isn't faith that makes good science, Mr. Klaatu. Its curiosity.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(unable to conceal his interest)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sit down, please. I have several thousand questions to ask you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARNHARDT>
<KLAATU>
<DIRECTION>
(ignoring the invitation)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would like to explain something of my mission here.

</KLAATU>
<BARNHARDT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was my first question.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARNHARDT>
<KLAATU>
<DIRECTION>
(with some bitterness)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was my intention to discuss this officially -- with all the nations of the Earth -- but I was not allowed the Opportunity. I have come to realize since that your mutual fears and suspicions are merely the normal reactions of a primitive society.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(gathering his thoughts)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We know from scientific observation that you have discovered a rudimentary kind of atomic energy. We also know that you are experimenting with rockets.

</KLAATU>
<BARNHARDT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes -- that is true.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARNHARDT>
<KLAATU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In the hands of a mature civilization, these would not be considered weapons of aggression. But in the hands of your people--
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he shrugs and shakes his head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've observed your aggressive tendencies, and we don't trust you with such power.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLAATU>
<BARNHARDT>
<DIRECTION>
(puzzled)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you mean that you are afraid of us--

</BARNHARDT>
<KLAATU>
<DIRECTION>
(with cool impressive emphasis)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We want to be sure you don't make -- let us say -- an unfortunate mistake. We know the potentiality of these developments and we are disturbed to find them in the hands of children... You see, we've had atomic energy for five thousand of your years.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(indicating the telephone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We discarded instruments like this many centuries ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he paces thoughtfully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So long as you were limited to fighting among yourselves -- with your primitive tanks and planes -- we were unconcerned. But soon you will apply atomic energy to space ships -- and then you become a threat to the peace and security of other planets. That, of course, we cannot tolerate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLAATU>
<BARNHARDT>
<DIRECTION>
(thoughtful and impressed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These other planets -- do they have peace and security?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARNHARDT>
<KLAATU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We had our atomic wars -- thousands of years ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he smiles wryly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	After that we fought with bows and arrows. Then, slowly, we learned that fighting is no solution -- that aggression leads to chaos.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLAATU>
<BARNHARDT>
<DIRECTION>
(with deep conviction)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We scientists understand this. Even we primitive scientists.

(Straightforwardly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What exactly is the nature of your mission, Mr. Klaatu?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARNHARDT>
<KLAATU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I came here to warn you that, by threatening danger, your planet faces danger -- very grave danger. I am prepared, however, to offer a solution.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLAATU>
<BARNHARDT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you care to be more specific?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARNHARDT>
<KLAATU>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	What I have to say must be said to all concerned.

(with a suggestion of deference to Barnhardt)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is too important to be entrusted to any individual.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLAATU>
<DIRECTION>
Barnhardt is forced reluctantly to accept Klaatu's refusal to go any further. After a moment's thought, he speaks seriously, but with a twinkle in his eye.
</DIRECTION>
<BARNHARDT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I gather that your efforts on the official level were not entirely successful.

<DIRECTION>
(sternly, as this
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	unpleasant episode

	<DIALOGUE>
	I come to you as a last resort -- and I confess that my patience is wearing thin.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(with Jovian annoyance)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Must I take drastic action in order to get a hearing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLAATU>
<BARNHARDT>
<DIRECTION>
(uneasily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What -- what sort of action do you mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARNHARDT>
<KLAATU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Violent action -- since that seems to be the only thing you people understand.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leveling the island of Manhattan, perhaps -- or dropping the Rock of Gibraltar into the sea.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLAATU>
<DIRECTION>
Barnhardt stands staring at him for a moment, passes his hand across his brow. Then, as Klaatu watches, Barnhardt paces the floor, trying to digest what he has heard. After a moment, he turns to Klaatu.
</DIRECTION>
<BARNHARDT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you be willing to meet with the group of scientists I am calling together?. Perhaps you could explain your mission to them, and they in turn could present it to their various peoples.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARNHARDT>
<KLAATU>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly, evenly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what I came to see you about.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLAATU>
<DIRECTION>
Barnhardt flings him a glance, then looks momentarily sheepish. But his own eagerness carries him on. He paces the floor thoughtfully.
</DIRECTION>
<BARNHARDT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is not enough to have men of science. We scientists are too easily ignored -- or misunderstood. We must get important men from every field. Educators -- philosophers -- church leaders -- men of vision and imagination -- the finest minds in the world.

	I leave that in your hands.

	<DIALOGUE>
	You'd have no objection to revealing yourself at this meeting?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARNHARDT>
<KLAATU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No -- not at all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLAATU>
<BARNHARDT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about your personal safety in the meantime? What about the Army -- and the police?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARNHARDT>
<KLAATU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My name is Carpenter and I'm a very earthy character living in a respectable boarding house.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLAATU>
<BARNHARDT>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling, but a little concerned)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm afraid I can't offer you any real protection. I have no influence in cases of inter-planetary conspiracy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARNHARDT>
<KLAATU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sure I'll be quite safe until the meeting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLAATU>
<BARNHARDT>
<DIRECTION>
(he suddenly pauses, thoughtfully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One thing, Mr. Klaatu. Suppose this group should reject your proposals. What is the alternative?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARNHARDT>
<KLAATU>
<DIRECTION>
(with a sense of quiet, inescapable power)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm afraid you have no alternative. In such, a case the planet Earth would have to be--
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he looks for the right word)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--eliminated.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLAATU>
<DIRECTION>
The implications of this statement leave Barnhardt speechless, his keen mind reeling.
</DIRECTION>
<BARNHARDT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Such power exists?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARNHARDT>
<KLAATU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I assure you such power exists.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLAATU>
<DIRECTION>
Barnhardt stands silent for a moment, trying to collect his shattered thoughts. Klaatu watches him as he starts pacing again.
</DIRECTION>
<BARNHARDT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The people who came to the meeting must be made to realize this. They must understand what is at stake.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(after a thoughtful moment, he looks up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mentioned a demonstration of force--
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARNHARDT>
<KLAATU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLAATU>
<BARNHARDT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would such, a demonstration be possible before the meeting?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARNHARDT>
<KLAATU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes -- of course.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLAATU>
<BARNHARDT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something that would dramatize for them and for their people the seriousness of the situation. Something that would affect the entire planet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARNHARDT>
<KLAATU>
<DIRECTION>
(with a nod)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That can easily be arranged.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLAATU>
<BARNHARDT>
<DIRECTION>
(frightened by his
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	easy assumption of
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
infinite power)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wouldn't want you to harm anybody -- or destroy anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARNHARDT>
<KLAATU>
<DIRECTION>
(easily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you leave it to me? I'll think of something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLAATU>
<BARNHARDT>
<DIRECTION>
(with a nervous half- smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe a little demonstration.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARNHARDT>
<KLAATU>
<DIRECTION>
(thinking about it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something dramatic -- but not destructive.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(intellectually amused)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's quite an interesting problem.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Barnhardt nods vaguely)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would day after tomorrow be all right? Say about noon?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLAATU>
<DIRECTION>
Klaatu's bland manner leaves Barnhardt shaken, almost wishing he'd never started this business.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM - BOARDINGHOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is about 3:30 the following evening. Helen is sitting in a chair leafing through a magazine. She is dressed to go out. A corner of the dining room can be seen, where Mr. and Mrs. Barley are playing cards with Mr. Krull. Mrs. Crockett, the landlady, enters from the hall on her way to the dining room and notices Helen.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_CROCKETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Going out, dear?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_CROCKETT>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I'm waiting for Tom to pick me up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MRS_CROCKETT>
<DIRECTION>
(with a shudder)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Personally, I won't go out after dark these days.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(with an attempt at slyness)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But then -- I'm not courting, am I?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_CROCKETT>
<DIRECTION>
She turns to go on into the dining room and as she does so almost bumps into Klaatu who is coming out, having been kibitzing the card game.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_CROCKETT>
<DIRECTION>
(thoroughly startled)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh -- Mr. Carpenter--!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_CROCKETT>
<DIRECTION>
Klaatu steps aside as she hurries nervously into the dining room. He turns, puzzled, to find Helen watching with a slight smile.
</DIRECTION>
<KLAATU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everyone seems so--
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he shakes his hands
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	to indicate
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
nervousness)
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jittery is the word.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
Helen watches him, a little uneasy in his presence. She is fond of him, and she can't help being curious and concerned about his brush with the police.
</DIRECTION>
<KLAATU>
<DIRECTION>
(with a contemplative smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bobby's the only person I know who isn't -- Jittery.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLAATU>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He has his homework to keep him occupied.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<KLAATU>
<DIRECTION>
(fondly, sincerely)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's a fine boy, Mrs. Benson.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLAATU>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Naturally I think so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<KLAATU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Warm and friendly and intelligent--
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(thoughtfully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know -- he's the only real friend I've made since I've been here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLAATU>
<DIRECTION>
Helen is deeply moved by Klaatu's affection for the boy, She tried to dismiss her curiosity about him, but she can't. She decides to face it.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
(hesitantly and with some difficulty)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Carpenter -- this is none of my business, but -- why did that detective come here last night?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<KLAATU>
<DIRECTION>
(with easy frankness)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh -- they just wanted to ask me a few questions. Bobby and I tried to see Professor Barnhardt in the afternoon, but he wasn't in. Apparently they thought I was looking for secrets of some kind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLAATU>
<DIRECTION>
Helen has reacted in puzzlement at this second mention of Barnhardt. They are interrupted by the ringing of the doorbell. Helen goes to answer it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Helen opens the front door to admit Tom. He appears impatient, anxious to get going.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello--
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You ready?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will be in just a minute.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<TOM>
<DIRECTION>
(a little annoyed
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	that she hasn't her coat on, he consults
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
his watch)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The picture starts at eight-fifty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
(in explanation)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was talking to Mr. Carpenter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<TOM>
<DIRECTION>
(lightly, but with
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	real sarcasm
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
underneath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope Mr. Carpenter won't think I'm intruding.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
Helen tries to shush him, to indicate Klaatu is in the next room, when Klaatu appears in the doorway. He must have heard Tom's remark, and there is an awkward moment. Klaatu is completely unperturbed, but Helen is embarrassed.
</DIRECTION>
<KLAATU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me. I was just going up to my room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLAATU>
<HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
(guiltily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goodnight, Mr. Carpenter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
Klaatu stops and turns to face them pleasantly.
</DIRECTION>
<KLAATU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have a good time -- both of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLAATU>
<DIRECTION>
He goes on up the stairs. Helen steers Tom toward the living room.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you wait in here while I get my things?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they enter from the hall, Helen turns to Tom reproachfully.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Tom, that was awful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<TOM>
<DIRECTION>
(momentary apologetic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. I guess I'm just tired of hearing about Mr. Carpenter.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Helen shushes him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't like the way he's attached himself to you and Bobby. After all, what do you know about him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
This touches on Helen's own private doubts, and she cannot answer.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll go get my things.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
She turns quickly and goes into the hall and hurries up the stairs. Tom looks after her, dismissing the matter with a shake of the head and a philosophical sigh. Of such stuff are women made.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Helen reaches the top of the stairs, crosses to her room and grabs a coat off the bed. She's putting it on as she moves down the hall to Bobby's room, the door of which is open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BOBBY'S ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby is at a table doing his homework and Klaatu has just finished explaining an arithmetic problem to him, as Helen enters, still putting on her coat.
</DIRECTION>
<KLAATU>
<DIRECTION>
(about to leave)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All you have to remember is, first find the common denominator -- then subtract.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLAATU>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, Mr. Carpenter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<KLAATU>
<DIRECTION>
(to Helen, pleasantly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll say goodnight again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLAATU>
<DIRECTION>
Helen is embarrassed. She would like to apologize for the awkwardness downstairs but she doesn't quite know how to go about it.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Carpenter, I--
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(it's too complicated; she can't do it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goodnight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<KLAATU>
<DIRECTION>
(with a warm smile of
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	complete understanding
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
and appreciation)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goodnight, my dear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLAATU>
<DIRECTION>
He turns and goes out, closing the door. A little distracted, Helen turns to Bobby.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go to bed, darling. You can finish that in the morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Helen watches as he starts to put away his work. She wants to tell him something, but finds it difficult to say.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
(hesitantly, almost guiltily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bobby -- I think it would be better if we didn't see quite so much of Mr. Carpenter
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
(shocked, and bewildered)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gee, why, Mom? He's my best friend... And he's awful good in arithmetic. He even helps Professor Barnhardt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you and Mr. Carpenter really go to see Professor Barnhardt?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure we did! He wasn't there but we went to see him. And Mr. Carpenter showed him how to do his arithmetic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Helen is surprised to get this corroboration for Klaatu's story. Sensing his mother's uneasiness, the boy looks for something intriguing -- some deep, dark secret.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
(shrewdly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mom -- is there something wrong with Mr. Carpenter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean, dear?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean -- on account of that policeman last night.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(his eyes light up hopefully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think he's a bank robber, maybe? Or a gangster?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, dear, of course not. He's a very nice man. I Just think he might prefer to be left alone. Now you get to bed and forget about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she kisses him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Night, darling.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
With a reassuring smile, she starts for the door.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goodnight.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(stopping her in the
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	doorway, his imaginative suspicions
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
mounting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey Mom -- why would he want to be alone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Not wanting to go into this any further, Helen blows him a kiss and backs out, closing the door. Bobby stands thinking for a moment, his mind still speculating on all sorts of wonderful possibilities. Still preoccupied, he drifts over to his bed and sits down to take of his shoes. He drops the first one to the floor and is starting on the other, when there is a light rap on his door. The door opens and Klaatu appears.
</DIRECTION>
<KLAATU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bobby -- have you a flashlight?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLAATU>
<BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
(surprised by his
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	appearance and his
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
request)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah -- sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he goes to a drawer
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	and gets a large
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
hand flashlight)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a real Boy Scout flashlight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby hands him the light, studying his face with eager curiosity.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you want it for, Mr. Carpenter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<KLAATU>
<DIRECTION>
(evasively)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why -- the light in my room went out.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(cutting off further questions)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Bobby. Goodnight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLAATU>
<DIRECTION>
Klaatu goes out, closing the door behind him. Bobby hesitates a moment, puzzled and curious. Then he goes over to the door, flips off the lights, and slowly, noiselessly opens the door a crack so he can peer out into the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
shooting down the hall through the crack in Bobby's door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Klaatu's door is ajar and through it the lights in his room can be seen burning brightly. Klaatu goes to his door, reaches in and flips off the lights and closes the door. He then scans the hall in both directions. Satisfied he isn't seen, he moves surreptitiously down the hall toward the stairs, still carrying the flashlight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED CLOSE SHOT - BOBBY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as he closes his door carefully, an expression of intense excitement on his face. What he has seem is certainly, unmistakably suspicious. Why did Mr. Carpenter lie to him? What does he want the flashlight for and where is he going? Bobby decides he's got to find out. Hurriedly he laces on the shoe he had taken off, and peers out the door to find the hall clear. He slips out the door, closing it behind him.

EXT. LARGE TEMPORARY BUILDING - LONG SHOT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is a temporary structure that has been erected to enclose the space ship and Gort. In front of the one small door are two soldiers, standing guard. Concealed in some foreground foliage, studying the layout, is Klaatu. Nearby 's a sign reading: KEEP OUT! This area OFF LIMITS to the public. U.S. ARMY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - BOBBY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is a short distance away, watching Klaatu eagerly.

<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as he studies the situation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
shooting over Klaatu's shoulder. As he watches, a Jeep filled with armed soldiers -- apparently regular patrol -- drives up to the entrance of the building. They stop for a moment while their Sergeant checks with the guards. Assured that everything is under control, the Sergeant signals his driver and the Jeep moves off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scanning the side of the building, he sees what he's looking for. Waiting until the Jeep disappears, he starts toward one side of the building, keeping himself concealed in the foliage.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as he leaves the concealing foliage and crosses the clear, grassy area surrounding the building. He stops and tries to see through the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. SHOT - GORT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
shooting through the barred window into the building. The huge robot looms large and eerie in the shadows cast by a couple of naked work-lights. His head is angled, away from the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. CLOSE SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Klaatu approaches the window. Aiming his flashlight at Gort, he flashes the light intermittently, as though signaling. (This should not approximate any known code.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. CLOSE SHOT - GORT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As we watch, the intermittent flashes of Klaatu's light appear on the wall ahead of Gort. Slowly, evenly, the robot's head turns to face the window.

MED. SHOT

from Gort's viewpoint, of the window, with Klaatu's light flashing its signals.

craning his neck to look for Klaatu, who has eluded his view. Suddenly he sees Klaatu again.

MED. SHOT - KLAATU
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
making his way behind the foliage toward the front of the building. Arriving at a point opposite the entrance, Klaatu waits and watches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. CLOSE SHOT - ENTRANCE TO BUILDING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two guards are standing in the doorway in positions of relaxed alertness. Suddenly, inside the building behind them, the giant figure of Gort looms silently in the doorway. His two great arms reach out, grab the two guards and drag then back inside the building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - BOBBY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He lets out an inaudible gasp as he sees this. Bug-eyed, he glances quickly to the point where he last saw Klaatu. He is amazed at what he sees.

from Bobby's viewpoint. Klaatu has emerged from the concealment of the tree-lined path and is making his way calmly toward the entrance of the building.

As he watches Klaatu enter the building, his curiosity conquers his fear and he starts tremblingly toward the structure.

EXT. BUILDING - MED. SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In *f.g., near the door, the two guards lie unconscious. As Klaatu walks toward the ship Gort slowly turns his head to follow him with him with eyes. Klaatu touches a point on the unbroken surface of the ship and the ramp silently swings out and down to the ground. Klaatu mounts the ramp and disappears inside the ship, whereupon the ramp silently closes.
</DIRECTION>

CLOSE SHOT - BOBBY

as he watches this; his eyes bulging. He can scarcely believe what he has seen. Suddenly a wave of sheer terror sweeps over him. Scrambling to his feet, he turns and runs wildly away.

INT. SMALL CORRIDOR - SPACE SHIP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA FOLLOWS Klaatu as he moves down the tiny, dimly lighted entrance corridor. He steps into the main cabin of the ship and flips a switch which bathes the cabin in a diffused, shadowless light. The walls are lined with a complex of mysterious gadgetry -- knobs, dials, indicators, etc. All of this should be as imaginative and unorthodox as possible, while still retaining a feeling of sound but highly advanced engineering.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. CLOSE SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Klaatu moves to the communications panel, flipping switches and turning dials. Indicators light up. There are crackling, whirring and buzzing sounds. Klaatu starts speaking into a built-in microphone in his own strange language. He speaks in rapid-fire explanation, continuing to talk, as we--

	Hey, what's this all about?

As he slows his cab down, Helen leans forward into scene. Frenzied, she is about to urge the driver on when Klaatu puts a restraining hand on her shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - MED. SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
shooting down the street from the barricade, as the taxi stops. Army cars are closing in behind the taxi, so it is trapped. The cab door ovens and Klaatu steps out, making a run for the entrance to a pedestrian underpass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. CLOSE SHOT - JEEP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is one of the lead vehicles in the group coming up behind the taxi. It mounts a .30 caliber machine gun and, with the Jeep still moving, the gunner fires a burst at Klaatu.

<DIRECTION>
He's on one of the vehicles that form the barricade. He takes a bead on the running figure of Klaatu and fires.

<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He has almost reached the underpass. His hand is on the railing when he slumps to the ground, badly hit. In a moment, Helen rushes into scene, dropping down to hold Klaatu's head in her arms. He looks up at her with a feeble smile. Then his face takes on an expression of urgency.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
(weakly, insistently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get that message to Gort. Right away--

Klaatu is unable to say any more. He is dead. Helen looks around wildly, helplessly, with tears and terror in her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the soldiers pile out of their vehicles and close in on the place where Klaatu lies. He is their first and all- important concern, and Helen finds herself pushed out of the way, toward the edge of the growing crowd of soldiers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shocked and, staggered by what's happened, she realizes she must get to Gort. Taking advantage of the milling confusion in the dark, she edges toward the pedestrian underpass until she can slip into its entrance without being noticed. And she disappears.

INT. BUILDING ENCLOSING SPACE SHIP - MED. SHOT - GORT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the eerie light of the huge building, the great robot stands encased in a solid block of clear, transparent plastic. As CAMERA MOVES IN slowly, we hear a low whirring sound, as of power being generated. A faint glow, visible through the plastic, emanates from Gort's body. His eyes, which seem to express rage, shifts as though he were straining to break out. As the whirring sound and the glow of Gort's body increase in intensity, the sharp edges at the top of the ice- like block melt into roundness and the plastic starts to drip away. (About 150 folding chairs are arranged on the floor near the space ship for the meeting tonight.)

</DIRECTION>

The whirring sound can be heard faintly from inside. The two soldiers standing guard at the door hear the sound and listen apprehensively. The two men exchange an uneasy glance. After hesitating a moment, one of them decides to investigate. He turns and goes inside the door.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he stops and looks up at the robot, his eyes go wide with terror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - GORT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gort is an awesome and terrifying sight. His head is free now and he seems to be straining against the plastic, which is dripping down the sides of the block.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - SOLDIER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He glances around nervously to see that his companion has entered the building and is staring up at the robot, bug- eyed. Slowly the second soldier moves up beside the first. Wordlessly, they bring their rifles up to the ready and click them off safety. In spite of their terror, they advance slowly toward the robot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - GORT

The whirring sound is ominous and his body glows brightly. And his eyes are fixed on the two advancing figures.

Hurrying along a footpath, nervous and distraught, she pauses for a moment, looking at the entrance of the building. Then she starts determinedly across the grass toward the entrance.

INT. BUILDING - MED. CLOSE SHOT - HELEN

<DIRECTION>
He has seen Helen and his flashing eyes bore into her. His upper body and arms are free now, and the plastic is rapidly melting away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - HELEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is held fascinated by the robot's staring eyes. For another moment it looks as if she would, break and run. But she summons all her courage, and moves slowly toward Gort, whose legs are still held captive.

MED. SHOT - HELEN AND GORT

<DIRECTION>
MED. CLOSE SHOT - GORT

The plastic is dripping off his legs now. With great effort, he pulls his legs free and steps out of the stuff. A huge figure in the heavy shadows, he moves slowly and menacingly toward Helen.

MED. CLOSE SHOT - HELEN

<DIRECTION>
as she stops advancing, rooted to the spot in fear. Then she starts backing away, keeping her eyes on him.

MED. SHOT - HELEN AND GORT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the great, hulking figure approaches, Helen can't stand her ground. She turns and runs wildly toward the far end of the building. Gort follows her with unhurried, inescapable strides. Unwittingly, Helen has run into a corner, and the robot is closing in on her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. CLOSE SHOT - HELEN
</DIRECTION>

Her eyes go wide with terror as she realizes she's trapped. In a wild effort to run around him, she stumbles and falls to the floor. Immobilized with fright, she lies breathless, looking up at him. Then she gives a piercing scream.

Helen watches him in an agony of suspense. Then the robot slowly bends down, picks her up in his arms and starts walking toward the space ship.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. SHOT
</DIRECTION>

PANNING with Gort as he carries Helen, speechless with fright, to the side of the ship. He touches the side, and the ramp moves slightly out. He mounts the ramp, still carrying Helen, and disappears into the ship with her. And the ramp closes silently behind them.

INT. SMALL CABIN - FULL SHOT

This is revealed as a weirdly equipped laboratory, the walls of which are lined with the most complex array of mechanical and electronic apparatus. Gort sets Helen down on a stool and indicates for her to stay there. Too terrified to move, Helen watches as he busies himself with the apparatus. He starts flipping switches and turning dials. As a result, lights begin to flash and there's a strange series of mechanical noises.

Unable to guess the reason for these preparations, she is gripped with a terrible fear.

This is a cell on the ground floor. In the far wall is a heavily barred window, beyond which is as alley. In f.g. are Klaatu's feet, stretched out on a crude table. As CAMERA HOLDS, the huge figure of Gort appears outside the barred window, Seeing Klaatu, he reaches up and yanks out the steel bars as though they were chicken wire. With a crushing blow of his knee he crumbles the brick and mortar below the window and steps inside the cell. He moves without interruption toward the body of Klaatu.

Alone in the cabin, Helen is still terrified. She looks up, startled as the door opens and Gort enters, carrying Klaatu's body over to a long counter.

Considerably agitated, the Colonel snaps orders to the other officers, glances at his watch and motions for the Lieutenant to follow him.

<DIRECTION>
(he pauses, studying the faces)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Universe grows smaller every day -- and the threat of aggression by any group -- anywhere -- can no longer be tolerated.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLAATU>
<DIRECTION>
MED. CLOSE SHOT - IN AUDIENCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
of three of the delegates, listening intently. (These three are from Russia, India and France.)
</DIRECTION>
<KLAATU_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(over scene)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There must be security for all -- or no one is secure... This does not mean giving up any freedom except the freedom to act irresponsibly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLAATU_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - A DELEGATE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is an American.
</DIRECTION>
<KLAATU_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(over scene)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your ancestors knew this when they made laws to govern themselves -- and hired policemen to enforce them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLAATU_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU
</DIRECTION>
<KLAATU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We of the other planets have long accepted this principle. We have an organization for the mutual protection of all planets -- and for the complete elimination of aggression. A sort of United Nations on the Planetary level... The test of any such higher authority, of course, is the police force that supports it. For our policemen, we created a race of robots--

<DIRECTION>
(indicating Gort)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Their function is to patrol the planets -- in space ships like this one -- and preserve the peace. In matters of aggression we have given them absolute power over us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLAATU>
<DIRECTION>
MED. CLOSE SHOT - GORT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
emphasizing his great size and inscrutable expression. The normal blinking of his piercing eyes as he gazes imperturbably at the audience is his only movement.
</DIRECTION>
<KLAATU_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(over scene)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At the first sign of violence they act automatically against the aggressor. And the penalty for provoking their action is too terrible to risk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLAATU_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU
</DIRECTION>
<KLAATU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The result is that we live in peace, without arms or armies, secure in the knowledge that we are free from aggression and war -- free to pursue more profitable enterprises.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(after a pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We do not pretend to have achieved perfection -- but we do have a system -- and it works.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(with straightforward candor)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I came here to give you the facts. It is no concern of ours how you run your own planet -- but if you threaten to extend your violence, this Earth of yours will be reduced to a burned- out cinder.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLAATU>
<DIRECTION>
QUICK REACTION CUTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
of four delegates, reflecting their stark terror and bewilderment. And a cut of the Colonel and the soldiers, impressed and held by what Klaatu is saying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY as he concludes quietly, incisively.
</DIRECTION>
<KLAATU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your choice is simple. Join us and live in peace. Or pursue your present course -- and face obliteration.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(after a pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We will be waiting for your answer. decision rests with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLAATU>
<DIRECTION>
By the time he reads the last line, the CAMERA HAS MOVED INTO a BIG HEAD CLOSEUP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. SHOT - THE DELEGATES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA MOVES along a row of their faces, stunned and silent, their minds unable to cope with the enormity of what they have heard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA MOVES IN on Klaatu as he is saying goodbye to Barnhardt and Helen. He turns then and speaks to Gort, glancing up at the building as he does so.
</DIRECTION>
<KLAATU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gort -- veracto.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KLAATU>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - GORT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up at the roof of the building, and once again we hear the peculiar generating sound from within him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. LONG SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
including the delegates, the space ship, everything that is inside the building. As we watch, the roof and walls of the temporary structure suddenly disintegrate as the tanks did in the opening. The entire layout -- delegates, space ship and all -- remain exactly as they were except that instead of being under a roof they are out in the open Mall under a starry sky. The area is ringed with the debris of the building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. SHOT AT SHIP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Klaatu is standing at the head of the ramp as Gort comes up the ramp and disappears inside the ship. Klaatu is nodding goodbye to Barnhardt and Helen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO SHOT - BARNHARDT AND HELEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as they wave to Klaatu. Barnhardt is moved and impressed, and Helen's face shows her emotions at this strange parting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He nods and smiles at them with warm affection. Then he turns and disappears into the ship, and the ramp closes behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. SHOT - THE SPACE SHIP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From inside the ship comes the muffled roar of great power generating -- not the sound of earthly motors, but of a tremendous dynamo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. SHOT - THE DELEGATES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
watching breathless, stunned by what they have heard and seen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. LONG SHOT - THE SHIP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the sound from inside it builds to a climax, the great ship takes off with a tremendous roar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REACTION CUTS OF DELEGATES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All are deeply moved and impressed. In the mind of each is the burning question that Klaatu has posed for them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LONG SHOT - THE SHIP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as it soars away into the inky blackness of the outer spaces from which it came.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
