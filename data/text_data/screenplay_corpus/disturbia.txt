FADE IN:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DEEP BLUE WATER FILLS THE FRAME.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And there... a few feet beneath the surface... something SHIMMERS in the sunlight. As ripples dissipate, we make out the shape of a bright yellow CRANKBAIT waiting patiently for its prey on the end of a 10-pound line.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hold on this for another silent beat... then -- a huge BLACK BASS suddenly swoops into frame, circling the bait!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON KALE BRECHT (17) AND HIS DAD, JEFF BRECHT (45)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Both startle at the sight. Kale, a clean-cut all-American kid, reflexively yanks back on his rod and reel.
</DIRECTION>
<KALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa, did you see that thing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KALE>
<DIRECTION>
Kale anxiously winds the spool --
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Settle down, slow it down...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff lightly puts his hand on Kale's, slowing the cranking to a slight, steady pull as we WIDEN TO REVEAL them standing near the stern of their 16-foot BASSMASTER. We are...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BISHOP LAKE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The undisturbed beauty of nature serves as our backdrop as we MOVE CLOSER to Kale and Jeff, taking note of their t- shirts: Jeff's has a silkscreened cartoon rendition of a Bass wearing aviator goggles with mounted missiles on its fins. Beneath it, the slogan: "Weapons of Bass Destruction." The fish on Kale's shirt wears a stock car uniform, a single word across the bottom: BASSCAR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Jeff steadies Kale's hand and pulls away:
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't want to scare him off. You've got his attention, now just play with him. Tease him a little.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
Kale and Jeff watch the water in anxious silence... Kale inching the line back toward the boat. One more crank, then --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The BLACK BASS suddenly ATTACKS THE LURE with a tremendous SLOSH OF HIS TAIL!
</DIRECTION>
<KALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holy shit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KALE>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all you, Kale, keep cranking!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
Kale cranks fast and furious. But this is one fish that's going down fighting.
</DIRECTION>
<KALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need reinforcements!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KALE>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff moves in, grabs the rod and reel from behind Kale.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Heave, laddie!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
They PULL. The rod curls under the weight.

<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How would ya know, have ya ever met one? I doubt it --

</JEFF>

The BASS SLOSHES FURIOUSLY around the bait, now just a few feet from the boat!

<KALE>

</KALE>
<JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
(laughing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never! No Brecht has ever -- lost a fight -- to a fish!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
The BASS suddenly snaps free. The line goes limp. Jeff and Kale lose their balance, nearly falling backward. Then --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All becomes silent save for Jeff and Kale's heavy breathing. Kale winds the empty line back to the boat, shoots a glance to Jeff, then throws the rod aside in mock disgust. Jeff takes a seat in the captain's chair.
</DIRECTION>

They both cast their lines --

Kale's attractive mom, JULIE, 40, on cordless, preps dinner.

Kale smiles as a LINCOLN NAVIGATOR PICK-UP zooms past in the right lane, swerves back in the left lane in front of them.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (over the above)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd say an hour. Love you, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff flips the phone shut, tosses it to Kale. They exchange smiles. A silent moment passes. They both turn to face the road as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE NAVIGATOR PICK-UP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
suddenly SWERVES back into the right lane, revealing a
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STALLED MINI-VAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
directly in front of them!
</DIRECTION>
<KALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	DAD --
	</DIALOGUE>
</KALE>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff instinctively reaches his arm in front of Kale as he SWINGS the wheel hard right and SLAMS ON THE BRAKES. But it's not in time. The
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
clips the mini-van's right rear bumper, SMASHING it into the left lane concrete barricade. The SUV spins into the right lane where that
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SLOW-MOVING PATHFINDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
suddenly BROADSIDES IT with such FORCE that it FLIPS the SUV up and over. It TUMBLES off the highway, barreling into...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. VACANT CLIFFSIDE PULLOFF/VIEWING AREA - EVENING - CONT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A couple of final, METAL-CRUNCHING FLIPS send the SUV's undercarriage CRASHING to a violent stop on top of a rickety wood beam-mounted GUARDRAIL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A silent beat. Then -- steam billows from the hood...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE SUV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Airbags deflate. Dust settles. Blood streams from Jeff's hairline. His eyes flutter open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up to Kale, strapped in the passenger seat, unconscious. A small gash on his forehead. We only see blue sky through Kale's shattered passenger window.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kale? -- Kale, are you okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
Kale opens his eyes. Jeff reaches up, touches Kale's face.
</DIRECTION>
<KALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KALE>
<DIRECTION>
Kale looks down at his dad -- his eyes widen in horror, not only at the sight of Jeff, but of the ravine beneath them --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For this brief moment, we may have thought the SUV was stable. But we CRANE BACK UP AND OUT KALE'S PASSENGER WINDOW to REVEAL A MUCH GRIMMER REALITY: the SUV is PERCHED LENGTHWISE ON TOP OF THE GUARDRAIL AT A 45-DEGREE DOWNWARD ANGLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SUV's right front and rear tires precariously grip the rail, keeping it from plunging 500 feet to the RAVINE below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK INSIDE THE SUV
</DIRECTION>
<KALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God, dad --
	</DIALOGUE>
</KALE>
<DIRECTION>
-- Jeff's leg is trapped beneath the crumpled dashboard.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm fine. But you're gonna have to climb out, Kale. Can you do that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
Kale's hands shake from the SHOCK as his fingers search for the seatbelt buckle. But the shoulder strap is LOCKED IN PLACE, preventing Kale from turning. He tugs it furiously.
</DIRECTION>
<KALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't -- It won't give --

<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's okay, I've got it -- grab the door, I don't need your ass falling on my face --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
Kale reaches up, grips the outside of the door as
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JEFF'S HAND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
shakily reaches to Kale's seatbelt buckle and presses. Kale's belt SNAPS LOOSE. Kale's body DROPS, but he hangs on to the window -- just as a
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GUARDRAIL BEAM SNAPS LOOSE FROM ITS FOUNDATION!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SUV ROCKS VIOLENTLY as the guardrail starts to bend and peel away from the cliffside under the SUV's weight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE SUV - JEFF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
reaches up, grabs Kale's legs and pushes, helping Kale climb out the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUTSIDE THE SUV - KALE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
slowly slides down the outside of the door, then turns around on his chest, reaches his hand back down to Jeff --
</DIRECTION>
<KALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad, here --

</KALE>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff reaches up as a
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SECTION OF GUARDRAIL RIVETS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
a few inches behind the SUV's rear bumper suddenly POP LOOSE. THE GUARDRAIL SNAPS IN TWO!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KALE SCREAMS, hangs on for dear life as the GUARDRAIL and SUV SWING OUT AND OVER THE RAVINE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The guardrail is buckling fast. Another beam RIPS FREE of its foundation -- Kale slides a few more inches down the door and right front fender allowing
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS FEET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
to find the edge of the foundering rail underneath. Having at least some footing, Kale reaches back inside --
</DIRECTION>
<KALE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad, please, you can do it --
	</DIALOGUE>
</KALE>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff unbuckles his belt and reaches up. Kale summons his strength, grabs Jeff's wrist, pulls him up and through the passenger window just as the
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUV FALLS AWAY!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff's weight pulls Kale down. Kale's feet SLIP off the rail. Kale SLAMS chest down, his TORSO wrapping around the top of the rail, feet dangling... But he's still clutching Jeff's wrist as the SUV CRASHES INTO THE RAVINE IN A MUSHROOM CLOUD OF DUST AND DEBRIS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JEFF'S WRIST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
slips from Kale's grasp. Kale struggles to hang on, but he's losing the battle and the balancing act. And he knows it. Tears well in Kale's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kale, you have to climb up --

CU - Jeff's left hand enters frame, clasps Kale's. Another beat of eyes on eyes. The guardrail continues to BUCKLE. Then -- Jeff starts to PRY KALE'S HAND AWAY --

Jeff's arm RELEASES FROM KALE'S GRIP. Kale opens his mouth to scream as a shrill bell RINGS!

The teacher, SENOR GUTIERREZ, a rotund 50, bad comb-over and khakis up to his naval, stands off to the side, quickly picking up on Ronnie's excessive and increasingly dramatic use of the word.

<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, that one could've been avoided.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<DIRECTION>
Kale looks back up. He's not smiling. Whatever chance we had of a lighter conversation panning out here quickly fizzles. Another beat, then -- Julie pushes her chair back, heads to the counter, grabs her apron and purse.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KALE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kale, looking disheveled and very perplexed, now has his TV pulled out from the wall. He's behind it, meticulously checking and re-connecting all the wires and ethernet cable. Carefully studying the manual as he goes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He blows on the Halo 2 CD, wipes it down with his sweatshirt, gently puts it in the tray, giving us the idea this might not be his first attempt at this.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He powers up the Xbox, grabs a controller... so far, so good... he scrolls through the screens, a little hope returning... SERVER ERROR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kale throws a mini-fit, slams the controller to the floor. Rips the controller cord out of the XBOX --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KALE'S BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A few stray beams of sunlight pierce the blinds. Otherwise, it's a tomb. Clothes strewn everywhere. We TRACK ACROSS the floor and a virtual DEBRIS FIELD of junk food bags, wrappers, Mountain Dew cans... find Kale in bed, ankle and bracelet stick out from the sheets, arm hangs over the side --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Still a mess as we find Kale, hair disheveled, rummaging through the cabinets. Lots of Costco-size boxes: crackers, Pringles... a HUGE BOX OF TWINKIES. Kale spots a jar of peanut butter. He grabs the nearest bowl, pulls a bottle of Hershey's syrup from the fridge, pours it all into the bowl.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's about to throw the syrup bottle in the trash when something in the bottom of the can catches his eye. He reaches in, pulls out a bill for XBOX LIVE: SUBSCRIPTION CANCELED.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kale lounges in on the couch watching "The Price is Right" as he spoons the peanut butter from the jar, dips it in the bowl of chocolate syrup, devours it. Brings up a two-liter of Mountain Dew, takes a big swig to wash it down.

Kale belches as he raises his spoon, saluting the screen. Then, after a beat, a look of grave concern crosses his face --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. 2ND FL HALL OUTSIDE BATHROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The toilet flushes O.S. Kale opens the door, leans against the frame, spent. He stands there a beat, absorbing the silence of the house. He eyes a door at the end of the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. 2ND FL HALL OUTSIDE DAD'S OFFICE - DAY - SECONDS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CU - the doorknob. Kale's hand enters frame, slowly turns it. Click. Kale pushes. The door CREAKS open to reveal
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAD'S OFFICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hardwood floor. Ornate, cherry wood desk. Plush leather chairs. Quiet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE DESK -- dad's reading glasses sit on a stack of papers next to an antique typewriter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE WALLS -- adorned with framed, poster-size covers of Dad's books - non-fiction, true account titles: WHISTLEBLOWER - The Inside Story of a Real Corporate Insider; THE SENATOR'S SHADOWS: How Eight Men Conspired to Control One.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON ANOTHER WALL -- a family portrait of Jeff, Julie, and Kale - age six; Jeff at a book signing, smiling wide...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kale takes it all in from the doorway. His feet never once cross into the room. His eyes say everything. Loss, anger, regret. He gently pulls the door shut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KALE'S BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kale samples some rap clips on I-tunes. Likes what he's hearing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE SCREEN - Kale moves the cursor to "buy song." The account screen pops up. Kale types his password.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a beat, bold red letters pop up: "THE APPLE ID OR PASSWORD YOU ENTERED WAS INVALID OR INCORRECT..." Kale types it again. Same thing. Then -- like we all do to be sure, Kale types his password at a rate of ONE KEY PER SECOND. Same thing. Kale fumes, smelling a rat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KALE'S BEDROOM - DAYS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shades are drawn. Kale's door is closed. Find Kale looking utterly miserable, lounging in bed watching "Bikini Destinations" on HD NET. Julie enters wearing a business suit and name badge emblazoned with the RE/MAX LOGO. Kale quickly changes the channel to the local news.

Kale SHOVELS dishes and glasses into the dishwasher, breaking a couple as he goes. He pours half the box of Cascade in the dispenser, kicks the door up and closed, cranks the knob.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KALE'S BEDROOM - DAY - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kale sits on his bed, staring into space. He eyes the clock. Tick tick tick... We hear KIDS PLAYING IN THE STREET O.S.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kale glances out the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS POV - Kids on bikes, NEIGHBORS out on walks... ahh... the sights and sounds of summer... And Kale's not invited. He glares down at his ankle bracelet. It glares back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KALE'S BEDROOM - DAY - LATER
</DIRECTION>

Kale sits on the floor as he spreads a line of Elmer's glue across the bottom of a Twinkie. He's just completed the first couple of floors of what will be... TWINKIE TOWER.

<KALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait, Ronnie -- Hello?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KALE>

Kale tosses the phone and the nail polish aside. Sits there in silence for a beat. Then eyes a racketball on the floor. Picks it up. Starts mindlessly bouncing it against the wall... and keeps bouncing it... and keeps bouncing it...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HARD CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KALE'S BEDROOM - DAY - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kale reclines in his chair, now FURIOUSLY SWATTING the racketball against the wall -- with a racket. We PULL BACK to reveal SCUFF MARKS on the walls and CEILING where Kale has figured out the exact points to hit it allowing him to bounce the ball off multiple walls and return it perfectly to his hand. He SWATS it... and SWATS it...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KALE'S BEDROOM - DAY - STILL LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kale's passed out in his chair, the racket still in his hand. He's about to fall out of the chair when a loud BANG O.S. JOLTS him awake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY/WINDOW - DAY - SECONDS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kale goes to the window, tilts his head, trying to see where the noise is coming from.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KALE'S POV - He's able to make out some bits of movement next door, but his VIEW is OBSTRUCTED by the architecture of his house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kale steps back from the window, studies it a beat -- then opens it, slowly sticks his head out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS POV - A U-HAUL TRUCK comes into view. It's backed into the driveway next door. ALAN NORRIS, 43, appears from inside the truck's cab, carrying a moving box. He hands it down to his wife, BONNIE, 42, who walks back in the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kale's about to pull his head in when another PERSON comes out of the moving truck. She's carrying a box that's obscuring her face as she carefully negotiates the incline of the moving truck's ramp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But her blonde hair and perfect legs look to be about 17. We'll soon know her as ASHLEY, the Norris' daughter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches the end of the ramp. Bends over to retrieve another smaller box, her back and ass to Kale who stares in utter disbelief. Ashley stacks the boxes, picks them up and heads into the house, her face still a mystery.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kale watches her go. Mesmerized. Suddenly, the DOORBELL RINGS O.S. Kale snaps to, yanks his head back in -- and KERBONGS it on the underside of the window. He drops to the floor.
</DIRECTION>

Kale swings the door open to see -- A BURNING PAPER BAG on the welcome mat.

Kale instinctively STOMPS ON IT with his SOCKED FEET!
</DIRECTION>
<KALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh shit! Shit water shit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KALE>
<DIRECTION>
Kale frantically hops around, looking for a hose, bucket, anything wet -- but the flames are already out. Kale looks down, finally realizes this -- but there's another problem -- his socks are smothered in SLIMY DOG SHIT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear GIGGLING O.S. Kale glances up as two neighborhood BRATS on bikes emerge from their hiding place behind a shrub across the street. They high five each other.
</DIRECTION>
<BRAT_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What a retard!

Kale glares -- then heads down the steps into...

Kale walks briskly, menacingly toward them --

<KALE>

The Brats grow more concerned, back away as Kale draws closer--

<KALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not before I shove this shit up your ass!

The brats pedal away. Kale races through the sprinkler, crossing his yard into the far corner of Ashley's, trying to cut the Brats off as they race down...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - DAY - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The chase is on. Kale increases his speed. Almost catching up to them --
</DIRECTION>
<BRAT_2>

(terrified to Brat #1)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dude, you said he couldn't leave his house!!

</DIRECTION>
<KALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit!

Kale races back down the street, his shit-stained feet leaving tracks as he goes. He cuts through Ashley's yard again, yelling at the bracelet all the way--

	No, c'mon, I'm way inside, turn green --

He spins back toward the house, runs SMACK into the STREAMS, trips on the sprinkler, falls on his face. Now his foot's tangled in the sprinkler. Spraying water all over him. Kale's foot jiggles the sprinkler free. He then sees the ankle bracelet: GREEN LIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<KALE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes! That's what I'm talking about!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KALE>
<DIRECTION>
He gazes over: ASHLEY'S PARENTS, EACH WITH A MOVING BOX, STAND THERE, JAWS DROPPED. BOTH TAKE A NERVOUS STEP BACKWARD as ASHLEY steps out the front door. Freezes at the sight of the sopping wet, shit-and-grass-stained Kale. Kale locks eyes with her. Then smiles and waves.

<DIRECTION>
PRELAP - The doorbell RINGS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KALE'S HOUSE - ENTRY HALL - THAT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kale, his Louisville Slugger firmly in hand, groggily heads to the door, swings it open. COURIER. With papers.
</DIRECTION>
<COURIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, I'm from McNeill-Stewart law firm, dropping off for Ms. Julie --
	</DIALOGUE>
</COURIER>
<DIRECTION>
Over this, Kale yanks the envelope away, SLAMS the door in the guy's face. Kale heads away. The doorbell RINGS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kale opens the door, grabs the courier's clipboard, signs his name, SLAMS THE DOOR EVEN HARDER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. KALE'S BACK YARD - THE NEXT DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON KALE'S FEET - entering frame, inching their way through the yard...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE BRACELET - The green light suddenly goes out, red light FLASHES. Kale's foot quickly steps back. GREEN LIGHT. A beat, then --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SMILING GARDEN GNOME SLAMS DOWN INTO FRAME.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER - Kale ties kite string around the gnome's hat, then unspools it across the yard to a waiting croquet mallet already hammered into the ground. He pulls the string taut and ties it off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We PULL BACK to REVEAL Kale's emerging KITE STRING PERIMETER -- a crude SEMI-CIRCULAR ARC around the yard tied off at different points using makeshift "stakes" -- gnomes, mallets, shovels, screwdrivers...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. KALE'S FRONT YARD - DAY - SHORT TIME LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Same "BOUNDARY CONSTRUCTION" here. Kale shoves a screwdriver into the ground a few feet shy of his mailbox. He ties some string to it as he glances over to the other neighbors' (the PILCH's) yard, sees their black Labra-doodle watching him.
</DIRECTION>
<KALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey doggie, come here...

Kale stands in the doorway. He takes a moment, considering what he's about to do. Then -- HIS FOOT steps inside. He goes to the window, gently pulls the blind up to reveal the
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK OF ASHLEY'S HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He peers down, sees Ashley and her mom standing by the swimming pool. Ashley disappears through the back door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kale tilts his head up, curiously gazing through the pair of OPEN WINDOWS on the SECOND FLOOR of Ashley's house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS POV - ASHLEY'S BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unmade bed, stacks of open moving boxes, poster frames waiting to be hung... Kale squints, steps closer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ASHLEY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
enters the room. Digging clothes from boxes, stuffing them in her dresser, then -- she pulls her hair back, yanks off her t-shirt, revealing a black bra.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON KALE - he continues to watch as Ashley digs a towel out of a moving box, and, with her back to us, pulls off the bra and disappears into the bathroom. Off Kale --

REVERSE ANGLE TO REVEAL KALE - now with a patchy stubble, wearing a bathrobe and a SHRUNKEN t-shirt that used to be white but is now LIGHT PINK. He holds his bat in one hand, quart of Haagen Dazs in the other. He smiles, hugs Ronnie. Tight -- and not letting go --

As the stationwagon heads up the driveway, Kale tries to push himself upright -- but his feet SLIP. He pitches forward more. He glances back over his shoulder, sees Ashley getting out of the car and looking his way. Kale struggles under his own weight, trying to keep his feet from crossing the line -- he looks back to Ashley who's now heading toward him. A slight smile crosses Kale's face as --

Kale watches the vacant room... waiting... another beat, then -- Ashley emerges from the bathroom with a box of tissues. She sits on her bed, pulls THREE TISSUES from the box, staring off...

Ronnie tip-toes to the door. One look at Ashley and he covers his mouth, grabs Kale and pulls him back.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit shit!! Oh my shit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Both laugh, giggle, acting "girlie," practically spinning in circles as they speak in hushed, panicked whispers:
</DIRECTION>
<KALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She totally saw us --
	</DIALOGUE>
</KALE>
<DIRECTION>
The DOORBELL RINGS again. Kale heads to the door.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNIE>

<KALE>

(re: his bracelet)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dude, she knows I'm here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KALE>

Kale swings the door open. Ashley stands there a beat. Her arms folded. Then --
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What took you so long?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(eyeing Ronnie in b.g.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The house isn't that big.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<KALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, no, we were playing upstairs --

Ronnie cringes at how that sounded.

<RONNIE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Video games...?

</RONNIE>
<KALE>

(awkward beat; then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So... what brings you here.

</KALE>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. -- Locked out.

</ASHLEY>
<KALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you need to call anyone?

</KALE>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, but I'd rather stay stranded if you don't mind.

</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Kale and Ronnie trade glances.

<ASHLEY>

	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<KALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, sure, come on in --

</KALE>
<DIRECTION>
Ashley steps inside, glances around, checking out the place.
</DIRECTION>
<KALE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's Ronnie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KALE>
<ASHLEY>

	Nice to meet you. Video games, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then suggestively to Kale)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like to play.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>

Kale trades a look with Ronnie as Ashley nonchalantly heads up the stairs.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KALE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KALE'S BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ashley barges in, instantly struck by the mess. Kale pushes past her, starts grabbing underwear and garbage off the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<KALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a little messy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KALE>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A little?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Kale keeps gathering clothes, tossing them to Ronnie who tosses them in the closet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ashley picks up the binoculars from the window sill, peers outside.
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anything interesting out there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Kale and Ronnie trade looks. Ashley turns around, binoculars still raised, aiming them like a gun at Kale.
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you spying on the neighbors, Kale?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>

Kale freezes.

<RONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
(stepping in)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, he is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Kale's eyes widen in panic.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See, he has this neighbor -- who I guess by definition would also be your neighbor -- who may, in point of fact, be a cold-blooded killer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Ronnie points out the window to Giles' house.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exhibit A, Robert Giles.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I've seen him. So?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<KALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you hear about that missing girl from Madison?

</KALE>
<ASHLEY>

(realizing; then pointing out to Giles')
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What, you think he --

</ASHLEY>
<KALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He drives a car like the one she was seen in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KALE>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Black Mustang.

<KALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	60's era Mustang.

<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gee, that really narrows it down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>

<ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
(re: binoculars)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So this is why -- you're --

Suddenly seeing something O.S., Kale RIPS the binoculars out of Ashley's hand, goes to the window.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
BINOCULAR POV - Giles pulls the Silver Toyota out of the garage and out the driveway.
</DIRECTION>

Ashley suddenly grabs the binoculars from Kale, peers out.
</DIRECTION>
<KALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey --
	</DIALOGUE>
</KALE>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So that's the infamous black mustang, huh?

</ASHLEY>
<KALE>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KALE>
<DIRECTION>
BINOCULAR POV - Sure enough, the Mustang NO LONGER HAS A BASHED-IN FENDER. The garage door starts to close --
</DIRECTION>
<KALE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How'd he fix it so fast --
	</DIALOGUE>
</KALE>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because it was never there in the first place?

</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Kale eyes Ashley. Shit, could he have imagined it? Ashley playfully grabs the binoculars back from Kale.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BINOCULAR POV - Ashley catches a glimpse of a faded TEXAS LONGHORNS BUMPER STICKER.
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)

<DIRECTION>
THEIR POV - Giles' garage door finally SLAMS CLOSED.
</DIRECTION>
<KALE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They think it might be linked to some murders in Texas two years ago.

</KALE>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Austin, Texas. Texas Longhorns.

</RONNIE>

Kale and Ronnie eye Ashley as if to say "see?" Ashley eyes them another beat -- then:
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, fine, stakeout.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(grabs binoculars)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's on my shift?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Off Kale and Ronnie, their dreams realized --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KALE'S BEDROOM - EVENING - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BOX OF SPYING CRAP is dumped onto Kale's bed. Another DV Camera, an old, bulky VHS camera, a black and white portable TV, couple of tri-pods, walkie talkies, wires... a real mess. WIDER TO REVEAL RONNIE:
</DIRECTION>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is all the stuff I could find --
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Ashley sits at Kale's computer as Kale anxiously sifts through Ronnie's stuff.
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know how long Giles has lived there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<KALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	About two or three years.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KALE>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So he could've lived in Texas...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(re: computer screen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, check this out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Ronnie goes to Ashley, reads the Amazon web page for the book:
</DIRECTION>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Murderer: Tell Tale Signs of a Serial Killer." Qualifies for free shipping if you pair it with "The Shrine of Jeffrey Dahmer."
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The summary lists four main criteria. Our guy meets at least three. White male between the age of twenty-five and fifty. He doesn't have any pets, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<KALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not that I've seen --

<ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
(nonchalant)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sexual dysfunction.

Silence. Kale and Ronnie trade awkward glances, shaking their heads to each other as if reassuring themselves they don't suffer from such a condition.
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (changing the subject)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm hungry, let's order pizza.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KALE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRACKING ACROSS KALE'S ROOM - The two tri-pod-mounted DV Cams stand watch over Giles' house. One camera feeds a grainy close-up shot of Giles' garage door to Ronnie's portable TV on the floor. The other feeds a WIDE SHOT of Giles' entire house to Kale's color TV. Both images appear on Kale's computer monitor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER TO REVEAL - Kale and Ashley sit on the floor near the window. Kale peers over to Giles with the binoculars as Ashley messes with Kale's cell phone. In the b.g. Ronnie's passed out on Kale's bed, his hand resting inside the pizza box just inches from the last slice.
</DIRECTION>
<KALE>
<DIRECTION>
(re: Giles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's been gone awhile.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KALE>
<DIRECTION>
ON ASHLEY - she's messing with Kale's cell phone.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here.

</ASHLEY>
<KALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How'd you get my phone?

</KALE>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm crafty like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<KALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What'd you do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KALE>
<DIRECTION>
Ashley carefully unclips Ronnie's cell from his hip, flips it open, dials. After a beat, Kale's cell RINGS with Madonna's "LIKE A VIRGIN." Kale laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Every time he calls, that's what you'll hear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Kale laughs as Ashley delicately re-clips the phone to Ronnie's belt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KALE'S POV - the Pilch's dog, wearing a pink sweater, suddenly darts into Kale's yard.
</DIRECTION>
<KALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KALE>
<DIRECTION>

Mr. Pilch, in his robe, suddenly appears from the shadows, watches the dog do its business.
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
(re: Mr. Pilch)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Three to one he doesn't pick it up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Nope. The dog finishes. Pilch calls it over, scoops up the dog and heads O.S.
</DIRECTION>
<KALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So that's why the grass is greener...

</KALE>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only in disturbia...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<KALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So why the move?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KALE>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean? The greener grass, the safer pastures...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<KALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, seriously.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KALE>
<DIRECTION>
There's a beat as Ashley locks eyes with Kale. Then --
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I guess my mom thought it'd help keep dad on a shorter leash. City life... had its temptations...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat; then matter of fact)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But my mom pretty much cries just as much as she always did, and dad doesn't care -- more than ever.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<KALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did they think, an extra bathroom and two-car garage would actually change things... somehow protect them and you from all that crap you can never escape?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KALE>
<DIRECTION>
Ashley holds Kale's gaze for a beat. Then, she nods, with:
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(eyeing the bracelet)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So... what're your issues, Kale?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Kale hesitates. We see in his eyes that he's flashing to the past... "going there..." There's an uneasy beat as Ashley picks up on it:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then -- HEADLIGHTS APPEAR OUTSIDE. Kale quickly turns away from Ashley, pulls one of the DV Cams off its tri-pod, flips out the three-inch LCD SCREEN.
</DIRECTION>
<KALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's him.

	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
DV CAM POV - Kale ZOOMS in on the woman's wrist and hand. Sure enough, she's wearing both a green and a purple bracelet, and has a black stamp blotch on her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<KALE>
<DIRECTION>
(over the above)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Missing girl was seen at a club. Didn't say which one though...

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't need one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
They turn back to the window, watch as Giles escorts the woman to the house, shows her in. A light comes on inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DV CAM POV - Kale ZOOMS IN on one of the living room windows, spots the woman moving around inside, looking at artwork... she sits on the sofa as Giles enters with two glasses and a bottle of wine. He sits down, pours the wine. They toast, take sips. Giles moves in for a kiss --
</DIRECTION>
<KALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's going in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KALE>

DV CAM POV - The woman shies away from Giles, stands from the sofa.

	Oh, c'mon, Giles, all she wants to do is dance.

	</DIALOGUE>
</KALE>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could be radio. See if you can find the station.

</ASHLEY>

Kale sets the camera down, turns on his receiver. As he toggles through radio stations -- Rock, Alternative...

<ASHLEY>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop.

BINOCULAR POV - Ashley watches as Giles takes the woman's hand and dances with her. Their rhythm fits the music perfectly.

</RONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Ashley and Kale eye Ronnie for a beat. Then turn back to the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DV CAM POV - Kale pans back to the woman and Giles. They're really dancing close now. Kale's and Ashley's eyes shift to each other, then quickly flick away. A beat. Then -- Ashley raises the binoculars, faces back toward Giles' with:
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now's the time to bust your move.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Ashley glances to Kale. Kale turns, holds her gaze. A palpable tension between these two. They ever so slowly lean toward each other when --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RONNIE - suddenly interrupts, pushing himself between them.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
(yawning; re: woman with Giles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's that?

Ronnie looks to Kale and Ashley who glare back.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Later.

</RONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Ronnie stands, leaves. Kale shakes his head, turns back to Ashley. They lean in again when -- Ashley's CELL PHONE ominously RINGS with the first measures of BEETHOVEN'S 5TH -- "BUM BUM BUM BUMMMMM." She pulls the cell from her pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>

</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Ashley flips the phone shut, joins Kale who's watching the LCD screen:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DV CAM POV - Giles and the woman are back on the couch. The woman is leaning her head on Giles' shoulder. As Giles leans forward to take her wine glass, the woman falls over behind him. Out cold. Kale and Ashley cringe.
</DIRECTION>

	And she's down for the count.

<KALE>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They peek back over to Giles'.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THEIR POV - We're crouched low now, so we only hear the barely audible voices of Giles and the WOMAN. Talking SERIOUSLY about something --
</DIRECTION>
<GILES>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't --
	</DIALOGUE>
</KALE>
<DIRECTION>
But Ashley keeps going.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE FOLLOW BEHIND ASHLEY - She creeps over to the fence, presses up against it, peering through the cracks --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ASHLEY'S POV - We see the dark silhouettes of Giles and the woman -- Ashley shifts her head, straining to listen --
</DIRECTION>
<GILES>

</GILES>
<DIRECTION>
ASHLEY'S POV - She sees Giles make a motion toward the fence. Suddenly, the woman's CAR KEYS WHACK the other side of the fence, then PLOP DOWN underneath it just a couple of feet from Ashley's position!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON ASHLEY - she startles, looks over, sees the keys.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ASHLEY'S POV - She looks back toward Giles and the woman. Hears the woman start to LAUGH. Giles, not laughing, purposefully steps toward the woman, takes her arm.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

(whispering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ashley, come on...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KALE>
<DIRECTION>
WITH ASHLEY - she glances down, eyes the car keys sparkling in the moonlight. She scoots toward them as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE CRANE UP TO REVEAL - Giles - heading back toward the fence!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON KALE - seeing this.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kale tries to get Ashley's attention, but she's not looking --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CU - ASHLEY'S HAND - she reaches for the car keys --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER - ASHLEY'S FINGERTIPS barely TOUCH them when --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GILES' HAND - suddenly SWOOPS IN from O.S., BRUSHES ASHLEY'S FINGERS just before grabbing the keys and swiping them back to his side!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Somehow Ashley keeps herself from screaming as she YANKS HER HAND BACK, PRESSES HERSELF AGAINST THE FENCE. She puts her hand over her mouth to silence her own breathing --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KALE'S POV - Giles stands frozen in the shadows behind Ashley.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WITH ASHLEY - She slowly turns her head, sees Giles through one of the cracks -- STANDING RIGHT THERE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ashley starts to slowly SLIIIDE away... when suddenly -- a TWIG SNAPS under her foot! Ashley FREEZES. She peers back through the nearest crack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ASHLEY'S POV - searching for Giles -- doesn't see him --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ashley presses herself even harder against the fence as we...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TILT UP AND PAN OVER TO REVEAL GILES - peering over the fence. We can only hope it's tall enough to keep him from looking down and seeing Ashley.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WITH KALE - He's seeing it all.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON GILES - He raises up, standing on his tip toes to get a better look down. Shifting his head back and forth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WITH KALE - He ducks behind the shrub, contemplating his next move. He glances down, picks up a large pebble. He pops out and tosses it over into Giles' yard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We HEAR IT DROPPING through branches, SCATTERING to the ground as Kale ducks back behind the shrub, breathing hard. He then peers back out --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS POV - Giles lowers back down, turns and heads back toward the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kale sighs in relief. Waves Ashley the "all clear." Ashley heads back over to Kale, breathless.
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
(oddly exhilarated)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was intense.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<KALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you nuts?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KALE>
<DIRECTION>
Ashley silences Kale with a finger to his lips. She then leans in, gives him a peck on the cheek and bolts away -- Off Kale, utterly stupefied --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DAD'S OFFICE - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Exhilarated, Kale SLAMS through the office door, binoculars in hand. He goes to his chair, sits, taking position...

<DIRECTION>
BINOCULAR POV - Ashley walks in, heads straight for the window and draws the blinds.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
INT. DAD'S OFFICE - NIGHT - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON ASHLEY'S WINDOW - shades still drawn. Lights are out now. The wind picks up outside as we PAN TO REVEAL Kale asleep in the leather chair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We suddenly hear GLASS SHATTER O.S.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kale's eyes POP OPEN. He looks around. Did he hear something or did he dream it -- he pulls himself out of the chair, makes his way to the door, slowly swings it open...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. 2ND FL HALL OUTSIDE DAD'S OFFICE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

INT. KALE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kale enters, tosses the binoculars on the desk, throws a glance out the window to Giles' house. Dark. Kale turns to the bed, pulls back the sheets. As Kale unties his shoes, takes off his socks, we notice over his shoulder --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE B.G. - A LIGHT COMES ON IN GILES' LIVING ROOM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON KALE - not noticing as he strips down to his boxers --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE B.G. - GILES' LIVING ROOM - THE WOMAN HEADS INTO THE ROOM FOLLOWED CLOSELY BY GILES. SHE SPINS AND SLAPS HIM IN THE FACE. SHE WALKS AWAY AS GILES STANDS THERE FROZEN.

KALE'S POV - Giles standing in the living room, glaring at the woman.
</DIRECTION>
<KALE>

</KALE>
<DIRECTION>
Kale darts to his desk, turns off the light, grabs the binoculars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BINOCULAR POV - Giles and the woman are arguing. The woman paces around the room as Giles stands there. The woman's arms flail about. As she paces back by Giles, he suddenly GRABS HER ARMS.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KALE>
<DIRECTION>
Kale watches as the woman yanks herself from his grasp and knocks over the lamp. The BULB shatters on the floor, throwing the living room into total darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kale drops the binoculars and grabs the DV CAM. He fumbles with it, flips open the LCD SCREEN. But as he presses the power button, the camera's LAMP suddenly IGNITES, MOMENTARILY LIGHTING UP KALE'S ROOM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kale spins and hits the floor. He frantically finds the switch, turns off the lamp.

DV CAM POV - Giles, now alone, has turned on another light and is simultaneously picking up pieces of shattered light
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
bulb and wiping some RED LIQUID OFF THE FLOOR... Could be wine... or blood even...

<DIRECTION>
Giles wads the towel up, picks up one of the woman's HIGH HEELS lying near the couch. Giles then moves to the stereo, turns it off, leans down, picks up the woman's OTHER SHOE. He flips off the lights, heads out of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kale trades the grainy DV CAM for the binoculars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BINOCULAR POV - Kale PANS ACROSS the lower floor windows of Giles' house that's now become eerily still. He TILTS UP to the second floor, SLOWLY PANS ACROSS those windows -- Again, nothing.

	Oh shit oh shit...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KALE>
<DIRECTION>
Kale shoves himself against the wall, frozen in terror. He doesn't dare get up. He spots his CELL PHONE -- on the floor a few feet away. He extends his leg out, uses his foot to slowly SLIIIDE the phone toward him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KALE'S TREMBLING HAND reaches for the phone, picks it up --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kale's about to flip it open when the PHONE'S LCD SCREEN SUDDENLY LIGHTS UP, BLARING MADONNA'S "LIKE A VIRGIN."
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<JULIE>

	Kale, Kale, it's me!!

Kale turns back on his side. Julie eyes him a long beat. What to say... she flips off the light, then -- pulls the door closed.

INT. ENTRY HALL - LATE THE NEXT MORNING

<DIRECTION>
Kale saunters down the stairs....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN - DAY - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kale enters, notices a few full grocery bags on the counter and the coffee maker brewing. He opens the fridge, sees a new Mountain Dew twelve-pack. He cracks open the carton, pulls out a can, closes the fridge door revealing
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GILES - IN THE FLESH, IN KALE'S KITCHEN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kale JUMPS, drops the can. It rolls to Giles' feet.

<DIRECTION>
(gesturing outside)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Behind you?

</GILES>
<DIRECTION>
Kale glares, breathing hard. Giles taps on the top of the dented soda can, hands it to Kale. Kale doesn't take it. Note: Giles' shirt should have BURNT ORANGE somewhere in it, either in the pattern, stripes, etc...
</DIRECTION>
<KALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know, how did you --

(then; favors Julie)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Must be a little difficult when the man of the house is stuck in the house.

Kale reacts to that. There's an awkward silence as Kale's eyes instinctively glance down to the ankle bracelet.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh... no, it's okay, we're managing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<DIRECTION>
Giles steps closer to Kale, bends down to get a closer look at the ankle bracelet.
</DIRECTION>
<GILES>

Kale reacts, surprised at how genuine that sounded.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay... I don't think that's the case, and --

<KALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I'd like to hear his opinion.

<JULIE>
<DIRECTION>

Julie heads out the door. Giles turns to Kale. An awkward, silent beat. Then --
</DIRECTION>
<KALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like your shirt, by the way. I mean, the color.

</KALE>
<GILES>

<GILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah? You a Longhorns fan, too?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GILES>
<KALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, absolutely. Even though I've never stepped foot in Texas --

</KALE>
<GILES>
	<DIALOGUE>

</GILES>
<KALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh.

</KALE>
<GILES>

</GILES>
<KALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a black eye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KALE>
<GILES>

	Phew, just making sure I wasn't living next to some psycho killer. Listen, I get it though. I had plenty of teachers I wanted to just... kill.

Giles quickly adjusts his tone as Julie comes back with a last bag of groceries:

	But no matter how hard it is to hold back, the high road's always the better choice.

As Giles says this, he casually sits at the kitchen table. Kale eyes him, about to turn and leave, but:

<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>

INT. KALE'S BEDROOM - DAY - LATER

<DIRECTION>
Ashley sits on the bed. She looks damned good, too. Dolled up, lipstick. She's just heard the story from Kale.
</DIRECTION>
<KALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know, he's a total freak, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KALE>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And very vague... did he genuinely mean it was nice meeting you or was he sending you a "sinister message?"
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<KALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you messing with me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KALE>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe a little. Did you even notice my hair?

</ASHLEY>
<KALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you think it's all a coincidence. We've got the car --

</KALE>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With the non dent dent --

</ASHLEY>
<KALE>

	The bumper sticker, the argument, the staring contest -- And now he's showing up in my kitchen --

<ASHLEY>

	Why, because he slashed your mom's tire?

</ASHLEY>

Ashley rolls her eyes.

</ASHLEY>
<KALE>

	Well what if she's really "not moving?" What if she's tied in the dungeon with the other girl, starving to death --

	And now the whole neighborhood's coming.

<ASHLEY>

	Look, I'm stuck here. So I figured I can either shut myself in and keep hating it or... try to make the most of it.

	Hey, I get it. You don't have to explain.

Kale looks at Ashley, realizes what she's referring to as he glances down to the ankle bracelet.

<KALE>

	Well, I appreciate the thought. Really.

Ashley glares, furious. She picks up the DV cam and binoculars, approaches Kale, hands them over with:

	Try to keep these in your drawers tonight, will ya?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>

Ashley leaves. A sullen Kale stares after her --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PRELAP - CROWD WALLA and THWUMPING MUSIC.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DAD'S OFFICE - EARLY EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kale sits in the darkness at dad's desk. He's on the phone, pressing his other finger to his ear, trying to drown out the NOISE emanating from Ashley's party next door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kale, on phone, gets Ronnie's VOICE MAIL.

<RONNIE>

	This is Ronnie, leave a message.

Kale slams the phone down, sits there a beat. JUMP CUT:

<DIRECTION>
- Kale on the phone:
</DIRECTION>
<KALE>
<DIRECTION>
(into phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I'm calling about the Jeep Cherokee that was brought in with the flat and the stripped lug -- it's ready? Listen, did they have to replace the whole tire -- they patched it? Is there any way to tell if it was slashed or -- But a nail usually acts like its own plug for awhile, doesn't it? I mean it's a really slow leak, it can't flatten a tire in twenty minutes.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat as Kale listens)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Yeah, I guess anything's possible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KALE>
<DIRECTION>
A ROAR of LAUGHTER O.S. makes Kale jump from his chair. He grabs the binoculars, heads to the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BINOCULAR POV - Kale scans the crowd until he finds Ashley, talking with a group of PARTYGOERS. She pretends to listen to one of the guy's stories as she furtively glances toward Kale's window. But it's quick. We can't be a hundred percent sure if it was on purpose.
</DIRECTION>
<KALE>

	Wait, what was that? You think I'm watching? Well, I'm not... Nope, I am minding my own business...

</KALE>
<DIRECTION>
BINOCULAR POV - Ashley excuses herself from the group and approaches the drink and food table where MINNIE TYCO (a.k.a. "Skinny Psycho") is standing, nitpicking over her snack choices. Ashley hugs her then taps the cute GUY next to her on the shoulder. The guy turns around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ashley mouths "Oh my God" like he's some long lost lover. Ashley hugs the surprised guy who wastes no time in hugging her back.

EXT. ROOF - EVENING - SECONDS LATER

Kale SLAMS a speaker down on the edge of the roof facing Ashley's. Makes sure the speaker wires are securely clamped in place, then unwinds the roll of wire back across the roof toward the ladder... JUMP CUT:

Kale runs the wire down the hall...

CU - Kale's I-POD LCD SCREEN lights up. His thumb hovers over the PLAY button.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BINOCULAR POV - Ashley's party comes into focus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kale presses play. The speaker EXPLODES with the ROAR OF BARRY MANILOW (or AIR SUPPLY).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BINOCULAR POV - Ashley's party comes to a grinding halt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kale PANS AROUND, picks up Ashley again. Glaring. Fire in her eyes as she storms O.S. Kale smiles with perverse
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
satisfaction as he tilts his head, anticipating the doorbell to ring. Another beat, then -- DING DONG.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ENTRY HALL - EVENING - SECONDS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kale descends the stairs, maintaining his wicked grin. He opens the door for Ashley, but instead -- gets PELTED WITH A BARRAGE OF WATER BALLOONS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kale stands there, frozen as the two BRATS jump from the bushes, AD LIB MOCKING Kale as they laugh and race away into the shadows. Kale's about to pursue when the sound of a DOOR OPENING O.S. stops him cold. He spins around to see
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ASHLEY

storming in from the kitchen and marching up the stairs!

Ashley storms down the hall, sees the speaker wires running into dad's office...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DAD'S OFFICE - EVENING - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ashley SLAMS through the door, spots Kale's I-pod, rips it out of its dock. The music stops. She spins around, runs smack into Kale who SWIPES the I-pod out of her hand and SLAMS it back in the dock. The music BLARES. Ashley moves in, but Kale blocks her path. She tries to get around him. He stands in her way.

<ASHLEY>

	So you were watching me. Question is for how long? Just tonight? Or maybe a week? Two weeks? Since I moved in?

</ASHLEY>

Kale tries to respond, but Ashley keeps pressing:
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the whole "my-neighbor's-the- killer" thing. Great cover --

	It's not a cover --

Over the above Ashley glances around
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what is it, Kale? Huh? What else have you seen?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<KALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What else have I seen?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KALE>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. What else?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<KALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay -- I've seen how you always pull your kleenex from the box in groups of three. Not two, not four, always three. I've seen you're the only one in the world who eats pizza- flavored Pringles. And you never stuff the chips in, you savor each one by dividing it into four precise bites. I didn't know that was even possible. You're also the first girl I've ever seen who spends more time on her roof than in her own house. And what do you do out there? You don't talk on the phone, you don't paint your nails, you read books. Now one would think with the whole numbers thing you've got going on that you'd put them on your shelf alphabetically, but you don't. Your system's much more perfect. The ones you like go on the bottom, the ones you love go in the middle, and the ones you need, the ones you keep going back to... well they go straight to the top next to the dream encyclopedia. You know what all this tells me? You know how things should be. The world according to Ashley. And guess what? It's a very entertaining and beautiful thing. Even when it takes a hit. When you end up in a place like this... when your parents dump their baggage on you, or just... when it seems like those curveballs are never gonna stop -- It sucks, but just so you know -- I get it. But I've also seen those designer window shades of yours, and guess what? They always go up the next day -- no matter what. And even if no one else has, I've noticed that. And I ain't sorry. The only thing I'll even consider apologizing for is... not dropping the binoculars and telling you this a lot sooner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KALE>
<DIRECTION>
A long beat as Ashley peers into Kale's eyes. She slowly steps closer to him:
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was either the creepiest... or the sweetest thing I've ever heard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Kale leans in and kisses her. They pull away, lock eyes. Then -- Ashley pulls Kale by his soaking wet t-shirt, kisses him back even harder. Heavy make-out. Then -- they stumble back toward the bed out of frame as we hold on Kale's window -- and Giles' house beyond...

<DIRECTION>
INT. DAD'S OFFICE - NIGHT

OUR POV - peering down into Ashley's back yard. There's a couple of guys passed out on rafts floating in the pool. WE SLOWLY PAN to reveal --

<DIRECTION>
KALE - looking tired, his eyes glazed, sitting at dad's computer surfing a website: "BRUTAL KILLINGS IN AUSTIN."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE SCREEN - As Kale clicks pages, we see FLASHES of CRIME SCENE PHOTOS from the three murders -- the bodies of the three redheads -- BLOODIED, BRUISED...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON KALE - he doesn't blink as he clicks on ONE PHOTO after the OTHER. We see a FLASHES of the victims' eyes -- WIDE OPEN, LIFELESS...

We suddenly hear laughter O.S. Kale SNAPS TO. He runs a hand through his hair, gets up, moves to the window.

Kale and Ronnie watch as Ashley shakes hands with the club girl, then throws a quick surprised glance up to Kale and Ronnie. Giles' body language tells us he's ready for Ashley to leave. Ashley gets the hint, shakes his hand, heads back down the driveway and out of sight.

Kale raises the binoculars again, then furiously grabs for his pad and pencil.
</DIRECTION>

Kale's starting to get manic:
</DIRECTION>
<KALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Yeah, he seemed like such a normal guy. Sure he kept to himself, but he was always nice to me." That's what they all say. That's what all the neighbors always say -- after the fact. Only after they've caught the guy, after he's killed thirty people --

Ashley and Ronnie trade concerned looks.

	Kale, why are you so --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Ashley and Ronnie stop in their tracks at the MESS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Note: Up till now, the office has been in reasonably good order. But now, it's noticeably different.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER - The shades are drawn. Soda cans everywhere... papers are spread on the floor: PRINTED OUT FULL COLOR GRUESOME CRIME SCENE PHOTOS, BLACK & WHITE AUTOPSY PHOTOS of the
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
murdered redheads... more pictures of the girl who disappeared, PATRICIA WALSH. "MISSING" FLYERS...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Over the above, Ronnie leans down, lifts a couple of books out of an Amazon.com box: "Murderer: Tell Tale Signs of a Serial Killer" and "The Shrine of Jeffrey Dahmer" -- the titles Ashley was referencing earlier. Ronnie shows them to Ashley who takes a RECEIPT out of a nearby Home Depot box -- on the page -- SMITH'S UNIVERSAL GARAGE DOOR REMOTE QTY (1) $29.99.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ashley and Ronnie turn to Kale. They notice on the wall behind him, hanging next to his Dad's book cover posters, a BLACK AND WHITE POSTER-SIZE SATELLITE PHOTO of THE NEIGHBORHOOD. Giles' house is circled and labeled in flourescent ink. Kale finally looks up, notices them looking --
</DIRECTION>
<KALE>
<DIRECTION>
(re: satellite poster)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ronnie, you've seen this satellite website, right? You can find any location on earth and take a picture --

</ASHLEY>
<KALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's it look like?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KALE>
<ASHLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like you're determined to turn Giles in to who you think he is.

</ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
That gets Kale's attention.
</DIRECTION>
<ASHLEY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Because you lost him before maybe... you ever really knew him. Before the world according to Kale took a hit from that same stuff you were telling me about, remember? All those curveballs? But it's like -- it's like you're still trying to dodge them by forcing pieces together that are never gonna fit... by getting all wrapped up in...

(re: mess)

	<DIALOGUE>
	This.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Obsessing's not gonna "protect you," Kale. It's not gonna make the hurt go away.

Kale locks eyes with Ashley. A long beat, then --
</DIRECTION>
<KALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you two gonna help me or not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KALE>
<DIRECTION>
Ashley pauses, shocked she hasn't gotten through to Kale. Then --

	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure.

</KALE>
<DIRECTION>
Ronnie leaves. Kale sits in silence, his thoughts unreadable -- JUMP CUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kale falls back in the leather chair, fighting his emotions, trying to keep them in check. He glances out to Ashley's. Dark. He peers around the office -- the articles, the books, his DAD'S PHOTOS... the family portrait of Dad, Mom, and Kale, smiling wide... their lives ahead of them...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KALE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the darkness, find Kale sitting in his video game chair staring out at Giles' house.

HIS POV - Giles' garage door is open. Giles' silver Toyota is parked inside next to the Mustang. There's a light or two on inside Giles' house but no signs of movement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kale throws intermittent glances out the window as he starts to UNSCREW the back of the DV CAM. He lifts the back off, then reaches in a nearby BOX and pulls out a BLUE TOOTH WIRELESS CIRCUIT BOARD. He starts connecting it inside the camera... JUMP CUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kale screws the back of the camera on, takes a swig of a soda. There's suddenly fierce KNOCKING at Kale's front door. Kale just sits there. Staring ahead. More knocking and DOORBELL RINGING. Kale jumps from his chair, grabs the bat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ENTRY HALL - NIGHT - SECONDS LATER

Kale swings the door open -- nobody's there -- then -- Ronnie suddenly STEPS INTO FRAME, grabs Kale --

Then -- the camera seems to fall, SLIDING ON THE HARDWOOD FLOOR TOWARD AN OLD BOOKCASE...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE IMAGE CUTS OUT -- GOES TO ALL SNOW --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kale jumps up, pacing. Peers out the window to Giles'. No telling what the hell's happening -- or happened -- in there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kale eyes his ankle bracelet. Green light. Kale eyes his bat. Grabs it. Fuck it.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. KALE'S BACK YARD - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

Kale SLAMS out the back door, races across the yard, skips over his kite string boundary --

The house is still. Kale bolts around the side, uneasily feeling his way through shadows and low-hanging branches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GILES' FRONT YARD - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's even darker on this side. No lights on in Giles' house. Kale cautiously rounds the side, approaches the front door -- it's open a few inches -- darkness beyond.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kale eyes it a beat. Then -- steps up onto the porch, about to push it open when -- SIRENS BLARE O.S.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kale SPINS AROUND to see A POLICE CRUISER ROLLING TO A STOP. Kale races toward it as two uniformed officers step out --

<KALE>

</KALE>

Uniform #2 knocks on the door. Rings the bell. No answer. Uniform #2's about to knock again when a light comes on inside. After a beat -- Giles opens the door. Looking disheveled, in his bathrobe.
</DIRECTION>
<GILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, yes, can I help you, officer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GILES>
<UNIFORM_2>

<UNIFORM_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, calm down --
	</DIALOGUE>
</UNIFORM_1>
<KALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, but he's lying -- he has my friend, and he kidnapped that girl last week, he killed maybe three others, all redheads, they could be in a bag -- a big blue plastic bag -- in his garage -- my friend knew this --

Uniform #3 nods as Uniform #1 heads back up to Giles and Uniform #2.
</DIRECTION>

KALE'S POV - Uniform #1 whispers something to Uniform #2. They turn back to Giles.
</DIRECTION>
<UNIFORM_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, do you mind if we take a look inside?
	</DIALOGUE>
</UNIFORM_2>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. A couple more police cruisers roll to a stop. Curious NEIGHBORS are now gathering across the street.
</DIRECTION>
<GILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Absolutely, be my guest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GILES>
<DIRECTION>
Giles ushers them through the door and follows them into the house. Giles turns, shoots a quick glance to Kale before closing the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON KALE - all he can do is wait. He shifts his gaze to the gathering neighbors. A few lock eyes with him, shake their heads. Kale turns back toward the house...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIME CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GILES' BACK YARD - GARAGE - NIGHT - SHORT TIME LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE GARAGE DOOR - as it slowly raises up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER - The uniforms, standing with Kale, wait as the door opens all the way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A light comes on inside. Giles and Uniform #1 come out the inner garage door as Uniform #2 Giles drags the BLUE BAG out from the garage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sure enough, there's blood smears and visible strands of matted hair near the top. Uniform #2 unties the bag, pulls the sides away. Everyone gathers around, peers inside, then suddenly yank themselves back at the horrible STENCH emanating from within.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kale eyes Uniform #1 who gestures him to look. Kale steps toward the bag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KALE'S POV - We peer into the bag to reveal the WIDE OPEN eyes of a dead -- DEER.
</DIRECTION>
<GILES>
<DIRECTION>
(to the cops)

	<DIALOGUE>
	I hit it the other night. Thought I'd save a few steps and get it off the road myself. I was gonna bury it sooner, but it's been a helluva week --

	So why'd you have to have the car fixed in record time, huh? Because it was covered in her blood --

As the Uniforms lead Kale back down the driveway...
</DIRECTION>
<KALE>

(quietly; drained)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So where's my friend, then? Can anyone tell me that? Does anyone believe me?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KALE>
<DIRECTION>
Kale looks over, sees PARKER, standing with JULIE whose eyes are filled with it all: anger, concern, sadness...
</DIRECTION>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kale, come on --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<DIRECTION>
Kale turns back to Giles' house. Sees lights being turned out inside. As Kale shifts his gaze forward, he locks eyes with ASHLEY standing in the crowd of neighbors. She watches him with concern. Kale turns away, drops his head as the cops, Parker and Julie lead him away... a FLASH OF LIGHTNING in the distance...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kale sits on the sofa, staring off. He looks to the stairs as Julie and Parker head down. Parker nods to Uniform #3 who's standing next to Kale. Uniform #3 meets Parker and Julie at the front door. Julie quietly nods to them, opens the door. A few more inaudible words are exchanged before Julie gently closes the door behind them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Julie heads back into the living room, sits across from Kale.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat; then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, Kale.

Not the words Kale expected. He looks up --

<DIRECTION>
(then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I feel like I let you down. I was too caught up in my own grief to see straight. I thought time would heal this and taking a second job was... the answer to keeping a roof over our heads --

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's just wood. Do you hear me? We're still not through this -- obviously -- it's gonna take more time -- maybe a lot more time -- and that's just gotta be okay, because I know -- it'll get better.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want us to be us again. I want us to be honest with each other like we used to be. Is that possible?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<KALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. I just -- didn't think you'd believe me --
	</DIALOGUE>
</KALE>
<JULIE>

	Listen to me. I am always on your side. No matter what. It may not look like it sometimes, but it's the truth. And we'll get through this. Okay?

</JULIE>
<DIRECTION>
Kale nods. He stands, goes to Julie and hugs her -- tight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KALE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kale enters amidst a few more LIGHTNING FLASHES and distant ROLLS OF THUNDER. He heads to his window, glances out at Giles' house. Dark. The wind's picking up. Kale closes his window, draws the shade, sticks his cell in the charger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He collapses to the bed, stares at the roof over his head for a beat -- then "LIKE A VIRGIN" suddenly BLARES ON HIS CELL PHONE. Kale stares at it... then jumps from his bed, races to the phone, rips it from the charger, flips it open --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE PHONE'S LCD SCREEN - A text message: LOOK AT YOUR SCREEN. The LCD SCREEN suddenly BLACKS OUT. The battery's dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A wide eyed Kale puts the cell phone on his desk, slowly shifts his gaze to his computer monitor -- a grainy image suddenly pops on -- shaky at first -- then it finally steadies, and clears up. A torso and face come into focus: RONNIE, lying in the corner of a very enclosed space. Eyes open, head tilted against the wall. Dead.
</DIRECTION>
<KALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OH MY GOD --
	</DIALOGUE>
</KALE>
<DIRECTION>
Nearly hyperventilating, Kale leans closer to the screen, sees a pile of clothes and a stray racketball trophy lying next to Ronnie.
</DIRECTION>
<KALE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit --
	</DIALOGUE>
</KALE>
<DIRECTION>
Kale realizes -- Ronnie's IN HIS CLOSET. Kale slowly turns, eyes his closet door. He then steps toward it, reaches out -- and SLIDES THE CLOSET DOOR OPEN TO REVEAL --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RONNIE - lying dead in the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<KALE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

Kale kneels down to Ronnie who suddenly POPS BACK TO LIFE!
</DIRECTION>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	BOO!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Kale screams, falls back to the floor as Ronnie cracks up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MORE LIGHTNING FLASHES and THUNDER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kale staggers to his feet. Stunned. Not knowing whether to hug Ronnie or beat the shit out of him.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNIE>

</RONNIE>
<KALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Still, you could have --
	</DIALOGUE>
</KALE>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What, popped out and said, "oh yeah, officers, my friend's right, I was just in that house, I'd gone to get my cell phone out of the guy's car I broke into earlier..." Are you kidding me?

</RONNIE>
<KALE>

Kale paces around, runs a hand through his hair as Ronnie steps out of the closet, DV CAM in hand.

<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dude, I am sorry. Can we just... hug it out?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<KALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why didn't Giles tell the cops someone broke in? I mean, he did see you, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KALE>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, let's be positive for a change. I thought he did, but maybe he didn't. Or maybe he's a nice guy afterall, and he didn't wanna make a big deal of it, you know? I mean, he's a guy, he was a kid once...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Kale eyes Ronnie.
</DIRECTION>
<KALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if he wasn't always a guy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KALE>
<DIRECTION>
Ronnie eyes Kale for a beat, wondering if he's serious. Then Kale cracks a smile. Ronnie cracks up.

	But I do have to ask... what was in the bag?

Kale gets up, heads to the camera. About to eject the tape, when a thought stops him. He pulls the camera off the TV, sits on the floor, presses "PLAY", scans back through the tape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE TV - The same footage. Nothing glaring stands out. The camera falls from Ronnie's hand, slides to the bookcase. Ronnie quickly scoops the camera up, keeps running...

Kale scans back again.

ON THE TV - just as the camera slides to a stop at the bookcase and aims underneath it, Kale FREEZES THE IMAGE. Dark, grainy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kale grabs his remote, cranks the brightness all the way up on his TV.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kale scoots closer to the TV amidst another FLASH OF LIGHTNING & MUCH LOUDER CLAP OF THUNDER.

<DIRECTION>
ON HIS FINGER - pressing the FRAME BY FRAME ADVANCE button --

ON THE TV -- we start to see SOMETHING UNDER THE BOOKCASE...

Kale presses the button a couple more times.

Kale's eyes widen as he keeps pressing the ADVANCE BUTTON...

THE FACE OF THE MISSING GIRL -- PATRICIA WALSH -- POPS ON THE SCREEN IN SHARP FOCUS, HER LONG RED HAIR PARTIALLY COVERING HER GHOSTLY, WIDE OPEN EYES THAT STARE RIGHT INTO CAMERA!

No answer. Shit. Kale grabs the cordless off his bed, clicks it on: DEAD. Another lightning FLASH. He grabs the tape out of the camera, buries it in his closet, pulls out his racketball trophy then creeps to the door, peers out --

Kale spins around as

EXT. KALE'S BACK YARD - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>

Kale bolts out the door, but trips on a well-placed garden gnome on the steps. Giles or the brats must have put it there. Regardless, it slows Kale down. He staggers into the yard, SCREAMING for anyone to hear. But the WIND and THUNDER drown him out as

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GILES' HAND suddenly grab's KALE'S ANKLE just as the ANKLE BRACELET is about to cross the line.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kale screams, digs his hands into the earth, trying to pull himself forward, but Giles is too strong. He DRAGS Kale backward, then PINS him to the ground, pulls out a roll of duct tape, quickly and efficiently wraps some around Kale's mouth, hands and ankles.
</DIRECTION>

Giles yanks Kale up, throws him over his shoulder and heads back toward Kale's house.

	What's wrong? Hey, you're the one who couldn't leave me alone. Truthfully, I'm sick of covering my tracks. You think I like spending my spare time looking over my shoulder for people like you? Word of advice, if you ever need to hurt someone, think everything through. Because you do get a taste for it, don't you? But damned if people aren't just waiting to stand in your way... cops, reporters, determined relatives, nosy fucking neighbors... next thing you know, you're on tilt, you can't think straight, you're clocking your teacher in front of the whole class, me... I'm hitting a damned deer... Man, that was some shitty luck.
	</DIALOGUE>

(then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyway, it's pretty clear how we've gotta clean this up. The irony is, you've done all the hard stuff. Whaddaya think: "Troubled youth finally snapped." Maybe because he was jealous of his girlfriend, or maybe he just couldn't deal with the guilt from not saving daddy.

Giles steps away, turns back to the bed as Kale suddenly does SNAP. He leans forward, grabs the LCD computer monitor with his taped wrists, stands, whirls around, and HURLS it at GILES, SMACKING HIM on the side of his head -- a one in a hundred shot! Giles goes down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But the forward momentum of Kale's throw combined with his taped ankles causes him to lose his balance. Kale falls to the floor, scrambles for the BASEBALL BAT just inches away --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GILES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
staggers to his feet and charges Kale. Kale grabs the bat, rolls around and swings up at Giles, WHACKING HIM IN THE CHEST. Giles doubles over as Kale frantically plants the bat on the floor, using it as a "cane" to pull himself back to his feet. He HOPS toward Giles, raises the bat, swings it, but Giles anticipates, grabs the bat, pulls it forward, and REVERSE JABS KALE in the face! Kale staggers back, but somehow keeps his balance and the bat. He spins around, hops to the door into...

He drops her to the floor. Ashley scrambles for Kale, helps him to his feet, pulls Kale back down the hall to...

Ashley shoves Kale inside as she spins back, SLAMS the office door in Giles' face, locks it. Giles BANGS on the door.

Ashley goes to Kale, RIPS the duct tape off his mouth. Kale SCREAMS in PAIN as Ashley heads for the desk phone.

	<DIALOGUE>

</KALE>
<DIRECTION>
Ashley and Kale glance around for weapons. Ashley pockets the scissors, grabs a letter opener off dad's desk. Kale finds his racketball racket and the ball. Pockets the ball, slips the racket in the back of his shorts, then grabs the baseball bat as he heads for the bookshelves near the door that leads to the outside porch. He reaches up, runs his fingers to the third book on the middle shelf, pulls it out, flips it open to reveal a KEY that drops in his hand.

EXT. 2ND FL PORCH - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Kale raises the bat, swings it at the 2nd floor hallway window that separates the interior of the house from the porch. The window SHATTERS. Kale tosses the bat back to Ashley.

There's a lull in the thunder. All becomes eerily quiet for a beat as Kale waits for Giles to appear at the window. He glances back at Ashley who ducks behind the wall inside dad's office -- she glances to the office door. No more BANGING. She shrugs to Kale: "where is he?"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another beat, then suddenly -- a FLASH OF LIGHTNING reveals

Ashley charges out onto the porch with the bat. Swings it at Giles who promptly RIPS it from her hand and hurls it off the porch. Ashley whips out the letter opener, spins around, about to stab Giles, but he backhands her. Ashley falls, SMACKS her head on the porch railing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She drops to the floor, half conscious as Giles picks up the letter opener, turns his attention back to the 2nd floor hallway window --

Kale reaches the top of the ladder, steps onto the roof, but Giles, from below, HEAVES THE LADDER UPWARD, tripping Kale. Kale SLAMS down on the roof, smacks the back of his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KALE'S BLURRY POV - against a fury of lightning flashes, Giles races up the ladder and steps onto the roof. Stalks toward Kale.
</DIRECTION>

Kale gets to his feet, draws the racketball racket from his shorts, takes out the ball, assumes a professional looking serving position and WHAM! Kale beams the ball at Giles -- and misses completely.
</DIRECTION>
<KALE>

	That was a warning!

</KALE>

Giles rushes Kale who wails on him with the racket. Giles ducks, spins around, brings his fist up and punches Kale in the chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kale drops the racket. It slides away down the roof as Kale doubles over. But Giles grabs Kale before he can fall. He pulls Kale up off his feet, pulls him closer, gets in his face. Kale summons some strength, tilts his head up and HEADBUTTS GILES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Giles stumbles back, pulling Kale with him. Giles SLAMS down on the roof. He and Kale roll down the incline and stop just short of the edge --

Kale looks over, spots his STEREO SPEAKER a few feet away.

<DIRECTION>
WITH KALE - he gets to his feet, heads back up the roof as Giles suddenly whips out the letter opener and hurls it like a THROWING KNIFE at Kale.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The letter opener embeds itself in the back of Kale's thigh. Kale screams, falls to his knees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CU - Kale cringes from the pain as Giles, now right behind him, wraps the SPEAKER WIRE around Kale's NECK and pulls. Kale grabs for it as Giles chokes the life out of him. Kale only has one chance. He reaches behind his leg, grabs the embedded letter opener, RIPS it away, twirls it in his hand and shoves it back into Giles' stomach!

Giles recoils as Kale flings himself away from the choke- hold, falls back to the roof, rolls down and PLUMMETS to --

KALE'S POV - Giles stands on the upper roof, smiles as he brings up the letter opener.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kale's eyes widen. He pulls himself to his feet, and sidearms the racket up at Giles. The racket spins through the air like a boomerang and miraculously smacks Giles in the hand, knocking the letter opener away!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WITH KALE - he whirls around, races toward the edge of the roof... and JUMPS.

The kitchen door slowly pushes open. After a beat, Kale quietly steps in, heavily armed with a swimming pool LEAF- SKIMMING NET.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another FLASH OF LIGHTNING illuminates the kitchen. Kale cautiously rounds the island, glances down: Ronnie's gone. He glances to the block of butcher knives -- empty.

Kale grabs a couple of table knives from the kitchen drawer, opts to keep the leaf-skimming net as he makes his way out of the kitchen and into...

Kale stumbles back inside the door, tries to SLAM it closed, but Giles overpowers Kale, shoves the door open, knocking Kale to the floor. The butcher knife slides away under a table.

Giles enters, kicks Parker's body out of the way and closes the door. He steps toward Kale as Ashley, from O.S. suddenly drops the LEAF-SKIMMING NET OVER HIS HEAD and furiously YANKS Giles back to the floor!
