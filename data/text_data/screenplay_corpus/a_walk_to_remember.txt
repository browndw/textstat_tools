Landon looks urban, prosperous, well-groomed -- but retains his boyish whimsy and sense of irony. A cell phone and overnight bag on the seat next to him.

EXT. BEAUFORT HIGH GYM - NIGHT (NOVEMBER, 1985)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROCK MUSIC drifts out open doors -- barely recognizable as "Born in the U.S.A." Students hang. Brains, preps, richies, heavy metals, jocks, punk rockers, goths, geeks. Mixing without mixing. Most are red-eyed, woozy, wasted. A couple of boys break dance to a BOOM BOX.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Missing are the criminals...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A shiny T-top CAMARO ROARS up. Stops, TIRES SQUEALING. VAN HALEN BLASTING. LANDON, 18, at the wheel. He is impulsive, sexy-troubled, with the nothing-to-lose courage to act on destructive whims. He is envied, copied, feared.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAMARO

EMPTIES roll and CLINK on the floor. A tiny plastic skeleton dances as it hangs from the rearview mirror. Landon stamps a joint into the ashtray.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. DUMPSTER
</DIRECTION>

CLAY, obese, wearing a too-small student monitor vest, is dumping garbage from a trash can. A loud HONK. Clay turns to see the Camaro, then turns back to the school, coast clear. He quickly heaves in the empty trash can as the Camaro pulls up.

Eric pushes a door open. Empties fall from the back seat. Clay climbs in.

Landon inches the car forward, teasing Clay, teasing Kelly.

EXT. GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Landon lifts the garage DOOR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LANDON'S POV - INSIDE GARAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A murky place. Filled with old tools and junk and a grim old bike.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MINI-MALL - AUTO PARTS SHOP - LITTLE LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Landon comes out the glass door, his arms loaded, sees his bike. No way to carry. He looks around. The bus stop. A bus approaching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. UNDER CAMARO - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BANGING, RATCHETING, CLINKING. Landon's working hard. A BOOM BOX playing SIMPLE MINDS' "Alive and Kicking."
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>

</CYNTHIA>
<DIRECTION>
He pauses, annoyed, then rolls himself out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CARTER DRIVEWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The mangled front bumper's on the ground. Cynthia stands there in her bathrobe. Upset. Landon's almost too much.
</DIRECTION>
<CYNTHIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not hanging round here all day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYNTHIA>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not hanging. I'm fixing my car --
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<CYNTHIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't need a car you can't drive for a month. Go see Marvin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYNTHIA>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Bout what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<CYNTHIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	About a job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYNTHIA>

Landon ignores her. Slides back under his car.

<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's going to try you as assistant manager.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	You could be manager someday.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYNTHIA>
<DIRECTION>
Landon can't believe this.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DRIVEWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Landon slides back out.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not working there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
Cynthia sets her jaw. He knows that look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RESTAURANT - KITCHEN - LUNCH HOUR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Landon is sweating, scouring pots. A crooked cap on his head, an assistant manager name tag on his shirt. He's making some headway; only two more to wash.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARVIN, the owner, walks over. Beer belly, greasy hair. Dumps another pile of dirty pots and pans in Landon's sink. Landon glimpses his future.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PRINCIPAL KELLY'S OUTER OFFICE - EARLY AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Landon paces, jumpy. Kelly's secretary, MISS TARBOX, quietly locks her purse in her bottom drawer.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's he in with?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<MISS_TARBOX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He'll be with you when he's available.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MISS_TARBOX>
<DIRECTION>
The door to Kelly's office opens. Jamie Sullivan exits with her father, the tall stern REVEREND HEGBERT SULLIVAN. Jamie eyes Landon as she passes by.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
(joking)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You expelled, too?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
Nobody laughs or even smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PRINCIPAL KELLY'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Kelly makes a note in Jamie's file.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Finding the real world to your liking, Mr. Carter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_KELLY>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to come back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<MR_KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
(looking up, surprised)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Back? Were you ever really here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
They both know Kelly has the upper hand. Kelly leans back in his chair, relishing it.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
(mumbling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to graduate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly studies Landon, the boy who can't get out of his own way.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
(thinking aloud)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You could grace our hallowed halls again, if, while you're here, you make a sincere effort to be part of our little school community --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_KELLY>
<LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
(relieved)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd do that --
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<MR_KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How would you do that, Mr. Carter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Landon shrugs, clueless.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shall I give you a few ideas?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_KELLY>
<LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling, too)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<MR_KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Besides attending all your regular classes, I'd like you to help our janitorial staff after school --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_KELLY>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For pay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<MR_KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For the inner satisfaction it will bring.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Saturday mornings, I'd like you to tutor disadvantaged students at our sister school --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_KELLY>
<LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
(joking)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm as underprivileged as they are --
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<MR_KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The fact that you attend this school makes you privileged.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
His tone quiets Landon.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Finally, I'd like you to join the drama club. Rehearsals are Tuesday and Thursday evenings.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_KELLY>
<LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
(grumbling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd work backstage or something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<MR_KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or something. They're doing a play for the holidays.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_KELLY>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When do I get time for me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<MR_KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't. That's the point.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Landon's not happy, but he'll work with this. As he heads for the door:
</DIRECTION>
<MR_KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
(softer, trying to reach him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Landon, none of us faculty see you the way you see yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some of us remember how your father --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_KELLY>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then you remember more than I do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON BROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
pushing gum wrappers under a radiator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SCIENCE CLASSROOM - AFTER SCHOOL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Landon sweeps at the floor during the Star Club open house. A dozen nerds, including Jamie Sullivan (wearing her brown sweater), stand at astronomy exhibits. Students wander in, listen, look.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
(answering question)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Saturn's 15 degrees to the right of red Antares and much brighter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
To her small audience, she holds up a contraption made from a wire coat hanger.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is a very simple device made from a coat hanger, plastic wrap and typewriter correction fluid. Does anyone know what it is?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
No one does.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
(barely audible)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A star frame.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
But Jamie hears. She regards him a moment, then keeps going.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is a star frame.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
Clay and Eric enter, checking on Landon, glancing at Jamie.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A star frame will help you locate stars and planets with your naked eye --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
(scoffing, setting her up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Did God create the sun?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
(taking him seriously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, God created the universe and all its physical laws. Even Einstein said it's a miracle that our world is comprehensible --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- If God can do all that, why can't he get you a new sweater?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>
<DIRECTION>
Landon laughs loudly. Members of the club look at him.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was a joke. Laugh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
Jamie smiles. She can laugh at herself. And she finds Landon funny.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CARTER KITCHEN - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Landon washes up while his mother sets the table. The MICROWAVE HUMS in the b.g.
</DIRECTION>
<CYNTHIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your father dropped off an extra check.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYNTHIA>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want his money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<CYNTHIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It could help with a new car --
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYNTHIA>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- I like the car I have.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
He picks up the envelope with wet hands. Without looking inside, rips it in half. Cynthia smiles, quietly happy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SCHOOL BUS - TRAVELING - SATURDAY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Enthusiastic preppies, richies, other do-gooders, singing "Karma Chameleon." Jamie sits in an aisle seat, reading, not singing. She turns around to look at Landon. He rides in the back row, staring out the window, wearing a Sony Walkman, glum.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
To Z.Z. TOP'S "Sleeping Bag." Out the window -- Jefferson High School coming into view. Bars on every window, chain-link fence around the parameter, no grass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JEFFERSON HIGH - LIBRARY - LITTLE LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A big room with tables and chairs but few books. Pairs of heads are bent over textbooks and notebooks. Landon sits with LUIS, a freshman boy of mixed ethnicity. A geometry text between them.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
(reading)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- 'So what is the measure of angle x if A and B are similar triangles?'
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
Luis is lost, intimidated.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Know what 'similar' means?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
Luis shrugs. Luis looks down at the book as if for the answer, then at Landon, hopeless. He gets up and walks off. Landon looks up in disbelief and catches Jamie studying him. She's at a nearby table with her student, ISABEL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SCHOOL BUS - NOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The DOOR SWISHES SHUT behind Landon as he hops aboard. He's late and heads for the rear bench seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LANDON'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jamie sitting there. And no vacant seats save next to her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bus begins to roll. Landon lurches forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRAVELING - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bus is moving through Beaufort. Landon sits next to Jamie. Putting a new tape into his Sony Walkman. His body turned away. She's reading her book.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You going to visit Harold?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
Landon scowls. What-who is she talking about?
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They let him out of the hospital yesterday. He's in a rest home on Oak Street.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
That old man.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He goes to my father's church. He could've died --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- This your idea of small talk?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't make small talk --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Obviously.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just wanted to tell you not to give up. Sometimes you've got to back into the teaching from somewhere else.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
If he heard her, he makes no sign. She goes back to her book. A long beat, then:
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What makes you volunteer?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Want to know why I tutor reading?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
Not really.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because, growing up, books were my world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
(mean)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Were?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't know me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your book and your brown sweater and your hair. What's more to know -- ?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- I wear the sweater because I'm cold. I read because no one talks to me. My hair is my hair. What is it exactly that's bothering you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't care what people say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean care what you say? I'm worrying about other things.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like what? The moons of Jupiter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't you have a normal conversation?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want to have any conversation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good, cuz talking to you is like trying to explain red to a blind person.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
She reads again. The bus pulls to a stop in front of Beaufort High. Belinda, wearing a neck brace, is waiting, leaning on her Cabriolet. Jamie watches Landon exit the bus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAMIE'S POV - OUT THE WINDOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Landon greeting Belinda, kissing her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - TUESDAY EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Landon opens a side door, peers in at the Drama Club.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LANDON'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A big space with a stage. MS. GARBER stands before six geeky boys, and a dozen fat girls and Jamie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Landon reacts -- this girl actually chooses to be in these places? Ms. Garber looks up from her papers.
</DIRECTION>
<MS_GARBER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're waiting, Mr. Carter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MS_GARBER>
<DIRECTION>
He slides in a row behind the others. Leans forward and pokes a boy, EDDIE JONES. Eddie's pimply and talks with his eyes squinched up.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the play?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie hands him a photocopied script, The Rainmaker.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The-the-there's this drought an' -- and a smooth t-t-alking guy comes and says he can m-make rain --
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- And the ugly farmer's daughter falls for him. I saw the movie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. It's really g-g-good --
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- It blows.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
ON STAGE - MINUTES LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jamie and Landon sit in folding chairs, reading from scripts. Landon's wooden, showing how lame this is.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'I hope your dreams come true.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>

	'They won't.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
(as Starbuck)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Believe in yourself and they will. Let me ask you, Lizzie. Look in the mirror? Are you pretty --?'
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<MS_GARBER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Landon, are you trying to be bad at this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MS_GARBER>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it just comes naturally.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
Jamie smiles. Garber taps her script -- continue.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
(as Starbuck)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'It's got to be inside you. Then one day the mirror will be the eyes of the man who loves you. You'll look in that mirror and you'll be more than pretty. You'll be beautiful.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>

Ms. Garber eyes Landon, motions for him to keep going.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
(as Starbuck)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Look at me. Tell me what you see!'
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
As Lizzie, Jamie looks into his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
(as Lizzie)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Is it really me?'
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
(as Starbuck, hamming)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Yes. You're-you're b-b- beautiful.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
Hoots and laughter. Jamie looks away, humiliated.
</DIRECTION>
<MS_GARBER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quiet!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(announcing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Landon will play the role of Bill Starbuck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MS_GARBER>
<DIRECTION>
Groans among the boys. Jamie is horrified. So is Landon.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
(to Garber)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No way. No thanks. I can't do it --
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<MR_KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) (offstage)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- You can and you will, Mr. Carter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly's been standing in the wings.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
(warning)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With all the sincerity and dignity you can muster.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone stares at Landon. He's trapped.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. AUDITORIUM - LATER THAT EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Raining. Landon exits behind all the others. Stands under an overhang, lights a cigarette, angry, waiting for a ride. Jamie approaches, something on her mind.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
(rude)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're like this fly, buzzing buzzing everywhere --
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- This play means a lot to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
(snorting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This play -- ?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- I know you don't suck at acting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
Landon laughs. Refusing to take her seriously. Behind him, the lights go out as the school closes for the night.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you have to make it a big joke because only dorks and dweebies like doing theater --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- What are you going on about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
Pause.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can judge too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
He exhales, eyeing her, daring her.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't care about classes or graduating. But you like school because you're popular and you know you'll never be on top again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's deep --
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Your act only works with an audience.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My act?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
She walks off toward her father's old Pontiac. The last car in the parking lot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fire trucks rush by on the street below. Landon's ears twitch. He looks about. No one, no ride. He sees the Pontiac backing out of a parking spot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Landon bangs on the side of her car as she drives past.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A ride?! Please!

</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PONTIAC
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jamie turns to look at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAMIE'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Landon, wet, desperate, his eyes pleading.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
(insincere)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can talk about your helping me with my lines.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OLD PONTIAC - TRAVELING - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jamie's at the wheel.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know you don't want help.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then we both know.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll point. You drive. Faster.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
He points the way, to the taillights of the fire trucks. The wet road glistens.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're following fire trucks?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
(duh)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because that's where the fire is?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
He fishes in his pocket for a tape. Pulls one out. He's searching the dash -- no cassette player.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fire is like a living thing. Wild. Unpredictable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Not like you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
She jerks the car across the center lane. Driving on the wrong side of the road. He grips the dash.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the -- ?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you agree you need help?

LANDON'S POV - OUT WINDSHIELD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Headlights looming, a car coming. Closer and closer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
She swings the Pontiac back to the right lane. Smiling. A car zips by in the other direction, HORN BLARING.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
Landon drops his attitude, his act. He toys with the glove compartment knob.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Kelly'll make me leave school if I screw up the play.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
(to herself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	28 and 42.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
Pause. He acts like he doesn't hear, but he's interested.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's with the friggin numbers?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	28 is do something illegal. 42 is befriend an enemy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm an enemy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kinda. Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ACROSS STREET FROM FIRE - LITTLE LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Landon and Jamie walk around the fire, watching the fire and the firemen. Landon is just tolerating her.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The reason I got the part... I'm a little like Lizzie. Except I don't worry about some man rescuing me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
If she's offended, she keeps it to herself.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got some kind of list?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you asking to mock me or do you really want to know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe a little of both.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
They both smile.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll take a chance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go for it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's like a to-do list, but for my life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
He smirks.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you can't imagine the future, you won't have one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
He lights a cigarette. She reaches for it.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
(joking)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Having a cigarette. 100.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
She grins and takes a drag. They share the cigarette.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what else is on this list?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's private.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
(cajoling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to tell me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
She eyes him, not certain she's willing to risk sharing her dreams with him.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
(guessing, rudely)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get very wasted. Lose your virginity --
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
(correcting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Spend a year in the Peace Corps. Make a medical discovery --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
(contemptuous)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ambitious.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Being negative's a lot more work than being positive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like you'd know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do know.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be two places at once... learn to hit a baseball or turn a cartwheel... eat breakfast with chopsticks...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
He likes the frivolity of these.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's... Number one?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
She looks away, embarrassed.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
(changing subject)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you want help with your lines, I have two conditions.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have to promise not to fall in love with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
He's certain she's joking.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No problem --
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you have to meet my father.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at her like she's crazy to worry about this.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fathers love me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON PARSONAGE FRONT DOOR
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARSONAGE PORCH - WIDER - NEXT EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Landon gives a cheery little wave. He's very sweaty. His bike teeters on its kickstand in the b.g.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. Landon Carter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
Landon offers his hand. The Reverend shakes reluctantly, eyeing him closely: Landon's Army boots, torn jeans, dirty t-shirt, aloof manner.
</DIRECTION>
<REV_SULLIVAN>
<DIRECTION>
(surprised)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're in the play?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REV_SULLIVAN>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lead man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
Jamie slides out the door. She looks good in jeans and a white t-shirt. Almost normal. In the b.g., Landon's BIKE CRASHES over. He bounds down the porch steps.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
(explaining bike)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They took my license for 30 days. But nobody's pressing charges.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
The Reverend looks at Jamie, concerned. Landon tries the kickstand, then leans the bike against a carefully trimmed bush. Not the best place.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll get something for us to drink --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't bother!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
But she's already gone. The Reverend gestures toward the open front door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dark and prim with stiff furniture left to fade. Landon pokes around, then stares at a photo of little girl Jamie with her parents. He looks up, aware that the Reverend is studying him closely.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know our planet would not suffer for one nanosecond if humans died off. But if ants disappeared, that would be catastrophic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
The Reverend waits, letting Landon suffer the silence.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
(confidence flagging)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Apropos of nothing... so. So so so so --
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<REV_SULLIVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's get something straight. You don't know me. I don't know you. But I know what you're about.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep your distance from this house -- and from Jamie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REV_SULLIVAN>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes lock with Landon's. His message clear. A NOISE and Jamie is there, carrying glasses of lemonade, all cheerful.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I miss anything?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PARSONAGE - KITCHEN - MINUTES LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jamie washes the lemonade glasses, happy. Her father comes in.
</DIRECTION>
<REV_SULLIVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Carter boy. Tell me about him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REV_SULLIVAN>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He wants help with his lines --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<REV_SULLIVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was driving the car that hit Harold Keene --
	</DIALOGUE>
</REV_SULLIVAN>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By accident --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<REV_SULLIVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jamie, he's careless. Reckless.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this really the best time to be making a new friend...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REV_SULLIVAN>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm supposed to always be alone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<REV_SULLIVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want you to see him outside school activities.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REV_SULLIVAN>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine. But I need to start deciding how to spend my time and my life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
Pause.
</DIRECTION>
<REV_SULLIVAN>
<DIRECTION>
(gentler)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry your mother isn't here to help you become a woman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REV_SULLIVAN>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad, I've become a woman without her. Just not a pretty one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JAMIE'S BEDROOM - ONE AM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jamie hops out of bed, pulls on jeans and a sweatshirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jamie peers into her father's room. He's sleeping. She tiptoes to the staircase and down. Sneaking out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. REAR ACCESS ROAD TO CEMETERY - TEN MINUTES LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Landon is waiting when Jamie appears. He has scripts in his back pocket. They smile at each other, laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
(re: her father)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. Don't say anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's a softy. Got him wrapped around my finger.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Know so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
She grins, skeptical.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jamie leads Landon toward the cemetery rear gate.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	People think I'm strange, don't they?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I try to be nice to people?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Maybe. I dunno.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you think I'm strange?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
Pause. Landon's caught off-guard by her frankness.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. But that can be good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CEMETERY - REAR GATE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jamie quickly scales the fence. Landon's right after her.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are we here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CEMETERY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jamie drops down. Takes a flashlight from her bag.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cuz it's dark and quiet and you can see into another world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
(on top of gate)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The world of the dead?

</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
(being mysterious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could be...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
He drops down, not sure what she means. She's already walking away. He follows.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My mother's buried near here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My father's alive but it's like he's dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at Landon, feeling his sorrow, then unlocks a storage shed. Opens the door. Enters. Returns a moment later carrying several pieces of an odd-looking home-made cylindrical device.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
(proud)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That is my telescope.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
SAME SCENE - MINUTES LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ten-inch Dobsonian telescope is pointed at the sky. The eye-piece is at the end of the long scope; the scope rests on a plywood base. Landon looks through the eye- piece.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV (THROUGH TELESCOPE) - CLOSE ON GOLDEN PLANET
</DIRECTION>

a beautiful view of a golden planet with a broad, flat ring system.

WIDEN.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Saturn. Beautiful.

</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Before Voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But there are thousands of them, made of floating ice --
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe debris from a moon that broke apart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or building blocks for a world that never formed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him. He smiles, embarrassed.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not smart. Just a sponge.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles, disagreeing, then looks through the telescope and changes its view.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sometimes I come here and just scan the heavens.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
(joking)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looking for intelligent life?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looking for something -- someone.

Pause. He doesn't know what to say.

<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you believe you'll see your mother again?

</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope so.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think maybe she sees me now.

Their eyes meet. She looks away. Changes the subject.

<JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
(re: telescope)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm building a larger one to see the nucleus of Haley's Comet --

</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In 76 years, me neither.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>

She likes that he knows a little about astronomy. They each lean back on a tombstone and stare at the stars.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're really into God, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In ten words or less?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.

</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My relationship with God is my own.

</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you?

</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not really.

</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
Pause.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When you do, how do you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
Landon could joke or he could reveal something.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like in a church painting. I see this giant hovering over the ground. He's wearing a robe, and has long flowing hair, and he's pointing his finger at something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you ever wonder why things happen the way they do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know there's a plan for everyone, but sometimes I don't understand what the message is -- or what the point is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is no point. You live. You die. The end.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe we're not supposed to understand, but we're supposed to have faith that someone else sees the big picture.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have to believe to have faith.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't believe in anything?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Bible. Why should I read a bunch of dumb stories about some ancient guy who supposedly worked miracles.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Interpreted by another guy like my father.
	</DIALOGUE>

	Your father doesn't like me.

Pause.

<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He doesn't trust you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sometimes I don't even trust me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
He sits up and pulls Rainmaker scripts from his back pocket. He holds one out to her. A moment passes. She takes it.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not afraid of you.

Jamie sneaks from the stairs to her room. Shuts the door. A light glows under the door, then goes out.

INT. REVEREND SULLIVAN'S BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He opens his eyes, listens, then turns over and goes back to sleep. Not suspecting. Not yet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LANDON'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dreary. Landon lies in bed, flipping the TV CHANNELS, past "Square Pegs," "Miami Vice," MTV, to a British nature documentary. After a moment, he searches for a pen and paper. Titles it "Life List." Pause. He doesn't know what to write.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BEAUFORT HIGH PARKING LOT - MORNING (BEFORE SCHOOL)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Landon, Clay, Eric, Belinda. Eric's pickup is parked by Belinda's Cabriolet. RADIOS ON, BLASTING the same station, same song: JOHN FOGERTY's "Rock and Roll Girls."
</DIRECTION>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Women are definitely evolving into men.

</ERIC>
<CLAY>

</BELINDA>

They look. Jamie's watching them. They laugh.

<ERIC>

</ERIC>
<BELINDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That is so pitiful.

He doesn't respond. She shifts from foot to foot. Confused.

His friends snicker and guffaw. She looks at them, then back to Landon.

</JAMIE>
<LANDON>

	<DIALOGUE>
	That's one girl who can't take a hint.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELINDA>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because she doesn't know what a hint is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
They laugh. Landon the loudest. It feels good, but he also feels a little... bad.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GARAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cleaned up. Swept out. The Camaro is still a dented mess. But Landon drops its hood down, wipes his hands, and climbs behind the wheel. The ENGINE STARTS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JAMIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No posters of pop stars. Books by Houston Smith, Thomas Merton, Alan Watts, Carlos Castaneda. Jamie studies, listening to JONI MITCHELL's "I Wish I Had a River." The DOORBELL RINGS.

Jamie opens the front door. Landon. A stern voice from the living room. Reverend Sullivan's.

</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is your problem?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>

She's standing in the front yard.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>

</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or anywhere where people might see us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Belinda's a very jealous person.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That would be the reason.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
Pause. He thinks she might be going for this.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So it's like you want to be secret friends.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's it! Exactly! You're reading my mind --
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then maybe you can read mine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
She walks up the porch steps, goes in the front door, and opens it. Before she goes in:
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought I saw something in you, something good. But I was wrong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN FRONT HALL - MOMENTS LATER

Jamie leans against the closed door, trembling, almost crying. In the living room, her father looks up from his reading, sees Jamie, then parts the curtains, looks out, glowers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVEREND SULLIVAN'S POV - OUT WINDOW

</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you have to be so weird?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
The front door opens, startling Landon. It's the Reverend. Red-faced with fury. Landon glares back, but then climbs in his car and drives off. Ashamed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PARSONAGE - LIVING ROOM - MINUTES LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jamie sits on the sofa. Her father doesn't look up from his reading.
</DIRECTION>
<REV_SULLIVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The first time I met him I knew. I'm proud of how you're handling yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REV_SULLIVAN>
<DIRECTION>
Tears well and Jamie's face cracks with guilt and heartbreak. She leaves before her father can see her distress.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LANDON'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Landon lies in bed watching another British nature DOCUMENTARY, this one on astronomy. He reaches for his school yearbook. Flips the pages until he finds Jamie's photo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON JAMIE'S PHOTO
</DIRECTION>

She's smiling and looks almost cute. Listed under her photo are clubs: Red Cross, Stars and Planets, Drama. Ambition: To Witness a Miracle.

Landon and Luis face each other across the half-court. Landon's got a ball and is further from the basket.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You, me, and the basket. We're the three corners of a triangle. Take one step in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
Landon and Luis both step forward.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes! Two sides the same.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>

Landon tosses him the ball. They play. Jamie glances over from a picnic table where she works with her student, Isabel. Landon looks at her, she looks away, he looks back. Thoughtful. Watching her. But not staring.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BOOK STORE - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Landon studies the books in the spiritual/religion shelf.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He picks out a book, then sits in a corner.

But before he opens the text, he looks around him, suddenly taking in all the books, all the learning, all the knowledge that could be his.

Landon changes the line and nails it. Surprising himself. Surprising her. They both know it's sincere. A moment passes. Her stomach churns with anticipation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He leans in. She closes her eyes. They kiss. Gently, genuinely. When Jamie opens her eyes, they are filled with tears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The curtain crashes down. End of act two.

CLAPPING from the other side of the curtain. Landon tries to meet Jamie's gaze. But she's looking at the floor.

	It was.

</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
Eric and Clay smirk in disbelief.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIC>

She doesn't look up. Shows him the spine: The Scarlet Letter.

	I'm reading all the novels on Mr. Rothberg's best American authors list.

(annoyed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A hundred. Then there's his classics list. And his European list.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
Landon realizes this is why she's always reading.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That on your 'Life List.' To read all those books?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
She doesn't deny it. He just dives in.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jamie. Maybe I want to try being positive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
She looks up. Examines his face for the truth.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe I miss doing that dumb play with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
Students seated near them have overheard. Whisper.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe you inspire me.

</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That sounds like horseshit.

</JAMIE>
<LANDON>

</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You lack honor. You lack compassion. You lack honesty. You lack humanity.

</JAMIE>

She heads to the old Pontiac. Landon jogs after her.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Maybe some of that is true --

</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't know the first thing about being someone's friend --

</JAMIE>
<LANDON>

	I don't want to be just your friend --

</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't know what you want --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't either. Take a look at yourself. Maybe you're scared that someone might actually like you --
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And why would that scare me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because then you couldn't hide behind your books and your telescope and your sweater and your God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
She gets into her car. Slams the door. STARTS the ENGINE. She recognizes the truth.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But the real reason you're scared? You like me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
She drives off. Clay and Eric, watching, guffaw at Landon's spectacle.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you were really my friends, you'd be helping me, not running me down.
	</DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	My number one would be getting out of Beaufort.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>

She walks away.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What does that mean?!

</HAROLD>
<LANDON>

EXT. RURAL ROADS - LATER THAT NIGHT

</DIRECTION>
<SALESMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't expect me to pay you for your -- attachment to that car.

</SALESMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Landon gazes at another dealership across the street, then adopts the surly, vaguely-threatening attitude of old.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't. I expect you to pay me for yours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
The Salesman looks from Landon to the car. He pulls a wad of cash from his pocket. Wearily counts out twelve bills. Landon takes the money, touches the Camaro's hood, then walks away.

</LANDON>
<MR_KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't say you did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_KELLY>

</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know you want to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
She grins. And tries. A small burp.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bring the air all the way up from your stomach.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
He belches again. Just as loud. She tries again, laughing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. YUGO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Landon steers the car into a parking lot for a miniature golf course with a castle-shaped video arcade and Little League diamond. A family entertainment center.

<DIRECTION>
INT. YUGO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jamie sees where they are.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Before we do this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're doing something -- ?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Before we do this, I just want to say that a good life's gotta be about more than achieving stuff -- like on your list.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
She waits for more.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's about working with what you already have -- right now -- at your fingertips -- you know, spontaneously.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you talking about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That little bit of larceny in your heart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fun.

</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATTING CAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jamie's in the cage with a helmet on. A machine tosses balls. Landon coaches from outside.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Swing! Keep your bat parallel to the ground. Follow through. Follow through!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
Jamie is laughing too hard to hit anything. The balls keep coming. She ducks out of the way and grasps the fence and leans in. Landon leans in on his side. They'd be embracing if the fence weren't there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the b.g., kids from their school. Giggling, whispering.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Landon looks over at them.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
(to Jamie)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HIGHWAY - TRAVELING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The YUGO ROARS down the asphalt. A sign for the approaching state line whips by.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. YUGO - TRAVELING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jamie and Landon. With STEVIE NICKS' "Talk to Me" ON the RADIO.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The cells in our bodies are always changing. In six or seven years all your cells have changed. You could be like a completely new person from the inside out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That what's happening to you, only faster?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
He grins. Pulls the car over.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get out. Come on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
He leaps out, leaving the headlights on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Landon takes Jamie's hand and pulls her toward some invisible place.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where -- what -- are we -- ?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
He keeps tugging her. She follows him. Laughing.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stand right here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
He leans down and lifts one of her feet a foot from the other. He notices a large bruise on her leg. She brushes her dress down.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're acting like a crazy person.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're straddling the state line. You're in two places at once.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
She's thrilled at his solution to her wish. He walks to the shoulder of the road.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Repeat after me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
Huh? He does a cartwheel. She laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm gonna teach you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BEACH (NEUSE RIVER) - LATE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A starry night with a bright moon. Glimmering silver water. Jamie and Landon walk onto a dock. DISTANT FIREWORKS BOOM.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's places like this that make me certain there's a God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
(surprised)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're sometimes not sure?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sure. Pretty sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
They reach the end of the dock. She turns to face the WIND. It blows her hair. She turns his face the same way.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's like the wind. I can't see it but I feel it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
He closes his eyes. Feeling the wind. Opens them again, rejecting the idea.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can measure wind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uncertainty makes you uncomfortable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you actually know with religion?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wonder. Beauty. Joy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat, quieter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
She's embarrassed. She tries to avoid implying anything.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My mother told me God is love, so when you're feeling love, you're feeling God.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think talking about these things -- threatens their very beauty and mystery.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
Her tone is matter-of-fact, but Landon's got a serious and tender look on his face. He touches her hair.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
(almost a whisper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't understand...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe you're not supposed to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
He moves closer.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I might kiss you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
She looks down. Shy.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I might do it wrong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
(tenderly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not possible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
He touches her neck, her cheek, her mouth. Then leans in and kisses her. A tender, soft kiss. He pulls away. They look at each other a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you, Jamie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
There, he put it out there, risked looking and feeling foolish. Not the old Landon. Jamie looks away. Mixed emotions. Happy and sad.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
(gently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now's when you say something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
(overwhelmed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't -- explain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
She turns back to him, her eyes shining. She touches his face and they kiss again, deeply.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But after a few moments, she drops her chin onto his shoulder. Smiling, glowing even, but slightly aloof, staring at the water. He pulls away slightly to study her face. He touches her cheek and brings her back from wherever she's been.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You make me feel...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
(hopeful)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Loved?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That. And less strange.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
Tears run down her cheeks. Landon wipes them away with his thumbs, attributing them to happiness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARSONAGE - FRONT PORCH - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Landon follows Jamie up the steps. The lights in the living room are on. THROUGH the windows, they can see her father taking down the Christmas tree.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be very quiet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls her to him. Kisses her. The front door opens.
</DIRECTION>
<REV_SULLIVAN>
<DIRECTION>
(embarrassed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Landon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REV_SULLIVAN>
<DIRECTION>
Landon and Jamie separate, but Landon keeps an arm over her shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Reverend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
Reverend Sullivan studies the two young people.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
(whispers to Jamie)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Happy New Year.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
And he goes. Jamie walks by her father and into the house. Not saying anything. He watches her. What has he allowed?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BEAUFORT HIGH - COURTYARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Landon and Jamie head into school. Landon nods to Belinda, others. They glare back.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
(to Belinda and others)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's your damage?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Landon and Jamie arrive at his locker. It's been kicked in.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Assholes. This happen to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twice a year.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
Bang, bang, bang. Landon kicks in every locker in his row. A dozen in all. Jamie watches, a little frightened by his anger. But then he turns to her and grins.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now they all match.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAFETERIA - NOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Landon eats alone, ignored by Eric and Clay. Jamie approaches with her tray, red-faced, tearful.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She hesitates about sitting -- feeling bad that Landon's being diminished, ostracized. She thinks he doesn't see her. But as she turns to leave, he pulls a chair out for her and smiles. She sits. Landon sees her face.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's wr--?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
(choked up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Challenger exploded. Principal Kelly's about to make an announcement.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
The PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM CRACKLES. Landon takes Jamie's hand as the room hushes.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Away from here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FIRE TOWER (CONSERVATION LAND) - STAIRS - HOUR LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Landon leads Jamie up, round and round, to the top of the tall steel tower.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TOP OF TOWER - VIEWING AREA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They exit the staircase to a small 360 degree overlook. Jamie's amazed at the view.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you know this place?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Before the divorce. My father used to take me here. Fire spotting was his summer job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
They look off to the curve of the horizon, where sea meets sky.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	From here he proved to me the earth isn't flat.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	On rainy days, we'd be above the clouds.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What would you do up here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look. Talk. Not talk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls a deck of cards from his jacket pocket. They sit and he starts to shuffle. Not too well. Jamie takes the deck. Shuffles like a card shark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CEMETERY - REAR GATE - NIGHT (FEW DAYS LATER)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jamie is already waiting when Landon's Yugo pulls up. He gets out, walks to her, they kiss.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What'd you tell your father?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The truth. I just left you out of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
She climbs up and over the wall. He follows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. INSIDE CEMETERY - MINUTES LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jamie fits the pieces of her telescope together.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When did you build this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was twelve.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
Landon shakes his head, amazed.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not that complicated.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
Landon doubts this.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's an alt-azimuth design with one parabolic mirror and one secondary flat one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's the one you're building?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In my back yard.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause, embarrassed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I lied before. It's hardly started. But when it's done, it will have twice the power of this one --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait, back up. You lied?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kinda. Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
He grins, loving her even more.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what do you want to see?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mars.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mars doesn't rise until 2:30 A.M. --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
He opens his backpack. Pulls out the contents.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A Thermos of hot coffee. A blanket. Socks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You planned this --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hoped for it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
Pause.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you trying to seduce me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Why? Are you seducible?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
(firm, but smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what I thought.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches back into his backpack. Pulls out a second blanket.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ergo, a second blanket. One for me, one for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
He hands her one. She takes it, smiling, reassured.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ergo?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
(slightly embarrassed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about your father?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm always home by midnight and he's always asleep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PARSONAGE - REVEREND SULLIVAN'S BEDROOM - MIDNIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reverend Sullivan sits up in bed. His feet find slippers on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JAMIE'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reverend Sullivan, wearing a robe, enters quietly. Checking on his daughter. Her bed is empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET TO ACCESS ROAD - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The old Pontiac slows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OLD PONTIAC
</DIRECTION>

Reverend Sullivan looks down the access road to the rear cemetery gate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVEREND'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Yugo parked by the gate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Reverend struggles with what to do. After a moment, he decides not to interfere; he'll pick his moment. He keeps driving.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CEMETERY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jamie and Landon are looking at the heavens through the telescope.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's Pluto?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In Virgo, but it's about 1000 times too faint to see.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the best thing I can see tonight?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
He draws her close, they kiss. She shyly pulls away. Their hands still touching until she looks again into the telescope eyepiece.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The second best thing is Jupiter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
She swivels the telescope into position for Jupiter and steps aside so he can look. But he picks up the flashlight, pulls a diagram from his pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you locate XXI5639I?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
She takes the diagram, studies it, and adjusts the scope.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here. Why am I looking at this star?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I had it named for you. I know it's not an official designation --
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
She couldn't be happier. She reaches for his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's wonderful. I love you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
It's the first time he's heard it. He pulls her into his arms. They kiss. Passionately. She starts to object.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
(respecting her boundaries)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. I'm stopping.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
And he does. They snuggle. Silence, then:
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's number one?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
Long pause.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
(very shy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In April when the dogwoods and wisteria are blooming... Get married.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
He doesn't make fun. He strokes her hair. Kisses her forehead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN - 5 AM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Landon enters from outside. Cynthia, still in her waitress uniform, is sitting at the table, drinking coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<CYNTHIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A late night or an early morning?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYNTHIA>
<LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
(honest)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Late night.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(smart-aleck)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<CYNTHIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Were you with Jamie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYNTHIA>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<CYNTHIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sleeping with her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYNTHIA>
<DIRECTION>
Landon doesn't dignify this question with an answer.
</DIRECTION>
<CYNTHIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was cleaning yesterday. I found this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYNTHIA>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls Landon's Life List from her pocket. Landon is horrified. She reads it.
</DIRECTION>
<CYNTHIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Scuba dive. Touch a moon rock. Learn to read Egyptian hieroglyphs. Go to college?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She talking to you 'bout this stuff?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYNTHIA>
<DIRECTION>
Landon doesn't answer. She puts the list on the table. Smoothes it. Gently discouraging.
</DIRECTION>
<CYNTHIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honey, some of this is... farfetched. You take after me. People skills and common sense. Good dependable qualities.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYNTHIA>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could take after Dad, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<CYNTHIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You do. You're handsome and charming.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYNTHIA>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I meant he's a doctor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<CYNTHIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's eight years of school and training -- after college. And all that doesn't necessarily make you a better human being.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYNTHIA>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could do it if I tried. Even Kelly thinks so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<CYNTHIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That'd be something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYNTHIA>
<DIRECTION>
She doesn't want to discourage him, but she wants him to be practical and realistic.
</DIRECTION>
<CYNTHIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But if it doesn't happen, grab for something within reach. Life's tough enough without causing yourself disappointment --
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYNTHIA>
<LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
(angry now)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever my life is, I'm going to be friggin' sure I'm never disappointed --
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<CYNTHIA>
<DIRECTION>
(honest)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Disappointment isn't something anyone plans for.

</REV_SULLIVAN>
<DIRECTION>
She turns to him, upset. Her anger spilling out.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe. But that's not the real reason. You think if I tell, he'll disappear and that's what you want! Me all to yourself!

</JAMIE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I made you do too many things, kept you up all night --

</LANDON>
<JAMIE>

	No. The drugs just stopped working. If anything, doing things I love kept me healthy longer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>

Pause.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>

He hugs her close, rocking her, comforting her and himself.

INT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - EVENING (MID-FEBRUARY)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small group of students sit on stage reading from Our Town, rehearsing. Jamie and Landon sit together in the third row, holding hands. Landon glances at her, realizes she's asleep. Pulls her sweater over her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JEFFERSON HIGH - LIBRARY - SATURDAY MORNING
</DIRECTION>

He reaches into a cooler on the floor of the back seat.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>

</LANDON>
<JAMIE>

He places a red heart-shaped box in her lap.

<LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
(apologetic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not very original. Happy Valentine's Day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>

He grins. She looks crestfallen, feels terrible.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't even think about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>

He takes a chocolate. Pops it in his mouth. Grins.

Jamie and Landon are looking at stars. A long quiet moment.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you thinking?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
(honest)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That I want you to take me home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now? We just --

</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>

She begins taking the telescope apart. Depressed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CEMETERY GATE - HALF HOUR LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jamie looks at the high fence, weary, then reaches into a pocket for a key. Unlocks the gate. Swings the gate open. Landon's astonished.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have a key?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. I've just never needed it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you talk to my father?

</LANDON>

<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARSONAGE - BACK YARD - NEXT DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reverend Sullivan is up a ladder. Cleaning a gutter. Landon stands below, a few feet away, gathering his nerve. He walks over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON LADDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Reverend is busy ignoring Landon standing below. A long beat, then:
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
(calling up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir. Being ignored is beginning to feel preferable to being noticed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
The Reverend looks down.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be honest. I don't know if I can pray, but I can do just about anything else.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
Neither Landon nor the Reverend see Jamie come out of the house and walk over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON GROUND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Landon shields his eyes with a hand to see the Reverend better.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever you need. Whatever Jamie needs. I'm here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could start by driving her to school --
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not going back to school.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
Landon and her father both turn to her. Pale, wane. They understand what she is saying.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can tell anyone you want. I don't care.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
She goes into the house. Landon and Reverend Sullivan look at each other, then away, uncomfortable. That didn't sound like her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEAUFORT HIGH - HALLWAY - MONDAY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Landon, looking haggard, moves slowly as he cleans out Jamie's locker.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Students stare as he carefully places her things, including the pink sweater, in a shopping bag. They part and hush as he passes by. News travels fast. Clay and Eric step forward.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. Landon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We heard 'bout Jamie Sullivan. She --

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say nothing. Nothing 'bout her.

</LANDON>
<ERIC>
<DIRECTION>
(misunderstood, genuine)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Hey. We're sorry, man!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>
<DIRECTION>
Landon turns back. Surprised. Inspects Belinda. Eric. Clay. Others. No one speaks.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too late and not enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
He pushes past Belinda's new boyfriend, heading for the office.

</LANDON>
<MR_KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're excused.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Landon heads for the door.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How is she?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Landon can't answer. Too emotional.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You will graduate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Landon looks up, astounded.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I have to tutor you myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Landon nods, accepting, appreciative.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JAMIE'S BEDROOM - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Landon puts away the contents of the shopping bag. Jamie's in bed, wearing the sweater.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yesterday I felt sick, horrible. Today I feel like riding my bike. Or dancing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
He turns on the CLOCK RADIO next to her bed. Finds a WALTZ. Offers his hand. Pulls her out of bed. She's in pajamas.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know how to waltz??
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
(bashful)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was going to fake it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I always fake it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
So they waltz, faking, stumbling and laughing, holding each other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PARSONAGE - STAIRCASE - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reverend Sullivan hears the MUSIC and LAUGHTER. He frowns, afraid for Jamie's health.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JAMIE'S BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jamie grips Landon's arms, seems to slip, suddenly too exhausted to carry her weight. Landon picks her up, gently carries her back to bed. Settles her in.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
(murmurs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tired.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
Landon sits on her bed. Strokes her hair. They look at each other. Landon reaches for her hand. When he looks at her face again, she's asleep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LANDON'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - ANOTHER DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Landon's sitting on his childhood tree swing, twisting side to side. Pensive. His mother comes out of the house.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Time seems to be slowing down and speeding up at the same time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches to put a hand on his shoulder. He lets her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CEMETERY - EARLY MARCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rear gate is open. A caretaker waits while Landon carries pieces of the older telescope to his car. A tall pile of parts is already at his car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric and Clay drive up in Eric's pickup. Gravel flying. MUSIC BLASTING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PICKUP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric and Clay spy Landon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CEMETERY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Landon freezes, not sure what to expect.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PICKUP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The truck makes a circle around Landon, then stops. The MUSIC QUIETS. Eric and Clay jump down. A long tense moment, then:
</DIRECTION>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
Without a word, Clay walks to the Yugo, lifts the heaviest telescope part, and carries it to the bed of the pickup. Eric follows suit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARSONAGE - BACK YARD - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Landon studies the pieces of the smaller telescope and how they fit together. They are like a map for how to build the bigger one.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARSONAGE DRIVEWAY - NEXT DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Landon unloads an impossibly large round cardboard concrete form-tube from his car. Carries it around the house toward the back yard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JAMIE'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jamie wakes from a nap. She looks thinner, grayer. She hears HAMMERING. She hauls herself up and to a window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAMIE'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Landon working on the new telescope. He looks up at her window. Sees her there. Smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reverend Sullivan comes in to check on Jamie. She's standing at the window.
</DIRECTION>
<REV_SULLIVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that boy doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REV_SULLIVAN>
<DIRECTION>
She turns to look at him and collapses into his arms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL - PATIENT ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jamie lies in bed, eyes closed. Hooked to monitors, pumps, an IV drip. Landon holding her hand. Reverend Sullivan talks quietly with a doctor. Hearing bad news.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOSPITAL - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sky is pink. A squirrel runs along a telephone wire. The Yugo is the only car in the visitor lot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PATIENT ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Landon, in yesterday's clothes, dozes lightly. Jamie moves and he starts, fully awake. She opens her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
She nods. Sleepy. Closes her eyes again. He rests his head on her shoulder and weeps. Her eyes open, then close again. There's nothing to say.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE JAMIE'S ROOM - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reverend Sullivan looks through the window in the door at the scene within. He hesitates, then pushes the door open.

<DIRECTION>
INT. PATIENT ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reverend Sullivan enters.
</DIRECTION>
<REV_SULLIVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Landon. You go on home.

</REV_SULLIVAN>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<REV_SULLIVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need to be with her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REV_SULLIVAN>
<DIRECTION>
There's only one chair. Landon nods and goes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Reverend sits, closes his eyes a moment. When he opens them, she's looking at him.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
He kisses her forehead, then sits back.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So serious.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<REV_SULLIVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jamie, God is not punishing you. No God I know wants anyone to be sick or feel pain or suffer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REV_SULLIVAN>
<DIRECTION>
Pause.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When Mom died you told me God wanted her more, loved her more --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<REV_SULLIVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was wrong. Nobody could have wanted or loved your mother more than we did. Not even God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REV_SULLIVAN>
<DIRECTION>
He lets this sink in.
</DIRECTION>
<REV_SULLIVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God loaned you to me, entrusted you to my care. I'm failing you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REV_SULLIVAN>
<DIRECTION>
She looks away, agreeing without saying so.
</DIRECTION>
<REV_SULLIVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jamie. I make you the same promise that God does.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will always be with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REV_SULLIVAN>
<DIRECTION>
She sits up and embraces him. He wraps his arms around her. Tight. She closes her eyes, tears welling, never wanting to let him go. Her father.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BEAUFORT HIGH SCHOOL - HOUR LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the marquee on the front lawn: "WELCOME HALEY'S COMET." The Yugo parks in the b.g.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Landon picks up a pile of books and assignments. Looks through them, then eyes Miss Tarbox.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's Jamie's book?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<MISS_TARBOX>

</MISS_TARBOX>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. I need it today!

</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Kelly steps out of his inner office. Sees Landon's anguished face, his exhaustion.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll drive a copy over to her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Landon nods his appreciation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL - PATIENT ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jamie looks smaller. Her eyes have blue circles beneath. The Hemingway novel on the bedstand. Belinda pushes the door open. Peeks in. Not sure she is welcome.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Landon is sitting in a chair. He sees her, motions for her to come in. Quietly.
</DIRECTION>
<BELINDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She asleep?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELINDA>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll tell her you were here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
Pause. Awkwardness.
</DIRECTION>
<BELINDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give her this, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELINDA>
<DIRECTION>
She hands Landon a small photo album.
</DIRECTION>
<BELINDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pictures from the play. Jamie looks pretty --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELINDA>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry about how we --
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<BELINDA>
<DIRECTION>
(conciliatory)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. You're with who you should be. It's like she chose you.

</BELINDA>
<LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
(agreeing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I have no idea why.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<BELINDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELINDA>
<DIRECTION>
She hugs him quickly, then leaves. Landon goes to the window, looks out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAME SCENE - HOURS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sky is grayer, darker. Landon is still at the window. Jamie wakes.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi.

</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
He goes to her side.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>

</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
He kisses her.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have something for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches under her pillow for the worn book from the attic. She offers it to Landon.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry. It's not a Bible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
He takes it.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My mother made it for me before I was born.

He kneels on the floor. Puts his head on her pillow next to hers.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe I believe God sent you to me because I am ill. To help me through.

He touches her face tenderly.

	</DIALOGUE>
</CYNTHIA>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL - PATIENT ROOM - ANOTHER AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jamie's breathing is shallower. Landon's reading her The Sheltering Sky. He pauses, looks up. Isabel, Jamie's student, is standing in the doorway. Jamie sees her too. She smiles weakly.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Isabel?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<ISABEL>
<DIRECTION>
(shy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ISABEL>
<DIRECTION>
Isabel comes in. Landon offers her the book. She takes it and keeps going from where Landon left off. Stumbling but reading. Jamie grins.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's been working with you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
Isabel looks shyly at Landon. Jamie shakes her head, amazed. Landon nods to Isabel and she begins reading again.

Landon quietly opens the back door to the kitchen.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Landon. You have two parents. We're both here for you even --
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYNTHIA>
<DR_CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- even if we're not here for each other anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_CARTER>
<DIRECTION>
Landon is listening.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to do this. Please let me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_CARTER>
<DIRECTION>
He holds out a check. For a lot of money. Landon takes it. Grateful.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly, to both parents)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PARSONAGE - JAMIE'S BEDROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A smaller Jamie lies in a hospital bed, seemingly asleep. Hooked to an IV. Bottles of pills. Landon dozes in a comfortable chair. A nurse sits in a corner, reading.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric and Clay stand in the doorway, not sure what to do. Jamie opens her eyes, smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't wake Landon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
They tiptoe in. Stand on either side of her bed.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do I look scary?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not too bad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You all right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
A dumb question but she handles it well.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Things could be better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
Awkward pause.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We thought you'd be asleep --

<JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
(trying to help)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know what to say either.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
Clay hands her an envelope.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls out a stack of worn bills.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For the book drive. Landon told us about it --
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We told everyone at school.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>
<DIRECTION>
Jamie takes their hands, holds them. Thanking them silently. Her eyes shining with tears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LANDON'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Landon sits at his desk, sketching the larger telescope, making a few computations.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A library book on Haley's Comet is open. A stack of similar books by his elbow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cynthia enters wearing her waitressing outfit.
</DIRECTION>
<CYNTHIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What can I do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYNTHIA>
<DIRECTION>
He shrugs. Tears fill his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everything's being done but it's not enough. I have to find something -- more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<CYNTHIA>
<DIRECTION>
(gently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Landon, honey. There's nothing more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYNTHIA>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't mean about Jamie being sick. I mean about Jamie and me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<CYNTHIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be with her when she wants. Make sure she never feels alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYNTHIA>
<DIRECTION>
Landon thinks his mother is also talking about herself.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mom, I'm not going anywhere. Not yet anyway.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
Pause.
</DIRECTION>
<CYNTHIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When you are ready, I want you to feel free to go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYNTHIA>
<DIRECTION>
They embrace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LANDON'S BEDROOM - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Landon opens Jamie's mother's book. A photo of Jamie falls out -- one taken by Belinda.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON PHOTO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jamie, beautiful, smiling at the audience.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LANDON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
considers the photo, finds a page to tuck it into.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON HANDWRITTEN JOTTING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"For Landon" above some underlined text, a Psalm from the Bible.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
(reading aloud)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'I cry to you my Lord, my rock! Do not be deaf to me, for if you are silent, I shall go down to the pit like the rest. Hear my voice raised in petition as I cry to you for help, as I raise my hands, my Lord, toward your holy of holies.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
Landon knows Jamie underlined this for him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Landon tears down the steps. Past his mother to the front door. He's out the door before she even turns around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PARSONAGE - REVEREND SULLIVAN'S BEDROOM - MIDNIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reverend Sullivan sits up in bed. His feet find slippers on the floor. He looks haggard, his hair thinner, his face defeated.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JAMIE'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Reverend, wearing his robe, checks on his sleeping daughter. The night nurse nods as he tucks in blankets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SOUND. Then another. Reverend Sullivan goes to the window. Parts the drapes. Looks out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A dozen flashlights in a big circle. Landon in the middle, working feverishly on the new telescope.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BACK YARD - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The back porch light comes on. Reverend Sullivan steps out onto the back porch. Landon looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
(flushes, almost manic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to finish it tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
Without a word, the Reverend turns around and goes back inside. Leaving the porch light on. Landon goes back to work.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BACK YARD - MINUTES LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reverend Sullivan comes out. Dressed. He carries two mugs of coffee and a brightly burning kerosene camp lantern. Peace offerings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks over, sets down the lantern, hands Landon a mug. Ready to work.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've almost finished the rocker. Did she order mirrors?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<REV_SULLIVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REV_SULLIVAN>
<DIRECTION>
As they walk to the garage.
</DIRECTION>
<REV_SULLIVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have materials for the side bearings?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REV_SULLIVAN>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm using an old phonographic turntable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<REV_SULLIVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For the focuser?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REV_SULLIVAN>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A chrome-plated brass pipe from a drain line.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
The Reverend nods, impressed. He yanks the garage door up. Goes in.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know about this stuff?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<REV_SULLIVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I helped Jamie with the first one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REV_SULLIVAN>
<LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
(surprised)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought she built it herself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<REV_SULLIVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She did. But hardly anyone does anything truly alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REV_SULLIVAN>
<DIRECTION>
The Reverend carries out a large cardboard postal package. Landon takes it as the Reverend lowers the garage door.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
(serious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need to do this alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
Reverend Sullivan searches Landon's face for a long moment, understanding, then turns and heads for the back door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHURCH - REVEREND'S OFFICE - NEXT MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Landon stands in the doorway. The Reverend is wiping his glasses, his face, maybe of tears. He sees Landon.
</DIRECTION>
<REV_SULLIVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You finish?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REV_SULLIVAN>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A few minutes ago. I have to ask you something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
Long pause.
</DIRECTION>
<REV_SULLIVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When I was seventeen, I was sent up for a year for stealing a car.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sometimes I still feel that boy inside me and I don't like him.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I like you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REV_SULLIVAN>
<DIRECTION>
The Reverend stands, offers Landon his hand. Landon takes it. The two men shake. Allies now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JAMIE'S ROOM - THAT EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jamie opens her eyes. But can barely keep them open. Groggy from pain medication. Landon's standing there. Showered, clean clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're going out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
He starts helping the nurse disconnect her IV.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I -- go out?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll be fine for a few minutes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
Jamie looks at the nurse. Uncertain. The nurse nods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARSONAGE ROOF - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Landon carries Jamie out a large attic window. The finished large telescope is set up. Pointing at the sky. She's in her nightgown, wrapped in a blanket.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
(grateful, touching it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's beautiful... Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
But she looks at the lights of the house and streets around them.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know what we'll be able to see... Help me stand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
He checks his watch.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a sec.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
As she turns to him, questioning, the neighborhood suddenly darkens as the street lamps and lights in every nearby house are switched off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DOWN STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Neighbors step outside. Hold up binoculars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BEAUFORT HIGH - PARKING LOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Members of the Star Club and other students look through traditional telescopes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARSONAGE ROOF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jamie hugs Landon in gratitude.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have five minutes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
Jamie, tears streaming, braces herself against Landon and she peers into the telescope eyepiece. She pulls back, wipes her eyes, then looks again. She swings the telescope into the correct position.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HER POV THROUGH TELESCOPE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Haley's Comet, its icy nucleus issuing the jets and streamers of gas, dust, and debris that form the comet's hazy head and long tail.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The comet of the century...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She steps back so he can see. He looks quickly, then moves aside so she can keep looking. She's completely engrossed. A long, quiet moment, then:
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You love me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
She leans away from the eyepiece and looks at him -- yes.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you do something for me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Landon. I can't even do for myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But if you could, you would?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
His throat tightens with nervousness, with hope, fear, sadness, and love.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you marry me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
HER FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Illness, happiness, disbelief.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SOUTHERN BAPTIST CHURCH - EARLY APRIL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sea of pink, purple, and white blossoms. Dogwoods, wisteria, azaleas, and roses blooming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SOUTHERN BAPTIST CHURCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bursting with everyone who knows Jamie and Landon -- every kid in their high school, including Eric, Clay, Belinda; teachers, including Ms. Garber; Mr. Kelly; Luis and Isabel and others from Jefferson High; her father's congregation; Cynthia Carter; Dr. Carter's new wife and their two kids; neighbors; hospital staff and home nurses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Landon stands with his father by the altar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The "WEDDING MARCH" begins...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The double doors at the back of the church open. Everyone turns to look at the bride. Gasps of joy and sadness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LANDON'S POV - JAMIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flanked by a nurse and Reverend Sullivan. She's wearing her Lizzie dress from the play. It hangs loosely, but still becomes her. She's a beautiful bride.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Landon swells with pride.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jamie smiles. Then, leaning on her father, she slowly makes her way down the aisle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the pews -- few dry eyes follow her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jamie -- halfway -- stops to rest and catch her breath. A moment later, she and her father continue.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A long, difficult walk. A walk to remember.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT ALTAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The nurse rolls a wheelchair up as Jamie and her father near.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Applause breaks out as Jamie reaches Landon's side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jamie sits. Exhausted.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Landon kneels to be the same height as Jamie in her chair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pause. Dr. Carter kneels. Showing solidarity with his son.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reverend Sullivan, standing, leans down to kiss Jamie's cheek. Trying to keep his emotions in check.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LANDON AND JAMIE'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reverend Sullivan towering over them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reverend Sullivan kneels, too.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jamie takes Landon's hand in her right hand, her father's hand in her left. Linking the three together.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The congregation silences.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reverend Sullivan looks up from his Bible. Struggling.
</DIRECTION>
<REV_SULLIVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As a father, I'm supposed to give away my daughter. But I can no more give Jamie away than I can give away my heart. But I can let another share in the joy she has given me. May God's blessings be with you both.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REV_SULLIVAN>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches out, offering a hand to Landon. Completing the circle.
</DIRECTION>
<REV_SULLIVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Landon, repeat after me. Do you take...
	</DIALOGUE>
</REV_SULLIVAN>
<DIRECTION>
As words are spoken and vows and rings exchanged, the CAMERA MOVES ACROSS the faces of those at the altar -- Jamie, Landon, Dr. Carter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TO the first row of the congregation -- Cynthia Carter, Josh, Eric, Clay.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then BACK row by row as the Reverend begins reading a passage from the book Jamie's mother made for her. His voice soft and melodious, like a poet reading his own work.
</DIRECTION>
<REV_SULLIVAN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Love is always patient and kind. It is never jealous. Love is never boastful or conceited. It is never rude or selfish. It does not take offense and is not resentful. Love takes no pleasure in other people's sins, but delights in the truth. It is always ready to excuse, to trust, to hope, and to endure whatever comes...'
	</DIALOGUE>
</REV_SULLIVAN>
<DIRECTION>
And the CAMERA MOVES OUT the double doors to find...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PARSONAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
in a different season. Winter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UP the front steps and INTO...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LIVING ROOM (PRESENT DAY)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As it is now, in present day.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The nurse disappears, leaving Landon Carter, 33, waiting. Looking at a framed photo of Jamie as Lizzie in The Rainmaker...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The nurse returns, helping an old man as he shuffles in. Reverend Sullivan. He's stooped, thin, balding. His skin parchment thin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two men embrace. Stiff, uncomfortable, uncertain.
</DIRECTION>
<REV_SULLIVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've been well?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REV_SULLIVAN>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. You?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<REV_SULLIVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Getting by.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REV_SULLIVAN>
<DIRECTION>
Pause. Why is he here? The Reverend waits.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
(fumbling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm -- I'm returning something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
He twists the ring on his finger. Removes it.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This belongs to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
He gives his wedding ring to the Reverend. Pause. Landon searches for something meaningful to say.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She taught me -- everything. She saved my life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
The Reverend turns away, overcome with sadness. Realizing now why Landon has come.
</DIRECTION>
<REV_SULLIVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're marrying again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REV_SULLIVAN>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<REV_SULLIVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jamie wanted that. She told me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REV_SULLIVAN>
<DIRECTION>
Landon is grateful to know this. He makes a move to go. Then turns back.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry she never got her miracle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANDON>
<REV_SULLIVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She did. It was you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REV_SULLIVAN>
<DIRECTION>
Landon, deeply touched, embraces the old man again. Warmly, fully. Two men still grieving, saying good-bye.
</DIRECTION>
<ADULT_LANDON>

EXT. NEUSE RIVER - THAT AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Landon walks alone. His hair and clothing tousled by a steady gentle wind.
</DIRECTION>
<ADULT_LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She made me a believer. In love. In life. In the journey that never ends...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADULT_LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
Landon stops. Faces the wind. Lets the air swirl over him.
</DIRECTION>
<ADULT_LANDON>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... And in the mystery of all things you can't see but feel everywhere around you...

</ADULT_LANDON>

He closes his eyes. She's there...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT.

THE END
