EXT. AVALON STREET - WATTS, CALIFORNIA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An Olds creeps slowly along the street. BADASSES loiter. Pass before the headlights. A fight is in progress out front of a topless bar. Punches are thrown. STRAGGLERS laugh at the mayhem.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SIDE STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This street is DEAD SILENT. The sidewalk is empty. A junkyard dog trots by on his nightly rounds. The Olds pulls into a spot at the curb. Tires CRACKLE over broken glass. The car engine DIES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OLDS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The driver taps a Camel cigarette. Raises it to his lips. Lights it with his Zippo. The flame reveals the face of JACK WALSH. Strong. Haggard. A killer stare. Pressure-cooker of a man. Always about to explode. The flame dances. Blue smoke swirls. The flame fades.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walsh smokes his cigarette and stares at a four-story slum across the street. He glances at his watch. It's an old and battered Timex. It's been with Walsh for many years.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He checks his .45. It's loaded. Slips it back into his shoulder holster. Opens the door. Gets out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SIDE STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walsh raises his collar against the Santa Ana wind and trots toward the slum.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY OF SLUM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walsh enters. Eyes darting. Quietly moves up the first flight of stairs. The joint is SILENT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walsh turns the corner and moves up the stairs of the second floor. Catches a liquor bottle with his foot. BOUNCE. CLANK. CRASH. Walsh grimaces. A dog BARKS from a first-floor apartment. Cursing, Walsh moves for the third floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THIRD FLOOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walsh hits the top step. Squints. Finds apartment 3C. Approaches. Stops. Puts his ear to the door. Removes a lock pick. Crouches. Slips it in. Jiggles it quietly. Drops it. Walsh bends over to retrieve the lock pick, when SUDDENLY:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLAMMM!!! A shotgun UNLOADS from the other side of the door. Wood chunks fly. A gaping hole appears in the door right where Walsh's head was a moment before. Walsh bounces on his ass. Curses. Gets up. Pulls out his .45. Doesn't need to open the door to see into the apartment. Twenty-two-year-old MONROE BOUCHET climbs out of his window into the night. Clanging down the fire escape. Walsh runs down the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BOUCHET'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walsh runs through the apartment to the window. Looks out. Sees Bouchet making his way up the fire escape. He goes out after him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bouchet makes his way up to the roof and starts running. The lights of downtown L.A. sparkle in the distance. Walsh hoists himself up to the roof, pursuing the fleeing Bouchet. Bouchet leaps from his building over to the next. Walsh, hot on his trail, does the same thing. Bouchet vaults over another alley to a third building. Ditto Walsh. Amazed that Walsh is still on his tail, Bouchet makes his most daring jump yet. He lands with a tumble, scoops up his shotgun and keeps moving. Without missing a beat, Walsh makes the leap and MISSES! He grabs at the ledge with his armpits. He slides slowly, grabbing for dear life as the old ledge cracks. It's a four-story drop. Some debris falls away. Walsh manages to pull himself back onto the roof. Winded, he spots Bouchet going down a fire escape at the far end of the building. Walsh is up and after him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BOUCHET'S BUILDING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Walsh appears at the rooftop, Bouchet opens FIRE. Walsh ducks. Bouchet continues down the metal staircase. Walsh clangs down after him. Bouchet hits the ground and runs into an alley. Walsh drops to the concrete in pursuit. As he turns into the alley, Bouchet fires again. Garbage cans EXPLODE. HEADLIGHTS of a car turn into the far end of the alley, aiming at Bouchet. Bouchet tries to avoid the car. Can't. He gets side-swiped. Growls with pain when he lands. The car SKIDS to a stop. From it emerges MARVIN DORFLER. If Walsh is the "Avis" of bounty hunters, Dorfler is the "Rent-a-Wreck." He makes up for his deficiencies with force. He's loaded with dim, impulsive behavior. Walsh approaches. He and Dorfler lock eyes. They know each other well. Too well.

Bouchet looks at Walsh.

Bouchet, confused, opens the car door. Walsh does the same with his car door. Then he BACKS UP quickly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. L.A. COUNTY JAIL PARKING LOT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Both doors are RIPPED off the car by the two pillars at the entrance. Then Walsh swings Dorfler's car into the parking lot through the exit. The tires EXPLODE as Walsh proceeds the wrong way over the metal teeth that block incoming traffic. Walsh keeps moving and SLAMS into a brick wall, CRUNCHING the front end. Then Walsh puts it in reverse and ROARS into the parking spot he targets, CRUNCHING the rear end of the car against another brick wall.

A few PRISONERS mill about with their lawyers. A JANITOR mops the floor. Handcuffed to Walsh, Bouchet almost starts to cry.
</DIRECTION>
<BOUCHET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All I did was come home and he was sleepin' with my old lady. And I shot him. Then I heard on the TV that the dude was "lucid." I didn't do that to him. I swear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOUCHET>
<DIRECTION>
Walsh looks at Bouchet. Feels sorry for him.
</DIRECTION>
<WALSH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Lucid" means he was coherent. Makin' sense when he talked.

INT. JOE MOSCONE'S BAIL BOND OFFICE - DAWN

Second floor. Huge glass doors. Three desks. Fourteen tons of paper. A thirty-year-old weasel of an assistant, JERRY GEISLER, reads a newspaper. He sucks toothpicks for a living. Walsh enters.

</WALSH>
<MOSCONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The point, Jack, is twenty-five thousand bucks. I bailed the accountant out. Only, I didn't know who he was at the time. If I knew, I never would of put up the bond. I mean it would only be a matter of time before Serrano vanished him from the planet and I'm out my four hundred and fifty grand.

Manhattan looms across the East River. As Walsh's car glides down the street, he notices a woman placing a suitcase in the trunk of a car. She heads back into her house, leaving the door ajar. Walsh checks the address of the house. Stops. Gets out. Sneaks toward the front porch.

Downstairs is dark. Walsh creeps across the living room. HEARS MOVEMENT going on upstairs. Walsh inches for the stairs, moving up them SILENTLY. Walsh is not alone. A pair of eyes watch him. A shadow moves across the wall. A huge German shepherd follows him across the living room floor.
</DIRECTION>

INT. STAIRCASE - NIGHT

INT. UPSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT

.45 at the ready, Walsh approaches the bedroom. Walsh is beginning to sweat. About to make his move. He turns. Locks eyes with the shepherd. Walsh's eyes bulge. The shepherd bares its teeth. Begins a low guttural GROWL. Walsh tries to stand his ground with an intimidating stare, but this is one contest that he won't win. He reaches for the doorknob behind him. Opens it. Bolts inside. The shepherd lunges against the closing door, barking wildly. JONATHAN MARDUKAS, the Duke, appears from the bedroom. DANA MARDUKAS, his wife, follows. The Duke appears almost bookish. Yet, there is an enigmatic quality about him. A man with many facets which are not apparent at first glance.

As the PASSENGERS start to deplane, several HITMEN, scattered about the terminal, scan each face looking for the Duke. As the crowd grows thinner, they exchange puzzled glances. As it becomes apparent Walsh and the Duke are not on this plane, Mosely and his men appear, as if out of nowhere. Perry flashes his I.D. at the Flight Attendant as the Agents board.

With a deafening high-pitched whine, the chopper swings madly out of control. Dorfler drops his jaw. Can't believe it. Walsh grins. The chopper ROARS at them. They hit the deck. ROARS back into the sky and starts its deadly descent toward the wall of the gorge. Heads straight for it. SLAMS into it. EXPLODES into a FIREBALL. GUSHING FLAMES AND SHRAPNEL for a hundred yards.

Walsh punches Dorfler square in the jaw. Dorfler falls back, hitting the car. Walsh digs in Dorfler's pockets. Pulls out Dorfler's cuffs and keys. Cuffs him to the open car door and tosses the keys into the water. Dorfler is coming to.

EXT. RAPIDS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Duke, trying to swim, grabs for debris lodged between rocks. Stops. Unsurvivable white-water ROARS just ahead. Holding onto the debris for dear life, he pulls himself along. Slowly. Surely. Inches toward a boulder. Walsh comes bouncing down the rapids on the same path that the Duke has just taken. He sees the Duke pulling himself to safety. Walsh reaches out as he passes. Grabs for the same debris. SLAMS into it. Dislodges all of it. He and the Duke ROAR down the rapids together clinging to the same log. Moving into the white- water.
</DIRECTION>

	Goddamnit, I was almost safe!

<DIRECTION>
They ride the log, holding on for dear life. A group of boulders are ahead. Water RUSHES between them. The log slams into the boulders, getting caught between two of them. Duke's back is against the current. Walsh is on the other side of the log. He's losing his grip. The rapids beyond invite death.

The middle of nowhere. Chickens scatter avoiding the pickup truck as it pulls up to a dilapidated general store. The Indians pile out. Other Indians sit on indoor furniture that has been left outside. An old crop duster is parked to one side of the general store. It catches the Duke's eye.

<DIRECTION>
The Duke disappears inside. Walsh studies the lonely landscape of old cars and shacks. In their native language, a few INDIANS sitting nearby are having a good laugh at the expense of Walsh's bedraggled appearance. Walsh does his best to ignore them. The sound of a large engine coming to life fills the air. Walsh, pacing along the porch, casually glances in the direction of the crop duster as it slowly starts to taxi away. His eyes widen as he realizes that the man in the open cockpit is the Duke. It appears that the Duke is not afraid of flying. The prop spins with life. The SOUND of the crop duster intensifies. Walsh can't believe how badly he's been taken. As the crop duster moves away, Walsh goes berserk.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Fear of flying, you son of a bitch?

Walsh runs after the plane, sprinting the length of the reservation to catch up with the taxiing plane. The Duke swings it around for takeoff, now moving toward Walsh. As it moves past him, Walsh grabs onto the wing and hoists himself alongside the cockpit. The plane ROARS with life. He reaches for the Duke. The Duke tries to push Walsh off and maintain control at the same time.

Walsh right-hooks the Duke, knocking him out, then manages to yank him from the cockpit. They both fall to the ground. The pilotless crop duster aimlessly taxis in circles. Indians come running from every direction. Walsh shoves the Duke back toward the general store. Indians surround them angrily. SHOUTING. Walsh pulls out his .45. Points it in every direction. It gets quiet fast.

Walsh is crouched in the open doorway, smoking. Looking at the sun. He flicks his cigarette butt into the wind. Walsh turns. Notices that the Duke is setting up his breakfast. He tears open the paper bag. Uses it as a place mat. Lays out fruit. A box of high-fiber cereal. A quart of nonfat milk.

	You don't know what the fuck you're talking about. The reason I do this shit is because I didn't want to work for that lowlife. You remember that big dealer I was trying to bring down in Chicago? That was Serrano, alright? Now, you know everything. Are you happy?

	He's the reason you left Chicago? And you're taking me in? Are you out of your mind? You want me to speak your language, Jack? You let that motherfucker beat you! With what you know about police work and what I know about Serrano's operation, we should be able to put him away for thirty years.

Walsh tumbles down the embankment to the banks of the creek. He's out cold. Dorfler can be heard SCREECHING away in the car. Walsh is still. The continuous roar of the chopper seems to fade away.

He achingly sits at the counter. The Diner Owner places a mug before Walsh. Pours coffee. Walsh nods his thanks. Picks up the mug. Blows on it gently. Is about to take a sip. SUDDENLY, a pair of sunglasses SLIDES the length of the counter, coming to rest in front of Walsh. He doesn't budge. Just stares at them. He puts down the mug. Picks up the sunglasses. Knows what's coming without looking. He looks anyway. Standing at the end of the counter is Mosely.

<DIRECTION>
Walsh turns and starts walking. He gets a few steps toward the door. He stops. Turns. Looks back at the Duke, who's still standing in the terminal. Walsh starts walking back to him with a smile. He takes the Duke's hand. It appears as if he is going to cuff the Duke again. He does. With his battered Timex.

The Duke unbuttons his suit jacket. Walsh squints. He's confused. The Duke unbuttons two buttons on his shirt. Reaches underneath. UNSTRAPS something. Pulls out an odd-looking belt and hands it to Walsh.
</DIRECTION>
<WALSH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALSH>
<THE_DUKE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I thought the FBI was closing in. So I took a little traveling money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
It is a money belt. Walsh takes it slowly. He's slow to understand. He opens a compartment. Thousand dollar bills are stacked tightly.
</DIRECTION>
<WALSH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sonofabitch...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALSH>
<THE_DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</WALSH>
<THE_DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not a payoff, it's a gift. You already let me go.
	</DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
<WALSH>
	<DIALOGUE>

Money belt in hand, Walsh steps outside. Takes in the night air. He walks past a large clock. It reads 11:35.
