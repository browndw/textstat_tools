:SC: EXT. SNOWSCAPE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BLINDING WHITE SCREEN, under which we hear an ominous low end Dolby THX Big Screen rumble. We're not in 19" television land anymore, Toto. As the rumble builds, TWO BLACK FIGURES appear on what now has resolved into a distant horizon. From their movements we can shortly see that the figures are men. Moving along a windswept ice sheet in an otherwise featureless land.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LEGEND appears: NORTH TEXAS, 35,000 B.C.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER ON THE TWO MEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Continuing toward us, we can now see that they are dressed in crude garments made of animal skins. If we squint we can see their hair is long, their jutting foreheads significant of primitive Homo Sapiens. They continue toward us, the wind beating against them, CAMERA IS CRANING DOWN to the snow that lies before them. To LARGE THREE-TOED TRACKS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FOLLOWING THE PRIMITIVES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they track the three-toed prints to a rocky crevice in the hard-pack ice. The prints stop here, and so do the men. Dropping down into the crevice in pursuit of their quarry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. ICE CAVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dark in here, except where the sunlight penetrates the thick, glassy ice walls. The silhouettes of the Primitives stark against the glistening cavern. The sound of flint being struck, then A TORCH CATCHES FIRE, illuminating their faces. And:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CREATURE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Deeper in the cave. Fleeing the light and the men. We get only a brief glimpse of it in the torch light, seeing that it moves upright on two legs and has gray, dinosaur-like skin. And large black eyes. But it moves quickly enough away that any other identifying feature is lost in the deeper shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE PRIMITIVES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Removing crude weapons made of sharpened bone from under their thick fur garments, and scrabbling into the constricting cavern, giving chase.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Following them as they moves with animal-like agility through the tightening space. Predatory hunters. Their torchlight catching:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CREATURE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As it disappears into a tight opening in a smaller crevice leading off the main one. The Primitives entering frame after a moment, only a few steps behind. The LEAD PRIMITIVE dropping to the cave floor, pulling himself into this same tight fissure in pursuit. Splitting off from his partner who exits frame still on the run.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. SMALLER ICE CAVE - HIGH ANGLE DOWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fiery torch comes through first, held by the lead man. Throwing dancing shadows on the walls of what appears to be a box cavern.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON LEAD PRIMITIVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rising quickly to his feet. Not seeing what the torch illuminates just behind him: The face of a dead Primitive Man, his body frozen into the ice. He does finally notice this, turning to see it, when he's ATTACKED VICIOUSLY FROM BEHIND.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The torch falls to the floor so that the fight is difficult to see, but it is loud and cruel. The creature squealing wildly as the grunts of the Primitive now turn to the sounds of painful struggle. Until:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SECOND PRIMITIVE MAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly appears, driving his bone weapon into the body of the Creature. Again and again, until the Creature is driven away into the shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Second Man grabs the torch now, not to see if his hunting mate has survived, but in pursuit of the Creature. In the light we see that he and his weapon are covered with spatters of OILY BLACK BLOOD. As is the First Primitive whose body lies heaving on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Second Primitive stepping over his hunting mate, stalking the Creature into the shadows, where it has collapsed. The torch finally landing, for the first time, on its face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When the torchlight hits its face, the Creature attacks. But the Primitive prevails. He drops his torch and dispatches the already wounded Creature with strong hard stabs of his weapon, one of which penetrates the Creature's eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOW ANGLE ON THE DEAD CREATURE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The torch, which lies on the ground, illuminates the dead creature's face. Its wounds are flowing with the oily black blood, which, oddly now, BEGINS TO POOL. As if it has intelligence, sentience. Pooling and traveling into a fissure in the cave floor. And disappearing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON THE SECOND PRIMITIVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watching this, unknowing. His chest heaving from the fight, as the spots of Oily Black Blood which have spattered onto him begin to crawl. Crawling toward his eyes and mouth. Causing him to let out grunts of fear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Which are the sounds we hear as the CAMERA SLOWLY CRANES UP past the struggling Primitive to the roof of the cave, where the dancing shadows of the torch FADE AWAY with the sounds of struggle. Moving into darkness and silence. But only for a moment. Until:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUNSHINE BREAKS THROUGH THE ROOF OF THE CAVE - PRESENT DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Along with the spade of a shovel. And then -- the earthen cave ceiling gives way and A BOY wearing Nikes and an old t-shirt falls through it. Falling PAST CAMERA. We hear a YELL, then a THUD, and a CLATTERING of the shovel that's fallen in with him. Then a pained GASPING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then SEVERAL HEADS appear in the opening. These are BOYS of ten to eleven, staring down into the cave. Hot sunlight blazing in. We have traveled far, far forward in time.

Stevie has gotten up, moving out of the patch of sunlight. Disappearing from view for a moment. Then reappearing, still spitting out dirt. But holding:
</DIRECTION>
<STEVIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Human skull.

</STEVIE>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE UP ON STEVIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The other boys looking down at him. Stevie looking at the skull. Strangely, the light shines through it. It is milky, opaque, as if it's bone that's turned somehow glassy in places. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<STEVIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyways, there's bones all over the place down here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVIE>
<DIRECTION>
Stevie looks down at his feet. CAMERA FOLLOWING HIS LOOK DOWN to where there are indeed more human bones. And something else. He takes a couple of steps in place, standing in a familiar BLACK, OILY substance -- which is climbing up his tennis shoe from the rock floor, over the edge of the shoe and down into the shoe itself. Then the SKULL drops in the frame, clattering on the hard floor of the cave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA SLOWLY RISING UP FROM STEVIE'S SHOES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Following SUBCUTANEOUS WORMS which have begun locomoting aggressively up his legs. As his whole body is WRACKED by a shivering seizure of some kind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA RISES, following the path of the worms as they move up the legs of his shorts. Some appearing on his bare arms, but the great majority continuing up to Stevie's neck, toward his face. Stevie stands paralyzed. Letting out guttural sounds not dissimilar to when the wind was knocked out of him.

But what they see next answers that question for them.

His face suddenly alive with the subcutaneous worms. Moving toward his eyes which begin filling with BLACK OIL. Looking much now like ALIEN EYES.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. SMALL DIRT FIELD - NORTHERN TEXAS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a dirt hole that was being dug by the three kids. RISING UP out of the hole to REVEAL the parched dirt patch where THREE KIDS are running away from us, as fast as their feet will take them. Toward A NEW HOUSING TRACT (five floorplans to choose from, including the model home.) Disappearing into the neighborhood. A LEGEND appears: NORTH TEXAS, 1998.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA CONTINUES RISING ABOVE THE ROOFTOPS to see the surrounding expanse of empty Texas flatland. And in the distance, the DALLAS SKYLINE.

As CAMERA SETTLES, there are a few moments of nothing but the sound of the wind gently whistling across the landscape. In which we bury a short TIME CUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NORTHERN TEXAS - DAY
</DIRECTION>

Then we HEAR it, before we see it: FIRE ENGINES pulling into the neighborhood, sirens WAILING. CAMERA DROPPING AGAIN as the lead engine pulls up. FIREMEN are hopping off, moving to the hole the boys dug.
</DIRECTION>

LOW ANGLE UP FROM BELOW GROUND LEVEL, IN THE DUGOUT HOLE

CAMERA RISES out of the dirt hole, finds A GROUP OF NEIGHBORS:

Concerned PARENTS, KIDS, including Stevie's friends. They're held at a distance by the remaining firemen. Everyone turning their concerned gazes skyward. Looking at:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MED-EVAC CHOPPER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coming off the sun-setting horizon. Moving toward us at high speed. The WHOP, WHOP of its blade soon shaking the neighborhood as it banks in and around and hovers just over the dirt field. Landing gently on the parched hard scrabble.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The side door flies open and FIVE HAZ-MAT RESCUE PARAMEDICS jump out carrying a bubble litter. CAMERA PANS THEM to the dirt hole past THE FIRE CAPTAIN. The Haz-Mat Paramedics moving down into the hole. The Fire Captain watches this, then stares toward --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DR. BEN BRONSCHWEIG (in shirtsleeves, tie), exiting the chopper, following up the rear. The Captain meeting him in route.

<DIRECTION>
Dr. Bronschweig's focus is elsewhere, though. He's making a bee line to the earthen hole where young Stevie is being pulled out and lifted into an enclosed QUARANTINE BUBBLE LITTER by the rescue squad. Bronschweig watches with great concern. Getting a good look now at Stevie's paralyzed body as it passes him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON CHOPPER

As Stevie's body is loaded aboard, the side door is slid shut. The engine throttles up and the chopper takes flight again, almost as quickly as it arrived. The prop wash blowing:

<DIRECTION>
And the gathering crowd. Bronschweig watches the chopper bank away, then turns his look to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE NEIGHBORHOOD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Where A SERIES OF UNMARKED CARGO VANS, TRUCKS are rolling in. A fleet of vehicles, driven by what looks like MILITARY PERSONNEL. Most conspicuously TWO WHITE UNMARKED TANKER TRUCKS. (There are NO MARKINGS on these vehicles.)

<DIRECTION>
And he moves off toward the approaching trucks where the MILITARY PERSONNEL are pulling out tents, tent poles, scientific equipment. Leaving the Captain to wonder what the hell's going on. Watching the first of many REFRIGERATION UNITS being unloaded. The personnel carrying it paying him no mind as they blow past him. Moving RIGHT TO CAMERA and plunging us into BLACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HOLD. Then OVER BLACK, a familiar sound again. The sound of a chopper auguring in. As we FADE UP, revealing we are:

The chopper is banking over the side of the building, preparing to touch down on the rooftop where FIFTEEN FBI AGENTS in dark ID windbreakers are standing. A LEGEND appears: FEDERAL BUILDING, DALLAS, TEXAS. ONE WEEK LATER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The chopper touches down and, again, the side door is thrown open. But now only one man exits: SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE (S.A.C.) DARIUS MICHAUD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michaud moves with the measured pace of authority, approaching the waiting FBI Agents. One of whom steps up.

This is given as a non-negotiable order, to the somewhat weary FBI man. Who turns back to his charges, Michaud does not register this attitude, though. Something else has caught his attention. Causing him to walk to the edge of the building. CAMERA FOLLOWING HIM, seeing what he sees now.

On an adjacent skyscraper is what appears to be AN FBI AGENT in an ID windbreaker exiting onto the roof. CAMERA CONTINUING AROUND into A CLOSE UP PROFILE of S.A.C Michaud. Staring at this, his jaw set. He doesn't like what he sees. And what he sees is:

	I'm a key figure in an ongoing government charade. An annoyance to my superiors. A joke among my peers. "Spooky," they call me. Spooky Mulder. Whose sister was abducted by aliens when he was a kid. Who now chases little green men with a badge and a gun, shouting to the heavens and anyone who'll listen that the fix is in. That our government's hip to the truth and a part of the conspiracy. That the sky is falling and when it hits it's gonna be the shitstorm of all time.

Mulder appears, moving to the bathroom door. Only to find an OUT OF ORDER sign on it. He moves to the woman's room, but it's locked. Gathering what's left of his wits, Mulder does what any red-blooded man would do in this situation. He goes to the back door of the bar and exits into the alley.

Kurtzweil unzips his own pants now. There is a moment; one of those awkward moments where Mulder's not sure what's about to happen. But Kurtzweil's just relieving himself, too. Shuffling up to the wall, Mulder takes this as an opportunity to head back toward the bar. But Kurtzweil hails him again.

	The Federal Building was too well guarded.

</MULDER>
<KURTZWEIL>

In the shadows there is movement, the creature edging into the light cast from the draped area. We see it is fully formed -- a replica of the Creature we saw at the opening of our story. Though it does not make any kind of aggressive move. As if, newborn, it is tentative.

Bronschweig can be heard, but not clearly seen. He is in the shadows himself now.

Trying to pick himself up, and when he manages to do this, teetering back into the light we see that he is bloodied. He is hurt, injured. Making his way back toward the patch of light that comes from the hole above. Hoping to see that help is on its way, while keeping a watchful, wary and worried eye on the shadows, for another attack by the Creature.

This pronouncement has the power of ending any further questions. An immediate sense of gravity of the situation.

The train, which is not much longer than this, passes. And Mulder and Scully make a mad dash for their car. The lights come on and Mulder swings the vehicle into a hard accelerating turn, taking the spoke of the intersection that parallels the tracks. As the car hauls ass after the train, we:

The Agents are moving off the tracks now, picking their way toward the horizon where, at the edge of the great plateau that lays out before them, there are TWO GIANT GLOWING WHITE DOMES.

It is otherwise pitch dark out, almost giving the impression that the domes are floating.

It would give the distinct impression of otherworldliness, if we hadn't seen a similar, smaller glowing dome over the dirt field where the boys found the skull. And if we could not see the lights of the TRAIN rolling to a stop near the mysterious domes.

Our view is down through the crosswires and cables that create the tension support. The effect is a combination of simplicity and perfect function. Stark and high tech. The flooring is gray and flat, featureless. But we don't yet see from this angle exactly what the white domed tent houses.

Though the air is still and there is no movement of any kind, there is a sound that permeates the interior. A STEADY HUM. Almost electrical hum, but different.

Mulder and Scully move together toward the middle of the space.

Scully's hand slipping from Mulder's as she pulls her jacket up over her head. Mulder doing the same now, ducking his head inside his own jacket. The Agents are slowed by the bees but still make their zigzag way toward the door -- bees clinging to their clothes. But motion seems to be the key.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Mulder RUNS TOWARD CAMERA -- where the downward blast of air knocks all the bees off him. In the b.g., we see that Scully has fallen behind. Still running, but losing her way in the process, losing her bearings as the thickening swarm of bees descends.

When Mulder enters frame, jacket pulled over his head again. Taking Scully by the back of her coat and swinging her toward the direction of the door.

Where BRIGHT BEAMS BLAST ON, moving fast toward them. The RUSHING WHIR of the turbine engines of the unmarked choppers. The bright beams skimming across the ground toward Mulder and Scully, traveling right along the edges of ends of the white domed tents. Threatening to spot the Agents, unless they -- RUN.

Traversing the field, then doing sharp banking turns and swooping back over the field now in low drifting hovers. The wash from the blades knocking the corn stalks down so as to reveal anything hidden within.

As he does this, unbeknownst to the agents ONE OF THE BLACK HELICOPTERS rises up from below the bluff, appearing in their rear windshield. Hovering just behind the car like a giant bumblebee. Just as...

Mulder is getting heated, rough with Kurtzweil. When, unexpectedly A MAN suddenly exits the bathroom. REACTING to this scene. Kurtzweil uses the moment to break from Mulder. Slipping out the back door. Mulder takes a beat, then goes after him.

We get a glimpse of the man who was watching him. A face we recognize as that of the man who brushed past Mulder coming out of the vending room, not long before the building in Dallas blew. He is moving quickly now, disappearing into the shadows. CAMERA TILTING DOWN to find:

MULDER. He stands staring up, but only for a moment until he turns and hurries off in the opposite direction Kurtzweil disappeared in.

ANGLE OVER MULDER

Finding old pictures of young Fox Mulder with his SISTER, Samantha. With his father and mother. The plastic-covered page is peeled back and one of these photos is removed. It is an old family snapshot. A picnic possibly.

Mulder stares at the picture.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT PHOTO - In the b.g. of the picnic, his head turned to camera, is a young KURTZWEIL.

Mulder studies the photo intensely, when there's a KNOCK at his door. Mulder turning to see:

SCULLY

In his haste, Mulder had neglected to lock his door. Scully is pushing it open. She's still in the same clothes. She looks beat. Her eyes meeting Mulder's. A gaze that says bad news.

She is silent, moved. In spite of all her desire not to be. She moves to Mulder, holds him. They break slightly and she looks up at Mulder with deep respect, admiration and... kisses him on the forehead. When...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...suddenly a physical intimacy we've never seen. A heat and passion that can't be denied. The opportunity for the inevitable has presented itself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The moment of truth has arrived. Mulder is staring at Scully as she's looking back at him. His head moves slightly toward hers -- as one of his hands moves up to her neck, drawing her to him. Where there is hesitation on her part, there is also desire. When:

Kurtzweil is thrown by the words, and the delivery. Stopping his backward progress. Studying this upright and civil man.

On this note, Kurtzweil turns and hoofs it back in the direction from which he came. TRACKING BACK WITH HIM until HEADLIGHTS hit his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A TOWN CAR has pulled into the alley behind him. Accelerating fast down the narrow corridor. Effectively trapping Kurtzweil in. As he squints into its headlights, then turns back with fear in his eyes to the W.M.M.

Moderately crowded as Mulder enters, stopping to catch his breath. Moving to the back of the bar. Looking for:

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's empty.

Mulder passing the bathrooms, moving to the door where we saw the Well-Manicured Man standing just a short bit ago. But there is no one back here now. Mulder moves to the back door, the one leading to the alley, pushing it open and finding:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Well-Manicured Man stands with HIS DRIVER closing the trunk on the idling Town Car (which has been turned around.) The W.M.M. turns to see:

	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to know where Scully is.

The Well-Manicured Man suddenly reaches into his jacket pocket, without warning or explanation. Mulder tensing slightly. He removes a thin felt envelope.
</DIRECTION>
<WELL_MANICURED_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The location of Agent Scully. And the means to save her life.

</WELL_MANICURED_MAN>

He gestures toward the car where the Driver stands with the back door open. Mulder hesitates, then steps from the doorway. Moving past the W.M.M., sliding in. The W.M.M. gets in after him, closes the door. The car pulls away.

	<DIALOGUE>
	A virus?

<WELL_MANICURED_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A simple, unstoppable lifeform. What is a virus but a colonizing force that cannot be defeated? Living in a cave, underground, until it mutates. And attacks.

	What do you mean, walked?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULDER>
<WELL_MANICURED_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your aliens, Agent Mulder, your little green men, first landed here millions of years ago. Those that didn't leave have been laying dormant underground since the last Ice Age. In the form of an evolved pathogen. Waiting to be reconstituted when the alien race from which it came returns to colonize the planet. Using us as hosts. Against this we have no defense. Nothing but a weak vaccine.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you see why it was kept secret? Why even the best men -- men like your father -- could not let the truth be known?

</WELL_MANICURED_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
The force and conviction of his delivery leave Mulder shaken.
</DIRECTION>
<WELL_MANICURED_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Until Dallas, we believed the virus was simply a controlling organism. That mass infection would make us a slave race.

	<DIALOGUE>
	That's why you bombed the building. The infected firemen, the boy --

</MULDER>
<WELL_MANICURED_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Imagine our surprise when they began to gestate. My group has been working cooperatively with the alien colonists, facilitating their programs. To give us access to the virus. In false hope we might be able to secretly find a cure. So that we might save ourselves, as the last of the species.

	But... he sacrificed his own daughter. My sister, Samantha.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULDER>
<WELL_MANICURED_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The only true survivors of the viral holocaust will be those immune to it: those vaccinated against it and human/alien hybrids. Your father arranged for your sister's abduction. He allowed her to be taken to an alien hybrid program, so that she would survive. As a clone.

Mulder sits stunned by this. As if somehow his destiny has been validated, if not pre-ordained. Or maybe just justified.

Mulder reaching to this as the limo pulls to a stop. Trying the door, but the door is locked. When he turns back to the W.M.M. he has produced a handgun, which is now pointing at Mulder. Laid casually across a folded arm. Mulder reacts on seeing it.
</DIRECTION>
<WELL_MANICURED_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The men I work with will stop at nothing to clear the way for what they believe is their stake in the inevitable future. I was ordered to kill Kurtzweil. A necessary action to protect my grandchildren's lives.

Mulder is recoiling as he says this. Then, without hesitation in one quick move, he SHOOTS the Driver in the head.

The blood spattering on the front windshield -- and on Mulder who has barely had a chance to react.

</WELL_MANICURED_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Mulder looks at The Well-Manicured Man, expecting to be next. And for a moment, we do too. But the W.M.M. simply opens the door and steps out of the car. Holding the door open for Mulder who is still frozen by the actions that went just before.

</WELL_MANICURED_MAN>

And Mulder does. Moving away from the car, looking back over his shoulder. As the Well-Manicured Man gets back into the limousine, closes the door. A moment later... THE CAR EXPLODES INTO FLAMES, knocking Mulder to the ground.

ANGLE ON MULDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The felt envelope has been jarred from his grasp. Its contents loosed from inside: a piece of paper with COORDINATES on it and an AMPULE and SYRINGE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mulder gets up, looks back. Then he picks up the envelope and its contents -- and begins to run. Running as fast as he can go. Until, far down the block, he disappears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the SCREEN DISSOLVES TO WHITENESS -- under which we hear an ominous low end Dolby THX Big Screen rumble. The same sound that opened our story.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then there is movement, as the curvilinear line of a horizon becomes visible, bi-secting the screen between the white of the earth and the white of the sky. We are:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. POLE OF INACCESSIBILITY - ANTARCTICA

Across the expanse of whiteness, a DARK IMAGE appears on the long flat horizon. Moving toward us. As a LEGEND appears, to establish.

CLOSER ON A SNOW TRACTOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Crawling across the harsh frozen land like a domed insect.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. SNOW TRACTOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Agent Mulder sits behind the controls of the enclosed cabin, several days growth on his face. Dressed in thick, bundled outerwear. He maneuvers the vehicle to a stop. Reaching for a handheld GPS monitor to check his position. Catching his breath for a moment -- all movement is exertion in this climate. Mulder stares hard out the front window, the wipers beating time, but there is nothing out there but whiteness. He wipes the fog from a side window with his gloved hand, seeing nothing but more whiteness. Checking the GPS device again, then reaching for the door latch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RESUME WIDE EXTERIOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Agent Mulder exits the vehicle, hopping down onto the snowscape crust. Setting out on foot with the GPS device held before him. In this forbidding environment he might as well be taking a space walk -- without the security of a lifeline. Which is the impression we get as his tiny figure trudges across the ice, increasing the distance between himself and the snow tractor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVING WITH MULDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Up a gentle grade, the snow tractor now behind him. Moving into tight f.g. where he stops, seeing something now which allows him to pocket the GPS device. Dropping instinctively to his knees, so as to avoid being seen by:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MULDER'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the distance is an ICE STATION. A row of interconnecting WHITE DOME TENTS, whose design is now familiar to us. There are what look like snow tractors and other snow vehicles parked alongside the structures.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RESUME MULDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pulling a compact pair of binoculars from one of his deep jacket pockets. Training them on:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE ICE STATION - BINO MATTE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PANNING across the domes and vehicles, where there is no sign of personnel -- until MULDER PANS off the building, finding in his field glasses AN APPROACHING SNOW TRACTOR. Moving across the landscape toward the ice station. When it pulls to a stop, A MAN exits out of one of the domes: THE CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN. Moving to the vehicle and getting in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The vehicle reverses now, transporting the CSM back away from the ice station.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON MULDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Taking the field glasses away from his eyes. The excitement he feels expressed now in his breathing, which has become harder and shallower. Mulder rises, beginning to move the still great distance between himself and the ice station.

:SC: INT. SNOW ICE BUBBLE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Where Mulder's body falls through a ceiling of snowscape crust, landing on his back with a THUD on a hard surface. It takes him a moment to catch his breath, somewhat reminiscent of Stevie at the beginning of the picture. Wincing through the pain. Until he turns over, regaining his wits, and his bearings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mulder has fallen on a hard, narrow metallic structure. Its dull black color a stark contrast to the white ice it's encased in. The bubble has been created by air coming out of vents in the structure, carving out corresponding patterns in the ceiling; softening the ice and snow above.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER ON MULDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
rising to his knees, the AIR from one of these vents blowing onto his face. Pulling off the hood of his jacket, looking deep into the vent which is open, ungrated.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And big enough for a man to crawl into. Which, after considering the hole he's fallen through high above him, is really Mulder's only choice.

It is dark in here, the features of the corridor ill-defined.

Mulder pulls a flashlight from a pocket in his parka, snicks it on. Its beam reflecting off tall frozen liths of ice regularly spaced on both sides of the corridor.

NEW ANGLE ON MULDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Training the light down the corridor, which curves away in both directions. Then pointing it at something right in front of his nose: something that gives him a start.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reaching up with his hand to brush away frost from the lith. Finding A MAN FROZEN IN ICE. Naked, his eyes staring into some long-forgotten distance. His hair is dark, his flat features familiar to us. He is the prehistoric hunter from the opening scenes of the movie. His flesh has the opaque, see-through quality that we've seen before. Inside of which, frozen along with the man, is an EMBRYONIC CREATURE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE ON MULDER

Reacting to this sight, then moving off down the corridor, his pace quickened.

Mulder's snow tractor, where the first tractor stops, its headlights trained on Mulder's ride.

A beat, then the discovering machine moves out again, following the tracks that Mulder has left, which brings it STRAIGHT TOWARD CAMERA. As it passes us, we can see the DRIVER and the Cigarette Smoking Man sitting in the cabin. As we:

Mulder has to drop down to his knees to see into the openings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE FROM OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE BALCONY PASSAGEWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Where Mulder is seen looking TOWARD CAMERA. The Balcony passageway is short. Mulder drops to his stomach again, pulling himself through, toward us. When he reaches the opposite end, Mulder pokes his head out, looking up in wonder at:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. CENTRAL THEATER - BALCONY - CONTINUOUS - WIDE ON A STADIUM-SIZED DOME -- (CGI SET EXTENSION)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Imagine a domed sports arena -- this is the scope and scale of the space that Mulder has penetrated. We see him as only a small speck on a balcony midway between floor and ceiling. Pulling himself out of the balcony passageway, which is like countless other passageways. Which are actually ventilation ports.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE OVER MULDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pulling himself to his feet. Beholding the space before him. Looking down to the center floor where a large central theater gives off a light different from elsewhere in the dome. An icy, bright glow. Leading down to the central theater far below are several LARGE TUBULAR SPOKES. (One of which leads up right next to Mulder's position.)

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reacting to this. Then something captures his attention.

Mulder begins to creep down TOWARD CAMERA, picking his way around the empty cryopods.

REVERSE ON THIS CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Where Mulder is walking past frozen CRYOPODS hanging on a track. Each icy pod containing a HUMAN BODY frozen within. Partially visible behind clear blue ice. But these are modern men, and women. Their expressions a confused horror, as if they have been somehow frozen alive. They are slowly tracking.
</DIRECTION>

Walking along the slowly moving carousel of frozen humanity. Stopping, turning, almost as if having sensed:

PUSHING IN ON MULDER'S FACE. Recording the horror and fear he's experiencing, on seeing:
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Where a woman's body is encased, its naked features hidden behind the opacity of the newly frozen blue crust. But whose face is unmistakable as that of Agent Scully's. Frozen in a similar expression of far-away horror, her eyes cast slightly heavenward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MULDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
hurries to get his jacket unzipped. Removing the FELT ENVELOPE, removing the syringe body, the needle and the AMPULE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hastily putting the syringe together, getting the needle poked into the soft rubber cap of the ampule. Bleeding the syringe now, the substance inside squirting out of the end of the needle onto the floor of the ship.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And the moment it does, the whole floor SIZZLES like water being dropped onto a hot skillet. Spreading out from Mulder in every direction. A VIOLENT CHEMICAL REACTION, as predicted by the man who gave him this substance. A moment later the entire structure Mulder is in SHUNTS. Shuddering violently and setting up a low-end RUMBLE. Causing Mulder to accidentally drop the syringe.

We can hear low end rumble and vibration. TWO DOZEN MEN are streaming out of the dome tents. Moving to their carious snow tractors and starting the vehicles.

<DIRECTION>
A small exodus, the tractors pulling out of camp in a rush. Heading off in various directions.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA FINDING THE CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN moving to his tractor, with THE MAN WHO SHOT MULDER. Taking the last drag of his cigarette before throwing it into the snow. He stares down at it a moment, as if caught in the grip of some emotion conflicting with duty.

The Man who shot Mulder inside the tractor now, throwing open the door for the CSM.

Back on his feet, SMASHING now at the crust of brittle blue-ice that encases Scully. BASHING, SMASHING and then finally breaking through the hard outer later, its inner slushy contents spilling out of the puncture that exposes Scully's face and shoulder. Watery aqua-tinted liquid drains from her mouth and nose. But Scully is not conscious, and there is no indication she is even alive, her face frozen in a blank, almost beatific expression.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OVER MULDER TO SCULLY

	Breathe -- can you breathe?!

Scully is straining to do just that -- when liquid suddenly SPEWS from Scully's mouth. And she begins to cough and gag -- taking big gulps of air as her eyes focus on Mulder as if on a phantom, or a miracle.

Finally faint words ushering forth, whispering breaths that Mulder cannot discern.

Frozen in his icy pod, the hard semi-translucent surface of which is now etched with small streams of water running to the floor. Everything is melting and in motion.

Mulder pushing Scully up, though she seems to have at least some limited ability to do this on her own. The DEEP, LOW RUMBLE we heard in the open frames of the movie reaching full volume now.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The corridor is filled with heavy condensed mist now as Mulder finally slips out of the low passageway, trying to get his bearing now as he huddles low over Scully. Turning his attention to her as she COUGHS HOARSELY -- in some kind of acute spasm of pain -- but alive.

Falling now from Mulder's grasps as her legs buckle and she goes down.

Mulder cannot find a pulse. Scully straining harder now as Mulder reaches his fingers into her mouth, clearing her passageway. Moving on top of her now, and pumping forcefully on her chest -- trying to get air into her. One - two - three.

And putting his mouth down to hers (FINALLY!), breathing his life into her. Pulling away from her to see that he is unsuccessful at this -- that Scully is continuing to strain. Pumping her chest again --

His hands going to a pocket on the inside of the jacket Scully is wearing -- his jacket -- finding again the syringe that he used on Scully. It is still partially full of vaccine. Mulder finding this, getting ready to use it when --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Scully's body suddenly comes back to life beneath him. Labored breaths which turn into a coughing spasm. Mulder breaths relievedly for a moment, watching Scully coughing, coming back to life. Her eyes trying to focus on him, finding him. Seeing his labored relief. The panic melting away.

MULDER'S POV DOWN RIBBED CORRIDOR

Through the condensed mist he can see CREATURES BEGINNING TO HATCH, sprouting from the melted ice-encased bodies they have gestated in. Their THREE FINGERED HANDS beating at the soft ice. Their powerful feet kicking at it, too.

<DIRECTION>
Lifting Scully up with all his strength he has left in him. He's got to get her overhead now, back up the venting that he slipped down from. She is weak and of little help.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mulder gets her propped up on his strength so that he can use the power of his legs to boost her toward the opening. Which puts him face to face with THE EMBRYONIC CREATURE. Its eye looking directly at him, blinking, before it goes into another FITFUL SPASM inside its host body.

Pushing Scully up the last little way. Then reaching up to find a handhold for himself. Grabbing hold and lifting himself as one of his feet kicks at the ice -- where the creature he was just face to face with BURSTS from its icy pod. One hand, then the other shooting out of the ice where they have broken through the host. Ripping open the front of the body, including the man's face. Making a slimy, gaping tear in what was formerly flesh.

Its hands grabbing at Mulder as he thrashes to free himself from it getting a grip.

Scully's head and arms push up through the vent where Mulder first entered. The ice and snow surrounding it, which had created the bubble structure, have melted and fallen. So that above Scully's larger hole has opened up to the surface. The air is full of condensation, swirling around them.
</DIRECTION>

ANGLE FROM ABOVE - THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE ICE

Where, through the swirling steam we see Mulder push Scully clear of the vent. Climbing free himself now. When the surface they are upon SHUDDERS AND QUAKES. As if it has come unloosed, destabilized.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And with this comes A MIGHTY FORCE OF STEAM from the vent Mulder and Scully just crawled from. Blasting up past them with terrible HISSING FORCE. Causing Mulder to throw Scully away from its superheated energy.

Pulling her to the surface of the ice sheet where behind them in the distance the ICE STATION can be seen through the atmosphere of condensed air. When suddenly the ice beneath it gives way and the ice station falls away, caving in to the center of the radius. Which is what begins to happen to the rest of the ice sheet that spreads out to where Mulder and Scully are standing. Causing Mulder to realize:

The radial edge of the falling snow continuing only a few feet beyond where they disappeared. The violent upheaval of snow abating but slightly. Beat, beat...

The ship continues up into the Antarctic sky where it rises toward the sky where it begins to get WHITEHOT. Transforming itself into pure energy. It is visible for several moments during transformation. Then it disappears completely. As it does the RUMBLE, which dopplers across the white, barren landscape. Then it is gone.

Watches this then lays his head down on Scully's back. He is spent, at the brink of complete exhaustion. His whole body heaving. But now starting to shiver, and to lose consciousness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scully's body is motionless beneath him, for a moment we might believe that this is the way it might end. Out here on the ice with Mulder and Scully freezing to death. A chill wind blows off the Antarctic plain, the same LOW RUMBLE, the only taint of silence in vastness of this literal end of the world.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then Scully coughs -- the same hoarse cough. She's alive. Struggling to consciousness. Her head lifting slightly, TURNING TO CAMERA. Her eyes blink open and she coughs again. Feeling Mulder's weight on top of her, unaware of his condition or even where she is.

:SC: EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are JUST ABOVE THE TREETOPS. The Capitol Dome is in the far distance. CAMERA CRANING DOWN to find Mulder sitting by himself on a park bench. We are WIDE. There is no one else around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Until the Cigarette Smoking Man appears. Walking through the otherwise deserted park. Joining Mulder on the park bench.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER ON MULDER, THE CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They do not speak for several moments. A quite tension as the CSM lights up a trademark smoke. Inhaling, exhaling. Then:

<CIGARETTE_SMOKING_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Congratulations on your survival. Your life is worthless now, I hope you know that.

<MULDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And yours?

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think you've stopped it. What I've worked for fifty years to create. You haven't stopped it. You can't stop it.

	<DIALOGUE>
	You're just one man.

	You're wrong.

WIDE ANGLE

<DIRECTION>
Mulder rises from the bench heading TOWARD CAMERA. The CSM rising, watching him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Mulder continues toward us. ADJUST TO REVEAL Agent Scully in the f.g. Mulder moving to her as the CSM watches from the distance. Their eyes meet, an unspoken restored bond exchanged in this moment. Before Mulder takes Scully by the arm, leads her off. Leaving the CSM standing alone in the distance. As we:

:SC: EXT. CORN FIELDS/WHITE DOMES - TUNISIA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRACKING LOW WITH A PAIR OF FEET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wearer of them sporting peasant sandals. We realize shortly that while the feet are moving across sandy ground, that the foliage in the near b.g. is corn. And that the person we are tracking with is passing row after row of stalks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA RISING AS IT TRACKS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVEALING A TUNISIAN MAN dressed in peasant clothes. He is carrying a piece of paper. Moving with hasty purpose. Stopping at the end of one of the long rows of corn where CONRAD STRUGHOLD is coming toward him. Making his way between rows of stalks. The Peasant waits patiently as Strughold approaches, handing him the piece of paper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Strughold reads it, his otherwise steely countenance reflecting a disturbance seen only in the slight narrowing of his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up at the Peasant and says something to him in Tunisian Arabic. Said as command, which causes the Peasant to nod dutifully and move off as he came.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Strughold stands for a moment, then crumples the paper slightly and drops it. Moving off down the same corn row in which he approached.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA DROPPING TO THE GROUND where we find the paper on which we see a flat section that is not so crumpled we cannot read the words: X-FILES RE-OPENED. STOP. PLEASE ADVISE. STOP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA RISING NOW. Rising up past the stalks. Where we can still see Strughold walking. RISING UP AND UP to reveal ACRES AND ACRES OF CORN. Many times more than we had seen previously. Stretched out across the Tunisian Desert, ending only where THREE WHITE DOMES stand on the distant horizon.

Off this image we FADE OUT.
