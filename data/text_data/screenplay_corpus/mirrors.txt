INT. NIGHT - HARLEM SUBWAY STATION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A subway screeches by at full speed revealing a station platform somewhere in Harlem.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A man runs for his life in the deserted space. He's an African American male in his forties wearing a security guard uniform.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns into an empty corridor, climbs a set of stairs towards the exit, but- The gates are down and the station is closed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Desperate and out of breath, he is forced to trace his way back, searching for an exit or a place to hide. He sees a door to the public restroom and runs inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NIGHT - SUBWAY PUBLIC RESTROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The place is deserted as well. One of the mirrors is smashed while the others are covered by graffiti and dirt -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The neon lights are flickering, bringing the place in and out of the dark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man checks each stall one at a time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His face lights up as he looks inside the last one-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SMALL WINDOW ABOVE THE TOILET IS JUST BIG ENOUGH FOR HIM TO CRAWL THROUGH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He steps onto the toilet seat but the window is shut too tight. After a brief struggle, he swings it open, only to discover-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A wall of bricks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Panic returns to his eyes. He slowly opens the stall door, fearful of what could be waiting outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FAINT SOUND OF SHATTERING GLASS is heard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He quickly shuts the door, holding his breath. Frozen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His heart racing, he exits the stall in the direction of the sound. The place is empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is revealed by flashes of flickering neon lights.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He moves closer to the sinks and the spiderweb cracked mirror. His image is fragmented and deformed. It resembles a Cubist portrait.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry... I... I... I wasn't trying to get away...

</MAN>

He talks to his own reflection in the mirror-

	<DIALOGUE>
	No, please don't...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<DIRECTION>
He approaches and starts crying like a child. His head resting against the mirror, he pleads for his life. Then, seeing the dirt and grime on the mirror, his behaving shifts to another extreme. He starts cleaning it frantically with his hands. Too frantically-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A piece of the spiderweb cracked mirror falls on the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Immediately, he bends down to pick it up but-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS REFLECTION IN THE MIRROR REMAINS STANDING IN SILENCE, WATCHING HIM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looking up, the man realizes his reflection has become independent. A separate being...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Terrified, he slowly stands staring at his stationary double.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pointy and sharp piece of broken mirror in his hand reflects the neon lights just like a knife blade.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes turn cold with fear when-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS DOUBLE IN THE MIRROR STABS ITSELF DEEP IN ITS THROAT!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN REALITY, THE MAN HAS NOT MOVED AN INCH, YET HIS THROAT RIPS OPEN, RELEASING A RIVER OF BLOOD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Void of any facial expression, the man's reflection slices his jugular from end to end.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In reality, the man chokes on his own blood which splatters on the mirror- TURNING THE IMAGE TO A DARK DEEP RED.

<DIRECTION>
OPENING CREDITS ON-

All the reflections catch in the glass buildings of Manhattan-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The traffic in the streets, the old turn-of-the-century façades, the people walking on the sidewalk, the pigeons flying away, the Brooklyn Bridge and the Manhattan skyline reflecting off the surface of the Hudson River...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seen through the mirrored surfaces, everything in the city seems to move in a distorted way. Ominous.
</DIRECTION>

The softness of the sun's rising light is contrasted with the eerie, haunting music.

Bip. Bip. Bip...

It's 8 a.m. The blinking digital numbers of the alarm clock reflect off the wooden floor of the apartment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sunlight is diffused through the drawn curtains of the living room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seen in the reflection of the TV-set, a man is sleeping on the couch. He switches off the alarm and rises to go into the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BATHROOM - CONTINUITY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Like a thick fog, the steam from the shower fills the bathroom. The shower turns off. A hand reaches out to wipe away the mist on the mirror above the sink, revealing-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The face of BEN CARSON, 41 years old. His eyes reflect the hardships of life. A life, that from the lines on his face, we suspect hasn't been easy. On his chest and shoulder, SEVERAL BULLET SCARS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben changes his razor blade and starts to shave his 3 day old stubble.

Ben finishes getting dressed and walks to the half opened bedroom door.

	If it was up to me, I would bring you back tomorrow, but I'm not the only one who decides. Listen, I think I've got something else for you. I know a guy at the Mayflower corporation and they need someone to watch over one of their department stores.

<DIRECTION>
We discover a whole different world-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the sterile environment of the NYC Chief Medical Examiner's Office, forensic scientists with tape recorders in hand, describe the corpses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are a world away from the Hollywood clichés of neatly laid out, immaculate cadavers. Here, some of the corpses have reached a state of advanced decomposition and others are still frozen in contorted positions, expressing their ultimate agony before dying. From the homeless man fished out of the river, to the woman killed by gun shots, each corpse tells his own story...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amidst the group of doctors 35-year-old AMY, deeply immersed in an autopsy, is interrupted by her cell phone.

Amy checks the display for the incoming call- BEN. She hesitates for a moment and doesn't answer the call.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Amy, it's me... I just wanted to let you know that I got a job today... It's nothing special, just a security guard job... If you still want to go ahead with it, we can sign the divorce papers... I mean, if that's what you really want.

EXT. DAY - MAYFLOWER DEPARTMENT STORE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On 38th Street, just off of Broadway, the Mayflower has withstood the passage of time and the huge fire that forced it to shut down-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The damage from the fire is still noticeable on the facade of the building-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fire appears to have started on the ground floor and seems to have spread all the way up to the top. Some of the windows are shattered, while others are boarded up. What was once an impressive ornate building, a fine example of 1920's architecture standing on one of Manhattan's most dynamic streets, now gives off a feeling of devastation and desolation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
What is left of it is a mere ruin, a sort of neglected ghost ship, abandoned in the heart of the city.

INT. DAY - MAYFLOWER

The last beams of daylight shine through the broken windowpanes.

Inside the department store, everything has remained the same since the fire, as if time stood still. The display cases, the departments, the mannequins, and even the clothes are all burnt or blackened by the fire. A thick coat of soot covers the floor and rainwater drips down all over the place.

Ben follows Lorenzo through the burnt display counters. He listens but his mind has drifted elsewhere. This place makes him uncomfortable. It's not only the lingering smell of a fire, but also a sense of death that hangs over it.

	Thank God you didn't show up any later. This place gives me the chills at night. ... No electricity, and all these mirrors... You know, I live in Brooklyn near a Jewish neighborhood, and when someone dies, they cover all the mirrors in their house. Some say that it's just to renounce all vanity during the mourning period, but others say something else... They say it's to keep the soul of the dead from being trapped in the mirrors... Believe it or not, there's always a bit of truth in any superstition. Am I right?

Amused and skeptical at the same time, Ben contemplates the mirrors that surround him-

	No idea. Just didn't show up one night. I take it he's found a better opportunity somewhere else. I'm not one to complain, but I never really liked him much... Could never be bothered to say hello or at least ask "how are you doing?"... I mean, damn, do we work together as a team or what?! You, on the other hand, seem like a nice guy. How long has it been since you left the NYPD?

In the Men's department, Ben's flashlight is a mere luminous spot twirling in the night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ever-present mirrors magnify the space to infinity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- THIRD FLOOR -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben walks through the different sections of the Ladies' department. He examines the remains of the charred garments sagging on the hangers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The silhouettes of the burnt mannequins emerge in the gloom of the night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STRANGE AND DISTURBING SHAPES REFLECT OFF THE MIRRORS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NIGHT - MAYFLOWER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wide exterior shot-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
By night, the department store's ornate facade takes on an entirely different appearance - more menacing, almost evil.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NIGHT - MAYFLOWER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben continues his rounds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We follow his path through reflections in the mirrors-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AS IF HE WAS BEING WATCHED...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For the first time, we discover another perspective, another POV FROM WITHIN THE MIRRORS. It feels ominous, slightly detached. The sound is muted.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben crosses back the third floor-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The second floor...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- ENTRANCE HALL GROUND FLOOR -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the reflection of one of the grand mirrors in the entrance hall, we see Ben come down the stairs. He stops for a moment, facing his reflection in the mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He fixes his collar and looks at himself in his new clothes- Not quite an NYPD uniform...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, his eyes freeze. Intrigued, he comes closer to the mirror and leans forward-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HANDPRINT, BARELY VISIBLE, ON THE ICE COLD SURFACE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He touches it with the tip of his fingers and tries to rub it off, unsuccessfully. He picks up a rag from the ground, spits on the mirror, and rubs the mark fervently. The print remains. This confirms his hunch-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE HANDPRINT IS INSIDE THE MIRROR...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
By angling the flashlight, another handprint is revealed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another. And yet another-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE ENTIRE MIRROR IS COVERED WITH HANDPRINTS, JUST AS IF A CROWD OF PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE HAD PRESSED ITSELF AGAINST THE GLASS TO GET OUT...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he looks back up in the mirror he sees- THE ACCESS DOOR TO THE BASEMENT OPENING...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben turns around. His gaze freezes- THE ACCESS DOOR TO THE BASEMENT IS CLOSED!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
YET, IN THE MIRROR, IT CONTINUES TO SLOWLY SCREECH OPEN!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben swings his head back and forth, between the shut door in reality and the opened door in the mirror. What is happening? Is he dreaming or hallucinating?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben walks backwards towards the basement door, keeping his eyes fixed on the mirror. As he goes to reach for the handle, he sees his reflection reaching for the handle of an invisible door!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben opens it-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SYNCHRONICITY BETWEEN THE REAL WORLD AND THE ONE REFLECTED IN THE MIRROR HAS BEEN RESTORED. Ben tries to reenact the phenomenon. He opens and closes the door over and over, while observing his reflection, but the mirror is no longer deceitful.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The staircase leading to the basement vanishes into the dark. Ben hesitates.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NIGHT - BASEMENT CORRIDOR MAYFLOWER - CONTINUITY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben walks down the stairs, step-by-step, lighting his way with a flashlight. The beam of light dims, the battery is almost dead. He gives it a few taps to make the light reappear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Last step-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS FOOT LANDS IN WATER!
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
A few inches of water cover the basement floor. One of the water pipes must have burst due to the cold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The light flickers back for a moment, revealing before him- the narrow subterranean corridors of the department store.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Along a wall, Ben finds a fuse box and pushes some of the switches. Further down in the corridor, a couple of fluorescent lights flicker to life- two tiny sources deep inside the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AS BEN DISCOVERS HIS SURROUNDINGS, THE CAMERA PULLS BACK SLOWLY, UP ALONG THE STAIRS, THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR, IT ACCELERATES AND STOPS IN FRONT OF THE MIRROR-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE REFLECTION, WE SEE THE BASEMENT DOOR SHUT...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO BLACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DAY - NEW JERSEY STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's been snowing all day and a white coat of powder outlines the trees and houses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the front lawn of their house, 5 year old MICHAEL and 7 year old DAISY are building a snowman.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why did they say on TV that it wasn't supposed to snow today, but tomorrow instead? Why did they lie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DAISY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sometimes they make mistakes, Michael. It happens...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAISY>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grown-ups don't make mistakes. Only little children do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
Slightly annoyed, the little boy places the eyes on the snowman.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Daisy's face lights up with a big smile when she catches sight of her father's car approaching-
</DIRECTION>
<DAISY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Daddy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAISY>
<DIRECTION>
Michael turns around and sees Ben exiting his 1986 Oldsmobile, with a big wrapped package in his arms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The children abandon their snowman and rush towards their father. Ben takes Michael into his arms-
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing to the wrapped present)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well I don't know, I just found this package hidden behind a tree.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it for me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to his daughter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Daisy, has Michael been a good boy? Does he deserve his birthday present?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
Michael nods.
</DIRECTION>
<DAISY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! Yesterday he finished the whole bag of candy when mom had told him he could only have one piece.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAISY>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not true!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DAISY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes it's true!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAISY>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it's not true... She's lying Daddy. I've been a very good boy, I promise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
They enter the house.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is mom back?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DAISY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not yet. Rosa came to pick us up from school today.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAISY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DAY - HOUSE - CONTINUITY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the kitchen, ROSA, the nanny, is rinsing the dishes from the afternoon snack-
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello Rosa!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<ROSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello Señor Carson. How are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSA>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm good, very good... What time will Amy be back?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<ROSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not before six, Sir...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSA>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OK, I'll wait for her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<ROSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you want me to fix you a snack?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSA>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, thank you. I'll be fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
Ben takes off his coat and joins the kids in the living room. He hands over the present to his son.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Daisy is sitting in the armchair, holding her cat, TIGER, in her arms.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Happy birthday, Michael.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DAISY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Duh, open it stupid!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAISY>
<DIRECTION>
Michael tears away the wrapping paper and discovers a remote control car. The little boy is on cloud nine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- LATER IN THE AFTERNOON -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the front window, we see a Volvo station wagon park in front of the house. Amy gets out of the car, loaded with shopping bags. She enters the house and hands the groceries over to Rosa.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi Rosa... Where are the kids?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<ROSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Upstairs...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(in a low voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...With Señor Ben.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSA>
<DIRECTION>
The expression on Amy's face shifts. Noticeably irritated, she goes up to the second floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael's remote control car drives at full speed down the hallway. Ben shows his children how to operate the remote control while the bathtub fills up. He seems as excited as the kids by the new toy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben turns around to find Amy watching them.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey Amy...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look Mommy, look what Daddy got me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's great, you will have to show me how it works!
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's so fast Mommy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ben, can I talk to you, in private?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
Ben puts down the remote control-
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
<DIRECTION>
(to his kids)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ok kids, it's time for your bath. No fooling around.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
Ben follows Amy into the bedroom. She closes the door behind them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EARLY EVENING- BEDROOM HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amy is not equally pleased to see him- She's beside herself with anger-
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is this? I already asked you not to drop by without calling, didn't I?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do, but you never take my calls!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't need your calls in the middle of the night. I'm better off without them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I haven't had a drink in three months but, then again, how would you know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want to know, Ben. I don't want to hear about it. It's not my problem. You're not my problem. You've done more than enough harm already.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't think people can change?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We are not talking about people, we're talking about you. How many times did you tell me you were gonna change and nothing happened? It only got worse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
Ben moves closer to his ex-wife-
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just give me another chance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles- How many other chances did she already give him? Behind the firmness and intransigence she conveys, we sense Amy is torn. She still loves him as well.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need more time, Ben. Listen, I will never stop you from seeing your children but we have to set up some rules.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
Out of nowhere, Ben hits the wall with his bare fist-
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	WHAT RULES?! IT'S MY SON'S FUCKING BIRTHDAY TODAY! COME ON AMY, WHAT RULE IS GOING TO STOP ME FROM SEEING HIM?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EARLY EVENING - HOUSE BATHROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the bathtub, Daisy and Michael cannot avoid overhearing their parents arguing. In denial, Michael blocks his ears with his hands and lies back under the water...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK IN THE BEDROOM -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amy seems distrustful of Ben, scared of how close he is to the edge. We can see the anger in his eyes...
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at yourself. You're still carrying around so much of that anger.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
He catches a glimpse of his reflection in the mirror- and of the desperate violence in his eyes... Ben steps back.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
<DIRECTION>
(trying to calm down)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, I didn't mean to yell at you... Things could be so different between us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes I know, but it's up to you Ben.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah... Anyway, I wasn't planning on staying. My shift starts in an hour. I'll just kiss them goodbye and then I'm leaving.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
Ben exits the room. Amy is left alone-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the window, she watches Ben exit the house and get into his car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When she turns away, she discovers Michael and Daisy standing outside the bathtub dripping wet in their towels. She smiles, and quickly comes to dry them.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mom?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, honey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is Daddy coming back to live with us?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles gently.

<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know sweetheart. I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DAY - BASEMENT CORRIDOR MAYFLOWER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The beams from the flashlight are reflected in the few inches of water flooding the basement corridor. Since yesterday, the water level has continued to rise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The outline of Ben and Lorenzo's silhouettes appear in the staircase leading to the ground floor-
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I haven't managed to find the source of the leak. My guess is it doesn't come from the store... It must be a municipal pipe that blew with the cold...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<LORENZO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll call the company tomorrow morning and have them come take a look at it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORENZO>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NIGHT- SECURITY GUARD TRAILER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the gas stove, a kettle is whistling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben rummages through the cupboards and the drawers. He finds some instant coffee next to the bottle of Jack Daniels. He briefly hesitates between the coffee and the whisky...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs a cup and pours the boiling water into the instant coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the reflection of the clock, we see Ben watching TV. It is past midnight. Ben gets up and grabs his flashlight- It's time for his rounds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NIGHT - MAYFLOWER CENTRAL HALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the shattered panes of the central dome, we see Ben walking through the store.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Since the mysterious occurrences of the night before, his attitude has changed. He avoids, as much as possible, looking into the mirrors. He is on guard, fearing another supernatural manifestation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shadows, the mannequins, and the shapes in the mirrors are all disturbing and unsettling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Even what remains of the sculptures on the top of the marble columns seems alive in the dark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he crosses the entrance hall, a glint of light catches his attention. Despite himself, he stops and gazes into the mirror-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE FAR END OF THE STORE, ONE OF THE DEPARTMENTS IS IN FULL SWING AND BATHED IN DAYLIGHT! EVERYTHING IS SPOTLESS, AS IF THE FIRE HAD NEVER TAKEN PLACE. CUSTOMERS COME AND GO AS IF NOTHING HAPPENED.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
How is this possible? Ben turns around to see the same spot in the real world- ONLY IT'S IN RUINS...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben glances back at the reflection in the mirror-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The vision of the past prevails. Unable to ignore it, Ben decides to check it out for himself...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben wanders off towards the far end of the store, a landscape of dust and desolation. HIS REFLECTION IN THE MIRROR, ON THE OTHER HAND, HEADS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE "FLASHBACK"-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We follow him in the mirror-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben has left the night behind and enters the "daytime" department. Everything is in perfect order and unspoiled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben continues his journey into the past.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The customers jostle one another while shopping during a big sale. Children run wild in the aisles. Women fight over articles of clothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben stops dead in his tracks when he notices, around his shoes, a transparent liquid spilling out on the floor-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He bends down and dips his fingertips into the liquid- GASOLINE. Gallons of flowing gasoline gradually spreading over the floor of the department store.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben turns around and sees, under the shelving, A HAND LIGHTING A ZIPPO-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lighter falls to the floor in slow motion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The liquid bursts into flame instantly. THE CHEERFUL VISION OF A DAY IN THE DEPARTMENT STORE QUICKLY TURNS INTO A NIGHTMARE-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EVERYTHING IS ENGULFED IN FLAMES. THE CLOTHES, THE MANNEQUINS AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST, THE CROWD! THE AGONIZING SHRIEKS OF PAIN AND PANIC ARE DEAFENING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frightened, Ben steps back-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The flames spread quickly to the escalators where the crowd has rushed to escape death-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HORRIFIC VISIONS OF PEOPLE BURNING ALIVE... INCINERATED FLESH. FACES DISTORTED BY THE PAIN, SKIN MELTING TO THE BONE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the midst of the flames through the heat waves, Ben spots the face of the firestarter- IS IT HIS OWN?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben has no time to react. In a split second, his uniform catches fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Panicked, he attempts to put out the fire with his hands-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE DARK NIGHT SURROUNDED BY THE CHARRED RUINS, BEN QUIVERS DELIRIOUSLY AS HE TRIES TO SMOTHER THE INVISIBLE FLAMES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He comes back to reality-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben catches his breath, trying to come to his senses. What's happening to him? What he just experienced certainly felt real.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
During his panic, the flashlight rolled under one of the counters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben bends down to pick it up. The beam illuminates the ground and throws light on an object a bit further away- A LEATHER WALLET.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stretches out his hand to pick it up. The leather is worn-out but the absence of dust establishes that the wallet has landed there recently. Ben examines the object with the experienced touch of a professional accustomed to handling evidence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Between the collection of cards and scraps of paper, Ben finds a driver's license belonging to- GARY LEWIS, 55 years old, a sturdily built African American man. WE RECOGNIZE THE MAN RUNNING IN THE SUBWAY, AT THE BEGINNING. The name rings a bell for him-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NIGHT - SECURITY GUARD TRAILER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben returns to the trailer and rummages through the closet-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stops when he finds another uniform. A name is embroidered on the shoulder-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AGAIN THE SAME NAME: GARY LEWIS, BEN'S PREDECESSOR, THE MISSING NIGHT WATCHMAN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wallet rests on the table and piques Ben's curiosity. He cannot hold back his police instincts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He finally empties out the contents on the table-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Blockbuster card, restaurant receipts, a driver's license, Phillips' business card from Mayflower, cash and a sheet of paper folded in four-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben unfolds the sheet of paper and sees, written in ink-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ESSEKER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben chews over these seven letters. Is it somebody's name? A place? A code? Initials? He folds it up again and puts everything back, neatly, in the wallet that he stows away in one of the drawers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO BLACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DAY - QUEENS STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A busy street under the subway overpass. We see a neighborhood bar on the corner-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DAY -QUEENS BAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At this time of day the place is deserted. A plasma screen shows a baseball game. A drunk guy is half asleep at the corner table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sitting at the bar, Ben is nervous, tense... He removes the steeped tea bag from his cup.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben stares at himself in the mirror, behind the bottle display shelves. It is not his mirror image that he is observing. His gaze seems to pierce through his own reflection, to dive beyond, into the very depths of his soul.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Angela interrupts, across from him, behind the bar. She works here.
</DIRECTION>
<ANGELA>

	You can't avoid them. They're everywhere...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<ANGELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you talking about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANGELA>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The mirrors... In the department store, at every street corner, in the windows of every fucking building in this city. I feel like I'm not the one looking into the mirrors, but rather they're looking at me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
Angela smiles, not sure if he is serious-
</DIRECTION>
<ANGELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You need a drink.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANGELA>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I'm serious.

</BEN>
<ANGELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you think you're being a little bit paranoid?

Ben observes the palm of his hand.

<ANGELA>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</ANGELA>

Angela smiles at him and continues to polish the drinking glasses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NIGHT - BASEMENT MAYFLOWER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the darkness, a rat glides peacefully on the water surface.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the basement, the water level continues to rise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a flashlight in hand, and his feet submerged in the water, Ben moves deeper into the tunnel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is searching for the source of the leak. The beam of light sweeps across the walls and the piping.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben crosses an intersection. In the corner, on the tiled wall, he barely discerns an old inscription ingrained with decades of dust and dirt. He sinks his hand into the water and wipes it off, revealing an arrow pointing to, ST JOHN'S DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHIATRY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He continues his exploration of the subterranean passageways.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, he notices a darker area on the wall. He comes closer and discovers a brownish damp-spot, covered with mold. The humidity has pearled into droplets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He has found the source of the leak.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His hand brushes the wall, causing it to crumble instantly. Ben digs into the plaster as if it were butter, bringing a cracked water pipe to light. The leakage has damaged the wall in which the tubing was embedded.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben hears the echoing sound of streaming water, as if there were another room on the other side of the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pushes against the saturated wall, and pierces through it with his arm. He removes his arm. For a moment, he observes the gaping black hole that he has just left behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben peeks through the hole with his flashlight, but he cannot make out what is on the other side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He makes the hole bigger, until the passage is large enough for him to crawl through-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE OTHER SIDE, HE DISCOVERS A LARGE BRICK ROOM AND IN THE MIDDLE OF IT ANOTHER ROOM- AN OCTAGONAL ONE WHOSE EACH AND EVERY WALL, INCLUDING THE CEILING, IS MADE OF GIGANTIC TWO WAYS MIRRORS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the mirrors is opened, ajar- It's a door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He enters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His image is reflected in all directions and from infinite angles. Ben moves towards the center of the room-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALTHOUGH THE ROOM SEEMED EMPTY BEFORE, SOMEBODY IS NOW STANDING IN THE CORNER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a well-built man. He too is wearing the blue security guard's uniform.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From where he stands, Ben can only see the back of the man's head. As he moves in closer, he can make out the name embroidered on the man's shoulder-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IT'S GARY LEWIS, THE FORMER NIGHT WATCHMAN!
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gary?

The silhouette remains still.

	Gary?

</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
Ben comes a bit closer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His gaze freezes when he realizes that Gary is not standing in front of the mirror with his face pressed against it, but-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HE IS BEHIND THE MIRROR, INSIDE!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben steps back, terrified.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He doesn't know how to interpret this new phenomenon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben gathers his courage and returns in front of the mirror-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Knock, knock, knock...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He hits the mirror with his fist, as if it were merely a glass window behind which Gary Lewis was standing, on the other side-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No reaction. Ben strikes the mirror harder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Knock, knock, knock...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The former night watchman turns around slowly towards Ben, revealing his face little by little...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

INT. DAY - QUEENS APARTMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Knock, knock, knock...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In his bed, Ben wakes up with a jolt- THE ENCOUNTER WITH GARY WAS A DREAM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Knock, knock, knock...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Somebody is knocking at his door. Ben gets up from the couch-
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Coming...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
Ben opens the door to a UPS deliveryman holding out a package-
</DIRECTION>
<DELIVERYMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Carson?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Ben nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you mind signing here, please?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELIVERYMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Ben signs for it and takes the package.
</DIRECTION>
<DELIVERYMAN>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have a nice day, Sir...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELIVERYMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Ben shuts the door and examines the UPS box. He's not used to getting many deliveries. He flips it over to see who it is from-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SENDER IS GARY LEWIS...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben grabs a kitchen knife to open the parcel. He tears away the cardboard and empties out the contents onto the living room table-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A DOZEN NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS LAND, ALL MIXED UP, ON THE TABLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
More or less recent, all the articles relate to the department store and the fire that burned it down... Gary has meticulously cut them out and sent them to Ben. But why?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DAY - MAYFLOWER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben's car parks in front of the fence that encloses the entrance to Mayflower.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He runs into Lorenzo who exits the trailer, ready to go home from work-
</DIRECTION>
<LORENZO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've just been through the craziest day here... No kidding! Your ex- colleagues came to pay us a visit...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORENZO>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<LORENZO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know Gary, the guy who was working here before you, the cops found him dead in a subway station in Harlem. I never liked him too much, but poor guy, he didn't deserve to go like that...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORENZO>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did they mention the cause of death?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<LORENZO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No... they wouldn't tell me.

</LORENZO>

Lorenzo hands him over the keys.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Ben? I better get going, Mrs. Sapelli is waiting for me at home. Have a good night at work, Ben. Oh, and by the way, about that leak, they're sending someone over to work at it the beginning of next week.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORENZO>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have a good night, Lorenzo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
Ben remains standing on the landing of the trailer for a moment, his gaze fixed at the department store-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE WALLET, THE DREAM, AND NOW, ON TOP OF EVERYTHING, THE NEWS OF GARY'S DEATH... ALL THESE STRANGE COINCIDENCES AROUND HIS PREDECESSOR HAVE AWOKEN HIS CURIOSITY AND DOUBT. BEN WANTS TO KNOW...

INT. DAY-NIGHT - MAYFLOWER ENTRANCE HALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDE SHOT OF MAYFLOWER FIRST FLOOR-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN FAST MOTION- FROM THE FINAL HOUR OF DAY TO THE FALL OF NIGHT. IN THE REFLECTION OF THE MIRRORS, LIGHT GIVES WAY TO THE DARKNESS...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The beam from the flashlight appears in the distance-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Determined, Ben crosses the entrance hall in the direction of the basement door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He goes down-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NIGHT - BASEMENT MAYFLOWER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben appears at the bottom of the stairs with his flashlight, and follows the subterranean passageway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly he is struck by a frightening feeling of déjà-vu, HE IS IN THE VERY ACT OF RELIVING HIS NIGHTMARE IN DETAIL, STEP BY STEP-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the darkness, the rat glides peacefully on the water surface.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He crosses an intersection and, once again-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He recognizes the half-visible Psychiatric Department sign on the tiled wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The beam from his flashlight sweeps across the walls and the piping, bringing to light, in the distance-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BROWNISH DAMP-SPOT.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
<DIRECTION>
(to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn... What is happening to me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
The moisture has pearled into droplets. Slowly, his hand comes closer. The wall crumbles at the slightest touch...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pushed by curiosity, Ben begins to dig a hole in the plaster, just as he had done in his nightmare...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He hears the echoing sound of streaming water, coming from the other side of the wall. It confirms the existence of a hidden room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben begins to dig frenetically in the saturated wall, creating a large enough opening to access the other side-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He inspects the interior with his flashlight, revealing-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BRICK ROOM AND IN THE MIDDLE THE OCTAGONAL ROOM, SURROUNDED BY THE MIRRORING WALLS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He enters. His image is reflected in all directions and multiplied into infinity. His dream was foreboding. Everything is perfectly identical to the nightmare, with the exception of Gary Lewis-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The former watchman is not there but...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALL OF A SUDDEN, BEHIND HIM, ONE OF BEN'S DUPLICATES IN THE INFINITE REFLECTION TURNS AROUND TO OBSERVE HIM WITH AN ICE COLD GLARE...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sensing something wrong, Ben turns around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the silence he faces his infinite reflections, all of them identical- OR ALMOST...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Taking a closer look Ben notices one of the duplicates' faces bearing an expression slightly different from the others'. A SUBTLE GRIN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Knowing that it has been noticed by Ben, the "rebel duplicate" turns his face towards Ben, eyeing him with an evil gaze-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We can hardly recognize Ben's image.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The duplicate takes a step forward from the line of the other reflections and slowly walks towards Ben.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Instinctively, Ben closes his eyes in an attempt to make the vision disappear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When he opens up his eyes again-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS EVIL DOUBLE RUSHES TOWARDS HIM-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben steps back terrified.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:

INT. DAY- CORONER'S OFFICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Under the dazzling neon light of the NYPD coroner's premises, Amy is in full swing submitting her conclusions on a homicide to the police inspectors in charge of the investigation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is interrupted by somebody who enters the room- There is someone for her at the reception, who insists on seeing her urgently. Amy excuses herself, removes her examination gloves, and exits the autopsy room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We follow her down the corridors as she passes men in police uniforms and doctors in white coats, in the endless comings and goings between the police station and the hospital.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The atmosphere here is highly charged, reflecting the excessive activity of this particular department. There is no doubt- we are in New York City.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CORONER'S OFFICE LOBBY - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amy comes to the reception desk. Ben, who clearly hasn't slept since the night before, is pacing back and forth.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you OK? What's happening? What are you doing here?

From his pocket, Ben takes out Gary's driver's license. He shows it to her-

<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you want to see him?

</BEN>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are no longer a cop, Ben. This isn't your business anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He sent me a package before he died, with newspaper articles about the Mayflower... I think he was trying to tell me something... I don't know him. I've never even met him, Amy... I need to figure this out.

</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DAY - MORGUE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The refrigerated compartment bays, containing the corpses, are aligned along the basement walls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A young doctor escorts Ben and Amy down the corridors of the morgue. As he is walking, the doctor flips through the register, in search of a name.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gary Lewis... Gary Lewis... Oh, there he is, 58B... He slashed his throat...
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_DOCTOR>
<AMY>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There you go... There's your answer. Your man committed suicide.

	You know a lot of people who cut their own throats?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<YOUNG_DOCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(interrupting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, all I know is that the cops are still investigating this one. That's why we still have the body. People can be very creative when it comes to suicide. I'm sure it's not the craziest thing you've seen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_DOCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
The young doctor stops in front of the number 58B. He opens the door to the refrigerated compartment bay and pulls out the tray carrying the corpse, wrapped in a white sheet-
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_DOCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gary Lewis...
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_DOCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
He lifts the sheet, revealing Gary Lewis' upper body-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gary's eyes are rolled upwards and his throat is wide open. His skin has become translucent, almost purple. His contorted corpse is frozen in a deadly expression of profound suffering... His flesh has started to decompose and putrefy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben stares at the body, in search of a hint, a clue, any useful information...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amy becomes impatient.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got to get back to work, Ben. They're waiting for me upstairs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How... What did he slit his throat with?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
The doctor checks the report.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With... with a piece of mirror.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_DOCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Ben looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_DOCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...He must have smashed it into pieces to have something to slash it with...

<YOUNG_DOCTOR>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Seven years of bad luck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_DOCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, reflected in the stainless-steel door of the compartment bay, Ben sees-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GARY'S FACE TURN SLOWLY TOWARDS HIM. GARY STARES DIRECTLY AT HIM. WITH A VOICE FROM BEYOND, HE DELIVERS A MESSAGE TO BEN-
</DIRECTION>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...ESSSEKERRR...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<DIRECTION>
Ben jumps out of his skin and backs away, terrified. Neither Amy nor the doctor saw anything, of course. They gaze at him with a puzzled look-
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you OK, Ben? What's going on?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
Ben looks at the corpse and its reflection again- Gary is frozen in the same contorted position, as if nothing ever happened.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
<DIRECTION>
(coming to his senses)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need to see his files...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>

Ben raises his voice.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I NEED TO SEE HIS FILES!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Ben, what is it you're after? I am not supposed to show you any file... You're not even allowed to be here. I could get fired for this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
The doctor senses that the conversation is taking on a more personal turn.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'll be off. Amy, you know where to find me if you need me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_DOCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Amy is left alone with Ben.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is happening to you? What is all this supposed to mean? What is going on, Ben?

<DIRECTION>
On the shelves, photographs of Michael and Daisy stand next to the medical records and legal-medicine textbooks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sitting behind Amy's desk, Ben is studying Gary Lewis' file. He flips back and forth through the different documents, photographs, and police reports.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amy observes him, perplexed. We sense that she is concerned about Ben's strange behavior and over sensitivity.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at this picture... Come and see, Amy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
He shows her a snapshot taken by the police. We see Gary soaked in his own blood, the throat slit open. The picture is real, crude. He lies outstretched, facing a mirror shattered into several pointy pieces, like a spider web. In his hand, Gary still holds the piece of glass that he used to cut himself.

Ben points to the reflection in the mirror-
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at the piece of mirror in his hand. In the reflection of the mirror it's covered in blood, and look- in reality, it's clean. Not a drop of blood...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you find it strange that this mirror doesn't reflect an exact image of reality?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't see the difference. It must be an effect of the angle from which the photograph was taken. What is it you are you trying to prove?

	What if the mirrors were showing us something different?

	OK... This is way over my head. I don't have time for your barfly theories.

Ben realizes that he will not succeed in convincing her. Not today.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks for your help...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
He's on his way out, when she holds him back-

The steam has fogged up the mirror of the medicine cabinet.

Ben grabs a towel and steps out of the shower.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He watches his blurry reflection. With his finger, on the surface of the fogged mirror, he writes-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ESSEKER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He contemplates the dripping letters for a long moment, trying to interpret their meaning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the end, he wipes off the mirror with his hand, erasing the word.
</DIRECTION>

Angela is standing behind him in the door opening-

	You won't have any trouble finding another one. A daytime job, a regular job...

</ANGELA>

While she's talking, we see the scene from another point of view- from inside the mirror- As if SOMEONE ELSE WAS LISTENING TO THEM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Angela leaves the bathroom. Ben brushes his teeth. He leans over to rinse his mouth, and when he straightens up-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IT IS NOT HIM IN THE REFLECTION OF THE MIRROR, BUT GARY LEWIS WHO SLASHES HIS THROAT FROM END TO END WITH A SHARP PIECE OF MIRROR-

Ben steps back and loses his balance, knocking down a shelf. Angela rushes into the bathroom-

Ben's Oldsmobile pulls over in the street- He has decided to pass by Gary Lewis' old house before his nightshift.

He presses the doorbell next to Gary Lewis' name. An old lady answers-

MRS. LEWIS is at least 80 years old, and almost blind behind her thick glasses. She lives alone in the small apartment that she used to share with her grandson.

<DIRECTION>
We sense that she is distraught by Gary's death.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_LEWIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...My Gary hadn't slept at home for three weeks. At first I figured he had found himself a girlfriend, so I didn't worry much about it... It's terrible. The policeman told me that he was living in the streets... They found his body in the subway. Why? He had everything he needed here. Every morning I would have his breakfast ready when he'd come home from work.

	What kind of changes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<MRS_LEWIS>

	He didn't care much for anything anymore. Before, we'd sit up and watch television together. But once he started that job as a night watchman, he'd spend all his time-off locked up in his room...

</MRS_LEWIS>
<DIRECTION>
Ben follows Mrs. Lewis to her grandson's room-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It looks nothing like the room of a fifty-year-old man, but rather like that of an old teenager. From what we can see, Gary grew up in here, and each object recalls a stage in his life. Everything is clean and in its proper place, it is perfectly tidy.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you mind if I stay in here for a moment?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Lewis smiles at him. She too, likes to gather her thoughts in Gary's room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben scrutinizes the room in search of a clue, a hint that might help him on the Esseker lead. He opens the drawers and looks through the papers-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing is of any help to him. The only place left that he hasn't searched is the walk-in closet, whose half-open doors seem to invite him to enter...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
What Ben discovers inside is beyond anything he could ever have imagined- The closet has been emptied out completely, and MIRRORS COVER EACH AND EVERY WALL, FROM THE FLOOR TO THE CEILING! - It's a miniature replica of the hidden room that Ben discovered back in the basement of the department store...
</DIRECTION>

	To look at oneself too much is a sin. A terrible sin. Do you know sir in the Garden of Eden in order to seduce Eve, Satan did not keep the appearance of a snake... Satan reproduced the young woman's traits in such a way that Eve would only see and listen to the image of herself... As in a mirror.

INT. NIGHT - MAYFLOWER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Night has fallen. The department store is calm and silent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We move down each floor to the entrance hall. The basement door is open and, in the darkness, we see the gleam of the flashlight. Ben must be down there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALL OF A SUDDEN, A LOUD SHRIEK TEARS THROUGH THE SILENCE. There is a woman, somewhere in the store.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben runs up to the entrance hall at full speed. The shrieks resound through the department store again. They seem to come from one of the floors above.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Without hesitation, Ben dashes up the stairs-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He arrives on the second floor and searches through all the departments. Impossible to tell where the cries originate from.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He climbs up to the third floor. The beam of the flashlight sweeps past each nook and dark corner-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Somewhere in the store, the woman continues to scream and wail to death.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
<DIRECTION>
(shouting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	WHERE ARE YOU?!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
No answer. Ben goes up to the fourth floor. The shrieks are heard again, but this time, coming from one of the floors below. Ben dashes for the Ladies' department-

INT. NIGHT - LADIES' DEPARTMENT DRESSING ROOMS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The screams come closer. Ben passes the counters and enters the dressing rooms - or rather, what is left of them since the fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The woman must be in here, hiding somewhere.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm here Ma'am...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
Short of breath, Ben inspects the dressing rooms with his flashlight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The woman seems to have vanished.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ma'am? I'm right he...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER SHRIEK IS EMITTED, RIGHT NEXT TO HIM. He turns around-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No one there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
About to leave the dressing rooms, Ben catches sight of a mirror. In the reflection he sees the row of empty rooms-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BLOODY HAND BURSTS OUT FROM THE LAST ONE, ACCOMPANIED BY ANOTHER PIERCING SCREECH OF PAIN!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben runs to it, but finds it empty. IN THE REFLECTION OF THE MIRROR, HOWEVER, THE HAND IS STILL STRETCHED OUT TOWARDS HIM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben stops to think- If he can somehow move the mirror to have it face the last booth, he might be able to see what truly happened inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben unhooks the mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is way too heavy and bulky to carry. He lets it slide down the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inch by inch, Ben hauls the mirror across the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches the last dressing room-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the reflection in the mirror, he examines the interior of the cubicle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the dark he catches sight of BARE FEET STAMPING AGAINST THE TILED FLOOR. The torn, half-burnt curtains conceal the rest of the body...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With his eyes fixed on the mirror, Ben walks backward towards the dressing room. He is scared of what he is about to discover. He gives the curtain a quick yank, revealing-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A NAKED YOUNG WOMAN IS GOING INTO SPASMS AND SCREECHING WITH PAIN. DESPITE THE ABSENCE OF REAL FLAMES, HER SKIN AND FLESH ARE ROASTING, AS IF SHE WERE BURNING ALIVE FROM THE INSIDE OUT!

Amy goes back to her room. The local news play on the TV. She gets into bed and turns off the light. She reaches for the remote and clicks the TV off, turning over-

THE NAKED BURNED WOMAN FROM THE STORE STANDS STILL IN THE REFLECTION OF THE TV SET.

The entity watches Amy while she is sleeping.

He walks towards the trailer, while keeping a fixed eye on the facade of the building. The scene he just witnessed in the dressing rooms has shaken him up.

She hangs up the receiver and stays in the dark for a moment, concerned.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of the pouring bath brings her back to reality.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We follow her into the bathroom. She dips her fingers into the water to check the temperature. The bathtub is almost full.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Angela undresses in front of the medicine cabinet mirror. When she turns around to climb into the hot bath, HER REFLECTION REMAINS MOTIONLESS IN THE MIRROR, STARING BLANKLY AT EACH OF HER MOVEMENTS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unaware, Angela soaks into her hot bath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The water continues to pour from the tap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Angela shuts her eyes- It's been a long day.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE MIRROR, ANGELA'S REFLECTION FIXES HER WITH A COLD GLARE-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Without a word, Angela's reflection brings its hands to its face and digs its fingers into its mouth. In a sudden jerk, it pulls open its jaw-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AS IF SHE WERE ELECTROCUTED, ANGELA'S BODY CONTORTS VIOLENTLY FORWARD. HER MOUTH IS DEFORMED, AS IF AN INVISIBLE FORCE WERE WRENCHING IT WIDE OPEN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE MIRROR, HER EVIL DOUBLE CONTINUES TO PULL OPEN ITS MOUTH, SUDDENLY RIPPING ITS JAW OFF WITH THE SOUND OF CRACKING BONES AND CARTILAGE-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE SAME INSTANT, IN THE BATHTUB, ANGELA HAS NO TIME TO REACT BEFORE SHE UNDERGOES THE SAME AGONIZING TORTURE!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The mirror cracks by itself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bathtub overflows with red water spilling out on the white tiled bathroom floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO BLACK

<DIRECTION>
INT. DAY - APARTMENT QUEENS - THE NEXT MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The camera flashes illuminate the crime scene.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Angela's body lies afloat in the bathtub. The apartment is entirely flooded.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two men in police uniforms close off a security zone, to keep the intrusive neighbors away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A detective is interrogating an old Puerto Rican couple- the downstairs neighbors. They were the ones who alerted the police, after having noticed the water leakage. The old woman explains how "it was raining blood into her living room"...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amongst the police officers and the legal medical squad, we find Larry. He is in charge of the case.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leaning over the bathtub, Larry examines the visible parts of the corpse. Angela's face is concealed by her own long black hair, floating in the murky water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Larry slips on an examination glove, pulls up his sleeve and sinks his arm into the blood-red bath. He feels around for the chain of the plug in order to drain the bathtub.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The water level begins to recede, gradually revealing Angela's naked corpse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With the tip of his fingers, Larry lifts away the few strands of hair covering Angela's face-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Taken by surprise, he steps back from the horrifying sight of this JAW-LESS FACE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Larry removes his glove, wipes off his bloodied arm and starts to leave the bathroom when something else catches his attention-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He comes closer to the spiderweb cracked medicine cabinet mirror. A TINY DROP OF BLOOD is dripping from one of the cracks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Strange.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A DARK SILHOUETTE PASSES BEHIND HIM IN THE REFLECTION. He turns immediately- The bloodied bathroom is still and silent. Angela's destroyed body lies in the empty bathtub.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A police inspector in the next room, calls out to him-
</DIRECTION>

Still wearing his uniform, Ben is sitting alone in one of the interrogation rooms of the police station. His haggard face expresses great grief. His sister's death has left him distraught.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He fiddles with an empty plastic cup in his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The classic two-way mirror facing him, throws back his reflection.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben knows that he is being watched.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind the two-way mirror, Amy observes him. Larry is standing next to her.
</DIRECTION>
<LARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The water has obliterated most of the marks. No trace of struggle or broken entry, the entrance door was locked. The person who did this must have had the keys to her apartment, or otherwise it was somebody she knew...

	Listen, so far, his statement is pretty consistent with the facts... We checked it out, he did place a call from work at 12:30, and the woman's downstairs neighbors claim they started noticing the water leakage at around two in the morning. The daytime security guard, Lorenzo Sappeli, confirms he came on after Ben's shift at seven a.m. The only strange thing, and it may just be a coincidence, is that Ben told Sappeli that he had decided to quit his job, as if he was planning to go away somewhere... Did he mention anything about it to you?

Ben does not turn around. The rain is beating down harder and the thunder grumbles in the distance. The first lightning flashes light up the sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another flash-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- QUEENS APARTMENT -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben ignores the crime scene's restriction perimeter and enters Angela's apartment. Without turning on the light, he goes straight for a leather pouch stashed among his cardboard boxes.

<DIRECTION>
Inside- A .357 MAGNUM, his former cop weapon.

<DIRECTION>
Another flash-

Ben's car is parked in front of the construction fence.

INT. NIGHT - MAYFLOWER

The rainwater pours through the openings in the roof, penetrating the interior of the deserted department store. It dribbles down the cracked walls and over the half-burnt mannequins...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NIGHT - MAYFLOWER BASEMENT- MIRROR ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear the echo of the roaring thunder outside, but in the gloom of the flooded basement, there is another blaring sound-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A DULL METALLIC THUD. It gets louder and louder, closer and closer as we advance towards the opening to the mirror room-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside, we find Ben, out of his mind, throwing a chair against the mirrors with all his strength, in an attempt to demolish them-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's exhausted and he's forced to stop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Not a single shard of glass, not even a scratch, the mirrors seem completely indestructible...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben is not through with them. He drops the chair to the ground and pulls out the gun from his belt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Without a moment's hesitation he opens fire-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE MIRRORS SHATTER VIOLENTLY, CRACKING WITH THE POWERFUL IMPACT OF THE BULLETS. In the spiderweb-cracked mirror, his image is deformed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Having found a weak spot, Ben savors his sweet victory when, suddenly, something inconceivable unfolds before his very eyes-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BULLET IMPACTS DISSOLVE AS IF BY MAGIC AND THE MIRRORS ARE RECONSTITUTED!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben's shock and disbelief give way to rage. He fires, in a fury, emptying the entire clip this time-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Again, the bullet holes vanish, leaving Ben alone, face to face with his own reflection. He breaks down nervously-
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why did you do it? WHY? WHY DID YOU HAVE TO KILL HER?

Suddenly, one after the other, letters, start appearing in one of the mirrors, as if an invisible finger were tracing them in the dust-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REKESSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben turns around, and in the reflection of the opposite mirror he recognizes the inverted word- the same word he found on the note in Gary's wallet, the word Ben himself had traced in his bathroom mirror-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ESSEKER

INT. NIGHT -QUEENS APARTMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Back in the Queens apartment, Ben still hasn't gotten any sleep. On the wall, he is assembling all the newspaper clippings, articles and photographs that Gary sent him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Each and every mirror in Angela's apartment has been covered with sheets, blankets, old rags- anything he could find to neutralize the reflective surfaces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With the phone cradled between his ear and shoulder he is in the middle of a heated conversation-
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Look up Esseker... Yes, Echo, Sierra, Sierra, Echo, Kilo, Echo, Romeo... Esseker. No idea, my guess is that it's a name... No, I haven't got a first name. Yes, in New York. Over the past five or six years. I know it's hazy but that's all I've got. I already looked it up in the phone book. I also called someone at the IRS and at the DMV, but nothing there. It's very important Larry. You'll call me back? Ok...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
Ben hangs up the phone and remains in front of the wall covered with clippings for a moment. Now he can have a clear overview of Gary's investigative research.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All the articles date back approximately to the same period and are all related to the fire that ravaged Mayflower five years ago.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But not a hint of Esseker.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben studies the newspaper clippings, trying to piece the story together-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
" Deadly Fire at Mayflower- 29 dead and 78 wounded "
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
" Brutal Massacre- Mother and her three daughters slaughtered..."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
" ...the children, drowned, in the bathtub... "
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
" ...the throat slit open... "
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
" Mayflower's security guard taken in for questioning... "
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
" The night watchman confesses to setting the fire but firmly denies the accusation of murdering his family... "

" Terrence Berry confesses but claims the mirrors are guilty- The security guard at Mayflower finally confesses. He started the fire in the department store with the intention of destroying the mirrors, responsible, according to him, for the death of his wife and three daughters. "
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben observes Terrence Berry's face in one of the archive photographs. He looks like a perfectly normal guy, rather kind, surely he was a good father... Ben can't help but empathize with him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he looks up, Ben catches a glimpse of his reflection in the window-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
What if he too lost his mind and went on to slaughter his family? Or what if the mirrors would do it?

The phone rings-

He hangs up the phone. Under the blanket, next to him, he spots the T-shirt that his sister was wearing the other night.

The pain is too strong. He cannot hold back his tears anymore and starts crying.

The next morning -

<DIRECTION>
Heavy-eyed and sleepy, Michael is hypnotized in front of the weather forecast on TV.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hot chocolate set in front of him is getting cold. His sister Daisy pours herself some more orange juice. Amy, shaking a box of cereal, interrupts the little boy in his dream state-
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>

Michael begins to eat his breakfast, his gaze still fixed on the weatherman's forecast on TV. As Amy fills the cat's bowl with pellets, Tiger rushes over to join the rest of the family.

The little boy stays quiet.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He doesn't want me to talk about him.

Amy suddenly becomes more concerned and sits down next to Michael-
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why doesn't he want you to talk about him? Is he a grown up?

</AMY>
<MICHAEL>

</MICHAEL>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, he's a little boy your age, then?

Michael gives a reluctant nod. Amy is reassured. He finishes his mug of cereal and goes to place it in the sink. Amy gives Daisy a questioning look-
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>

(CONT'D) (to Michael)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does he live in our street? Is it one of our neighbors?

Michael remains silent and Daisy answers for him-
</DIRECTION>
<DAISY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He lives in the mirror in our room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAISY>
<DIRECTION>
Daisy bursts out laughing... Michael glares back at her, furious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Puzzled, Amy reflects briefly on Daisy's remark-
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it your father who told you that?

<DIRECTION>
Michael remains silent.

Amy questions him with her eyes. Michael lowers his.

	OK... Come on, come on guys, let's get our teeth brushed, and our coats on. The first one in the car is the winner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>

The two kids dash up the stairs. Amy is left alone to clean up breakfast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She casts a glance at the front hall mirror. Daisy's comment lingers in her thoughts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dressed in their coats, Michael and Daisy come running down the stairs and rush out of the house... Amy exits the house. The car drives away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Daisy's cat leaps onto the kitchen table and directs his gaze to the mirror-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FOR NO APPARENT REASON, THE CAT SUDDENLY STIFFENS INTO A POSITION OF DEFENSE. HE BRISTLES HIS COAT AND HISSES AND SPITS TOWARDS HIS REFLECTION IN THE MIRROR.

DR. MORRIS, the doctor who had once been in charge of Terrence Berry, escorts Ben down the corridor-
</DIRECTION>
<DR_MORRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A feeling of self-hatred, generally triggered by a psychological shock can split the personality in two, hence creating two or more personalities with distinct memories or behavior patterns within the same individual. The patient then has a faulty perception of the existence of two distinct worlds, which are principally the "real" word, and the world "inside the mirror".
	</DIALOGUE>

The two men pass a number of guards and security check-points as they head down towards the hospital's film and video archive-

Dr. Morris swipes his magnetic card through the electronic device, unlocking the door to the archives.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_MORRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In my opinion, he was convinced that he was telling the truth when he claimed he didn't kill his family. I too am convinced that when it happened, Terrence was not himself, but rather his double, his mirror image, one might say.

He pushes the tape into the deck. A grainy picture appears on the screen-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We discover TERRENCE BERRY, sitting behind a desk. His hands are cuffed. Facing him, DR. MORRIS is leading the cross-examination.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Terrence is tense and uncomfortable. He keeps his face down, never looking into the camera.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DESPITE HAVING SURVIVED THE FIRE, TERRENCE'S FACE IS NONETHELESS DISFIGURED BY THIRD DEGREE BURNS. HE NO LONGER HAS FACIAL FEATURES, AND HE STRUGGLES WITH HIS SPEECH.

<DIRECTION>
He is beside himself. After seeing the video footage on Terrence, he has been struck with fear and panic for his family-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Before the perplexed gaze of Rosa and his children, Ben agitatedly comes and goes in the hallway of the second floor. He is removing the mirrors from each and every room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He tears away the bathroom mirror, unhooks the one in the far end of the hallway, and removes some from Amy's room...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rosa fears more and more for the children and takes them under her protective arms. Amy is not back yet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The only mirror left that Ben cannot remove, is the one in the children's room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He rushes down to the basement and comes back with a bucket of old paint. He immediately begins to paint the wall mirror in order to neutralize its reflection.

Ben stops-

<BEN>

	You have to trust me Amy, I'm not completely crazy... These mirrors are dangerous. At first, I thought it was only the ones at the store, but now I know they can get you anywhere. They got Angela... I promise I'll leave the house once I've taken them all down.

<AMY>

	Do you realize what you're saying, Ben? What is wrong with you? I know that what you're going through isn't easy. Angela was a part of our lives too, but you have no right to do this to us... Ever since your obsession with these damn mirrors the kids are scared to death. Your son has nightmares. He's scared Ben... Your behavior is starting to rub off on him. He's only 5 years old... And I have to protect him.

Ben keeps a piercing gaze as the bullet impacts the mirror, waiting for the magic to do its trick and for the cracks to dissolve again-

BUT NOTHING HAPPENS. THE CRACKS REMAIN, IN A SPIDER WEB PATTERN.

Behind the front door, Ben notices Michael, watching him, in tears.

The neighbors, alerted by the blast of the gun, come out of their houses to find out what has happened.

Ben stands alone, looking like a mad man...

Amy holds back her tears and tries to stay in control-
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>

	Get out...now! I don't ever want to see you here again, Ben. And I'll have the lawyers make sure the same goes for the kids. You are insane, Ben, and dangerous... You've got to get help.

Ben hangs up.

He glances back at the rear view mirror and sees ANGELA'S CORPSE, SITTING ON THE BACK SEAT!

Startled, he loses control of the vehicle. A truck approaches at full speed in the opposite lane. He barely avoids the collision.

Two other cars appear. Ben zigzags in and out, just barely avoiding a fatal crash.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stops along the edge of the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben closes his eyes and rests his head against the steering wheel in an attempt to clear his mind. He looks up into the rear- view mirror again-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGELA'S REFLECTION IS STILL THERE. Behind her long black hair, she fixes him with a milky gaze.
</DIRECTION>

Ben flies into a rage. HE SMASHES THE REAR-VIEW MIRROR WITH HIS BARE FIST, REDUCING IT TO SCRAPS...

	When the nurses went on their rounds, first thing on the morning of October 6th, they discovered that all the patients had left their rooms during the night and gathered in the main room. All of them were dead, including the girl. Apparently, they had killed one another... A slaughter house... After that they shut down the place. Nobody ever found out what really happened.

INT. NIGHT - QUEENS APARTMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Angela's apartment is plunged in total darkness-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben lays Anna Esseker's file on the coffee table and aims the desk lamp at his "research corner" on the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns the lamp back at the file and sits down to study it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHY ARE THE MIRRORS ASKING FOR ANNA IF SHE'S ALREADY DEAD? WHY? IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On an index card filled in by Anna's parents in September 1952, Ben finds a Pennsylvania home address.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dr. Kane's first diagnosis is irrevocable - "Despite her young age, Anna Esseker suffers from severe schizophrenia, leading to withdrawal from reality, delusional and violent behavior."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He shuffles through the first few pages of various administrative documents.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His eye lands on several photographs of Anna taken at the time she was admitted to the hospital- She is just a child, yet, six male nurses were needed to restrain and immobilize her in front of the photographer. Her face is hardly discernible as she struggles like a wild animal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A high-pitched sound of cracking glass is heard from behind. Ben turns around-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another loud crack - It comes from one of the covered mirrors in the apartment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben rises slowly to his feet and comes closer. He removes the sheet hanging on the frame-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A crack has appeared in the upper corner of the mirror. Ben casts his eyes over the reflection. His glance comes to rest on Anna's file laying on the desk-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He goes to fetch the photograph of the little girl and presents it to the mirror-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KRAAAAACK - the crack in the mirror spreads, as if some kind of pressure were applied on the other side of the mirror as a reaction to the photograph...

She passes in front of the children's room and stops- INSIDE, MICHAEL IS TALKING TO SOMEBODY. Amy listens closely, but she can only hear Michael's voice. On the other side of the door, the little boy bursts out in laughter-

She opens the door and finds her son squatting in front of the mirror, talking to his own reflection.

The little boy does as his mother says. He gets up and dashes out of the room.

<DIRECTION>
Amy's glance freezes in horror. Terrified, she almost loses her balance-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL'S REFLECTION IS STILL IN THE MIRROR, SITTING IN A SQUATTING POSITION!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HE LOOKS AT AMY WITH A BIG SMILE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amy attempts to speak but can't-

The mirror image of her son remains silent.

The windowpanes and picture frames have been wrapped securely with newspaper and tape.

Every inch of reflective surface in the house, such as the TV- screen and the shiny taps, have been "neutralized" with strips of masking tape...

EXT. DAY - ESSEKER FARMHOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wind blows over the land.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the winter season, the muddy fields have little to offer to the few starving crows flying over them. A feeling of desolation and solitude hangs over the deserted landscape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben's car has left the asphalt road behind, driving through the countryside down a winding dirt road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An old farmhouse stands at the very end of the path. If it weren't for the parked pick-up truck and the few piglets running wild, one would think that the farmhouse was abandoned.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben gets out of the car and goes to knock on the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His shoes sink into the mud. He walks up the steps of the porch and peeks inside the house through the front window. In the dark he discerns the silhouette of a person who is watching TV. He can't help but notice all the mirrors have been covered or turned towards the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A big dog barks behind the window. Ben steps back, surprised.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The front door opens before Ben has even made his presence known. A young man stares at him in silence.

INT. DAY - FARMHOUSE BASEMENT

We are in the dark basement, under the farmhouse. The door to the first floor opens, letting the light in. Ben appears next to the silhouette of an old man- ROBERT ESSEKER, 80 years old, Anna's elder brother.
</DIRECTION>

Robert walks down the steps, signaling Ben to follow him-

What's left of a very primitive child's room, SURROUNDED BY DOUBLE WIRE FENCING AND IRON BARS. Rather than a cell, it more resembles a HUMAN-SIZED CAGE, CAPABLE OF RESISTING THE MOST FEROCIOUS BEAST.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he's talking, images flash on screen- painful memories from that time come back to him-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna being carried to the basement, her innocent eyes full of hate. It's even hard to recognize the face of a little girl. Her howling screams. Her nails digging into her own flesh. Her unnatural strength and the violent thrashing of her arms and legs.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We had every priest, doctor, healer, coming from all over the state, one after the other. But no one could help her.

Ben comes closer to the iron bars of the cage. He can see Anna's scratch marks next to the bed, giving his imagination a taste of her plight and suffering.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Finally, Dr. Kane from New York answered my parents' cry for help. He rejected the idea of demonic possession, said he didn't believe in it. He was convinced that Anna suffered from a rare form of personality disorder. He wanted Anna under his care, at St. John's. My parents were very poor, but he agreed to cover all the hospital costs... In less than five months, Dr. Kane had cured Anna. It was unbelievable. She was her old self again. A real miracle of science.

Robert hesitates -

	Before he died, Kane sent us a letter asking us to keep Anna away from mirrors and that whatever happens she should be in a place where the mirrors could never find her.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is she now?

On the other side of the cloister wall, a small winding road zigzags between the pine trees. Ben's car draws nearer. He parks in front of the entrance to the monastery.

Inside the house in Jersey, Amy has isolated herself with the kids in the parent's bedroom. She's reading them a bedtime story.

Even if all the windows, screens, and TV are covered by newspapers or painting, Amy acts in front of Daisy and Michael as if nothing has happened.

In the rest of the house, everything has been meticulously covered, wrapped, painted or reversed. Still, here and there, a barely audible rustle pierces through the silence-

In the children's room, the paint covering the mirror slowly begins to flake off...

Ben sits down. Even at a short distance he cannot discern the face of Anna Esseker, who is now Sister Anna.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My name is Benjamin Carson. I work as a night watchman at 1229 West 38th Street in New York City, what used to be St. John's Hospital.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<SISTER_ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it you want Mr. Carson?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SISTER_ANNA>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need your help.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<SISTER_ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My help? I don't quite see how I could possibly be of any help.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SISTER_ANNA>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My wife and children are in danger. What is threatening my family is asking for you...

<DIRECTION>
For a split second, Ben makes eye contact with Anna behind the screen. She has understood...

	If you don't help me I may lose the only thing that matters to me.

	I cannot leave the precincts. It's impossible.

</SISTER_ANNA>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me why are the mirrors from the old hospital so determined to find you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>

Sister Anna remains silent-

<BEN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I must know, Sister.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<SISTER_ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is not the wish of the mirrors to find me, but of what is imprisoned inside them. The mirrors are merely windows on our world...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SISTER_ANNA>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A window... For what? For whom?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At the time that I was at St. John's, Dr. Kane's therapy for personality disorders consisted of locking the patient up in a mirrored room for several days on end, in order to force him to confront his own image. I spent the darkest days of my life in that room. On the 6th day the nurses found me lifeless, almost dead. Since that day, I have never had another fit. But deep down inside I've always known the truth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What truth?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is no cure for schizophrenia, it was something else, Mr. Carson. And whatever it was, it entered the mirror.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
We can feel the emotion in her voice.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought that after fifty years, this would have all gone away. They would have disappeared from the mirrors. I didn't know.... I'm sorry but if I agree to go with you and return to that place, I will make it possible for them to cross the threshold back into the real world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
Everything is now making sense for Ben-
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It entered with you and they need you to get out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The consequences of such an act, Mr. Carson, would be more devastating than letting them suffer where they are now. I'm going to pray for you and your family. That's all I can do right now, Mr. Carson. God bless you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
She stands to leave.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait... Please, listen to me- Terence Berry, Gary Lewis and many others before me... Those are the people who died trying to find you. Because they failed, their families died too. My sister was murdered two days ago... My wife and kids will next if you don't come with me. Look-
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
From his wallet Ben takes out a wrinkled photograph of Michael, as a baby, in Amy's arms. Daisy stands next to them in the picture. Ben presses the photograph against the grating for Anna to look at it.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My wife and two children. They're all I've got. They're innocent... Please.

Anna stays quiet a moment behind the screen and leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I KNOW YOU ARE SCARED OF GOING BACK THERE. IT'S EASIER TO KEEP HIDING BUT THIS IS NOT THE HOUSE OF GOD ANYMORE. WHILE YOU'RE PRAYING PEOPLE ARE DYING ON YOUR TIME!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
Anna doesn't respond and disappears in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben failed. He's desperate and lost. He has a hard time containing his anger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DAY - MONASTERY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the horizon, a red sun sets behind the treetops. It's almost nightfall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bells from the monastery begin to toll.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cross above the monastery reflects upside down in a puddle of rain water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frustrated, Ben walks back to his car and dials his home number on his cell phone -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NIGHT -NEW JERSEY HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the distance, the lights of Manhattan sparkle in the night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the house, all the lights are off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All is quiet, too quiet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NIGHT - HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the hallway, the shiny doorknob leading to Amy's bedroom is the only reflecting surface that has been forgotten.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the distorted reflection, we see Michael's silhouette approaching. The little boy reaches for the knob but-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN REALITY, NO HAND TOUCHES IT-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IT'S MICHAEL'S REFLECTION INSIDE THE SHINY KNOB THAT IS OPENING THE DOOR!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside the bedroom, Amy fell asleep with Daisy in her arms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the bedside table, THE HOME PHONE STARTS RINGING- She wakes up with a jolt and picks up the cordless receiver-
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello? Ben... Where are you? Did you find her? Did you talk to...
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
She stops speaking as she realizes- Daisy is asleep next to her but MICHAEL IS NO LONGER THERE.

She sees that THE BEDROOM DOOR IS HALF OPENED.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)

The sound of pouring water is heard, coming from the hallway. Michael must be in the bathroom.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Amy, what's going on? Are you alright?
	</DIALOGUE>

Amy runs to the door, waking Daisy up.

<DIRECTION>
INT. NIGHT - CORRIDOR/BATHROOM - CONTINUITY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amy comes out of the bedroom and notices that the floor is completely soaked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns on the light in the hallway, only to discover-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The entire upper floor is covered by an inch of water- all the taps in the bathroom are turned on and have transformed the surface of the floor into A LARGE NATURAL MIRROR...
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
<DIRECTION>
(to Ben on the phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck! There is water everywhere... Michael? Michael? MICHAEL?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
Amy freezes when she realizes that all the picture frames and all the mirrors in the corridor have been scraped, bringing the reflecting surfaces, once again, to the light...
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (scared)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ben, someone scraped all the mirrors... There is someone in the house.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know where he is. I don't see him. I...
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
As she turns in the hallway, Amy sees A DARK SHADOW MOVING IN ONE OF THE MIRRORS. Terrified, she steps back and hits the opposite wall. She drops the phone on the flooded floor-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DAY - MONASTERY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the same moment, Ben, still outside of the monastery, is cut off in his conversation with his wife-
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Amy? Amy? Answer me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
He tried to redial but that doesn't work. He knows something weird is happening there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Without hesitation, Ben grabs his gun inside the car and walks back towards the monastery gates.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-BACK IN THE HOUSE-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unsure of what she saw, Amy makes a step towards the mirror but only finds her own reflection.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She picks up the phone- The water shorted it out...
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
Cautiously, Amy walks up to the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Michael?

</AMY>

She opens the door- the sink and bathtub are filled with water overflowing onto the tiled floor. Michael is not there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NIGHT - MONASTERY CELL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hand enters frame to light some candles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sister Anna is back in her cell. The way her hand shakes as she carries the match from one candle to the other betrays how upset she is by the confrontation with Ben- It's been too much time that she's carrying the guilt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She runs the rosary nervously between her fingers and kneels down in front of her bed to pray when-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A loud muted sound followed by a sudden wave of agitation is heard outside the cell. Someone has broken into the monastery. She recognizes Ben's voice- Like a mad man, he's looking for her everywhere and threatens the other nuns to show him the way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna stands up when Ben bursts into her cell with his gun in his hand. Behind him, the other nuns are terrified.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben points the gun at Anna-
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My kids are not going to die tonight. You're coming with me, now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
Not intimidated by the weapon, Anna steps towards Ben. FOR THE FIRST TIME, BEN CAN SEE HER FACE- The old lady seems more determined than ever-
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I come with you Mr. Carson, you have to promise to do everything I tell you. My way. No questions.
	</DIALOGUE>

Ben lowers his gun-

INT. NIGHT- BEDROOM- MEANWHILE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Daisy waits patiently in the bed following her mother's instructions. Suddenly she hears her mother calling her from the children's bedroom-
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Daisy... Daisy... Come here...
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
Daisy steps into the corridor and stops, for a moment, when she notices the flooding. She enters her bedroom, following the voice that calls out for her-
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>

(O.S.) (CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Daisy... Daisy...
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NIGHT - CHILDREN'S BEDROOM - CONTINUITY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Daisy explores the bedroom. The voice is still calling, but her mother is not there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door shuts behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She walks up to the mirror on the wall. The paint has been partially scraped off-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE LITTLE GIRL DISCOVERS HER MOTHER'S REFLECTION ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MIRROR-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NIGHT - BATHROOM - MEANWHILE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BUT IN REALITY, AMY IS STILL IN THE BATHROOM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns off the tap and sinks her hand into the depths of the bathtub to pull the plug, when she sees Michael's reflection on the surface -
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Micha...
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
She turns around, but Michael is not behind her. The reflection lied.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUDDENLY HER ARM IS PULLED INTO THE BATHTUB.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AN INVISIBLE FORCE PLUNGES HER HEAD INTO THE WATER TO DROWN HER. AMY STRUGGLES FRENETICALLY BUT THE PRESSURE IS TOO STRONG FOR HER TO BREAK FREE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-BACK IN THE CHILDREN'S BEDROOM-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Daisy walks up to her mother's reflection in the mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY_S_REFLECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come sweetheart... Come, come closer... Come...
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY_S_REFLECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Daisy is mistrustful. She senses that something is not right. In the mirror, her mother's attitude is different and strange...
</DIRECTION>
<DAISY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing in there, Mom?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAISY>
<AMY_S_REFLECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come closer, don't worry... Everything is all right, sweetheart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY_S_REFLECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Daisy obeys when, suddenly, she notices that her mother holds a pair of scissors in her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Daisy has no time to react-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE REFLECTION OF THE MOTHER GRABS THE REFLECTION OF THE LITTLE GIRL, HOLDING HER FIRMLY IN HER ARMS-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BY SOME INVISIBLE FORCE, IN REALITY, DAISY IS SUSPENDED IN THE AIR IN FRONT OF THE MIRROR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-BACK IN THE BATHROOM -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With her head still submerged in the bathtub, Amy is drowning. She tries to fight back. Unsuccessfully. Her head stays under the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With the tips of her fingers, Amy feels her way to the plug. She pulls it out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly, the water level begins to go down. Too slowly. Amy struggles to pull her head out of the water to breath again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The water continues to recede. Amy has reached exhaustion, her hands clutch onto the edge of the bathtub. She is suffocating.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the last minute, she turns her head to gasp for air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The remaining water swirls down the drain. The bathtub is now empty and the invisible force seems to have vanished.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amy collapses to the ground, spitting and coughing. She comes to her senses, gets back to her feet and dashes out of the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Michael?! Michael?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
As she runs past the bedroom, she notices that the door is open-
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Daisy !?
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Daisy is no longer there.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Daisy !
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
Panicked, Amy crosses the corridor and barges into the children's room. Inside she discovers-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NIGHT - CHILDREN'S ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUSPENDED IN THE AIR, A FEW INCHES OFF THE GROUND, DAISY STRUGGLES TO BREAK FREE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the mirror, Amy sees her own reflection bringing the sharp blade of the scissors to her daughter's throat. The blade glides over her skin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In reality, A TRICKLE OF BLOOD APPEARS ON DAISY'S THROAT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Instinctively, Amy throws herself against Daisy, tearing her away from the grip of her own reflection. They land on the floor and crawl to the corner of the room, safe from the danger of the reflections.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amy tears off a piece of her clothing, which she presses against Daisy's throat in order to stop the bleeding.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my god, don't move baby, don't move...
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
Amy is out of control, holding Daisy tightly in her arms. She is terror-stricken by the events in the house...
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't move sweetheart...
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
Fortunately, Daisy's wound is not deep. The blade did not reach the main artery. Amy saved her life at the very last minute.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Daisy is half conscious from the loss of blood. She struggles to speak-
</DIRECTION>
<DAISY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why did you do this, Mom?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAISY>
<AMY>
<DIRECTION>
(in tears)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It wasn't me Daisy, it wasn't me... I would never hurt you, you know that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DAISY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whe...where is Michael ?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAISY>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know where he is... I'm going to take care of you and then we're going to find him...OK But for now, we have to get out of here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DAISY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is Daddy coming back soon?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAISY>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, he'll be here soon as he can.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
A bit further away, in the scraped section of the mirror, we can see Amy's reflection, on its knees above Daisy who lies on the floor-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THIS EVIL VERSION OF THE REALITY, Amy's double has killed her own daughter. Using the scissors, she's "working" on the dead body. What exactly is she doing to the little girl?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns toward us, revealing HER FACE AND HANDS COVERED WITH FRESH BLOOD!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AMY'S REFLECTION COMES CLOSER TO PEEK THROUGH THE MIRROR , WITH HER HANDS PRESSED AGAINST THE GLASS, AS IF IT WERE JUST A WINDOW.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN SEARCH OF THE REAL AMY AND DAISY, the forces of the mirrors are determined to get them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Away from the field of vision of the mirror, Amy crawls on the floor towards the door-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NIGHT - BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amy comes back to the bedroom, carrying Daisy in her arms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she passes the bureau, she grabs the first-aid-kit from one of the drawers. She sets her daughter down in the walk-in closet, away from the mirrors. The little girl has trouble moving.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amy examines the cut on Daisy's throat. Quickly, with a professional touch, she disinfects and bandages the wound.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen to me carefully Daisy... I want you to stay in here and be quiet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
Daisy is terrified and with her remaining strength, she holds on to her mother tightly.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have to be brave, sweetheart... I want you to stay in here and not get out until I come back, no matter what happens. I'm going to find Michael... Do you hear me?

</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
Not quite convinced, Daisy accepts reluctantly.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am so proud of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
Amy shuts the door of the closet. Through the wooden slats she can see her daughter inside-
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't move...
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
Amy exits the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NIGHT - CORRIDOR/STAIRCASE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Even though she turned off the taps upstairs Amy can still hear the water pouring downstairs...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On guard, Amy walks down the stairs, step by step. She is frightened and her heart is pounding.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Michael ? Michael ?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
At the bottom of the stairs, Amy catches sight of Michael at the other end of the living room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The first floor is completely flooded. ALL THE SPACE IS COVERED BY A THIN LAYER OF WATER THAT'S MIRRORING EVERYTHING IN HOUSE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The little boy has climbed up onto a stool and is scraping the paint off the mirror with a sharp knife... It was Michael who had scraped all the mirrors in the house in order to set the force of the mirrors free.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Michael !

He doesn't answer. He doesn't seem to hear her.

Amy comes down the last step.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Michael ? What are you doing?

The little boy turns around towards his mother with a big smile-

<DIRECTION>
IN THE MIRROR, HIS REFLECTION REMAINS FACING THEM.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They want to come play with us, Mommy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
Amy moves slowly towards her son.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Michael, I want you to drop that knife, do you hear me? You know very well you are not allowed to play with that, don't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
Michael looks at her in confusion and steps down from the stool.

<AMY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a good boy, now give me the knife...

Instead of obeying, Michael runs off and disappears into another room on the first floor.

Amy rushes after him.

INT. NIGHT - BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amy's cell phone, laying on the night table, begins to ring. On the display we can see the call is from Ben.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the wooden slats of the closet door, Daisy catches sight of the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She thinks about leaving the closet to answer, but remembers her mother's strict instructions about staying in the hiding place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The phone continues to ring, but no one answer it.

INT. NIGHT - FIRST FLOOR

Amy hears the phone ringing upstairs, but she cannot answer it now- She must find Michael first.

Ben's car drives down a Manhattan street.

Ben's car pulls up in front of the department store. Through the windshield, Anna catches sight of the devastated building.

Ben hangs up the phone-

	We have to get inside the Mayflower now.

</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
Anna steps out. She cannot conceal the sudden shiver that runs through her when she stands in front of the former hospital-
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	From now on, I'm going to close my eyes. Take me to the basement, to the mirror room. It has to stop where it began...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
Ben grabs her forcefully-
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, let's go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Carson, no matter what happens in there, I want you to do as I say and make sure I never get out of this place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
Ben pulls out his keys and unlocks the front door. Anna closes her eyes and follows him inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NIGHT - ENTRANCE HALL- MAYFLOWER DEPARTMENT STORE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna has barely crossed the threshold when the hall mirrors start trembling-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They can feel her presence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She tightens her grip around Ben's hand. She is anxious, and even with her eyes shut, she can sense the threatening vibes sent off by the mirrors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben is focused, gazing straight ahead as they cross the ground floor in the direction of the basement door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yet, from the corner of his eye, he cannot help but glimpse the mirrors. What he discovers goes beyond his worst nightmares-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CROWD OF MEN AND WOMEN, FLAYED ALIVE, CRAWLING AND PRESSING THEMSELVES AGAINST THE GLASS PANES, INSIDE THE MIRRORS. THEY OBSERVE BEN AND ANNA WITH BLANK, LIFELESS GAZES. SOME ARE BANGING THEIR FISTS, THEIR HANDS, AND EVEN THEIR HEADS AGAINST THE GLASS, IN AN ATTEMPT TO BREAK FREE FROM THE MIRROR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUDDENLY BEHIND HIM, ONE OF THESE VISIONS BASHES AGAINST THE MIRROR! KEEPING ITS WIDE OPENED EYES ON THEM, THE VISION STARTS LICKING THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MIRROR LIKE AN ANIMAL.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They are waiting for me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
Ben turns towards Anna and realizes that in the mirror, there's something else-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna's reflection is different- IT'S NOT THE OLD NUN ANYMORE BUT THE 12 YEARS OLD GIRL, EXACTLY AS ANNA WAS IN THE TIME OF ST. JOHNS HOSPITAL!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NIGHT -NEW JERSEY HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are back in the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amy is still searching for Michael. She goes into the kitchen to turn off the tap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Above the sink, the newspaper on the windows had been ripped as well and the hot steam is now covering the glass. A HAND PRINT APPEARS ON ONE OF THE WINDOW PANES AND SLIDES DOWN AGAINST THE GLASS...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The forces are everywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amy steps back and runs out of the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE THIN LAYER OF WATER ON THE FLOOR HAS TRANSFORMED THE ENTIRE HOUSE INTO A MIRROR EXTENDING THROUGH EACH ROOM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AN INESCAPABLE MIRROR...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of rapid, splashing footsteps catches her attention. Amy turns around and leaves the kitchen-
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Michael ?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
Michael's reflection sweeps over the water surface.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amy runs after him but stops short when she catches sight of him. Michael is hiding under the living room couch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She comes closer and bends over- THERE IS NO ONE UNDER THE COUCH!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yet, in the reflection of the wet floor, Michael is there...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He smiles at her, playfully.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN A QUICK MOVEMENT, THE LITTLE BOY'S REFLECTION BRANDISHES THE KNIFE IN EXCITEMENT AND TEARS IT THROUGH HIS MOTHER'S FACE-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AMY LETS OUT A CRY OF PAIN AS SHE BRINGS HER HAND TO HER CHEEK- THE INVISIBLE BLADE HAS SLASHED HER FACE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The blood gushes between her fingers. Michael's reflection has disappeared.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns around just in time to catch sight of the little boy's reflection escaping. His invisible footsteps splash in the water as he moves further away...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She hears Michael run up the stairs to the first floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NIGHT - STEP-IN CLOSET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Protected from the mirrors, in her hiding place in the closet, Daisy inspects the room through the wooden slats.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the bedroom door squeaks open. Daisy curls up in the corner of the closet, overtaken with fear-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's only the cat who enters the room with a meow.
</DIRECTION>
<DAISY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tiger! Come here kitty, come here...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAISY>
<DIRECTION>
She opens the door a tiny crack to let him in. The little girl takes the pet in her arms, reassuringly.

INT. NIGHT -MAYFLOWER BASEMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the dark, the surface of the water lies perfectly still. We are no longer in the New Jersey house, but in the subterranean passageways corridors of the department store.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben and Anna's silhouettes appear, walking down the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben turns on his flashlight. The lights along the corridor are too weak.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watch your step, a water pipe has burst, the whole basement is flooded.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
Ben guides Anna, with her eyes still shut, through the tunnels.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The beam of the flashlight sweeps across the walls, and the piping.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They pass the junction of the two tunnels and arrive at the demolished wall.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You stay outside...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
Anna steps over the rubble as she feels her way into the mirror room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN ALL THE MIRRORS IT'S NOT ANNA THE NUN, BUT ANNA THE LITTLE GIRL THAT WE CAN SEE-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When she places her hand against one of the mirrors, cracks appear instantly. The pressure on the other side is growing stronger and stronger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna positions herself in the center of the room, from where her reflection is multiplied to infinity from all the possible angles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She kneels down with her eyes closed.
</DIRECTION>

INT. NIGHT -NEW JERSEY HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Compared to the gloom of the basement in the department store, the second floor of the house seems to be bathed in light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael is sitting quietly in front of his room. As Narcissus did, he is observing his reflection, mirrored in the surface of the water that covers the wooden floor.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Michael ?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
Hypnotized by his mirror image, the little boy does not hear his mother's call.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amy appears at the top of the stairs and catches sight of him.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Michael... Michael, look at me... I'm right here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
Michael doesn't answer. Gently, he caresses his reflection in the surface of the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amy comes up to him slowly, determined to pull him away from his reflection...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She lays her hand on his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This time Michael reacts and turns towards her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Before he can utter a single word-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE REFLECTION OF THE HAND BECOMES REAL, GRABBING THE CHILD'S WRISTS. MICHAEL'S REFLECTION PULLS HIM THROUGH ITS SURFACE. MICHAEL DISAPPEARS INTO THE FLOOR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amy throws herself to the ground in an attempt to catch him. Too late, the little boy has been submerged in the thin layer of water covering the floor. MICHAEL HAS BEEN PULLED INTO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MIRROR!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amy sees her son struggling under the water, as if he were caught under a coat of ice.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Michael, Michael... No, no...
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
In desperation, Amy beats her fists against the floor with all her strength, trying to break through to the other side.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	MICHAEL !! NOOOOO...
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
Flying into a rage, she beats her fists again and again in an attempt to break the surface and save Michael from drowning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She sees Michael's body sinking into the depths...

INT. NIGHT - MIRROR ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Back to the subterranean world of the department store.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben is waiting in the corridor with his gun in hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the mirror room, Anna recites a prayer for strength. IN THE REFLECTION, YOUNG ANNA IS DOING THE SAME...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The mirrors around her shake more and more violently-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna remains with her eyes still shut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben sees cracks forming on the walls and the surface of the water at his feet trembling...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NIGHT - MAYFLOWER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOMETHING IS HAPPENING IN THE REST OF THE STORE AS WELL- ON EACH FLOOR, IN EVERY DEPARTMENT, ALL THE MIRRORS BEGIN TO VIBRATE UNCONTROLLABLY, TO TWIST OUT OF SHAPE, TO SWELL, TO SHRIVEL AND FINALLY-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK IN THE MIRROR ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANNA OPENS HER EYES-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALL THE MIRRORS EXPLODE!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FROM ONE AREA TO THE NEXT IN THE DEPARTMENT STORE, THE EXPLOSIONS ARE SPECTACULAR AND APOCALYPTIC.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna's eyes freeze- her pupils constrict- thousands of shards of glass are sent flying into the air, piercing through her body like a dozen sharpened daggers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The blow of the explosion causes the walls to tremble. Instinctively, Ben takes shelter behind the wall.
</DIRECTION>

INT. NIGHT - NEW JERSEY HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL'S BODY REEMERGES TO THE SURFACE!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amy clings to him and pulls him out of the water. The little boy is unconscious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She begins to shake him and to perform mouth-to-mouth resuscitation as she applies rhythmical pressure to his chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amy tries not to lose her head, determined to bring her little boy back to life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her eyes fill with tears, blurring her vision. She mustn't lose faith. She mustn't give up...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cardiac massage, mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, cardiac massage...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL REMAINS UNCONSCIOUS...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NIGHT - MIRROR ROOM / SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGEWAYS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE BASEMENT, THE CALM HAS BEEN RESTORED.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben is still crouching behind the sheltering wall of the mirror room. In the silence, he waits. He must establish beyond a doubt that it's all over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He aims his flashlight at the surface of the water-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everything seems to be back to normal. His reflection is deformed by the slight stir of the water, slowly becoming placid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben steps over the rubble to enter the mirror room-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All the mirrors have been pulverized leaving behind only the metal cage that was holding them in place. The floor is covered with thousands of pieces of mirror floating in the water, shimmering in the shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The beam of the flashlight sweeps the room in search of Anna, or her dead body-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben inspects all the dark corners behind the metal structure - The woman has vanished.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He aims his flashlight at the ceiling. The beam of light instantly reveals a dark shape hanging above him-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's her, or at least what is left of her- A POSSESSED, METAMORPHOSED, HUMAN FRAME. SHE IS BARELY RECOGNIZABLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WITH HER EYES ROLLED UPWARD, HER SLASHED FACE AND HER BODY PIERCED BY THE SHARDS OF GLASS, SHE LOOKS LIKE A DEMON, DEPRIVED OF ANY HUMAN TRAITS. THE REAL ANNA DISAPPEARED FROM THE MOMENT SHE OPENED HER EYES AND RELEASED THE FORCES OF THE MIRROR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben has no time to react before "Anna" charges at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He drops his flashlight to the ground, trying to resist her as much as he can.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HER WAY OF MOVING IS NO LONGER HUMAN. MORE LIKE A STROBOSCOPIC CONVULSION, HER MOVEMENTS ARE SOMETHING BETWEEN AN ENRAGED BEAST AND THE WORST EPILEPTIC FIT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben manages to pin the creature against the wall. "Anna" spits blood in his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He applies all his strength to immobilize her- the shards of glass dig deeper into the elderly woman's flesh, which only seems to provide her an intense pleasure...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"Anna" froths at the mouth. Her speech has become a deep, animalistic, incomprehensible gurgle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In an effortless movement, "Anna" pushes him away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her demonic strength is ten times his. Ben is merely a puppet, a rag doll that she sends flying into the air, only to crash violently against the brick walls...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blood squirts onto the surface of the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben smashes into the wall separating the mirror room from the underground passageways.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the other side, he lands on the ground, in the dark. He strives to regain consciousness...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben takes advantage of the brief respite to pull out his gun but-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"Anna" appears from the dark and, in a flash, she strikes a backhanded blow that sends the gun off into the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She lifts Ben up and throws him across the room. He rams into the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With the absence of light in the basement, Ben is defenseless. He cannot see his assailant...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben is caught by the leg and dragged backwards. His hand struggles to catch on to anything that could hold him back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, under the water, his hand lands on the gun. He grabs it, turns onto his back, and fires point-blank at "Anna".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bullets go flying through her body, but they don't stop her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben is being dragged. He manages to grab hold of one pipe after the other, trying to hold on, but the pipe gives way and breaks off from the wall, LETTING OUT A POWERFUL JET OF GAS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Once again, Ben is sent flying down the tunnel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He struggles to get back on his feet-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Apart from the sound of the flowing gas, a disturbing silence surrounds the subterranean passageways.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben makes out "Anna's" silhouette, hiding behind the leaking gas pipe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With his bloodied face, Ben is no longer the same man anymore- Something in his eyes has shifted. Rage and violence have replaced the terror and dread. He is determined to put an end to the creature, no matter what happens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He slides the weapon in his belt and steps, with his bare hands, towards what once was "Anna"...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Crouched over in the water, the demon looks up, ready to charge. Ben takes another step forward with the same determination. The creature thrusts itself against him-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CLASH IS EXTREMELY VIOLENT. Ben uses all his strength to keep his assailant's jaw at a distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a swift movement, Ben turns around AND IMPALES "ANNA" ON THE BROKEN GAS PIPE!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN A GUSH OF BLOOD THE SHARP METAL TIP PIERCES THROUGH HER STOMACH BUT-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Despite being momentarily immobilised, the demon seems unaffected by the near total destruction of its outer shell. On the contrary, it struggles more violently to escape from the trap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben moves away, keeping an eye on "Anna". He takes his gun and aims it at her. Ben is exhausted. With his arm outstretched, he is ready to shoot, waiting for the right moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The silhouette suddenly emerges from the dark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben stands by-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The demon goes through the cloud of gas- Ben fires-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE EXPLOSION IS INSTANTANEOUS. "ANNA" IS ENGULFED IN FLAMES. THE FIRE SPREADS THROUGH THE TUNNELS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben throws himself to the ground to avoid the flames.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUDDENLY, IN A DOMINO EFFECT, ONE EXPLOSION FOLLOWS THE OTHER. A BLAST OCCURS A BIT FURTHER DOWN THE TUNNEL, AND ANOTHER INSIDE THE WALLS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGEWAYS ARE ABOUT TO COLLAPSE-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cracks appear everywhere. The brick walls begin to fall apart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A part of the ceiling at the far end of the corridor caves in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben gets back on his feet and dashes for the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Totally burnt, flesh charred, "Anna" is enraged by her prey's resistance. The blazing demon runs after Ben.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind them, one after the other, sections of the walls collapse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben runs as fast as he can.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"Anna" is coming closer to him, when suddenly -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JUST BEHIND BEN, A SECTION OF THE GROUND FLOOR CAVES IN, BURYING HER UNDER A MASS OF RUBBLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben narrowly escaped the collapse. He reaches the staircase and catches sight of the exit above when suddenly-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE ENTIRE FOUNDATION OF THE BUILDING COLLAPSES OVER HIM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben finds himself crushed along the floor and penetrates the mirroring water surface DISAPPEARING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MIRROR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NIGHT - JERSEY HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All of her efforts are in vain. Amy is unable to bring back her son.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nonetheless, she continues with the same determination, refusing to accept reality.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She finally breaks down, pleading with the sky above...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MIRROR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lost and floating in this strange and unfamiliar place, Ben turns and sees Michael's body/soul which is also trapped in this parallel dimension, on the other side of the mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the distance, he can see the surface leading to the hallway of the New Jersey house. Above it, Amy tries to resuscitate Michael.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben grabs his son and holds him tightly in his arms for a moment, then pushes him towards the surface-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CHILD OPENS HIS EYES!-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NIGHT -NEW JERSEY HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL COMES AROUND, COUGHING OUT THE WATER FROM HIS LUNGS. Amy bursts into tears, sobbing with joy. She holds him tightly in her arms, with all her strength, with all her love.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holding Michael in her arms, Amy comes back for Daisy in the bedroom. She opens the closet door and finds her little girl inside. The child throws herself into her mother's arms-
</DIRECTION>
<DAISY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is over, Mom?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAISY>
<DIRECTION>
Amy throws a glance at her reflection in the mirror. Everything seems back to normal.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes sweetheart, it's over...
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
Amy holds her two children tightly, savoring this moment of joy and relief.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the window, we see the first light of dawn appearing on the horizon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DAWN - MAYFLOWER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sunbeams slice through the windowpanes of the glass dome above the entrance hall of the department store.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pigeons fly in and out...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The burnt mannequins are still standing in the middle of the ruins.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE WALLS, ALL THAT REMAINS FROM THE MIRRORS IS THEIR 1920's GOLD FRAMES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The floor has completely subsided. It looks like there was just an earthquake under the building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the middle of the pile of debris, something in the rubble begins to move-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HAND APPEARS. SOMEBODY SURFACES -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's Ben. He gasps for air. Wounded and covered in dust, it is a miracle that he has survived.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He struggles back to his feet and climbs over the blocks of concrete to regain the ground floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Limping, he crosses the entrance hall. His discovery of the absence of mirrors on the walls brings a smile to his face- He has finally triumphed over the mirrors that he once believed to be indestructible...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DAY - MAYFLOWER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben steps out of the department store, walks out of the closed off area, and reaches the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Police cars, fire trucks, and ambulances with spinning lights have surrounded the fencing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben approaches the scene. He needs medical attention. He catches sight of Lorenzo, talking to some policemen. Ben stops dead in his tracks-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE NAME LORENZO, EMBROIDERED ON THE UNIFORM, IS WRITTEN BACKWARDS...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben glances at the police vehicles and their license plates-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
How is it possible? EVERYTHING IS REVERSED.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben steps back in panic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he walks away from the scene we discover something else in the back of the ambulance-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANNA'S CHARRED CADAVER, THAT HAS BEEN DUG OUT OF THE RUBBLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DAY - TIME SQUARE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben walks up west 38th Street to Broadway and stops at the intersection of the streets, paralyzed with fear-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The activity of Time Square seems normal for an early morning, cars driving by and the eternal hustle and bustle of the pedestrians, but ALL THE SIGNS, ALL THE BILLBOARDS ARE REVERSED. AND SO IS THE DIRECTION OF THE TRAFFIC FLOW...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben turns around towards a glass building where a homeless person is sleeping-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes fill with horror-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HE CAN SEE THE REFLECTION OF THE HOMELESS MAN BUT NOT HIS OWN..
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben presses his hand against the glass. The reflection of the world surrounding him is the right way around in the mirror but he remains invisible.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He removes his hand from the mirror, leaving a clear and well- defined handprint on the reflective surface.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben slowly comes to realize what is happening to him -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IF HIS REFLECTION IS NOT THERE, IT MEANS THAT HE NO LONGER BELONGS TO THE WORLD OF THE LIVING. BEN DID NOT SURVIVE-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS SOUL IS NOW A CAPTIVE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MIRROR...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>

EXT. DAY - MAYFLOWER

Back in the ambulance, a paramedic comes to close the back door.

The vehicle starts and leaves the Mayflower.

EXT. DAY - NEW-YORK - CONTINUITY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ambulance turns on the avenue.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DAY - AMBULANCE - MOVING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the back of the ambulance, as the vehicle drives away, we discover that another corpse is laid out next to Anna's-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IT'S BEN'S BODY, COVERED WITH DUST AND DRY BLOOD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Its fingers suddenly twitch...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Was it the bumpy road?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dead fingers twitch again and-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE SHADOW, BEN'S CORPSE SLOWLY BEGINS TO STAND.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It turns its head-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEN'S EYES ARE ROLLED UPWARD, NO LONGER HUMAN...

<DIRECTION>
EVIL.
