EXT. STREET. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Legs run along the pavement. They are Mark Renton's.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just ahead of him is Spud. They are both belting along.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they travel, various objects (pens, tapes, CDs, toiletries, ties, sunglasses, etc.) either fall or are discarded from inside their jackets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are pursued by two hard-looking Store Detectives in identical uniforms. The men are fast, but Renton and Spud maintain their lead.

	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, as Renton crosses a road, a car skids to a halt, inches from him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a moment of detachment he stops and looks at the shocked driver, then at Spud, who has continued running, then at the Two Men, who are now closing in on him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He smiles.

EXT. FOOTBALL PITCH. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On a flood lit five-a-side pitch, Renton and his friends are taking on another team at football.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The opposition all wear an identical strip (Arsenal), whereas Renton and his friends wear an odd assortment of gear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Three girls -- Lizzy, Gail, and Allison and Baby -- stand by the side, watching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boys are outclassed by the team with the strip but play much dirtier.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As each performs a characteristic bit of play, the play freezes and their name is visible, printed or written on some item of clothing. (T-Shirt, baseball cap, shorts, trainers). In Begbie's case, his name appears as a tatoo on his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sick Boy commits a sneaky foul and indignantly denies it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Begbie commits an obvious foul and make no effort to deny it.

Choose rotting away at the end of it all, pishing you last in a miserable home, nothing more than an embarrassment to the selfish, fucked-up brats you have spawned to replace yourself. Choose your future. Choose life.
	</DIALOGUE>

Renton is hit straight in the face by the ball. He lies back on the astroturf. Voice-over continues.

<DIRECTION>
Spud is shooting up
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	is the pleasure of it. Otherwise we wouldn't do it. After all, we're not fucking stupid. At least, we're not that fucking stupid. Take the best orgasm you ever had, multiply it by a thousand and you're still nowhere near it. When you're on junk you have only one worry: scoring. When you're off it you are suddenly obliged to worry about all sorts of other shite. Got no money: can't get pished. Got money: drinking too much. Can't get a bird: no chance of a ride. Got a bird: too much hassle. You have to worry about bills, about food, about some football team that never fucking winds, about human relationships and all the things that really don't matter when you've got a sincere and truthful junk habit.

<SICK_BOY>

He looks down between his legs.

<DIRECTION>
He drops to his knees in front of the bowl and rolls his sleeve up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With no more hesitation he plunges his arm into the bowl and trawls for the suppositories.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It seems to take ages. He cannot find them. He sticks his arm further and further into the toilet, moving his whole body close. He strains to find it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His head is over the bowl now. Gradually he reaches still further until his head is lowered into the bowl, followed by his neck, torso, other arm, and finally his legs, all disappearing.

The cubicle is empty.

	<DIALOGUE>
	The down side of coming off junk was that I knew I would need to mix with my friends again in a state of full consciousness. It was awful: they reminded me so much of myself I could hardly bear to look at them. Take Sick Boy, for instance, he came off junk at the same time as me, not because he wanted too, you understand, but just to annoy me, just to show me how easily he could do it, thereby downgrading my own struggle. Sneaky fucker, don't you think? And when all I wanted to do was lie along and feel sorry for myself, he insisted on telling me once again about his unifying theory of life.

<RENTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I can. The truth -- well, the truth is that I've had a long-standing problem with heroin addiction. I've been know to sniff it, smoke it, swallow it, stick it up my arse and inject it into my veins. I've been trying to combat this addiction, but unless you count social security scams and shoplifting, I haven't had a regular job in years. I feel it's important to mention this.

	<DIALOGUE>
	No, actually I went to Craignewton but I was worried that you wouldn't have heard of it so I put the Royal Edinburgh College instead, because they're both schools, right, and we're all in this together, and I wanted to put across the general idea rather than the details, yeah? People get all hung up on details, but what's the point? Like which school? Does it matter? Why? When? Where? Or how many O grades did I get? Could be six, could be one, but that's not important. What's important is that I am, right? That I am.

	Hey. Right. No problem. Whatever you say, man. You're the man, the governor, the dude in the chair, like. I'm merely here. But obviously I am. Here, that is. I hope I'm not talking too much. I don't usually. I think it's all important though, isn't it?

	No. Well, yes. I have to admit it: I'm a perfectionist. For me, it's the best or nothing at all. If things go badly, I can't be bothered, but I have a good feeling about this interview. Seems to me like it's gone pretty well. We've touched on a lot of subjects, a lot of things to think about, for all of us.

It is Saturday night in a busy, city-centre pub on two levels. On a large upper balcony, overlooking the bar and floor downstairs, sit Spud, Gail, Renton, Sick Boy, Tommy, Lizzy and Begbie.

Begbie's story overlaps with the subsequent depiction of the incident.

<BEGBIE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Picture the scene. Wednesday morning in the Volley. Me and Tommy are playing pool. No problems, and I'm playing like Paul fucking Newman by the way. I'm giving the boy here the tanning of a lifetime. So anyway, it comes to the final ball, the deciding shot of the tournament: I'm on the black and he's sitting in the corner, looking all biscuit-arsed. Then this hard cunt comes in. Obviously fancied himself. Starts looking at me. Right fucking at me. Trying to put off, like, just for kicks. Looking at me as if to say, 'Come ahead, square go.' Well, you know me, I'm no looking for trouble but at the end of the day I'm the cunt with the pool cue and I'm game for a swedge. So I squared up, casual like. So what does the hard cunt do, or so-called hard cunt? Shites it. Puts down his drink, turns around and gets the fuck out of there. And after that, the game was mine.

Begbie and Tommy are playing pool.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Begbie is playing like a wizard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tommy looks defeated.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lining up for the final ball, Begbie is distracted by a large Hard Man standing at the bar staring at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Begbie stands up and walks slowly towards the Hard Man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They stand, eye to eye, for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Begbie swings the pool cue slowly into his palm.
</DIRECTION>

The Hard Man turns and leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Begbie drinks the Hard Man's pint, then pots the black with a brilliant shot.

Begbie, his story complete, finishes his pint. The others continue to stare at him, frozen as though expecting something more. Begbie smiles and throws the pint over his head.

Freeze-frame: the glass in mid-air and Begbie's smiling face.

	And that was it. That was Begbie's story. Or at least that was Begbie's version of the story. But a couple of days later I got the truth from Tommy. It was one of his major weaknesses: he never told lies, never took drugs, and never cheated on anyone.

INT. TOMMY'S FLAT. DAY

<DIRECTION>
Renton's hand flicks through a long row of videos on the floor while the sound of weights being lifted (by Tommy) emanates from nearby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Most of the videos are feature films or comedy shows, some with titles written in Tommy's hand, but two catch Renton's attention.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are 100 Great Goals and Tommy and Lizzy Vol. 1, the latter a handwritten title.

Renton looks from the video round to Tommy, who is engrossed in lifting weights.

	<DIALOGUE>
	But Begbie is playing absolutely fucking gash. He's got a hangover so bad he can hardly hold the fucking cue, never mind pot the ball. I'm doing my best to lose, trying to humour him, like, but it's not doing any good: every time I touch the ball I pot something, every time Begbie goes near the table he fucks it up. So he's got the hump, right, but finally I manage to set it up so all he's go to do is pot the black to win one game and salvage a little pride and maybe not kick my head in, right. So he's on the black, pressure shot, and it all goes wrong, big time. What does he do? Picks on this specky wee gadge at the bar and accuses him of putting him off by looking at him. Can you believe it? I mean, the poor cunt hasn't even glanced in our direction. He's sitting there quiet as a mouse when Beggars gubs him with the cue. He was going to chib him, I tell you, then I thought he was going to do me. The Beggar is fucking psycho, but he's a mate, you know, so what can you do?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The events are as follows:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Begbie and Tommy are playing pool.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Begbie, furious, miscues, goes in off, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tommy deliberately misses sitters and tries to look annoyed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Begbie lines up to play the black. It is unmissable.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the bar beyond sits a harmless young Man, wearing the same clothes as the Hard Man in Begbie's account except that they are now baggy rather than taut. He is clearly not staring at Begbie but drinks a half-pint and eats some crisps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Begbie plays, the Man bites a crisp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Begbie miscues, rips the cloth and the ball flies off the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tommy catches it and looks up to see Begbie assaulting the young Man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tommy cautiously restrains Begbie and he reaches into his jacket for a knife.

Begbie turns and for a moment looks as though he might attack Tommy.

	Yeah, the guy's a psycho, but it's true, he's a mate as well, so what can you do? Just stand back and watch and try not to get involved. Begbie didn't do drugs either, he just did people. That what he got off on: his own sensory addiction.

The glass falls into the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Screaming starts. A Woman is bleeding from a wound in her head. The Men beside her turn furiously around to look for the source of the glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Up on the balcony, Begbie stands up. The screams and shouting continue below.
</DIRECTION>

Begbie appears at the bottom of the staircase down from the balcony.
</DIRECTION>

He strides towards the bleeding Woman and begins shouting.

A mass of dancing bodies fills the floor. The music is very loud.

At the side of the dance floor sit Tommy and Spud. The look rather gloomy. There is an empty seat beside each of them. Spud is drinking heavily.

Tommy turns and speaks to Spud. His lips move but nothing is audible. Spud is not ever aware that Tommy has spoken.

Tommy bellows in Spud's ear.

Tommy's words and all subsequent conversation in the dance area of the club appear as subtitles, the character's communications somewhere between speech and mime.

	Heroin had robbed Renton of his sex drive, but now it returned with a vengeance. And as the impotence of those days faded into memory, grim desperation took hold in his sex-crazed mind. His post-junk libido, fuelled by alcohol and amphetamine, taunted him remorselessly with his own unsatisfied desire dot.

Renton notices one girl (Diane) walking on her own towards the door.

INT. TOMMY'S FLAT. NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
The lights are full on now. Lizzy sits on the bed clutching a blanket around herself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tommy hops around in his underwear, searching desperately.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All the videos are opened and scattered everywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<LIZZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean, it's 'gone'? Where has it gone, Tommy?
	</DIALOGUE>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It'll be here somewhere. I might have returned it by mistake.
	</DIALOGUE>
<LIZZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Returned it? Where? To the video shop, Tommy? To the fucking video store? So every punter in Edinburgh is jerking off to our video? God, Tommy, I feel sick.

INT. DIANE'S HOME, LIVING-ROOM. MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Renton lies submerged under a blanket.
</DIRECTION>

The sounds of a normal morning travel from a room nearby: whistles, radio, voices.

<DIRECTION>
Renton peeps over the edge of the blanket, then covers his head again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GAIL'S BEDROOM. MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spud opens his eyes. With his fingers, he feels crusted liquid around his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Abruptly he turns around: the bed is soaked in vomit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks under the cover and drops it again in revulsion.

INT. DIANE'S HOME, HALL/KITCHEN. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door swings open. A Man and a Woman, about Renton's age, sit at the kitchen table. They look up to see Renton in the doorway.

<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good Morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
<WOMAN>

Renton walks to the table and sits down.
</DIRECTION>
<RENTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, that's me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a friend of Diane's?

<RENTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	More of a friend of a friend, really.

<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right.

	Are you her flatmates?

The couple exchange a look and laugh.

	Good morning, Spud.

<SPUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Morning, Gail. Morning, Mrs. Houston, Mr. Houston.

	Morning, Spud. Sit down and have some breakfast.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SPUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry about last night -
	</DIALOGUE>
<GAIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all right. I slept fine on the sofa.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SPUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had a little too much to drink. I'm afraid I had a slight accident.
	</DIALOGUE>
<FATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, don't worry, these things happen. It does everyone good to cut loose once in a while.
	</DIALOGUE>
<GAIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This one could do with being tied up once in a while.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll put the sheets in the washing machine just now.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SPUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I'll wash them. I'll take them home and bring them back.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's no need.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SPUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's no problem.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No problem for me either.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honestly, it's no problem.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SPUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd really rather take care of it myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Spud, they're my sheets.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She takes hold of the bundle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spud does not yield.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls harder. Spud holds on. She tugs powerfully.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bundle bursts open with an explosion of vomit and excrement that covers everything in the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Only Spud remains untouched.

I guess this means I'll never get to have sex with Gail.

Renton paces briskly down the street, followed by Diane.
</DIRECTION>
<DIANE>
<DIRECTION>
I don't see why not.
</DIRECTION>
<RENTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because it's illegal.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holding hands?
	</DIALOGUE>
<RENTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, not holding hands.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In that case you can do it. You were quite happy to do a lot more last night.
	</DIALOGUE>
<RENTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that's what's illegal. Do you know what they do to people like me inside? They'd cut my balls off and flush them down the fucking toilet.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They stop at the school gates.
</DIRECTION>
<DIANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Calm down. You're not going to jail.

	Easy for you to say.

	Certainly not.

Renton walks away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you don't see me again I'll tell the police.
	</DIALOGUE>

Renton turns and walks back to her. They stand for a moment, then Renton walks away again. Diane smiles. (to herself)

	I'll see you around then.

<SICK_BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This had better be good.

<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It will be. It'll make a change for three miserable junkies who don't know what they want to do with themselves since they stopped doing smack.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SICK_BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I'm giving up a whole day and the price of a ticket, I'm just saying it had better be good. There's plenty of other things I could be doing.
	</DIALOGUE>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Such as?
	</DIALOGUE>
<SICK_BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Such as sitting in a darkened room, watching videos, drinking, smoking dope and wanking. Does that answer your question?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They sit in silence.

EXT. STATION. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The station is in the middle of a moor. There appears to be no habitation around. In the distance are some hills.

The train stands at the station.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As it pulls away, Renton, Spud, Tommy and Sick Boy are left standing on the platform, looking around.
</DIRECTION>
<SICK_BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now what?
	</DIALOGUE>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We go for a walk.

<SPUD>

	What?

<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A walk.

	<DIALOGUE>
	But where?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Tommy points vaguely across the moor.
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SICK_BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you serious?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They step across the tracks toward the vast moorland. They stop. All but Tommy sit down on rocks or clumps of heather.
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, what are you waiting for?
	</DIALOGUE>
<SPUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know, Tommy. I don't know if it's... normal.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A group of three serious Walkers trudge past from the other end of the platform, decked out in regulation Berghaus from head to foot. They tramp off towards the wilderness. The boys watch them go. Spud opens a can.
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the great outdoors.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SICK_BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's really nice, Tommy. Can we go home now?
	</DIALOGUE>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's fresh air.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SICK_BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Tommy, we know you're getting a hard time off Lizzy, but there's no need to take it out on us.
	</DIALOGUE>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doesn't it make you proud to be Scottish?
	</DIALOGUE>
<RENTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hate being Scottish. We're the lowest of the fucking low, the scum of the earth, the most wretched, servile, miserable, pathetic trash that was ever shat into civilization. Some people hate the English, but I don't. They're just wankers. We, on the other hand, are colonized by wankers. We can't even pick a decent culture to be colonized by. We are ruled by effete arseholes. It's a shite state of affairs and all the fresh air in the world will not make any fucking difference.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The three serious Walkers are receding into the distance. The boys troop back towards the platform. (v.o) At or around this time, we made a healthy, informed, democratic decision to get

Renton lies back as before.

<SICK_BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ursula Andress was the quintessential Bond girl. That's what everyone says. The embodiment of his superiority to us: beautiful, exotic, highly sexual and yet unavailable to everyone but him. Shite. Let's face it: if she'd shag one punter from Edinburgh, she'd shag the fucking lot of us.

</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lizzy's gone, Mark, she's gone and fucking dumped me. It was the video tape and that Iggy Pop business and all sorts of other stuff. She told me where to go and no mistake. I said, is there any chance of getting back together, like, but no way, no fucking way.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL WARD SITTING-ROOM. DAY
</DIRECTION>

A few elderly patients sit in armchairs watching daytime television. Renton and Spud jump and climb through an open window. Watched by the helpless patients, they calmly disconnect the television and take it with them as they leave by the same route.

INT. SWANNEY'S FLAT. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Renton and Tommy slumped side by side as before.
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>

	I want to try it, Mark. You're always going on about how it's the ultimate hit and that. Better than sex. Come on, I'm a fucking adult. I want to find out for myself.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Honor Blackman a.k.a. Pussy Galore, what a total fucking misnomer. I wouldn't touch her with yours. I'd sooner shag Col Kreb. At least you know where you are with a woman like that. Not much to look at, like, but personality, that's what counts, that's what keeps a relationship going through the years. Like heroin. I mean, heroin's got fucking great personality.

</DIRECTION>
<RENTON>
<DIRECTION>
(v.o)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Swanney taught us to adore and respect the National Health Service, for it was the source of much of our gear. We stole drugs, we stole prescriptions, or bought them, sold them, swapped them, forged them, photocopied them or traded them with cancer victims, alcoholics, old age pensioners, AIDS patients, epileptics and bored housewives. We took morphine, diamorphine, cyclozine, codeine, temazepam, nitrezepam, phenobarbitone, sodium amytal dextropropoxyphene, methadone, nalbuphine, pethidine, pentazocine, buprenorphine, dextromoramide chlormethiazole. The streets are awash with drugs that you can have for unhappiness and pain, and we took them all. Fuck it, we would have injected Vitamin C if only they'd made it illegal.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The GP examines Renton's chest and smiles. The GP turns to wash his hands. Renton pulls on his shirt and steals a prescription pad off the desk.

INT. SWANNEY'S FLAT. DAY

<DIRECTION>
Renton lies back with his eyes close. A football enters the frame to bounce off his head and out again. He opens his eyes and it happens again. Opposite him, Spud, Sick Boy and Tommy stand looking down on him. Tommy throws the ball again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PUB I. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's the first day of the Edinburgh Festival. Renton, Tommy, Spud, Sick Boy and Begbie sit drinking. They observe a young male American Tourist walk in in a bulky red anorak and glasses. He goes past them towards the toilet. Begbie stands up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PUB I, TOILET. DAY
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<RENTON>
<DIRECTION>
(v.o)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think Allison had been screaming all day, but it hadn't really registered before. She might have been screaming for a week for all I knew. It's been days since I've heard anyone speak, though surely someone must have said something in all that time, surely to fuck someone must have.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SICK_BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's wrong, Allison?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Allison points toward the bundle of dirty blankets in which her baby is wrapped. Sick Boy follows her directions.

Calm down, calm down. It's going to be all right, everything's going to be just fine.
</DIRECTION>
<RENTON>
<DIRECTION>
(v.o)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing could have been further from the truth. In point of fact, nothing at all was going to be just fine. On the contrary, everything was going to be bad. Bad? I mean worse than it already was.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Sick Boy stands over the bundle. The baby is dead.
</DIRECTION>
<SICK_BOY>
<DIRECTION>
Oh, fuck. Sick Boy reaches out to Allison.
</DIRECTION>
<RENTON>
<DIRECTION>
(v.o)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It wasn't my baby. She wasn't my baby. Baby Dawn. She wasn't mine. Spud's? Swanney's? Sick Boy's? I don't know. Maybe Allison knew. Maybe not. I wished I could think of something to say, something sympathetic, something human.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SICK_BOY>
<DIRECTION>
Say something, Mark, say something --
</DIRECTION>
<RENTON>
<DIRECTION>
I'm cooking' up. There is a silence. Renton begins scrambling around through the works.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Cook one for me, Renton. I need a hit.
	</DIALOGUE>
<RENTON>
<DIRECTION>
(v.o)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And so she did, I could understand that. To take the pain away. So I cooked up and she got a hit, but only after me. That went without saying.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Renton, Spud and Sick Boy cross the road to approach the shop.
</DIRECTION>
<RENTON>
<DIRECTION>
(v.o)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, at least we knew who the father was now. It wasn't just the baby that died that day. Something inside Sick Boy was lost and never returned. It seemed he had no theory with which to explain a moment like this.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SHOP. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Renton, Spud and Sick Boy are stuffing their pockets, as seen before. Renton's theft is interrupted by Diane's voice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello there, Mark.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Diane is standing just beside him.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Renton is speechless, but a few stolen items fall from inside his jacket down to the floor. Diane looks down. Spud and Sick Boy start to snigger. One of the Store Detectives become aware of the group. He starts walking towards them.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't tell me you were a thief.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SPUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, go easy, lady. The boy's got a habit to support.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SICK_BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Opium doesn't just grow on trees, you know.

A few more items fall from Renton's jacket as the store Detective closes in. Renton looks at Diane.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Renton and Spud are running, pursued by the Two Store Detectives.
</DIRECTION>
<RENTON>
<DIRECTION>
(v.o) Nor did I. Our only response was to keep on going and fuck everything. Pile misery upon misery, heap it up on a spoon and dissolve it with a drop of bile, then squirt it into a stinking purulent vein and do it all over again. Keep on going: getting up, going out, robbing, stealing, fucking people over, propelling ourselves with longing towards the day it would all go wrong. As seen in the opening scene, Renton is nearly hit by a car that screeches to a halt as he crosses a road. He looks at the driver, at Spud running away and the Store Detectives approaching. (v.o) Because no matter how much you stash or how much you steal, you never have enough. No matter how often you go out and rob and fuck people over you always need to get up and do it all again. Renton smiles and waits. (v.o) Sooner or later, this sort of thing was bound to happen. One of the Detectives runs straight past him, after Spud. The other Detective crashes into Renton with a mighty punch in the stomach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COURT. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spud and Renton stand in the dock. Renton's Mother and Father, Sick Boy, Begbie, and Spud's Mother (Mrs. Murphy) are among those in the gallery. The Sheriff delivers his sentence.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...because shoplifting is theft, which is a crime, and, despite what you may believe, there is no such entity as victimless crime. Heroin addiction may explain your actions, but it does not excuse them. Mr Murphy, you are a habitual thief, devoid of regret or remorse. In sentencing you to six months' imprisonment my only worry is that it will not be long before we meet again. Mr Renton, I understand that you have entered into a programme of rehabilation in an attempt to wean yourself away from heroin. The suspension of your sentence is conditional upon your continued cooperation with this programme. Should you stand guilty before me again, I shall not hesitate to impose a custodial sentence.
	</DIALOGUE>
<RENTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, your honour. With God's help, I'll conquer this affliction.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The Sheriff and Renton stare at one another for a moment. Renton turns to look at Spud, then back towards the Sheriff, who is now leaving the court. (v.o)

	<DIALOGUE>
	What can you say? Well, Begbie had a phrase for it.
	</DIALOGUE>

INT. PUB I. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pub is crowded. Around Renton are his mother, Father, Begbie, Sick Boy and Gav.
</DIRECTION>
<BEGBIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was fucking obvious that that cunt was going to fuck some cunt.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
There is a round to nodding and 'poor Spud'ing. Everyone begins to talk at once.
</DIRECTION>
<FATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope you've learned your lesson, son.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, my son, I thought I was going to lose you there. You're nothing but trouble to me, but I still love you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEGBIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Clean up your act, sunshine. Cut that shite out for ever.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You listen to Francis, Mark, he's talking sense.

<BEGBIE>
<DIRECTION>
Fucking right I am. See, inside, you wouldn't last two fucking days.
</DIRECTION>
<SICK_BOY>
<DIRECTION>
There's better things that the needle, Rents. Choose life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He winks.
</DIRECTION>
<MOTHER>
<DIRECTION>
I remember when you were a baby, even when you would never do what you were told.
</DIRECTION>
<BEGBIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But he pulled it off, clever bastard, and he got a result.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They laugh, then fall silent. Renton turns around. Behind him stands Spud's mother.
</DIRECTION>
<RENTON>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs Murphy, I'm sorry about Spud. It's wasn't fair, him going down and not me --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tears in her eyes, Mrs Murphy turns and walks away. Renton watches her go. Behind him Begbie shouts.
</DIRECTION>
<BEGBIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's no our fault. Your boy went down because he was fucking smack-head and if that's not your fault, I don't know what is.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Begbie turns back to Renton.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. I'll get the drinks in.

He moves towards the bar. Renton slips away. Renton walks through the bar towards the toilets, then out of a back door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. YARD. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Renton emerges into a narrow yard surrounded by a high wall. He looks around. The steel back gate is locked.
</DIRECTION>
<RENTON>
<DIRECTION>
(v.o)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wished I had gone down instead of Spud. Here I was surrounded by my family and my so-called mates and I've never felt so alone, never in all my puff. Since I was on remand they've had me on this programme, the state-sponsored addiction, three sickly sweet doses of methadone a day instead of smack. But it's never enough, and at the moment it's nowhere near enough. I took all three this morning and now I've got eighteen hours to go till my next shot and a sweat on my back like a layer of frost. I need to visit the mother superior for one hit, one fucking hit to get us over this long, hard day.
	</DIALOGUE>

Renton climbs the wall. He stands on top, then dives off the other side, executing a somersault in mid-air.

INT. SWANNEY'S FLAT. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

Swanney is cooking up. Renton lands on the floor behind him like a gymnast.
</DIRECTION>
<RENTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's on the menu this evening?
	</DIALOGUE>
<SWANNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your favourite dish.

<RENTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excellent.

<SWANNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your usual table, sir?
	</DIALOGUE>
<RENTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Renton sits on his usual cushion on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<SWANNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And would sir care to settle his bill in advance?
	</DIALOGUE>
<RENTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stick it on my tab.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SWANNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Regret to inform, sir, that your credit limit was reached and breached a long time ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
<RENTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In that case --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He produces twenty pounds.
</DIRECTION>
<SWANNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, hard currency, why, sir, that'll do nicely.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He swipes the notes underneath a UV forgery checker.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't be too careful when we're dealing with your type, can we?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Renton begins his search for a vein.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would sir care for a starter? Some garlic bread perhaps?
	</DIALOGUE>
<RENTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, thank you. I'll proceed directly to the intravenous injection of hard drugs, please.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SWANNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As you wish.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He hands Renton the syringe. Renton inject, then lies back on the dirty, red, carpeted floor. He lies completely still. His pupils shrink. His breathing becomes slow, shallow and intermittent. He sinks into the floor until he is lying in a coffin-shaped and coffin-sized pit, lined by the red carpet. Swanney stands over him.
</DIRECTION>
<SWANNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
An ambulance siren becomes faintly audible.

The siren is a little louder. Swanney holds Renton under his arms and drags him backwards down the steps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Swanney emerges, still dragging Renton, the siren grows louder and then an ambulance speeds by without stopping. Swanney drags Renton across the pavement and into the open door of a waiting taxi. Swanney then steps out of the taxi's other door, pausing only to tuck a ten-pound note into Renton's pocket before closing the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Renton lies on the floor of the taxi, as Swanney left him, rolling slightly as the taxi takes a corner.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOSPITAL/TAXI. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The taxi is stationary. We do not see the driver's face but his hand opens the door and then drags Renton out on to the pavement by his ankles before taking the ten pound note, getting back in the cab and driving away. Renton lies on the pavement. Two Porters life him by arms and ankles on to a trolley. We do not see the Porters's faces as they wheel Renton into the hospital.

<DIRECTION>
The Porters lift Renton from one trolley on to another, then leave him alone in the bay surrounded by the curtain. Renton lies alone. His breathing is still shallow and erratic. Around him is the usual accident and emergency paraphernalia: blood pressure machine, oxygen tap, bandages, etc. A Doctor comes in and gives Renton an injection, then leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wake up. Wake up.

Renton breathes more easily.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't feel the sickness yet, but it's in the post, that's for sure. I'm in the junky limbo at the moment, too ill to sleep, too tired to stay awake, but the sickness is on its way. Sweat, chills, nausea, pain and craving. Need like nothing else I have ever known will soon take hold of me. It's on the way.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens. Renton's Mother walks in with a bowl of soup and a piece of bread. Father watches from the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll help you, son. You'll stay with us until you get better. We'll beat this together.
	</DIALOGUE>
<RENTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe I could go back to the clinic.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. No clinics, no methadone. That made you worse, you said so yourself. You lied to us, son, your own mother and father.
	</DIALOGUE>
<RENTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At least get us some Tempazepam.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you're worse coming off that than you are with heroin. Nothing at all.

	You're staying where we can keep an eye on you.

<RENTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do appreciate what you're trying to do, I really do, but I need just one score, to ease myself off it. Just one. Just one.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Mother retreats past Father, who closes the door. The bolts go home again. Renton lies back and closes his eyes. His forehead is damp with sweat. He begins to shake. He tosses and turns, becoming wrapped up in a swathe of blankets. As he unravels them, he is astonished to find a fully clothed Begbie in the bed with him.
</DIRECTION>
<BEGBIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, this is a good laugh, you fucking useless bastard. Go on, sweat that shite out of your system, because if I come back and it's still there, I'll fucking kick it out.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Begbie laughs and covers himself up. Renton rips away the blankets, but Begbie has gone. Renton looks up. Baby Dawn is crawling across the ceiling. Renton looks down to see Diane sitting on the end of the bed. Diane sings 'Temptation' by New Order.

	<DIALOGUE>
	'Oh, you've got green eyes, oh, you've got red eyes, and I've never met anyone quite like you before.'

Renton looks back up. Dawn continues her slow crawl, leaving behind a thick rail of unidentifiable slime. Renton looks down. Sick Boy sits on the end of the bed, holding a cup of tea and a chocolate biscuit. Mother stands behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<SICK_BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a mug's game, Mrs Renton. I'm not saying I was blameless myself, far from it, but there comes a time when you have to turn your back on that nonsense and just say no.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Sick Boy takes a bit of his biscuit. Dawn crawls on. She has fangs now. Spud sits on the end of the bed, in a caricature prison uniform with arrows on it, plus a ball and chain. Dawn has claws as well. Tommy sits on the end of the bed. He looks terrible.
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>

	Better than sex, Rents, better than sex. The ultimate hit. I'm a fucking adult. I'll find out for myself. Well, I've found out all right.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Renton looks up again just as the baby drops on to his face. He tears her off and throws her into a corner. Renton's Mother and Father are washing him. Mother bends down and picks up the large, damp sponge from the corner, where it landed. She wipes her son's face with it.

INT. SOCIAL CLUB. NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Renton, his Mother and Father sit at a table in the local social club. It is a Saturday night and the club is busy. Everyone sits in rapt silence. It is not initially clear what is going on. Near the bar a Caller with a microphone calls over the PA - Two and four, twenty-four...seven...fifteen...clickety-click, sixty-six - And so on, as he draws the numbers from the drum. Everyone studies their cards, except Renton, who studies the people instead, his drink untouched. The number-calling continues until suddenly interrupted by Mother's voice.
</DIRECTION>
<MOTHER>

Mark...Mark, you've got a house. House! House! For goodness's sake, Mark. They bustle around him and pass his card to the front.

	It seems, however, that I really am the luckiest guy in the world. Several years of addiction right in the middle of an epidemic, surrounded by the living dead, but not me -- I'm negative.

	Surprise! Pa-pah!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Renton sits down and takes it in silence.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hit the artery by mistake. Common enough error, or so the quack tells us, as though that's going to make my leg grown back. Still, it could have been worse, it could have been my fucking dick. And I tell you what, in this place you get looked after: clean sheets, regular meals and all the morphine you can eat.

<RENTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SWANNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And see when I get out of here. I've got plans. Going to get myself straightened out and head off to Thailand, where women really know how to treat a guy. See, out there you can live like a king if you've got white skin and a few crisp tenners in your pocket. No fucking problem.

<RENTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure.
	</DIALOGUE>

Sick Boy is silent. He stiffens as he avoids Renton's gaze. They shift fractionally apart. RENTON tuts.

<SICK_BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck you. OK, so Tommy's got the virus. Bad news, big deal. The gig goes on, or hadn't you noticed? Swanney fucks his leg up. Well, tough shit, but it could have been worse.

<RENTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're all hear.

<SICK_BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know a couple of addicts. Stupid wee lassies. I feed them what they need. A little bit of skag to keep them happy while the punters line up at a fiver a skull. It's easy money for me. Not exactly a fortune, but I'm thinking, 'I should be coining it here.' Less whores, more skag. Swanney's right. Get clean, get into dealing, that's where the future lies. Set up some contacts, get a good load of skag, punt it, profit. What do you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
<RENTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SICK_BOY>

The montage ends on one street, then draws back to reveal the whole map of London pinned to a wall. A Man holding a telephone walks in front of the mape and belches loudly.

	I settled in not too badly and I kept myself to myself. Sometimes, of course, I thought about the guys, but mainly I didn't miss them at all. After all, this was boom town where any fool could make cash from chaos and plenty did. I quite enjoyed the sound of it all. Profit, loss, margins, takeovers, lending, letting, subletting, subdividing, cheating, scamming, fragmenting, breaking away. There was no such thing as society and even if there was, I most certainly had nothing to do with it. For the first time in my adult life I was almost content.

Heroin is in the process of being prepared for injection: heated, drawn up, etc. An arm is prepared for injection: sleeve rolled up, tourniquet bound, veins tapped, etc. Mikey forrester, Sick Boy, Spud, and Begbie look on.

<RENTON>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hadn't told anyone everything that was running through my mind about what might happen in London. There were a lot of possibilities I didn't want to talk to anyone about. Ideas best kept to myself. What no one told me was that when we bought the skag, some lucky punter would have to try it out. Begbie didn't trust Spud and Sick Boy was too careful these days, so I rolled up my sleeve and did what had to be done.

	This was his nightmare. The dodgiest scam in a lifetime of dodgie scams being perpetrated with three of the most useless and unreliable fuck-ups in town. I knew what was going on in his mind: any trouble in London and he would dump us immediately, one way or another. He had to. If he got caught with a bagful of skag, on top of that armed robbery shit, he was going down for fifteen to twenty. Begbie was hard, but not so hard that he didn't shite it off twenty years in Saughton.

<DIRECTION>
The deal is done. The Man hands over the money and waits as it is counted, then leaves with the drugs. (v.o)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We settled on sixteen thousand pounds. He had a lot more in the suitcase, but it was better than nothing. And just for a moment it felt really great, like we were all in it together, like friends, like it meant something. A moment like that, it can touch you deep inside, but it doesn't last long, not like sixteen thousand pounds.

</DIRECTION>
<BEGBIE>

<BEGBIE>

	Not sorry enough for being a fat cunt.

<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck you. If you can't hold a pint, you shouldn't be in the pub, mate. Now fuck off.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Begie drops the remaining three pints. As the Man looks down to the falling glasses, Begbie punches him in the face and knees him in the groin. A fight breaks out between the Man and Begbie. Sick Boy rushes forward to restrain Begbie. Renton sits still, not even looking at the fight or what follows. His eyes are fixed on the bag while his hands fiddle. Begbie stabs Spud in the hand.

	<DIALOGUE>
	And anyone in my way gets it, fucking gets it. Everybody hear that? Everybody happy?

Nobody says anything. Renton is seated as before, avoiding Begbie's gaze. Begbie addresses him.

Renton holds out the bag. Begbie takes it. Now Renton selects a cigarette and hands it over to Begbie. Begbie inhales deeply and then blows the smoke towards Renton

Renton lies awake, sharing a bed with Sick Boy, who is asleep. Spud and Begbie lie on the other, both asleep. Begbie has an arm draped over the bag, holding it close. Renton gets up and goes to the small bathroom. He puts the light on above the mirror and looks at himself. He washes his face and drinks a glass of water, then walks back to the bedroom. Renton pulls on his jacket and shoes. He stands over Begbie, then reaches carefully down to life Begbie's arm up. As he does so he realizes that Spud is watching him. They say nothing. Renton takes the bag. Begbie stirs but does not wake.

My so-called mayes. But Begbie, I couldn't give a shit about him, and Sick Boy, well, he'd have done the same to me if only he'd thought of it first, and Spud, well, OK, I felt sorry for Spud -- he never hurt anybody.

I'm cleaning up and I'm moving on, going straight and choosing life. I'm looking forward to it already. I'm going to be just like you: the job, the family, the fucking big television, the washing machine, the car, the compact disc and electrical tin opener, good health, low cholesterol, dental insurance, mortgage, starter home, leisurewear, luggage, three-piece suite, DIY, game shows, junk food, children, walks in the park, nine to five, good at golf, washing the car, choice of sweaters, family Christmas, indexed pension, tax exemption, clearing the gutters, getting by, looking ahead, to the day you die.
