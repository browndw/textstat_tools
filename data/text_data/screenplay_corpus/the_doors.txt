PAM glancing through Jim's notebooks as they sit on his sleeping bag with a lantern and bunsen burner, overlooking moon, ocean, scudding clouds and a vast forest of television antennas. Fires burn from the beach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the notebooks, at intervals during the conversation, we see powerful sketches colored in visionary hallucinogenic William Blake mode with writing between. Books are everywhere -- panning Kerouac, Ginsberg, Nietzsche, Rimbaud, Mailer, Artaud, mythological works, shamanistic books, a library of stolen ideas.

</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's the medicine man who starts in a peyote trance. And he gets everyone in the tribe going and they share in his vision and it heals them. It's the same in all cultures -- Greeks, Jesus. Some Indians say the first shaman invented sex. He's the one who makes you crazy.

<PAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. Experience. Freedom. Love... Now. Peyote's like love. When it's given it's blessed. When it's sold it's damned. I like peyote. I like acid, it's easier to get. I like the spiritual voyage. The first time I did acid I saw God. I did. I had a friend who was Christ. And he was Judas too. I suddenly knew the secret of everything -- that we're all one, the universe is one. And that everything is beautiful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAM>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it? I don't know. I think you're alive by confronting death -- by experiencing pain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<PAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you're alive by recognizing beauty -- seeing truth because when you discover truth you discover what love is... we're all saying the same thing. It's "love me and I'll love you."

</PAM>
<JIM>

	It's only thru death that you know life. Jesus, medicine men heal people by sacrificing their own life.

<DIRECTION>
DOCUMENTARY TYPE SHOTS of TEENAGERS, HIPPIES, LONGHAIRS, running summer rampant, banging tambourines. COPS busting kids against cars on the street as PARENTS go by rolling up their windows. The action was on the street. LIGHT MY FIRE carries over the montage.

"THE DOORS -- BAND FROM VENICE" on the marquee... moving down to a motley crew of TEENAGE GIRLS, underage, trying to get past the BOUNCER. The sounds of BREAK ON THROUGH carry past when the doors open and close admitting a SAILOR.

INT. LONDON FOG - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
BREAK ON THROUGH blasting out at us from a sleazehole -- half full -- BIKERS, SAILORS, HOOKERS, a baseball game on the TV. A dance floor the size of a bed, the DOORS on a tiny platform above the bar, London newspapers on the wall.

(3)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Some groupies have formed a small fan club at the base of the stage, muscling past PAM, but most people ignore them, drinking, arguing, dancing to their own fuckbeats. Possibly this has something to do with the fact that JIM sings with his back to all of them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOHN looking over furious at RAY who mutters under the music.

Jim jumps around violently to the front, getting the attention of all. Rubbing his leather pants against the mike stand, leaning against it, not yet comfortable with the extrovert side of himself, eyes closed, but starting to enjoy it. He sings to Pam.

EXT. SUNSET STRIP -- THAT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CU moving down -- the "LOVE" is on the marquee at the famous WHISKY A GO GO as we move down to see JIM, PAM, and the DOORS. Jim jumps through the TEEMING TRAFFIC (horns, anger) right in front of a COP CAR, crossing to a long line of teenage FANS dying to get into the club.

On the crowd. A few raise their hands, smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We IRIS in on the Doors suddenly -- a strange sound -- REVERSE IRIS on Jim -- feeling it now. The peyote.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JIM's POV -- Pam irising out. This strange sound in his ears -- a rattle of an Indian gourd, similar to what we heard in the car in Arizona when Jim was a boy. Now a distant Indian drum beating. The beginning strains of THE END dribble in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DESERT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A dented RED CHEVROLET fishtails on a dry mudflat, whipping up dustdevils.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They're all LAUGHING (strange noise) -- in a circle somewhere on the edge of a precipice in deep arroyos and magnificent rocks and cacti...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A football huddle of faces - RAY, JOHN, ROBBIE, JIM -- the four DOORS... laughing with the first mad impulse of the peyote.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAM is vomiting her brains out as DOROTHY tries to comfort her on the edge of a cliff... Jim panthers up the dune.

Jim holds his head. Feels the ride.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	WOA!! It's fast.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
JUMP CUTS: Jim and Pam are touching each other. Face. Shadows. Sand falls from Pam's hand. Jim turns to hawk at a bird. "Hawk! Hawk!" Then Pam is dancing alone on the dune.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Abruptly Jim is back in the circle with the Doors in a sense torn between them and Pam. EXTREME CLOSEUPS of their faces, their eyes, the tensions of the trip tearing apart their teeth as they go from the laughing to the dangerous part.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When the serpent appears, his head is ten feet long and five feet wide. He has one red eye and one green eye. He's deadly and he's seven miles long. As he moves -- on his scales is written all the history of the world, all people, all actions, all of us our little pictures on the scales, God it's big! -- and it's eating as it moves all the time, devouring, digesting consciousness, power, a monster of energy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
John shutters -- as does Robbie and Ray. Jim seems possessed.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We must kiss the snake on the tongue, if it senses our fear, it will eat us instantly. But if we kiss it without fear, the snake will take us through the garden and out the gate. To our freedom -we must ride this snake. To the end of time.

	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No no no John John. God is crazy too. God is part insane as well as sane. Not in control all the time. Dionysus was the God of the wine. He made ecstasy but he also made madness. Madness is all right. That's what you want, isn't it, isn't it? Where's that joint?

A BIRD of prey in the sky.

FLASHBACKS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAR - MOVING - DESERT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JIM, 4, in the back of a car in the desert -- looking back...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the overturned truck, the bodies in the road... at the older Indian looking at him... finally at the dying Indian... his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MORRISON HOME - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Somewhere. The child alone. On the living room floor. Drawing his sketches in a book. MOM's feet moving past -- then DAD'S feet. We may sense a subtle shift in mood when the parents come in -- from the boy's eyes which never leave the sketch he is drawing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DESERT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An OLD WOMAN is beckoning to him from an opening in the face of the mountain... then she's gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JIM bounds towards the crevice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ROCK PALACE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is in an isolated cathedral of rocks. The CRONE, muttering, leaving through another crevice. Suddenly a MOUNTAIN LION is visible, stretched hugely across a rock. It growls ferociously, upset, and suddenly shoots out the back of the cave. Silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jim, thunderstruck, gaping. A gallery of ancient INDIAN PETROGLYPHS surround him on all sides. Curious, oblong figures, buffalo, sacred deer and bear, creatures of the hunt; hunters and their weapons, rain clouds, masked deities proclaiming the answers to the Mysteries, the story of Creation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Camera weaving up to see one of the faces of the deities -- staring at him from the wall -- an eagle's face...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DOORS SONG There's danger on the edge of town Ride the King's highway Weird scenes inside the gold mine Ride the King's highway west, baby
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of a rattle -- "shichishichi" -- he realizes he's being watched. By what? He whips his eyes everywhere. A large LIZARD perches on a boulder assesses him calmly, tatters of a former skin clinging to its throat, spits a forked tongue and drills its black pearly eyes into his skull... Now the sound of the Bull-Roarer, whipping the air, announcing the appearance of the shaman.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jim's struck with an overwhelming sense of... awe... ancient mysteries. He turns. The lizard is looking at him.

<DIRECTION>
The GHOST of the DEAD INDIAN is also looking at him. We are looking at JIM from its point of view -- a blur of light, some headdress, a sense of skins... music drops back, no lyrics... the voice is old, familiar, possible Spanish descent dialect or huararchi.
</DIRECTION>
<INDIAN_GHOST_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...you are a prince among white men, yet you are a warrior among us. You are ready now. Go out "walk with the pain of the world, travel to the end of the wind" -- and change it for all men as you were born to do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIAN_GHOST_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The voice, the pretense, -- the glow too quickly fades -- leaving Jim so alone, not sure what he has heard, yet he knows he has heard, and he knows he has seen -- and once you have seen, it will never be the same again. His eyes.

DOORS SONG Ride the snake Ride the snake, to the lake The ancient lake The snake is long, seven miles Ride the snake He's old, and his skin is cold
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Camera pulling out from his eyes. There's something different tonight. Something in the air. His eyes are open, he's facing outward, gripping the mike for his life, hair falling in his face, dripping sweat, we sense all his soul concentrated in what he has to say.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cliques of GROUPIES have staked claims at the foot of the stage, eyes fucking him as he writhes, spreading his legs. Every twitch, every moment he sucks out the tension on the musical interludes generates a whip of a reaction in his audience.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nobody is moving in the club. The DANCERS are still, the GO GO GIRLS in their white plastic boots and dresses hang motionless in their gilded cages. Even the WAITRESSES have stopped, frozen with their trays, denying something is going to happen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAMELA, DOROTHY... JERRY from the Fog, also the manager of this place, watches from the balcony, shaking his head, doesn't understand. Panning to two RECORD TYPES with him -- JAC HOLZMAN, distinguished six footer, suit, and PAUL ROTHCHILD, funky, pigtailed, ex-con, early 30s.

The band has come together fully now. ROBBIE'S fingers sliding across the trembling strings, staring at the ceiling, wandering around the darkened portions of stage left, he feels Jim -- echoes him back with his flamenco-blues guitar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOHN on drums, reading Jim's moods, throws in the spontaneous and violent riffs that keep it savage. He literally tortures Jim's ears with his drums.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And RAY, concentrated with his nodding head like a big flamingo over his keyboard, mixing it up, throwing curves, yet also -- and more delicately -- torturing Jim with the messianic organ sounds that shriek in his ears. There is something of Merlin in Ray -- the alchemist knowing how to play Jim.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And JIM -- "that sneaky silent lithe flowing flexing animal" -- ready at last to share both his body and his soul with the world, to live out the words of the Indian prophet... to lead.

The SCREAMS primal, pure Jim -- Indian savagery ripped from the depths of his soul, of his pain -- bouncing off the walls...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the AUDIENCE gasps, shocked, stunned...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the guitar hits a high, horrid reverb, JIM in slightly SLOW MOTION suddenly tightens his backbone as if electrocuted and shoots violently backwards, hitting the floor like a puppet cut from his string -- we sense Jim himself has crossed a barrier now, gone into yet another stage of his performance, a stage from which he can never return. Like the gunfighter who has killed his first man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RAY sees it instantly where it's going, hits the organ! Robbie and John follow. the instruments EXPLODE all at once trying to bury Jim in his primal unmistakeable scream.

The CLUB in shock. Tribal taboo broken in one instant. Jerry exploding off the balcony toward the stage...

Pamela, extremely moved and impressed, and Dorothy... the go- go girls, as jaded as they come, are stunned tension... the groupies love it.

A staged 16mm. grainy shot of JIM and PAMELA, RAY and DOROTHY, JOHN, ROBBIE and their TWO NEW GIRLFRIENDS wandering thru the CROWD sharing the spirit. Pam and Jim fool around -- laughing -- tickling each other for the home movie camera shot by Ray... Pam is goofy, makes funny faces, teases him running a flower under his nose, thru his hair, then trips him. He chases her across the lawn.

The CROWD is "beautiful" -- candles, incense sticks, flowers, vibes of peace and love.

JIM looking out at the MOB with the other DOORS and PAMELA. The look on his face is ironic.

His POV -- the YOUNG GIRLS' FACES, arms grasping at the windows like tentacles of a poisonous hydra, their faces deformed by SILENT SCREAMS (we hear faint strangled shrieks below the song)... POLICE and SECURITY pressing them back, linking arms to clear a path for the Doors.

Their voices distorting. A GIRLCHILD squeezing thru the cordon with the fatal bullet. In slightly SLOW MOTION, Jim seeing her come... as she glues herself hip to hip, lip to lip with Jim, her hands clawing at his leather pants. It takes TWO COPS to peel her off. Pamela furious. Jim is gracious with everyone, signs patiently, talks, kisses, shakes hands with the boys, lets them touch his hair, his body, poses for a picture, seems to like it.

ROBBIE a spearmint turtleneck, beads, long sideburns, JOHN in red velveteen head to foot with a tie-dye splotch on the front of it. Their hair's being violated enough by a nervous gay black HAIR DESIGNER to make them totally self-conscious and nervous about their first live TV appearance -- all except JIM who remains in his signature black leather with the silver navajo belt and shiny spangles -- watching a portable TV... A GIRL leaving his side, crossing Pamela. Eye contact between them speaks of Pamela's jealousy.

</JOURNALIST_1>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like that -- "boozy apocalyptic" -- you're a word man, but how does your newspaper influence young people to think about Vietnam? Who's sending the soldiers over there to die? The establishment -- right? Your newspaper -- right? That seems to me a lot more dangerous than the stuff we do.

	Oh, it was a... horrible car crash... in the desert in the fifties, Arizona... ran right into a truckload of Indians... Navajos, they were lying out on the road, all bleeding, and I was with my Grandma and Grandad, we were banged up and all... and I was looking at my Dad and he was lying there... but his throat was severed and there was air coming out.

	It works you know. You drink blood the right time of the moon... they used to dance in the forests naked. I think that's what offended the Puritans and led to the Burnings. They were a sexual threat to their male order like the Bacchae -- five days a year for Dionysus, they used to wander the hills in ancient Greece, the first witches, clans of wild women fucking, looting, eating animals raw, the wine in their blood running hot -- looking for Dionysus... to tear him to pieces -- isn't that wild?

INT. PHOTOGRAPHIC STUDIO - NEW YORK - ANOTHER DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GLORIA STAVERS, beautiful 30ish ex-Vogue model shooting Jim for her layout. It's not going well. He's resisting, the attitude negative to be photographed, compounded by the acid it seems he's on.
</DIRECTION>

(taking his shirt off)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You remind me of a Russian peasant. I see you standing in a wheat field. The pride, the arrogance. You love to look at yourself don't you. You love yourself.

	<DIALOGUE>
	...good... big cat stalking...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLORIA>
<DIRECTION>
JUMP CUTS -- photos going off... JIM starting to pout narcistically, Jagger-like, for camera -- a bare-chested pose, long lion's mane of hair streaming down to his shoulders. She's shooting rapidly talking him thru the trip. Her sentences falling on separate cuts of Jim. As we hear the backbeat of PEOPLE ARE STRANGE.
</DIRECTION>
<GLORIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...the camera is like a roulette wheel Jim. It becomes whoever you want it to be -- a woman you want to seduce, a man you want to kill, a mother you want to upset, a wife you want to lie to or love, whatever you want it to be, it is...

</GLORIA>
<JIM>
<DIRECTION>
(pausey, paranoid)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are the Doors.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
He resists, he goes with it, push pull, prowling her loft on the acid, a bottle of cognac in one hand -- changing from shot to shot like a chameleon, free, wild, vicious, obscene.
</DIRECTION>
<GLORIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forget the Doors. It's you they want, Jim. You're the Doors.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We do everything together.

</JIM>
<GLORIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You control the audience, like dogs, manipulate them Jim, one picture can control a million people, be anything you want -- growl at them, be ugly, be frightened, be selfish. Be man, woman, whild, animal. Live, die, return again. Anything you want. Everything is permitted.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLORIA>
<DIRECTION>
A weird dance ensuing between them -- teasing, enticing. He runs away, writhes along her wall, being photographed inch by moving inch. He crawls to her. She gets down with him on the floor, straddling him, photographing. Then he straddles her as she shoots him from her back. They kiss, flirting. He growls like an animal... dives into her closet... tearing open the doors, flinging away hanging clothes, he finds her white fur coat and puts it on... JUMP CUT -- him as he moves to her full-length MIRROR, contorting himself. She slides up behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<GLORIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go on look at yourself, fall in love with yourself. You're your own audience now Jim. They want you. Worship and love and adore you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLORIA>
<DIRECTION>
A pause. She wants him. No longer so cool.

<DIRECTION>
Our camera dwells on Jim in the mirror, closer, closer -- the image and the reality, which is which anymore -- where does it end?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Great Jim Morrison, The Shaman, then Pamela, Patricia, Gloria, a series of women who face after face fill the ancient gallery, interchangeable masks as PEOPLE ARE STRANGE climaxes and JIM's face SPINS OUT OPTICALLY TO:

JIM'S FACE on a series of MAGAZINES twirling -- "SIXTEEN", "GLAMOUR", ROCK MAGAZINES, etc. flowering out into:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DOWNTOWN LOFT - NEW YORK - NIGHT (WINTER)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Style vampires drink and grope and drug and dance under the staccato blips of strobe lights. Artists and intellectuals, groupies and debutantes, everyone on display, as contrived and replicated as one of the Warhol prints of Elvis or Marilyn and Mao on the walls...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FISHEYE POVS -- hearkening back to the acid trip -- as JIM wanders through the dream, drinking, smoking, swallowing pills. PEOPLE look at him, talk to him (AD LIBS) but drugs distort everything and their voices are foreign, incoherent and they disappear. "PEOPLE ARE STRANGE" continuing:

INT. ROOM - LIMBO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jim peering into a room somewhere -- one of Warhol's FILMS is playing on a wall -- a man sleeping, eating...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A GLIMPSE OF VIETNAM WAR FOOTAGE on a TV monitor -- B-52s dropping bombs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A fat little PR MAN grabbing Jim's arm, leaning in, distorted.
</DIRECTION>
<PR_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
(cool)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must meet Andy Warhol, Jim. He's more than an artist. Andy is art. Bright people in America wonder -- does Andy imitate life, or does life imitate Andy. The meeting of two kings. Yes, Come.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PR_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
PAMELA is suddenly there, laughing, nuttily introducing a handsome strapping TOM BAKER, a charismatic actor, and a COUNT, suave, urbane, on heroin. Her voice lost in the jabber -- their names sound as if they're in a bottom of a tank. PAMELA seems so impressed with the high life of New York.
</DIRECTION>
<PAMELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh Jim this is Tom... Baker, he's an actor, he was in Andy's movie and this is Count Ruspoli. He lives in Paris, but he's Italian. He's from a very famous family over there. They're seven hundred years old.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAMELA>
<COUNT>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi Jim, you are great... I see you at Ondine's with Bobby and Jimmy. It...

PR guy stays there, introduces himself to the count.

</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Love your movies man. What a great penis...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
Tom is obviously a major druggie. A popper -- joint trade- off going off.

RAY's face leaning in distorted.

<RAY>

	Come on, we're splitting man. Dorothy's waiting at the door. We'll get a bite at Max's and...

JOHN DENSMORE appearing with a wasted looking ROBBIE who is giggling, high, and with a NEW GIRLFRIEND in tow.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get outta here man. This is fucking weird man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
The PR MAN is still next to Jim, jumping up and down excitedly waving across the room at nothing in particular. As the PHOTOGRAPHERS try to get Jim and the Doors in a photo opportunity.

	Right this way Jim. Andy's in the bedroom.

A wasted, emaciated Edie Sedgewick type floats into Jim's fractured POV -- introducing a MAN with a crew cut and silk suit.
</DIRECTION>
<EDIE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey Jim, this is Jake Johnson, you remember Jake Johnson -- the astronaut, he's just got back from outer space.

Tom Baker brings a tall, incredible looking BLONDE in black leather towards him.

<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey where's my joint?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a roach goes back)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's this chick sings with the Velvet Underground, Andy's band. She says she can drink you under the table.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
They stare at each other like two cats. Eye level stares that go on and on. She finally hisses in a German accent.
</DIRECTION>
<NICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm Nico. It's boring tonight. Some of us are going downtown to a new club. You want to come?
	</DIALOGUE>

A voice to kill, looks to undress, fully as tall as Jim.

	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on man! I thought we were gonna be a band, the four of us -- and party all night, rock and roll!

(laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could never keep up with you Jim. I couldn't make the music.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
Jim's eyes briefly on -- Pamela giggling with the French Count, putting her hand on his arm as she laughs. Innocent, nothing meant but a moment...
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
<DIRECTION>
(desperate mockery, grabs Ray)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't go. Don't leave! You can't leave. I don't know what will happen. It might be Death.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on Jim, this isn't our scene, these people are vampires. We gotta stick together man, the four of us. Let's make the myths man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
A moment, strange. Slightly SLOW MOTION. Ray tapping Jim's shoulder goodbye... Robbie and John's faces passing on. As if they're parting -- in a symbolic way. Jim blinking in the same SLOW MOTION, looking. Nico is gone -- but Tom is there, across the room, waving.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The INDIAN SHAMAN looks like he's standing there in a corner. Jim, ripped, heads for him, but the PR WOMAN cuts him off. Jim forgets he saw the Indian.
</DIRECTION>
<PR_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right here Jim, right here. Andy's waiting. You know what you have in common is uniqueness.

<DIRECTION>
DOORS SONG Strange days have found us Strange days have tracked us down They're going to destroy Our casual joys We shall go on playing or find a new town
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Past a cache of QUEENS in white leather ogling Jim, one of them coming over boldly, chatting him up (AD LIB dimly heard), them grabbing his crotch and kissing him. Jim rearing back, laughing but wary. Past the RICH LADIES dripping with jewels and faces peeled from Brazilian sleep tanks and Swiss knives.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Past a YOUNG MAN dressed in Jim Morrison leather pants with his hair and eye make-up, a warped image of Jim, smiling back at him.

INT. BEDROOM - SAME NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A quieter room, drugged out, the PR GUY cheerily leading JIM, stepping over SLEEPING BODIES, over fur coats strewn across the floor... to a MAN with white hair like a circus clown, his back to us, talking with some black-tied EUROPEAN ARISTOCRATS looking so cool.
</DIRECTION>
<WARHOL>

</PR_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
ANDY turning at the interruption. He looks like a chic voodoo doll. Holding an incongruous gold telephone in his arms like a teddy bear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slightly SLOW MO as Warhol's black empty eyes confront Jim -- a pit of nothingness in them, amnesia, death. In Jim's SLOW MOTION reaction we read what he sees. Andy going on with his story, to the group that includes TOM BAKER.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...but so many people showed up, the paintings were getting crushed, so they took them all down... um, it really looked great y'know... maybe uhhh...

<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...the walls. The blank walls. Andy was the art. Should do a show. Just walls. Today it's really about people, not what they do. It's the astronaut that matters, not the voyage, the actor, not the movie -- how do I say, it's the trip, not arriving.
	</DIALOGUE>

Andy is looking at Jim. Jim at Andy.

	We'd just love to have you in our movies Jim, you're so beautiful, you'd be so good, you mmmm, here... this is for you Jim.

Andy shows his eyes, gives Jim the gold telephone he's carrying.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Edie gave this to me and said mmmmm, I could talk to God with this. But I don't really have anything to say. So... mmmm now you can talk to God. Oh hi!

EXT. NEW YORK STREET - NIGHT (WINTER)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SNOW on the streets... a group of DRUGGIES staggering in the snowbanks, throwing snowballs, stupid giggling, wheezing puffs of cold air...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jim throws the golden telephone into the trash and pees on it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IRIS SHOTS continue -- PAMELA laughing battily with TOM BAKER who's putting the make on her... The COUNT is on heroin.

JIM passing a vodka bottle back and forth with NICO hitting a stash of ups. They fall in the snow, mad Russian winter.

BLACK & WHITE IRIS SHOTS continue -- imagistic, disassociative.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LONG CORRIDOR -- COUPLE staggering down the red carpets, champagne bottles in hand. The COUNT gets lost.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAM laughing -- suddenly alone, notices, goes looking for Jim... floating down this endless corridor with white doors and red carpet.

<DIRECTION>
INT. ELEVATOR

NICO stripping... a superb body... riding the floors...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jim taking an amyl nitrate with her... laughing... Nico with that crazed German laugh... PAMELA pushing the elevator buttons wildly...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The elevator opening on her. From Pamela's POV -- Nico down on her knees, her blonde head buried in Jim's leather pants... Jim pinned against the back wall, smiling dopically, eyes barely registering Pam... who screams loud and long, hiding his eyes... not wanting to know... The images faster and more fragmented: Pam beating at Jim wildly. He's laughing. Nico's laughing. The Aristocrats in the hallway are laughing. The world is laughing with its madness.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An eager rowdy CROWD chants DOORS! DOORS! DOORS! DOORS! to a stage without the Doors. TECHIES are moving amplifiers, running sound checks, stalling time, the MANAGER SIDDONS gauging the crowd, nervous. RICH GIRLS and LOCAL HONCHOS have backstage passes. COPS crawling over the stage, the PROMOTER of the concert trying to get the crowds attention.

<DIRECTION>
INT. SHOWER ROOM - SAME NIGHT

The Crowd NOISE still carries, echoing. JIM leads PATRICIA to a quiet, isolated stall where they can be alone. Tapping the magazine, sincerely moved by what he reads.

<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Lord Byron"? Really. You think? You like the poems?

His look is right at her. Silence. Patricia knows he won't talk. Through the pause we hear the crowd chanting, bigger and bigger -- "MORRISON MORRISON MORRISON!" She's excited, wanting to make love here, now. He's cooled out, however.

Jim shakes his head, weary. Suddenly he's scared inside.

<JIM>

	I want to live, Patricia. I don't wanna die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
Jim's ironic eyes, to the ceiling. Laden with a power to which he has married himself yet brave, resisting as she pulls his zipper down and goes to her knees in front of him. Shaking his head.

THE DOORS on stage, JIM - eyes masked, facing death at a mock execution, in full black leather armor.

The famous drum roll, tension building. Sudden sound of guitar. Jim crumples to the ground. Blood shooting from his mouth.

The audience is enrapt. Jim suddenly jumps up, looses the blood curdling scream of an aroused demon and the band bangs into Willie Dixon's BACK DOOR MAN.

	OH YEEEEAAAAHHHHHHHHHH! AYYYYYYAAAAAMMMMAAA BACK DOOR MAN.

The FANS go wild, to the farthest reaches of the arena, as he grabs his crotch and shakes it at them. INSTAMATICS flashing rapidly as the KIDS press forward at Jim fondling the mike stand, sliding up and down its smooth shaft.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Well the men don't know But the little girls unnerstan'...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM_DOORS>
<DIRECTION>
Joints sail onto the stage at his feet, ready to be smoked. A TEENAGE BOY & GIRL make a break thru the cordon of COPS at the front of the stage, heading for Jim. The Cops chase them down mid-stage, and wrestle them back to the edge -- throwing them back into the audience.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM_DOORS>

</JIM_DOORS>
<DIRECTION>
Danger fills the air, electric. Jim strutting, Indian like, up to one of the Cops, whipping off his hat and flipping it to the Crowd, which roars with approval. A couple Cops looking at Jim, sensing they're being challenged but not sure how. They shuffle and look offstage for direction. Their apparent impotence brings redoubled jeering from the Kids.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RAY, next to his stick of incense on the organ, shares a look with JOHN as they head into the instrumental break in the song. There's something different about Jim -- more demonic, more driven -- a spirit has taken him over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RAY'S POV -- JIM catching his look, but no recognition in those eyes. They're dark pools, like Warhol's eyes. He turns away, taking the mike and off the cuff rapping improvisationally with the backbeat, keeping poetic meter.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wanna tell you 'bout something that happened just a few minutes ago right here in New Haven. This is New Haven isn't it? New Haven, Connecticut, United States of America?

The CROWD yells in acknowledgement, one stoned TEENAGER naked from the waist up and ripped on beer, yelling out.

	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE_S>
<DIRECTION>
Jim ignores it, sits on the stage, lights a cigarette. Long pause, tension building. Their catcalls for "Light My Fire" die out as Jim faces them down. They wait... not knowing what happens next.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
<DIRECTION>
(finally)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well I was with this girl backstage, y'know. We got to talking and we wanted some privacy, so we went into this shower stall. We weren't doin' anything y'know jes' standing there and talking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
The AUDIENCE laughing, the band continuing to play, John adding emphasis to Jim's words with various shots and rolls. Camera moving over the crowd picking out the KIDS, sensing the anarchy dormant in their faces.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and then this little man came in there, this little man in a little blue suit and a little blue cap...

More COPS turning to face Jim from front stage, getting the point now. RAY sees it coming...

	And he said -- "Whatcha doin' there?" I said, "nuthin'" and he said, "Well you better get outta there or..." "Or what" I asked him...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
The AUDIENCE has now grown deadly silent. Nearly every cop is facing JIM as he uses his dumb Southerner voice. RAY's eyes warning JIM.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And he started pushing me and I pushed back and he didn't like that so he reached back there and got out his little can of mace. And sprayed it right in my eyes. And blinded me. Why? Cause I was alone in a room with a lady doing what he would like to be doing if he could ever get it up without a gun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
The LIGHTS coming on suddenly, the AUDIENCE seething. Shouts of "Fuck em! Right on!"

CROWD roars. A POLICE LIEUTENANT in his 50's, grey hair, beefy, marches out onto the stage, standing next to Jim, arms akimbo. A SECOND COP joins him.

Ray rolling the music out into a silence as Jim sticks the mike in the officer's face, defiantly.

Ray and Siddons are pushed aside by other cops. The crowd is going nuts. Chairs are thrown. Kids rushing onto the stage where the Cops beat them back.

All during this, snickering laughter from the onlooking half- dozen POLICE OFFICERS gathered to watch. Jim waits, then with great claim, in a quiet voice:

JIM drinks... an ugly cough. Silence. In this puffy wrack and ruin there is still the ironic tones and sweet delight of the boy amazed and amused by it all. We hear the ghostly CROWD still cheering.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I drink so I can talk to assholes. This includes me. Let's just say I was testing the bounds of reality -- that's-all -- I was curious... I kinda always preferred to be hated. Like Erich Von Stroheim in the movies... the man you loved to hate... it's meant to be ironic, courage wants to laugh. Y'know it's essentially a stupid situation. I go out on a stage and I howl for people. In me they see what they want to see -- some say the Lizard King, whatever that means, or some black-clad leather demon whatever that means... but really I think of myself as a sensitive, intelligent human being but with the soul of a clown which always forces me to blow it at the most crucial moment...

	a fake hero... a joke the gods played on me... it's okay, I accept the joke... and smile. Death old friend, death and my cock, I can forgive my injuries in the name of wisdom, luxury, romance. Words got me the wound and will get me well. All join now in lament of my cock, a tongue of knowledge in the feathered night. Boys get crazy in the head and suffer. I sacrifice my cock on the alter of silence.

The ENGINEER looking at him puzzled. Has Jim lost it? MIKE, his friend, is there in the Engineer's booth, with the Door's SECRETARY, Leticia, and an elegant MYSTERY WOMAN. They're smoking dope, partying.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MONTAGE collides into an ECU on JIM -- drinking as if to silence the images, the sounds we hear and see on his face. Spirits crying for release. In alcoholic solace. He passes out, head hitting the bar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jim's English friend, MIKE, walks in, throwing a harsh shaft of LA morning light across the dark bar and JIM's face, bleary eyed, passed out on the counter. He has a drinking paunch. With him are TOM BAKER, "TOM", the actor from the Warhol scene in New York and a huge biker type drinker named DOG, one of Jim's roadmen, a beard fanning his chest, tattoos everywhere. In the front of these three monoliths are about twenty beer bottles, numerous Jack Daniels bottles emptied and a lesbian BARTENDRESS pouring up a breakfast shot of bloody Marys... Mike hands Dog a breakfast in a brown paper bag.

Madness. COPS lining the edge of the stage, looking worried. As Jim throws his leather jacket into the cheering crowd and does the ghost dance around the microphone, Indian style, one foot, resurrecting the dead, the power of the circle. The stage is bottom lit, Dantean in look. The Doors casting giant shadows of heroic proportions. DEA AGENTS in suits and short hair take photos from the front of the stage, clipboards in hand. Blocked by a row of cops, it is impossible for Jim to communicate with his audience.

The others all look away embarrassed. This is certainly a moment the ordinary partner might turn away from Pamela, her tears running, but her pathacy, her inability to deal with pain is precisely what moves Jim the most -- a side of himself in her -- an ultimate weakness she has, he shares. As he goes to her, puts his arms gently around her.

Pause. He coughs horribly, the phlegm sucking out his chest with a horrid, asthmatic sound which he douses with another cigarette and another shot of whiskey. The Bushmills now two thirds empty. He looks over at the MYSTERY WOMAN now beside him at the microphone. MIKE and the SECRETARY watch.

	<DIALOGUE>
	A hot night in Miami January '69 -- every space in the auditorium is consumed... unfortunately the Doors have long since sold out. They've become an act. Morrison "falls" off the stage at least every other performance. "The Soft Parade" album only confirms the plasticity of their approach. Songs like "Touch Me" and "Follow Me Down" are not the Doors we once knew. So the question is: Why am I here? Are funerals entertainment?

INT. STAGE - SAME NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The DOORS come out finally. The noise is overwhelming. Acid, light, noise. Wagnerian Gods, Hitler...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JIM spreading his arms like Icarus set to fly. The ROARS redouble, their FEET stomping out:
</DIRECTION>
<CROWD>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	DOORS DOORS DOORS DOORS...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROWD>
<DIRECTION>
Joints are thrown by the dozen on the stage at Jim's feet. He is a god now as he bends regally, picks one up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COPS everywhere looking as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He lights it. The CROWD going nuts as the DOORS go into the ominous introductory strains of FIVE TO ONE trying to get the onus off Jim and the show on the road. The Audience knows the song, go into a primal FOOT STOMP with it. Bras are thrown on stage. Kids writhe madly in the primal Doors dance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
People with SPARKLERS running through the hangar. CAMERA FLASHBULBS popping throughout the show... get Jim on film while you can.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jim, drunk, high, smoking the jay, won't go into the lyrics right off, forcing the Doors to circle the beat again. He jerks his hand back from the mike as if it were a hot wire.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>

	ARE YOU REAAAAAAADYYYYYYYYY!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
The Crowd explodes once more. As a COP heads upstage to get Jim for the joint -- he cooly flicks it back into the crowd, avoiding disaster. Perfect timing as the Cop looks around, suddenly distracted by:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Crowd yelling something. An INSANE TEENAGER stands on the railing of a balcony above the auditorium, poised to swan dive some 18 feet into the crowd. Which he now does, arms held out like wings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Crowd yells, parting to allow his bulk to smack the floor. Pause. Cops rushing to the spot. The KID suddenly stands up, unhurt, with a stoned out look on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<TEENAGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TEENAGER>
<DIRECTION>
Then splits at a full run thru the crowd chased by the perplexed Cops. Everybody surging back towards the stage as JIM looses one of his primal SCREAMS.

During the instrumental break, Jim picks up one of the roses from the floor, pokes it at John on the drums, who whacks it to death on his skins. Jim starts to whirl the mike cord like a slingshot or bolo, in an ever-widening arc...

<DIRECTION>
...it flies off and smashes into the head of the PROMOTER at the edge of the stage arguing with SIDDONS. The man is staggered, weaving, Siddons helping him to a FIRST AID TEAM.

The crazy VEGETERIAN HIPPIE runs out on stage to give Jim the white lamb to make this political point. Jim holds the lamb in his arms. It's purring, gentle. DOG chases the HIPPIE off as he gives the microphone back to Jim and takes the lamb from him... he staggers over to ROBBIE and goes down to his knees, pretending to give him head on his frantic stoned guitar solo.

<DIRECTION>
PHOTOGRAPHERS flashing cameras. BAKER urging him on from the wings as he passes out. A GIRL runs onto the stage, dumps a bottle of champagne on Jim's head. Jim takes his shirt off, soaking wet. The CROWD is also stripping in the heat, shirts, blouses, screaming so much now they are obviously way past listening to any song. It has become a view of the future -- the NAKED GIRL and BOY dancing stark naked drugged out in the middle of it all, the FAT GIRL prowling naked on the edge of the stage before she's arrested, the FIGHTS in the Crowd, fists, blood, a black man chased and beaten, the sense of Altamont here, the hippie flower trip gone to shit -- it's all come down here tonight, the end of an era.

SPECIAL EFFECT -- the INDIAN GHOST is leaving Jim's body -- spectrally moving off him, hovering there in the air, its eyes -- the face of a dying Indian on an Arizona highway -- then gone. A moment, only three, four beats. An optical illusion? Maybe. Or is it saying, 'now you are just a white man'... maybe not. As it drifts off in a cloud, into the vast audience's EYEBALL.

The "Charges" are being read by the JUDGE, distant, not of this world. The court is lit in southern gothic daylight, ghostly chiaroscuro, all colors bled. Camera moving along the sweaty white faces of the six older JURORS, all of them straight "silent majority"... past the PROSECUTOR, his shadow cutting the jury box... onto JIM bearded, smoking 2 packs a day, a deep racking cough, sitting with his elder ATTORNEY... RAY, ROBBIE, JOHN, PAMELA, OTHERS in support are there in background. The trial is going down like a morphine dream, Jim featured in diopter close-up.

Jim cocks his head, listening to it playing from an inner room, his eyes on ROBIN opening the gift -- a beautiful, ANTIQUE DOLL of an 19th century poet -- rock star, stuffed, velour jacket, white fluffy lace collar, it could be Byron or it could be Jim Morrison -- in fact the hair is perfectly weaved to resemble Jim in his young lion phase -- an ironic gift, meant from the heart.

His eyes on a LITTLE BOY who's walking into the party, sitting down with the others, ignored, isolated, a birthday cap on his head. Clothes belong to the 1940's and the face seems familiar.

EXT. RAY'S HOUSE - VENICE - TWILIGHT

<DIRECTION>
The beach is behind them, the last of the frisbee players and dogs, the skaters go by, as we continue to hear RIDERS from within.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is Pam really there in Paris waiting?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<JIM>
<DIRECTION>
(ironic, head hurts)

</JIM>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never knew what you saw in that nightmare chick man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well she is kinda flakey -- like me. I mean she's just so vulnerable about everything. It makes me sad man.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But she's always kinda believed in something about me y'know -- her little picture of me as the unsung poet -- and it's a fantasy I kinda dig y'know, 'stead of the one I live.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know man, I don't wanna sound like your old man but you're only 27, you're living like you gotta get it all in, you gotta slow down man, you did it, you broke thru to the other side.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We didn't break thru Ray, we just pushed things a little. When you really break thru, there's nothing left. No music, no Doors, no God, nothing -- only a will to power.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't believe that. You were an American prince, man -- with overbred genes --

	No! What could've been Jim? You could've been President.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Jim cracks up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No man! What could've been Jim? We stood here on this beach on the edge of the Pacific that crazy summer day in '65 -- and we knew, you and I, we knew we were at the edge of the mind. we were there, man. One planet, one globe, one mind. Consciousness, we raised it, we were there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
Jim, not the sentimental type, climbs in his car, amused.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In that year we had a great Visitation of energy Back in those days Everything was simpler and more confused One summer night, going to the pier I ran into two young girls The blonde was called Freedom The dark one Enterprise We talked And they told me this story.

	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
His point of view -- Jim receding into the sun in his mustang -- making a shakey, screeching curve at the bend of the beach. And he's gone. An ominous ROAR of an AIRPLANE above RAY. -- flying away.

EXT. LOS ANGELES - TWILIGHT

The PLANE flies off into the setting ball of red sun.

<DIRECTION>
INT. RECORDING SESSION (LAST SESSION) - L.A. - DEC.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bearded POET hunches in his chair, exhausted, clutching the paper, finished. Pause. He downs a final shot, grunts to the Indian Ghostman sitting there on a stool watching him in the corner of the studio. The Ghostman laughs (but nothing comes out of his mouth). His wrinkled eyes are happy, feathered ponytail, he nods... pleased.
</DIRECTION>
<MORRISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, didja get all that?

</DIRECTION>
<ENGINEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I got it Jim.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENGINEER>
<DIRECTION>
The poets face brightens. A small but ever-so-sweet smile of triumph hikes up the corners of his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aw right. Let's get some tacos!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
He stands, sways, than moves out of view. The empty bottle of whiskey, its sands run out, is left behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As we FADE OUT, a hardy, mischievous Morrison laugh and a ripple of sensuous MUSIC carry us into the lilting, lamenting strains of AN AMERICAN PRAYER -- THE END without lyrics for now as we cut to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PARIS BEDROOM - NEAR DAWN (NIGHT) (1971)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAMELA is agitated in her sleep -- waking as she feels him watching. Is that him? At the door? A SHADOW -- leaves. Footsteps moving down the narrow Parisian corridor with the creaky floor.
</DIRECTION>
<PAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jim... that you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAM>
<DIRECTION>
Looks at the time. Somewhere near dawn. The sounds of a bath being drawn. Nightmare or sleep? She tries to fade back to sleep but the MUSIC and the WHISPERING prod her, pull her awake...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE: SAME FACE -- AN HOUR LATER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Putting her robe on, the slippers, the light... moving. She is much more ravaged looking than before.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATHROOM - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She finds him now... His face floating upwards, angelic eyes, the beard is now gone, a little smile on his face. He must be playing another joke. Although she really knows as she says the words:
</DIRECTION>
<PAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jim! It was you. I always know when it's you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jim Morrison, now you stop joking you hear me, cut it out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAM>
<DIRECTION>
His face. At peace, as she sobs, the MUSIC cresting to Jim's lyrics.
</DIRECTION>
<PAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...was it all right Jim, did you enjoy it when it came my baby? Just like you said it'd be?

	They are waiting to take us into the severed garden do you know how pale and wanton thrillful comes death at a strange hour? Unannounced unplanned for like a scaring overfriendly guest you've brought to bed? Death makes angels of us all? And gives us wings where we had shoulders smooth as raven's claws...

</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PERE LACHAISE CEMETERY - PARIS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His face etching into a perfect Alexandrine bust of physical beauty. The camera moving to reveal, a wintry day, leaves blowing, the wild cats everywhere in the empty cemetery, the crumbling tombs, the flowers fresh and dead around Jim's tomb, the graffiti, wine bottles, Wilde, Bizet, Piaf, Chopin, Morrison...
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>

	<DIALOGUE>
	No more money, no more fancy dress this other kingdom seems by far the best until its other jaw reveals incest and loose obedience to a vegetable law. I will not go I prefer a feast of friends to the giant family...

</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
The MUSIC rolling up on:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CORRIDOR & STAGE - LIMBO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smoke. Some lights. The distant cheers of a CROWD. In slightly SLOW MOTION, a FIGURE moves down a corridor into a blinding light of stage and smoke. THREE OTHER SHADOWS are there waiting -- as the GHOST moves to the microphone in altered motion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The AUDIENCE is out there somewhere in the dark -- we sense they too have become ghosts, as all of us will one day. The MUSIC continuing up to roll from AMERICAN PRAYER -- THE END -- snatches we annotate.
</DIRECTION>

	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM_THE_DOORS>
<DIRECTION>
Camera closing past the DOORS to JIM alone, circling the mike with his dance -- the INDIAN GHOSTMAN jigging, shaman- like, off to the side -- now levitating above the stage, all crazy, gawky dancing.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'll tell you a story of whiskey, mystics and men And about the believers and how the whole thing began First there were women and children obeying the moon Then daylight brought wisdom and sickness too soon... the moon is a dry blood beast We have assembled inside this ancient and insane theatre to propagate our lust for life and flee the swarming wisdom of the streets we live we die and death not ends it
