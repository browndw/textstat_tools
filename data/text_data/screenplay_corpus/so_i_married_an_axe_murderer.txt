:SC: MONTAGE OF VARIOUS SHOTS OF SAN FRANCISCO - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Over this we hear a recording of Jack Kerouac's poem, San Francisco which is accompanied by a BE-BOP trio. Kerouac's poetry coincides with the various shots of San Francisco. We come to a sign for Jack Kerouac Street. We PAN OVER to "THE CITY LIGHTS BOOKSTORE" and continue along to the ALLEYWAY where there is a large high-contrast black and white sign depicting Jack Kerouac in his famous "I'm looking into the distance, having a brilliant thought" pose...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHARLIE MACKENZIE, in his late twenties, wearing a flannel shirt and torn jeans, walks INTO THE FRAME, right in front of the picture of Jack Kerouac and inadvertently strikes the exact same pose. We PULL BACK to reveal that Charlie has a bag of garbage in his right hand, which he deposits in the alleyway. We FOLLOW Charlie into...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CITY LIGHTS BOOKSTORE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We FOLLOW him through the store. By day he is the Assistant Manager, by night he is a poet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MAN in his fifties, wearing a beret and a goatee is reading, Charles Bukowski's, Playing The Piano Like a Percussive Instrument, Until Your Fingers Begin To Bleed A Bit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie takes his place behind the cash register and resumes writing in his handsome leather-bound poetry journal.

CUSTOMER approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<CUSTOMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you have the book On The Road by Jack Kerouac?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CUSTOMER>
<DIRECTION>
Every day there is a steady stream of tourists who come in to get copies of On The Road. Charlie is use to this and without looking up he points to a huge, well marked display of thousands of copies of On The Road. Another TOURIST COUPLE approach.
</DIRECTION>
<TOURIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you have a copy of On The Road by Jack Kerouac?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOURIST>
<DIRECTION>
Again not looking up, Charlie just points.

EXT. CITY LIGHTS BOOKSTORE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie puts the "CLOSED" sign on the door and proceeds to walk home.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREETS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sights and the sounds of the city are accentuated by the BEBOP as he sees life, warts and all. As the streets become less populated, he can now hear the sounds of his own FOOTSTEPS and, a COUPLE BICKERING. The streets become even more deserted. The night is closing in on him. A cat darts out from an alleyway and startles him. He quickens his pace. RUMBLINGS make him cross the street to avoid the danger. Headlights of a slow moving car approach from the distance. Charlie, frightened, turns another corner onto:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He approaches a 3-story Victorian home, in which he has an apartment on the second floor, he notices a light on in his window. A CRASHING sound from within.

CHARLIE

pushing open his apartment door in a mock SWAT maneuver, then stealthily stalking toward the sound of the intruder in the bedroom. He stubs his toe on a spring loaded doorstop making a loud metal VITTSWINGGGG's sound. He freezes, terrified.

</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sherri! What are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<SHERRI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm leaving you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERRI>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, thank God... I thought you were robbing our own home, because frankly, that's insane. I mean, what could you possibly gain by robbing your own home? I don't mean to meddle, but isn't it better to rob other peoples' homes? Start accumulating their wealth as opposed to just reaccumulating your own wealth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<SHERRI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not funny, Charlie. I'm really leaving.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERRI>
<DIRECTION>
She continues to pack. Charlie tries to unpack her things.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?! Just because we had a fight last night?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<SHERRI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've had a fight every night for two months. Ever since I brought up the subject of marriage, you've found fault with everything I do. Why couldn't we have gotten married, Charlie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERRI>
<CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm too young to get married.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(begins putting her things back)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm only twenty-nine and a half. We love living together.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<SHERRI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's been two years now. I need something more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERRI>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See, Sherri, this is frustrating for me, okay. When we first started going out I thought we agreed that we weren't the sort of people who got married.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<SHERRI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's like saying we're not the sort of people who are going to grow old. We're not going to fall into that "growing old" trap. Face it, you've got a problem with commitment, Charlie. Take a look at your other girlfriends. Every time you get close to a commitment there's something wrong with them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERRI>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, I broke up with them for good reasons.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<SHERRI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about Sandy?

</SHERRI>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sandy was an alcoholic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<SHERRI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No-no-no. You thought she was an alcoholic. She just drank more than you drank. What about Jill?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERRI>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She hated my family.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<SHERRI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You thought she hated your family. Nobody hates your family. Everybody loves your family. What about Julie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERRI>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She smelled like soup.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<SHERRI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What does that mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERRI>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She smelled exactly like Campbell's Beef Vegetable soup. She was dirty, physically dirty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<SHERRI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Charlie, I wonder what you're gonna say were my problems? Are you gonna tell your friends that I was a junkie, that I wasn't supportive enough or that I smelled like relish? Charlie, I loved you. It could have worked out.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she goes to the door)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Think about it.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.

</TONY>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I say to myself, 'I've finally found somebody that I'm truly comfortable with.' You know when you're so comfortable that you'll let them put makeup on you to see what you would look like if you were a girl. Anyways you know what I do in the dream next?

	</DIALOGUE>
</TONY>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, but, I'm afraid, okay? There are seven main rites of passage in a man's life. Birth, first day of school, last day of school. Marriage. Kids. Retirement. Death. I'm at marriage. I'm two rites of passage away from death.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<TONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONY>

Tony is doing three-sixties, scoping out beauties, when suddenly his roving eyes lock on a police car directly behind them. He slouches down into his seat.
</DIRECTION>
<TONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Christ. It's the cops.

</TONY>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>

</TONY>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, I'm sorry, man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<TONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, it's funny I don't even feel related to my parents anymore. I feel like your mom and dad are more like my parents. I feel more Scottish than Italian.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONY>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tony Spiletti, I don't think you could get more Italian than that. Unless of course your name was Tony Italian Guy.

Charlie checks out the girls in the coffee bar.

	Waitress, I'm sorry, there seems to be a mistake. I ordered the large cappuccino.

Tony grabs him and pulls him aside.
</DIRECTION>
<TONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You really don't understand, do you? When a girl comes over to your table and says, 'I think you're funny.' It means you've pretty much been given the keys to the city. Charlie, this is big.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONY>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps you've confused me with someone who gives a shit. Here's what's gonna happen, Tony. We'll end up going out with them tonight, maybe even home with them. Well go out for two months. Soon she'll move in, we'll be happy, She'll want more of a commitment. I'll be terrified and I'll do something to ruin it. Just like I did with Sherri.
	</DIALOGUE>

	Dad, what are you doing to Tony now? Why do you abuse his mind like this?

Next to them is a German couple, speaking German, looking through a coin-operated binocular. He says something which causes her to cry.

(to his confused look)
</DIRECTION>

</HARRIET>
<CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(walking into living room)

Harriet starts laughing. Then so does Charlie. They lean into each other. Pretty close. Too close even, and when it seems like they're going to kiss, Charlie suddenly gets uncomfortable and looks at his watch.

<CHARLIE>

	Look, the truth is, yes, I had a great time, and I'd like to kiss you, but if we do kiss, then we'll kiss on the couch and if we kiss on the couch, then we'll kiss in the bedroom, and once you're in the bedroom -- Well, the thing is, I always rush it. And this time I feel like maybe I should wait. Maybe we should let it build naturally and grow, instead of just immediately spending the night together.

Through the steam we can just make out Harriet in the shower washing her hair. Charlie walks over.

ALCATRAZ
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We open on the LOUD BANGING of a CELL DOOR. We find our tour group in the holding area. The PARK RANGER is a beefy man in his late fifties and talks with emotionless, military precision.
</DIRECTION>
<PARK_RANGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, everyone I'm a park ranger and I will be leading you on the tour. All the park rangers here at Alcatraz were at one time guards, myself included. My name is John Johnson, but everyone here calls me Vicki. Will you please follow me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARK_RANGER>
<DIRECTION>
They are led out. We see that Alcatraz is a sinister place. Cold and unforgiving. The Park Ranger leads them to the center of a cell block.
</DIRECTION>
<TONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're glowing, Charlie. The man's in love.

<PARK_RANGER>

	Sssh I don't want to talk about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<TONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With that look, you don't have to talk about it. The grin alone could get you five to seven years.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONY>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tony, get your mind out of the gutter. All you need to know is that she's a sweet, kind and loving person.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<PARK_RANGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now this is something none of the other tour guides will tell you. In this particular cell block Machine Gunn Kelly had, what we call in the prison system, a "bitch." And one day, in a jealous rage, Kelly took a makeshift knife, or "shiv," and cut out his "bitch's" eyes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARK_RANGER>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, what can I tell you. I'm smitten. I'm in deep smit. I dunno. I just don't wanna talk about it, because then I start analyzing and that's not good for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<TONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. I think that's good. Just let it happen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONY>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exactly. That's what's gonna be different this time. Something strange happens, let it go. It's not my business... Like Ralph. She says Ralph in her sleep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<TONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's Ralph?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONY>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know who Ralph is. Moreover, I don't want to know.

</CHARLIE>
<TONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONY>
<PARK_RANGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And as if blinding his "bitch" wasn't enough retribution for Kelly, the next day he and four other inmates took turns pissing into the "bitch's" ocular cavity.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARK_RANGER>

Tony and Charlie look at each other. They're a little queasy.

</CHARLIE>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	About her past.

	Here's the thing. I may have to tell Harriet.

	I hope I'm not interrupting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRIET>
<CHARLIE>

Harriet hugs Rose and then stands right next to her.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, don't you think we look alike?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRIET>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, we do not. Harriet was always prettier than me. And a heck of a lot more popular. She always had boyfriends. The only thing I ever got was good grades.

	Good grades are good.

<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Harriet. I don't want to. They're not good.

	You're so modest. If I weren't here to brag for you, I just don't know...

cabinet)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Show it to him, Rose. Do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRIET>
<DIRECTION>
He turns it over and there is a picture there. A collage of unrelated images put together. And it is beautiful.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But it's very abstract. Violent perhaps. Confused definitely. He likes it.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's beautiful...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks.

</ROSE>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you call it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I dunno.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A lot artists don't like to title their work. They feel it biases the viewer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is titled. It's called "I dunno".
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie looks at it again, then at Rose, then at Harriet. It's all a little bizarre, but in a funny way he feels for Rose. A hidden talented overshadowed by her sister's beauty.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We should get going, Charlie. Thanks, Rose... See you later.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRIET>

The arcade man turns around to watch. Harriet winds up and throws the bean bag directly into his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<ARCADE_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCADE_MAN>
<HARRIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry... I told you Charlie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRIET>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no, you're okay, you're just having control problems.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
They both start laughing. He puts his arm around her. In the b.g. the wounded arcade man is being led away by a co-worker.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They continued down the boardwalk stand in front of a House of Horrors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It looks somewhat run down and Harriet looks questioningly at Charlie.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know this is really, really cheesy, but in a way this is one of the places in San Francisco I'm most proud of.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<HARRIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, let's go in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRIET>
<DIRECTION>
Tony nods agreement. Susan looks bored. They go inside the
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HOUSE OF HORRORS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
it's as low rent as Charlie described. The "KEEPER OF THE THRESHOLD" so described in a poorly written sign, is an overweight man in his late twenties, wearing jeans and a denim jacket and a little bit of scary makeup. He looks like a roadie for the band, KISS. He stands at a podium, smoking and reading a paper. As Charlie, Tony, Harriet and Susan pass the Threshold Keeper, he takes a casual drag of his cigarette, lets out a little smoke and with zero commitment utters:
</DIRECTION>
<THRESHOLD_KEEPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boo.

INT. WAX MUSEUM - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Harriet and Charlie enter Bill's Wax Museum. The OWNER of the wax museum greets them.
</DIRECTION>
<OWNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi. I'm Bill, welcome to my wax museum.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OWNER>
<DIRECTION>
They walk over to the exhibits. There are exhibits of Abraham Lincoln, Michael Jackson and Dolly Parton. As they look more closely they notice that the faces are exactly the same as Bill's. They laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pouring rain. THUNDER. Charlie and Harriet, wrapped in each others arms, walking through the rain.

INT. CHARLIE'S PARENT'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We again move along the hallway. We pass the Scottish wall, of fame, Scottie from "Star Trek", Sir Walter Scott, Sir Harry Lauder, Sheena Easton, Al Pacino, Billy Connolly, then the CAMERA BACKTRACKS to Pacino, where it HOLDS MOMENTARILY.

	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<STUART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, that's for Tony. So, Charlie tells me you're a butcher. Let's talk meat.

Stuart gets him in a half-Nelson.

</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie struggles to free himself. Stuart turns to greet Harriet. As he reaches out his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Totally instinctively, Harriet grabs Stuart's hand and twists it behind his back. Charlie is startled, as his date has just gotten Stuart into a Half-Nelson.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRIET>

<HARRIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm really embarrassed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRIET>
<STUART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be embarrassed about having a good strong butcher's grip. Do you link your own sausage?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine. Don't worry about it. Hurry.

They smile as he leaves the room.
</DIRECTION>
<STUART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Make sure there's paper, Charlie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STUART>

Charlie picks up the pace, scared of what he might hear next.

INT. BATHROOM AT PARENTS' - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He closes the door, and shakes his head. What can he do? Those are his parents. On the wall opposite the toilet is a well-used dart board with pictures of the Queen Mother and Colonel Sanders. Hooked to the magazine caddie is a small container of darts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
May excitedly shows Harriet family photo albums.
</DIRECTION>
<MAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is Charlie with his Uncle Ecky. He's a policeman in Canada. And our cousins Ruth and Jack. He's just got a restraining order from his wife. She's a lovely girl. This is Billy. He's a member of parliament. He drinks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAY>
<HARRIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What a nice family you have.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRIET>
<DIRECTION>
CHARLIE IN THE BATHROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He doesn't seem in any hurry to leave either. He listens through the door to Harriet enthusiastically looking through old photos.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie glances down at a stack of National Enquirers on the magazine rack. He flips through a few.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sees one of the absurd headlines: "ALIEN UFO SEX DIET" Charlie shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRIET>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) (through door)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Charlie was the cutest baby.

</HARRIET>
<STUART>

</STUART>
<CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(through door)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie then looks down at another article in the Enquirer and reads:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"WHO'S NEXT FOR MRS. X - THE HONEYMOON KILLER?"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is the article about Mrs. X -- the axe-murderer who kills her husbands on their honeymoons and then marries again under a different identity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE LIVING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
May is quickly flipping through a photo album, pointing out pictures of relatives as she goes:
</DIRECTION>
<HARRIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't believe the resemblance between you and Charlie, Mrs. MacKenzie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRIET>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHARLIE IN THE BATHROOM

With Harriet speaking in the b.g., Charlie continues reading, now absorbed in the article about the 3 victims:

INT. CHARLIE'S CAR - NIGHT - C.U. - HARRIET'S FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sitting in the front seat of Charlie's car, smiling, content, a great meal, a great night out with Charlie and a nice evening with his parents.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly PAN across the front seat to Charlie. A nervous anxious "what the hell am I getting myself into" look on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, that was some move you put on my Dad, there. Did you study Karate, or...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<HARRIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Not officially. I dated a guy for a while who ran a studio.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRIET>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, the martial arts expert. The north-south guy. Here in San Francisco?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<HARRIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, Miami.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRIET>
<DIRECTION>
He looks straight ahead, trying to act unfazed. But, he's very phased -- his expression is covered in it.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was that before Atlantic City, or after?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<HARRIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, that was years ago. Atlantic City was recent. I didn't care for Atlantic City. A town full of gamblers and lounge singers.

He keeps driving.

INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

	Tony, do you mind my saying that you seem a little down?

</CAPTAIN>
<TONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Captain. It's about my work. About being a policeman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONY>
<CAPTAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tony, if there's anything wrong, I'm here to listen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN>
<TONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. And that's what's irritating, you're too nice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONY>
<CAPTAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too nice!?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN>
<TONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, You're my captain for gods sakes. You should be constantly on my case, like the captain on Starsky and Hutch. Once a week you should routinely haul my ass into your office, accuse me of being a maverick and complain to me that you're sick and tired of defending my screwball antics to the commissioner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONY>
<CAPTAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, as you may know, Tony. I don't report to a commissioner. I report to a committee, some of whom are appointed, some elected and the remainder co-opted on a bi-annual basis. A quorum --
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN>
<TONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Police work should be all about running around, following up crazy hunches that turn out to be right, going out on a limb.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONY>
<CAPTAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well Tony, I've never seen it that way. For me police work is all about following procedure and remaining accountable to the general public.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN>
<TONY>
<DIRECTION>
(exasperated)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Captain! When I joined the police force, I thought I was going to be Serpico and unfortunately I ended up being Toma. I would have settled for Beretta.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONY>
<CAPTAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's interesting Tony. I'm perturbed that you should be so disillusioned.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie enters.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Tony, I gotta talk to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<CAPTAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, hello, Charlie. Look, I'm in the way here. You guys probably have something you want to talk about, and Tony, if you've still got stuff you want to sort out, please, you know where the suggestion box is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN>
<DIRECTION>
The Captain exits.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice guy. Hey, what's up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<TONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm having doubts about being a cop again. It's not like how it is on cop shows. All I do is fill out papers and reports.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONY>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me get this straight, your Captain hasn't threatened to have you up on charges so fast you won't know what hit you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<TONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! He's never once said to me that he was going to "throw the book at me so hard it'll knock my ass from here till Tuesday." Anyways what's up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONY>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie pulls out the National Enquirer (the one on MRS. X, the Honeymoon Killer).

	Have you heard of this case? Mrs. X? She murders her husbands on their honeymoons and then changes her identity and marries again.

<TONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never heard of it. So what?

	Everything's adding up, Tony. One of the victims was a martial arts expert. Last night at dinner, she put a martial arts move on my dad.
	</DIALOGUE>

	There about twenty thousand people in San Francisco who are martial arts experts. Should I arrest all of them too?

</CHARLIE>
<TONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're just getting scared. Like the dream, you feel Harriet could be the one, so you start to suspect her of things, 'cause deep down you're scared that if she is the one, you'll marry, and marriage to you is death.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONY>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, don't analyze my dreams, okay? They're my dreams. Analyze your own dreams.
	</DIALOGUE>

Charlie and Tony are in the back with KATHY, a stocky black woman in uniform, who works in the files department.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHY>

	There's no record of any deaths. All three of these guys were reported missing around the time of their honeymoon, but so were the wives. No pictures of any of the brides. For all we know they just picked up and moved away.

</KATHY>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And Ralph Elliot, too?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>

	Charlie, you're talking about three guys over a seven year span. That's hardly news. No deaths. Elopement in this state, as of this day, is still not illegal.

</TONY>
<CHARLIE>

	Yeah well murder is. And this article says that these men were murdered by the same woman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<KATHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. MacKenzie, we've found that, most National Enquirer articles are actually based on our own police reports. They take the facts and fabricate a story around them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHY>
<TONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's true, Charlie. You gotta realize that. I mean, personally, I would lie to you, but Kathy... has this crazy notion of always telling the truth.

	<DIALOGUE>
	You feel better now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONY>

	Inside? I was hoping...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
(letting him in)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm glad you asked. I didn't want to be so forward. I mean, if you're waiting inside, then you feel obligated to entertain me and keep up the conversation just to be polite, and really your head might be totally elsewhere and then there's the chance that you would really want to talk and it's me who'd be busy, but in an attempt not to be rude, I sit there and listen to some story that you don't really want to tell and I don't really have time to hear. You know?

	I dunno, Tony, I just...

<TONY>

	Besides, everyone has something going on with them. I mean, you can't find everything in one person. I mean, she's bright, she's funny, she's independent. So maybe, and it's really just a maybe, she kills her husbands. Marriage is give and take, Man. You take the good with the bad.

Tony hangs up. Charlie stops pedaling on the bike. Now he really feels like shit. Harriet's not a killer. Sherri's not a cheater.

Moments later he appears, puts on a pair of pants over his exercise shorts, then races out the door again.

Once again, baffled by Rose, Charlie touches his hair, shakes it off and looks Harriet right in the eye.

INT. HARRIET'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harriet is doing a load of laundry consisting of bloodied work clothes. Suddenly she can hear the sound of MUSIC, very loudly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Annoyed, she goes out her front door to tell her neighbors off. Just as she's about to knock on the door, she realizes it's not the source of the music. At that moment her neighbor, who is a STEWARDESS, comes out in nightclothes.
</DIRECTION>
<STEWARDESS>

INT. BATHTUB - HARRIET'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Romantic with candles surrounding the tub. Harriet and Charlie are bathing together. Wherever one of them moves, the water extinguishes a candle and Charlie lights it. This is keeping him pretty busy.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been there for almost a year. I only planned on stay with her for a few weeks, but she gets upset every time I say I'm moving.

<HARRIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He hated it. Trudging off to those weddings every Saturday night. Other people's celebrations he called it. He said sometimes they didn't even offer him a glass of soda. He had a small studio, and every year at Christmas he'd take a picture of me and Rose and put it in the window on a little card that said "Seasons Greetings." Awful pictures. It's like... I could see his pain in my face. Anyway, me and my sister worked with our "childhood issues" in different ways. She became a photographer and I became phobic about having my picture taken. It's quite a family.

Then we come to William, who's reluctantly at the children's table. All his little cousins are queuing up for a chance to feel his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We find Charlie in a corner. One of the hooting Scottish aunties is trying to get him to have another Scotch.
</DIRECTION>
<AUNTIE_MOLLY>

</TONY>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. Oh, there she is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
She's in the corner by herself looking weird and ominous. She has enough food in front or her for three people.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She eats ravenously and incessantly. Charlie goes over to her.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A little hungry, were you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
At that moment, a FLASH goes off. Harriet looks up angrily.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRIET>
<DIRECTION>
Then she realizes it's Rose. She calms down and smiles. Charlie looks at her, a little peculiarly, but Harriet regains her composure.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry. The flash just...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRIET>
<DIRECTION>
The band kicks into a new dance. A YOUNG BOY comes up to the bagpipe man with a shot of whiskey and whispers into his ear. The bagpipe man stops the song, downs the whiskey and then breaks into Rod Stewart's "IF YOU THINK I'M SEXY." From across the room we hear Stuart singing.
</DIRECTION>
<STUART>
<DIRECTION>
(full volume; singing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	IF YOU THINK I'M SEXY... AND YOU WANT MY BODY... COME ON BABY LET ME KNOW.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STUART>
<DIRECTION>
Stuart gives the Bagpiper the thumbs up. The young people in the room start to jam, and then one by one the other guests start getting into the swing of things. The bagpipe man continues playing. It is clear that he is far too drunk to play. He slowly keels over, drunk. And as he falls over face first, he lands on his Bagpipes. The bagpipes let out an ATONAL DEFLATING SOUND like the last dying throes of a tortured animal. The BAGPIPE WAIL extends into the next scene.

As they deal with the luggage, Harriet starts to walk away from the hotel, away from the car, rain falling on her head. She walks straight at the CAMERA, so only we can see her expression. Her expression is one of simply "losing it".

INT. BEAUTIFUL FRENCH RESTAURANT IN HOTEL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beautiful dining room with a small dance floor. Charlie sits at an intimate table for two with Harriet. A small band plays in the b.g., as the BAND LEADER is making the toast. The five or six other couples in the restaurant also hold up their glass.
</DIRECTION>
<BAND_LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...we're honored to be here for this very special day in...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAND_LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
The CONCIERGE at this point interrupts to bring Charlie a TELEPHONE. Everyone stops and watches and waits.
</DIRECTION>
<CONCIERGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry to interrupt, Sir. There's a phone call for you from town.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Charlie takes phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They say it's quite urgent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONCIERGE>
<DIRECTION>
The toast, as well as the entire room, stops -- almost like an E.F. Hutton commercial, waiting for Charlie's phone call to finish.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(curious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello?

INT. AIRPORT IN OREGON - EARLY EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tony speaks into the phone frantically.
</DIRECTION>
<TONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Charlie, you okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONY>
<DIRECTION>
INTERCUT PHONE CALL
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great. Couldn't be better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<TONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Charlie, listen to me! It's her! Harriet is Mrs. X! She killed Ralph and the two other men!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONY>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie looks up across the table at Harriet who is completely caught up in the event of seeing how long she can keep her hand in the candle before it hurts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She puts it in, smiles then takes it out. She shakes her hand, and repeats the process.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(talking softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, that's great -- it just so happens though, that I met...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(louder than he had hoped)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ralph, and much to my delight, not only is she alive, but she's female. I thought I told you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Harriet looks at Charlie, very suspiciously. He looks back at her, and tries to smile, pretending that he is having a pleasant, and completely irrelevant conversation.
</DIRECTION>
<TONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rose had a picture. It checked out. It's her, Charlie. She is the murderer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONY>
<HARRIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Charlie, your food is getting cold.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRIET>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie waves "One Minute" to Harriet, as she watches.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, what do I do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<TONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I called the police. All the roads are closed, but they're on their way. In the mean time just...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONY>
<DIRECTION>
The line goes DEAD.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello?

</CHARLIE>
<HARRIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's a matter, Charlie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRIET>
<CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(to concierge)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The phone just went dead. I was on the phone and it went dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<CONCIERGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's quite common, sir. I'm sure the lines'll be out in the whole city 'til tomorrow. Enjoy your meal, Sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONCIERGE>
<DIRECTION>
The Concierge takes the phone away. Charlie turns slowly to Harriet, genuinely scared.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened, Charlie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRIET>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing... Nothing happened. Just the lines are down. Phone lines.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the band leader continues with his toast.
</DIRECTION>
<BAND_LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
(over microphone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...so to these two young people, we wish them a long and happy life together and would like to play their song. The Platters -- "Only You".
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAND_LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
The band starts to play "Only You".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
People APPLAUD. Harriet and Charlie just stare at each other. He knows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The older couple at the next table, MR. & MRS. LEVENSTEIN, lean over to their table.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_LEVENSTEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about the traditional Bride & Groom dance?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_LEVENSTEIN>
<DIRECTION>
Another couple walks by and pulls them literally out of the their seats and onto the dance floor.
</DIRECTION>
<OTHER_COUPLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on. It's a tradition.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHER_COUPLE>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie finds himself in the middle of the dance floor dancing slowly with Harriet. He's scared out of his mind. The music plays in the background. Harriet smiles strangely at him. He tries to smile back, checking all the Exits, planning an escape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then suddenly, call it luckily, MR. LEVENSTEIN, interrupts:
</DIRECTION>
<MR_LEVENSTEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me. Could I cut in on your dance?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_LEVENSTEIN>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course. Sure...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie gives her hand away to Mr. Levenstein. He takes Mrs. Levenstein's hand and starts to dance towards the EXIT, when suddenly the ELECTRICITY GOES OUT. The MUSIC is out. The LIGHTS ARE OUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the dimmest of lights provided from the cloud covered moon outside, Charlie runs across the dance floor, fighting for an exit to the outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He arrives in someone's arms on his way.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need your help! You have to help me! I've married a...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
The LIGHTS GO BACK ON and Charlie is in HARRIET'S ARMS again. Her face is near menacing now. She smiles a very disturbed grin. He doesn't know what to say.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRIET>
<DIRECTION>
(much too pleasant)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Charlie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRIET>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie and her are squared off. Neither speak. Suddenly both of them are lifted into the air. They look down and see the waiters and busboys picking them up onto chairs, throwing them up in the air again and again. The MUSIC plays along loudly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harriet watches Charlie very closely, as Charlie looks scared. Then, the people start to carry them out of the room and down the hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<WAITER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's take 'em to their room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAITER>
<CONCIERGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I'm sure they've had enough of these crowds for one night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONCIERGE>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My dinner. I didn't finish my dinner yet.

INT. CHARLIE & HARRIET'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The other hotel guests threw them inside. The room is all made up, the sheets are pulled down, the firewood is cut, the AXE is in the wood.
</DIRECTION>
<CONCIERGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have a good night, you two.
	</DIALOGUE>

Harriet pulls Charlie back into the room, frightened that he's leaving.

	Don't go, Charlie.

</HARRIET>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. AIRPORT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tony runs out of the airport terminal where he sees a man in his forties who's just entered his four wheel drive jeep.
</DIRECTION>
<TONY>
<DIRECTION>
(flashing his badge)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me, Sir, I'm with the San Francisco Police Department. I'm on official business and I'm afraid I have to commandeer your vehicle.

</TONY>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I happen to know for a fact that you don't have the power to commandeer my vehicle.

</MAN>
<TONY>

	This is true.

INT. CHARLES AND HARRIET'S ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie & Harriet are all alone. The voices trail off down the hallway until they disappear. Charlie and Harriet stare at each other. Harriet blocks the door. Charlie looks around the room. The Axe. The Corkscrew. The letter opener. The fountain pen. At this point, everything in the room looks like a potential weapon. Harriet takes the axe.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I heard you on the phone before, Charlie. There's something I've got to tell you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRIET>
<CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(frightened)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harriet, I...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<HARRIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been married before.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRIET>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I already know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<HARRIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	About my husbands?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRIET>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. And I was meaning to have a word with you. We could get an annulment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<HARRIET>
<DIRECTION>
(screams)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	AAAhhhhhhh!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRIET>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the power goes off again. They're both in the dark. A scuffle. Charlie has restrained Harriet, throws her in a walk-in closet and locks it. From behind the door, we hear Harriet WAILING. Which continues.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie picks up the axe, looks at it, relieved at his lucky escape. He rushes to the door to escape. He opens it and standing there is Rose.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aaaaah, Rose, I never thought I'd be so glad to see you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Rose smiles. Charlie puts down the axe. The lights flicker back on.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(going to the phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe the phones are working again by now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
He listens for a dial tone. Beside the phone he sees a note. He starts to read is:
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Dear, Harriet. I just can't handle the commitment. I'm leaving you.' Signed, 'Charlie.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
And behind him Rose approaches with the axe raised.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell is this? I didn't write this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
And at that moment he turns to find the AXE BEING FLUNG THROUGH THE AIR AT his head. He ducks just in time.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the fuck?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
She takes another swing and she hits the lamp off the desk and the room is in complete DARKNESS.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Charlie. Why did you marry Harriet? I warned you not to marry her, didn't I? I warned all of them. But none of them listened to me. They all went ahead and married her. She's the pretty one. Where's Harriet? What have you done with my sister, Harriet?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing, Rose.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you've done something to my sister, Harriet, I swear to God I'll kill you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
We stay in Charlie's hip pocket as he tries to get away from what he can't see. He stays very silent.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRIET>
<DIRECTION>
(from the closet)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are you, Charlie? What's going on?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRIET>
<DIRECTION>
Then Rose strikes a match. She lights a candle and comes toward him. He looks around. The window is open. And Charlie is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COMMANDEERED CAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tony and the commandeered man drive through the swampy, winding road on the way up to the hotel. Tony is drumming on the dash.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could you stop doing that please?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CASTLE-LIKE ROUND TOWER/LEDGE OF TOWER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie tightropes along the ledge of the building. The storm continues. Rose comes out on the ledge and starts to chase him. He rounds the bend. Charlie looks into one room and sees MR. & MRS. LEVENSTEIN there. There's loud OPERA MUSIC playing in the room
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Call the police!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE LEVENSTEIN'S ROOM - NIGHT SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Levensteins prepare for bed. Charlie races by their window. Then Rose races by.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Call the police!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Levenstein closes the curtains. He can't hear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LEDGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie races along the slippery ledge, almost falling at several points. Rose then appears on the roof holding the Axe, still.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
(mostly to herself; slurring most words)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Charlie, did you like your note? I thought it was pretty accurate. I did all the husbands' notes. I can forge anyone's handwriting, I can write in anyone's style. See, I'm an artist. Harriet isn't an artist. Sure she could get a husband, but she could never have done this. And you know what I'm most proud of?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that, Rose?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harriet never knew. She thought they all just left her. I protected her. She's my sister.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie turns and runs. Rose chases him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tony breaks into the room with his gun drawn.
</DIRECTION>
<TONY>
<DIRECTION>
(shouting)
</DIRECTION>

</TONY>
<HARRIET>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tony, is that you? It's me, Harriet. I'm in here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRIET>
<DIRECTION>
Carefully, Tony opens the closet door.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tony, Rose is trying to kill Charlie. They're out on the ledge.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRIET>
<TONY>
<DIRECTION>
(not believing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get on the floor and put your hands behind your back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONY>
<DIRECTION>
Harriet willingly goes on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, anything. You've got to save Charlie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRIET>
<DIRECTION>
Tony slaps cuffs on her and takes her to the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tony is standing with his back to the window, between it and Harriet. She looks out of the window and screams.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look! It's Charlie!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRIET>
<DIRECTION>
From Harriet's POV we see Charlie on the ledge edging along. He stops in horror when he sees Harriet, glances back to the pursuing Rose, and rushes off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tony looks behind him out the window. Nobody is there.
</DIRECTION>
<TONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice try.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONY>
<HARRIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I swear to you... It was Charlie... Look! Now there's Rose!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRIET>
<DIRECTION>
Rose looks into the room, with the axe in her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<TONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No you don't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONY>
<HARRIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I beg you... Look! It is Rose.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRIET>
<TONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh no, not again.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he glances at the window)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aaaaah! Rose.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LEVENSTEIN'S WINDOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is opera music playing. Charlie rushes by, past the window. There is a beat and he comes back, staring inside in amazement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Levenstein is in a Viking outfit. Mrs. Levenstein is in full Norse Regalia.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LEVENSTEIN'S WINDOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie gulps and rushes on, hastily pursued by Rose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE ROOF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rose pulls the Axe back and swings, and the momentum of the swing pulls her feet out from under her, and on the slippery icy roof she falls and starts to slide.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just as she's about to go off the fifty foot high roof, Charlie climbs down the roof. He stands over her. She's about to slip. Her hands are losing strength. Her fingers are slipping. The rain is falling harder and harder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie walks over to the cage where she's hanging on for life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He leans down to help her up, but just as he grabs on to her hand, the drainpipe she's holding onto slips.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is now dangling from the roof, the rain falling harder and harder. Charlie now is nowhere near her. He then gets down on his knees on the roof and starts to climb down the side of the drainpipe to get her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rose looks up helplessly at him. Not really asking for his help. Not denying it. She's accepted her fate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Policemen, ambulances and spectators have gathered below in bunches as Charlie climbs down the drainpipe, he himself hanging on for dear life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He just reaches out far enough to grab her hand, and just as he does, her drainpipe tears and falls into the crowd below. Charlie, then with all his strength -- his "where has this strength been my whole life" strength -- pulls her up to the roof next to him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Several policemen make their way onto the roof and come over to where Charlie is detaining Rose. The police take her, handcuff her and cart her away. From the corner of the roof appears Tony.
</DIRECTION>
<TONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hate to bother you on your honeymoon, Charlie, but...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONY>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie looks beyond Tony and sees Harriet standing in the doorway. He goes over and puts his arm around Harriet.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank God. I'm sorry I doubted you, but I thought you were the killer, but you were acting pretty strange?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<HARRIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you were going to leave me, like the others. Thank God they were just murdered. I thought they were always leaving me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRIET>
<DIRECTION>
Below, Rose is put into a police car and taken off. The SIRENS disappear. So do the crowds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE INTO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SOUND OF A CROWD IN A CLUB:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SPILETTI'S COFFEE HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie is on stage looking very beatnik. He's reading his poetry, but we can't hear it. He nods to someone off stage. Harriet is in the audience, also looking very beatnik with their three year old son, STUART, a miniature beatnik version of Charlie.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)

	<DIALOGUE>
	My dad was right. You don't lose your muse once you're married. Nothing changed, except I gained a great son, Stuart.
