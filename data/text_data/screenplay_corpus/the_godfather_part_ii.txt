standing impassively, like a young Prince, recently crowned King.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE VIEW ON Michael's hand. ROCCO LAMPONE kisses his hand. Then it is taken away. We can SEE only the empty desk and chair of Michael's father, Vito Corleone. We HEAR, over this, very faintly a funeral dirge played in the distance, as THE VIEW MOVES SLOWLY CLOSER to the empty desk and chair.

EXT. A SICILIAN LANDSCAPE - FULL VIEW - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We can barely make out the funeral procession passing over the burnt-brown of a dry river bed. The figures move slowly, seemingly from out of hundreds of years of the past.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MUSICIANS walking unsteadily on the rocky bed, their instruments harsh and blaring.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are followed by six young peasant men, carrying the crude wooden coffin on their shoulders. Then the widow, a strong large woman, dressed in black, and not accepting the arms of those walking with her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind her, not more than twenty relatives, few children and paisani continue alone behind the coffin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, we HEAR the shots of the lupara, and the musicians stop their playing. The entire procession scatters in odd directions along the rocky river bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The young men struggle with the burden of the heavy coffin, throwing it out of balance and nearly crashing to the ground. We hear a woman SCREAMING:

across the slain body of a fourteen year old boy, lying on the parched ground. In the distance we see four or five of the mourning women, the wind blowing their black dresses and veils, running up to the body of the boy. They begin to wail, and cry out in anguished Sicilian, as the widow, the mother of the murdered boy, holds her child in her arms, his fresh blood wetting her strong hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BARONIAL ESTATE - TIGHT MOVING VIEW - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A boy, eight or nine, with wide, frightened eyes, being pulled quickly by the hand. This is VITO ANDOLINI, who is to become The Godfather.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The VIEW ALTERS revealing that he is being pulled along by his Mother, the Widow, across a field leading to the ornamental gates of a Baronial Estate of some forgotten Noble.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At various positions near the gates are men with shotguns, or lupara. The gates are opened; and the Widow and her boy are shown before DON FRANCESCO, a man in his sixties. He wears his trousers with suspenders, and an open white shirt sloppily tucked in over his enormous belly. He wears a hat to protect him from the white-hot sun, and proudly displays a gold watch and chain over his vest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sits in a chair, near a group of his men in the garden, listening to the Widow, who stands before him with her only son.

</WIDOW>
<DIRECTION>
The boy runs as fast as he can out through the gates. Then there is a lupara blast. He turns, and sees his Mother flung a distance of five feet from the short range of the terrible blast of the shotgun. Then he sees the men turn their attention to him. One fires at him; but the boy is quick, and disappears into a grove of olive trees.

EXT. STREETS OF CORLEONE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

Two men roam the deserted streets of Corleone, carrying lupare. Every so often, they stop, and one shouts in a loud, almost singsong voice, like a fish peddler. Their names are MOSCA and STROLLO.

<DIRECTION>
The hundreds of immigrant families sit on rows of benches in the great hall. Various painted lines lead to the steps and processing rooms above.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is the babble of many interviews going on simultaneously, uncertainly, in different languages.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vito is bundled in an old coat, with a large tag pinned on it: "Vitone Andolini -- Corleone, Sicilia."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stands, moves up in the line, when several other immigrant boys, older than he, rush up an push him back in the line. Weak from the trip, he falls to the floor. The boys laugh, derisive in a language he cannot understand. He struggles to his feet, lifting his makeshift bags; staring at them in an icy hatred.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PROCESSING ROOM - DAY

Three or four interviews are crowded into the small room; they are conducted in English. From the expression on Vito's face, and from the fragmented of the English, we realize that he doesn't understand a word of it.

He opens the door, and Vito enters the room.

The VIEW slowly begins to pull back, revealing this to be the view from inside the quarantine cell, where Vito stands on his bench, looking out to the statue through the barred window.

Then he turns, and sits in the corner. He is silent for a long time.

Then, in a sweet, pure voice, he sings to himself in Sicilian.

A nine year old boy, dressed immaculately in white, with a large white silk bow tied to his shoulder, moving slowly down the aisle of the church with a group of other children dressed in white. He has dark black hair, and his face is unmistakably similar to young Vito's. He moves slowly, his hands clasped around a golden missal. We HEAR only the pure voice of Vito in Sicilian, his sad song reaching out from the past, as ANTHONY CORLEONE, his Grandson, moves on the way to his First Holy Communion more than fifty years later.

The lawns of this great estate on the shore of Lake Tahoe are covered with guests of a wonderful party to honor the First Holy Communion of Anthony Corleone, the son of Mr. and Mrs. Michael Corleone. A full dance orchestra plays music of the times on a pavilion bandstand built especially for the occasion. Speedboats roar through the water, pulling youthful waterskiers; and the pool and private harbor are filled with laughing, swimming guests. It is Fall of 1958.

MICHAEL CORLEONE sits on a large sofa, his back to us. Standing to one side is a tired and somewhat uneasy TOM HAGEN. Standing before Michael is SANDRA CORLEONE, Sonny's widow; her daughter, one of the twins, FRANCESCA CORLEONE, and a handsome young man of twenty, GARDNER SHAW.

Neri closes the door, and Michael looks at the nervous young man.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Francesca is my oldest brother's daughter. He died many years ago, and ever since I've felt much more of a father than an uncle. I love her very much. I'm pleased and impressed that you had the thought to come to me before going on with your plans. It shows me that you're a considerate man, and will be good to her. What are you studying in college?

</GARDNER>
<MICHAEL>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course I give you my blessing. Let's set the wedding soon...it will be my pleasure to give the bride away.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and take a few courses in Business Administration just to be on the safe side!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
They laugh; Michael moves toward them. Francesca throws her arms around him, and kisses her favorite uncle. The flushed young man shakes his hand heartily.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCESCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Uncle Michael.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCA>
<DIRECTION>
They all take their leave; Michael turns to Hagen.

<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Later. Tom?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
Hagen brings him a folder; then, as Michael glances through it:
</DIRECTION>
<HAGEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've cleared it through the Senator's chief aide, a man named Turnbull. Turnbull's a heavy gambler, and into us for over a hundred grand, so I figure his information is reliable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAGEN>
<DIRECTION>
Neri moves to the bar, to prepare Michael a drink.
</DIRECTION>
<HAGEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Senator can be set up; but he thinks of himself as a clean politician. So it's got to be on terms he can live with: campaign contribution, donation to a charitable cause that he controls, things like that. If he gets even the inkling that you think you're buying him, he'll freeze up. Nevada's a funny state, they like things both ways here... All right. Turnbull says the Senator will be here at two-thirty, and he's been primed. He knows you'll want to meet with him alone, and he knows it's about the Tropicana's license. At any rate, he expects to be introduced around to some of the influential people here today, and generally treated as an ordinary guest. Just go light on him, Mikey, sometimes the biggest crooks don't like to think of themselves as crooks...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAGEN>
<DIRECTION>
Michael glances at Hagen, as though that last remark was unnecessary.
</DIRECTION>
<HAGEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry; of course, you know that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAGEN>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two-thirty. That gives me time to see my boy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<HAGEN>

	Connie's outside.

</HAGEN>

Michael doesn't want to see her.

</HAGEN>
<DIRECTION>
Michael nods.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right. Apologize to Pentangeli.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
Neri opens the door; Hagen exits, and Connie steps in impatiently, followed by Merle.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said I would see my sister, alone.

	I saw him with you.

	We're going to Europe next week. I want to get passage booked on the Queen.

<MERLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're going to get married first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERLE>
<DIRECTION>
Michael is silent. Then he rises, and moves to the window overlooking the lake.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The ink on your divorce isn't dry. Your children see you on weekends; your oldest boy, Michael Francis... was in some trouble with the Reno police over some petty theft that you don't even know about.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<CONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Michael...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONNIE>
<MICHAEL>

	You fly around the world with lazy young men who don't have any love for you, and use you like a whore.

</CONNIE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then why do you come to me?

<CONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I need MONEY!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONNIE>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Connie, I want to be reasonable with you. You have a house here, with us. You can live here with your kids...and you won't be deprived of anything. I don't know much about Merle; I don't know what he does for a living; what he lives on. Why don't you tell him marriage is really out of the question; and that you can't see him any more. He'll understand. But if you disobey me, and marry this pimp...it would disappoint me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<CONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was my father's money; and I'm entitled to what I need. Where is Tom Hagen?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
She turns angrily, leaving Michael standing face to face with Merle.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you finished?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<MERLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERLE>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>

Merle puts out his cigarette and leaves, quickly.

<DIRECTION>
VIEW ON THE HARBOR AREA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Francesca and her twin, Gardner and their elite young friends roar out of the private harbor, to get up on the water skis. We notice ROCCO LAMPONE, move along a path leading to a separate and more private boathouse. A small covered craft approaches, ties off, and a group of three men step on to the pathway, shake hands with Lampone - and follow him to the large boathouse where Michael conducts his business.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, give us a tarantella.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENTANGELI>
<DIRECTION>
He waves his hands, conducting, and singing. The piano starts a vamp, the drums uncertainly join in. A clarinet starts to play "Pop Goes the Weasel," and soon the rest of the orchestra is playing that. They look to Pentangeli for approval. Disgusted, he goes back to his table, eating a handful of canapes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE BOATHOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rocco ushers an older Italian, bundled up against the cold and wet of his boatride, to Michael.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man shows respect to Michael, who quickly indicates that Neri should get him a drink.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rocco, his friends must be hungry. See what you can do, but I'd like to keep them away from the guests.

The older man, JOHNNY 'BLUE BOY' OLA, gestures to his bodyguards, and they follow Lampone.

Tom shakes hands with Ola, remembering him, and his importance.

	Tom isn't going to sit in with us, Johnny. He only handles specific areas of the family business. Tom?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, Mikey.
	</DIALOGUE>

He gathers up some of his papers, as the three men remain silent, waiting for him to go before they talk. It's clear Tom doesn't want to be excluded.

<OLA>

	The hotel's registered owners are one Jacob Lawrence, and Sidney Barclay, both Beverly Hills attorneys. In reality it's split between the Old Lakeville Road Group from Cleveland, and our friend in Miami. He takes care of others outside the country, you know who I mean. Meyer Klingman runs the store, and does all right, but I've been instructed to tell you, that if you move him out, our friend in Miami will go along with you.
	</DIALOGUE>

	He's very kind, tell him it's appreciated. I'm sure it will be profitable all the way around.

</MICHAEL>
<OLA>

	He always makes money for his partners. One by one, our old friends are gone. Death, natural or not, prison, deported. Our friend in Miami is the only one left, because he always made money for his partners.

A moment goes by, and then Tom Hagen enters, closing the door behind him.

	It was very kind of you to come to my home on this occasion, Senator. My wife has been very concerned with making a good impression on the people who are our neighbors, and your appearance here has made her very happy. If I can ever perform a service for you, you only have to ask.

Michael nods, indicating that he should do so.

<SENATOR_GEARY>

	The Corleone family controls two major hotels in Vegas; one in Reno. The licenses were grandfathered in, so you had no difficulties with the Gaming Commission. But I have the idea from sources...

With great strength, Fanucci lifts one of them up into the air and throws him down hard to the concrete; but another, holding onto his back, manages to produce a switchblade knife and awkwardly reaching around from behind the moving man, slits Fanucci's throat from one side to the other.

	You know his friends...real animals. And his connections with the police. Sure he'd like us to tell him our plans so he can set us up for the cops and earn their gratitude. Then they would owe him a favor; that's how he operates. We'll have to pay. Three hundred, are we agreed?

Tell him you have to get the money and will send me as your messenger. Let him understand that you're willing to pay what he asks, don't bargain. I'll go to his house, and quarrel with him. He likes me; enjoys explaining how things are here. He uses ten sentences when he only needs one, so while he talks, I'll kill him.

EXT. NEW YORK STREET - MED. VIEW - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A ten piece Italian street band plays in front of the church to commemorate the first night of the Festa di San Gennaro. People swarm in crowds, delighted by the music, as out of the church four men carry the statue of San Gennaro down to the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVING VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clemenza moves along the booths that have been set up along the street: sausage cooking on an open fire; pork livers and sweetbeards. He stops for a sandwich, and makes an irritated gesture when the vendor expects to be paid. He crosses to a church-sponsored booth with a great Wheel of Fortune, and slaps a dollar on a number. Standing next to him is Vito; they embrace.

Vito passes the booths of food, crossing toward a small and dark club.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SOCIAL CLUB - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We can still HEAR the crowds and music of the festa. Vito enters; the club is empty, except for the large white figure sitting alone at a small table. Fanucci barely acknowledges Vito as he joins him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Without a word, Vito counts out two hundred dollars on the table. Fanucci looks, then takes off his fedora and puts it on the table over the money.

EXT. FESTA STREET - MED. VIEW - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
By now the musicians have left, but still families are walking the street, and stopping at the booths.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fanucci stands there a moment; he is known by everyone, and considers himself highly loved.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then Fanucci begins the walk through the festa, on his way home.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROOFTOPS - MOVING VIEW - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vito silently moves along the rooftop; paralleling Fanucci's walk.

Vito makes the leap that separates two buildings; then crosses toward the large skylight in the center of the building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE STREETS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The procession in the streets is preceded by ten altar boys; and the glittering Monstrance, something of an altar carried out into the streets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The priest begins this nocturnal service, as the crowds in the street kneel down in prayer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FANUCCI'S BUILDING - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Fanucci unlocks the door to his building; we can HEAR the services in the background.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE ROOFTOP - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vito tries the trap door on the roof; it is stuck firmly shut; despite Clemenza's instructions. He struggles with it, but no luck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the distance, the Choir begins to Latin. Vito moves around the skylight, to an identical trap, tries this one; it opens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FANUCCI'S HALLWAY - DOWN ANGLE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fanucci proceeds up the staircase with loud, heavy steps. An OLD WOMAN on one of the flights sees him, and immediately moves to her apartment.
</DIRECTION>
<FANUCCI>

	<DIALOGUE>
	'Good evening,' Signor Fanucci.

<DIRECTION>
She quickly disappears behind her door. Fanucci laughs, continues up, singing to himself. The MASS outside is always in evidence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vito climbs down from the attic, and finds Fanucci's rear door open. He slips in, and makes his way past the open windows, out of which pour the music and chanting of the Mass. Slowly and quietly he pulls them down, shut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He moves quietly to a glass door, and peeks out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHAT HE SEES:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Three young women, Fanucci's DAUGHTERS, laughing and talking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIEW ON VITO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A slip up. Tessio had said they were out. He steps outside to the alley where he can look into the apartment.

<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER VIEW

Fanucci opens the door of his apartment, and enters.

He begins to wrap the gun.

Their father greets them with a kiss; and a little religious gift he has bought for each.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON THE GUN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
wrapped in this primitive method of a silencer. The VIEW TILTS to Vito, caught in the dilemma of having to kill all or none of them. Then something catches his eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHAT HE SEES:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small gray alley cat is attracted to the young man, comes up to him and rubs itself against him. Vito rubs the animal, speaking softly in Sicilian, then, gaining its confidence, lifts it up and carefully lets it into Fanucci's apartment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He steps back, holding the gun. We HEAR some Italian shouted in the house; a loud sound from the cat, and some of the thumping footsteps of Fanucci.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIEW ON VITO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
holding the wrapped gun, waiting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHAT HE SEES:

The white blob of Fanucci opening the door and cursing in Italian as he throws the cat out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIEW ON VITO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
squeezing the trigger; the muffled, but still LOUD BLAST resounding in the building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIEW ON FANUCCI
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He holds onto the door frame, trying to stand erect, trying to reach for his gun. The force of his struggle has torn the buttons off his jacket and made it swing loose. His gun is exposed but so is a spidery vein on the white shirtfront of his stomach. Carefully, as if plunging a needle into this vein, Vito Corleone fires a second bullet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fanucci falls to his knees, propping the door open, giving a terrible groan. We begin to hear the VOICES of girls inside the apartment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vito quickly opens his wallet, removes the two hundred, quickly fires one last bullet into Fanucci's sweaty cheek. Now the towel the gun was wrapped with catches fire, literally on Vito's hand; quickly he throws it to the ground, stamps it out...and disappears upward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE ROOFTOPS - MED. VIEW - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vito moves like a cat along the rooftops; we HEAR the conclusion of the Mass down below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON VITO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pausing; we can SEE the great spectacle of lights and candles on the streets below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He empties the gun of bullets and smashes the barrel against the side of the roof ledge. He reverses it in his hand, and breaks the butt into two separate halves against the chimney. He smashes it again, and the pistol breaks into barrel and handle, two separate pieces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He then moves along the rooftop, dropping the two separate fragments into various air shafts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE STREET PROCESSION - MOVING VIEW - NIGHT

The Priest, having completed the ceremony, follows as the Monstrance is carried off through the streets, as the Choir sings.

Vito's wife; her baby and several friends and neighbors sit happily on the front stoop of their tenement. Some of the men drink wine poured out of a pitcher; we can still HEAR the music and night sounds of the Festa.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A neighbor is singing a Neapolitan song.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quietly, without a word, and with only a momentary glance from his wife, Vito joins the little group; takes a glass of wine, and listens to the song.
</DIRECTION>

INT. ANTHONY'S TAHOE ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is large, lit from the outside by a bright evening. We can see the outline of many toys on the shelves built along the wall. We see the dark figure of Michael Corleone enter the room and approach the bed where his son Anthony lies curled in messy blankets. Michael quietly arranges his small hands and feet and covers the little boy. Suddenly, Anthony turns, his eyes open. He is staring, perfectly awake, at his father.

INT. MICHAEL-KAY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is lit from a small night lamp on Michael's side of the large bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kay is huddled in blankets, asleep. Michael closes the door to his room, moves to his side of the bed, and glances down to the pillow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIEW ON THE PILLOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is a child's drawing of a long limousine, with a man in a hat sitting in the back seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An arrow pointing to him is marked "DAD." Under it, a nine year old's handwriting says: "Do you like it? Check YES __ I liked it or NO __ I didn't like it." Michael turns, looking for a pencil, and moves to the dresser, where he places a check next to "YES."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to cross back toward his side of the bed, when Kay turns, almost in her sleep:
</DIRECTION>
<KAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Michael? Why are the drapes open?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAY>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes dart back to the curved, beautifully leaded windows of the room. The DRAPES are opened. Then, without a second's hesitation, he leaps to the floor, still holding his son's drawing, as a spray of machine gun bullets sweep across the windows; glass shattering all over the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kay screams out; rising, still half-asleep. Michael crawls toward her, and pulls her down to the floor to him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, for a moment, there is silence, soon filled by the shouts of men; as flashes of light sweep by the window, as guards with flashlights come running.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael holds Kay to him, knowing they have both survived, and then gently:
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go with the kids.

EXT. THE TAHOE ESTATE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

The character of the summer estate has changed: bright floodlights illuminate the main points of entry: the main gate; the waterway; the stone wall that encompasses the estate on all sides.

INT. MICHAEL'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kay, the children, and some women servants have come down from the various rooms into the central living area, that can be most easily secured. The little girl is still asleep; they make you think of an immigrant family, with their blankets and frightened faces, all waiting in a central room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael goes up to Kay, squeezes her hand, and whispers:
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It will be all right. We were lucky.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
She says nothing; but her face expresses the anger she feels over the jeopardy Michael has placed his children in. She holds her young daughter in her arms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens, and Rocco enters. He quickly realizes he is holding his gun in plain view in front of the family, and puts it away. Michael moves to him, and they talk a distance away from Kay.

EXT. TAHOE ESTATE - HIGH ANGLE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael walks the short distance from his house, to the boathouse where he conducts his business away from his family.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small group of bodyguards, carrying machine guns, make the walk with him from all sides, a respectful distance away. It gives the appearance of a lonely President moving in his compound, followed by teams of Secret Service men.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boathouse is already secured by teams of men, hastily wakened from their lodge house; a barracks-like structure where reinforcements are lodged just for this kind of emergency.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FULL VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the distance, we can see the teams of men and dogs, with their lights, guns and shouts, combing every inch of the estate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE BOATHOUSE - EMPTY VIEW - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael alone in the great room. He moves to a walk-in safe, quickly runs through the combination, and opens it. He takes out an envelope, and puts it into his pocket; there's a KNOCK on the door, and Hagen enters. He had been asleep, and has quickly thrown on a robe.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sit down, Tom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TAHOE BOATHOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From outside the leaded windows, a disoriented Hagen sits down; Michael starts to talk to him; obviously about something very serious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The patrol securing the boathouse, walk past the window. Michael says something to Tom, who rises, and pulls the drapes, obscuring OUR VIEW.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TAHOE BOATHOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael talks intimately to Tom.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's a lot I can't tell you, Tom. I know that's upset you in the past; and you've felt that it was because of some lack of trust or confidence. But it is because I do trust you that I've kept so much secret from you. It's precisely that at this moment, you are the only one that I can completely trust. In time, you'll understand everything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<HAGEN>
<DIRECTION>
(nods with this statement)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But your people... Neri... Rocco; you don't think...

</HAGEN>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I have confidence in their loyalty... but this is life and death, and Tom, you are my brother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
Hagen in very moved.
</DIRECTION>
<HAGEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mikey, I hoped...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAGEN>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No Tom, just listen. All my people are businessmen; their loyalty is based on that. One thing I learned from my father is to try to think as the people around you think...and on that basis, anything is possible. Fredo has a good heart, but he is weak...and stupid, and stupid people are the most dangerous of all. I've kept you out of things, Tom, because I've always known that your instincts were legitimate, and I wanted you to know very little of things that would make you an accomplice, for your own protection. I never blamed you for the setbacks the family took under Sonny; I know you were in a position of limited power, and you did your best to advise and caution him. What I am saying is that now, for how long I do not know, you will be the Don. If what I think has happened is true; I will leave tonight, and absolutely no one will know how to contact me. And even you are not to try to reach me unless it is absolutely necessary. I give you complete power: over Neri... Fredo, everyone. I am trusting you with the lives of my wife and children, and the future of this family, solely resting on your judgment and talent.

<DIRECTION>
taking out the envelope.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've prepared this; have had it for over a month. It won't explain everything; but indicates where I will be, so in a sense, it is my life.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he hands the envelope to Hagen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Also, there are three tasks that must be executed immediately. Pop would have given those to Luca -- You knew Pop as well as anyone, act as though you were him. It discusses Kay as well; that will be the most difficult. The men who tried to kill me tonight, will never leave the estate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<HAGEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will we...be able to get who ordered it out of them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAGEN>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think so. Unless I'm very wrong...they're already dead. Killed by someone inside...very frightened that they botched it. That's why I am going to disappear in a few minutes, and leave everything to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<HAGEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But if you're wrong...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAGEN>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I'm wrong...
	</DIALOGUE>

There is a KNOCK on the door.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.

The door opens; it is Rocco; Michael rises, after making a knowing glance toward Tom, and moves to talk quietly to a frightened and agitated Rocco.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STONE WALL AND STREAM - MOVING VIEW - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A group of men with flashlights and guns lead Michael, Tom and Rocco to the stone bridge spanning the stream which runs through the estate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOW CLOSE VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael's dispassionate face, looking down. THE VIEW MOVES to Hagen's, and then down to the murky water under the bridge, where we see the bodies of three strangers, lying in the moving water; machine-type guns nearby, with their throats cut. Light from the many flashlights illuminates the grotesque scene.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fish them out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
Several of the men wade down into the stream; Rocco helps, and even Tom steps down to get a better look at who they were. They are total strangers; Rocco examines the type of guns they used.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When they climb back onto the ground, Michael is gone. Everyone notices it, but no one says anything.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hagen stands there, holding the envelope Michael had given him in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He realizes that now, he is the DON.
</DIRECTION>
<HAGEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get rid of the bodies. Tomorrow morning I want a report made to the local police, and paper, that some explosives we keep on the property were accidentally ignited.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAGEN>
<DIRECTION>
The men respond; Hagen makes the lonely walk back to the lighted section of the compound, which now resembles a prison camp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT.

<HAGEN>

<SENATOR_GEARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No strings.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SENATOR_GEARY>
<HAGEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know there's a Senate Investigating Committee recently set up; we thought it would be unfortunate if they were to trace anything though-provoking to your name.

	No one can trace anything to me; I pride myself on that.

Geary quickly looks through the paid markers.

	There's thirty grand worth of paid off markers -- I never owed that much.

	We'll keep it quiet; the people who know are trustworthy...the Committee needn't find out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAGEN>
<SENATOR_GEARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what's the price of their not finding out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SENATOR_GEARY>

	Simple. Be friendly like us. Not hostile.

Ola's car leads Michael's through a middle-class suburban area of $30,000 to $40,000 homes. There are small channels with sporting and fishing boats parked near the houses. Ola's car pulls up in front of a very simple, tract-type home. Michael's car parks nearby.

Ola rings the bell, and after a moment, a rather pretty, middle-aged WOMAN answers, remaining behind the screen door. Ola says a few things to her and she disappears, leaving the door open.

Ola comes down the steps, looks at Michael, nodding to him. Ola then gets into his car and drives off. Michael walks up the walkway and enters the little house, closing the door behind him.

</ROTH>
<MICHAEL>

	Technically, they are still under the Clemenza wing of the Corleone Family, now run by Frankie Pentangeli. After Clemenza died, the Rosatos wanted territory of their own. Pentangeli refused, and came to me, asking for permission to eliminate them. I, of course, knew of their relationship with you, and in gratitude for your help with the Tropicana matter, turned him down. Pentangeli was furious, and paid one hundred and fifty thousand dollars to have me killed. I was lucky and he was stupid. I'll visit him soon.

<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pentangeli is a dead man; do you object?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<ROTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's always bad for business; but you have no choice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROTH>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then it's done. I must choose his replacement: it cannot be Rosato.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<ROTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course you must keep control of your family.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROTH>
<DIRECTION>
He turns to Michael, turning the volume higher on the television, and moving closer to his young partner.
</DIRECTION>
<ROTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Michael, these things are unimportant. Who should be the manager of a dime store, Joe or Jack? Unimportant. You do what you think is right. You're a young man, and I'm old and sick. What we do together in the next few months will be history, Michael; it has never been done before. We will do this historical thing together, and even your Father could never dream it would be possible. We are bigger than U.S. Steel, you and me... because in America, anything is possible!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But soon I will be dead, and it will all belong to you.

</ROTH>
<DIRECTION>
There is a KNOCK on the door, and Terri Roth pushes the door open with her hip.
</DIRECTION>
<TERRI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My goodness, you'll rupture your eardrums, Hyman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRI>
<DIRECTION>
She puts the tray down, and turns down the television.

The sinister Bussetta waits patiently in the rear seat of the car, outside Roth's modest house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DOWNTOWN NEW YORK - MOVING VIEW - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A black Cadillac moves down the street, slowed by the Festivities of the Festa that is in progress: people milling around, buying souvenirs at the many stands set up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sausage and grilled meats are prepared, just as they were years ago. Electric lights are strung from the street lamps, and brightly colored banners pronounce the "Festa of the Madonna."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVING CLOSE VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Willy Cicci drives, frustrated that he cannot go any faster. Next to him, Frankie Pentangeli sits, catching a few seconds' snooze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The black car pulls up; another car that had been following it parks nearby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of Pentangeli's button men gets out of the car, and steps into a small Italian restaurant; he exits quickly, and nods affirmatively toward Pentangeli's Cadillac.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The group of them step out quickly, men huddled around Pentangeli, and enter the restaurant.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE RESTAURANT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The restaurant is quite empty, despite the excitement out on the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pentangeli immediately sits at a table with a tall, dark, snappily dressed young man, CARMINE ROSATO.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nearby, on the other side of the room is Rosato's brother, TONY, seated with a group of their men.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At another table in the restaurant is a table of Pentangeli's people: they are joined by bodyguards.
</DIRECTION>
<PENTANGELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rosato, where's your brother?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENTANGELI>
<ROSATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sitting right behind you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSATO>
<DIRECTION>
Pentangeli glances behind himself.
</DIRECTION>
<PENTANGELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He don't want to talk?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENTANGELI>
<ROSATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We worked it all out beforehand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSATO>
<PENTANGELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are we going to eat or what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENTANGELI>
<ROSATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, on me. I got Diner's Club.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSATO>
<PENTANGELI>
<DIRECTION>
(sarcastically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forget it; I'm suddenly without an appetite. You're making big trouble, Carmine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENTANGELI>
<ROSATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You weren't straight with us, Frankie, what else could we do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSATO>
<PENTANGELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We could have talked first, saved a lot of running around.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENTANGELI>
<ROSATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wasn't listening, you didn't want to talk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSATO>
<PENTANGELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't I look like I'm listening?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENTANGELI>
<ROSATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We want Brooklyn one hundred percent. No more taxes to you. We want to be only loosely connected with your family -- sort of a under-family all of our own. Then we can act on all internal matters without talking. Also we want you to inform Michael Corleone that we can deal directly with him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSATO>
<PENTANGELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a little hungry, maybe I'll order something. Joe.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(one of his men)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get me some bracciole or something. And pay cash.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Rosato)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And in return for these concessions, what do you do for me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENTANGELI>
<ROSATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We will release the hostages, number one. Number two, we're here for you to count on when you need us. We're independent, but we're here if you need us. In general, we'll cooperate with you and your businesses, and you in turn will cooperate with us. Pari persu.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSATO>
<PENTANGELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pari Persu; what the fuck is Pari persu...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENTANGELI>
<ROSATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My lawyer went over this beforehand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSATO>
<PENTANGELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What assurances do I have that there will be no more kidnapping, no more hits?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENTANGELI>
<ROSATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The same assurance we got from you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSATO>
<PENTANGELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if I say shove it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENTANGELI>
<ROSATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then Carmine Fucillo and Tony Blue DeRosa will need to be fitted for slabs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSATO>
<PENTANGELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want a war?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENTANGELI>
<ROSATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We got no choice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSATO>
<PENTANGELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know if there's a way I'll go to the commission and the commission will side with me. That puts me and the other New York families against you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENTANGELI>
<ROSATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We got friends in the commission.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSATO>
<PENTANGELI>
<DIRECTION>
(getting angry)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm talking about Italians!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENTANGELI>
<ROSATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about Michael Corleone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSATO>
<PENTANGELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He supports me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENTANGELI>
<ROSATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe, yes... maybe no.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSATO>
<DIRECTION>
One of Pentangeli's men approaches with a plate of Italian food.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pentangeli stands up, angered by this remark of Rosato's; he pushes the dish of food out of the surprised Bodyguard's hands.
</DIRECTION>
<PENTANGELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You drove old Pete Clemenza to his grave, Carmine; you and your brother. Turning on him; trouble in his territories -- you and your demands. I hold you responsible, just as though you shot him in the head. And I ain't gonna let that go for long!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENTANGELI>
<DIRECTION>
Pentangeli walks out of the restaurant; there's a little tension between the bodyguards of the two factions.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSATO>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Five-Angels...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSATO>
<DIRECTION>
He gives him the arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frankie's face turns red, like he wants to have it out here and now; but Willy Cicci calms his down, and they all make their move out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE RESTAURANT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pentangeli gets into the car.
</DIRECTION>
<PENTANGELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nobody I hate calls me Five-Angels to my face!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENTANGELI>
<DIRECTION>
He slams the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PENTANGELI'S LONG BEACH ESTATE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Part of the old estate of Don Corleone. By now, the wall has been torn down, and the other houses sold off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His car is parked; Pentangeli steps out, still angry over the confrontation. As he approaches the house, he notices something strained about the bodyguards who discreetly guard his house. No one seems to want to tell him.
</DIRECTION>
<PENTANGELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENTANGELI>
<DIRECTION>
Pentangeli glances over to the front door foyer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PENTANGELI'S VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The strange and silent Bussetta, the man who now always travels with Michael.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PENTANGELI'S HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pentangeli enters; he sees his WIFE, standing oddly in the hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<PENTANGELI>
<DIRECTION>
(Sicilian)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENTANGELI>
<WIFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Michael Corleone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WIFE>
<PENTANGELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One Michael Corleone...Dove?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENTANGELI>
<WIFE>
<DIRECTION>
(Sicilian)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's in your study.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WIFE>
<DIRECTION>
He knows it is very very serious for Michael to be here in his home.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He automatically moves into his study.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PENTANGELI'S STUDY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael stands quietly in the room. This was once his father's study, although it is totally redecorated. Pentangeli starts sweating, and moves toward the young Don, and kisses his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<PENTANGELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don Corleone, I wish you let me know you was coming. We could have prepared something for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENTANGELI>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't want you to know I was coming. You heard what happened in my home?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<PENTANGELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Michael, yes, we was all relieved...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENTANGELI>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(furious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In my home! In the same room where my wife was sleeping; where my children come in their pajamas, and play with their toys.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
He's terrified Pentangeli with his anger; then, just as suddenly, he talks quietly, calmly.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want you to help me take my revenge.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<PENTANGELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Michael, anything. What is it I can do for you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENTANGELI>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want you to settle these troubles with the Rosato Brothers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<PENTANGELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was just going to contact you, Michael; we just had a 'sit-down' - in fact, I just come from there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENTANGELI>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want you to settle on their terms.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<PENTANGELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mike, I don't understand. Don't ask me to do that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENTANGELI>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Trust me; do as I ask.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<PENTANGELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It would be the beginning of the end for my family. How can I keep all my other territories in like if I let two wise-guys stand up and demand this and that, and then give it to them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENTANGELI>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frankie...do you respect me? Do I have your loyalty?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<PENTANGELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Always... But sometimes I don't understand. I know I'll never have your kind of brains, in big deals. But Mike, this is a street thing. And Hyman Roth in Miami is behind the Rosato Brothers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENTANGELI>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<PENTANGELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then why do you want me to lay down to them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENTANGELI>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(coldly, but convincing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frankie, Roth tried to have me killed. I'm sure it was him, but I don't know yet why.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<PENTANGELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus Christ, Michael, then let's hit 'em now, while we still got the muscle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENTANGELI>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This was my father's old study. When I was a kid, we had to be quiet when we played near here. When I was older, I learned many things from him here. I was happy that this house never went to strangers; first Clemenza took it over, and then you. My father taught me, in this room, never to act until you know everything that's behind things. Never. If Hyman Roth sees that I interceded with you in the Rosato Brothers' favor, he'll think his relationship with me is still sound. I'm going somewhere to meet him tomorrow. We have friends in some very important business that we're making. Do this for me; you make the peace with the Rosato Brothers on their terms. Let the word out that I forced you; you're not happy wit hit, but acquiesced, just because of me. It will get back to Hyman Roth. Do this, Frankie. You can trust me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<PENTANGELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, Mike. I'll go along.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENTANGELI>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
They embrace; Michael kisses him. He looks at the young Don, thoughtfully.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TROPICANA HOTEL - CLOSE VIEW - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The money trays are carefully unloaded from the gaming tables, and put on a cart with others.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cart, preceded and followed by security guards, is then wheeled through the casino, into a private, counting room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COUNTING ROOM - MED. VIEW - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The guards leave the room; the door is locked after them, leaving only Hagen. Neri and an ACCOUNTANT, a very fat man. The numbered boxes are opened, and cash and checks are spread out on the counting table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The accountant begins with amazing speed and skill, to count and divide the money.
</DIRECTION>
<NERI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fifteen percent skim?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NERI>
<HAGEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twenty-five this time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAGEN>
<DIRECTION>
The accountant stops, and looks up to Neri.
</DIRECTION>
<NERI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It might show.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NERI>
<HAGEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mike wants it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAGEN>
<DIRECTION>
Neri nods, and the accountant continues. Neri opens a door, allowing a sandy-haired man, a COURIER, into the room. The cream is placed into his pouch personally by Neri.
</DIRECTION>
<NERI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've never sent this much with one courier.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NERI>
<HAGEN>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your plans are a little different this time. You skip Miami, and go straight to Geneva. It's to be deposited to this number.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(handing him a small envelope)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And it's got to be there by Monday morning, no slip-up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAGEN>
<COURIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I was 'picked-up' last trip. That hour layover I had at Kennedy. I went over and bought a paper...
	</DIALOGUE>
</COURIER>
<DIRECTION>
Neri has finished putting the 'creamed' money into the pouch.
</DIRECTION>
<NERI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those were our people.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NERI>
<COURIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, just thought you should know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COURIER>
<DIRECTION>
He is just about to close and lock the pouch, when Hagen gestures that he should wait, and adds more stacks of carefully packaged bills into the pouch. Then Neri locks it, and handcuffs it to the courier's arm, looking inquiringly at Hagen.
</DIRECTION>
<HAGEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let them count.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAGEN>
<DIRECTION>
The courier is shown out through a private door, and then the first door is opened. Two accountants come in with the guards, and the trays are opened, and the counting process is begun all over again, this time with the State Tally sheets.
</DIRECTION>

</NERI>
<HAGEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No questions.

</HAGEN>
<NERI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got to ask questions, Tom, there's three million dollars cash in that pouch; Mike is gone and I have no word from him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NERI>
<HAGEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Al, as far as you're concerned, I'm the Don.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAGEN>
<NERI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do I know you haven't gone into business for yourself?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NERI>
<DIRECTION>
This hurts Tom; but he is a reasonable man, and he knows he owes Neri some explanation.
</DIRECTION>
<HAGEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've been through a lot with us so I'm going to give you the truth. Mike knows it was someone within the compound that set him up for that hit. So nobody is to know where he is, not you, not Rocco, not even his brother Fredo. Sorry, Al, I know how you feel about Mike...but he still remembers Tessio.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAGEN>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. KEY WEST - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael is led to a desolate, night-lit private dock. He is followed by the ever-present Bussetta, and they are helped onto a light-weight, luxury cabin cruiser. The crew cast off various ropes, and the boat sets out into the night.
</DIRECTION>

FADE OUT.

<DIRECTION>
FADE IN:

EXT. TAHOE ESTATE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A seaplane lands nicely by the private Corleone harbor; Hagen disembarks with his inevitable overloaded briefcase. He continues down the ramp, past several Buttonmen, dressed in summer casual attire, and who resemble secret service men rather than thugs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His wife THERESA lies on a blanket on the great lawn, with her youngest children, who run to their father for a kiss.
</DIRECTION>
<THERESA>

EXT. TAHOE LAWN BARBECUE - MED. VIEW - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hagen and Sonny's boys are throwing a football around on the lawn; the littler kids running after them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coals are burning in the old style stone barbecue, and several tables are set for the family.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the distance, there is always evidence of the bodyguards.
</DIRECTION>

Theresa, Mama and Sandra prepare the steaks.

<DIRECTION>
Hagen relaxes in a sports shirt.

<HAGEN>

He crosses the lawn, to the house on the beach where Michael and his family live. Is about to knock on the door:
</DIRECTION>
<HAGEN_S_SON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Pop, heads up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAGEN_S_SON>

The football is flying in his direction; he catches it and throws it back. Then he cracks the door open, and peeks in.

INT. MICHAEL'S HOUSE - DAY

He steps in, the beautiful summer living room is neat, but empty.
</DIRECTION>
<HAGEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyone hungry?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAGEN>
<DIRECTION>
He moves through the house more quickly; into the dining and recreation room areas. A cat jumps off a pile of cushions and runs across the room.

<SANDRA>

He swallows the drink down in several gulps. And then looks up to his men watching him. He's embarrassed to have shown such weakness.
</DIRECTION>
<HAGEN>

MICHAEL'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Crowded streets, occasional roving bands playing for the tourists; there is much evidence of tourism: Americans walking through the streets with cameras. Occasionally, we see a Cuban with a row of numbers attached to his hat, carrying a big sheet of the daily lottery numbers. From all of these street impressions, the city is booming with activity, but there is also much evidence of whores and pimps and little children begging in the streets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The big American car stops at an intersection. Bussetta is sitting in the forward passenger side; while Michael is in the back. He hears tapping on the window; he turns and sees four Cuban boys tapping on his window and extending their hands, and rubbing their stomachs as though they were hungry. The Cuban driver rolls down his window and shouts them away in Spanish.

Michael passes the phone on to Roth.
</DIRECTION>
<LEON>

A CUBAN STREET - LATE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Police are stopping traffic. Michael's Mercury is among the cars; a police officer, seeing that some important person is being driven, walks up to the driver. He leans forward, and says something in Spanish to the driver.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The driver, in turn, leans over to Michael.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He says it will just be a short time and they'll let us through.

</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
Michael looks out the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL'S VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The old building has been totally surrounded by police and military vehicles. Right at this moment, they are waiting lazily, but soldiers are there with automatic weapons ready. There is a momentary commotion inside the building, and the men brace up. A Captain of the Army detachment says something in Spanish over a megaphone; and his men put their weapons at the ready, as other policemen lead a group of civilians out of the building with their hands up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are moved over to some military truck, where they are frisked before being loaded.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All of a sudden, one of the civilian rebels breaks loose, and rushes toward the command vehicle. He hurls himself into the vehicle, as two police try to pull him out. A second later, and there is an explosion; the man obviously having hidden a grenade on his body, sacrificing his own life to take the life of the Captain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a commotion, but the military quickly quell it.

Some laugh. He nods, and they begin to cut it, put a piece on plates, and carry them to the different men.
</DIRECTION>
<ROTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everything we've learned in Vegas is true here; but we can go further. The bigger, the swankier, the plusher the store, the more a sense of legitimacy, and the bigger business we do.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looking at the plate brought to him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A smaller piece. What we've proposed to the Cuban Government is that it put up half the cash on a dollar for dollar basis.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(accepting a smaller piece)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you. We can find people in the United States who will put up our share for a small piece of the action, yet we will retain control.

<ONE_OF_THE_MEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How much?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ONE_OF_THE_MEN>

	A hundred million dollars. But only if this Government relaxes its restrictions on importing building materials; we'll need some new laws, too, but that will be no difficulty.

<ANOTHER_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are import duties now?

</ANOTHER_MAN>
<ROTH>

	As much as seventy percent. Also, I'm working out an arrangement with the Minister of Labor so that all our pit bosses, stick-men and Dealers, can be considered specialized technicians eligible for two year visas. As of now they're only allowed in Cuba for six months at a time. In short, we're in a full partnership with the Cuban Government.

The various men look up as Michael eats his cake, wondering what the point of it is.

	We're making a big investment in Cuba. That's my only concern.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<ROTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My concern is that the three million never arrived at Batista's numbered account in Switzerland. He thinks it's because you have second thoughts about his ability to stop the rebels.

	The money was sent.

	If only I could live to see it, kid; to be there with you. How beautifully we've done it, step by step. Here, protected, free to make our profits without the Justice Department, the FBI; ninety miles away in partnership with a friendly government. Ninety miles, just a small step, looking for a man who desperately wants to be President of the United States, and having the cash to make it possible.

His brother Sam is present, and the sandy-haired Courier, a little nervous; the one who had left from the Tropicana with the Corleone skim-money. Also Johnny Ola. The money is evidently all there; Roth picks up a packet; probably a hundred thousand dollars, and throws it over to the Courier.

<ROTH>

	There was this kid that I grew up with; he was a couple years younger than me, and sort of looked up to me, you know. We did our first work together, worked our way out of the street. Things were good and we made the most of it. During prohibition, we ran molasses up to Canada and made a fortune; your father too. I guess as much as anyone, I loved him and trusted him. Later on he had an idea to make a city out of a desert stop-over for G.I.'s on the way to the West Coast. That kid's name was Moe Greene, and the city he invented was Las Vegas. This was a great man; a man with vision and guts; and there isn't even a plaque or a signpost or a statue of him in that town. Someone put a bullet through his eye; no one knows who gave the order. When I heard about it I wasn't angry. I knew Moe; I knew he was headstrong, and talking loud, and saying stupid things. So when he turned up dead, I let it go, and said to myself: this is the business we've chosen. I never asked, who gave the go ahead because it had nothing to do with business.

The first time ever away from Michael, moving toward us quickly. He stops, knocks on the door of Roth's suite. Then quickly for a man his size, he moves without noise to the adjoining door, opens it with a key, and disappears inside.
</DIRECTION>

A moment elapses on the empty corridor, and then a roused Johnny Ola, opens the first door. He steps out into the corridor, to see who had knocked. Confused, he is about to return inside, when Bussetta easily breaks his neck in two from behind.

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A thin young man, almost gawky, walks down the street in this Italian neighborhood, his name is HYMAN SUCHOWSKY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He carries his tools as he comes home from work. He is pursued and tormented by a couple of Italian youths, about his own age, eighteen.
</DIRECTION>
<ITALIAN_BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kid, where do you live?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ITALIAN_BOY>
<ANOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where'd you get those nigger lips?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANOTHER>
<DIRECTION>
He tries not to be intimidated; finally one of the boys, steps in front of him and stops him.
</DIRECTION>
<ITALIAN_BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say 'bread' in Italian.

</ITALIAN_BOY>
<ANOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He dunno.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANOTHER>
<ITALIAN_BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go on; how do you say 'bread' in Italian? If you're from the neighborhood, you should know how to say 'bread' in Italian.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ITALIAN_BOY>
<DIRECTION>
An amused Peter Clemenza steps forward from a local coffee house, to preside over the fuss. He's a 'big' man in the neighborhood, and loves a fight.
</DIRECTION>
<CLEMENZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEMENZA>
<ITALIAN_BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This kid lives around here, but he can't say bread in Italian.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ITALIAN_BOY>
<CLEMENZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's 'cause he's Jew. Look at those pregnant lips!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEMENZA>
<DIRECTION>
He giggles at his own joke.
</DIRECTION>
<ITALIAN_BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you a Jewboy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ITALIAN_BOY>
<DIRECTION>
The boy doesn't answer, tries to keep going.
</DIRECTION>
<ITALIAN_BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, if you're not a Jew, say 'bread' in Italian. See, he can't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ITALIAN_BOY>
<DIRECTION>
And with that, he rounds a blow squarely to the boy's face, sending him sprawling to the cement, his tools flying with a clatter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The other Italian immediately joins in with a few kicks to the boy's stomach. Hyman tries to fight back; grabs a hold of his tormentor's foot, and brings him down on the cement as well. For a moment, they are rolling around on the sidewalk, two against one, Hyman taking the worst of it.
</DIRECTION>
<CLEMENZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright, alright, cut it out.

</CLEMENZA>
<HYMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HYMAN>
<CLEMENZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe I know how you can make a couple of extra bucks working as a mechanic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEMENZA>
<DIRECTION>
The boy seems agreeable.
</DIRECTION>
<CLEMENZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you gotta know how to keep your mouth shut, and fer Chrissakes, get rid of that name. I'll call you Johnny Lips.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he giggles at his own humor again)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEMENZA>
<DIRECTION>
He leads the boy down the street, whispering to him, on the side:
</DIRECTION>
<CLEMENZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bread in Italian is pane. P-A-N-E, pane. Don't forget.
	</DIALOGUE>

INT. NEW GENCO WAREHOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A newly acquired warehouse, stocked with cases of the new product "GENCO PURA" olive oil. It is the beginning of a new business, in the American tradition. Now they have one rattling old truck, and a few stock boys.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Genco has become the accountant-business manager, based on the experience working with his father. But it is clear, that Vito is the leader, and undisputed 'President' of the new enterprise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Genco moves through the darkness of the warehouse, to the small divided area that Vito uses as his office.

</GENCO>
<DIRECTION>
Vito nods that he will see him; and soon Roberto enters, on tiptoe, his hat in his hand, and in a apologetic voice.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me, I hope I am not a disturbance, Don Corleone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTO>
<VITO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VITO>
<ROBERTO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What a terrible misunderstanding. Of course, Signora Colombo can stay in the flat. Who were those miserable tenants to complain about noise from a poor animal...when they pay such low rent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTO>
<DIRECTION>
Then abruptly, he puts the roll of money on Vito's table, and steps back a respectful distance.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERTO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your good heart in helping the poor widow has shamed me, and I want to show that I, too, have some Christian charity. Her rent will remain what it was.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTO>
<VITO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VITO>
<ROBERTO>

Vito embraces him warmly.

<VITO>

	</DIALOGUE>
</VITO>
<ROBERTO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I won't keep you another minute...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERTO>
<DIRECTION>
He quickly takes his leave, bowing several times, and then makes it back to the safety of the warehouse; he sighs, deflates his lungs, and mops his brow; his bones have turned too jelly with fear at his narrow escape. He all but runs out of the warehouse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Genco laughs as he watches.
</DIRECTION>
<GENCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We won't see him for weeks! He'll stay in bed in the Bronx!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENCO>
<DIRECTION>
Clemenza has been waiting with his new mechanic. We notice the subtle difference in the way he treats Vito. He is no longer a junior apprentice in their petty crimes; but an imposing leader.
</DIRECTION>
<CLEMENZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This kid is good with cars; he kiijed at the truck, and says he can keep it going.

Genco is out in the alley; he calls out with glee.

Vito moves out to the smiling Genco; Clemenza and the newly christened Hyman Rothstein follow a distance behind.

</CICCI>
<DIRECTION>
The Senators treat Cicci with a surface courtesy, as if he were a curious kind of animal, not really human. Cicci reacts to this by being even more brutally forthright than he has to be, to show his contempt for what he considers a hypocrisy.

<DIRECTION>
Inside the estate, the private roads have been freshly plowed, and occasionally a worker will pause to watch the car as it passes.

The Grandchildren are in school now, and so the estate is especially quiet. Although there are signs that children live here; a bicycle, a sled, a swing and gymnastic set, wet and with a rim of snow still on it.

The front door opens, and Michael enters his own home. It is very quiet, no one is at home to greet him. He can see the evidence of his family; things his wife and his children have been using, and left on a sofa or a table.
</DIRECTION>

He moves toward his and Kay's bedroom, where we can HEAR the SOUND of a sewing machine running.

Quietly he opens the door.

Vitone and his young family: Mama, Santino, Fredo and the baby Michael are met at the small station in Sicily by friends, and Mama's relatives. There is a small band, playing for the occasion. A small man has brought a motor car to pick the family up; and there are certain dark men, with shotguns slung over their shoulders to preside over the occasion.
</DIRECTION>

The family is helped into the car; the luggage is packed on the roof, and the car drives off. The second car, with bodyguards following.

INT. VILLAGE COTTAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door is open -- the footsteps of a man enter the room. We follow these footsteps without quite knowing to whom they belong. They lead us to a bed, where we see asleep an OLD MAN. He sleeps in his undershirt and is sweating, covered by mosquito netting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIEW ALTERS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
and we realize that it is young Vito looking at the MAN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We remember that the man is MOSCA, one of three men, who almost twenty years before had hunted down Vito when he was a boy. With lightning speed, Vito slashes through the mosquito netting with a knife. And with the movement precise as a butcher's he disembowls this man.
</DIRECTION>

Vito has brought his wife and children to see the Olive Oil Depot which is the link to his New York importing business. They go inside.

<DIRECTION>
He is recognized as the second of the men who had hunted Vito down. STROLLO. As he walks we notice there is a figure that is moving through the drying sails and barrels, it is Vito. He moves quietly, stepping up behind the old man. In an instant, he has thrown a garrote around his throat, twisting it tight, so that there is very little sound.

The car stops at the gates, and an old guard sees and recognizes Tomasino, opens the gates allowing them to enter.

<DIRECTION>
The recognition of the name throws a shudder through him. It is as though he recognizes that this is the boy; the son of his old enemy, whom he had killed, and whose sons he had tried to wipe out. The old man raises his feeble hands signalling his guard, and in his weak voice, he shouts:

	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me agree with that. Many of my constituents are Italian and have been honored with that certain friendship by my close Italian friends. Up to this point before I have to leave this hearing to join my own committee, let me say, that this hearing on the Mafia is in no way a slur on the Italians by the Senate; nor is it meant to be; nor will I allow it to be. Italian Americans are the hardest working, most law abiding patriotic Americans of our country. It is a shame and a pity that a few rotten apples give them a bad name. We are here to weed those rotten apples out of the vast healthy barrel of Italian Americans, who are one of the backbones of our country.

<SENATOR_KANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sure we all agree with our esteemed colleague. Now, Mr. Corleone, you have been advised as to your legal rights. We have had testimony from a preceding witness who states you are head of the most powerful Mafia family in this country. Are you?

	No.

</SENATOR_KANE>
<HAGEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, my client has answered every question asked by this committee with the utmost cooperation and sincerity. He has not taken that Fifth Amendment as it was his right to do, and which because of the extreme legal complexity of this hearing, counsel advised him to do. So, I think in all fairness this committee should hear his statement and put it in the record.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In the hopes of clearing my family name, in the sincere desire to give my children their fair share of the American way of life without a blemish on their name and background I have appeared before this committee and given it all the cooperation in my power. I consider my being called before this committee an act of prejudice to all Americans of Italian extraction. I consider it a great dishonor to me personally to have to deny that I am a criminal. I wish to have the following noted for the record. That I served my country faithfully and honorably in World War II and was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for actions in defense of my country. That I have never been arrested or indicted for any crime whatsoever... that no proof linking me to any criminal conspiracy, whether it is called Mafia or Cosa Nostra or whatever other name you wish to give, has ever been made public. Only one man has made charges against me, and that man is known to be a murderer, arsonist and rapist. And yet this committee had used this person to besmirch my name. My personal protest can only be made to the people of this country. I can only thank God that in this country we have a legal system and courts of law to protect innocent people from wild accusation. I thank God for our democratic due process of Law that shields me from the false charges made by this committee's witness. I have not taken refuge behind the Fifth Amendment, though counsel advised me to do so. I challenge this committee to produce any witness or evidence against me, and if they do not, I hope they will have the decency to clear my name with the same publicity with which they have now besmirched it. I ask this without malice, in the interests of fair play.

	We are all impressed. The committee will now recess over the weekend. However, it will continue Monday morning, at eleven a.m. At that time, this committee will then produce a witness directly linking Mr. Corleone to the charges we have made. And then, Mr. Corleone may very well by liable for indictments of perjury. However, this document will be made a matter of record.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Roth engineered it, Michael. He made Pentangeli think you hit him. Deliberately letting him get off alive. Then the New York detectives turned Frankie over to the FBI. My informants say he was half dead and scared stiff -- talking out loud that you had turned on him and tried to kill him. Anyway, they had him on possession, dealing in heroin, murder one and a lot more. There's no way we can get to him and you've opened yourself to five points of perjury.

	The FBI guys promised me a deal. So I made up a lot of stuff about Michael Corleone. Because then, that's what they wanted. But it was all lies. Everything. They said Michael Corleone did this, Michael Corleone did that. So I said, "Yeah, sure."

Vincenzo stares at him, uncomprehending. There may just be a shadow of contempt. He doesn't answer.
</DIRECTION>
<HAGEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, the gentleman does not understand English. He would not in any case, take the stand. He came, at his own expense, to aid his brother in his trouble. He is not under any jurisdiction of our government and his reputation in his own country is impeccable.

	And that's all he had to do. Just show his face.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAY>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's all. You see, in Sicily, in the old days... there was only one legitimate reason to kill a blood relative... only one. IF he was a traitor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<KAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You would have killed his brother?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAY>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kay, you've got it wrong. That kind of thing's all over, I promised you. This was between the two brothers. Years ago Frankie had a young girlfriend; he called her his co-wife. That was his joke, but he meant it. He wouldn't divorce his wife... because she was a great cook. He said he girlfriend made a spaghetti sauce once and it was so terrible he knew he could never marry her. He set her up in a house in Jersey. She had to be faithful... and she had to have kids. And she did, two, a boy and a girl. He had her checked out and watched so she couldn't cheat... but the girl couldn't stand that kind of life. She begged him to let her go. He did. He gave her money and made her give up the kids. Then Frankie took them to Italy, and had them brought up by his brother Vincenzo. Where he knew they'd by safe.
	</DIALOGUE>

Kay begins to realize.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think Vincenzo would have done it. He loves the kids, too. Omerta, Kay. Honor, silence. It had nothing to do with me. It was between those brothers.

	I'll bring the children up now; they want to say goodbye.

	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<KAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I do feel things for you, Michael; but now, I think it's pity. For the first time since I've known you, you seem so helpless. You held me a prisoner once; will you try again?

	How can I let you leave; how can I let you take my children away? Don't you know me? You understand, it's an impossibility. I would never let it happen; no, never, not if it took all my strength, all my cunning. But in time, soon, you'll feel differently. You see, you'll be happy that I stopped you. I know you. You'll forget about this; you'll forget about the baby we lost... and we'll go on, you and I.

</MICHAEL>
<KAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It wasn't a miscarriage. And you with your cunning, couldn't you figure it out! It was an abortion; an abortion, like our marriage is an abortion, something unholy and evil. I don't want your son; I wouldn't bring another of your sons into this world. An abortion, Michael... it was a son, and I had it killed, but this must all end!

	Yeah, but only the rich guys. The little guys got knocked off. If they got arrested and executed, all their estate went to the Emperor. If they just went home and killed themselves, up front, nothing happened.
