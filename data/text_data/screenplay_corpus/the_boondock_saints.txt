:SC: INT. GOTHIC CHURCH 10:00 A.M. ST. PATRICK'S DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DOWNTOWN BOSTON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As we open we see the inside of an enormous church. A young looking PRIEST in his mid-thirties is finishing the delivery of the Lordâ€™s Prayer. In the back of the church, in the last pew, there are two who kneel on the cold, stone floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They do not stand to sing, nor do they offer signs of peace when told, but they pray. They grip and rub their rosaries. They mutter their words in Latin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CONNOR and MURPHY MacMANUS (mid-twenties) are shrouded in thick waist length navy P-coats, worn leather boots and the hungry clothes of the poor. The boys heads are shaved and they have facial hair.
</DIRECTION>
<MONSIGNOR>
<DIRECTION>
(dismissing young priest)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you Father Macklepenny, for coming all the way across town to be our guest speaker today. I hope you found our little parish to your liking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONSIGNOR>
<DIRECTION>
Macklepenny takes his seat on the alter along side the regular priests of the church. The MacManus brothers suddenly stand, as all others remain seated. Each church goer between them and the aisle shifts his/her position to allow the boys passage, as if on command. The two turn and begin to stride for the alter, eyes down, determined.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNABELLE_MACMANUS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (thick Irish accent)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They've never been like anyone else. From the moment they were born, of the same womb, on the same day, they just had their own way, my boys did. And I always knew that one day they would do something of true greatness. I just never expected they would bring about such a... such a reckoning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNABELLE_MACMANUS>
<DIRECTION>
The MacManus brothers are fraternal twins. As Annabelle MacManus speaks, Macklepenny is taken aback as he scans the congregation amazed to find that he is the only one who thinks this out of the ordinary.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The monsignor begins his sermon. Macklepenny rises to stop the boys from this disgraceful disturbance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The elder clergyman finds Macklepenny's arm, keeping him seated while shaking his head. Macklepenny's confusion gives way to awe as he watches the brothers step onto the altar, brush by the six seated priests, and approach the enormous crucifix.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They both fall to their knees and kiss the feet of Christ. They rise and as abruptly as they came, they turn and head back down the aisle for the front door. They stop at the rear of the church, turning to listen to the sermon.
</DIRECTION>
<MONSIGNOR>
<DIRECTION>
(loud, authoritative)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and I am reminded of this holy day of the sad story of Kitty Geneviese. This poor soul cried out time and time again for help but no person answered her calls. Though many saw, not one so much as called. Her assailant wiped the bloody knife off on her lifeless little body. They watched as he simply walked away. Nobody wanted to get involved. Nobody wanted to take a stand... We must fear evil men and deal with them accordingly but what we must truly guard against, what we must fear most
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is the indifference of good men.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONSIGNOR>
<DIRECTION>
The MacManuses turn and walk out the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. CHURCH STEPS SUNNY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boys put on their dark glasses and pause at the top of the steps to light up their cigarettes. They both roll their cigarette butts along their tongues and screw them into their lips. In this unique way they light up, seemingly oblivious to their synchronicity and mimic.
</DIRECTION>
<CONNOR>

:SC: INT. NOLAND'S MEAT PACKING PLANT 4:00 P.M. SAME DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Murphy, wearing a white blood soaked smock and apron stands around the corner of the entrance to the loading dock. He grips a gigantic, bloody slab of meat and smirks. Connor flips his cigarette out the loading dock and passes his brother's hiding place. He notices the workers have stopped, and are looking at him.
</DIRECTION>
<CONNOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONNOR>
<DIRECTION>
Murphy slaps Connor square in the face with the bloody slab.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Connor's face is caked with blood as he stands stunned. He then leaps on Murphy, sending him into a pile of nearby hamburger. He grabs a large cow tongue from a nearby heap and begins slapping Murphy in the face with it as they both laugh and the workers cheer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Their boss, McGERKIN approaches with a very large woman.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her head is clean-shaven. The two are still laughing, out of breath, they turn.

Rozengurtle and Connor stand in front of a bunch of co-workers who are cutting meat as it goes by on assembly.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know where that term comes from? In the early 1900's it was legal for men to beat their wives as long as they used a stick no wider than their thumb.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROZ>
<DIRECTION>
Connor holds up his thumb and stares at it.
</DIRECTION>
<CONNOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't do much damage with that. Perhaps, it shoulda been the rule of wrist. Ha!

<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rule of wrist.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONNOR>
<DIRECTION>
She returns an icy stare. He hands her the knife. The co- workers all seem wary of Roz.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Murphy stands on one side of Roz, Connor on the other, surrounded by a tight group of workers. Everyone is within ear shot of one another, cutting meat as it goes by. Knowing glances are shared by everyone. It is an uncomfortable mood.
</DIRECTION>
<CONNOR>
	<DIALOGUE>

Rozengurtle begins to turn, raising her fist to Murphy.

Murphy winds up and punches her square in the face. She lands on her back. The on-lookers are stunned as he walks over and stands above her.

Connor flicks his cigarette butt out the large open loading doors at the end of the hall. The red brick buildings stretch down the alley both ways. The glowing butt falls to a filthy resting place, directly next to a dented green dumpster with half the paint job scraped off.

As soon as the deafening sound pierces through the receiver, Connor instinctively jumps up to a standing position. The bag of ice bursts as it hits the floor and spreads across it. He throws the receiver and covers his ears with both hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The phone then falls to the ground, skipping through the cubes as the boys dive for it screaming. The two naked, hysterical boys fumble for the phone, flailing on their stomachs in the field of ice. They finally catch it and both put their ears to the receiver in panic. As they scream MA intermittently, the pauses get longer and longer.

:SC: EXT. AN ALLEY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAUL SMECKER, F.B.I. agent, is lead by the Boston Chief of Police through a jungle of ravenous reporters, police lines and uniformed officers. He is impeccably dressed in a deep red suit. He is smiling, confident as he walks. He is a very good-looking, slender man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks intently, for a moment, at four uniformed officers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They approach two dead bodies, laying next to a dented green dumpster with half the paint job scraped off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One man, IVAN CHECKOV, lays on his stomach, closer to the dumpster than the other. The ass of his pants has been burnt out and a large cotton bandage is in its place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The other, VLADDY, has a blood soaked bandage around his head and is on his stomach as well. There are hundreds of pieces of porcelain of various sizes everywhere. Three plain- clothed homicide detectives, DUFFY, DOLLY and GREENLY hover close to the bodies. Dolly and Duffy listen to GREENLY, an obvious rookie, give his over-confident theory of what took place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The chief is about to interrupt them, but Smecker holds him back with a smile. The two wait and watch in a position, where the unsuspecting detectives have their backs to them.
</DIRECTION>
<GREENLY>
<DIRECTION>
(thick Boston accent)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...so these guys are just kickin' the shit out of each other. This guy
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(points to Vladdy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Picks up an old kitchen sink that some one threw out and crushes this guy
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Checkov)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With it. All right, so it makes a big bang and alerts their friend, who's standin' look out around the corner. So he comes over and gets into it with this guy,
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Vladdy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's angry at him, right? They get into an altercation in which the look out guy crushes this guy by jumpin on him. And look at the damage here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Vladdy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean this guy's fuckin' hamburger man. His spine is crushed. He's all twisted and shit. That guy had to be one big mother fucker. Huge, 3-400 pounds, fuckin huge.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREENLY>
<DIRECTION>
Smecker listens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Chief is embarrassed.
</DIRECTION>
<GREELY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or, okay. Check this out. Say these two don't even know the huge guy. They're just staggerin' home from a bar this morning, still all fucked up from St. Patty's last night. So they figure they'll take a short cut down the alley and this big mother fucker, he's just waitin'. And what could be more perfect for strong arm robbery? Two drunk guys all bandaged up. They're already injured for Christ sakes. He takes a blunt object and whacks the guy with the bandage on his head, right? Cause he's smart. He knows the guy with the bandage on his ass, he ain't going nowhere. Matter of fact, this guy's probably helping his friend with the rectal problem along. They're limping around like a couple of decrepit old broads. So once this guy's out of the picture
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(denotes Vladdy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	this poor asshole, he tries to run. But look how far he gets fore the huge bastard catches up with him. Only a few yards. And what does he do? He gets creative. He picks up a sink and crushes the poor mother- fucker. Then, he ain't done yet. He comes over here, jumps on this guy's back and crushes him to death.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Vladdy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He steals their shit and beats it! Thanks for comin' out!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And look at this print...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREELY>
<DIRECTION>
Greenly points out a large foot print on Vladdy's back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Some detectives nod in agreement. Smecker chuckles as he shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<GREENLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's one big fuckin' shoe!... and think about it. Of all the ways to kill a guy, crushin' him to death. That's very particular. You don't get many of those. I dunno. I feel something big here. I wouldn't be surprised if we see more of these turning up.

	</DIALOGUE>
</SMECKER>
<GREENLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Detective Greenly. Who the fuck are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREENLY>
<DIRECTION>
Smecker saunters up to Greely and pulls his I.D. out of the breast pocket of his sport coat and lets it hang. The large, light blue letters, F.B.I. can be easily seen.
</DIRECTION>
<SMECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's who the fuck I am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SMECKER>
<DIRECTION>
All the detectives seem disgruntled and look to the Chief for an explanation.
</DIRECTION>
<CHIEF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, I gotta go by the numbers on this one. I.D. just came back on these guys. They've got connections to the Russian mob. That makes it a federal matter and Agent Smecker, here, is heading up the investigation with our full cooperation.

<SMECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sweet-n-low!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SMECKER>
<DIRECTION>
Greenly looks helplessly to the Chief, who simply nods. He storms off the scene, upset. Smecker turns his back on everyone and puts earphones in. He reaches down and hits play. The choir song "Agnus dei" overtakes. He begins to investigate. He kneels at the bodies for a moment then stares at the opposite brick wall. He picks up a piece of porcelain and scrapes it with his thumb.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He quickly cocks his head toward the sky and begins to chuckle as he says Jesus Christ, under his breath. He brushes some paraffin on each of the dead men's hands. Duffy and Dolly watch defiantly. They start to smile at one another as they collectively realize his homosexuality. He is slightly effeminate buy not overly fey.

<SMECKER>
<DIRECTION>
(to Chaffey)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look in the trash around their hands. See if you can find me two bullet casings. 45's, if my eye serves me right. Don't disturb them. Mark them as they lay. Newman, root through this shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(points to the mountain of garbage)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If this was a sink find me some metal parts. Gimme a faucet or a drain cover or something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SMECKER>
<DIRECTION>
The two begin their tasks. Chaffey finds a casing near Checkov's hand, hidden under the edge of the pile.
</DIRECTION>
<CHAFFEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Got it. It's a 45.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHAFFEY>
<DIRECTION>
The homicide detectives are surprised as Chaffey looks for the second shell. Smecker lights up a smoke.
</DIRECTION>
<SMECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chief, could you get ballistics down here and tell them they have to dig a 45 slug out of a brick wall.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SMECKER>
<DIRECTION>
He points to a bullet hole in the opposing and tattered wall.
</DIRECTION>
<SMECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and locate another that's been fired through a dumpster.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SMECKER>
<DIRECTION>
He points to another bullet hole at the dumpster's base.
</DIRECTION>
<CHIEF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got the best ballistics guy in the world. He's mobile. Got all his stuff right in the van. Can have him down here in 10 minutes.

Smecker turns to detectives with a smirk.

<SMECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You guy's ready for this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SMECKER>
<DIRECTION>
They both nod.
</DIRECTION>
<SMECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This was no gangland assassination. Though creative, it was way too sloppy. Something went wrong here. This has personal written all over it. Now, these men were crushed and the first natural reaction the body has to such trauma is to tense up. So now the two shots fired here were reflex rounds. These guys weren't shooting at anything, but they were just about to.

:SC: INT. EMERGENCY ROOM DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A potent song takes our ears as The MacManus brothers sit in the E.R. They have already received care. Their faces are beaten and there are bandages and dried blood in various spots. Connor's injuries exceed Murphy's. They are both clad in only their leather boots, boxer shorts and worn out old bathrobes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Young kids wait for medical attention, as their knife wounds bleed. Two nuns in the corner console a third, whose robes are ripped and face is beaten. A woman toward the end of the hall is so badly beaten she is unrecognizable.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the song builds to a more harrowing chorus, a man enters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His clothes suggest he's a pimp. He is not injured. He looks around as he stands, perturbed, at the end of the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches over and grabs the beat up woman by the hair and begins to drag her out. She is kicking and screaming from the floor, grabbing at his wrists as he hauls her away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(Slo-mo) The boys, instantly furious, stand and begin to go toward the action, but Connor's legs give out on him and he falls to the floor. Connor, still trying to go after the pimp, crawls towards him. Murphy helps his brother to his chair and hold him tight.

<SMECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First of all, I'd like to thank whichever one of you donut munching, barrel-assed dip-shits leaked this to the press. That's just what we need now, some sensational story in the papers making these guys out to be super heroes, triumphing over evil. And let me squash the rumors now. These two aren't heroes.

(rolls his eyes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They are two ordinary men who were put in an extraordinary situation and they just happened to come out on top. Yes, nothing from our far reaching computer system has turned up jack shit on these two. All we know is what we found out from their neighbors. And the general consensus is that they're... angels.

	But if you want to beat your head against a wall, then here's what you look for. These guys are scared like two little bunny rabbits. Anything in a uniform or flashing blue lights will spook them. So the only thing we can do is put a potato on a string and drag it through South Boston.

McGinty's's is packed to the walls with drunken Irish. A lot of faces are recognizable from Noland's Meat. Connor is in front of the bar. He and Doc are staring at each other as if waiting for one man to give in. Connor has his arms across the chests of Murphy and some friends, holding them in place. They are interested in the competition.

Everyone falls down laughing. Doc is angry and starts throwing ice at them. DAVID DELLA ROCCO makes his way through the crowd. Rocco is thirty-two years old. He has shoulder-length, dark hair and a full beard and mustache that wrap around his big smile. He charges up to the bar and yells to Doc.
</DIRECTION>
<ROCCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! Fuck! Ass! Get me a beer!

This sends everyone even further into laughter. Doc throws two huge fists full of ice at him. He backs away laughing.

The boys get up off the floor and have a huge group hug with Rocco as they all scream each others names.

They all laugh and commence drinking.

Everyone laughs heartily. Just then, three large Russians in suits enter. The obvious leader, CHECKOV, stands in front with VLADDY behind one of Checkov's shoulders, with another guy behind the other shoulder. They mean business. The laughter fades.

<CONNOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think Ma would mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONNOR>
<DIRECTION>
They clink the glasses together, throw back the Hennessey, ball up the thick glasses in their fists, drop to one knee and both deliver a devastating blow to each of Checkov's quads. Murphy on the left, Connor on the right. He's down for the count, writhing on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boy's each take a Russian guy and start fighting as the others start kicking and spitting on Checkov. This is a bar brawl, lots of punches don't connect. Connor dismantles his man quickly. Murphy is still fighting as all the Irish try to jump in and help Murphy but Connor goes into psycho mode, pushing them all back.
</DIRECTION>
<CONNOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let the boy go. He knows what the fuck he's doing!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONNOR>
<DIRECTION>
They all back off and start to cheer him on. Murphy and Vladdy are ripping each other apart. Vladdy backs him against a wall and pulls back, exhausted, for one good punch. Murphy reaches up behind his head with both hands and pulls two bottles of wine from a wall rack. He swings them toward each other with Vladdy's head as the mid-point. The bottles haphazardly connect, one on each side of his head. He crumples to the ground in an explosion of glass and wine.
</DIRECTION>

There is shock and silence.

:SC: INT. MCGINTY'S PUB NIGHT A FEW MINUTES LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They have Ivan Checkov tied down to the bar on his stomach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Connor stands with an unlit cigarette dangling from his lips next to Ivan. He pours Hennessey all over Checkov's buttocks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They all cheer. Ivan's face is battered as Rocco wakes and approaches. He punches Checkov in the face in complete rage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two friends subdue him as all chuckle.
</DIRECTION>
<CONNOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, like my fine brother says, on St. Patty's everyone's Irish. And this piece of shit is about to be initiated.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONNOR>
<DIRECTION>
As they cheer, Connor lights up his smoke and tosses the match on Ivan's butt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Hennessey is instantly ablaze and Checkov is screaming and wiggling in horror. Some just stand there stunned, but most of the remaining onlookers leap to Ivan's aid. They furiously pat him out and turn on Connor.

:SC: INT. CONNOR AND MURPHY'S APT EARLY NEXT MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Connor and Murphy, fairly beat up, sit up on their beds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They wear tattered bathrobes and boxer shorts. They put their feet down into their leather boots. The boys examine the extent of one another's injuries and reflect on their hangovers. They both laugh and grab their heads in pain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Boom! The door breaks open and in hobbles Checkov and Vladdy, guns drawn. Checkov is all beat up and the ass of his pants is burnt out. A bulky bandage covers his buttocks. Vladdy has a large bandage around his head. The boys stand in surprise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ivan smashes Connor in the forehead with his gun, sending blood gushing down his face as he falls to the floor. Murphy helplessly yells his brother's name as he is brought to his knees by Vladdy. Ivan positions Connor on his knees before the toilet, which is open to the room. Checkov puts his foot on Connor's head and proceeds, as he struggles, to hand cuff him to the old toilet. So now Connor is bleeding and hugging the commode with his hands cuffed behind the bowl base.
</DIRECTION>
<CHECKOV>
<DIRECTION>
(almost whispering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was going to kill you. But I'm not... I'm going to kill your brother. I'm going to take him down to the dumpster and I'm going to shoot him in the head. Then I'm going to throw his dead body in the garbage.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looks at this watch)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Trash guys are coming in 10 minutes, gotta go.

Checkov walks towards the door and says "let's go" to Vladdy.
</DIRECTION>
<MURPHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was just a bar fight. You guys are fuckin' pussies!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURPHY>
<DIRECTION>
Vladdy pulls him to his feet and leads him away following Checkov.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Connor, blood running from his face, listens to absolute silence for just a moment. Suddenly his face reads the gravity of the situation. In a split second he turns into an animal. He's yelling, pulling, tugging and growling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His body is a whirlwind of motion. The skin on his wrists bleeds profusely.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. ALLEY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vladdy and Checkov lead Murphy out back into the alley.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Murphy is on his knees next to the dumpster. Checkov has his gun to the boy's head. He acts like he's going to pull the trigger, but he stops. Vladdy is standing twenty feet away with his back to them keeping a look out, gun in hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. CONNOR AND MURPHY'S APT. MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Connor becomes so venomous, that he pulls the entire toilet right out of the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. TO EXT. MACMANUS' TENEMENT LOADING DOORS MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(slo-mo) Connor steps out onto the sill of the huge, open loading doors. He is five stories up. His muscles ripple with the weight of the toilet. His face is barbaric.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. ALLEY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From his kneeling position, Murphy can see his brother perched 50 feet overhead. He does not let his face betray him.
</DIRECTION>
<CHECKOV>

	I hope your conscience is clear, Irishman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHECKOV>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. MACMANUS' TENEMENT LOADING DOORS MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(slo-mo) Connor bends his knees and heaves the toilet upward and swings one arm directly beneath it. He is no longer tethered around the basin. He holds it at a cocked angle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The heavy porcelain tank cover slips off the toilet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He tosses the toilet in a left and outwardly trajectory, then he jumps off the sill to the right. He is sailing through the air about twenty feet behind, and to the right of the toilet, cuffed hands above his head, robe up like a cape behind him. Murphy screams
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. ALLEY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(slo-mo) Checkov begins to laugh heartily. The tank top lands pristinely on a garbage bag just behind Murphy. Ivan's look turns to one of terror. Bam! He is crushed by the toilet. Boom! His gun goes off, punching a hole in the dumpster near the bottom. Vladdy hears the bang and crouches as he turns to see a wave of tiny porcelain bits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Connor lands squarely on Vladdy's back. His gun discharges firing a hole in the brick of the opposing wall. He is savagely crushed against the ground. Connor bounces off and hits the wall, landing in the garbage completely unconscious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Murphy takes his hands from his head. There is dead silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He runs to his brother, pulls him from the trash and checks his vital signs. He seems okay. Vladdy, still alive, slowly crawls for his gun, inadvertently covering his own bullet casing. Murphy goes over, picks up the tank cover and clubs the man to death with two hard and fast blows, then throws it up and behind him. It lands in the dumpster with a resonating boom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Murphy quickly takes everything from the scene; guns, money, wallets, watches and a pager. He shoves it in a garbage bag and throws Connor over his shoulder and runs out of the alley.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

The police chief is standing on the front steps of the police station making a statement to the ravenous press: cameras and pushy reporters. Agent Smecker stands slightly behind him.

Rocco stands amidst the sea of reporters as the chief begins.

The press is ablaze with questions. Smecker turns and walks down the precinct steps, passing Rocco, who carries a bunch of folded clothes, and heads for the police station. Smecker glances in Rocco's direction, barely noticing the man who has already passed him.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. POLICE STATION BATHROOM NIGHT.

An officer turns on the faucet of a sink and begins to wash his hands. We go down to the pipes beneath the porcelain basin. An old leak seeps water through a crack in the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. MACMANUS' CELL NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A water leak starts on the ceiling. It drips faster and faster. The water begins to follow a water damaged crack along the ceiling. It slowly spreads in two directions.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The brothers struggle for air in their sleep. Then slowly, and at the same time, they each reach up one arm apiece and simultaneously curl their hands as if grabbing something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Their straining faces are brought from darkness to light as they sit up quickly, face to the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>

Their eyes open wide and they each draw their first breath as drops of the creeping water land on their foreheads.

The other end of the line picks up and a thick Russian accent instantly begins speaking. Connor responds by speaking a few words in Russian before he realizes it's a recorded message. He begins writing. He hangs up the phone and smiles as he lights up a cigarette.

:SC: INT. POPPA JOE YAKAVETTA'S OFFICE DAY. A.K.A. THE JOKE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rocco, still sporting a shiner, enters an office. There are papers everywhere and it is a cluttered mess of telephones, filing cabinets, lamps and chairs. Rocco clutches a brown paper bag as if it is made of gold. POPPA JOE YAKAVETTA, Rocco's boss, is on the phone. He is in his late forties.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's always comfortably dressed; sleeves rolled up, collar unbuttoned.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VINCENZO LIPAZZI swaggers across the office to Rocco. He is in his late thirties. He goes out of his way to look like Elvis; open shirt, gold chains and medallions. He is overweight and has a bouffant hairdo, accompanied by Elvis shades. Vincenzo flips a half dollar in his hand constantly.

As he speaks he unwraps the wax paper in the bag. Rocco looks over his shoulder. It's a sandwich. He's embarrassed.

Vincenzo smirks at him.

There's a long tense pause. Suddenly, Yakavetta throws his head back and roars with laughter. Vincenzo joins in. Rocco lets out a semi-audible sign of relief and gradually starts laughing himself.

:SC: INT. SMECKER'S BEDROOM NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul Smecker lies in bed with his young lover, Reuben (mid- twenties). He has an innocent, feminine look and a GQ air about him. The two have just had sex and Reuben is far more excited about it than Smecker.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reuben pants and gestures that it was a wonderful experience.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smecker watches TV.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reuben reaches over and affectionately places a hand on Smecker's chest. Paul tosses it off with indifference.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reuben has a pouty look. The phone rings.
</DIRECTION>
<SMECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh,huh.

<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Room number.

<DIRECTION>
Reuben throws an arm over Smecker's abdomen and places his head on Paul's bare chest as if to now force affection.
</DIRECTION>
<SMECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We got a time of death?
	</DIALOGUE>

He is visibly miffed with Reuben's sudden display. He tries to pull the arm away but Reuben holds tight.

<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the body count?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SMECKER>
<DIRECTION>
Smecker is annoyed. He slaps Reuben semi-gently once on his exposed cheek. Reuben closes his eyes and holds even tighter.
</DIRECTION>
<SMECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, huh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SMECKER>
<DIRECTION>
He bites his lower lip in anger and smack Reuben again on the same cheek, hard. Reuben jumps to a sitting position holding his cheek. He is shocked and hurt.
</DIRECTION>
<SMECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be down there in a bit. Keep the press out.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smecker saunters down the hall, his usual confident smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is impeccably dressed in a brightly colored suit. Greenly stands directly outside an open door at the hall's end. A steady flow of detectives and forensics filter in and out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smecker halts before Greenly and looks straight into his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<SMECKER>
<DIRECTION>
(intrigued)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's struck again, hasn't he, Greenly?
	</DIALOGUE>

<GREENLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you always disrespect me like that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREENLY>
<SMECKER>

	</DIALOGUE>
</SMECKER>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. PLAZA HOTEL SUITE LIVING ROOM NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smecker and Greenly walk into a large sunken living room with high ceilings. There is a huge white shaped pit couch in the center with seven dead bodies draped across it. All the bodies have been turned so they are either seated or on their backs and bright new pennies have been place in their eyes. There is one corpse directly in the middle of the living room, making eight. This victim (THE FAT MAN) is overweight and is lying in debris made up of sheet rock and broken wood which spreads thinly for a five foot radius around him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The victims' body positions are in a circle with the fat man as the hub. Smecker is instantly engulfed. The regular homicide detectives are on hand with their I.D.s hanging out of their breast pockets. They see Smecker and back off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Duffy wears an especially loud tie. Smecker lights up a smoke. He circles around and sees another body behind the couch, which makes nine. The victim is on his back, with pennies stuck in his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<SMECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How many bodies, Greenly?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SMECKER>
<GREENLY>
<DIRECTION>

Smecker's eyes widen as he turns to Greenly.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! Shit! I didn't see that one. Nine! Nine!
	</DIALOGUE>

Smecker takes a beat. He addresses the detectives.

	The fat man.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent.

Smecker tosses the Idiot glance to Dolly.
</DIRECTION>
<SMECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Symbology? Well, now that Duffy has relinquished his King Bone Head crown I see we have an heir to the throne. I'm sure the word you were looking for was symbolism. What's the symbolism there? Let me explain it to you. In Greek and Roman mythology when you died you would have to pay the toll to Charon, the boatman who ferried you across to the gates of judgment. This made sure the dead came to atone for what they did during their lives, Detective...

:SC: INT. PLAZA HOTEL SUITE LIVING ROOM NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smecker is chain smoking. His clothes appear unkempt. His eyes show emotion at every new found clue. The detectives watch closely. He is hunched over the body of the fat man probing his wounds with his gloved fingers. Greenly has re- entered. He defiantly holds a cup of coffee but is too intimidated to interrupt Smecker. He sets it down and folds his arms.
</DIRECTION>
<SMECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've seen burns like these before. They used silencers. Look at these entry and exit wounds. They're identical.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SMECKER>

He stands up and gives a lesson to the now eager detectives.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He points his two index fingers to the back of his own skull.
</DIRECTION>
<SMECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The two bullets went in here, through the top of the skull, criss-crossed and exited through the eyeballs. This one clue tells us three distinct facts. Number one... Duffy.

<DUFFY>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</SMECKER>
<DIRECTION>
Greenly and Duffy want to know how.
</DIRECTION>
<SMECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now stay with me, boys. What did they do to make two such identical wounds? Did one guy put him on his knees, pop a cap in, sit him back up and shoot him again the same way? No. Two men of similar height dropped this guy down, each put some iron to his head and boom! That's all she fuckin' wrote!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SMECKER>
<DUFFY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about one guy with two guns?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUFFY>
<SMECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Possible, but unlikely. The angles are too extreme. A guy holding two guns to the back of your head is gonna shoot straight ahead. He wouldn't cock out his elbows, makes no sense. Besides, you telling me one guy came in here and killed eight men with eight extremely well aimed shots in just a few seconds? No way. Had to be at least two.

We either have rank amateurs that got lucky or consummate professionals that fucked up.

They go over and grab seats at the bar. Smecker mixes himself a gin and tonic on the other side. He is calming down now and going back into cool mode. He starts to tuck his clothes back in and fix his hair. He leans over the bar and sips his drink. The three detectives lean in.
</DIRECTION>
<SMECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With the exception of my coffee boy, you Boston detectives are starting to show signs of intelligence. So, I am going to make you privy to some information that you would not normally be. These men are all Russian mob. Not like those two peons in the alley the other day. These guys are all syndicate bosses and underbosses. I have a dossier on every man in this room. Since the Iron Curtain has gone down, the Russian syndicates have started to come here. And in the spirit of Glasnost the Soviets have opened their borders to the mafia. But the Italians, they're not convinced that the grounds in mother Russia are fertile enough for organized crime yet. So they ain't ready to commit. The Russians are coming here anyway. They are unwelcome. What we have here, gentlemen, is possibly the beginning of the first international mob war... unless I've totally missed something.

	And is there an American, shit is there a man seated among us that hasn't thought about it many times, let's just put them all on an island, give them guns and let them kill each other.

Rocco comes out of the bathroom. He storms out to his small, round, living room table at which the boys are seated. He is wearing a white, polyester shirt with gold trim that is a uniform of some kind for perhaps a chain of restaurants. It is unbuttoned all the way down and his white t-shirt is hanging out. He is wearing a name tag that reads "Jaffar".

He is upset. He slams down a chair across from the brothers who are sitting there cleaning guns and silencers. All the accouterments of death are sprawled before them. They are smoking as they carefully disassemble their firearms.

The door opens. As the men exit the elevator, each face is seen individually, all are victims from Smecker's crime scene.
</DIRECTION>

The elevator goes up half a floor. They hit the stop button and rummage in their bags. They suit up; black gloves and black masks. They strap on four 9mm. pistols with silencers, in shoulder holsters, one under each arm. Connor takes a large coil of black rope and drapes it around himself. He looks at Murphy and at the rope in his bag. Murphy is too excited to argue.

:SC: INT. PLAZA HOTEL SUITE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The plump boss is standing in the middle of the sunken living room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His eight Russian comrades are around him seated on the U- shaped pit couch. They speak Russian, but no subtitles are seen. The fat man yells. He's mad about something.
</DIRECTION>

Connor is taking lots of random turns, left and right. He is starting to look a bit confused.

The fat man is really yelling at them now. He is screaming and pointing at each man.

They seem to be taking it seriously.

:SC: INT. PLAZA HOTEL AIR SHAFT NIGHT

	</DIALOGUE>
</MURPHY>
<DIRECTION>
The boys get into a close quarters battle. An occasional insult is thrown as feet kick and fists fly. They begin to get tangled in their own rope. The seam of the duct breaks and a tangled mess of rope and MacManuses pour out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. PLAZA HOTEL SUITE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They crash through the ceiling right above the fat man's head. The rope gets caught and slams the boys to a halt, hanging them upside down, back to back about six feet above the floor. They are turning in circles. The boss is balled up in the fetal position on the floor. The shocked Russians say only a word or two in panic before the MacManus brothers react, reaching for their guns. The Russians start to reach for their guns. It's too late. The boys draw and fire as they spin. Taking four shots apiece.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There are eight dead Russians. Chests explode as they fall back on the couch in a loose circle. One victims is blasted over the couch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They notice the fat man directly beneath them. Murphy grabs his Rambo knife, reaches up and cuts the rope. They land in
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
a heap, scramble over to the doomed man and place him on his knees. They each put a gun to the back of his head and recite this prayer in perfect unison.
</DIRECTION>
<BOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And shepherds we shall be. For thee, my Lord, for thee. Power hath descended forth from thy hand that our feet may swiftly carry out thy command. So we shall flow a river forth to thee and teeming with souls shall it ever be. E nomini patri, et Fili e spiritu sancti.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOTH>
<DIRECTION>
With the silenced pop from their guns we cut the sound and go to black and white. (Slo-mo) Choral music starts with Latin script being read in the background. They take their rosaries out. They slowly walk around, mumbling prayers as they care for the dead. They gently turn over the bodies that were on their stomachs. They brush the hair back from the victims faces. They place pennies in the eyes of al the corpses. When they finish their ritual, they pull off their masks and look at each other. They start to grin and look around. They work each other into a healthy chuckle.
</DIRECTION>
<CONNOR>
<DIRECTION>

Just then, there's a knock at the door. They snap into action. They stand at each side of the double doors, looking through the peepholes. They see Rocco on the other side dressed as a hotel employee. He wears a polyester shirt with gold trim and a name tag that reads Jaffar. He has a good cart in front of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They look at each other and grin. Murphy nods. As they open the door, Murphy grabs the food cart and pulls it in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Connor seizes the mortified Rocco and pulls him in, slamming the door shut behind him. They run, dragging him and then throw him in the midst of the bodies. They put their guns right in his face.

Murphy jokingly slaps Rocco a second time. Rocco instantly jumps on Murphy, cursing and punching. The brothers burst into laughter as they subdue Rocco. As he calms down, they release him.

The three are partying hard. There's a pizza surrounded by Guinness cans as they whoop it up, sitting at the round table.

Rocco wears one of the masks. They're all drunk. The house cat is lounging on the table comfortably.

Rocco slams his fist down on the table next to Murphy's gun.
</DIRECTION>

The gun goes off with a bang! and blows the lounging cat right off the table. A softball-sized hole is blasted in the wall as a large splatter of blood sprays the area surrounding the hole. Everyone is in shock for a second.

Smecker hits an orange button on the wall and a black steel door with a money slot comes slamming down in front of the first booth. He does the same thing to the last booth, leaving the middle one open. Both doors possess peep holes.

	Allow me to enlighten you gentlemen to the protocol of the porno industry, as I'm sure you've never been in one of these places before. A man goes into the booth, puts the money in the slot.

	Those doors were down... which means this. They looked down in through the peep hole, saw these guys and opened the doors from the inside. Pop, pop, pop, right through the glass. Why?

	Maybe the three of them had something in common.

	Then that's what they had in common. They were all bad guys... now they're all dead bad guys.

Smecker seems side-tracked and ponderous at Greenly's observation. He hits the orange buttons and raises the doors.
</DIRECTION>
<SMECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We got another thing to think about here. We got us a genuine Kennedy assassination style bullet theory. Two guns were used here, guns A and B. The guy in the middle was done with both. But this guy...

	...he was killed with bullets from gun A only. And this guy...

Smecker points to two bullet holes in the wall of the booth on the left. Each is marked "B". He walks over to the right booth where in the exact location are two identical holes marked "A".

Smecker storms from the room. The detectives begin to follow.

Smecker comes barreling back in, shoving them out of the way. He looks at the bullet holes in the walls marked "A and B" again. Something has clicked.

Smecker flashes them a photo of a dead body. The victim is shot in the head and face down in his plate of food. His hands are on the table in front of him.
</DIRECTION>
<SMECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These guys were packing. Not one hand near a gun. It's simple human behavior. Someone you don't know approaches you, you put your hand on it. This guy's got his hands on the table. He's eating his food, for Christ sakes. They were friends.

Smecker looks over the bar.
</DIRECTION>
<SMECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These two fucking scenes are related. Too many coincidences. Same day? Five hours apart? Dead mobsters on both scenes. Now, why did he kill the bartender?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SMECKER>
<DUFFY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Crime of passion. He just went nuts. He would have shot everyone in here. He just ran out of bullets.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUFFY>
<SMECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Duffy. This look like a fucking post office to you? This guy came in here with intent. Maybe he didn't know exactly what he was gonna do but he had a pretty good idea. The bartender wasn't a fucking accident.

	Well, we didn't get any help on that. A lot of people saw it. Nobody's talking.

<SMECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fucking figures. Look, are you guys seeing the pattern here? We got big questions at both of these crime scenes, with no answers. WHY did they kill the guys in the other two booths? WHY did he do the bartender? It would seem unnecessary, even stupid.

Just then two more bills come through the slots of the other two doors, which have remained closed. Murphy looks through left peep hole, Connor the right. Smiles spread across their faces and they look at each other. They switch and each looks through the other guy's peep hole.

Rocco gets serious and nods his head. Connor replaces the clip in his gun and hands it to Rocco. Murphy does the same.

He stands with one in each hand, aiming one gun at each door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boys both place a finger on the appropriate orange buttons, as Rocco slowly cocks his head back. With wide eyes he thrusts his head forward. The doors fly up. Rocco fires both guns yelling "Yeah, take it, take it!" Both the drug dealer from outside and the pimp from the emergency room are destroyed. Rocco then crosses his arms and fires two more shots from each gun. On the opposing walls of each booth two identical bullet holes appear.

The door behind Rocco begins to open outward. As the door swings open, Rocco tries to angle a gun around to shoot the man who is opening it. But as soon as the man sees his hand, bam! he comes down on it with the towel rack. Rocco pulls back in pain dropping his other gun but the gun fires, as the man's blow connects.

Murphy is aching to help but Connor is more steady. A man who has been shot starts to regain consciousness. Connor turns his back to shoot him (slo-mo). Murphy sees his opportunity, pulls the cue ball from the table, and rolls it silently across the carpet toward Rocco.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Connor fires with his left hand and as the casing ejects from the gun he catches it in mid air and makes the sign of the cross. Rocco is on his back, the man is straddling him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They both have each others throats and are trying to strangle one another. When the ball is within arms reach, Rocco slams his hand down on it and knocks his assailant in the skull.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He straddles him and begins to mercilessly beat his face in with the cue ball, yelling "You sick fuck!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He finally stops, gets up, runs toward the boys, and throws an exhausted punch at Connor who just lays Roc down on the pool table and says, "Nicely done, boy". Murphy tends to Roc. Connor checks out the man and seems surprised.

Murphy takes the bloody cue ball from Rocco's hand and polishes it off on his jacket, making sure Connor cannot see. He replaces it perfectly on the table. Smecker now stands in front of the table with the cue shining in the background.

<DIRECTION>
Smecker exits to the left as Greenly enters from the right, following Smecker out. He walks by the table furiously scribbling in his notebook. Connor, Murphy and Rocco exit the room, pennies in the eyes of all the corpses in the background. Rocco holds two duffle bags full of poker money.
</DIRECTION>

Greenly stops, picks up the cue ball and looks at the dead man. He shakes his head and says, "Nah".

<DIRECTION>
Smecker stands in the middle of the front lawn. His hair is a mess. He's chain-smoking. His clothes are disheveled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes are psychotic. He points to the parked Taurus as six men in dark suits appear in a fuzzy, out-of-focus shot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They line up shoulder to shoulder on the sidewalk.
</DIRECTION>
<SMECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>

:SC: EXT. SUBURBANK "BEAVER CLEAVER" TYPE HOUSE SIDEWALK DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(Slo-mo) Two black leather boots slowly walk up the sidewalk and stop in front of the new, gray Ford Taurus then turn toward the house. Il Duce removes a white balloon filled with a few ounces of fluid from the pocket of his black trench coat. He throws it on the walk, the blood splatters. He picks up the remnants of the balloon and puts them back in his pocket and stands there waiting, looking at the house.

The boys come out, Rocco in the middle and slightly ahead of them. They look out to the walk, stunned.
</DIRECTION>
<SMECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now they are staring at six guys with guns drawn. It was a fucking ambush.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SMECKER>
<DIRECTION>
Our three heroes stand, their jaws dropping as their point of view reveals the Il Duce, standing alone, his hands folded in front of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, he throws open his trench coat to reveal a special leather vest beneath. Six guns, all different, are holstered on the front of it: three on each side extend from just below his collar bones to his abdomen. Connor and Murphy don't hesitate. They each draw one of their now unsilenced guns from their shoulder holsters and aim, one arm over each of Rocco's shoulders. The Duke draws his top two weapons and aims.
</DIRECTION>
<SMECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And this was a fucking bomb dropping in Beaver Cleaverville! For a few seconds this place was Armageddon! There was a fire fight!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SMECKER>
<DIRECTION>
They all start shooting at once. The noise is deafening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Taurus is being pierced and the front of the house is splintering as it is riddled with bullets. Smecker is still in the middle, hands raised to the heavens, turning circles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rocco's pinky finger gets shot off, sending blood splattering against the house. He dives in the bushes reeling. He pulls a gun and starts firing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Murphy catches a bullet in the arm and dives for the bushes as well. Il Duce with lightening speed, drops the guns and pulls the next two down as he walks to his right about ten feet. He commences firing and the casings hit the sidewalk, all different calibers and sizes are dropping down the walk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's him and Connor and nobody is backing down. They both grind their teeth as they fire rapidly at each other. At the same moment, The Duke gets hit in the arm and Connor takes a bullet in the leg. The firing ceases for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Connor remains steady and Il Duce looks down at his arm and his own blood splattered on the sidewalk.
</DIRECTION>
<IL_DUCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!... No! No!...
	</DIALOGUE>
</IL_DUCE>
<DIRECTION>
He drops the guns and pulls the last two as he moves to the right. He fires with wrath as he screams the word No over and over. Rocco and Murphy return fire from the bushes yelling and swearing, as Connor does the same from his position on the stoop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Duke turns and runs, leaving a sea of casings, and guns that extend for 35 feet down the walk. There are also two blood stains.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a frenzy the boys and Rocco get up and withdraw some spray bottles from their bags. The begin spraying all their own blood stains on the stoop and the front of the white house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They then pick up their things and run off.

</SMECKER>
<DIRECTION>
He backs against the building and slides down to a sitting position in the bushes as if he has given up. He raises his head and there he sees Rocco's pinky finger lying undiscovered in the bushes. He pulls a small plastic bag from his pocket and scoops it up. He shoves it back into his pocket and races off.

Smecker goes in the booth on the far left. Rocco tries the door, it's locked. A middle-aged PRIEST slips a key in the priests booth and opens the door. Rocco shoves him in and goes in behind him.

Connor gets the slider open. Rocco's long hair hangs just inches from Connor's face. Connor puts his thumb and forefinger through, desperately reaching for a lock of Rocco's hair. Rocco jostles the priest and puts the gun hard to his head.

Just then Connor snags a piece of Rocco's hair and pulls him back hard and fast by it, until his head slams into the lattice work. Rocco grabs the priest back into position.

Connor grabs a nice wad of Rocco's hair with his left hand, so that the side of Rocco's face is now pressed to the lattice. Connor then puts a gun to Rocco's head.

Murphy has scootched his chair in front of Connor's. He has his back to Connor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stretches his neck over and bites at the collar of his p- coat. He gathers as much of the material in his mouth as he can. He starts to yell, "Do it!" but it is muffled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Connor, still sobbing, begins to kick his brother's left hand repeatedly. He turns it into a bloody piece of broken meat as Murphy screams through the shirt. Finally, it is
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
broken enough and Murphy pulls it through the cuff.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stands and breaks the chair into pieces and grabs the sharpest piece. Hojo enters and Murphy shoves the sharp stick up through the bottom of his chin into his head. He drags him around the room yelling mumbo jumbo into his face as Connor jumps up and down in his chair in rage, wanting a piece of the action.
</DIRECTION>

Murphy throws the man down and Connor proceeds to viciously kick his dead body. The two have turned into barbarians.

He takes Smecker into a small bathroom adjoining the foyer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are instantly in the throws of passion. They grope each other and Smecker cleverly avoids any contact with his crotch. Smecker lies down on the floor and starts to wiggle and seductively touch himself. Geno stands over him, straddling Smecker's hips as he undoes his pants. Suddenly, Smecker grabs both of Geno's ankles and has him locked in position. He repeatedly kicks Geno in the balls from his lying position on the floor. The guy falls on his back unconscious. Smecker uses a silencer, shoots him in the head.

He starts to whisper, "It's on now. It's on now. Too far." as he walks down the hall, striding in his high heels, wig back in place. He thoughtlessly blows Chappy away as he passes his position and runs down a long hallway. He turns a corner and points his gun at the Mafioso cohort but pauses.

He is already sitting with his throat cut. Smecker looks puzzled as Il Duce withdraws from the shadows behind him.

Connor and Murphy are on their knees in front of Rocco, whom they have sat back up in the chair. They are gently placing pennies in his eye and sobbing as they begin to recite the prayer. As they speak, Il Duce watches. He then begins to whisper the prayer right along with them. Their words match up perfectly. He leans against the wall, holsters his guns, and withdraws a cigarette.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He rolls it along his tongue and twists it into his lips.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boys are still reciting as he strikes a match. They react instantly. Still kneeling they each point a nickel-plated 45 toward The Duke. They turn in time to see the light from the match illuminate his face. Il Duce pauses then he strides into the room and proceeds to recite the last half of the prayer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stops between the kneeling boys and finishes off the prayer. The boys are stunned as they realize this is their father. He makes the sign of the cross over Rocco. Then he looks down to the upturned faces of his sons. He places a hand on each of their cheeks.
