Finished reading, Lt. RICHARD BRICE passes the message on to Lt. PAUL LOOMIS. If this were today, we might intro these two 30- year-olds playing beach volleyball or working the Nasdaq exchange. But it's not today, it's 60 years ago, so instead we find them conning 310 feet of Balao-class submarine (the V.S.S. Manta), riding surface across an inky ocean, just trying to get home to Connecticut.

<DIRECTION>
INTERCUT Claire and Odell with...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brice and Schillings. Now in quick escalating moves:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Someone brandishes the chains.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Schillings sits up quickly, getting his feet under him. He doesn't know if they're about to chain him -- or beat him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brice shows his pistol.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Schillings' reaches for the blade left by Claire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brice levels the pistol.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Schillings' hand. Hovering over the blade.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brice's face: "Don't."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Schillings' eyes. Darting. Panicking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We're BACK ON Claire and Odell for the GUNSHOT. They flinch together.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONTROL ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As heads spin to the SOUND.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FORWARD CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The men part as Brice exits the stateroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Claire breaks from Odell and starts for the cabin. Brice slams a hand against the opposite wall, blocking her. She sees the back- splash of blood on his shirt sleeve. His pistol sleeve.
</DIRECTION>
<BRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should have told me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRICE>
<CLAIRE>
<DIRECTION>
(overwhelmed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe I was worried that...that you would do exactly what you did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAIRE>
<BRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should have told me no matter what, because your little secret nearly cost every man here his life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRICE>
<CLAIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But he had no reason to --
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAIRE>
<BRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Odell, the woman is confined to quarters for the duration of patrol. If she asks to use the toilet, you are to bring her a bucket. Stumbo, secure the body.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRICE>
<STUMBO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuckin' A-1, sir.

</STUMBO>
<BRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Loomis, conn is yours. I'll be in my berth -- sleeping.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRICE>
<DIRECTION>
He leaves. Stumbo cobra-spits in the general direction of...
</DIRECTION>
<CLAIRE>
<DIRECTION>
(forceless, still
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	trying to
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
explain)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just wanted to save one...just one of my patients....
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAIRE>
<DIRECTION>
She searches faces for a hint of understanding. Odell is the only one who will even meet her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SKIPPER'S STATEROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind drawn curtains, Brice removes his bloody shirt, puts it in a laundry sack. Unlaces his shoes. Finds more blood on his hands, washes it off. Lies back on the bunk. Clicks off a light. Blows a long sigh and finally, finally closes his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK_SINATRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"I'll be seeing you..."

<DIRECTION>
INT. OFFICERS' WARDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE on the phonograph. Spinning away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brice stares -- then snatches the record off the turn-table and smashes it. He smashes every goddamn record he can find.
</DIRECTION>
<BRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So who's screwing with me? Huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRICE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FORWARD CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

<DIRECTION>
Stepping out:
</DIRECTION>
<BRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	WHICH ONE OF YOU IS DOING THIS NOW?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRICE>
<DIRECTION>
It echoes the length of the boat. Only the WHALES ANSWER. But this time their cries are different -- sounding somehow less animal than before. More human.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MANTA - UNDERWATER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Manta plows on through the murk. There are no whales. Just the submarine. Alone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FORWARD TORPEDO ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stumbo finishes mummy-wrapping Schillings' body in canvas. Seeped blood shows the fatal wound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Deeper in the room we find Brice, Loomis, Coors. The three lieutenants have retreated to the forward end of the boat for a discreet talk. Odell enters and joins.
</DIRECTION>
<LOOMIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How're those hydrogen levels?

Odell nods and waits for the discreet talk to continue, assuming he's welcome. Instead...
</DIRECTION>
<BRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something else?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRICE>
<ODELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, just.... I can't believe it's one of our own hands doing this. Seven weeks, I think I know most the guys now. Just don't believe it's one of them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ODELL>
<BRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Been a rough patrol -- men do strange things under duress. Want you to keep your eyes open, Odell. Could be anyone.

Odell withdraws to the doorway.

INT. IRON LUNG - FLASHBACK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We're in a metal cylinder. But where? Is this the inside of a torpedo tube? As we adjust to the dim light, we find ourselves looking at the frail body of a 10-year-old girl. A hand comes up to try and scratch her nose...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But the hand bumps into a bulkhead. Blocked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHILD'S ROOM - FLASHBACK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the other side of the bulkhead, the 10-YEAR-OLD GIRL screws up her nose in lieu of scratching it. It doesn't help.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER TO reveal a child's room, dolls and other timeless playthings in evidence. Completely out of place here is an iron- lung machine -- hulking, ugly, loathsome -- a coffin for the not- yet-dead. Baffles rise and fall, GASPING in sync with the girl's own RASPY BREATHING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unable to sleep, the girl searches the mirror mounted above her face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HER POV: Of a half-open door behind her. A light is on in the outer hallway. O.S. VOICES. Is it morning yet? Is it time to get out now?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The silhouette of an adult -- HER MOTHER, maybe -- enters and speaks from the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<LABORED_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You shouldn't be here....
	</DIALOGUE>
</LABORED_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CLAIRE'S STATEROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Claire wakes -- and finds herself breathing badly. It takes her a moment to normalize her breath, to remember where she is. Now, twenty years late, Claire scratches her nose.
</DIRECTION>
<LABORED_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should get off when you can....
	</DIALOGUE>
</LABORED_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
"Wasn't that voice in my dream?" Claire peers at the bunk below. There's someone there.
</DIRECTION>
<LABORED_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get off before it's too late....
	</DIALOGUE>
</LABORED_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches for the light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONTROL ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SCREAM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FORWARD CORRIDOR/CLAIRE'S STATEROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brice lopes forward. Others have beaten him here, including Odell and Kingsley. Brice pushes through to see...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Schillings back in his bunk, face exposed, petrified mouth open.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought he...spoke to me.

<KINGSLEY>

</CLAIRE>
<KINGSLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Claire.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KINGSLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Claire takes another look -- and sees things differently now in full light. Schillings is clearly dead. Her fright giving way to anger, Claire looks back at...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stumbo and Hoag. Hiding their grins.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAIRE>
<DIRECTION>
(going after them)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this what you do for sport? You have nothing better to do in the midst of a war than to play sick little jokes with --

Odell wedges between.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Wrap it back up, Stumpie. We'll dump him when we surface.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRICE>
<CLAIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A bit more respect for the dead might be in order, Mr. Brice. From everyone aboard this ship.

	This is a "boat" you're a guest on, not a "ship."

(with labored voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Get off before it's too late...."

</HOAG>
<DIRECTION>
Stumbo mock-screams in imitation of Claire. We understand that Hoag was the ventriloquist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONNING TOWER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hoisted up into the tower, the corpse gets dumped behind the second-string sound man, SONAR #2.

<SONAR_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll thank him when I see him.

<DIRECTION>
Getting a whiff, he clicks on a fan. Hoag starts below. Stumbo starts adding chains to the corpse's ankles in anticipation of a sea-burial.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CLAIRE'S STATEROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kingsley limps in with two coffees.
</DIRECTION>
<KINGSLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Since no one seems able to sleep anyway... try some of this motor oil they call "coffee"....
	</DIALOGUE>
</KINGSLEY>
<DIRECTION>
He finds Claire reclined ungainly, her head craned back so as to open her breathing passage. She's having difficulties.
</DIRECTION>
<KINGSLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Claire?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KINGSLEY>
<CLAIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Changing, isn't it? The air.

</KINGSLEY>
<CLAIRE>
<DIRECTION>
(indicating her chest)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Comes and goes. Polio-myelitis, growing up. Didn't breathe well when I slept, so every night -- eight months running -- they stuck me in an iron lung.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAIRE>
<DIRECTION>
Kingsley winces, seeing the irony of being stuck aboard a submarine now.
</DIRECTION>
<KINGSLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I saw you down in the respirator ward, of course, working with all the patients, but I never knew....
	</DIALOGUE>

	Was so wretched that I swore I'd help other people through it, someday, if I could....
	</DIALOGUE>

(eyeing the curved hull around her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe it's just all this metal...this "boat" of theirs. Something not right about it...sealed off...living below the real world....
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAIRE>
<KINGSLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're scarcely the people to complain, Claire. Especially after what with Schillings -- which you know I thought was a mistake.

INT. CONNING TOWER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stumbo is hooking weights to the corpse. Soon he notices...
</DIRECTION>

The pool of blood expanding on the canvas. Is it possible? Do dead bodies still bleed like this? Stumbo tries to shrug it off and get back to work. He tries.
</DIRECTION>
<HOARSE_WHISPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So much dark....
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOARSE_WHISPER>
<DIRECTION>
The voice was like a rusty hinge. Stumbo shoots a look down the hatch, but Hoag is long gone. That means the voice must've come from...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sonar #2, the only other person here.
</DIRECTION>
<STUMBO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice try. Hoag tell you? He musta toldja.

Stumbo spins to face the corpse. "No fucking way." He eases his ear to the canvas-wrapped head.

	What if...you know...what if it's "him"?

Officers and blue shirts file past on their way to stations. When the forward section of the boat has thinned out, Kingsley hobbles into the corridor -- followed by Claire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Claire walks the hall, breathing deep, stretching her legs, testing her leash. All cabins here have name-plates that list quartered officers. But at Brice's cabin, Claire notices...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No name-plate. Just the ghost-image of one that used to be here.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Claire eases open the curtain to see...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bunk, chair, clothes locker, fold-down desk, stand-up photo of Brice and his wife. And a book on the desk. The "PATROL LOG."

<DIRECTION>
A thinking beat. Claire signals "one-minute" to Kingsley, then slips...

The water hits their chins. They bite down on mouth-pieces.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. MANTA - UNDERWATER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A deck-hatch opens. One by one, the four men drift out into near- perfect dark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coors sparks up an underwater torch. It flares to life, revealing...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An explosion of stingrays. Flapping madly, they scramble away from the light -- but not before they scared the bile out of us.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VERY WIDE: Leading with the torch, the men crawl head-first down the side of the sub. In the distance, DEPTH CHARGES EXPLODE, backlighting the entire bulk of the sub. The divers are miniscule by comparison, mere pilot-fish on a whale's back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MANTA FLOOD-PORTS - UNDERWATER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They arrive below. The sub's flood-ports are here, open to the sea, and the first three men squeeze through. For a moment, Odell is alone outside the sub. And in that moment...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A presence wells up behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Odell spins. What was that? Just another ray? His lantern probes black water. Nothing now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It grabs his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Odell nearly coughs up his mouth-piece, but...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's only Weird Wally. Hanging upside-down through the port, he gives Odell a goggle-eyed look. "Comin' or not?"
</DIRECTION>

INT. MAIN BALLAST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(NOTE: A submarine has two hulls -- the pressure hulls on the inside, a sea hull on the outside. We're between the hulls now. It's a place few people, even submariners, have ever seen.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Surfacing, the men beam lights around to behold...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A curving cathedral of steelwork. The tank is maybe 10 feet wide by 20 feet tall by who-knows-how long. Oil and kelp bob on the surface of the water. Dead squid dangle from struts and braces. Lots of them.

Splitting up, Coors and Odell slosh one way, Stumbo and Weird Wally the other. Anxious to get this over with, Stumbo heads out fast. CAMERA LAGS BEHIND with Weird Wally.

Brice sits. He stares at one particular book on his shelf for a troubled beat before pulling it down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's the patrol log.

<DIRECTION>
INT. FORWARD CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Passing, Claire notices a light on in the skipper's cabin. She lays an eye on the curtain-crack to see...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brice. He runs a Kurtz-like hand over his skull as he ponders that blank page of the patrol log: Portrait of a man who feels the hounds of Hell gaining on him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SPLIT SEAM - MAIN BALLAST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ballast tank finally dead-ends. Here Stumbo and Weird Wally find...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A split seam. FUEL OIL GURGLES through.

<DIRECTION>
Stumbo breaks out wooden wedges. Weird Wally uses a mallet to TAP A MORSE MESSAGE on the outer hull for...

<DIRECTION>
SOMETHING SPLASHES nearby. Odell jumps and beams his light on...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A squid's head in the water, one big eye watching him. Did it just fall?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coors studies the back of Odell's head. As he does, we DROP DOWN to study the steel mallet in Coors' hand.
</DIRECTION>

Odell turns back.

Drenched in oil, Stumbo drives wooden wedges into the split. Weird Wally provides light. Soon SLOSHING FOOTSTEPS turn them both around to see...

Absolutely nothing.

INT. WATER FALL - MAIN BALLAST

Coors and Odell reach the after terminus and a fall of water. They point lights up but can't see the source.
</DIRECTION>
<COORS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stern tank, looks likes.

Getting ready to climb, he belts his hammer, slips off fins.

	<DIALOGUE>
	So anything I say stays here? This side of the hull?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off Odell's nod)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There were survivors from the sinking. Brice and Loomis even started to fish a few out. But Winters had other ideas -- he ordered Brice to bring a gunnery party topside. Well, three of us had a problem with machine-gunning these men right in the water -- even if they were Germans. There was an argument. Got kinda heated.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COORS>
<DIRECTION>
Coors starts climbing a cat's cradle of girders. The steel is covered with algae, making the footing difficult.
</DIRECTION>
<ODELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why didn't you tell us?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ODELL>
<COORS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guess we were trying to protect him, his memory. Felt Winters was a good C.O. -- even if he could be a tough sonuvabitch, sometimes. For his reputation...his family's sake....
	</DIALOGUE>
</COORS>
<DIRECTION>
Coors finds another seam-split. Water fans from this one.
</DIRECTION>
<ODELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. But I still don't understand how he hit his head.

</ODELL>
<COORS>

	Slippery metal...bad footing....

</COORS>
<DIRECTION>
Coors takes the steel mallet out. He looks back down at...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Odell way below. Hard to tell if he's buying it: He's just sweeping his light around now -- and not looking up. It'd be so easy....
</DIRECTION>
<COORS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Accidents happen, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COORS>
<DIRECTION>
Right beside Coors, something moves in the fan of water. Coors jars and looks again. Nothing now. And just when he decides his nerves are acting up...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A forms extrudes through the water. A face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coors recoils.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hammer drops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Odell looks up as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The falling hammer smashes into him and his lantern. Everything goes dark. INTERCUT ALL THIS WITH:

QUICK FLASHBACKS: Of Winters. His head striking the deck. Falling overboard. Hitting the water face-first.

They all move aft now, senses racing, ducking girders and pushing through squid entrails -- before realizing: Those aren't squid entrails. They lift their lights to find...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coors. He's draped over a girder above them. When he fell, he must've impacted so hard that he vomited one of his lungs. It dangles from his dead mouth like an embryonic sac.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They gape. "Is this shit even possible?"
</DIRECTION>
<ODELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get him down....
	</DIALOGUE>
</ODELL>
<DIRECTION>
SLOSHING FOOTSTEPS. They whirl to see...

Something retreating into shadow. A human form? Is there someone else in here?

Stumbo takes off like a cannon shot.
</DIRECTION>
<ODELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help me get him down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ODELL>

Weird Wally spurts after Stumbo. For one moment Odell is left alone with a dead Coors...the dangling lung...and the Thing In The Shadows before...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He dives away, following the other two.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MANTA FLOOD-PORTS - UNDERWATER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With adrenal speed, Stumbo and Weird Wally shoot out the bottom of the sub. Odell appears a beat behind. Just as he's about to clear...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Something catches his foot. Maybe his fin is simply caught on a barb, but Odell doesn't bother to investigate: He kicks right out of his fin and keeps swimming.

	<DIALOGUE>
	...Coors. Where's Coors?
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
The three men just stare back through goggles, sucking on mouth- pieces, too amped up to respond. Soon we grow aware of RANDOM TAPPING SOUNDS.

Claire pushes through the crowd to check on Odell. He indicates "I'll live." But Stumbo is still breathing like a plow horse. Claire tries to take his pulse but gets slapped away hard: It's like she touched a burn victim.

The bulkhead DOOR CLUNKS SHUT behind her. Brice's face fills the porthole.

Soon their sweeping lights find...

The first body in the galley. A steward.

They find a second body. Then a third and a fourth. Maybe a half-dozen casualties here, some playing cribbage even in death.

Claire checks one of the steaming bodies. The flash-fire passed through here so fast that it didn't burn -- it seared, it suffocated. And bizarrely, it preserved.

The three reach the next bulkhead door, the one leading to crew quarters. It's open -- and that gives a sick-in-gut feeling. Again, Loomis CLANKS METAL futilely. They step on through...

A roll of Lifesavers still clutched in a smoldering hand...

Stepping over the few men who escaped their bunks, Odell and Claire continue on.

Lagging behind, Loomis catches movement out of the corner of his vision. He whips a light on...

A sooty mirror. The light reveals his own veiled form. Under other circumstances, Loomis might laugh at himself. But now he notices that...

Blue light strobes dangerously from an unseen source. Suspecting the worst, Odell starts clearing charred bodies from the hatch area of the battery room. As he does...

INT. CREW QUARTERS/CREW MESS

Claire and Odell. Stumbling their way back, light-beams slashing over steaming corpses, falling and getting back up, disoriented in the dark, finally reaching the last bulkhead door and wrestling with the lever until...

He's testing the sooty mirror: The strange time-delay is gone now. Just to reassure himself, Loomis reaches out to wipe the mirror clean.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MAN-IN-THE-MIRROR POV: We're inside the mirror looking out at Loomis as he clears a swath. Suddenly his mouth gashes open. Horror stretches his face.

Winters is staring back at him.

INT. CONTROL ROOM

Brice beams a light through the doorway just as...

Loomis erupts into the control room, bowling Brice over.

<DIRECTION>
Loomis ducks into the forward torpedo room. Just as Brice gets there...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The DOOR WHUMPS SHUT in his face. The lever locks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brice, Stumbo, Weird Wally grapple with the door, SHOUTING, SWEARING, fighting to undog it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FORWARD TORPEDO ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens. The last six -- Brice, Stumbo, Weird Wally, Odell, Kingsley, and Claire -- funnel inside to find...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Loomis gone. There's absolutely no sign of him except for...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His yo-yo. It swings like a pendulum right below the closed escape trunk. The other end is inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brice checks a water-level gauge. It's topping out.

<DIRECTION>
Stumbo looks at the Momsem lung he still holds. Loomis'.

KA-THUNK! An unseen hatch opens somewhere on the boat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MANTA - UNDERWATER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With CAMERA behind the bridge, we see Loomis rise up out of the escape hatch -- without a lung. He tries swimming for the surface, but that lasts only as long as his one breath of air. The forward momentum of the boat brings him closer...closer...and by the time he snags on the mangled periscopes right in front of us, he's more dead than alive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There Loomis flutters, a new flag for the Manta.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FORWARD TORPEDO ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone is rooted in shock -- until the boat jolts and the torpedo room tilts to starboard. It brings an O.S. THUMPING AND BANGING. What now?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FORWARD CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone back-tracks to find...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clothes, books, photographs -- all of Brice's stuff littering the corridor. Was it thrown here when the boat jolted?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BED COILS STRAIN behind the closed curtain of Brice's cabin. A DISEMBODIED SIGH follows. If we didn't know better, we'd swear someone just went down for a much-needed nap. Brice doesn't seem eager to do it, so Odell reaches out with quaking hand to draw back the curtain. And just as we get a sliver-glimpse inside...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lights shut down in the forward section. The entire boat has gone dark. And all anyone sees now is...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The glistening of terrified eyeballs.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. MANTA - UNDERWATER - DAY

(NOTE: The remainder of interior scenes will be lit by just gauge lights and battle-lanterns.)

Odell and Weird Wally are trying to free the air-ballast controls. They pull on a lever from above while Stumbo, on his back, muscles the linkage from below. Claire and Kingsley shed light.

If a submarine can SHUDDER, that's what the Manta does now, listing a few more degrees starboard.

</DIRECTION>
<ODELL>
<DIRECTION>
(off-balance)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just, uh, reporting that we haven't been able to repair the electrical. Heating's down, too. Ballast levers are inoperable, probably jammed during the depth-charging, Stumbo's working on it now. We show 90 pounds of compressed air left in the 600- pound system, and I'm wondering if we should save that for when we try and surface -- or use it now to breathe.

Still no answer. We get an itchy feeling this is one of those he- looks-alive-but-he's-really-dead moments. Odell reaches out to touched Weird Wally...

And he jumps in his chair.

Odell and Claire jump in their skins.

Weird Wally removes headphones that he's using as earmuffs. His chest bristles with amulets and totems, his tiny office is adangle with charms and talismans. All that's missing is the "Voodooville" sign.

Darkness.

Alone, Claire steps into the corridor set at a drunken angle. She takes a hit of air from her lung -- and that's it, no more. Now she just listens. Soon a WET, METHODIC BREATHING becomes audible. It's the kind of sound a submarine might make on its own -- but it's also the sound a drowning victim might make if he returned from the dead. Claire flicks off her lantern and aims it ahead at...

The skipper's cabin. Is "he" asleep?

Steeling herself, Claire approaches...

INT. SKIPPER'S STATEROOM - CONTINUOUS

...and eases the curtain open. The BREATHING IS LOUDER here. Her light checks the bunk. Empty. "Well, what did I expect?" The light flits to the desk -- and finds the patrol log.

Claire moves inside and opens the log. There it is again -- the cross. Apparently it means something to Brice, too. Claire finds his latest entry and reads.

The bunk. Motionless. But the bedcovers have moved. Haven't they?

After a small forever, the other BREATHING RESUMES. Claire takes the patrol log and backs out of the room.

INT. OFFICERS' WARDROOM

<DIRECTION>
RAPID-FIRE SHOTS of Claire's hands opening two books, rifling through page after page of ship silhouettes. Her fingers tremble from cold and fright, but they manage to tear out two pages.

Behind the drawn curtain of the wardroom, Claire overlays the two pages and puts a light behind them. The two silhouettes line up almost perfectly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her mind reels.

Now we see the books she's torn from: One is the "AXIS IDENTIFICATION LOG." The other, "ALLIED IDENTIFICATION LOG."

Claire makes a move to leave but...

The BUNK SQUEAKS across the corridor. HEAVY FEET hit the floor.

Nap time's over.

Now she hears a CURTAIN OPENING and FOOTSTEPS THUMPING out. The fabric of Claire's curtain ripples as something passes on the other side. Then it's gone. Just as Claire's heart starts up again, the FOOTSTEPS DOUBLE BACK to her.

CLOSE on the curtain-rings. Starting to move.

Suddenly standing in a world of golden rain, Claire laughs and cries and loses her footing. Odell catches her before she hits the deck -- and sees no reason to let go.
