This story takes place during a World Series between the Mets and the A's. Canseco plays for Oakland, and Strawberry is still with New York.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAY ONE:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GAME THREE: LT WINS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT: EARLY MORNING - LT'S HOME - QUEENS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This typical QUEENS HOUSE is sandwiched between other neighboring, nearly identical HOUSES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MORNING SOUNDS Of FAMILY BICKERING, LAWN MOWERS, and SHOUTED GOOD-BYES are heard coming from many HOUSES on this close-knit block. A NEW BABY can be heard BAWLING inside LT'S HOUSE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LT, hurried and harried, stumbles out his FRONT DOOR. He heads for his CAR, parked askew in the DRIVEWAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LT is some 40 years old. His natural swagger makes up for his lack of conventional good looks. He is obviously hung- over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LT squints, pained by the SUN. He fumbles with his SHADES, puts them on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LT's TWIN EIGHT YEAR-OLD SONS trundle out the FRONT DOOR of the HOUSE, bickering as they run to catch up with their Daddy. The hefty TWINS wear ill-fitting PAROCHIAL SCHOOL UNIFORMS. Their oversize PAROCHIAL SCHOOL BRIEFCASES threaten to trip them up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LT's WIFE, BABE in arms, comes out to watch LT's lovely SEVEN YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER head off toward her school on foot. Many other members of LT's EXTENDED FAMILY hang out on the STOOP and the LAWN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the TWINS cross the LAWN, the bickering turns physical. They start whacking each other with the BRIEFCASES. The TWINS pile into LT'S CAR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT: MORNING - LT'S CAR - EN ROUTE TO/AT PAROCHIAL SCHOOL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAR is obviously LT's home away from home. FOOD DEBRIS, BEER CANS, VODKA BOTTLES and other garbage litter the interior.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An impressive HAND-GUN is visible between the seats.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An old ICON of MOTHER MARY rides on the DASHBOARD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the TWINS get in, LT tries to hide the GUN and the illicit detritus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
To little avail. The TWINS pay no mind to his machinations; they have evidently seen it all before.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As LT drives the TWINS to SCHOOL, the three play wild rough- house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAR swerves crazily.
</DIRECTION>
<LT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How many times are you gonna miss the bus? Huh? All the other kids can get up in the morning, but you guys wanna be driven around like the fucking President. I'm your goddamn chauffeur!

<TWINS>

(each taking alternate, overlapping lines)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit, man. It wasn't our fault! -- You think Sis is so perfect, well, if she hadn't hogged the fucking bathroom, maybe we -- I thought Aunt Lu was dead! She was in there so long...

</TWINS>
<LT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up! Listen!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LT>
<DIRECTION>
ON RADIO: Chatter about Mets winning last night's game. It was the THIRD GAME straight that they've won so far. One more game -- set for tomorrow afternoon -- and the Mets will sweep the World Series. All listen.

<TWIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're gonna win the Series in four!

<TWINS>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Strawberry!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TWINS>
<DIRECTION>
The TWINS whoop and shout, celebrating LT's -- and their own -- favorite player.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They pass the PAROCHIAL SCHOOL BUS. It has stopped for a moment taking on KIDS. LT cuts off the TWINS' tirade.
</DIRECTION>
<LT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit, man -- there's your fucking bus I oughtta make you late! Make the nuns whack the shit outa ya both.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LT>
<DIRECTION>
LT and the TWINS banter back and forth, poke each other and box around. The apparent hostility of their words is balanced by the laughter and gung-ho play of the rough-housing. The TWINS yell cat-calls as they drive past a BLONDE PEDESTRIAN. LT joins in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - Through the WINDSHIELD, the PAROCHIAL SCHOOL comes into view. A CROWD of UNIFORMED KIDS is gathered outside. SEVERAL NUNS turn the CROWD into two neat rows, and usher the KIDS inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV LT - THE NUNS
</DIRECTION>
<LT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get going.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LT>
<DIRECTION>
The TWINS get out. Join the line of students entering the SCHOOL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The instant the KIDS have left the CAR -- LT takes out some COKE. Snorts it. He takes his GUN out of hiding.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LT steers with his knees as he drives off toward the City.

EXT: AFTERNOON - QUEENS - CRIME SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - A CAR WINDSHIELD. Blood-spattered and shot up. The DEAD BODIES of TWO GIRLS are in the front seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LT gets out of his CAR and makes his way through the COPS and GAWKERS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The BET COP comes up to LT.
</DIRECTION>
<BET_COP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two Black kids came up out of nowhere and shot those chicks. Then they laughed as they walked away. The Press is gonna call it the "Giggling Man Murders." I'll tell ya. What a world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BET_COP>
<DIRECTION>
LT gives a cursory glance to the crime scene. A couple of COPS greet him; LT keeps walking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The BET COP digs his attitude.
</DIRECTION>
<BET_COP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But hey -- we make the best of it, man, don't we? Huh? How about them Mets!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BET_COP>
<DIRECTION>
FOLLOW LT - over to a GROUP of COPS. They greet him and everyone immediately crams into a parked CAR. The CAR stays parked for the duration of their meeting.

INT: AFTERNOON - UNMARKED COP CAR (PARKED) - QUEENS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now that LT, the BET COP and the OTHER COPS are inside the CAR, they can do business. LT pays several COPS their WINNINGS for last night's game. CASH and congratulatory banter is exchanged.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now LT has to take their BETS for tomorrow afternoon's GAME, the FOURTH GAME of the World Series. LT urges the COPS to bet against the Mets.
</DIRECTION>
<LT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No fucking way they're gonna do it in four games straight.

</LT>
<COP_ONE>

	I know that nigger like he's my brother. He ain't gonna let us off so easy. He'll make us sweat first. This game's going to Oakland. Not a doubt in my mind, man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LT>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. The COPS think about it for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BET COP speaks up first; hands LT some CASH. When he talks to LT, his fawning posture is obvious.
</DIRECTION>
<BET_COP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm in. Here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BET_COP>
<DIRECTION>
COP ONE SHRUGS his assent, gives CASH to LT. The OTHER COPS follow his example, place their BETS on OAKLAND.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The COP BETS total $800 -- on OAKLAND. LT has obviously been the bookie for this precinct for a long time. He takes care of a lot of action and has these guy's faith.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LT nods a goodbye, quickly gets out of the CAR. The BET COP and the OTHER COPS remain inside.

CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT: AFTERNOON - PAY PHONE - MIDTOWN - 38TH STREET & 3RD AVENUE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LT pulls up alone beside a PHONE BOOTH and phones in the COPS' bets and his own to LITE. More than an anonymous connection to the BOOKIE, LITE is obviously LT's old friend -- and a hustler just like himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LT shouts into the PHONE and holds it close to his ear. The TRAFFIC NOISE is loud and irritating.
</DIRECTION>
<LT>
<DIRECTION>
(into the phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got them all going for Oakland. With bullshit money. We'll cover the $800.

ACROSS THE STREET - TWO GUYS approach a BUSINESSMAN in a raincoat and flash a KNIFE. The BUSINESSMAN gives up his WALLET and his WATCH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LT pays no mind to the robbery.
</DIRECTION>
<LT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, man. Don't give me that bullshit. Don't pussy-out on me. The Mets are a fucking lock. I wanna make some money.

</LITE>
<LT>

	Yeah. I'm sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LT>
<DIRECTION>
LT hangs up the PHONE, heads back toward his parked CAR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
By this time, the BUSINESSMAN is running into the street, waving his arms and screaming.

EXT: EVENING - CRACK CITY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LT arrives, leading a BUST. Lots of COPS. LT chases a handsome young COKE DEALER, JC, cornering him a couple flights up a staircase. Now they're alone and the phony pantomime is over.
</DIRECTION>
<LT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, man, gimme something cooked!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LT>
<DIRECTION>
JC gives it to him with a PIPE. LT takes a drag of CRACK. Then LT gives JC a large BAG of COKE, labelled "Exhibit A".
</DIRECTION>
<LT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's good shit. From when they busted those Columbians uptown. You can cut it in half.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LT>
<DIRECTION>
JC nods, bemused by LT's manic behavior. JC, in contrast, is mellow and in control. LT smokes; JC doesn't.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LT COUGHS and SMOKES as he shouts to COPS downstairs (OFF).
</DIRECTION>
<LT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got this guy. But there's someone across the street on the roof!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LT>
<DIRECTION>
The COPS (OFF) rush out of the building.

JC watches LT smoking like a fiend.

<JC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That stuff'll kill you quick, man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JC>
<LT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the fuck are you? A drug counselor or a drug dealer? And you don't even do your own product! What kind of businessman are you?

	See you in a coupla days. Have the cash ready.

INT: NIGHT - ARIANE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Religious/hip artifacts abound. It's a nice, if messy apartment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
However, it is definitely not large enough to merit the $3,500 that ARIANE quotes as her rent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ARIANE is LT's mistress.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOWTAY, her girlfriend, lounges on the COUCH. BOWTAY plays the third when LT is in the mood for a menage a trois. She's around a lot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOWTAY is already zonked out on something. Maybe LUDES.
</DIRECTION>
<ARIANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Got something good for us?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARIANE>
<DIRECTION>
LT gives her the COKE. ARIANE takes some immediately. BOWTAY sloppily partakes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Before LT can even sit down, the GIRLS start bitching.
</DIRECTION>
<ARIANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm gonna need some bread, man. This ain't fair. I'm always here for you, and you can't even take decent care of me. My landlord is bitching like a motherfucker! You're two months behind on the rent, Lieutenant!

</ARIANE>
<LT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didya ever think of moving to a cheaper apartment? $3,500 a month is crazy, man!

	It's nothing. This is New York, man...

	Oh -- I forgot. Bowtay needs some cash to buy her new acting headshots out of the developers. It's a good investment, man. She could make serious money!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARIANE>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - BOWTAY on the COUCH. It's obvious that she's going nowhere. And fast.
</DIRECTION>
<ARIANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've been rehearsing a new monologue. From Shad's Saint Joan, you know? Bowtay does it wonderfully well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARIANE>
<DIRECTION>
LT breaks out more COKE and some GRASS.
</DIRECTION>
<LT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, Bowtay. Show us your stuff.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LT>
<DIRECTION>
ARIANE lifts BOWTAY to her feet. BOWTAY staggers into the center of the room, then falls back down on her knees. It happens to be appropriate for the scene.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOWTAY begins to recite the monologue from the very end of the play. "When will the world be ready to receive thy saints?", etc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOWTAY messes up a line; ARIANE lashes her with a BELT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOWTAY doesn't move, continues reciting. ARIANE joins in from time to time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LT is turned on.
</DIRECTION>

He begins KISSING ARIANE, then goes down onto the floor.

The KITCHEN is very bachelorette. No FOOD or COOKING IMPLEMENTS in sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LT is messing around, looking for something to DRINK. He opens the REFRIGERATOR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV LT - CU - The REFRIGERATOR is entirely empty, save for a few suspect and peculiar items. There is nothing in liquid form.

LT hears ARIANE calling to him from the LIVING ROOM.

LT approaches the market where he intends to buy the DIET COKES.

A display of FRESH FRUITS & VEGETABLES extends onto the sidewalk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LT notices a SQUAD CAR, parked in front of the MARKET. LT picks up his pace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Closer now, LT sees a YOUNG UNIFORMED COP outside, standing with the KOREAN OWNER, an elderly man who doesn't speak much English. The OWNER is agitated and out of breath. He argues fiercely with TWO YOUNG BLACK KIDS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SQUAD CAR is parked in front of the MARKET.

LT gets an idea. He takes command.

The UNIFORMED COP is a timid rookie.

	Uh, Lieutenant, Sir -- The owner says they stole cash from the register. He was chasing them down the block when I caught up with them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP>
<DIRECTION>
The KOREAN OWNER is still agitated. He tries to give his side of the story, mixing English and Korean. At the same time --
</DIRECTION>

The TWO BLACK KIDS plead their case. They try to drown out the OWNER. It all gets rather noisy.

LT is now alone with the KOREAN OWNER and the TWO YOUNG BLACK KIDS.

LT whips out his GUN and shoots a deafening BLAST between the TWO KIDS' heads.It almost takes off the left ear of one and the right ear of the other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The TWO YOUNG BLACK KIDS are stunned. Speechless.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The YOUNG UNIFORMED COP rushes out of the MARKET, GUN raised in one hand, BEER CAN in the other. He's relieved that a cop wasn't shot, but the whole situation makes him uneasy.
</DIRECTION>

LT grabs the BEER, points to the KOREAN OWNER.

LT swaggers around the store, GUN in hand, drinking the BEER, assessing the inventory with a proprietary air. He pretends to SHOOT at various products. Plays around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the back aisle, LT aims his GUN at a BIG BOX of TOILET PAPER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
While he holds the TOILET PAPER at bay, a THIRTEEN YEAR-OLD KOREAN KID rises up from behind it, his hands up, terrified.

He puts them down, takes a BEER for himself. ARIANE doesn't turn around. She's busy preparing drugs.

A PILE of BROWN HEROIN on a TIN FOIL SHEET. ARIANE is preparing the implements for "chasing the dragon."

BOWTAY rolls over, sprawls on the floor in an even sexier position.

On her face, an expression of utter bliss.

ARIANE helps LT with the thin, TIN FOIL PIPE. She burns the SMACK on the TIN FOIL SHEET for him so that he can manage to inhale the PLUME OF SMOKE in time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He gets a nice, deep hit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ARIANE gracefully takes a hit of her own.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are both very high, already. Beginning to NOD OUT.

<DIRECTION>
ARIANE goes back to the IMPLEMENTS and prepares another hit.

This time she catches the SMOKE in a SHERRY GOBLET and LT drinks it.

LT is very high now. A meditative, hallucinatory state.

LT has overslept, out cold on the COUCH. A LITTLE GIRL sits on the floor, two feet from the TV, watching CARTOONS. Various other members of LT's over-extended FAMILY can be seen moving around the house, going about their business.

A CARTOON EXPLOSION wakes LT. He jumps up in a panic.

DOORS SLAM (OFF). The TWINS have come home from school.

They burst into the LIVING ROOM, loud as Hell. Furious about something they out-curse each other.

CU - A YOUNG BLACK DEALER, eyes open, shot dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LT drives up, sizes up the scene. It's fresh territory. He'll milk it for what it's worth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LT ignores his colleagues, the COPS ON THE SCENE. He knows some of the DEALERS and STREET CHARACTERS on the sidelines.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He heads straight for them.

LT greets an impressively beautiful, six foot tall TRANSVESTITE. He takes her aside.

LT slips a HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL into VERONICA'S well-filled BRA.

</LT>
<DIRECTION>
LT saunters up to the MURDER CAR, DEAD WILLIE still in the front seat. LT is obviously berserk to get the KI, but he can't show it. LT susses out the situation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Around him, POLICE TECHNICIAN-TYPES are busy lifting fingerprints and analyzing the CAR and WILLIE -- to no apparent avail.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LT uses his Lieutenants' privilege to enter the MURDER CAR and begin his own investigation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIRE TRACKS are discovered nearby. The OTHER COPS are distracted.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LT takes his shot. He reaches for and finds the KI of COCAINE under the BACK SEAT. LT slips it under his COAT and emerges from the MURDER CAR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Outside the MURDER CAR, LT makes to stand up. In the act, he -- DROPS the BAG of COKE!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LT is stunned. He can't believe the KI is actually in the shitty, gutter water, in plain view of the other COPS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The COPS spot the KILO of COKE. Even those COPS that were far away, somehow know what has happened. They quickly gather round the MURDER CAR, LT, and the KI.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The PLASTIC BAG filled with WHITE POWDER floats on the DEEP PUDDLE.

LT is silent wrath incarnate.

</SERGEANT>
<DIRECTION>
The other COPS ignore the query.

LT has successfully covered himself, but he walks off cursing and mumbling.

VERONICA is laughing demonstratively in the background.

LT is further away now from the scene of WILLIE'S murder and his own debacle. LT overhears something. Cuts off his muttering.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A group of COPS are talking about the big news from the early morning.
</DIRECTION>
<COP_A>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I still can't fucking believe they'd rape a nun, man...

LT stops in his tracks. The erotic import of this conversation has seized LT's imagination. He heads toward the cluster of COPS, cuts in.

	What's this shit about a nun getting raped?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LT>

EXT: NIGHT - A CITY HOSPITAL PARKING LOT

<DIRECTION>
LT pulls up. Parks near a group of OTHER COPS, waiting by their CARS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HOSPITAL fauna passes by in the background: DOCTORS, NURSES, PATIENTS in all stages of recovery or relapse. The HOSPITAL itself rises in the background. It looks like a prison.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LT leaves his CAR, heads for the GROUP of COPS. He joins them, sits down on the HOOD of a nearby CAR. The COPS are all DRINKING heavily.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Present are the BET COP, and several other FAMILIAR COPS from previous scenes.

LT watches quietly, taking it all in. As if following the motto: "He who defines himself, confines himself."

	What did they want with the Host?

COPS avoid each others' eyes. Competition has begun. No one shares information, each after the reward for himself.

LT bursts out, swings into high gear.

	Leave it to the Catholic Church, man. Girls get raped everyday, and now they're gonna pay 50 G just because these chicks wore penguin suits!

LT comes down off the CAR HOOD. Now he has to feign pride in his supposed big bet on OAKLAND.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LT has to convince the COPS to keep betting -- he can't afford to pay them all off. Unfortunately, the COPS all think LT just scored big, himself.

</BET_COP>

LT nods "yes." An outright lie.
</DIRECTION>
<LT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Sure. Don't you get it? The series has gotta last seven games. The last two did, didn't they? It's a racket. Do you have any idea how much money they make selling television-time for commercials during the series? Especially if it's a New York team? They won't close the gold mine after only four games. It'll last a full seven. Too many people wanna milk it for what it's worth. You'll see!

<BET_COP>

SEVERAL COPS, including some of the COPS who have been hanging out in front of the HOSPITAL, go double or nothing on OAKLAND. LT takes their BET MONEY -- $900.

One COP doesn't go along with the deal. LT painfully pays him off.

	You'll be sorry, man. But if you wanna be a sissy, here's your bread.

INT: LATE NIGHT - CORRIDORS OF A CITY HOSPITAL - HUNTING FOR THE NUN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The HOSPITAL is an inferno. LT exploits his cop privileges; shows his BADGE to the GUARDS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He wants to get into the inner sanctum. Beyond where even COPS were allowed to go. He wants to get to the NUN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sexy NURSE stops him.
</DIRECTION>
<NURSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I help you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NURSE>
<DIRECTION>
LT can't help but check her out and flirt.
</DIRECTION>
<LT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm in charge of the investigation. Just checking security.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LT>
<NURSE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Security?

</NURSE>
<LT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you want those guys coming back? For the nun? Or for you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LT>
<DIRECTION>
The NURSE looks at him, unsure, then walks off down the CORRIDOR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LT continues his hunt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He comes upon a DOOR that is plastered with "QUARANTINE" SIGNS. One too many, perhaps. LT senses the NUN is inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He has to open the DOOR, but hopes he won't get a blast of disease in his face. He CROSSES himself -- wearing a smirk, but nonetheless. Going on instinct, LT opens the door a crack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's right. It's the NUN. He positions himself outside the DOOR, keeping it open a few inches. He peeks inside without being seen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT: LATE NIGHT - THE NUN'S HOSPITAL EXAMINING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From just outside the door, LT peep-toms on the NUN while she is being examined. He sees her stark naked, laid out on a table, her legs spread wide apart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The DOCTORS, NURSES, COUNSELORS work on the NUN as if they are automatons. They don't grasp either the humanity or the trotitism of the scene. LT does. The image of The Alabaster Nun turns him on no end. Yet there is also a deeper pathos to the scene.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And the NUN is spectacularly beautiful. She doesn't speak. Looks like a Pieta.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A DOCTOR in a WHITE-COAT reads the MEDICAL REPORT to a FEMALE COP. The FEMALE COP writes down the details on a hard-backed pad. As if it's a parking ticket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The moving contrast between the words and the image seems to be apparent to LT -- and the NUN -- alone.
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(to Female Cop)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They inserted a crucifix eleven centimeters into her vaginal aperture, breaking the hymen membrane. Then they pursued the same course with their natural organs of sexual penetration. They used a sharp object, probably a hunting knife with a curved blade, to carve a cross between her shoulder blades, entering the flesh an average of nearly one centimeter throughout the area of the wound. They --

Finally, as if she knew he was there all along, the NUN looks up at where LT is hiding and boldly meets his eyes.

INT: VERY LATE NIGHT - ARIANE'S APARTMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LT has been there for some time. They are alone. They've both been DRINKING and COKING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LT is carrying on about the NUN. As he speaks about various subjects, his tone changes radically. From contempt and cynicism to profound reverence. From decadence -- to awe. ARIANE, too, manages to switch from one attitude to the other.
</DIRECTION>
<LT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you ever seen a naked nun? I tell you, man, I went to school with the nuns, I've seen hundreds since then and I've never even seen a nun's belly button, you understand? But this nun, let me tell you. What a beautiful lady...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(snaps out of his awe)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And where'd the Church get the 50 G in the first place? The fucking Church is the biggest scam going. You know what's the real killer? It costs $8,000 per kid for them to go to parochial school. I've got three kids in there already, with two on the way! Christ. That fucking reward is my money, man! But that's Church policy. The Pope is the world's biggest bookie. Makes people bet on their own salvation! Double or nothing on Heaven. You go to Hell -- then go to Hell. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was bullshit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LT>

ARIANE can't stop thinking about the rape.

	I can't get over what those guys did to her. I just can't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARIANE>
<LT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're alive, aren't they? Come on, man! Everyone's making such a fucking fuss, just because she's a nun. Just because she wears a penguin suit, the church puts up 50 G for the guys who dared to rape her. Do you think they'd put up a dime if you got raped? Of course not. Or even for your little sister? The virgin? Like shit they would.

</ARIANE>
<LT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah? At least she's alive! I see people get killed every day! Worse yet, tortured first and then killed! The nuns got off easy. Jeez. Cigarette burns. Everyone's all upset about fucking cigarette burns. I'll show you cigarette burns!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LT>
<DIRECTION>
LT stubs out his CIGARETTE on the back of his hand. He does the move with intensity and bravado.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ARIANE responds by calmly doing the same. But she does it entirely impassively, and rubs the CIGARETTE into her flesh longer than LT did.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ARIANE comes over to LT and starts kissing and licking his CHEST.
</DIRECTION>
<ARIANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you believe in God? Do you believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God?.

LT hesitates.

ARIANE kneels down in front of LT. As if in prayer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She starts giving him head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Before he can answer The Question, he is saved by the bell. The PHONE RINGS. LT picks up immediately. It's LITE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As LT speaks to LITE, ARIANE continues to give him head.
</DIRECTION>
<LT>
<DIRECTION>
(to LITE; over the phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I know, I know all about it. Enough already about the fucking nuns. Yeah. Yeah. So just take the bet. Don't give me any hassles, man. Just put in my bet. 30 G's. Yeah. And I got $900 from the cops on Oakland. Yeah. Right. Strawberry's gonna knock em dead. Of course he is! You know that! Yeah. Yeah. Have faith, man! OK. Right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LT>
<DIRECTION>
LT hangs up, thinks ARIANE won't resurface the God Question.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ARIANE does, even as she gives him head. Every time she speaks, she pulls away and it frustrates him. This dialectic continues throughout the scene.
</DIRECTION>
<ARIANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you believe in God?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARIANE>
<DIRECTION>
LT thinks about it, even as ARIANE gets him hotter and hotter.
</DIRECTION>
<LT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Church is a fucking racket. I know how they operate. I've been part of the racket since the first time some faggot priest spilt water on my head. My Aunt Lu says I was crying all the way through. Yeah, I know their game inside out. Now I'm free of it and I'm gonna stay that way.

LT can't respond. He's distracted by his own pleasure.

ARIANE does something OC that causes LT sudden pain.

POV LT - A CAR with only one TAILLIGHT. A Cyclops in the darkness. Under a STREETLIGHT, JERSEY PLATES are visible. So are the two inebriated, leather-clad GIRLS inside. LT pulls them over.

LT comes on to them. He's way out there. The GIRLS are smashed.

LT drives up erratically and parks his CAR in front of the CHURCH/CONVENT.

LT stumbles into the CHURCH. Alone now, he notes various aspects of the DESECRATION, but can't see much because he's blind drunk.

The enormous, graphically bloody CRUCIFIX confronts him.

He collapses immediately into a PEW. Sleeps.

<DIRECTION>
LT wakes up. Ruckus all around him. The COPS are there in force -- including some of the guys from the BAR, the UPTOWN MURDER and the HOSPITAL PARKING LOT. They are privately checking out the Scene of the Crime, looking for leads that will give them an advantage. Everyone wants the TWO NUNS to talk. The NUNS are in a circle of interrogators. At first, LT can't even see them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ELDERLY NUN was attacked but not raped. They carved crosses on her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the background, the questioning has already begun. The interrogators become increasingly frustrated. It can be heard in their voices. They want the reward, and -- despite a certain constipated "respect" in their attitude -- the COPS are willing to browbeat the NUNS to get it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LT silently bums a COFFEE off a COP and staggers into the ring.

LT hangs back in the crowd, staring at the YOUNG NUN as the COPS interrogate both NUNS.

LT, on the sidelines, turns to an OLDER COP. LT mutters his commentary

The ELDERLY NUN lowers her head. Shamed.

POV LT - The YOUNG NUN smiles a quiet, intractable smile.
</DIRECTION>

COP 2 is screaming mad, but tries to hide it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LT has observed their interaction. Though he would have loved to have heard some information from the YOUNG NUN, her defiance gives him even more pleasure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MONSIGNOR comes forward to "translate" the NUNS' stubborn silence. He is possessed by a conventional sort of ambition -- this is his big chance. He would like to be Cardinal some day, but never will be. He enjoys the spotlight as he pontificates.
</DIRECTION>
<MONSIGNOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen. One nun is nearly 80 years old. I'm not from this Church, of course, but I assume they'll be getting her a new pair of glasses. Apparently she's legally blind without them. The Sister who suffered a rape is just 17. She arrived from Ireland only a couple of months ago. This -- event -- is just too much for them to take!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONSIGNOR>
<DIRECTION>
The MONSIGNOR clears his throat demonstratively, takes a dicitous tone.
</DIRECTION>
<MONSIGNOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen. The Church would like to know who did it just as much as the NYPD. These arrant criminals broke the laws of man, and the laws of God. The Church wants nothing more than to see them behind bars. That's why we're offering the $50,000 reward to whomever brings them in. I'm sure our hero will be one of New York's Finest.

The YOUNG NUN shoots the MONSIGNOR an offended look.

It appears for a moment as if the YOUNG NUN makes eye contact with LT. But he can't be sure.

GAME FIVE is close, and features STRAWBERRY. As LT listens, he reacts physically to the changing status of the game.

He drives crazy through the streets, pounds the ceiling.

He's so COKED, he's bouncing out of his skin. LT drinks VODKA out of a PINT BOTTLE in his COAT.

Remembers his own past.

INT: AFTERNOON — THE CHURCH/CONVENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The interior of the CHURCH/CONVENT is still desecrated. In stark contrast to the "White Church" (above, Scene 22).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POLICE ROPES have cordoned off certain desecrated areas of the CHURCH. In other places, MOPS and SLOPPY BUCKETS of SHIT- WATER wait for someone to finish cleaning up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LT appears to be entirely alone in the CHURCH. He is desperate for clues. He searches for leads and perhaps, for something else...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CU - He lights a CANDLE, gives a QUARTER --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then LT lights his CRACKPIPE ever the FLAME.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the NUN appears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LT hides, watches as the NUN enters the CONFESSIONAL Once she is ensconced inside, LT stealthly approaches the CONFESSIONAL and from right outside -- a tantalizing proximity -- he listens as she confesses to the PRIEST. (This is an elderly PRIEST with a striking, unusual voice. Not the MONSIGNOR from the COPS' interrogation of the NUNS. Scene 20.)
</DIRECTION>
<NUN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forgive me Father, for I have sinned. It has been two days since my last confession. Father, my sin is a terrible sin. A sin of omission. There was another sin that happened at the same time, and in the same place, but my sin I think was graver stil.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NUN>
<PRIEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sister, we all know what happened to you yesterday morning. I expected that you would want to speak to me about it. But you could have come to my office. Your being here, in the confessional, implies that you, Sister, have done something wrong. You haven't. I assure you. I feared you might have misplaced feelings of guilt. If you condemn yourself because you experienced feelings of... curiosity or even... pleasure, you mustn't --
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRIEST>
<DIRECTION>
The NUN LAUGHS. At first, it sounds like crying. But it is a strange, low laughter.
</DIRECTION>
<NUN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Father, if it was so trivial, so natural, so -- No. I have sinned. And you must listen if you are to prescribe an appropriate act of contrition, and to absolve me. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your arms to serve God?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NUN>
<PRIEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's funny, you knew. But the first thing I think of is kneading the bread that I help bake for the soup kitchen. Maybe that's because my the muscles in my arms still hurt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRIEST>
<NUN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I also thought of that bread, Father. And of that night six days ago when the Mother Superior died, and I kept the cool, damp cloth on her forehead freshly moist. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your legs to serve God?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NUN>
<PRIEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think of running for help, and falling to my knees in prayer.

	As I have prayed day and night since the desecration of this church yesterday morning -- and my sin. You see, Father --

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Sister?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRIEST>
<NUN>

Outside the CONFESSIONAL, LT stiffens. This could be the clue he needs to solve the case.
</DIRECTION>
<NUN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could tell you their names now, and I know you'd be bound by a sacred vow to keep my secret. But I cannot tell you their names. For I, too, am bound. As I am bound now to confess my sins. So listen, Father Listen.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am a nun. What did I give those boys that they could not have found elsewhere? Nothing. Nothing at all. There were always two of us in the act. The act was half my own. It does not seem to me the act was half the act of a once of Christ.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is the lost chance that will remain on the ledger of my sins. Not the loss of my virginity. The rape forced upon me a choice. As a vessel of the spirit. I could have imbued my vagina with God. Or, I could have turned away from God and voided my body of spirit, so that all that was left for those boys was a lump of flesh. I chose the second path. The easier, path. The path of the material world. The path no nun has the right to take. And so, I sinned.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My vagina spread, but spread no word. It opened, on nothingness. It gave nothing at all and left nothing behind. No trace of my act, yes my act. For I was there, too, remains in the landscape of God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NUN>
<DIRECTION>
The NUN'S description of the RAPE is both a turn on for LT and a matter of profound curiosity. Something divine. His silent reactions embody both decadence and awe. This apparent paradox can find unified expression in his character, though at other moments it threatens to tear him apart. The tension between the two polarities will propel him toward his destiny.
</DIRECTION>
<NUN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus turned water to wine. I ought to have turned bitter semen to fertile sperm -- hatred to love. And maybe to have saved their souls. They did not love me. I ought to have loved them. As Jesus loved those who reviled him. I ought to have surprised those boys. Instead, they surprised me, and got no surprise at all. No, they did not rape a nun. But a nun has been raped. And the nun must now atone for her sin. For a God-given part of her was wasted. A part which other women use for procreation, for conjugal fulfillment, for expressions of love. I had but one chance. And I did nothing but react in pain.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When those boys placed their hands upon my breasts, they had nothing but an assortment of skin cells in their grasp. They ought to have felt, through me. The bosom of their Redeemer. When they lay on top of me and looked down into my eyes, they saw fear. They should have met the eyes of a lover, And felt the presence of the Prince of Peace...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My vagina. I shall never have again. And never again shall I encounter two boys whose prayer was more legible, more poignant, more anguished. Two young men who threw themselves upon the altar and took me with them. And I did nothing for them. I can only hope that someone will.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
LT can't help but start up. As if, telepathically, the NUN knew he was there and cried out to him. Asked him to complete her mission.

LT senses the confession is over. As the PRIEST begins to speak again, LT snaps to and returns to his original hiding place, near the CANDLES.

LT watches as the NUN exits the CONFESSIONAL, KNEELS, holds her ROSARY BEADS, and begins to whisper the ACT OF CONTRITION -- what LT recited as ARIANE gave him head.

<DIRECTION>
LITE tries changing the subject.
</DIRECTION>
<LITE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's the case going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LITE>
<LT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What case?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LT>
<LITE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The fucking rapists, man. The punks who raped that nun. The $50,000 reward from the Church! Remember?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LITE>
<LT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Sure. Yeah. We're on it bigtime. Lots of leads. You bet.

</LT>
<LITE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That 50 G could help you --
	</DIALOGUE>
</LITE>
<DIRECTION>
LT looks as LITE as if he's crazy. He shakes his head. Sing- songs at him as if trying to teach an impaired student.
</DIRECTION>
<LT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Mets are gonna win the Series. They're a lock.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LT>
<DIRECTION>
A change comes over LT. He leans in, gets seriously excited. LT is possessed by his memory of this afternoon's game.
</DIRECTION>
<LT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get this, man. I was at the game today. Face to fucking face with Strawberry! Jesus! I saw him strikeout. And you know what? He looked at me, and I looked at him, and he laughed and I laughed and it was like we were all alone in that whole stadium and only we understood that it was all a racket, that he struck out on purpose, and that he's saving it up for the Big One. Tomorrow. Today I understood for the very first time that --
	</DIALOGUE>
</LT>
<LITE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've really got a problem.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LITE>
<DIRECTION>
LT shakes his head. Repeats himself in that sing-song, didactic way.
</DIRECTION>
<LT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- that there was never any other way it could have gone.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never any other way. So you had better just put in my fucking bet. $120,000 on the last game. The Big One. Come on! Are you a bookmaker, or fucking what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LT>
<LITE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here. Look I'll give you the psyho's number You call him yourself and tell him wnat you want.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LITE>
<DIRECTION>
LITE stands up. He writes the BOOKIE'S NUMBER on a MATCHBOOK and gives it to LT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LITE leans over and gives LT a final warning.
</DIRECTION>
<LITE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You couldn't pay 60. You lose, you'll be in for 180. To a guy who kills people for nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LITE>
<DIRECTION>
LT LAUGHS. He's already onto the next thing. He checks out the GIRLS at the other TABLES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LITE takes to go. Then decides to try once more to get LT's attention.
</DIRECTION>
<LITE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was supposed to meet him at midnight with the 60. It's already 1:00 AM. Be careful. I mean it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LITE>
<DIRECTION>
LT is still laughing as LITE leaves the V.I.P ROOM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Before going out the door, LITE turns to look one more time at his friend.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV LITE - LT is engaged in a clumsy come-on. Oblivious. The last thing LITE sees is LT grabbing a COCKTAIL WAITRESS' LEG and falling out of his chair. LT LAUGHS all the way to the FLOOR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LITE lowers his head and exits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LT gets up a moment later, brushes himself off, and swaggers out of the V.I.P. ROOM.
</DIRECTION>

INT: NIGHT - THE LIMELIGHT CLUB
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LT is in the throng again. The MUSIC blasts, the PARTIERS push and shove...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LT elbows his way through the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He makes moves on GIRLS. Banters with PATRONS. At the DOOR, he hesitates before going out, dallies with the BOUNCER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LT felt safe in the CLUB. New he's gotta go OUTSIDE. He's shit-scared.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LT leaves the CLUB for the STREET, looking over his shoulder all the way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT: NIGHT - STAIRWELL OF J.C.'S APARTMENT BUILDING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LT enters an APARTMENT BUILDING, faces a dark and sinister staircase.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STRANGE NOISES come from the APARTMENTS ABOVE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LT climbs. He hugs the wall, GUN at the ready. To LT, it seems some gothic horror may await him at any turn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On one landing, he comes upon a PIT-BULL. A GRANDMOTHER pulls him back inside an APARTMENT by the LEASH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On another landing, he sees a JUNKIE SHOOTING UP in the shadows. On another landing, a BIG GUY comes barreling out of his APARTMENT and down the stairs, almost bringing LT down with him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On another landing, a guy is taking out very PECULIAR GARBAGE. It might be body parts to an active imagination. At last, he reaches the DOOR to the APARTMENT for which he's been looking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HARD CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT: NIGHT - J.C.'S STRAIGHT PUERTO RICAN APARTMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A cheerful apartment. Quite different in atmosphere from the STAIRWELL, above.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A large, multi-generation PUERTO RICAN FAMILY sits around the dinner table, eating CHICKEN ON RICE AND BEANS. JC is at the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RELIGIOUS ARTIFACTS abound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CODED KNOCK on the DOOR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JC jumps up to answer it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's LT. (The hideous stairs led here.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JC lets him in.
</DIRECTION>
<JC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How are you doing, man?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JC>
<LT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very good. Very good. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LT>
<DIRECTION>
JC notes LT's bizarre manner. Decides to humor his paranoid catatonia.
</DIRECTION>
<JC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. Here. Just a moment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JC>
<DIRECTION>
JC reaches into a bookcase, looking for something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile, LT looks around the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV LT - A SHRINE is in the corner. CANDLES are lit before PLASTER SAINTS, AFRICAN DEITIES, other icons abstruse and exotic. A large "MADONNA AND CHILD", painted on black velvet, hangs above the SHRINE. The MADONNA AND CHILD are BLACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LT takes this all in. JC startles him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JC is holding a CIGAR BOX. He opens it. It's full of CASH. JC hands it to LT.
</DIRECTION>
<JC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This should be it. Oh, wait.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to an old woman at the table)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mamacita?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JC>
<DIRECTION>
MAMACITA takes some VIALS of CRACK out of her APRON.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SMILES. JC takes them from her, give them to LT.
</DIRECTION>
<JC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There. Now you've got your profit and more. You'll have more product day after tomorrow, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JC>
<LT>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh - right. Sure. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.

(beat - looks at LT with concern)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take care of yourself, man, OK? Be cool.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JC>
<DIRECTION>
LT nods, puts MAMACITA'S CRACK VIALS in his pocket. He notices that --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV LT - CU - The CIGAR BOX is inlaid with a CROSS, made of costume jewels. Other strange symbols surround it. It could be cursed -- or blessed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LT turns to go. The DOOR closes behind him. He's gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT: NIGHT - STREET NEAR ARIANE'S APARTMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LT walks through the streets on the way to ARIANE'S. He carries the CIGAR BOX.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, a SHOT rings out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ZOOM IN ON - CU LT Horror. Doubtless it was meant for him. LT panics. Freezes. As in a dream, he cannot run.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV LT - RAPID. ERRATIC. HAND HELD - LT looks for SNIPERS in the anonymous dark WINDOWS on the anonymous darks walls that create the mescarole canyon of the STREET.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LT is entirely alone. He is stock-still, victim of his own terror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly. LT can move. He takes out his GUN, presses himself against the nearest WALL. From that position, he hears --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BRASH FEMALE VOICE, coming from somewhere in the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is almost as loud as the "SHOT".
</DIRECTION>
<BRASH_FEMALE_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(OC)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey motherfucker! Take that backfire up the ass!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRASH_FEMALE_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
LT can't believe that there is no "SNIPER", there was never any SHOT. It was a BACKFIRE!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - The CAR in question passes by. It HONKS, defiantly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Evidently, it is the CAR that had BACKFIRED.
</DIRECTION>
<BRASH_FEMALE_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(OC)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck you.

INT: LATE NIGHT - ARIANE'S APARTMENT

LT rushes in, triple bolts the DOOR behind him. He immediately pulls the DRAPES.

	Someone just took a shot at me...

<DIRECTION>
Ariane laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<ARIANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, baby Sure And you don't do cocaine, either.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARIANE>
<DIRECTION>
LT turns on her. Adamant. Pleading with her to believe him.
</DIRECTION>
<LT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not the drugs, Ariane, it's -- it's someone who wants to kill me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

	Why?

ARIANE walks away, speaks with her back to LT.
</DIRECTION>
<LT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just kick back, baby. Make yourself at home.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(suddenly pissed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But of course it won't be nobody's home, if you don't come through with the fucking rent!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LT>
<DIRECTION>
LT lays his COAT down on the BED. Puts the CIGAR BOX of MONEY under it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LT sits down near the PHONE. He lights his CRACKPIPE with a MATCH from the MATCHBOOK on which LITE wrote the BOOKIE'S NUMBER. Then he tries to reach the BOOKIE. Some sort of wacky Mob joint answers.
</DIRECTION>
<LT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello? Is LARGE there?

The MOB VOICE (CO) HANGS UP ON LT.

LT tries to strangle the PHONE.

LT REDIALS.

The line is BUSY.

LT makes the strangulation gesture again. ARIANE laughs at him.
</DIRECTION>
<ARIANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mere. You got some good blow, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARIANE>
<LT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LT>
<ARIANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then c'mere. I got something for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARIANE>
<DIRECTION>
ARIANE pulls out a pristine NEEDLE. LT comes but flinches at the sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Apparently BOWTAY overheard that drugs are on the way. BOWTAY appears out of the KITCHEN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOWTAY sits down near by, awaiting her DOSE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ARIANE starts preparing the DOSE. She's got all the paraphernalia: SPOON. COTTON, a CANDLE FLAME, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<ARIANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First I'll put your Uptown in the spoon, then, to make it more exciting, I'm gonna add some Downtown. They call this thing a speedball, honey, but then you must know that...
	</DIALOGUE>

(beat -- she leans in)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First time shooting up?

</ARIANE>
<LT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nah...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LT>
<ARIANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure it is. You're a virgin. Just like that nun. And I'm gonna rape you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARIANE>
<DIRECTION>
That decides it for LT. He sits down like a little boy and lets ARIANE shoot him up with the potent mixture of COCAINE and HEROIN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ARIANE shoots up BOWTAY, next.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They do it on the BED, exploiting all possible erotic connotations.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When LT rushes, he gets totally paranoid. Jumps at sounds, sneaks to the WINDOW, hears noises that aren't there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he flips, and becomes crazy-bold. Opens the DRAPES. Sticks his head out the WINDOW, waves his GUN at specters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he becomes shit-scared, again. His behavior is lunatic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ARIANE LAUGHS at his antics.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally LT becomes wildly sensual. Revealing himself with total abandon. Dances. In the midst of this --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The PHONE RINGS LT is seriously startled. Then he realizes who it may be. He slowly answers the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LT can hardly speak. He is NUDE, and communicating from another world syllable by syllable.

</LT>
<DIRECTION>
ARIANE SHRUGS, waves his dig aside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LT leaps up. He's on a manic roll. Conceives an insanely captivating, impossible idea. As he speaks, he speeds more and more until he seems to be reciting a rapid-fire tongue twister perfect.
</DIRECTION>
<LT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got it, man! I will find those kids. And I'll get the 50 G from the Church! Then the kids'll go to jail. I'll be in charge, of course. After a little while, I'll break the fuckers out -- and I'll turn them in to shithead I was just talking to. And pick up his 100 G. No. I'll hit him up for 200 G. Or 250 G. l can do it -- 'cause I've got the kids. Then, of course, there's the 180 G I'm gonna pick up on the Game tonight -- when the Strawberries win!

ARIANE LAUGHS, decides to go with it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LT, out of breath from his tirade, lets the Downtown half of his dose kick in but good.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sits down in the same EASY CHAIR in which he nodded out the morning of the desecration.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nodding out, he stares out the same WINDOW. His eyes close.

As it was that morning only four days ago, the SUNRISE is blood red.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CU - The ALABASTER NUN. She is lying cross -- probably has been all night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VARIOUS ANGLES. The still-desecrated CHURCH in all its enduring glory. Shafts of blood-red dawn-light. The NUN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIME PASSES.

VARIOUS ANGLES. Mid-morning; The NUN is still lying cross.

<DIRECTION>
TIME PASSES.

<DIRECTION>
VARIOUS ANGLES. High Noon. The NUN is still lying cross.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LT appears in the doorway, a black silhouette against the white light of noon. For a moment, he watches her from a distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The NUN knows he is there. After a time, she gets up, goes to the altar, kneels. As if waiting for him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LT staggers down the center aisle. He's carrying the CIGAR BOX.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LT joins the NUN, kneeling next to her at the altar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - The CHALICE is still missing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are all alone. At the ALTAR, before the CRUCIFIX, LT confronts the NUN face to face. The NUN holds her ROSARY BEADS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LT finally speaks. He thinks she'll be turned on by his offer of "help".
</DIRECTION>
<LT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen to me, Sister, listen to me good. The other cops'll just put the guys through the system. They're juveniles. They'll walk! Get it? But I'll beat the system and do justice. Real justice. For you.

The NUN turns to run.

<NUN>

LT is desperate. He lunges forward. Pleads with her.

<LT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on lady! They put out cigarettes on your tits, man! Get with the program! Don't you want them behind bars? Or away from the world for good? How could you forgive these motherfu -- excuse me. These guys. How could you? Deep down, don't you want them to pay for what they did to you? Don't you want the crime avenged?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LT>
<NUN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have forgiven them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NUN>
<LT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nun! These boys still have their weapons, Sister. Your forgiveness will leave blood in its wake. What if they do it to other nuns? Other virgins? Old women who die from the shock? Do you have the rights let these boys go free? Can you bear the burden. Sister?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LT>
<DIRECTION>
The NUN turns to him, simple and pure, pure and simple.
</DIRECTION>
<NUN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have prayed for days, Lieutenant. I have prayed for the souls of the boys who raped me. And I have prayed for my own soul, too. I know what I must do. And I know what I must not do.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

	</DIALOGUE>
</NUN>
<LT>
<DIRECTION>
(takes yet another tack)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look. Sister. No one has to get killed. We can solve this together. You and me -- as one. These boys are lost sheep. Both Catholic -- did you know that? And they're sick, Sister. With a stress of the mind and of the soul. They need help. Not just jail. Not just psychiatry. They need the help that only the Church can give. Please help me to help them. Help me find them before the others do. The night is full of evil men, chasing these boys with guns and clubs. We have charity and love on our side. I know that together, we could find them first, even in the dark...

The NUN has finished her morning prayers.

For a moment, she looks deep into LT's eyes.

<DIRECTION>
Then she gets up and leaves LT alone in the CHURCH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LT comes face to face with the mammoth CRUCIFIX. He is transfixed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV - LT - JESUS on the CROSS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Soon, LT hears a VOICE.

LT is not shocked or even surprised. He speaks to JESUS as to someone he's known all his life.

POV LT - The CRUCIFIX takes on an hallucinatory radiance.

Taking that aura with him, JESUS comes down off the CROSS, and moves toward LT, who is still kneeling at the ALTAR.

Worst of all, why can't I feel the nails in my palms, the spear in my side, the crown of thorns round my head? Why do I have to know, over and over, that it was you. You who died; died for my sins! And that I will die for nothing. Why?

LT averts his eyes. When he looks up again --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JESUS is back on the CROSS. Inert, and yet --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LT rises, moves around the interior of the CHURCH. He stumbles, struggles, pleads. Falls, rises, falls and rises again -- as if wrestling with an invisible assailant.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He collapses in a corner.
</DIRECTION>
<LT>

	Oh God, my God. it's goddamn good to be good. Forgive me. Father, for I have sinned. It's still goddamn good to be good.

<DIRECTION>
In the aftermath of his revelation, he notices, cleanly, a hunched, ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN carrying something toward the ALTAR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He staggers toward her. Yes. The ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN has the CHALICE!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LT grabs the CHALICE. The ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN doesn't let go.
</DIRECTION>
<LT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The chalice. Tell me! Who gave it to you! Tell me where the fuck you got it! Take me there! Now!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LT>
<DIRECTION>
At first, she doesn't speak at all. LT begins to CRY. Begs her to tell him. Then he wields his PISTOL, repeats his plea. Then breaks into TEARS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She speaks at last.
</DIRECTION>
<ELDERLY_BLACK_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't tell you.

Gun in hand, LT gets down on his knees.

She meets LT's eyes, seems to understand something. Calmly, she tells him what he needs to know.
</DIRECTION>
<ELDERLY_BLACK_WOMAN>

	It's very hard. He's a -- you're not a cop, are you?

	No. Not a cop.

<ELDERLY_BLACK_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My husband is a fence. He got this chalice from a couple of kids. Just yesterday, I think. I stole it out of his shop so as to return it to where it ought to be. It's a holy thing, you know. A holy thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELDERLY_BLACK_WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN lets go of the CHALICE. Now LT holds ten CHALICE in his hands, alone. He speaks as if entranced.
</DIRECTION>
<LT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A holy thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat -- snaps to)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LT>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly purposive, LT grabs the ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN by the arm. Starts pulling her out of the CHURCH. He holds the CHALICE with the other arm, picks up the CIGAR BOX on his way out. Manages to carry both items.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When LT and the ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN reach the door to outside, they both pause to GENUFLECT.
</DIRECTION>

Then LT grabs her again and they rush out.

LT walks the ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN swiftly through the streets toward the FENCE'S SHOP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He still holds the CHALICE and the CIGAR BOX.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PEOPLE watch them pass and make way. As if they realize that something is happening -- on several levels at once. The GAME has begun. It is on TV in every BAR and SHOP WINDOW. In both English and Spanish. Slowly but surely, the Mets are losing.

LT and the ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN enter the SHOP. LT is wielding the CHALICE and the CIGAR BOX. He has true madness m his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV LT - The GAME is playing on a couple dozen TV's in the FENCE'S SHOP' The Mets are still losing!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The FENCE, and elderly Black man, is sitting in one of many EASY CHAIRS. He doesn't seem surprised to see his WIFE. Or the CHALICE. Or LT! It's as if he expected them.
</DIRECTION>
<FENCE>

The ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN is obviously relieved.
</DIRECTION>
<FENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, woman! What did you think? You thought I'd get mad like I did that time you took that set of pots and pans? That was twenty years ago. And how do you compare pots and pans and a chalice?

LT speaks up suddenly.

After a beat, the FENCE and his WIFE start LAUGHING. LT joins in.

	That's no mystery. Julio and Paolo brought it in,

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. How could you understand.

The FENCE seems to study LT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV FENCE - LT. Wretched.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The FENCE thinks again.
</DIRECTION>
<FENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well -- maybe you do. But I don't know where those boys are at right now. You'll have to ask around. Those boys on the corner'll know. You'll have to get it out of them. But they know.

CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT: LATE AFTERNOON - THE STREETS IN THE BARRIO - MONTAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LT stumbles through the streets, questioning people about "JULIO and PAOLO". No one knows anything. LT stops people at random, getting really desperate. He shows people the CHALICE, asks them if they've seen it before. No one has.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LT plays both ADDICT and COP as it suits his needs. By now, he looks more like a homeless man than anything else. But none of his play-acting or lethal threats get him anywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The GAME is everywhere, and the Mets are still losing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, LT approaches a hustling STREET DEALER. He cops. The STREET DEALER is wearing a WALKMAN, so the deal goes down in mime.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now, LT speaks and wants to be heard.
</DIRECTION>
<LT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey -- Have you seen Paolo or Julio around?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LT>
<DIRECTION>
The STREET DEALER uses his WALKMAN and the resulting "deafness" to excuse his total lack of response.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LT starts MOUTHING WORDS silently at the STREET DEALER. No response. Then, he -- silently -- begins to shout.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The STREET DEALER's alarmed that he seemingly can't hear at all above the WALKMAN music. He moves the WALKMAN away from his ears but doesn't take it off.
</DIRECTION>
<STREET_DEALER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the fuck you want.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STREET_DEALER>
<LT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, my Uncle used to wear a walkman all the time. The walkman looked just like yours. And you look something like my Uncle. But one day he was standing in a puddle -- the puddle locked just like that one --

LT points to a PUDDLE in which the STREET DEALER is now Standing.
</DIRECTION>
<STREET_DEALER>

	And what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STREET_DEALER>
<LT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And he got electrocuted.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LT>
<DIRECTION>
The STREET DEALER tries to consider what this crazy guy has just told him, but before the STREET DEALER can even react. LT leans in on him, shows his GUN and then his BADGE.
</DIRECTION>
<LT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look -- I don't know you, and you don't know me, but I'm really in the mood to kill someone today and you are at the end of my gun.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me! Where is Julio and Paolo ?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LT>
<DIRECTION>
The STREET DEALER answers with absolute ease. That was all it was about? No problem.
</DIRECTION>
<STREET_DEALER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They were at that abandoned building last night. Second floor. They're probably still there now. It's next to the old Convent. Downtown a ways. You know the place...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STREET_DEALER>
<DIRECTION>
CU. LT - It hits him. The CRACKHOUSE where the kids hang out has always been right next to the CHURCH/CONVENT where it an began! It suddenly makes sense to him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LT completes re transaction, pays the STREET DEALER for the DRUG BAGS. He takes the CASH out of the CIGAR BOX, revealing dozens of thousands of dollars.

The STREET DEALER stares at the wretched man with a box full of cash.

LT, carrying the CHALICE and the CIGAR BOX, heads back Downtown toward the CRACKHOUSE -- and the CHURCH/CONVENT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In BARS, TV STORE WINDOWS, in snatches of strangers' conversation, the FINAL GAME IS EVERYWHERE. The whole city has stopped to watch it. LT is practically the only person in the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Worst of all, the Mets are seriously behind. They are definitely LOSING.

LT drags himself onward.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The other CRACKHEADS race out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is even a TV in the CRACKHOUSE -- playing the GAME! The SOUND is Off. The Mets keep losing. If anything will force LT to kill/and or take the KIDS into custody, this would seem to be it.

LT sits down next to the KIDS. SMOKES with them, watches the Game. LT must hold the PIPE for them, as they are HANDCUFFED.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LT gets them super-high, and himself likewise. He still holds his GUN.

LT has the KIDS handcuffed in the back seat. (The Scene mirrors Scene 2. in which LT drove his own TWINS to school.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The FINAL GAME (SEVEN) is on the RADIO. LT is listening, but also not listening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LT talks wildly about Jesus Christ. And about the misery they pass in the street. He waves his GUN wildly, punctuating his speech with potentially lethal gestures. He aims the GUN at JULIO and PAULO, then at himself, then out the window, then at the KIDS, again.

	If you think you're not getting on this bus, you're dead wrong. No fucking way are you gonna miss this bus, man! You were probably the kind of kids who had your father drive you to school cause you couldn't catch the fucking bus. But no more, man. You're getting on this bus and you're taking it to the last fucking stop. So get on the fucking bus, man, 'cause you're life ain't worth shit in this town.
