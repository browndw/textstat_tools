EXT. HALFWAY HOUSE PORCH. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KYM, a darkly beautiful girl in her early 20's, is smoking furiously on the porch of an URBAN HALFWAY HOUSE. She glances impatiently at her watch and presses her ear to her cell phone. As she exhales, WE HEAR the rumble of thunder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Irritated, she crams her cell phone into her bag. ROSA a halfway house staff nurse is patiently handling WALTER, an irate patient who is screeching...
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want my fucking Zippo now!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Walter starts yanking at his hair.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Walter, that is a behavior...

<WALTER>

</WALTER>
<ROSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you are making a choice.

Her cell phone rings...

<ROSA>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold on...Hello?

</ROSA>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<KYM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you get it yet, Waldo? She's making a choice not to give you your lighter because you'll torch the Self-Help library again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYM>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm Walter. Kill anybody recently? Run anybody over with a fucking car?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Kym grinds her cigarette under her heel and blows smoke but gives no signal that she's heard anything. She yanks her cell phone out of her bag as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A tan Mercedes STATION WAGON pulls up in front of the House.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSA>
<DIRECTION>
(to Kym)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSA>
<KYM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Finally.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYM>
<DIRECTION>
Rosa takes two of Kym's several bags. They are oddly matched. A Coach tote, a fake Prada, a Gristedes bag, and a World Wildlife Fund tote bag.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not letting her get behind the wheel are you? Are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<ROSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Walter, you are only responsible for yourself.

(To Kym)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is all your stuff?

</ROSA>
<KYM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know you never gave me your cell number.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYM>
<ROSA>
<DIRECTION>
(sotto)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was a mistake. I'm lucky I didn't get fired. We've discussed this.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(She offers her hand)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good luck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSA>
<DIRECTION>
Kym doesn't appear to have heard her but she shakes the hand barely... so very, very faintly. Kym's dad, PAUL BUCHMAN, a tired, prosperous man in his late 50's steps around the car and trots up the porch steps. He is wearing a big smile and his glasses are foggy. They hug. Kym talks rapidly over his shoulder...
</DIRECTION>
<KYM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my god. Here you are. I thought you were going to abandon me in rehab. It's 12:30. You guys are half an hour late. I've been standing here with these lunatics. You look so great.

Paul offers his hand to Rosa.

	</DIALOGUE>
</KYM>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No wedding planners or anything like that. Just her and Sidney and a lot of their friends. She is so thrilled you're here. Is that everything, sweetheart?

EXT./INT. TRANSITIONAL SHOTS. DAY The station wagon travels through a constantly changing series of environments as they journey out of New York City on their drive to suburban Connecticut.

Right away though, Kym lights up a cigarette and Paul and Carol crank their windows.
</DIRECTION>
<KYM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So are all these busy young wedding helpers staying at the house? Because after eight months of constantly revolving cell mates and crazy people...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYM>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You weren't in a cell, Kym...

	The only extra person staying at the house is Emma, who's actually been staying in your old room. But she can move, I guess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROL>
<KYM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rachel and Emma. Oh, great. How relaxing. The only two people on the planet less capable of delegating than Hannibal! On the eve of a wedding! Nachtmare.

</KYM>
<CAROL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nachtmare?

	...Is she eating? Or are all her latent food issues rearing their heads? Is she hoarding Snickers and Cool Whip under the bed like in high school? She never did put that one to sleep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYM>
<PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
(genuine)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think that that's a problem for her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<KYM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No offense, Dad, but you never thought that was a problem for her. I'm kidding. It'll be great to see her. Foodies are the worst, though. They never get it together. There were six of them on my floor in the hospital and you could never get into the bathroom. They would cry at the chocolate pudding and one of them was a guy. I can't wait to see Mom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYM>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll see her and Andrew at the rehearsal dinner tonight.

The atmosphere is slightly punch drunk and friendly.

INT. UPSTAIRS. DAY. CONTINUOUS --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kym slams open the master bedroom door and finds her older sister, RACHEL, trying on her wedding dress with the help of her best friend EMMA. Radiant and sexy, Rachel glows like an angel in her creamy white and gold sari. Emma has pins in her mouth and a tape measure around her neck.

<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No seriously, you're so tiny it's like you're Asian. Dad wants us to sleep in the same room so you'll be able to watch me while he's asleep and I won't sneak out of the house and blow dealers and shoot heroin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYM>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad did not say "blow dealers."
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<KYM>
	<DIALOGUE>

	Kym, I'm not remotely surprised you're starting your drama already, however it's Rachel's wedding and this week it's about her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMMA>
<KYM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Emma, you still have your tiny core of rage! What a relief.

</KYM>

Kym flops on the bed and gazes adoringly at her sister for a moment. Rachel beams back.
</DIRECTION>
<KYM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So are you an actual shrink yet? Even though you're like twelve years old?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYM>
<EMMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Psychology. Not psychiatry. You know the difference, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMMA>
<KYM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should prescribe something soothing for Emma. Like Vicodin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYM>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will have my PhD. in a year and a half. And psychologists don't get prescription pads, right Kym?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<KYM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They do in Guam.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYM>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you please put that out? Emma designed this dress and there's forty-seven yards of it and I'll go up like the Hindenburg.

Kym takes a last drag even though she's down to the filter, then flushes the butt down the toilet in the tiny bathroom.

	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<KYM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's so great. I think I heard that. Isn't this your fifth incarnation or something? Weren't you an actress? All the N.E.D.'s in the hospital were actresses...

</KYM>
<EMMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Elvis Stoyko the figure skater?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMMA>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In her fantasy, she was wearing her hair up and very serious, responsible eyeglasses, because she was a world renowned judge at the Winter Olympics for Men's Figure Skating. And Elvis Stoyko was skating in the finals to "Could It Be Magic" for the gold medal. And just when Barry Manilow is singing "Now/ Now/ Now and hold on fast..." there's this electric connection between them and he stops in the middle of his triple lutz...axel...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<KYM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And he skates over to the judges table, all panting and sweaty, with his spangly Neil Diamond shirt open to the chest...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYM>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is silence as he stops in front of her, their eyes lock, and he reaches for her hand... and Angela takes it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<KYM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To the roar of the crowd and the shock of the Olympic judges! And he pulls her out of her chair, undoes her hair, and they skate as a pair to the rest of the song!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYM>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And he gets disqualified but he doesn't care!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<EMMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where'd she get the skates from?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMMA>

They collapse in laughter. Kym studies her ass in the mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<KYM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I should call her right this second. Is she really coming? Who are all these energetic young people decorating the house?

	<DIALOGUE>
	It's softball. Someone was chasing them.

Fiancee SIDNEY, sexy, compact, thirties, and best man KIERAN, are stringing lights all over the house and yard. Kieran is on a ladder. He is the same ATTRACTIVE GUY from the meeting. Sidney is completely wrapped, chest to knees, in twinkly white lights and he unspools himself as needed. Rachel arrives with Kym who is holding the aircraft carrier sized meatloaf sandwich that's oozing lettuce and ketchup and the enormous glass of milk. She holds them both like they're suspended in formaldehyde. Emma is working on her tan.

INT. BASEMENT. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kym and Kieran, having SEX in the cavernous basement. It runs practically the length of the house and there are nooks and caves everywhere. An ancient sofa, riddled with cigarette burns, some futons, dragged down and thrown haphazardly in corners, Unicorn posters hideously and pornographically defaced, and squat jars of ancient household products (Oil of Olay, self tanner) filled with cigarette butts offer proof of years of inhabitation. LATER -- Kym lights up.

</KIERAN>
<KYM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is kind of lurid, isn't it? The best man and the maid of honor... furtively slipping off to the coal bin to have it off while the rest of the wedding party labors away at preparations for the big event.

INT. HIGH-END INDIAN CLOTHING BOUTIQUE. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LAVISH BOLLYWOOD SOUNDTRACK PLAYS as Emma wraps Kym in lilac fabric for her sari-esque bridesmaid's dress. Kym examines herself in the mirrors of the private salon. The girls look like jewels against the lush fabrics, pillows and curtains. Rachel sits at a vanity trying on dangling earrings and shakes her head gently, the gems glimmer and sparkle.

	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<KYM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, but I got paid for that and I was on horse tranquilizers. So why aren't I the Maid of Honor? Why is Emma the Maid of Honor?

Old friend Norman Sklear is emceeing the line-up -- he is currently at the mike with a funny improv based on really disastrous weddings he has known. Everybody is laughing.

WILLIAMS (Sidney's mom and dad), sister KAYRA, grandmother HERREAST, and cousin JOSEPH GONZALES (in US Army dress uniform, home on leave from Iraq) blend easily with the younger crowd.

INT. UKRAINIAN MUSEUM DINING HALL. NIGHT. THE DINNER-- The forty-odd guests are now seated in an adjoining room at LONG TABLES laden with a GORGEOUS INDIAN FEAST. Yellow rice, red curry, vivid green and orange vegetable dishes, pink shrimp. Huge plates of Dosa and Brinjal. Candles flicker in lanterns shaped like lotuses. PHOTOGENICALLY STYLISH YOUNG SERVERS dressed elegantly in black and white hover around the family and friends as everybody makes total pigs of themselves. The INDIAN FEAST contrasts agreeably with the Ukrainian visuals. EVOCATIVE BOLLYWOOD MUSIC PROVIDES THE SOUNDTRACK. Kym, wandering on along the table like a nomad, wedges herself between Sidney and Rachel. Emma grabs an empty wine glass before Kym knocks it over.

	I've known Sidney most of my life. He personifies many of life's grandest cliches, even as he breathes fresh life into most of them. He has never, ever "ceased to amaze me," and only in the best of ways. The magnitude of his artistry and his business acumen are matters of public record and delight. He's been a great friend "through thick and thin," and sometimes it's gotten very, very thin -- but he "stood by me" at all times, so it is my privilege and honor to stand by him on this profound occasion...

	Well I would like to share with everyone that Miss Rachel-before she got her license or even had any idea how to drive- out maneuvered an irate, screaming cab driver across 96th street to the East river, handily avoiding two EMT guys loading an old lady on a gurney, while at the same time, applying Cocofudge Lip Gloss in the rearview mirror.

	We were driving so fast! It was one of the more exhilarating moments in my life...sadly...but I knew that Miss Rachel would make it okay. So here's to you, my dear, dear friend.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyhoo, as more of you know than are likely to admit, one of the actual steps is about making amends. So I spent a lot of time calling up people who barely remembered me - who barely remembered anything - and apologizing to them for bouncing a check or passing out in the bathtub and flooding their house, or otherwise involving them in sordid activities they were desperately trying to forget. I had to call this one girl who was, I think, fourteen, but I couldn't talk to her because her Mom took out a restraining order.

Kym thinks this is hysterical. Paul does not.

	Anyway, I did a lot of apologizing to people who were practically strangers so I very much want to take this opportunity to not only congratulate my extraordinary sister, the future explorer in matters of the mind, thank you very much, and her adorable, impending husband on the occasion of their unprecedented nuptials.. but also to apologize to my extraordinary sister, the future explorer in matters of the mind, for... Everything! And I really mean that, Rachel. I've been a nightmare and you've been a saint. I'm so damned glad I'm here with you and Sidney and his family and ours, and I am so happy for you guys, I really am. So, I am hereby raising my seltzer in celebration of my laudatory sister and herewith making amends. Sidney, you are robbing our dysfunctional family of one of it's most vital ingredients, and it's only member still willing to lend me money.

</PAUL>
<RACHEL>

</KYM>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please. That's hardly news. You may not know this...sure you do...the only way to engage Dad in any meaningful communication is to start the conversation with your name. "Have you heard from Kym? How's Kym?" It resuscitates him. It jars him into the moment. Like an alarm.

The restaurant is fluorescently lit, with a Jamaican flag on the wall and photos of Muhammad Ali, Malcolm X, and Bob Marley. There is a counter at the front where you place your order and pick up your food. There is a Foosball table, and a pinball machine.

	We were in the park. I was sixteen and I was...I had taken all these Percoset. I was unbelievably high. He had thrown away his shoes- and I was like "Mom's going to kill me" because I had no idea where his shoes were- but he was so happy about it. And he had his red socks and he was running around kicking up the leaves. You know in movies where they show a person's high or whatever and the camera careens all around? It was like that. But fun. You know. We were having so much fun. We were leaping around in huge piles of leaves. He buried me. I buried him in a big pile. I was on baby sitting detail. He was pretending he was a train. So he was charging through the leaf pile, making tracks, you know? I was the caboose. And he kept going "Coal, caboose! Coal caboose!" So it's time to go and we're driving home and he's in his car seat still demanding coal, and I couldn't focus and I drove off the bridge. The car went into the lake. I couldn't get him out of his car seat. He drowned.

	You know what I was. It's not like there weren't any clues. I stayed in my room for days. I passed out all the time. Where were you, Mom! What were you thinking? Why did you leave me? Why did you leave me in charge of him?

EXT. ABBY'S/ANDREW'S HOUSE. NIGHT.

Kym falls down the front steps. Her nose is bleeding and her eye starts to swell. Where are the car keys? Here they are. Where is the door handle? Here it is. She drives off.

Kym driving the station wagon too fast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STATION WAGON. NIGHT. --KYM'S P.O.V.: THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD-- Headlights. Windshield wipers. It's not raining. A curve in the road, squealing around it. The road forks twenty yards ahead, woods in between. Left or right? Kym drives straight ahead, careening off the road, smashing down a couple of saplings, losing speed, right fender smashing into a big rock -- AIRBAGS blast up into Kym's face -- airbag deflates, Kym's head falls forward, bangs against the steering wheel. A tiny moan. That's it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WIDE SHOT. FORK IN THE ROAD. NIGHT.

The station wagon has come to a halt far off the road, concealed by undergrowth and trees in the foreground. There is no movement in the car. A Volvo station wagon drives by, continuing on its way.

<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I never thought I'd have two little girls. Two little girls running around with their tummies sticking out in their diapers. They used to bite me on the nose, the two of them. I'd hold both of them in the pool and they'd take turns biting my nose. Ethan never did that. He preferred pinkies. Or knuckles...

INT. MASTER BEDROOM. NIGHT.

Rachel and Emma are curled up in the middle of the bed, spoon- style, with clothes still on. Emma is behind Rachel, lost to the world, gently snoring. Rachel's eyes are wide open. Carol swings the door cautiously open and peers inside. Rachel and Carol look at each other for a long time. Carol withdraws, closing the door behind her.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT/INT. STATION WAGON. MORNING. Kym jolts awake as a STAMFORD POLICEMAN raps on her closed window. She is a mess. A black eye. A split, bloody lip. A gash across her forehead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cop is simultaneously gesturing for her to roll her window down and speaking into his radio.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kym tries to start the car. No luck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cop bangs on the window. Kym leans her head against the steering wheel. The horn starts blowing.

The joggers, a couple of early dogwalkers, and a couple of kids on bikes are gathered by the roadside, whispering and watching.

The crowd of onlookers has swelled considerably.

<DIRECTION>
NOW -- The cop gives a clearly upset Kym a Breathalyzer test as PARAMEDICS wrap a pressure cuff around her arm -- she exhales into the Breathalyzer tube, her eyes darting between the cop, the cracked windshield of the car and the gawking crowd up on the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIME CUT -- The paramedic holds Kym firmly by the chin and peers deeply into her right eye. The other paramedic blots at Kym's swollen lip with a gauze and hands her an ice pack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIME CUT -- The cop gives Kym her license and hands her an official looking form, which she stuffs in her shoulder bag.

EXT. THE BUCHMAN HOUSE. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A truck towing the beat-up station wagon comes to a halt in the street in front of the Buchman house. Kym steps down from the passenger seat, ignoring whatever the driver just said in parting. The house is festooned with peonies and lights and WORKERS hurrying about. Everything looks absolutely beautiful. CATERERS are running from their vans into the house with armloads of food, drinks, etc. Abby's flowers are being unloaded from another van. Decorative chandeliers are being carried inside. VALETS are setting up their car-parking operation (a decorated picnic table) at the foot of the driveway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kym squares her shoulders and begins her long walk up to the Buchman house, back into the chaos. A CUTE VALET passes Kym on the lawn, carrying two paper cups of coffee, dressed in an Indian military tunic. He takes in Kym's disheveled and bruised appearance.

A dancer rocks with an older gentleman who gulps oxygen from a tank.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rachel and Sidney are bathed in sweat, kissing. Sidney is gulping champagne.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kieran and Kym have their foreheads together and their eyes closed, chests heaving.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DRUMS CRESCENDO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carol and Paul watching, laughing. Andrew whispering in Abby's ear. She just stares off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kieran and Kym glued together.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rachel tossing her hair wildly, Sidney behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone laughing, laughing, dancing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DRUMS STOP!!!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HUGE WHOOPS AND HOLLERS!!!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BUCHMAN BACKYARD. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The exotic tent looks beautiful out there in the sprawling backyard, reflections of the POOL LIGHTS shimmering off its sides. The whole backyard is enchanted -- with magically deployed twinkle lights, Japanese lanterns and other special lighting effects adding to the aura...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"Rachel Loves Sidney" is being played in a mellow, super- romantic trumpet solo mode now by Christian Scott.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An assorted bunch of guests have relocated to the poolside patio in their finery. The oxygen guy and his matronly wife are seated on a transplanted living room couch, talking intently to a be-feathered headdressed Dancer. Norman Sklear and Emma are sharing a stylish, quietly triumphant slow dance, whispering punctuated by gusts of laughter. Angela Paylin is out there too. Little kids are running around the lawn and a few are playing with OLIVE the Dog. Kym kneels at the far corner of the swimming pool, unnoticed by anyone. A wooden serving tray floats on the surface of the water, supporting a candle wrapped in rice paper. A couple of smaller candles surround the slightly larger one. Kym lights the candles, extinguishes the match, gently slides the illuminated tray out towards the center of the pool, watches. Kym rises and walks towards the house, looking for something.
</DIRECTION>
<NEIGHBORHOOD_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
(to Kym)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can do a handstand!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEIGHBORHOOD_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
She executes a truly terrible handstand.
</DIRECTION>
<KYM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That sucked.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYM>
<DIRECTION>
The girl throws a rebellious dance move in Kym's direction.
</DIRECTION>
<KYM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ouch.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The girl laughs and runs off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT./INT. BUCHMAN LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kym crosses the back terrace and enters the living room through the flower bedecked canopy....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
where she finds Rachel and Sidney slow dancing alone and dreamy in the center of the darkened room, the walls still covered with the ceremonial flowers. A single candle flickers nearby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dancers are oblivious to Kym's presence.
</DIRECTION>
<KYM>
<DIRECTION>
(to Rachel)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi. Where's Mom?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYM>
<DIRECTION>
Rachel has her head on Sidney's shoulder, her eyes closed.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Taking a break.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<KYM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How can you take a break from your own daughter's wedding?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYM>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mom doesn't actually participate in things.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<KYM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And anyway, she hasn't even done anything all day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYM>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was thinking about getting her a cat. Cats are really annoying. At some point you have to deal with them, right? Or they starve to death and piss on your sheets.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<KYM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's so nice here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Kieran sweeps into the room.
</DIRECTION>
<KIERAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can run but you can't hide!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Kym shrieks as Kieran grabs her and plants a wet one on her, dipping her to the floor. They careen into Sidney and Rachel. Sidney grabs Rachel and starts molesting her.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
(totally into it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop! Stop you fiend!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Rachel and Sidney fall to the floor writhing, sounding way too amorous. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<ABBY_S_VOICE_OFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABBY_S_VOICE_OFF>
<KYM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYM>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The ceiling light flicks on overhead and Abby enters the living room. Blinking against the light, Rachel struggles to her feet smoothing her dress.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mom!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here you are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABBY>
<SIDNEY>
<DIRECTION>
(from the floor)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello Abby. You're lovely. And I'm not looking up your skirt.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Kieran is busting a gut not to laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been looking for you all over the place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABBY>
<ANDREW_S_VOICE_OFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Abby? Where are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDREW_S_VOICE_OFF>
<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm in here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABBY>
<DIRECTION>
Andrew pops his head in.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're bringing the car around.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDREW>
<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABBY>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're leaving?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Darling, I'm exhausted. I had such a marvelous time. Those dancers were so beautiful. But weddings are really for young people. I thought we'd just sneak off and not make a big scene.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABBY>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You could make a little scene.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And here I am making it. Andrew and I are going to Washington in the morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABBY>
<KYM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are you going to Washington?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYM>
<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the mother of all fund raisers at American. I thought I mentioned it. We're going to stay on about a week - there are lots of meetings. I thought since you two are going away soon...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Kym)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and I'm sure you don't want any grown ups around checking up on you...Will you still be here when I get back?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Kym doesn't say anything.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about our post-nuptial wedding gossip reconnaissance, Mom?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, can you come by early?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABBY>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Um...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course you don't want to do that. It's your wedding night. You don't want to get up early. I have to get Andrew organized. He's hopeless. And we'll be back in a bit. It was such a lovely wedding, darling.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She bends in for a kiss.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait! I want my mother and my sister!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rachel...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABBY>
<DIRECTION>
Rachel wraps one arm around Kym's neck and the other round her mother and hugs them both to her. She has her eyes open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They have their eyes open. They are stiff as boards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rachel stops hugging and looks from one to the other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her mom and sister look at her and each other. Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you call me every day about...?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She pats Rachel's tummy.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Of course.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABBY>
<SIDNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goodbye Abby.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIDNEY>
<ABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good bye, Son-in-law.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Kym and Rachel watch their mother leave the room.
</DIRECTION>
<SIDNEY>
<DIRECTION>
(horrified)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I saw your mother's underwear.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Kym sees Abby and Andrew crossing the front porch through the window.
</DIRECTION>
<KYM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't find my cigarettes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYM>
<DIRECTION>
Kym moves quickly from the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUCHMAN FOYER. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kym is heading for the front door, when Paul breaks away from a group of guests having coffee in the dining room and nabs her, pulling her into a conversation with a WEDDING GUEST.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kymmie. Speak of the devil. You remember Susanna Galeano.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<KYM>
<DIRECTION>
(she doesn't)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYM>
<SUSANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi Kym.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSANNA>
<DIRECTION>
Kym is looking out the dining room window between Paul and Susanna -- she spots Abby and Andrew walking down the driveway towards the VALETS at the street.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Susanna has a public relations firm and she just lost one of her assistants.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<SUSANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Weddings. They're an epidemic. Your father gave me my start about a hundred years ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSANNA>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no. Hardly. Well...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<SUSANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We could definitely use an extra body right about now. Have you ever thought about Public Relations?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSANNA>
<KYM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The public is kind of afraid of me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYM>
<DIRECTION>
Susanna and Paul laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The firm is opening an office right here in town, just in time for the holidays. You could stay right here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<SUSANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you ever thought about P.R. Kym?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSANNA>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Logistically it's just a dream. You could stay in your old room. I could chauffeur you around. You wouldn't have to worry about rent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<KYM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you already talked to Carol about me staying here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYM>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course. She's fine about it. You could stay in your old room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<SUSANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you give me a call on Monday, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She hands Kym a business card and kisses Paul on the cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goodbye Paul. It was just beautiful. Bye Kym.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Suzy's first rate. P.R. can be fascinating.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<KYM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You always said it was stupid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYM>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I meant stupid. Do you want me to hold that for you? You've got no pockets.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<KYM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got it. Thanks, Dad. I'll be right back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYM>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FRONT PORCH. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the edge of the porch Kym sees Abby standing in the moonlight at the front of the driveway with Andrew, waiting for their car. Kym pauses. Abby turns her head slightly in Kym's direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kym, in the half dark, watches her mother.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Abby does not move a muscle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kym steps off the porch. The valet pulls up in the car, jumps out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Abby fixes her gaze on Andrew as he opens the door for her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They drive off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON KYM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BUCHMAN BACKYARD. MORNING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Absolute End of a Wedding. The place is a gorgeous mess of wedding detritus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tent looks so lonely. A weary caterer packs away his trays.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kieran is talking and smoking with Sidney at the end of the lawn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ETHAN'S ROOM. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A freshly scrubbed Kym, in her own clothes, takes a moment in Ethan's room. She collects a few snapshots of her sister and brother and stuffs them in her shoulder bag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Kym approaches the stairs, Emma staggers into the hallway, bleary-eyed. She is in her underwear, heading for the bathroom. She stops at the sight of Kym. They stare at each other. Emma gives a tiny wave. Kym responds, heads down the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUCHMAN STAIRWAY. DAY. Kym slipping quietly downstairs. She moves to collect her weird mish-mash of bags waiting by the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kieran is there.
</DIRECTION>
<KYM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oof. You scared me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYM>
<KIERAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Making a break for it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIERAN>
<KYM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. I have to go. I was coming to find you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYM>
<KIERAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't have to slip away without making any noise, you know? I like noise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIERAN>
<KYM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was coming to find you. My ride's outside.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYM>
<KIERAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Okay...If you need anything...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIERAN>
<KYM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I need to post bond?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Kieran hands Kym a folded piece of paper.
</DIRECTION>
<KIERAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. If you ever need anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIERAN>
<KYM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Kieran.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYM>
<KIERAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe you'll come visit me in Hawaii?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIERAN>
<KYM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That would be nice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYM>
<DIRECTION>
He smiles, kisses her, tenderly. She hugs him fiercely.
</DIRECTION>
<KYM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to go. Bye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYM>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FRONT PORCH. DAY. Kym looks back in through the window, sees her father awake, in his robe, tired, gamely tidying.
</DIRECTION>
<KYM>
<DIRECTION>
(unbelievably softly and tenderly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYM>
<DIRECTION>
Carol comes up behind Paul, envelopes him in a gentle bear hug.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BUCHMAN DRIVEWAY. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A `98 maroon CAMRY is idling in the circular driveway out front, exhaust vaporizing against the chilly morning air. A cute two-year-old girl is visible in a carseat and Rosa, the staff nurse from Kym's halfway house, is at the wheel. The car radio plays quietly as Kym opens the passenger door, wiggling her finger at the little girl. Like a ghost, Rachel appears on the porch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kym jumps a little.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sisters lock eyes. Kym looks pained. Paul is still moving around in there. She wants to go. Rachel floats down the porch stairs and joins her sister at the car. She takes in Rosa who meets Rachel's look with a nod.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSA>

<KYM>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you tell Dad?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYM>
<DIRECTION>
Rachel nods. Kym is crying.
</DIRECTION>
<KYM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love your baby!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYM>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
Rachel hugs her sister fiercely. Kym gets into the passenger seat but leaves the car door open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rachel smiles her huge, luminous smile. Kym shuts the car door and rolls down the window.
</DIRECTION>
<KYM>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bye!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYM>
<DIRECTION>
Rachel mouths "Bye" and gives a little wave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car pulls out of the driveway, Carol watching it go from the dining room window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
