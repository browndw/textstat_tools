</ANTHONY>
<DIGNAN>

	Mr. Langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation. CPR. I've never said this before, but frankly I thought Anthony was dead. The veins in his face were all sticking out. His skin was blue. He truly did look dead.
	</DIALOGUE>

<ANTHONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	After that my parents never let me go to Dignan's again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTHONY>
<DIGNAN>

	They blamed my family for everything. They always said Mr. Langston saved Anthony's life.

</DIGNAN>

Dignan stares wistfully across the pool. Anthony looks at him for a minute.

Anthony puts his hands in his pockets. Looks out at the highway.

	</DIALOGUE>
</DIGNAN>
<DIRECTION>
Anthony gets up and walks to the bathroom. He shuts the door. Dignan follows him over to the sink and sits on the counter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIGNAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, let's face it. Bob was dead weight. We're a lot better off without him.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But who could expect it? Just like that. Steals the fucking car. What kind of person pulls that --
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIGNAN>
<DIRECTION>
Anthony opens the door and walks out.
</DIRECTION>
<ANTHONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bob didn't steal the car. He told me he was going. He had to go help his brother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTHONY>
<DIRECTION>
Anthony sits back down on the bed. Dignan's shocked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIGNAN>

<ANTHONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I didn't do it, did I?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTHONY>
<DIGNAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So when you were saying Bob's at the store and acting real suprised, that was just an act. You were just --
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIGNAN>
<ANTHONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bob went to help his brother. I understand that and I can't help it if you don't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTHONY>
<DIGNAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I understand that if I had a few more friends like you and Bob I'd be dead.

Anthony and Dignan are sitting at a booth. Anthony's got a roadmap spread out on the table. There's a long silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIGNAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you'd gone with Bob you'd probably be in Weatherford by now. Of course I'd be here frantically worrying thinking you must of got kidnapped.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIGNAN>
<ANTHONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, Dignan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTHONY>
<DIGNAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, the world is a little bit colder today.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIGNAN>
<DIRECTION>
Anthony sits there thinking for a second, stating into space. Then he looks back at his map. He draws some lines in two different colors of felt tip pens.
</DIRECTION>
<ANTHONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to look at the map?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTHONY>
<DIRECTION>
Pause. Dignan kind of looks at the map, without leaning forward. Anthony turns the map more in Dignan's direction. Dignan leans forward, looking.
</DIRECTION>
<ANTHONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See. Here's where we are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTHONY>

They look at the map for a minute. Dignan looks out the window.

EXT/INT. MOTEL/TOWN. DAY

Anthony runs down the sidewalk, cuts across the street, and goes around the side of the motel. He pulls off his jacket as he goes up the stairs. He spots Inez's cart. He walks over to the room she's cleaning. She's in there making the bed. Anthony closes the door and grabs her by her belt. She's laughing and he pushes her onto the bed. He unbuttons her dress. She jerks a sheet out of the way. It swings in the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then we see Anthony and Inez walking down the sidewalk. He's got one arm wrapped tight around her shoulders and she's got hers around his waist. They're talking while they walk, going past people in the town.
</DIRECTION>

They watch each other walking reflected in a window.

Anthony, Dignan, and Inez are drinking beers with limes and salt. The mood is good and they're getting drunk. Anthony and Inez dance. Then Dignan and Inez. Mexican-style, stomping their feet and clapping. There's a scruffy dog in the bar and he barks at the dancers. Anthony kisses Inez and they whisper to each other. Dignan orders another beer and moves over to the pool table. A skinny Mexican MAN puts his arm around Dignan's shoulder. He's drunk and slurring his words. So's Dignan.

The bathroom is very small with one bare light bulb. Dignan stands at the urinal, muttering to himself.

INT. MOTEL ROOM. NIGHT

Dignan's sitting in bed, watching TV. He's got a fat lip and a big bruise over his eye. Anthony's sitting in a chair beside him. Inez brings over a glass of water and some ice in a washcloth. She gives the ice to Dignan for his eye. She puts the glass of water on the nightstand where there's some fast food layed out for Dignan: burger, fries, an apple pie. Inez goes into the bathroom, closes the door, and turns on the water. Anthony's sitting there with his hands clasped, not looking at the TV.

</ANTHONY>
<ANTHONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shh.

Pause. Dignan runs at the car and kicks the door as hard as he can. It makes a big dent. He runs down the shoulder and grabs a big rock. He runs at the car and smashes the rock through the windshield. He stands still. He turns to Anthony. He walks back over to him, yelling.

Kumar suddenly stands up and unbuttons his shirt. He throws it on the bed. He undoes his trousers and takes them off. Anthony looks at Dignan. Kumar takes off his socks, then his shorts. He is naked. He walks over to his dresser and takes out a small satchell. He looks around the room. Right at Anthony. He walks quickly toward him. Anthony gets nervous. Kumar grabs Anthony's shoulder and lifts him up a little. He pulls a towel out from underneath Anthony. He puts his hand on Dignan's shoulder as he walks to the door, into the hall.

Anthony and Mr. Henry are jogging along railroad tracks in the warehouse district. Anthony wears a blue T-shirt and shorts.

They've both got smooth running styles, though every twenty yards or so Mr. Henry rolls his shoulders and gives a quick flurry of punches. An older woman rides a bicycle across the tracks. She's not pretty, but she's got a strong face. Pioneer stock.

Anthony takes a deep breath. Mr. Henry massages Anthony's shoulders. He takes Anthony's head in his arms and does a quick pull to one side: cracks his neck. Then the other side.

Anthony and Bob laugh. Dignan takes another huge bite.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I might have to have another one of these.

CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dignan in handcuffs behind a chain link fence. He's standing in line with some other inmates.
</DIRECTION>
<DIGNAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks for coming.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIGNAN>
<DIRECTION>
Anthony nods. They stand there in silence. The line moves forward a few steps. Anthony and Bob walk with Dignan on the other side of the fence. The line stops. Pause.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dignan leans toward the fence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIGNAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIGNAN>
<DIRECTION>
He motions for them to come closer to the fence. He whispers:
</DIRECTION>
<DIGNAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I may have found a way out of here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIGNAN>
<ANTHONY>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're kidding.

</ANTHONY>
<DIRECTION>
The line starts moving. Anthony and Bob walk with Dignan on the other side of the fence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIGNAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When we go through the next gate you'll have 30 seconds to take out the tower guard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIGNAN>
<ANTHONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?

</ANTHONY>
<DIGNAN>

<DIRECTION>
The line starts moving faster.
</DIRECTION>
<DIGNAN>

</DIGNAN>
<BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold on --

	Wait a second --

</BOB>
<DIGNAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIGNAN>
<DIRECTION>
Anthony and Bob look all around in a panic. They look to Dignan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dignan shuffles along with the rest of the inmates. He looks at Anthony and Bob. He smiles. He shrugs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIGNAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So long.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIGNAN>
<DIRECTION>
Bob and Anthony slowly half-smile. They wave to Dignan as the line of inmates turns away. Anthony looks to Bob. Bob smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The line of inmates stops about fifty feet away. Dignan looks back. Anthony looks at him. Dignan's expression has changed. He wasn't expecting them to see it. His eyes look cold. Anthony puts his hand on the fence. Dignan turns and the line of inmates disappears into the cell block.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anthony stands there in silence.. He lets go of the fence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks with Bob down the long path in the cold air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT.
</DIRECTION>
