:SC: I Walked with a Zombie
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The RKO trademark FADES OUT, to reveal a road lined with palm trees, spectrally long and straight like a vista in a Dali painting. Along this road and from a far distance two tiny figures advance toward the camera. Over this scene the TITLE and CREDITS are SUPERIMPOSED. The two figures continue to advance, growing more discernible all the time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the credits FADE, the two human figures advancing along the road are more clearly discernible. Although they are not close enough to distinguish their faces, it can be seen that one of them is an enormously tall, cadaverous negro, clothed only by ragged, tight-fitting trousers and that the other is nurse, dressed in crisp white uniform and cap, with a dark cloak over her shoulders.

CLOSE SHOT of Mr. Richard Brindsley Wilkens, V.C. He is a small, sharp-featured, precise little man with pincenez glasses, dressed in a dark business suit. One of the coat sleeves is empty. The explanation for the missing arm can be found in his coat lapel: the ribbon of the Victoria Cross. His age indicates that he won it in the last war. He has a tablet in front of him and as he speaks, marks down the answers to his questions.

MONTAGE OF SHIPS

A great Canadian luxury liner, a boat like the Empress of Canada, proceeds across the screen from left to right. Another ship, a smaller passenger steamer, going in the same direction, takes her place as she DISSOLVES OFF; then a freighter, and finally a small white-hulled trading schooner comes onto the screen.

	Boats grow smaller to reach out-of the-way ports. Judging by the boats that took me to St. Sebastian -- it's far away and hard to get to.

EXT. SCHOONER -- WHEEL -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two men stand by the wheel of the schooner, their faces lit by the light from the binnacle. Behind them the wake of the boat creams out, white and phosphorescent. One of the men is obviously the skipper of the boat, dressed in sloppy white ducks, unshaven and with an officer's battered cap on his head. The other is a slim, tall man dressed in flannel slacks and a light tweed coat.

	The man for whom I'd come to work -- Mr. Holland -- boarded the schooner at Gonave. He was pointed out to me, and he must have known who I was -- yet he never spoke to me. He seemed quiet and aloof.

EXT. VILLAGE OF ST. SEBASTIAN -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
St. Sebastian is a drab little West Indian village. The shacks and houses of wood, lath and plaster seem to be falling apart. Over the doorway of one of the buildings -- evidently an administrative office -- hangs an American flag, indicating the government of the island. The hard-packed dirt in the roadway is overgrown with weeds. Everywhere, and moving indolently, are the little, badly nourished negroes, some of them tending stalls and sidewalk vending booths, others walking idly. Betsy, followed by a black sailor with her suitcases, comes down the gangway. Parallel to this gangway is another.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Up the second gangway, in file, black stevedores with bundles of sugar cane and small bales of sisal hemp on their heads, go up to the boat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the dock, Betsy makes her way through a group of clamorous children, vendors and beggars. As the black sailor puts her luggage into an umbrella-topped surrey drawn by a gaunt mule, she stops, delighted, before a great basket filled with enormous white flowers. The man seated beside the basket seems to be asleep, his face hidden by the drooping brim of a straw hat. Betsy picks up one of the blooms, smells it and then looks at the vendor.

EXT. ROAD TO FORT HOLLAND -- DAY -- (PROCESS)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An umbrella-topped surrey, drawn by a gaunt mule and piloted by an old coachman in dirty white singlet, a top hat with a cockade on his graying hair, is making its way along a dusty road between fields of sugar cane. In the distance, the sea is visible and above it the great billowing white clouds of the Caribbean. Betsy, seated on the back seat of the carriage, is bending forward to listen to the old man.

EXT. FORT HOLLAND -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The jugheaded mule slowly pulls the carriage into the scene. This beast comes to a somnolent stop without the coachman so much as touching the reins. As the man climbs down and starts to take the luggage out of the carriage, Betsy looks through the wrought-iron gate into the garden.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fort Holland is a one-story house built around the garden, with low covered porches to give shade and breezeway. At the open end of the U is a great gate much like the wrought-iron gates of New Orleans. Through this Betsy can see the garden and its profusion of verdure: azalea, bougainvillea, roses -- much like California planting; no exotic orchids or man eating Venus Jugs -- just ordinary, pretty, semi-tropic flowers and shrubs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The separate rooms are open to the garden, but have jalousies of thin wood to give privacy when needed. At one corner stands a big, stone tower, obviously a relic of some previous building. The walls of the house have been built right up to and around the tower so that it has become part of the building itself. On the garden side of the tower is the fountain. The most outstanding feature of this spring or fountain, which flows from a crevice in the stones of the tower, is that instead of falling directly into the cistern it falls first onto the shoulders of the enormous teakwood figurehead of St. Sebastian. From the shoulders of the saint it drips down in two runnels over his breast. The wooden breast of the statue is pierced with six long iron arrows. The face is weathered and black. Only a few bits of white paint still cling to the halo above his head. Betsy and the coachman come up to the grillwork of the gate. Betsy looks around the garden, while the old coachman reaches up and pulls a bell rope suspended from the gate. As the bell begins to ring, he pushes the gate open. Betsy walks through.

INT. BETSY'S ROOM -- NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
This is a small but lovely room with white plastered walls. As in the rest of the house, the furniture is not the usual tropical porch furniture, but is neat, serviceable furnishings such as an well-to-do family established for a long time in any given place would acquire. There is a nice four-poster bed with pineapple carving, a dressing table with a little Chippendale chair before it, and a maple rocker so old it has turned a hard, brown color that softly reflects the highlights in the room. On the wall is a little mirror in a carved Spanish frame. There are no pictures or other ornaments. A woven grass rug lies on the floor. Betsy is seated before the dressing table, putting the last touches to her hair. She has changed her clothes and is wearing a simple, linen dress. There is a discreet rap on the jalousied door which separates the room from the garden. Betsy crosses the room and opens the door. A colored man in a butler's white jacket stands there. This is Clement.

Betsy and Clement pass the fountain. The figure of St. Sebastian gleams wetly in the rays of the candlelight. On the covered porch in front of the living room, a dinner service has been set out on a long mahogany table. As she comes forward, Betsy sees a handsome young man waiting for her. This is Wesley Rand. The table by which he stands is set for two and lit by candelabra in great glass hurricane lamps. The table is laid with white linen, and the candlelight gleams on silver and cut-glass arranged in the most formal manner. The table itself is a beautiful mahogany structure with elaborate carving, and the four chairs which surround it are massive Victorian pieces. A fifth chair stands by the wall. Rand steps down into the garden and extends his hand to Betsy.

INT. BETSY'S ROOM -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Betsy, dressed in a trim negligee and slippers, is getting ready for the night. She plumps up the cushion, tests the softness of the mattress and then, yawning, turns out the Aladdin kerosene lamp which lights the room. Level rays of moonlight filter through the rattan blinds into the room. Betsy crosses the room and peers out through the rattan strips into the garden.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE GARDEN -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AS BETSY SEES IT. Lights are on in the living room. This light, barred and diffused by the strip-blinds, softly illuminates the garden. The black shadows of trees and shrubbery loom over the paths. Through these shadows a woman, dressed in filmy white, walks stiffly, her arms hanging immobile, close to her slim body. She is blonde and as far as the light will reveal, she seems beautiful. She makes the circuit of the garden, pacing slowly along the paths. Betsy watches her. Then, from the living room, a man's voice calls out to her.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLAND_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jessica.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLAND_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The woman at once turns toward the living room, mounts the porch and enters through a door held open for her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BETSY'S ROOM -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Betsy turns back into the room. She has crossed over to the bed and is removing her negligee when the sound of hesitant notes on the piano attract her attention. In her nightgown she goes back to the window and peers through the cracks between the laths.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. A CORNER OF THE LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From where she stands, Betsy can see the big, square, rosewood piano. A lamp had been lit beside it and the light from this lamp falls on the blonde hair and gleaming shoulders of the woman who had walked in the garden. Her face cannot be seen. Her fingers move strangely over the keyboard, now and again striking a hesitant note, but making no music, only an occasional dissonance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BETSY'S ROOM -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Betsy, still watching through the slit in the jalousie, endeavors to get a better view of the living room. She changes her position and looks out again through the blinds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ANOTHER CORNER OF THE LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As seen from Betsy's NEW ANGLE. Paul Holland is seated in a low armchair. His eyes are fixed on the woman at the piano. She continues to strike odd notes on the piano.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BETSY'S ROOM -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Betsy leaves the window, crosses to the bed and lies down. Then, sighing, she makes herself comfortable on the pillow, settling herself for sleep. Outside the nightjars whistle softly, the cicadas twitter and the Hammer tree frogs make drowsy, somnolent little croaks: it is a tropic lullaby of bird, batrachian and insect sound. The faint, groping notes on the piano continue.

EXT. THE FIGURE OF ST. SEBASTIAN -- NIGHT -- (MOONLIGHT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the moonlight, the pin-cushioned figure of St. Sebastian broods over the dark water in the cistern. Above the constant sound of the water flowing over the saint's shoulders can be heard the sound of a woman crying, mournfully and as if from deep-seated sadness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BETSY'S ROOM -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Betsy is asleep. The sound of the woman's weeping is persistent in the room. Finally, it has its effect. The young nurse stirs restlessly, then wakes. She listens, gets up, then listens again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE TOWER DOOR -- NIGHT -- (MOONLIGHT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BETSY'S ROOM -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is obvious to her this piteous keening comes from the direction of the tower. It is in this direction she had seen Holland carry the tray of food to her patient. She pulls on her slippers and negligee and leaves the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE FIGURE OF ST. SEBASTIAN -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Betsy crosses in front of the fountain and goes to the small postern door of heavy, iron-bound oaks which leads into the ruin. The sound of weeping continues. She tries the door. It opens and she goes in, leaving it open behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE GROUND FLOOR OF THE TOWER -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Betsy comes hesitantly in and looks around her. She can still hear the sound of a woman's crying. It seems to come from above her. A circling flight of shallow stone steps lead upward into the dark. To one side of them, but almost hidden from her in the darkness, is another door leading back into the house. She hesitates a moment and then, slowly, begins to climb the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TOWER -- SECOND FLOOR -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Betsy comes up to the level of the second floor. It is in pitch blackness. High above her is a narrow slit through which a single shaft of white moonlight drives sharply into the well-like darkness of the room. Very slowly, almost as if feeling her way on the stone floor with her slippered feet, she crosses the room. Then, one hand groping along the rough, stone wall, she begins to circle the room, searching for some doorway, or an ascending flight of stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Above her in the massive rafters of the tower, bats stir and squeak. One bat, dropping from his perch, sweeps past her with a rushing of air against the taut membranes of his wings, then flies laboriously up and out through the narrow slit high in the wall. Betsy stands stock still, frightened. Then she resumes her groping progress. A rat squeals and slithers across the floor. Again she stops. Then, more as a request for guidance than as a cry for help, she calls out softly.
</DIRECTION>
<BETSY>
<DIRECTION>
(calling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mrs. Holland! Mrs. Holland!

A white-robed female figure comes out from under the stairs, walking slowly, her movements drift-like as if walking in deep sleep. She begins slowly to climb the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TOWER -- SECOND FLOOR -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Betsy is still groping her way around the circling walls of the tower. The shaft of moonlight strikes down between her and the stairs. Through it she sees the drifting, diaphanous whiteness of the other woman as she comes up from the dark stairwell.
</DIRECTION>
<BETSY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mrs. Holland?

The white woman keeps walking toward her with the same entrance tread. Betsy takes a step forward to meet her. The two women come together in such a way that the white-clad woman stops directly in the shaft of moonlight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP of Jessica. This is the face of the dead; bloodless, cold-lidded, eyes open and unseeing, washed white with the pallor of the moonlight, framed in lank, lifeless tresses of blonde hair.

Without expression, Jessica moves toward her.

MED. CLOSE SHOT -- Jessica and Betsy. Jessica comes toward Betsy, who takes a step back. They are out of the moonlight now, but the pale face of the woman seems to glow in the darkness. She keeps advancing toward Betsy. Betsy screams -- shrill and piercing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE RAFTERS OF THE TOWER -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

Betsy's cry echoes back and forth between the stone walls of the tower. The bats hanging from the rafters are roused and begin to fly, squeaking and mewling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TOWER -- SECOND FLOOR -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The flight of bats wheels and banks around the figures of the two women. Betsy screams wordlessly and the shrill, piercing sound of her outcry lances back at her from the echoing walls.

CLOSEUP of Betsy. Desperately frightened, her face agonized, she screams again, pressing her loosely clenched fists against the sides of her mouth.

Single file, the bats sweep out one by one through the loophole high up in the wall of the tower. Betsy's scream continues to echo.

Jessica still continues to walk toward Betsy. Betsy retreats from her, backs onto the stone stairs leading to the slit in the wall. She orients herself quickly; starts to back up this narrow flight of steps.

INT. TOWER STAIRWELL -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holland running up the steps of the tower. He is pulling a light bathrobe over his pajamas and carrying a flashlight in his hand. Behind him come Clement and a pretty, little negro maid, Alma. Clement has dressed hurriedly. He is barefooted; has on his trousers and a shirt, which is not tucked in at the waistband. Alma, also barefooted, has on a thick, white cotton nightgown, a little bit too big for her. Clement carries a lighted kerosene lamp in his hand.

Clement precedes Betsy and Holland down the stairs, holding the lantern high to give them light. At the foot of the stairs he steps aside, standing near the door of Jessica's bedroom. Betsy and Holland go outside to the garden. Clement is about to follow them when the door to Jessica's bedroom opens a few inches. Alma puts her head out cautiously.

Clement, the lantern still in his hand, passes close behind them. For a moment they turn and look at his black, still face, underlit by the rays of the lantern.

INT. FORT HOLLAND LIVING ROOM AND OFFICE -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This room is fairly long with jalousied doors and windows like the other rooms in the house. It is tastefully furnished and there is a large square rosewood piano in one corner of the room. The rather formal elegant furniture shows up nicely against the white-washed plaster walls. At one end is a raised portion with a low railing surrounding it. Here Holland has his office.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a trestle table with a straight chair behind it, typewriter on a stand, and a small wooden filing cabinet with an old-fashioned letter-press on top of it. There is a surveyor's map of the plantation on one wall, and on the other a Geodetic Survey chart of the island of St. Sebastian. (For 75c, we can purchase the U.S. Geodetic chart of Anacapa Island, engraved by Whistler, possibly the most beautiful map ever drawn. We can use this for the map of our fictitious island.) Holland is seated at the table with a ledger open before him. He has obviously been working. Betsy sits in a chair drawn up to one corner of the table. She is in her nurse's uniform.

INT. JESSICA'S BEDROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a beautiful woman's bedroom, feminine but with no suggestion of the bagnic; elegant rather than seductive, and reflecting a playful yet sophisticated taste. The furniture is Biedermeier. There is a large bed, a trim chaise lounge, a little slipper chair and in one corner of the room, that hallmark of great vanity, a triple-screen, full-length mirror, also a Biedermeier style. Before it is a tabouret, the surface of which is literally covered with expensive looking perfume bottles and cosmetic jars. Mrs. Holland had evidently taken the tasks of beauty seriously enough to stand up to them. There is one picture in the room. It is Boecklin's "The Isle of the Dead," framed in a narrow frame of dark wood. Near the open window stands a beautiful gilt parlour harp. (Size 22) Behind it, arranged conveniently for playing, is a small Empire chair. There is no other furniture near this arrangement, and the harp, the empty chair and wind-stirred glass curtains give a dual effect of elegance and loneliness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA is FOCUSED on this harp as the scene opens. The glass curtains blown by the wind, steal across the strings bringing forth tinkling notes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA PANS RIGHT to reveal Betsy and Dr. Maxwell at Mrs. Holland's bedside. Dr. Maxwell is a small, neat man with a charming voice and a pleasant but somewhat professional personality. He is dressed in tropical whites and wears a cummerbund. Alma is removing the breakfast tray and, as she passes Betsy on her way to the door, she makes a little curtsey. Mrs. Holland is lying back against the pillows on her bed in a semi-reclining position.

In the daylight her emaciated, pale face and great, empty eyes are pitiful but no longer frightening.

	To put it simply: Mrs. Holland had one of those high fevers often found with our tropical maladies. We might say that portions of the spinal cord and certain lobes of the mind were burned out by this fever. The result is what you see -- a woman bereft of will power, unable to speak or even to act by herself. She will obey simple commands.

He crosses the room and clasps shut the black leather bag in which he carries his medicine kit. Betsy rises and walks over to him.

Betsy nods and then turns back into the room. She walks up to the bed and stands looking at Jessica, then down at the list of typewritten instructions. Evidently the list calls for her to carry out some detail of the regime, for she puts it down and starts out of the room in a businesslike fashion.

Betsy turns, as she hears her name, and sees Rand, mounted on a white saddle mule. (The mule is one of those delicate, single footed saddle animals which they breed in Central America and the West Indies, very smart-looking and with good furniture. The saddle should be particularly well-chosen. Most West Indian planters use an English saddle with long stirrups. Sometimes a machete in a leather scabbard hangs from the near side of the saddle.) He maneuvers the mule between a cart and a vendor balancing two baskets on a pole over his shoulders, then brings the animal to a halt beside her.

EXT. STREET CORNER - ST. SEBASTIAN -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Calypso singer with a guitar slung around his shoulder, lounges against the corner of a building, singing to a small audience of loiterers. He has a derby hat in front of him with one or two coins in it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CAFE -- ST. SEBASTIAN -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Around the corner from the Calypso singer is a cafe. On the roadway in front of it, under a tattered awning, two or three tables have been set out. At one of these sit Betsy and Rand. At another, two white planters in work clothing are having a drink of beer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind them, leaning against the wall, stands the proprietor, a Negro in duck trousers and duck coat, with an apron tied around his middle. Betsy has tea in front of her and Rand, a Planter's Punch. As we see them, she is just laughing at something he has said. He is finishing his drink. Rand sets down his glass and gestures to the proprietor.

	There was a family that lived on the isle Of Saint Sebastian a long, long while The head of the family was a Holland man And the younger brother, his name was Rand

Betsy's attention is caught by the song. Rand evidently knows the song, because he begins talking at random, trying to distract her.
</DIRECTION>
<RAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, did I tell you that story about the little mule at the plantation -- the little mule and Clement? Let me tell you. It's one of the funniest stories --

</BETSY>
<DIRECTION>
We hear the guitar music without singing, as the Calypso singer plays a few measures to bridge the first and second verses. Ti-Joseph comes up to the table with Rand's drink. Rand makes a motion to him indicating the corner around which the Calypso singer is standing. Ti-Joseph gets the idea and goes off instantly.

Ti-Joseph comes in and, while the singer goes on with his song, whispers in his ear. The Calypso singer stops immediately. He looks frightened and guilty. Ti-Joseph turns and goes around the corner to his cafe. The Calypso singer addresses one of the people in the little group before him.

EXT. THE CAFE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA IS FOCUSED ON a ragged, barefooted lamplighter. He is lighting one of the crude kerosene street lamps of St. Sebastian with a long taper on the end of the stick. When it finally lights up he lowers the glass chimney with another stick he carries.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the beach comes the sound of a guitar and a man singing. It is very faint, at first, but as it comes closer we can recognize the voice of the Calypso singer and the melody he was singing when Rand interrupted him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA PANS OVER to show Rand and Betsy still sitting in Ti-Joseph's sidewalk cafe. Rand has slumped down in his chair, thoroughly drunk. Ti-Joseph stands, arms folded, leaning in the darker shadows of the wall. Betsy looks off in the direction of the singing, a little anxiously.

There is no movement, no sound from Rand. Betsy looks at him, then looks over at Ti-Joseph. There does not seem to be much help to be had in that direction. Really frightened now, she turns back quickly to the approaching Calypso singer. He never takes his eyes off her, as he walks slowly toward the cafe. There is a strange menace in the way he sings.
</DIRECTION>
<CALYPSO_SINGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Her eyes are empty and she cannot talk And a nurse has come to make her walk. The brothers are lonely and the nurse is young And now you must see that my song is sung.

He stops abruptly. In the silence footsteps are heard, light brisk footsteps coming down the street toward the cafe. The Calypso singer looks away from Betsy for the first time. As Betsy also turns, in great relief, to see who is coming, the Calypso singer moves quickly and silently out of the scene. A middle-aged white woman, handsome and neatly dressed in a suit with a Norfolk jacket, appears in the entrance of the cafe. She glances briefly in the direction which the Calypso singer has taken and then at Betsy and Rand. She smiles in a friendly way at Betsy.

EXT. TERRACE -- DINING TABLE -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a hot, windy night. The bushes in the garden move violently with the gusts of wind. Even protected as they are by the great glass hurricane lamps, the candle flames that light the table are agitated and stir restlessly. Tonight there are four people at dinner, Holland, Rand, Betsy, in a simple print dress, and Jessica, in a lovely evening gown that leaves her shoulders and arms bare. They have finished the first portion of their meal and Clement is taking off the soup plates. Somewhere off in the hills there is the ululating sounds of a great sea conch being blown.
</DIRECTION>
<BETSY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't seem very disturbed by it. I've always thought Voodoo was something to be scared of: the drums sounded in the hills and everybody was frightened.

EXT. THE HOUMFORT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LONG SHOT. The camera is behind Betsy and Jessica as they go toward the Houmfort through the sugar cane. We see this voodoo temple as they go toward it. It is a rickety structure of poles and laths, roofed over with a thin thatch of sugar cane and straw. It forms a sort of rude pergola. In the center of this structure is a small, cubicle hut, made of rough boards but neatly whitewashed. From the rafters of the main structure hang crude chandeliers of tin which give light to the ceremonies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(Please see pages 28 to 31, Life Magazine, December 13, 1937. All the details mentioned above are graphically illustrated,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Near the little hut in the center of the Houmfort, stands an altar covered with a lace tablecloth and littered with a childish jumble of plates, candles, little colored stones and bottles. Before this altar stands the Houngan, the high priest of the voodoo ceremonies, a small, stoop-shouldered man in a worn, white coat and trousers with ragged cuffs. Several mild-looking negroes in white trousers and shirts sit in kitchen chairs on one side of the altar with rada drums between their knees. Grouped around this altar in a loose semicircle are the worshippers, a group of mild-mannered, poorly-but-neatly-dressed negroes. They seem to have made an effort to dress in their best and their best is very poor indeed. As Betsy approaches, she can see familiar faces. As she comes up they turn and look at her. They are not hostile nor greatly surprised; just mildly curious. Leading Jessica by the hand, Betsy takes her place at one end of the semicircle around the altar. Her arrival has in no way interrupted the ceremonies. The Houngan continues to chant before the altar, the rada drums beat and the crowd sings the chorus of the Shango song at the proper intervals. It is all very decorous and decidedly religious in tone. No sooner has Betsy taken her place with the others than the Shango ritual approaches its climax. The Sabreur, a colored man dressed in white shirt and trousers, with a neat dark tie knotted under his collar, comes in, bearing a sabre in his right hand, holding it in stately, almost processional manner. He advances to the altar, strikes it three times and at this signal two colored women dressed in white beguine dresses with square cut necks, an essential part of this religious costume, come forward. One holds a white leghorn chicken and the other carries a white rooster. They come together to the altar and for a moment, the figures of the Houngan, the Sabreur and the two Mam-Lois hide the actual blood sacrifice from us. Only the fact that the drumming and the singing reach a climactic pitch reveal that some Important portion of the ceremony has taken place. Instantly the drumming and the singing stops. A young colored girl jumps up from her seat among the worshippers and begins shivering and quaking, crying out wordlessly. There is a cry from the people.

The Houngan prances forward, followed by the Sabreur. The Houngan holds a little saucer in his hand with some dark liquid at the bottom of it. He dips four fingers into this liquid while the girl quivers and writhes before him in religious ecstasy. He marks her forehead with four strange marks, one with each finger. The Sabreur, crying out the name of Shango, four times, points his sabre to the four directions of the compass. There is an immediate transformation in the girl. Her frenzy ceases. She seems to be filled with a jubilant calm and dances into the cleared space before the altar. Her words are no longer meaningless. They have taken shape and form and, when she speaks, she speaks with great resonance as if her voice came from somewhere other than her own throat. She is possessed by the god, Shango.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One by one, people from among the group of devotees dance into the circle, go up to her and beg for favors. One woman leads a little boy up to her. We hear her words as she calls out to the possessed girl:
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Make him rich, Shango! Make him rich!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The girl lays her fingers on the boy's eyes, and then takes his shoulders and turns him around three times, Evidently this is absolute guarantee of an enormous income tax to be paid at St. Sebastian. The woman and her son retire happily, pleased and grinning. Finally, exhausted, the girl possessed of the god, Shango, sinks to her knees and then falls fainting to the floor. Two colored men come in, carry her away. A great cry rises from the voodoo worshippers.

The drums find a new rhythm. The Houngan retires to one corner of the altar; the Sabreur to the other. Two young girls, their beguine dresses slashed and torn, dance in from either side. This is a wild and an impassioned dance, a dance to Damballa. There is no singing, only an occasional call from the crowd, "Come to us, Damballa!" The dancers reach the climax of their dance and strike a plastic pose before the altar, each kneeling on one knee, their arms held to their breasts, their foreheads butted together. Although not a muscle moves, one can almost feel the tension of these two bodies. One of the rada drummers comes up and crouches down holding a small drum almost under the chins of the two girls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The other drummers stop playing and he begins to beat a quick staccato rhythm that grows faster and faster. In this playing, as in the pose of the girls, there is tremendous tension. By now all cries have ceased. Everyone is silent, waiting. Then suddenly, from behind the closed and curiously painted door of the inner Houmfort, a voice speaks. A voice that is light, pleasant and authoritative.

The Sabreur dances forward, sword in his left hand and a little plate with rice cakes, in his right. He kneels down and places the plate near the door jamb. A line forms at the door. Betsy leading Jessica by the hand takes her place with the rest. She is third in the line of suppliants. She can see the whole procedure. The suppliant places his forehead against the forehead of the god painted on the door, and speaks. The first suppliant is a weary-looking field hand who shuffles to the door and speaks in such a low tone that his words cannot be heard. The second suppliant is an old woman, thin and work-worn. She speaks sincerely and humbly and Betsy, directly behind her, hears her words.

The old woman turns away, comforted -- hopeful. Betsy looks at her. She can see tears in the old woman's eyes. With Jessica's hand in hers, Betsy takes her place at the door. She puts her forehead against the crudely painted forehead of the god. She talks to the door.

The door swings open slowly. The feeble light of the outer Houmfort does not penetrate the darkness of the inner temple. A hand reaches out from the darkness and takes Betsy's hand and draws her in. The Houngan follows Betsy into the temple. The door shuts behind him. Jessica remains outside, standing before the door.

A match flares and a hand brings it forward to light an oil lamp which flares brightly, revealing a little room of whitewashed boards, bare except for a table on which stands a small iron tripod from which an iron pot is suspended. Although there is no fire under the pot, the steam rises from this receptacle and water boils and bubbles in it. It is the Houngan who has lit the lamp and, on the other side of the table is Mrs. Rand. Her face is serious and unsmiling.

Jessica stands patiently where Betsy had left her. The Sabreur and two Mam-Lois stand near her looking at her and talking. We cannot hear what they say. The drumming and the song of joy for the coming of Damballa continue over the scene. Suddenly, as if he had arrived at some decision, the Sabreur, holding his sword stiffly in front of him, starts toward Jessica with little mincing steps.

	Then, almost accidentally, I discovered the secret of how to deal with them. There was a girl with a baby -- again and again I begged her to boil the drinking water. She never would.

Mrs. Rand, in a simple afternoon dress, is seated on the sofa. Before her is a coffee table with a silver tea service. She is engaged in pouring tea. Betsy is beside her helping her. Rand, in working clothes, is in an armchair near the sofa with a highball in his hand. Also seated, and facing Mrs. Rand and Betsy, is Dr. Maxwell and Commissioner Jeffries. The latter is a dignified man of early middle-age. He is dressed in a light business suit. At the window, at the rear of the room, stands Holland, talking with a Priest. As the scene opens, Mrs. Rand fills a teacup and holds it up toward Holland. He comes toward her to pick up the cup, the Priest walking with him. As they walk, Holland speaks:

Although it is broad daylight, the Inner Houmfort is lit with a rush light which burns weakly. The ceremonial pot of boiling water has been removed from the table and, in its place, squatting cross-legged like a tailor, sits the Sabreur. With one hand he holds upright a small, cheaply-made bisque doll, with flaxen hair. It is dressed in a little white slip. From under the table rim, two dark feminine hands come up to put a white robe on the doll. The moment this garment has been draped on the little doll, a rada drum begins to beat softly in a corner of the room.

THE CAMERA DRAWS BACK to reveal that one of the girls who danced in the voodoo ceremony is kneeling before the table. It is her hands which have dressed the doll. There are about five people in the room, including the three drummers. The Sabreur makes magical passes over the doll.

	<DIALOGUE>
	That night, I went to the Houmfort. I kept seeing Jessica's face -- smiling -- smiling because two men hated each other -- because she was beautiful enough to take my family in her hands and break it apart. The drums seemed to be beating in my head. The chanting -- the lights -- everything blurred together. And then I heard a voice, speaking in a sudden silence. My voice. I was possessed. I said that the woman at Fort Holland was evil and that the Houngan must maker her a Zombie.

	Two things had happened, Mrs. Rand. One was that your daughter-in-law had been taken ill with a fever. The other thing -- completely disconnected -- was that you had wished her ill, because she had hurt your sons.

	You were possessed. That is true -- possessed by your subconscious mind. You were in the Houmfort, surrounded by their symbols. To them, nothing worse can happen to a person than to be made into a Zombie. Your subconscious mind used their own words for evil.

<DIRECTION>
From the hills comes the sound of a single conch, loud and thin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA PANS from the group around Mrs. Rand to the tower door. Jessica walks out of it and comes slowly past the fountain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOUMFORT -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA IS FOCUSED ON a little five-and-ten-cent store doll about three inches high. It is dressed in a crude imitation of Jessica's loose, belted, white gown. A thread is tied around it and this thread leads off, taut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA PANS ALONG the thread to show us that the other end of the thread, some twenty feet long, is held by a negro, crouched near the altar. Halfway between this man and the doll, the Sabreur, his sword stuck in the mound before him, straddles the thread, his hands clasped around the thread but not touching it. Carre-Four stands watching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The conch is blowing its strange, magnetic call and the negroes are chanting as they watch the Sabreur and the doll. The Sabreur makes motions as if he were pulling on the thread but still does no touch it. He makes these motions over and over again. The doll moves slowly. Then suddenly stops. The Sabreur's most frantic efforts fail to move it.

</RAND_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
She does not seem to hear but continues walking toward the gate. We hear the sound of running feet. Holland and Betsy run up to Jessica. Holland takes her arm, but she continues to walk forward. He tries to hold her. It is apparent he cannot do so without the use of considerable force.
</DIRECTION>
<BETSY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jessica! Jessica!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETSY>
<DIRECTION>
She pays no attention but continues to move forward toward the gate. Betsy, realizing that is something outside of her previous experiences with the woman, has the presence of mind to run forward and slam shut the great wrought-iron gate. Jessica walks up against the gate and stands there, unable to move any further. They stand and look at her perplexed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOUMFORT -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The doll has stopped moving. The Sabreur is exerting all his force. We can see the sweat soaking his white shirt. The others are chanting, louder now, swaying in rhythm with his pulling movements. The conch is being blown with a more insistent and compelling note. Still, the doll-figure refuses to move. The Sabreur stops. The conches are suddenly silenced.
</DIRECTION>

In this sudden silence, Holland and Jessica look at each other across the motionless figure of Jessica.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA PULLS BACK to show the exterior of the Houmfort. The light is fading. The posts of the Houmfort and the figures of several voodoo worshippers are outlined in silhouette against the darkening sky. A single rada drum is being beaten in light, quick rhythm. Someone sets fire to a heaped-up bonfire of dry leaves. The flames blazing up illuminate the scene more clearly, so that we can see a small group of voodoo adepts squatting on their heels in a ring around the bonfire. Near the bonfire stand Carre-Four and the Sabreur, with the drummer crouched behind them. The Sabreur takes the doll from Carre-Four's hand and holds it a foot or so away from him. The great black hand reaches for it. Again the Sabreur takes the doll away and dances off with mincing steps to a distance of a few yards. Carre-Four lumbers after him, his hand extended. Again, the Sabreur lets him take the doll.

CLOSE SHOT of Carre-Four's hand with the doll upon it. From underneath, the smaller hand of the Sabreur comes in and closes the great black fingers over the little white doll.

INT. MRS. HOLLAND'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is in darkness. In the faint light from the barred windows, we see Betsy sleeping on the chaise lounge. A shadow moves across her face. Through the window, we see the great, cadaverous figure of Carre-Four. His hand closes around the bars, his face presses against them. Then he lets go of the bars and slips out of sight. His figure reappears at the next window. Again, he tries the bars and peers into the room. Again, he vanishes in the darkness. We hear a faint sound from the tower. Betsy wakens. Her eyes go quickly to the bed, where the outline of Jessica's figure reassures her. There is another muffled, dragging sound from the tower. Betsy sits up, listens intently. She gets up and goes toward the door leading into the tower. At the foot of Jessica's bed, she stops to grab up Jessica's white negligee, throwing it around her she continues to the door and opens it slowly and cautiously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE GROUND FLOOR OF THE TOWER -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Betsy steps into the lower tower room. The thick blackness of the place is faintly lit by the open door into Jessica's windowed bedroom. She stands at the foot of the circling stone stairs, straining to see into the darkness above. Overhead, there is a sudden commotion of wings and shrilling - something has disturbed the bats. Very slowly and hesitantly, Betsy moves up a few steps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA PANS UP from Betsy, around the circling walls of the stairs, to where the sharp blade of light from the slit window of the tower strikes across the wall. A big black hand slides down the shaft of light. The CAMERA PANS BACK to Betsy. She can see nothing, but she hears the dry, whispering sound of the hand moving along the wall. She backs down the few steps and across to the tower door leading to the garden.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE GARDEN AT FORT HOLLAND -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Betsy slips out of the tower door. She stands irresolutely by the fountain, watching and listening. She can see nothing in the black patch of the open tower door. She walks slowly into the garden. There is a faint sound behind her. Fearfully, Betsy looks back across her shoulder. She sees a shadow slip into the deeper shadows of the fountain, merge with them. Quickly she moves behind a tall shrub, looks again toward the tower. She sees nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CLOSE SHOT of the fountain shows the surface of the water in the cistern broken by a spreading ring of ripples. Taut with fear, Betsy leaves the shadow of the tall shrub and slips over to a bush nearer the living room porch. As if in answer to this move, a whispering rustle comes from the screen of bamboo against the tower-wing of the house. She stares toward the bamboo. She sees nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CLOSE SHOT of the bamboo shows the leaves trembling slightly. Betsy looks across the empty, defenseless space between herself and the porch steps. Steeling herself, she moves into it, walking with the slowness of nightmare fear, looking from side to side with the slightest possible move of her head. At the foot of the steps, she turns to look back at the bamboo. A distorted shadow slithers out from under the stalks. Her panic released, Betsy runs up the steps, down the shadowy porch to the door of Holland's bedroom.

She flings herself against the door, turns the handle, and runs into the room, closes the door behind her. Into the space before the porch steps moves the great gaunt figure of Carre-Four. This is our first full sight of him in the scene. He is bare to the waist, wearing only a pair of dark, ragged trousers. He starts up the steps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PORCH -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Betsy comes out of the door to Holland's bedroom, followed by Holland who has put on a robe. In a CLOSE SHOT, we see the shock that springs into their two faces as they see Carre Four facing them across the length of the porch, moving toward them, a single slow step at a time. As Carre-Four sees Betsy's white-clad figure, his hands come up slowly from his sides.

Slowly, the giant figure obeys. Carre-Four turns to face her. His hands relax, his arms fall to his sides again. In his blind fashion, Carre-Four moves back across the porch, turns and goes down the steps to the garden. Holland, who has been watching this transfixed, starts after him.

EXT. GARDEN -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

SHOOTING TOWARD the gates from behind Rand where he still sits at the table. Jessica, dressed in a white nightgown, comes slowly out of the tower and moves toward the gates. Rand watches her. The gate stops her progress.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE HOUMFORT -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The doll has stopped despite the frenzied efforts of the Sabreur and the wild chanting of the voodoo adepts. Nothing can make it move again. There is a whispered consultation between the Sabreur and the Houngan. The Houngan lifts his hand and the drums begin to beat a light rapid rhythm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Sabreur dances toward the doll, making a menacing move with his saber. When he reaches the little image, he puts the point of his saber in the ground and draws from his bodkin, a long needle. With one swift movement, he stabs this through the doll's back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GARDEN -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As seen from Rand's ANGLE. He rises slowly, drains the liquor in his glass, walks forward to where Jessica stands at the gate. He looks at her for a long moment and then, as if a resolve had formed in his mind, goes to the statue of St. Sebastian, takes hold of one of the iron arrows. He tugs at it, but it refuses to come free. He puts his foot up on the wooden breast of the statue and gives a hard pull. The long, iron arrow comes out in his hand. With this in his hand, he walks to where Jessica stands. He pulls back the latch bar and throws the gates wide open. Jessica moves out into the darkness. Rand follows her.

The kettle of water, without a fire, is still boiling. The CAMERA MOVES AROUND the room to show that it is empty. Then MOVES UP ON a small shelf before which a candle is burning. On this shelf, a few inches above the candle flame, stands the cheap little doll dressed like Jessica, with the needle in its back. Suddenly, the doll falls forward on its face.

Rand carrying Jessica's dead body in his arm, comes down to the sand.

The surf. Rand reverently places the body in the lapping water of the surf. The backward drag of an outgoing wave draws it silently away from him. He watches it go.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A returning wave, tall and forward curving, upthrusts the body of Jessica so that we see it in the semi-transparency of the wave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. CLOSE SHOT of Rand. The body comes floating to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rand carries the body a little further into the surf so that the waves when they come in flow past his knees. Again, the outsurge takes the body away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A returning wave brings Jessica's body back again. (There is a famous painting by Boecklin, called "And the Sea Gave Up its Dead" which should somewhat influence the composition of this scene.)
</DIRECTION>

MED. CLOSE SHOT -- Rand. He walks forward to secure the returning body. This time, he picks it up in his arms and starts wading forward.

Rand is walking forward with the body in his arms. The sea is up to his hips. The outgoing surge tugs at him. He struggles to regain his footing, misses and is drawn out to sea.

MED. LONG SHOT. This is a closer shot of the scene and identifies the lights. There are torches held in the hands of black fisherman, up to their knees in water, spearing flounders by torch light.

EXT. SEA -- NIGHT -- (PROCESS)

<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP -- flounder fisherman. He is moving slowly through the shallow water his spear raised. Suddenly, he makes a darting strike with his spear. With a cry of triumph, he holds aloft a struggling flounder. He disengages it from the spear and puts it into the sack slung from his belt.

<DIRECTION>
MED. CLOSE SHOT -- another fisherman. He, too, is moving stealthily forward, spear poised, torch held low. Something on the surface of the water near-by attracts his attention and he lifts up his torch, the periphery of the light widening as he holds it aloft. The widening light reveals the dead body of Jessica afloat on the surface of the water, pallid and dreamlike, her wet, white garments clinging like cerements. The fisherman looks for a moment at the body and then calls off to one of the other fishermen.

LONG SHOT -- flounder fishermen, their lights all converging on a central light.

MED. CLOSE SHOT. A group of flounder fishermen come out onto the land. They are carrying the bodies of Jessica and Rand. They start in the direction of Fort Holland.

EXT. GATES AT FORT HOLLAND -- NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
The fishermen come in bearing their tragic burdens. Rand's body is carried on the shoulders of four fishermen. Behind walks Carre-Four and in his gigantic arms is the body of Jessica; her wet hair and garments dripping from the great arms of the still-living Zombie. The upheld torches and spears of the fishermen give a weird, processional feeling to the group.

Holland, Betsy and Mrs. Rand stand watching the fishermen bringing in the bodies of the dead. Across the garden from the fountain stands the little group of house servants also watching. The procession passes the fountain of St. Sebastian and the CAMERA GOES IN to show the glistening sad face of the saint.

EXT. STREET CORNER -- OTTOWA -- DAY

The CAMERA, as in the first portion of the script, PANS DOWN the sign, pausing for a moment at the firm name of the Parrish & Burden Sugar Company. Then it CONTINUES ITS DOWNWARD MOVEMENT to disclose a portion of the street itself, In the falling snow Betsy is standing with her back to the camera, looking up at the sign.

	It was a sad time at Fort Holland. Mother Rand was completely broken by the tragedy. But she's a woman of courage. She's begun to build up her life again at St. Sebastian -- It's a good life and a full one. As for Paul and me -- it wasn't a simple problem for either of us.

A CLOSER SHOT of Betsy as she stands waiting. She is dressed in a fur-collared coat and has a little round fur cap on her head. She looks very attractive and very happy. The door of the office opens and Paul Holland comes out, muffling up his overcoat. Betsy takes a half step to meet him. He takes her arm with a well-used and familiar gesture.

	Sorry to keep you waiting, darling! I thought I'd never get away. Invoices and stock lists piling up all day long. The balmy tropics were never like this.
