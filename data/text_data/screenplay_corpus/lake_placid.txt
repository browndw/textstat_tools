	Well, he was very ill and he refused to go see a doctor and well... I think he had Alzheimer's, he would be coherent one day, incoherent the next and one coherent day, he asked me to end his suffering. I wouldn't do it but he kept insisting and insisting and deteriorating till the point the only cognitive thing he could really do was that I finish him off. Finally I just gave in and hit him on the head with a skillet then buried him under the bulkhead.

It hits Kelly and she screams, a blood-curdling scream, as the HEAD hits the floor of the boat with a HEAVY THUD. Kelly rears back, still screaming, and belts Keough in the shoulder.

More RUSTLING, it's not just the sound of dense urine against leaves, he stops... something's out there in the darkness. Quiet. He starts up for a second, STOPS QUICKLY, and we HEAR it for sure.

And Keough has the boat to him as Hector breaks surface.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And they quickly pull Hector on board, all attention is on Hector as they lean over to rescue him. On the far right... two eyes... moving closer to the oblivious rescuers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly moving in, everybody is so preoccupied with Hector, Deputy Burke, at the end of the boat, is leaning way over to see Hector. If only he knew what he's not seeing. The eyes come closer. They're now in the water right below Burke's head. How can he not see it? A beat. Another beat. Then... suddenly, a mouth, a dragon, teeth, something, flashes from the water-- snap. And Deputy Burke's head is simply gone as his limp body hangs over the boat. Kelly screams in horror.

In a microsecond, Burke's head and life are both gone. OFF their stunned faces, as Kelly continues to scream we:

And he charges after Hector, who runs toward the beach. Keough chases, Jack and Kelly pursue, trying to stop him. And suddenly, exploding out of the woods, a ferocious charging GROWL. An attack. Screams all over, a half-second of confusion before we SEE it's a large BLACK BEAR jumping out of the darkness, right at Hector. Hector dives out of its path. Screams, panic, shouting, as the bear rears up on his hind legs. Seemingly about to lunge when... exploding out of the water the giant jaws of a crocodile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a flash instant, the beast engulfs the bear, twisting it, slamming it on the ground and then pulling it into the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bear fights back ferociously for a second but there can only be one outcome here. In a matter of seconds, both bear and crocodile have vanished. And the water is calm again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE THE FACES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Utter catatonia. Shock. Whatever they expected to find in this expedition, they weren't remote prepared for that. There are no words here. Shock is pre-empting every other human sensory.

And as he turns back, he sees it. The croc comes up as Hector screams, jumps off. Screams. Keough leaps off the truck and charges into the shallow water with his gun, looking to give Hector some cover.

Hector then resurfaces swimming to his bobbing chopper. He climbs in.

The croc, unable to dive, is now thrashing toward the beach. But there's no rage in his behavior now. He seems desperate. He's taken some bullets, he's tired, he's wedged inside a two ton piece of metal and he's exhausted.

Breathing heavily, he lumbers into the shallow water, unable to free himself from the mangled wreckage.

And he just cannot go on anymore.

Upon which, a twenty footer, another croc, thrusts up out of the water, seizing Hector. Screams. It death rolls Hector, flings him out of his mouth and in seconds, he's coming up for more. Keough blasts his Avenger. A direct hit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It takes the smaller croc's head right off sending it sailing into the air. It splashes down, the first head not to hit Kelly.

The tents are down, everything's packed. A couple trucks remain. The croc is gone. Things are quiet. Kelly stands down by the water, staring out.

HER P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hypnotic beauty. The lake doesn't even ripple. She soaks it in as if she knows it may be a while before she ever gets close to this again. She HEARS every BIRD. Including a DISTANT LOON. Serenity has returned. Then suddenly... a stone goes skipping out, four, five, six skips. Kelly turns around. Jack stands there. They hold a look.

	I thought I should say goodbye to the lake too.

	Yeah, I thought about that as I was driving... and... I haven't found somebody in my world. You found anyone in yours?

<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.

<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So I was thinking... maybe if I met anybody in my world who was good for you and if you know somebody in New York good for me, we could fix each other up.

	You think?

<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Worth a try. We don't wanna be alone forever, do we?

They hold a look. He kisses her softly.

<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was... y'know if the guy asks me can she kiss, now I'll be able to tell him if you can.

	Good thinking.

And they kiss again, this one escalates a little. They break. And then he holds her. Tightly as the CAMERA PULLS UP to an AERIAL VIEW of them, embracing at the water's edge.

Police cars, lights flashing, motor down the highway. Behind them... on a flatbed truck... a thirty foot giant crocodile. Headed down the southbound lane of the Maine turnpike. Rolling. Rolling. Rolling along. It doesn't even look ridiculous. We've become accustomed to such sights.

Three, maybe four, crocodile hatchlings, a foot in length, are swimming near her feet, eating the bread, nibbling her toes. OFF them, THEN happy Mrs. Bickerman, we:
