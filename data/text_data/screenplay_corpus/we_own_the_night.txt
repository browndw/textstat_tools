:SC: WE OWN THE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE IN:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A PAIR OF SMOKESTACKS AGAINST AN ORANGE AUTUMN SUN SKY... THE CAMERA ZOOMS OUT to REVEAL: A CEMETERY in the foreground. TOMBSTONES blend into a NEVER-ENDING SEA OF MIDDLE-CLASS ROW HOUSES in the distance, and nothing seems to separate the two. A NEWLY DUG GRAVE is in the LOWER LEFT-HAND CORNER of our FRAME.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MILITARY DRUMS. HUNDREDS of POLICEMEN, in their DRESS BLUES, ENTER from FRAME RIGHT. A FEW COPS CARRY a COFFIN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUPERIMPOSE ON THE SCREEN'S LEFT SIDE: THE FOLLOWING WORDS FADE IN--PARAGRAPH BY PARAGRAPH:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
New York, New York. 1988.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A new breed of narcotics has swept the great city, bringing with it a ferocious crime wave more terrifying than any in recent memory.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The old criminal order is gone. In its place, new ethnic groups rise up to seize control without respect for traditional rules of engagement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Outmanned and outgunned, demoralized by cutbacks and scandal, the Police find themselves burying one of their own at the rate of twice a month...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The WORDS TURN BLOOD RED, then DISAPPEAR. The POLICE LOWER THE COFFIN when they arrive at the SITE. As we begin to ZOOM INTO a CLOSE ANGLE ON THEM, we HEAR MUSIC. A THUMPING POP BEAT. THE CLASH'S "ROCK THE CASBAH"...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SMASH CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON: BOBBY GREEN, thirty. He is passionate and vital and handsome, a real physical presence. His CLOTHES are stylish, expensive. A sly SMILE. He steps forward, into:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. STOREROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The camera MOVES with him to SEE: ROSARIO DIAZ, twenties, dark-skinned, impossibly gorgeous. Leaning up against the wall, biting her lower lip, eyeing Bobby with true desire.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...you're so fuckin' beautiful, you know that...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
She beams. They kiss, PASSIONATELY. SUPERIMPOSE: "BROOKLYN". They really GO AT IT. They are ferocious; as they DEVOUR each other:
</DIRECTION>
<ROSARIO_DIAZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you, baby...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSARIO_DIAZ>
<DIRECTION>
Then we HEAR a fist BANGING ON A DOOR, a MUFFLED VOICE:
</DIRECTION>
<MUFFLED_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bobby! You in there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUFFLED_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
No ANSWER--they're too busy making out. Then, MORE BANGING. They both START LAUGHING. The voice continues:
</DIRECTION>
<MUFFLED_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bobby! [If] you two could just keep your hands off each other for a second--I, I think we got a situation brewin' out front!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUFFLED_VOICE>
<ROSARIO_DIAZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's Jumbo... We gotta go anyway...

(beat; to the door)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be out in a second, Louis!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
She grabs him; he moves back in, starts MAULING her again. She SLIDES DOWN his body, perhaps to perform fellatio...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. EL CARIBE NIGHTCLUB - MAIN ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A huge, bustling, vibrant nightclub, very `80's. Decadent, pure New York. BOBBY emerges from the back room area, straightening out his outfit. ROSARIO is behind him, fixing herself and walking toward the front of the club. Bobby enters the PULSING, VITAL HEART of the place. As he appears, everyone approaches, happily shouting out his name. He is having a blast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby is the master of this domain. An `80's version of Tony Manero from SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER, but without kitsch. He is genuine cool. MUSIC: BLONDIE'S "HEART OF GLASS." Bobby waves hello to people, greets them ("Hey, baby!"), a pretty girl kisses him (the women love him). Moves with a swagger, a DANCE. As he sways, he re-buttons his shirt, claps his hands. He is the CLUB MANAGER, and HE LOVES every minute of it. He's GIDDY, ALIVE, a PERMANENT GRIN. WE WANT HIS LIFE. SENSUOUS, SEDUCTIVE, INCREDIBLE FUN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MAN waves to BOBBY. Bobby SEES: seated at a table, surrounded by his gang: VADIM NEZHINSKI. Thirty-five, acne- scarred, huge black pompadour, big gut. One of his men, PAVEL LUBYARSKY, is next to him. Bobby nods back to them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEAR THE COAT CHECK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rosario meets up with several of her girlfriends, and we SEE an OPERATION at work: people come get their coats, slide the coat check girls a HUNDRED BUCKS, and with their coats the patrons get JUNK put in their jacket pockets. Rosario looks to one of her girls--ALINA, a young Russian with too much makeup--and counts the cash. Pockets some of it. From Rosario's BEHAVIOR, we SEE she's INVOLVED in the DRUG TRADE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. THE FRONT OF THE ESTABLISHMENT - LOBBY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HUGE FIGHT that's breaking out. Violent. Club patrons and SECURITY GUYS are in the melee. Girls SCREAM. ROSARIO moves past all this, to the front door. LOUIS FALSETTI, forty, backs off from the multiple struggles all around him. Louis is wearing a jacket that says "SECURITY" on it. He is the jocular type, very overweight, redfaced. Bobby arrives at the fight scene. With cheery braggadocio:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the fuck's goin' on in here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby moves RIGHT IN. Grabs a struggling and drunk PATRON, puts him in a headlock. He gives the Patron a SHOT TO THE TEMPLE, just to keep him docile. Lou, Bobby's best friend, watches the imbroglio with an amused and cowardly detachment, CHORTLING with every punch and scream. He balances a drink in his hand with marvelous care, avoiding spillage. But the BATTLE GETS CLOSER AND CLOSER. Seeing his friend Bobby, who's hardly got everything in control:
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS_FALSETTI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, Bobkes! Looks like you got everything under control here--so uh, so I'm gonna go outside, take my break!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS_FALSETTI>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah--just keep that wide load of yours outta trouble, arright?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<LOUIS_FALSETTI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, your fuckin' majesty!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS_FALSETTI>
<DIRECTION>
The Patron is acting up again, trying to free himself from Bobby's grip. Bobby looks down at him. With humor:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What're you doing?!? You gotta behave yourself here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
Gives the guy a shot in the head. Meanwhile: LOUIS saunters past the melee, jumping gracefully over a fallen drunk. He BOWS in triumph when others applaud his leap. Everyone laughs as he goes out the door. Bouncer FREDDIE helps clean up the mess. A GIRL SCREAMS as a GUY is flipped on his back by bouncers. A PATRON with BLOOD ON HIS FACE, acting like an eight year-old, to Bobby (who hurls his guy out of frame):
</DIRECTION>
<BLOODIED_PATRON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, Mr. Green! I didn't do nothing!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOODIED_PATRON>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well now you're gonna do nothing someplace else!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(louder, to all fighters; pointing:)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now listen--one of these days I'm gonna run this whole block, and I see any you in here again--any you-- I'll bust your fuckin' hole!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Freddie)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Throw `em out on their ass. I gotta go upstairs, drop off my keys with the old man.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. STAIRWELL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wood-panelled walls. Bobby walks upstairs, fixing his hair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. MARAT BUZHAYEV'S APARTMENT - FOYER/LIVING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An ornate, gaudy place. The walls are covered by mirrors with that cheesy brown marble pattern print all over them. Plush couches, clutter. Bobby walks in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We HEAR RADIO MUSIC up here, nothing like the stuff played downstairs. A RUSSIAN CROONER. In an EASY CHAIR sits MARAT BUZHAYEV (pronounced BOO-SHY'-EV). He is old, kindly, weakened by age; sits next to his babushka wife, KALINA. Buzhayev watches a Russian musical program with the sound off, listening to his small transistor radio.
</DIRECTION>
<MARAT_BUZHAYEV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bobby! Come here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARAT_BUZHAYEV>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Buzhayev, how are you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby leans over, hugs the seated old man. The two EMBRACE WARMLY--they are close. Before separating, Buzhayev touches his face. KALINA yells happily in RUSSIAN, grabs BOBBY, embraces him too. She couldn't be more motherly, amd Bobby BEAMS at the treatment.
</DIRECTION>
<KALINA_BUZHAYEV>
<DIRECTION>
(SUBTITLE)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So beautiful! Beautiful!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KALINA_BUZHAYEV>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby is moved, almost embarrassed by the loving attention. Then, gently dropping a set of KEYS on a side table:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, Mr. Buzhayev--I gotta go do something right now. But don't worry--everything's in good shape downstairs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<MARAT_BUZHAYEV>
<DIRECTION>
(warm, gentle)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, good. You take care of things good for us...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARAT_BUZHAYEV>
<DIRECTION>
Marat smiles. Then, as Bobby stands:
</DIRECTION>
<MARAT_BUZHAYEV>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Next week, you come by--we talk. Okay? We talk about plans for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARAT_BUZHAYEV>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby lights up, nods. Marat pats his cheek. Kalina tries to give him a small care package of food. He politely refuses, and a minor and friendly AD-LIBBED argument in Russian ("He said he didn't want any food, and you keep trying to give it to him!") breaks out between the old husband and his wife. As Bobby exits:
</DIRECTION>
<KALINA_BUZHAYEV>

(broken English)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bobby! Where you run off to?!?

<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. QUEENS CATHEDRAL - SUMMER EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A modern church. A big crowd in front, made up of POLICE. We HEAR MUSIC. CLOSE SHOT of a black outdoor sign, behind glass. "OUR LADY, QUEEN OF MARTYRS CHURCH, QUEENS, NY". TILT DOWN: WHITE PRESS-ON letters CROOKEDLY spelling out "NYPD PULASKI SOCIETY MTG. - 7 PM". SUPERIMPOSE: "QUEENS".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. QUEENS CATHEDRAL - BASEMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MUSIC explodes down here. A large room with columns. Streamers, balloons everywhere. Old cops, young cops, men, women, are here. Skinny, portly, giddy, drunk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Many are IN UNIFORM, loosened up a bit, like they've just gotten off work and it's time to relax. Children run about. American, New York State flags. Pictures on the walls: people with plaques, portraits. ARCHIE BUNKER'S NEW YORK. A SIGN READS: "CONGRATULATIONS! TO `CAPTAIN JOSEPH GRUSINSKY'". Cases filled with trophies. Food tables, piled high. And beer. Lots and lots of beer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Many COPS are drinking, cavorting, smoking CIGARS, making sandwiches. And DANCING UP A STORM. Men and women FLIRT, GAB, MAKE OUT. FLASH! Pictures taken constantly. A mass of people surround TWO PEOPLE as a PHOTO is taken:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON: JOSEPH GRUSINSKY, thirties. Bobby's OLDER BROTHER. In uniform. Clean-cut, though not neurotically so. Sharp, tough features--the GLOW of a WINNER. He is SMILING, receiving many AD-LIBBED CONGRATULATIONS and holding one of his children in his arms, infant PAUL. Next to him is his wife, SANDRA, thirties. Next to her, their older infant, TEDDY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEXT TO JOSEPH: BURT GRUSINSKY, sixty. Bobby's father, we will soon learn. Tough as nails. Unsentimental, ex- military, rough-edged, vital. In this world, he is a king.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standing behind Burt are his two closest associates: MICHAEL SOLO ("G.Q."), fifties, somewhat urbane, and JACK SHAPIRO ("Pudge"), also fifties. A big, quiet man. Huge hands. The enforcer. Burt is beaming over his treasured son. He directs a PHOTOGRAPHER, repositions Joseph:
</DIRECTION>
<BURT_GRUSINSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here, take another one! Get another!
	</DIALOGUE>

(in Joseph's ear)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want your face out there--it's good exposure. The PC's gonna see this.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to the Photographer)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon. With both kids.

<DIRECTION>
FLASH!
</DIRECTION>
<PHOTOGRAPHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, Chief!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHOTOGRAPHER>
<DIRECTION>
Burt waves to the Photographer, then leans again into Joseph's ear. Still wearing a smile for the outside world:
</DIRECTION>
<BURT_GRUSINSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see your brother yet?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURT_GRUSINSKY>
<JOSEPH_GRUSINSKY>

:SC: INT. CHURCH STAIRWELL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We MOVE past partygoers. THEN, APPEARING AT THE TOP OF THE STEPS: Bobby and Rosario--who's being eyed up and down salaciously by the men in the party. The two start to come down the narrow stairs leading to the basement. A portly, ebullient man, RUSSELL DE KEIFER:
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL_DE_KEIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bobby? Bobby Grusinsky, that you? How you doin'?! It's me, Russell De Keifer, from across Northern Boulevard, remember? You still bartending that Russian joint, out there in Brooklyn?

	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSARIO_DIAZ>

Burt and Joseph take one look at her and respond with subdued "hellos." She is not exactly, well, PROPER- LOOKING. And she isn't white. She picks up on this, tries to act as though she doesn't care. Burt turns to Bobby:

<BURT_GRUSINSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We gotta talk to you. Alone.

ANGLE ON BOBBY. This gives him pause, but Rosario gives him a slight nod of her head, assuring him it's okay. So:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. CHURCH - UPSTAIRS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack and Michael are walking through the seemingly empty main hall of the church. Looking for anyone who may be hanging out, ducking in and around. They spot a COUPLE, making out in one of the pews. The man is shirtless, the woman in her bra. Caught, they let out an embarrassed CHUCKLE. With offense, but also humor:
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL_SOLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In a house of God, no less? C'mon, get up...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL_SOLO>
<DIRECTION>
The couple sheepishly exits the room, pulling on their clothes. As they do, they pass: Bobby, Burt, and Joseph coming up the stairs. Joseph pulls up the rear, standing behind his father. Bobby sees Jack and Michael, now seated several rows back. BEAT, then:

BOBBY STOPS. Instinctively, he turns back to the room, motions to Rosario to stop. Out of respect. She does. Then: the CHURCH BELL rings. TEN TIMES. Silence. The BELL GONGS. The CAMERA DOLLIES PAST: JOSEPH and his family, and JACK, and MICHAEL, then past ROSARIO, and BURT, and BOBBY. The bell stops. The SEA of BLUE, the POLICE, genuflect. Our characters do not. Instead, BOBBY STARES at JOSEPH AND BURT across the crowded room. They return the glare, and Bobby exits...

MUSIC UP: PRINCE'S "HOUSEQUAKE." Hot girls and flashy- looking guys. The men are drinking. The women make themselves up en masse in front of a large mirror over the sofa. A couple KISSES in the corner. Everyone's getting ready for a night of revelry on the town. They are SINGING, having a GREAT TIME. The decor is late `70's, though not exaggeratedly so. DRUGS are EVERYWHERE. We MOVE PAST THIS TO:

PAN around the ROOM: a set of weights on the carpeted floor, with clothes scattered everywhere; on the wall, a Jets football schedule, a Led Zeppelin poster. Bobby is PRIMPING in the mirror.

ACROSS THE ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At a large CORNER TABLE: VADIM NEZHINSKI, seated in the center. Surrounded by two YOUNG GIRLS and Slavic-featured men and dark-skinned Latinos. A LATINO MAN and one of Vadim's guys, a YOUNG DARK-SKINNED WHITE MAN, converse at the table. After a beat, the two men MOVE TO THE COAT CHECK AREA. CASH stacked on the edge of the table. ROSARIO appears, coming through the crowd. She goes to Nezhinski's table, counts out MONEY for him. Nezhinski appears affectionate with her, sticks some of the BILLS in her hands. Bobby turns away from Vadim's sight.

:SC: INT. MEN'S ROOM - FLASHBACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's the men's room in the club. Louis is in the stall, his pants pulled down. He HEARS: Nezhinski's voice and a muffled struggle. Louis immediately pulls his feet up, squatting on the toilet seat. Looks into the crack in the stall door. We STILL HEAR:
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS_FALSETTI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nezhinski dragged him into the toilet. They stood him up against the wall and held him--
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS_FALSETTI>

We SEE exactly this. Nezhinski faces the MAN. Two associates of Nezhinski's hold him back, covering his mouth with silver electrical tape.

<DIRECTION>
Nezhinski's associates pull down his pants, and Louis sees the man's bare ass. The man is panicking, muffled cries for help penetrating even the flashback. Nezhinski pulls out his switchblade, holds it up to his face, then LOWERS IT. A GLINT of REFLECTION on the KNIFE. HORRIBLE.

VADIM'S TABLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby walks to the table. There's a lot of food around Vadim--he's eating off six different plates. Bobby is really only focused on Rosario. When Rosario sees him (she'd been counting bills) she brightens, virtually getting out of her seat:
</DIRECTION>
<ROSARIO_DIAZ>

AD-LIB GREETINGS. Bobby sits between Rosario and Nezhinski. Rosario kisses him, grabs onto his arm; Vadim puts his arm around Bobby's shoulder. Turns to his people:

Everyone LAUGHS, Vadim most of all. He KISSES Bobby on the head. Bobby looks at Rosario as Vadim continues:

Bobby takes Rosario by the arm away from the table.

<BOBBY_GREEN>

These words hit Rosario, and we SEE that she's troubled by her own behavior because she stares at her shoes, momentarily speechless. He grabs her:

Bobby purses his lips, frustrated. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just hold off then, for a little while. Okay? I got my reasons.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
Momentarily confused, she mutters a "'kay," then kisses him. Bobby moves the hair from Rosario's face.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSARIO_DIAZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you...

</ROSARIO_DIAZ>
<DIRECTION>
BOBBY'S ABOUT TO RESPOND IN KIND WHEN... All of a SUDDEN: BOOM! PANIC. SCREAMING. LIGHTS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The DOORS at the club's entrance have burst open. LOUD, like a gunshot. COPS enter. Plainclothes and uniformed both. JOSEPH comes in, holds up his badge, which hangs around his neck. WITH COMMAND:
</DIRECTION>
<JOSEPH_GRUSINSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everybody! Get your hands on your head and don't fuckin' move!

FOUR UNIFORMED COPS BOLT straight to the COAT CHECK AREA. ALL KINDS OF DRUGS and WEAPONS start falling to the FLOOR. The patrons are desperate to get rid of any incriminating evidence, and BOTH MEN AND WOMEN RUN TO THE BATHROOMS.

<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. MEN'S ROOM

Several patrons start DUMPING NARCOTICS INTO THE TOILET BOWLS when MANY COPS ENTER and, with ferocity, hit them with batons to corral them. The TOILETS are backing up...

:SC: INT. WOMEN'S ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Some girls rush in, others are already inside. Two PRETTY YOUNG WOMEN are in the corner, FREEBASING, when COPS BURST IN. One of the Pretty Girls, out of surprise, starts to shake the small pipe flame to extinguish it. The opposite occurs, and the flame IGNITES THE ETHER. THE TWO GIRLS BURST INTO FLAMES.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Gimme your shit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
Troubled, she nonetheless puts a handful of pills in his palm. Bobby quickly SWALLOWS them. A UNIFORMED COP approaches Bobby:

<UNIFORMED_COP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! I saw that! Get your hands on your fuckin' head!

All patrons in the club, with rare exception, get forcibly lined up, HANDS CLASPED on the backs of their heads. PARAMEDICS SPEED to the LADIES' ROOM. JESSIE THE COP takes out a ketchup squeeze bottle--except it's black--and forcibly fills Bobby's mouth with charcoal:
</DIRECTION>
<PARAMEDIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Arright, open up--a little charcoal, to absorb the toxin...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARAMEDIC>

As Bobby gags, JOSEPH walks through the club with confidence. The place, though absolutely packed, is uncharacteristically SILENT. He turns to UNIFORMED COP #2:
</DIRECTION>
<JOSEPH_GRUSINSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give everybody a toss. G.Q.--

Several COPS laugh. Then: Joseph SEES Bobby, and vice versa. CLOSE SHOT on JOSEPH. He sobers, his brashness muted. Joe walks toward Vadim and his party. Vadim has his face to the wall. Joseph kicks his legs further apart. (Joseph takes his frustration about his brother out on Vadim.) In Russian, SUBTITLED:

	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. It's doubled now, how's that.

He motions for the MINK. She hands it over. HE PATS IT DOWN CAREFULLY. NOTHING.

The Uniformed Cop puts handcuffs on Bobby and others. Rosario watches, upset but powerless. Louis is down, next to Bobby. Unwittingly referring to Bobby's brother:

Joseph nods, acknowledging this news. He EYES Vadim, then turns to the TWO MEN:

	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, let's go. You. And you--

<DIRECTION>
(to the Young Man)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're under arrest, possession and sale of narcotics--

Michael reads two other men, one of whom is a TALL MAN from near the table (a lookout, perhaps), their Miranda rights in a totally perfunctory manner. Almost mumbles them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PARAMEDICS exit the WOMEN'S ROOM. Girls are on STRETCHERS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARAT BUZHAYEV enters the main room of the club. He is ESCORTED by TWO UNIFORMED OFFICERS, who are very obviously NOT ARRESTING HIM. They are asking him questions and writing down his comments. He TURNS TO SEE:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HUMILIATED BOBBY, who eyes him back. Bobby is then quickly ushered out along with tens of others. Marat watches, as does Rosario. Louis and Rosario are left behind, not having been arrested. Neither has VADIM. Joseph moves close to Vadim. With arrogant brio, re: the Dark-Skinned White Man, in Russian, subtitled:

JOSEPH EYES VADIM, virtually mocking him. VADIM EYES JOE BACK with SILENT RAGE on his face. Then the cops push THE YOUNG DARK-SKINNED MAN out, and as they do, he turns back to Vadim. The Young Man is TERRIFIED. Bobby, too, is hauled out like a common criminal. Cuffed...

Lit entirely by large fluorescents overhead, noticeably free of those desks and typewriters that are familiar to us from other cop movies. A big sign above a bulletin board reads, "WE OWN THE NIGHT." Bobby is led in by a PORTLY COP. A madhouse. There is BLOOD all over the floor, forming a LAKE.

Bobby enters. Sitting at the large table is MARAT, playing with one of his grandchildren. Bobby knocks on the doorframe to announce his entrance. When Buzhayev spots him, the child hides behind Marat's leg. Marat lets out a laugh at this; to the child:
</DIRECTION>
<MARAT_BUZHAYEV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No no--it's okay. Say hello...

Marat addresses the boy clutching his leg (AD-LIB a Russian "go"), kisses him, and the child runs off. Bobby steps closer to Marat:

Bobby mutters a "THANK YOU." Buzhayev touches his cheek. Marat then turns back into THE DINING ROOM, spreading his arms affectionately and wide, yelling "OHHH" to the children as they cheer. ANGLE ON BOBBY as we GO TO:

Bobby LUNGES forward, grabbing his brother. Joseph leaps up out of the chair. A FIGHT. Awkward punches are thrown. Messy. Jack and Mike leap in, trying to pull the two apart, hollering "BREAK IT UP" AD-LIBS. The two are split up, panting...

Joseph drives up to the house, a working-class part of Queens. He parks the car.

Joseph looks at his knuckles. They are bruised and bleeding. Emotional about the fight, he looks toward his lit house, then opens the car door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joseph drops his keys as he exits. Reaching down for them on the asphalt, he HEARS a SOUND and LOOKS up and to his left. A MAN WITH A HOOD OVER HIS HEAD. Looks almost like an old-time Klansman, with two holes cut into the hood for his eyes. He's pointing a GUN RIGHT AT JOSEPH. Joseph's eyes pop, and he lets out a quick gasp--but he has no real time to react. The man pulls the trigger. A THUNDERCLAP slaps the silence in the neighborhood: THE GUN HAS FIRED. A FLASH OF LIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MIST OF BLOOD plumes around Joseph's head. The bullet hits Joseph in the face, through the CHEEK. HE snaps back spasmodically.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AN AUTOMOBILE, a MONTE CARLO, pulls up to the scene of the crime. Another HOODED MAN in the back seat throws what looks like a MOLOTOV COCKTAIL into Joseph's CAR. The AUTO starts to BURN. Joseph lies on the sidewalk, bullet in the head, his blood everywhere. He seems pretty dead to us. The Monte Carlo SPEEDS OFF.

As he hammers away, he is involved in some CHEERFUL BANTER with fellow cops:

<BURT_GRUSINSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which kid is it?

The cops turn to each other. Burt tries to prep himself, but it's impossible; we SEE the cracks in his sangfroid:

:SC: INT. BOBBY'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SMOKE AND DRINK everywhere. MADONNA'S "DRESS YOU UP" plays in the background. CROWDED. Bobby, Rosario, and Louis are at the center of a poker game. Lou sits next to Bobby, partnering with him in the game and whispering into his ear from time to time. Rosario sits next to Bobby and watches the game intently.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The poker pot seems exceptionally large. A STOCKY LATINO MAN is the main one competing with Bobby. Bobby's a mess, maybe worse than we've yet seen him. But he is HAPPILY DRUNK, his eyes BLOODSHOT. He and Louis look at their cards. Rosario turns, looks at Bobby for a BEAT. She sees a small bruise he's got on his forehead, kisses it.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSARIO_DIAZ>

	Baby, you got a little bruise here--

Bobby turns to him, winks. The PHONE IS RINGING. A LOT. ROSARIO gets up, walks over to the phone near the sofa and picks up with a soft "hello". Meanwhile, Bobby puts a whole lot of cash in the middle. The Latino Man looks at him like he's crazy. Finally:
</DIRECTION>
<STOCKY_LATINO_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Call.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STOCKY_LATINO_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby takes a SHOT OF LIQUOR. Turns over his cards. He has a pair of QUEENS:

<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>

</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
She shakes her head as if to say, "I don't know." Slightly peeved that he needs to attend to the call, he leaves the table. As he does so, Louis, to some girl, proudly:
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS_FALSETTI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was the one told him to keep goin'!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS_FALSETTI>
<DIRECTION>
Then Louis grabs the pot for himself as Bobby picks up the phone, several feet away from the ruckus. He covers his free ear with his hand to hear better:

Bobby, of course, is stunned. The poker table in the background is a riot, a contrast to the sober message Bobby's getting. He turns his back to the crowd; sotto:

	I probably should've told you not to come down here--there're a lotta things going on right now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL_SOLO>
<DIRECTION>
A beat, then:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You guys blaming me for this? Is that it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<MICHAEL_SOLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, I ain't judging you--I called you `cause I thought you had a right to know. But we're gonna be going hard after Nezhinski--and maybe some other people you're close to. Like that girl you know--
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL_SOLO>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's bullshit--she's clean. You fuckin' keep away from her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby realizes that NO ONE WANTS HIM HERE. He looks through the glass to SEE Burt, still speaking to the Mayor. Bobby storms out of the room to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns toward Intensive Care. SEES a CROWD DOWN THE HALL. Two GUARDS block the doors to the ward. Determined, Bobby decides to walk over.
</DIRECTION>
<GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry. Nobody's allowed in except immediate family.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. That's me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got some I.D.?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby hurriedly takes out his wallet. As he does, we HEAR a SOFT CHIME. A WOMAN'S VOICE SOUNDS on the P.A.:
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good evening. As a friendly reminder, visiting hours will be over in five minutes. Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN_S_VOICE>
<GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Says here your name is "Green."
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look--I'm his brother, you fuckin' hard-on!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby stares at the men for a beat, then makes his move. Charges past the Guard.
</DIRECTION>
<GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
The Guards stop him, and a messy struggle ensues.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All of a sudden, Joseph's wife SANDRA emerges from the ward. She looks devastated. The struggle stops. All fall silent, out of respect. Bobby steps back. Sandra turns to look at Bobby. To the Guards:
</DIRECTION>
<SANDRA_GRUSINSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANDRA_GRUSINSKY>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby walks toward the entrance. Stops. Sandra seems to read his mind, speaks:
</DIRECTION>
<SANDRA_GRUSINSKY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's alone. Your father just left for the precinct.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANDRA_GRUSINSKY>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby nods subtly, mouths a "THANK YOU." The Guards step aside. He walks to the doors. Pauses. ENTERS:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. WARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joseph's bed is in the back of the large space. His face is blocked by hospital curtains. Bobby steps forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly, he walks to his brother's bed. He peels away the CURTAIN. Looks at JOSEPH'S FACE. Joseph's visage is completely RAVAGED on the left side, covered with bandages that are soaked with blood. A TERRIBLE IMAGE. The emotion surges within him; he's HEARTBROKEN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a surprisingly painful moment. We can TELL he didn't expect this level of destruction. His mouth drops open slightly. Joseph's eyes open just a bit but don't look at Bobby. Bobby slowly lifts his fingers, touches Joe's arm gently. His fingers move down to his brother's hand. Joseph is unresponsive but conscious. All of a sudden:
</DIRECTION>
<NURSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NURSE>
<DIRECTION>
Joseph's hand closes around Bobby's fingers. The connection is huge. Bobby's eyes well up, and he rubs them, almost ashamed of the emotion. It is a shocking OUTPOURING of FEELING from him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He leans over haltingly, kisses his brother's forehead:
</DIRECTION>
<NURSE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, I'm sorry--I.C.U. visiting hours are over.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NURSE>
<DIRECTION>
He waits a beat. The Nurse gently pulls his shoulder. He backs away, his eyes reddened. The camera MOVES INTO a CLOSE SHOT on BOBBY as we GO TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. TENEMENT - HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A loud, active hallway of a housing project. Graffiti on the walls, trash on the floor, but FULL OF LIFE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby emerges from the elevator, emotionally distraught. He SEES, in one far corner of the hall, two young Latino teens smoking CRACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He goes to one of the apartment doors, KNOCKS. Opening the door is a LATE MIDDLE-AGED LATINO WOMAN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind her, is ROSARIO. (The woman who answers the door is clearly Rosario's mother.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. ROSARIO'S APARTMENT - FOYER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rosario's mother discreetly backs away from the door. He and Rosario stare at each other for a moment. Bobby gropes for words. His emotions bubble up inside of him; then, barely audible, his voice cracking:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Feels like it was my fault...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
He sinks down, holding her tight, his head at her stomach. She gently strokes his hair, kissing the top of his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She shakes her head to reassure him, whispering "no...no...". In this moment, he needs her. In this moment, he is like a twelve year-old boy...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. CAFE CAPPUCCINO - BRIGHTON AVENUE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across from the El Caribe. It's like a scene out of Balm in Gilead here--raucous clubgoers are eating burgers and drinking coffee after their nights on the town. Bobby and Rosario and Louis sit at one of the tables. Bobby kisses Rosario on her forehead as she reaches into her purse. She looks through a small ziplock bag with a vial of cocaine. Louis, meanwhile, is unaware of Bobby's state of mind, and is busy putting on a show--as usual:
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS_FALSETTI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where'd you run off to, like a Jew? You got outta there, it became like a real zoo. The spics--
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looks to Rosario)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	`Scuse me--the P.R.s, they're goin' nuts for the money--picka picka picka picka--and the girls, they're screamin', and I'm keepin' everybody in line. I'm fuckin' bustin' heads, like Bruce Lee--I'm fuckin' bustin' heads--
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS_FALSETTI>
<DIRECTION>
He gets up and starts kicking and chopping in the air in the clumsiest manner possible. Accidentally kicks the waitress, who's bringing the check.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS_FALSETTI>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, `scuse me, sorry about that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS_FALSETTI>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby picks up the check, hands Louis some cash.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hercules, do me a favor--before you kill a waitress, go pay the check.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<LOUIS_FALSETTI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Arright. But I'll tell you Bobkes, nobody else could ever do for you what I did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS_FALSETTI>
<DIRECTION>
Louis smiles, walks off. Scoops up the tip from a nearby table.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't tell Louis nothing about what happened. Far as he knows, my family moved away, [a] long time ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<ROSARIO_DIAZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I ain't ever gonna say nothing! I just thought...maybe he could cheer you up a little.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSARIO_DIAZ>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby kisses her atop her head. JUST THEN: VADIM AND HIS GANG enter the establishment. They create a ruckus. Spotting Bobby and Rosario, Vadim ambles toward them:
</DIRECTION>
<VADIM_NEZHINSKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, look who's here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VADIM_NEZHINSKI>
<ROSARIO_DIAZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey Vadim...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as Vadim approaches)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We were just gettin' something to eat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSARIO_DIAZ>
<VADIM_NEZHINSKI>
<DIRECTION>
(nods; to Bobby:)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You make it through that bust okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VADIM_NEZHINSKI>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby gives a simple nod as well. Inside, Bobby is extremely uneasy, though outwardly he is quietly confident:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't have nothing on me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<VADIM_NEZHINSKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Glad to hear it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VADIM_NEZHINSKI>
<DIRECTION>
Without making eye contact, Bobby shrugs; then:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your uncle's got some problems now, though.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<VADIM_NEZHINSKI>
<DIRECTION>
(SHRUGS)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He does what he gotta do, I do what I gotta do. He don't own me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VADIM_NEZHINSKI>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
(to Rosario)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Baby--why don't you go keep Jumbo company, make sure he leaves a tip.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<ROSARIO_DIAZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	`Kay...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSARIO_DIAZ>
<DIRECTION>
Rosario leaves the table. Two GIRLS walk by:
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Bobby!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby nods to them. Vadim watches them walk away. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<VADIM_NEZHINSKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know--
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(moves closer; WHISPERED:)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I still got my shit coming in. Some of us think you could help get it out there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VADIM_NEZHINSKI>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a little dangerous right now, don't you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<VADIM_NEZHINSKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We got a lot of muscle behind us. Lotta muscle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VADIM_NEZHINSKI>
<DIRECTION>
The brazenness of the comment shocks Bobby. He looks up, begins to focus. Incredulous. Softly, as the camera ZOOMS INTO a CLOSE ANGLE on BOBBY:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Muscle--?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<VADIM_NEZHINSKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VADIM_NEZHINSKI>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A cop got hit today. They ain't never gonna sit still for that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
Another member of the gang speaks up: Pavel:
</DIRECTION>
<PAVEL_LUBYARSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Police are a fuckin' joke, dude-- the Mickey Mouse ain't gonna do nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAVEL_LUBYARSKY>
<DIRECTION>
Pavel LAUGHS, and Bobby looks at him with real resentment. Vadim pushes Pavel aside, motions for him to sit down elsewhere. Vadim pulls up a chair. Sits down. Intimate:
</DIRECTION>
<VADIM_NEZHINSKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bobby, those cops--they, they ain't no problem.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VADIM_NEZHINSKI>
<DIRECTION>
Vadim turns over his hand. A SPIDER WEB TATTOO graces the palm of his right hand:
</DIRECTION>
<VADIM_NEZHINSKI>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see this? I got this on the inside, at Tchita. You earn these.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(QUIET)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So don't worry--we'll get `em all. Cut off the head, the body'll fall, right? You keep on doin' it `til they get the message.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(even quieter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We got all their names. On a list.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VADIM_NEZHINSKI>
<DIRECTION>
Vadim leans back in his chair. Bobby's eyes widen. Vadim makes a "POP" sound. Bobby tries to hide his shock. Vadim grabs Bobby's arm, squeezes it.
</DIRECTION>
<VADIM_NEZHINSKI>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just think about it. You change your mind, you call Pavel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VADIM_NEZHINSKI>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
(nods; then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll see you around...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
And the men move to another table. Bobby looks at Rosario and Louis, who're standing by the register. They turn back to Bobby and SMILE, totally unaware of the conversation that's just taken place. CLOSE SHOT ON BOBBY as we GO TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. POLICE SERVICE AREA NUMBER TWO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a huge municipal structure. Bobby bolts inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. POLICE SERVICE AREA TWO - ENTRANCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The place is hopping, with police everywhere. Almost like a fraternity house. BOBBY CHARGES IN, looks around. Pushes his way through the crowd toward the main desk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SERGEANT PROVENZANO, forties, rings a SILVER BELL, which is engraved with the words, "Homicide Bell." The room quiets down. Provenzano holds up his hands. Grinning:
</DIRECTION>
<SERGEANT_PROVENZANO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everybody! Our little "A" House got another coupla stiffs today, so it's time for another poem!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(catcalls; reads from a pad)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"The people of Brooklyn have been volleyed and thundered; at last the number slaughtered has reached one hundred!"
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERGEANT_PROVENZANO>
<DIRECTION>
APPLAUSE. Provenzano bows. BOBBY shoves his way through the crowd. Urgently:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need to find Deputy Chief Grusinsky.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<SERGEANT_PROVENZANO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, uh, he's on the second floor, I think. In the muster room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERGEANT_PROVENZANO>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. POLICE SERVICE AREA NUMBER TWO - HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby looks down the hall. He SEES his father, talking to a CROWD of UNIFORMED COPS. Burt sees him, keeps talking. Bobby touches his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pop, I gotta talk to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<BURT_GRUSINSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm working.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURT_GRUSINSKY>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's important--I got information.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby pulls his father aside, looks around to be sure the two of them are out of earshot of others. Forcefully:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's about you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
Burt is surprised. His attention sharpens:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's bad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
Burt realizes the severity. Then we HEAR:
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL_SOLO>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus Christ, you gotta be kidding me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL_SOLO>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. POLICE SERVICE AREA NUMBER TWO - MUSTER ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A large room, lit by fluorescents. Mostly empty of furniture in the center, with vending machines against the wall and a sole IBM PC in a corner. A huge GUN RACK is on the wall, conspicuous, a hint perhaps of the violence to come. It is Bobby and Burt, Jack and Michael. Bobby's been telling his story. He and Burt are seated--Jack looks out the small window in the door, then turns the LOCK for privacy; and a nervous Michael is pacing:
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL_SOLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nezhinski got a hit list? On us?!?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL_SOLO>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby looks at his father, then nods. Mouths an almost INAUDIBLE:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
Michael purses his lips, then spins around to Burt.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL_SOLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We gotta go bust `em, Burt--right now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL_SOLO>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON BURT. He betrays no hint of concern:
</DIRECTION>
<BURT_GRUSINSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. They'll be back on the street in a day. We gotta try and catch `em with their hands full--find out where they got the real weight. Then we can move.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURT_GRUSINSKY>
<MICHAEL_SOLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That could take us forever!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL_SOLO>
<BURT_GRUSINSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doesn't matter. It's our only play.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURT_GRUSINSKY>
<DIRECTION>
Uncustomarily, Jack speaks:
</DIRECTION>
<JACK_SHAPIRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I say we go hit `em all. Wipe `em out, suicide-by-cop--
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK_SHAPIRO>
<BURT_GRUSINSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What're you talkin' about?! C'mon, don't be a first-class schmuck!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURT_GRUSINSKY>
<JACK_SHAPIRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But we don't got the time to infiltrate `em--
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK_SHAPIRO>
<DIRECTION>
Burt lets his temper flare; briefly, we SEE a more mature version of Bobby:
</DIRECTION>
<BURT_GRUSINSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then we make the time!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Mike, Bobby)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I want you all to understand something--we don't ever play in the dirt here, okay? Not ever, no matter what!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(BEAT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You piss in your pants, you only stay warm for so long.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURT_GRUSINSKY>
<MICHAEL_SOLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about callin' in the Feds? They got a lot more juice than we DO--
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL_SOLO>
<BURT_GRUSINSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bunch of college boys from Kansas. We protect our own here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURT_GRUSINSKY>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby sees an opening:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pop, Nezhinski's been talkin' about a shipment he's got comin'. Maybe that's how you get to him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<MICHAEL_SOLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How you know about that, Bobby?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL_SOLO>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
(somewhat sheepish)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They been wanting me to buy in for a while.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
Michael turns to the others. Brightening:
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL_SOLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, maybe that's it, then. If we can get him--
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(re: Bobby)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To set something up, maybe one of our uncles could move in--
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL_SOLO>
<JACK_SHAPIRO>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing to Bobby; with some ridicule)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It'd have to be him--
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK_SHAPIRO>
<BURT_GRUSINSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forget it, both of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURT_GRUSINSKY>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean, set something up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<BURT_GRUSINSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	BOBBY--
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURT_GRUSINSKY>
<MICHAEL_SOLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'd go set up a buy with `em, just like they've been asking you to. We follow you to the spot, bust `em a week later. That way, your name's clean, nobody knows you're involved--
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL_SOLO>
<BURT_GRUSINSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's too dangerous for him! We don't know how solid his cover is out there!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Bobby)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That girlfriend of yours, she knows about you, right? So can we just get back to the discussion please?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURT_GRUSINSKY>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. Bobby is dead serious:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pop?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<BURT_GRUSINSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURT_GRUSINSKY>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You could trust her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<BURT_GRUSINSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. I'm glad. But it's not happening. So forget it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURT_GRUSINSKY>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But...but you could get killed--
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<BURT_GRUSINSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry about me, just worry about yourself, arright? Anything happens with your brother I'll call you. Goodbye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURT_GRUSINSKY>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. Bobby is still there, fixated.
</DIRECTION>
<BURT_GRUSINSKY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goodbye!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURT_GRUSINSKY>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, Bobby exits. We GO TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. BOBBY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby enters his room, which is dark. Rosario is here, asleep. Her back to Bobby. Upon hearing him enter, she turns and looks at him (and US) in SLOW MOTION...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby sits on the edge of the bed, touches her back. She senses something wrong and speaks, voice ravaged by sleep:
</DIRECTION>
<ROSARIO_DIAZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everything okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(BEAT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They said on the television your brother was doing better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSARIO_DIAZ>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby nods.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSARIO_DIAZ>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me and my mother, we said a prayer for him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSARIO_DIAZ>
<DIRECTION>
Something seems to dawn on Bobby:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your mother's real important to you, ain't she. You'd do anything for her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<ROSARIO_DIAZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I guess...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSARIO_DIAZ>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at Bobby, who appears deep in thought:
</DIRECTION>
<ROSARIO_DIAZ>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You thinking about your brother? About your family?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(BEAT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There was nothing you could do...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSARIO_DIAZ>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby leans over, kisses her:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go back to sleep...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>

As her voice plays on the machine: he moves to the dresser, where he opens the top drawer. INSIDE: THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS--his SAVINGS. He begins to take the money out of the drawer and count it when: we HEAR a SOFT BUZZ. He quickly looks over, CHECKS THE BEEPER. He stares at the paged number...

A MAN #1 stands by a bench, almost floating in the fog. He is stocky, dressed in a down vest. Bobby enters the frame, trepidatious; he and the man eye each other for a moment, then Bobby holds out the beeper. The man takes it.

It is an older Catholic church, a beautiful interior. A line of young Latino women hold candles, singing as they walk toward the altars. A HEALING MASS. Rosario is here.

She lights a candle at the altar, then walking back to the pew, she SEES BOBBY and approaches. Bobby looks around, seeming harried and paranoid...

Bobby enters the place, determined. He has A BAG tucked under his arm. Many CLUBGOERS say hearty HELLOS to him. People are dancing, having a glorious time. LOUIS IS HERE, THRILLED to see Bobby. He HUGS him, effusive, heartfelt:

The famous Brighton Beach boardwalk. Bobby stands in the cold, waiting, holding his bag of money. Alone. Takes out the LIGHTER, the LISTENING DEVICE. He fires it--it works. Looks at his watch. In rummaging through his pockets for a smoke, he finds a little slip of paper with a phone number on it. He APPROACHES a nearby PHONE BOOTH. Bobby holds the paper in his hand, dials the number.

:SC: INT. LIVERY CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby takes the front passenger seat. Pavel is behind him. Someone we DON'T KNOW is driving.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby is somewhat edgy, with Pavel behind him. The car pulls away from the curb. Then: Pavel throws a small towel over Bobby's head. POINTS A REVOLVER AT BOBBY'S TEMPLE. Bobby is startled by the action, blinded. Trying to stay calm...

Bobby obliges. The driver, looking anxiously in his rear view mirror, makes a SHARP LEFT, and the car VEERS. Pavel then PATS BOBBY DOWN, searching for a wire, anything incriminating. To the driver:

<DIRECTION>
The camera MOVES INTO a SHOT OF THE HOODED BOBBY...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Livery Car pulls up to the curb. We are on: a strange residential street with tenements and graffiti everywhere. Dark, deserted. Many silhouetted figures stand in doorways up and down the block. They are all armed, with shotguns and machine guns slung over their shoulders. A GARBAGE CAN IS ON FIRE a few yards away. The men get out of the car. They pull Bobby out:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. TENEMENT HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They walk up the stairs, PULLING Bobby up over the steps. He stumbles. They pick him up, lead him to a door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. TENEMENT - APARTMENT - FRONT ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Someone pulls the hood off him. Bobby looks around. The room is ABSOLUTELY BARE. The driver puts Bobby's bag of money down on the floor. A TEENAGED BOY wearing a SURGICAL MASK comes and puts one on Bobby's face as well. Bobby surveys the place. Where the hell is he? With that mask on his face, we HEAR his BREATHING, loud and present, through the sequence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It could be night or day, we wouldn't know. The windows are blocked with duct tape to obscure all light. There is VISQUINE hanging from seemingly everywhere. Parts of rooms are cordoned off with the material. SILHOUETTED FIGURES ROAM through the space like apparitions. A SLAVIC-LOOKING MAN takes Bobby's bag of money, leaves the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stands Pavel, masked as well, armed now with a Kalashnikov rifle. Without a word, he motions with a move of his head to Bobby. "FOLLOW ME," he seems to be saying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby enters the room, right behind Pavel. He SEES: a dresser with a clock on it and a small mirror. Tables set up in the middle of the room with brown jars on them. There is a television on in the corner, a Russian ethnic musical program silently unfolding.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There are other people in the room: a BROWN-HAIRED MAN; and two dark-haired SLAVIC-LOOKING WOMEN. It's an assembly line for the preparation of narcotics.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SLAVIC MAN takes out the STACKS OF BILLS. Starts counting them methodically. Pavel motions to the Brown- Haired Man, puts up two fingers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On cue, the Brown-Haired Man rubs his hands together, then takes two large JARS from his desk. Beneath the desk, Bobby spots what looks like an ENORMOUS NUMBER of packages of NARCOTICS, stacked against the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is clearly THEIR STASH HOUSE. The Brown-Haired Man pours powdery contents from a jar out onto his desk blotter. He sits down, takes off his jacket, REVEALING: TATTOOS, UP AND DOWN BOTH OF HIS ARMS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The designs combine several images--skulls, snakes, and the SPIDER WEB element that marked Vadim's own tattoo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a RUSTY LETTER OPENER--it had been sitting atop the desk--and pierces a GREEN PACKAGE. White powder seeps from the package.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby watches from behind the mask as the man pushes and pulls what looks like pure cocaine in powder form. He uses two PLAYING CARDS to move the drug. Bobby eyes that RUSTY LETTER OPENER...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Brown-Haired Man dips a measuring spoon in another powder to add to the mix. He is cutting the drug. He continues to manipulate the substance, and his hands move with a kind of grace that one expects from a seasoned chef on a cooking show.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT on some lines of COCAINE. Pavel takes a toot. He OFFERS it to Bobby as a taste. Bobby accepts. He pulls down his mask momentarily, RUBBING a RATHER LARGE QUANTITY OF THE DRUG ON HIS GUMS, HIS LIP. We HEAR:

Bobby looks over to see: EMERGING FROM THE BLACK, FROM DOWN A DARKENED HALLWAY: VADIM NEZHINSKI. Everyone is wearing a surgical mask--except, of course, for him. Bobby eyes him with eyes that seem to become more BLOODSHOT by the second.

	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the matter, ain't Pavel good enough for you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VADIM_NEZHINSKI>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's all the money I got. And I ain't gonna leave it alone.

The Slavic Youth finishes counting Bobby's cash:
</DIRECTION>
<SLAVIC_YOUTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all there. Fifty grand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SLAVIC_YOUTH>
<DIRECTION>
Vadim points to the MONEY:
</DIRECTION>
<VADIM_NEZHINSKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where'd you get this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VADIM_NEZHINSKI>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	From my savings. From El Caribe and Rasputin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<VADIM_NEZHINSKI>
<DIRECTION>
(nods; then:)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That buys you three keys in here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(BEAT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With the crack on the street, it's worth two hundred k. Maybe more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VADIM_NEZHINSKI>
<DIRECTION>
Vadim walks over to a stack of green packages:
</DIRECTION>
<VADIM_NEZHINSKI>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All the shit I get here is at least eighty-six percent pure. And we got a lot more comin' in--a LOT more. In a way nobody could ever trace.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VADIM_NEZHINSKI>
<DIRECTION>
Vadim steps away from the narcotics and towards Bobby:
</DIRECTION>
<VADIM_NEZHINSKI>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The whole city'll be sucking our glass soon--you'll see. We push the Guineas out, the Domos'll work for us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VADIM_NEZHINSKI>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sounds good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
Vadim looks at that money again, takes a step forward. Bobby's forehead has beads of sweat. Vadim walks up close. Looks Bobby in the eye for a BEAT.
</DIRECTION>
<VADIM_NEZHINSKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're breathing heavy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VADIM_NEZHINSKI>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I took a little taste.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
Vadim puts his hand on Bobby's chest, checking his heartbeat.
</DIRECTION>
<VADIM_NEZHINSKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, I seen fighters--they breathe like that, means they get nervous.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(BEAT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You nervous?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VADIM_NEZHINSKI>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby shakes his head. He is wired, out of it, but he pulls himself together. His jaw clenches. With fire, an edge of defiance:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm clean.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(BEAT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wanna search me again, you go `head. I just wanna make this deal and go home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
Vadim violently pulls out Bobby's pockets. Out falls: a WALLET, SOME CHANGE, KEYS, A CIGARETTE LIGHTER, MATCHES. He sifts through the items, lighting the lighter. It fires. Bobby gets slightly edgy. Notices that the others congregate around the objects from his pocket--all except for Pavel, who holds an AK-47 trained on Bobby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby inches ever closer to the rusted LETTER OPENER that the Brown-Haired Man had used to open a package of cocaine. Vadim puts down the lighter. And it occurs to him:
</DIRECTION>
<VADIM_NEZHINSKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got both matches and a lighter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VADIM_NEZHINSKI>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby realizes instantly that Vadim is right. Bobby shrugs, feigning innocence. He braces himself and decides to give the signal:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm gonna get pussy from this...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<PAVEL_LUBYARSKY>
<DIRECTION>
(BEFUDDLED)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What you say...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAVEL_LUBYARSKY>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby looks around. There's NO CAVALRY TO THE RESCUE. He tries again:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	[When] this deal goes down, I'm, I'm gonna get a lotta pussy...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
Still NOTHING. PAVEL'S attention turns to VADIM. He moves toward NEZHINSKI, who:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Starts FRANTICALLY POUNDING THE LIGHTER against the DESK. Trying break it open. Bobby scans the joint... The MEN are trained on that lighter, and this is his chance. He slips the LETTER OPENER into his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SEEMS LIKE WE CAN LITERALLY HEAR THE BLOOD RUSHING THROUGH BOBBY'S HEAD NOW. Setting himself, Bobby looks around the room--where's that backup???--and: the camera SPEEDS PAST Pavel's and Vadim's faces, to the other side of the room. It MOVES toward the WINDOW:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VADIM HITS THE LIGHTER AGAIN. This time, it BREAKS OPEN. REVEALING A BEVY OF WIRES. It is CLEARLY NOT JUST A LIGHTER. The camera TILTS UP. VADIM IS ENRAGED:
</DIRECTION>
<VADIM_NEZHINSKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He got a wire!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(BEAT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kill this motherfucker, right now!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VADIM_NEZHINSKI>
<DIRECTION>
IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S A GONER. PAVEL RAISES HIS GUN and CHARGES TOWARD BOBBY--ABOUT TO FIRE, when--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE DOOR BURSTS OPEN. COPS EVERYWHERE. Mike and Jack lead the way, but there are what seems like tens of EMERGENCY SERVICES UNIT OFFICERS with them:
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL_SOLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hands on your heads! On the floor!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL_SOLO>
<DIRECTION>
NO ONE FREEZES. CHAOS. GUNFIRE. PAVEL SWINGS BACK TO BOBBY, a TERRIFYING LOOK ON HIS FACE. But Bobby is ready, and SHOVES THE LETTER OPENER INTO PAVEL'S NECK. BLOOD CASCADES DOWN THE MAN'S CHEST. Pavel collapses on Bobby, still very much alive. His eyes are popping, and he throws his hands around Bobby's THROAT. VADIM CHARGES INTO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. BACK ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Where he pulls up a SECTION OF LINOLEUM, REVEALING a TRAP DOOR that leads down to the apartment BELOW...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. HALLWAY - SIMULTANEOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HORRIFYINGLY--DRUG PEDDLERS, ARMED with all kinds of GUNS, POUR OUT from rooms everywhere--on the FIRST LEVEL of the building as well as the THIRD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AND EVERYONE COMES OUT FIRING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE COPS ARE FORCED TO ENGAGE IN A FURIOUS GUN BATTLE, THE BULLETS COMING FROM EVERYWHERE. ABOVE AND BELOW.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SEVERAL PUSHERS ARE HIT. THE POLICE have their gear and are reasonably protected, though TWO OF THEM ARE WOUNDED.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bullets SPLINTER the floor beneath their feet and the wall right above their heads. They have their backs to the wall as their only cover... PERCUSSION GRENADES THUNDER through the STRUCTURE...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FUSILLADE OF BULLETS. CONFUSION.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOBBY IS CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE. STILL STRUGGLING WITH PAVEL, this has become the madness of war. Pavel bleeds profusely all over Bobby's chest, and this is a fight to the death.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby wrenches the LETTER OPENER out of Pavel's collarbone and desperately--and repeatedly--stabs Pavel in the base of the neck. Pavel's screams mix with gunfire to make a hell...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THAT MOMENT: A SHOTGUN BLAST blows the top of Pavel's head clean off, spattering Bobby's face with brain particulate. Bobby is forced to get out from under... We HEAR POLICE SIRENS. RADIOS ON--
</DIRECTION>
<RADIOS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	1 0 - 1 3 ! 10-13! 10-13!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RADIOS>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. TENEMENT - SECOND FLOOR APARTMENT - BACK ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VADIM slides down to the BACK ROOM in the APARTMENT BELOW. Panicked, he cocks his gun, searches for an escape route.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby gets up, into a crouch, amidst the gunfire. Dodging the bullets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An ESU Police Officer does not recognize Bobby as an ally, and he trains his assault rifle on Bobby. Bobby screams, his hands raised:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm with you! I'm with YOU!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
This is INAUDIBLE, with all the ammo being dispensed, and Bobby knows it; so he dodges the Officer; the Officer begins to unload his weapon, getting CLOSER to BOBBY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AND CLOSER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AND CLOSER. Bobby is about to be killed when:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HE SEES HIS CHANCE. HE CHARGES BACKWARD. WITH FEROCIOUS DETERMINATION, HE THROWS HIMSELF OUT A NEARBY WINDOW.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE PANE SHATTERS. BOBBY TUMBLES THROUGH, HIS FACE AND BODY RIDDLED WITH SHARDS OF GLASS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. TENEMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby FALLS roughly twenty feet through the air. His body tumbles upside-down, toward a wrought-iron FENCE that surrounds the base of the apartment building's side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby HITS the FENCE. His LEG GETS CAUGHT on one of the small spikes. He SCREAMS as we GO BACK TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cop cars pull up by the dozen, from EVERYWHERE. Out of one comes BURT GRUSINSKY, carrying a shotgun. He charges right into the structure...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. DOWNSTAIRS BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nezhinski opens the window, about to go out onto the fire escape. A WARRANT UNIT OFFICER is below. Looks up:
</DIRECTION>
<WARRANT_UNIT_OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Halt! Police!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WARRANT_UNIT_OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
BEHIND HIM:
</DIRECTION>
<JACK_SHAPIRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold it right there! Hands on your head!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK_SHAPIRO>
<DIRECTION>
VADIM SPINS AROUND. FREEZES. His hands are in the air.
</DIRECTION>
<VADIM_NEZHINSKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't shoot!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VADIM_NEZHINSKI>
<DIRECTION>
Officers pour in, among them BURT. Cops forcefully push Vadim to the ground. Start to cuff him. Burt pulls Jack ASIDE:
</DIRECTION>
<BURT_GRUSINSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's my goddamned kid?!?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURT_GRUSINSKY>
<DIRECTION>
Jack is speechless--he doesn't know. (We SEE that Burt's question--revealing Bobby's identity--REGISTERS on VADIM'S FACE.) Vadim mutters, aloud but sotto, in Russian:
</DIRECTION>
<VADIM_NEZHINSKI>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He is a dead man...

<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up! Get down!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OFFICERS>
<DIRECTION>
Burt frantically PUSHES THROUGH THE CROWD OF COPS...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. TENEMENT - APARTMENT - ALLEYWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby is upside-down, hanging from the fence, but he is alert. Two members of the EMERGENCY SERVICES UNIT approach him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On sheer instinct alone, he starts to PULL his LEG off the small SPIKE, his teeth clenched. An ARMY of ESU TROOPS and PARAMEDICS come to BOBBY'S AID...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOBBY is being lowered from the fence. An AMBULANCE ZOOMS UP the STREET, to the alley. Burt rushes to his son. Jack and Mike come right behind him. Bobby looks at his father, his face nicked by many small cuts from the glass. Sheepish, he cannot say a word and averts his father's gaze.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus.

<DIRECTION>
Burt eases when he hears this. They move Bobby toward the ambulance. Burt turns to Michael. Sotto:
</DIRECTION>
<BURT_GRUSINSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You guys go on a bust like this and you don't tell me about it? You think I'm born yesterday?

<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. AMBULANCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby sits up on the stretcher as a MEDIC treats his leg. Burt approaches, watches for a moment. The Medic leaves the post for a moment, and the two are ALONE. Burt stares at his son, who finally speaks:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be all right, Pop.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<BURT_GRUSINSKY>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I guess I don't have a say in anything anymore. Anyway... You did it. You did it and it took real balls.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But now you're burnt--and we gotta get you someplace safe, keep you under wraps for awhile.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURT_GRUSINSKY>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need you to get my girlfriend, Pop. I need her to come with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
Burt is getting emotional, aware of how close his son came to death. Trying not to show it--and failing.
</DIRECTION>
<BURT_GRUSINSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll get them to take care of that. Just go get yourself fixed up-- that's the most important thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURT_GRUSINSKY>
<DIRECTION>
With that, the Medic returns, and with a heavy heart, Burt closes the ambulance door. Bobby is alone with the Medic for a moment in the back of the vehicle; he watches through the window as his father walks to his car. Bobby sinks to the cot, lies down. AS VADIM NEZHINSKI is LED AWAY in HANDCUFFS...

:SC: INT. JOSEPH'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Packed with people and playing CHILDREN. Lively. Food everywhere. TWO ARMED GUARDS stand against the wall. A CROWD surrounds someone. Then, as the CAMERA DOLLIES CLOSER, people move away to reveal: BOBBY, seated in a chair against the wall. His leg is bandaged. AD-LIB friendly HELLOS from partygoers, who surround him and treat him respectfully. PAN OVER TO REVEAL: ROSARIO, seated next to him. She sits quietly; his arm is around her shoulder. People are STARING AT HER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SPIRO GIAVANNIS (we saw him at our film's beginning--he's the Deputy Commissioner and he's in uniform) shakes Bobby's hand enthusiastically. He uses his hands to cup Bobby's:
</DIRECTION>
<SPIRO_GIAVANNIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bobby, hi! Spiro Giavannis, Deputy Commissioner. Glad to see you made it out here today!

<DIRECTION>
A RUSH toward the door. Rosario leans in to Bobby:

<DIRECTION>
He gives Bobby his BUSINESS CARD. Bobby takes it, mutters a "thank you." Spiro pats him on the shoulder, leaves. Bobby turns to Rosario, knowing she's somewhat out of place here. Children run by, having fun. Bobby eyes them, then he leans closer. Sotto, tender:

	`Be right back...

Rosario closes the door on Bobby, turns on the running water. Then begins to rummage through her purse. Finds a small vial of cocaine inside. Takes it out, opens it, but DROPS IT IN THE SINK. The drug spills into the water, washing it down the drain. Frantically, she tries to finger whatever residue is left on the porcelain...

<DIRECTION>
ENTERING THE HOUSE: JOSEPH and Sandra, his wife. Joe holds two bags--one filled with cards and memorabilia, the other with clothes. What seems like a ZILLION PEOPLE are here when he walks in. Everyone CHEERS. BURT moves right behind him, all smiles. Joseph is thrilled--but somehow not the same. His face doesn't look bad, but one eye is a different color from the other, and he's had reconstructive surgery on his jaw. There is, of course, a scar, and he's lost a lot of weight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind him, Burt waves everyone closer. Jack and Mike and other faces we can recognize from around the precinct stand back, all smiles. AD-LIB HELLOS. An elderly NEIGHBOR comes forward, giddy:
</DIRECTION>
<NEIGHBOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow, fella! You look great!

LAUGHTER. Then Joseph FREEZES. He NOTICES: BOBBY, next to the ARMED MEN who haven't left his side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two brothers make eye contact. The crowd quiets a bit. Bobby smiles at the sight of his brother. Joseph gets emotional, too:
</DIRECTION>
<JOSEPH_GRUSINSKY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Bobby...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSEPH_GRUSINSKY>
<DIRECTION>
Without a word, Bobby nods, moves to his brother. As Burt looks on, pleased, Bobby takes his hand and grips the back of Joseph's neck. Joseph pulls his brother to him by his neck. A real embrace. Joseph pats Bobby's back.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm real glad you're home...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
The two separate, both smiling gently. Breaking the moment:
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Everyone, let's, let's move inside-- there's plenty to eat!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANDRA_GRUSINSKY>
<DIRECTION>
Soft laughter. Small talk begins. The group dissipates, moves to eat, etc. Burt moves to Joseph:
</DIRECTION>
<BURT_GRUSINSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Joseph--we got some things we need to discuss, when you get the chance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURT_GRUSINSKY>
<JOSEPH_GRUSINSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We could do it now if you want, Pop. In the den.

<DIRECTION>
Burt nods, reluctantly. All our men walk to the den-- except for Bobby, who hears: ROSARIO, down the hall. She approaches him.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSARIO_DIAZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bobby, I'm gonna go back to the motel.
	</DIALOGUE>

(shakes her head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	N--I'm gonna go back.

A beat. Bobby senses she's not completely right. Looks into her eyes, then, more an accusation than a question:

	<DIALOGUE>
	You fucked up?

A muttered "no" from Rosario, hardly a committed denial. Before he can say anything, from the DEN, Burt peeks his head out:

<BURT_GRUSINSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bobby--you should hear this too, for the trial.

Burt motions for Bobby to enter the den. Back to Rosario:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Burt and Joseph and Jack and Mike. Bobby enters the room. As he does, we HEAR:
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL_SOLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nezhinski's cache was huge, about 40 keys--yayo, some angel dust too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL_SOLO>
<BURT_GRUSINSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're gonna try and turn him, get him to tell us how they're bringing it in. But don't worry--we'll make sure he does plenty of time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURT_GRUSINSKY>
<JOSEPH_GRUSINSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He ain't gonna be reliable, Pop.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSEPH_GRUSINSKY>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby closes the door behind him softly. Joseph sees Bobby, is surprised he's here...
</DIRECTION>
<BURT_GRUSINSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you marry an ape, you don't complain about the stench of bananas.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURT_GRUSINSKY>
<JOSEPH_GRUSINSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSEPH_GRUSINSKY>
<JACK_SHAPIRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's at Rikers. Tucked in, nice and comfy. We're taking him to the A.D.A. next week, for a meeting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK_SHAPIRO>
<JOSEPH_GRUSINSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wanna go with you on that. See his fuckin' face.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSEPH_GRUSINSKY>
<DIRECTION>
Jack nods.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL_SOLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll tell you, though--streets're dead. Junkies're waitin' out there for something big, no question.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL_SOLO>
<JOSEPH_GRUSINSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's `cause we got their number one. Dried it up at the source.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSEPH_GRUSINSKY>
<DIRECTION>
All of a sudden, a VOICE from behind:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That don't mean nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone turns around, slightly surprised Bobby's opened his mouth here:
</DIRECTION>
<BURT_GRUSINSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that, Bobby?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURT_GRUSINSKY>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's a whole network full of suppliers. The organization goes deep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<JOSEPH_GRUSINSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bobby--you done a lot for us already. You don't gotta get involved in this anymore. Okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSEPH_GRUSINSKY>
<BURT_GRUSINSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I asked him to come in, Joe. If he's gonna have to testify, he should know all this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURT_GRUSINSKY>
<JOSEPH_GRUSINSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This's police business, Pop--you gonna make him an honorary member of the Force now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSEPH_GRUSINSKY>
<DIRECTION>
An ugly beat. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be outside if you need me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby exits, and Burt watches him depart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. LIVING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The unaware crowd is having a great time. Children run around the rooms. Bobby SEES GUARD #2, approaches. Burt comes up next to him, takes him into a corner:
</DIRECTION>
<BURT_GRUSINSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	BOBBY--
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(SOTTO)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was said in there, he--he didn't mean it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURT_GRUSINSKY>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby contemplates this; we SEE that he tacitly accepts his father's words. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, why's he goin' back to work so soon, anyway? He ain't ready.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<BURT_GRUSINSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No--it's better this way. I don't want him sitting around with nothing to do, feeling useless--
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURT_GRUSINSKY>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby is about to leave. Burt stops him:
</DIRECTION>
<BURT_GRUSINSKY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, c'mere.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Bobby returns)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A lotta people been talking. About how good you did.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(BEAT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I think maybe...considering the alternatives...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(BEAT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...maybe you might wanna think about joining the Department.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURT_GRUSINSKY>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	POP--
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<BURT_GRUSINSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could pull some strings, get you through the academy with an early LEAVE--
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURT_GRUSINSKY>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, come on! I don't want that!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(BEAT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What I did, I did for you guys, this once. I got my own plans.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby motions to his bodyguard. Burt senses he's said the wrong thing. Gently tries to stop him:
</DIRECTION>
<BURT_GRUSINSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait--Don't go yet--
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURT_GRUSINSKY>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
(to the Guard)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take me back to the motel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
With that, Bobby leaves with his bodyguard. Burt stands there for a moment, frustrated. TEDDY, his grandson, runs past him. Naked. Sandra follows the boy. Burt turns to see the naked youngster, then to Sandra:
</DIRECTION>
<BURT_GRUSINSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't you put some clothes on him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURT_GRUSINSKY>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. METS MOTEL - EARLY EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a cheesy hotel on Queens Boulevard. TWO UNMARKED CARS pull up. Armed Guards exit the autos first, casing the area. They're followed by Bobby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. MOTEL - HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby approaches his room. A Guard, we'll call him VITT, is outside the room holding his shotgun. Nods a "hello". Bobby moves past him, opens the door. The ROOM is EMPTY.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rosario? Rosario!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. Then Bobby spins around, furious:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	WHERE THE FUCK IS SHE?!?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. EL CARIBE NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A number of PEOPLE are HERE. It's PACKED. We are on the DANCE FLOOR. MUSIC: GRANDMASTER FLASH'S "WHITE LINES". ROSARIO DIAZ is in the center of the crowded floor, dancing up a storm. She is having a GREAT TIME, surrounded by many would-be male suitors and Louis. She is laughing and stoned, and her gyrations are wonderfully erotic and free. As she moves, she pushes the men away with a smile. All, of course, except for Louis. Louis dances a CAN CAN with two amused girls. Though fat, he's surprisingly graceful.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALL OF A SUDDEN: COMING THROUGH THE CROWD: BOBBY. When Louis sees his friend, he lights up. Bobby's furious inside, but strangely calm outside:
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS_FALSETTI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bobkes!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS_FALSETTI>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby GLARES at Rosario. He takes her arm, starts to walk her out. She tries to pull Bobby toward the dancing:
</DIRECTION>
<ROSARIO_DIAZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, honey--let's dance!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSARIO_DIAZ>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The cops're right outside--let's go.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat; louder)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said, let's go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<ROSARIO_DIAZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't gotta yell at me, Bobby.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(starts to move to DOOR)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...[I] was just trying to have a little fun for once, that's all...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSARIO_DIAZ>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lou--no more of this for her. It's too fuckin' dangerous now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<LOUIS_FALSETTI>
<DIRECTION>
(SINCERE)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, Bobkes. I mean, she come here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS_FALSETTI>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby grabs Rosario by the elbow. She yanks it away:
</DIRECTION>
<ROSARIO_DIAZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait! Lemme get my coat at least!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSARIO_DIAZ>
<DIRECTION>
Rosario moves toward the coat check, and Bobby follows. As he does, Louis walks with him:
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS_FALSETTI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know Bob, everyone's been askin' `bout you. We was all real surprised to hear about your family- -I mean, your father's like J. Edgar Hoover--
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS_FALSETTI>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah--we'll talk later, buddy--I'll call you. But right now I need to get her outta here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
Louis nods, understanding.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. OUTSIDE THE EL CARIBE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rosario leads Bobby back toward the ESCORT CAR. He leans forward, grabs her arm. Sotto but intense:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You gotta put everything in jeopardy? Huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<ROSARIO_DIAZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! I was just dancing! I didn't say nothing!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSARIO_DIAZ>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, I don't think you realize how serious this is?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(BEAT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We gotta ride this out, `til this fuckin' thing is over. `Til I can get things back on track.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
Looking down at the ground, she exhales. Hits the side of a nearby car gently with the palm of her hand, frustrated.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSARIO_DIAZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bobby, what do you want from me? I can't go out, I can't do nothing-- it's like I'm in a jail--
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSARIO_DIAZ>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. But I'm workin' on it, I am.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looks around; then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Soon as the trial's over and I get my money back outta impound-- everything'll get better, you'll see.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
She gets emotional. Shrugs:
</DIRECTION>
<ROSARIO_DIAZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's just, I feel...I feel like it's just you and all those cops all the time. And they look at me like I'm a piece of shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSARIO_DIAZ>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby tries to comfort her, reaches out to her arm. As tears come out of her eyes:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rosario--once this's done, we'll go down to Miami... [It'll] be a new thing for us--a lotta opportunities...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(BEAT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll talk to Mr. Buzhayev about working for his brother down there. We'll get your mother to come too-- I'll even talk to Jumbo about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
Slight comfort. She nods. Bobby leans over, kisses her. He tenderly puts his hand on her face. She kisses his hand. Their GUARDS are WATCHING. She smiles, and that love returns:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon... Let's go back--this'll all be over soon. I promise...

:SC: EXT. OUTSIDE RIKER'S ISLAND PRISON - EARLY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vadim Nezhinski is being led, in handcuffs, into an unmarked Chevy. Both JOSEPH and Jack are here. Joseph and Vadim exchange looks as Vadim is placed into the back seat. Joe's expression is pure suppressed rage...
</DIRECTION>
<JOSEPH_GRUSINSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll go in the lead car. You stay with him `til we get to the A.D.A.'s.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We SEE Bobby's ARMED GUARDS waiting on the steps. TILT UP TO the closed door. Over this, we HEAR:
</DIRECTION>
<MARAT_BUZHAYEV>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)

	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Bobby and Marat Buzhayev, inside the living room. Bobby sits down, on the couch's armrest; Marat is in an easy chair, his lunch being served on a T.V. tray in front of him by his wife Kalina. The television plays a Russian movie, and Marat seasons his food.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you... You know Mr. Buzhayev, I come to see you today `cause...with everything that's gone on, I don't think it's a good idea for me to stay in New York anymore. I was hoping maybe you could ask your brother if I could work with him, down in Miami. On his restaurant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<MARAT_BUZHAYEV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could talk to him. I think he would like you very much.

<DIRECTION>
Marat turns to Bobby, puts his hand on his knee. Emotional:
</DIRECTION>
<MARAT_BUZHAYEV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're going to be very sad if you're going. Having you here in this house meant a lot to us. You know, my wife and me, we have only daughters.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARAT_BUZHAYEV>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You always been very important to me too.

The car is moving. Jack is driving. Another cop is in the front passenger seat. Two other cops straddle Vadim. Silence, then, motioning toward Joseph's car:

As Joseph looks back at Vadim's vehicle, behind him:

	<DIALOGUE>
	Give me that lighter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK_SHAPIRO>
<DIRECTION>
ALL OF A SUDDEN:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A VAN CROSSES THE LINE OF ONCOMING TRAFFIC. COMES RIGHT TOWARD THEM, SLAMMING INTO PASSENGER'S SIDE. EXPLOSIVE. A THUNDERING SOUND, GLASS EVERYWHERE. THE COP IN THE PASSENGER'S SEAT FLIES RIGHT THROUGH THE FRONT WINDSHIELD. He's probably killed.

:SC: INT. VADIM'S COP CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THREE MEN IN SKI MASKS emerge from the van, automatic WEAPONS IN HAND. JACK PULLS OUT HIS PIECE and immediately begins firing at them, using the wheel and dashboard as cover. He opens his door to slink out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VADIM HITS THE FLOOR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The other two officers are immediately riddled with GUNFIRE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two of the men PULL VADIM toward them. The third man in a ski mask is hit by Jack's fire, but has just enough adrenaline to get into the SECOND CAR.

<DIRECTION>
IT SPEEDS AWAY.

<DIRECTION>
Our characters are leaving the hotel, bags and all. The RAIN comes down in SHEETS. They pause under the awning, waiting for the cars to be brought close. Burt stands under the awning, looking out at houses beyond the parking lot. Rosario is rummaging through her suitcase as Bobby stands nearby. Vitt approaches Burt:

<VITT_THE_GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chief, we got three vehicles coming around the corner. Backup's on the way.

Burt shakes his head, moves to help with the vest:

<BURT_GRUSINSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nah, we're good. It's just, I just realized--I know this neighborhood. I used to come with my father, to work on the plumbing, for the houses--brought me along to do the talking. He only spoke Russian his whole life...

THREE CARS: Burt in one, heading the route. Behind him is Bobby and Rosario's car, with guard Vitt behind the wheel and the two of them in the back seat. A third car has TWO OFFICERS in it. That vehicle trails the other two. The CARS DRIVE OFF.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NOTE: THE FOLLOWING SEQUENCE IS TO BE SHOT IN A MOSTLY SUBJECTIVE WAY, WITH THE EMPHASIS ON WITNESSING THE ACTION AS OUR CHARACTERS WOULD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. BOBBY'S CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby and Rosario are in the back seat. She looks through her pocketbook for some gum, he remains focused on the view through the windshield of his father's car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby's driver, Vitt, follows Burt down the streets. RAIN is FALLING frighteningly HARD, to the point where the windshield wipers aren't moving fast enough for the water on the windshield. Upsetting. Visibility's terrible.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cars swing onto the Kosciusko Bridge loop. The traffic is sparse this early morning. We HEAR the THUMPETY-THUMP of the bridge beams and the windshield wipers. And we HEAR the steady, haunting HUM of the bridge surface beneath the wheels of the automobiles. Bobby puts his arm around Rosario, in the back seat. Re the rain:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's really coming down...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<ROSARIO_DIAZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bobby--I think I left my watch at the hotel--
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSARIO_DIAZ>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby does not answer, instead spots an OLDSMOBILE driving alongside his vehicle. Seems a bit suspicious, the way it's moving...
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey--Vitt--I think somethin's on our right!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<VITT_THE_GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
(TURNING)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh--?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VITT_THE_GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
A FLASH!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CRACK! A BULLET punctures the windshield, but we don't HEAR the SHOT. The hole SEEMS TO APPEAR almost out of nowhere. The windshield cracks down the middle... VITT IS HIT in the SHOULDER, and he lets out a piercing cry. Blood hits the seat. Rosario screams. Bobby pushes her head down, into the back seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAR starts to swerve. Bobby climbs awkwardly over to the front seat. Takes the WHEEL, forcefully pulling Vitt to the side. To Rosario:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get down!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
Rosario crouches, covers the back of her head with her hands. THE WATER gets pushed away by the speedy wipers REVEALING: BURT'S CAR AND THE OLDSMOBILE HITTING EACH OTHER, SIDE TO SIDE; THEN, A HUBCAP--we don't know from which car it's been dislodged...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COMES SPINNING AT INCREDIBLE SPEED. AT BOBBY'S WINDSHIELD. Right at BOBBY, RIGHT AT US. WE BLINK. Bobby swerves. THE HUBCAP SKIDS OFF the front windshield. Bobby brushes up against the guardrail. We SEE THAT IT is all that protects him from spinning off into the river, two hundred feet below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby darts from lane to lane, and the THIRD POLICE CAR-- behind the Olds--has SLAMMED on its BRAKES to avoid hitting Bobby's car...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE OLDS IS RIGHT NEXT TO BURT'S CAR. BOBBY SEES the barrel of the gun swing to Burt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER BIG PUDDLE--A MUFFLED THUNDERCLAP sound... The water slides away, REVEALING that the back window of Burt's car has shattered.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby is startled at this, his mouth momentarily drooping open. He CAN SEE:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS FATHER, FIRING his WEAPON out the window at the OLDS. We HEAR BURT through the RADIO, a STATIC-RAVAGED SIGNAL:
</DIRECTION>
<BURT_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(RADIO FILTER)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They got a hit on! Get support, now!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURT_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby pulls up alongside the Olds. Looks inside. He tries to get a good look but cannot. He SEES TWO people in the car, one driving and one doing the shooting--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOOM! And it punctures a hole in the side of Bobby's rear door. Rosario is JOLTED--screams again...
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rosario! You hurt?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
She shakes her head, her face still buried in the vinyl. She's hysterical--but physically unharmed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The traffic gets denser now. The WEATHER is terrible, blinding. Rushes of WATER COVER the glass around the car, wrecking visibility. We ARE ON: the B.Q.E., with many trucks, big and small, on it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Olds weaves in and out, in front of and behind, many large semis. BOBBY WATCHES AS: Burt's car is right behind the Olds. This is unbelievably dangerous.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A TRUCK starts changing lanes. The Olds scoots past it before it does, but: Burt does not. THE TRUCK CLIPS Burt's car on the driver's side. He sneaks through, recovering and keeping up the pursuit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POLICE CARS, SIRENS BLAZING, JOIN THE PURSUIT...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The truck starts to skid on the drenched roadway. Then: IT JACKNIFES, spinning out. The Police Car behind Bobby's slams into the truck, making a MACABRE CRUNCHING SOUND.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOBBY'S EYES, as he turns around and witnesses the horrific accident through the RAIN-SOAKED rear window. It is TERRIBLE:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The truck CRUSHES the Police car, its carriage flipping over and flattening the vehicle and probably the people inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Olds skids ferociously, pulling off the expressway toward city streets. Burt's car follows. Burt's car and the Olds are neck-and-neck. Bobby pulls up beside Burt. Into the radio:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pop, lay back!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
But Burt does not. Burt has a clear shot at the hooded man in the back seat. HE FIRES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HIT! We can see the BLOOD spatter the perp's automobile. The man's head jerks back spasmodically. We HEAR:
</DIRECTION>
<BURT_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(RADIO FILTER)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got him! I got the sonofabitch!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURT_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
AND THEN, CLOSE SHOT ON BOBBY: THREE QUICK CUTS, CLOSER AND CLOSER...SILENCE... He sees, through the rain: a LONG SHOTGUN BARREL come out of the window from the rear passenger's seat area.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes pop. The OLDS SPEEDS UP. THE BARREL OF THE SHOTGUN turns:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WATER covers the windshield, BLINDING the driver (and us). The water slides off the glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THEN: A TERRIBLE THUNDERCLAP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOBBY WATCHES as BLOOD COVERS BURT'S FACE. He's been HIT. He loses control of the automobile... Bobby freezes, IN DISBELIEF. IN HORROR. HIS FATHER HAS BEEN SHOT...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the RAIN, we SEE: a patch of parochial school children, ASIAN CHILDREN, on the streetcorner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby's car peels off, away from danger. Burt's car IS HEADED RIGHT FOR THEM. In what seems like his dazed last gasp, he SLAMS on the BRAKES. The car skids out, spins. The motion is DIZZYING...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE OLDS is uncontrolled. The vehicle moves through a traffic light, HITTING another car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STARTS TUMBLING, NOT ON ITS SIDE, BUT HEAD OVER TAIL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is one intense image. The car is upside down now. It slides for tens of feet before stopping. Smoldering...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rain falls, making an oddly serene sound. We HEAR SIRENS. The Police are approaching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Burt's car stops slowly. He gets out of the car, his face a mess. He stumbles for a few feet in the rain. BOBBY'S CAR ARRIVES on the SCENE...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BURT'S EYES ARE RED, filling with blood. His JAW is open. He gasps for air, a vacant stare on his face. His body spasms. Then he collapses, on his knees. FALLS. FACE DOWN. IN A POOL OF BLOOD. The Police are in the background...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDE SHOT of the BLOCK as BOBBY MOVES TO HIS FATHER, WHO IS LYING ON THE STREET. Bobby bends down, turning his father over. His father's blood is all over his hands now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Burt is dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Other cops surround them. Bobby looks up at all of them, they at him. Broken, he pushes the others away. As water drips off his face:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't fuckin' look at him! I said don't--back up! Don't look at him...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby eyes his father, spent, crestfallen--but not histrionic. The CAMERA TILTS DOWN. The BLOOD from BURT'S BODY flows into the street, along the curb,into the gutter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. POLICE STATION - HALLWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby and Rosario, outside an office. Armed cops are up and down the hall. We HEAR conversation through the walls. Bobby is standing, smoking a cigarette, holding back tears. Rosario is seated on a nearby bench--wet, shivering, stunned. Rosario looks to Bobby:
</DIRECTION>
<ROSARIO_DIAZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bobby? Could I call my mother...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSARIO_DIAZ>
<DIRECTION>
Speechless, Bobby nods. Jack emerges from the office, approaches Michael:
</DIRECTION>
<JACK_SHAPIRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No I.D. on the guys in the car. Probably illegals. But Mike--
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pulls M. closer)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
(turns to Bobby)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We gotta get you to a secure location, Bobby--
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL_SOLO>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby, emotional and glassy-eyed, interrupts:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does my brother know yet?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<MICHAEL_SOLO>
<DIRECTION>
(beat; then:)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's taking it very hard.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(BEAT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They had to sedate him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL_SOLO>
<DIRECTION>
These words hit Bobby. His eyes close, forcing tears down his cheeks.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then you gotta take me to him...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(SOTTO)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wanna go see him...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
Michael turns to an OFFICER, motions. The officer leaves. The camera DOLLIES INTO a CLOSE SHOT of Bobby and we GO TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. JOSEPH'S HOUSE - DEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sitting on the couch is Joseph. He is trying to be stoic, but appears wan and tired. Alone. We HEAR the crowd in the house, but they are in the living room. A KNOCK: Bobby enters.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Joseph?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
Joseph eyes him, seems heartened by the sight of his brother. But he is out of it, emotionally bludgeoned:
</DIRECTION>
<JOSEPH_GRUSINSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I'll catch `em, Bobby. Don't worry...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSEPH_GRUSINSKY>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby walks over to Joseph, stands close to him. Searches for words. Before he can speak:
</DIRECTION>
<JOSEPH_GRUSINSKY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're gonna need us to identify the body...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSEPH_GRUSINSKY>
<DIRECTION>
Then, as emotional as we've yet seen him, Bobby strains to get the sentences out of his mouth:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know if I can do that. I MEAN--
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(BEAT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I saw him die...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby breaks down. Joseph responds by CLUTCHING him tightly. The brothers rock back and forth gently.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wanna stay close to you from now on, Joe...

	I wanna stay with you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shot is of a small and bare room in a Queens funeral home. In the center is a COFFIN. The camera DOLLIES TOWARD IT. Entering the room is an UNDERTAKER, with Bobby and Joseph right behind.
</DIRECTION>
<UNDERTAKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We know mere words cannot suffice in this time of tragedy. We're so very sorry about your loss...
	</DIALOGUE>
</UNDERTAKER>
<DIRECTION>
The Undertaker unhinges the coffin. Inside is Burt, eyes closed, clothed in a suit. We don't see the body; what we DO see are the reactions of his two sons. Bobby's grief is obvious, but he's already seen him dead. This is new territory for Joseph, who though he does not break down, seems overwhelmed. Both young men nod in acknowledgement, and the Undertaker closes the coffin.
</DIRECTION>
<UNDERTAKER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now I'm told you're going to be handling the arrangements for tomorrow's service--?

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

</UNDERTAKER>
<DIRECTION>
As the Undertaker leads Joseph away, Bobby enters an:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. ANTECHAMBER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Where waiting are Jack and Michael. Bobby gives a fiery stare to the two cops. He approaches them. Sotto but intense, his teeth clenched in a simmering anger:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You gonna fuckin' catch these guys?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
A nod. Bobby senses uncertainty:

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You ain't got nothing, do you.

The men all turn around. Joseph stands there, wounded but COMMITTED:

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be ready to come back and head it up. I'll be ready and, and we'll get `em.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(BEAT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	After the funeral.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSEPH_GRUSINSKY>
<DIRECTION>
Joseph turns and reenters the room with the coffin. Bobby WATCHES him from behind, as his hand runs along the top of the casket. We HEAR:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BRRRRRRRUUUMMM...BRRRRRRRUUUUMMM...BRRRRRRRUUUMMM...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. INTERBORO CEMETERY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LIMOUSINE pulls up against the backdrop of thousands of tombstones. Emerging are Bobby and Joseph. They are both wearing dark sunglasses. Rosario and Sandra and the children get out behind them and are led away by funeral coordinators to another place in the coming processional. In the distance, many many people and a long line of cars move toward the two brothers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Undertaker walks away briefly, to direct some traffic. Bobby slowly puts his arm around Joseph's waist, prompting:
</DIRECTION>
<JOSEPH_GRUSINSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bobby... I'm real glad you're with me now...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSEPH_GRUSINSKY>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Course...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
Joseph grows more emotional, adjusts his sunglasses. Leans to Bobby, clears his throat. Sotto:
</DIRECTION>
<JOSEPH_GRUSINSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, I was...I was jealous of you, [for a] long time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSEPH_GRUSINSKY>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby is surprised to hear this admission, and is taken aback by the honesty of it--especially in this moment. Joseph grabs his brother's arm, his voice cracking:
</DIRECTION>
<JOSEPH_GRUSINSKY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I always did what Pop wanted. And you were free...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSEPH_GRUSINSKY>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby tears up, his voice breaking too; he shakes his head:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.... I did it to hurt him... I disappointed him...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
Interrupting the moment, the Undertaker approaches:
</DIRECTION>
<UNDERTAKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gentlemen?
	</DIALOGUE>
</UNDERTAKER>
<DIRECTION>
The Undertaker guides the two men toward the procession. Just as the drums reach a THUNDEROUS VOLUME, we GO TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MINUTES LATER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A line of cars files into the cemetery, led by the HEARSE. The procession is PHENOMENALLY LONG. The New York skyline is in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNIFORMED POLICE LINE the narrow road. The COFFIN is removed from the HEARSE, put on WHEELS for the move to the gravesite. Bobby, Joseph approach. The DRUMS CONTINUE:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BRRRRRRRUUUMMM...BRRRRRRRUUUMMM...BRRRRRRRUUUMMM...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
People get out of their cars. Many of them we recognize from elsewhere in the film but don't know by name. One of the people to emerge from a Town Car is MARAT BUZHAYEV and his ever-present BABUSHKA WIFE, KALINA.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The walk begins, with everyone saluting Bobby and Joseph.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind them, the Mayor, the Commissioner, all the rank and file of the Force. The turnout is enormous. Rosario is here too, though several rows back. She is with the women.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby peers at the procession, which is made up of hundreds of SALUTING COPS, others. AMONG THEM, we SPOT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOUIS FALSETTI.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At that moment, BOBBY SEES his old friend, and the two make EYE CONTACT. Bobby is greatly moved by his appearance, and nods subtly to Jumbo. Louis salutes gently, a slight and sympathetic smile coming across his face...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SIMULTANEOUS: Joseph takes a look at the COFFIN, grows more distraught. He breaks down. Bobby is there to catch him and does. Several WHITE-GLOVED COPS move to help, and then, trying to recompose himself, he squeezes his brother's forearm for support. Tries to straighten:
</DIRECTION>
<JOSEPH_GRUSINSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...It's all right... I'll be all right...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSEPH_GRUSINSKY>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby is devastated by seeing his brother like this and is momentarily rendered speechless. He tightens his own grasp around Joseph, leads him on the walk behind the COFFIN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FURTHER DOWN THE PROCESSIONAL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rosario. Walking. Eyeing the Cops, the Cop Wives. She does not fit in. Cops are staring at her. She SEES COP WIVES looking at her, leaning over to each other and TALKING ABOUT HER. Though she can't hear what they're saying, she is made to feel terribly uneasy...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rosario quickens her pace away from them, and the MARCH MOVES ON...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. GRAVESITE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The line of police and relatives now heap dirt onto the coffin, which is in the ground. BOBBY and JOSEPH silently lead the line, shoveling dirt and moving on. Rosario moves behind them. Bobby SEES: BEYOND THE CEMETARY GROUNDS: TEENAGERS have climbed the trees. And they're LAUGHING at the spectacle. Michael stands next to Bobby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beat, then Bobby speaks in a way that's preoccupied. Almost as if the words are more for himself than for Mike:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't live like this no more, Mike... They destroyed my family.
	</DIALOGUE>

Bobby leans closer, more focused:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I, I could join you.

Michael turns to him, surprised.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
A beat, as Mike ponders. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL_SOLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then you gotta understand--this ain't something you do just for a vendetta. You gotta go back to the Academy when you're done, you gotta commit yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>

Bobby looks at his brother, then back to Mike.
</DIRECTION>

<MICHAEL_SOLO>
	<DIALOGUE>

</MICHAEL_SOLO>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby again eyes Joseph, who stands over the grave wiping his eyes with a handkerchief. He WALKS OVER to him, puts his arm around him. Into his ear:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Joe, I'm gonna join you. I just decided...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(BEAT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay?

<DIRECTION>
ANGLE BACK on Bobby, as he spots ROSARIO, who stares right back at him. He's GOING TO HAVE TO TELL HER HIS DECISION. A LINE OF POLICEMEN in white gloves begins to FIRE RIFLES into the AIR. FIVE SHOTS...

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby is still in his funeral suit, standing near the sofa. Smoking a cigarette, holding a drink in his hand. An ARMED GUARD accompanies Rosario into the hotel room--they've arrived home from the funeral separately. She turns her back to him, puts her handbag down on a dresser.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby eyes the Guard, who promptly leaves the room. He places his drink on the coffee table.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wanna talk to you about something.

She looks at him for a moment, then stares at the floor. Shakes her head. She gets emotional:

(struggling to stay CALM)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't let you do that. That ain't safe for you.

<ROSARIO_DIAZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know that's not true, Bobby. They're not after me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSARIO_DIAZ>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold on a second--I know what I'm talking about'd be a change.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(BEAT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It'd be a big change for us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
She is still shaking her head, still staring at the floor:
</DIRECTION>
<ROSARIO_DIAZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	BOBBY--
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSARIO_DIAZ>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby gets up, walks over to the desk. Rubs his fingers on its surface, not looking at her but resolutely:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But we could make a life here. This'd be something we could build on. We could raise a family, and...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
This seems to focus Rosario who stares at him. He moves closer to her:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pretty soon you'd fit in.

</BOBBY_GREEN>
<ROSARIO_DIAZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bobby!

She halts him, opens up. Tearful:
</DIRECTION>
<ROSARIO_DIAZ>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I gave it all up for you and you changed everything!
	</DIALOGUE>

	Gave it up? Gave up what?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat; explodes)

</BOBBY_GREEN>
<ROSARIO_DIAZ>
<DIRECTION>
(beat; deeply hurt)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you were clean, Bobby? We were TOGETHER--
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSARIO_DIAZ>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, maybe I was a piece of shit too! Wasting my goddamned time!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
She is momentarily speechless.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSARIO_DIAZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How could you say that...? We had PLANS--
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSARIO_DIAZ>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wake up! All that was nothing!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<ROSARIO_DIAZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! Now is nothing! Look at what's happened to your family, Bobby--your father, he's dead--look at your brother! It could all happen to you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSARIO_DIAZ>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My brother's gonna be all right-- and nothing's gonna happen to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<ROSARIO_DIAZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what you said before.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSARIO_DIAZ>
<DIRECTION>
A moment, then she turns to walk toward the bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey--where you goin'--
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby grabs her.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSARIO_DIAZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get off me! Let me go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSARIO_DIAZ>
<DIRECTION>
He holds her by the wrists:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the fuck you doin'?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<ROSARIO_DIAZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get off me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSARIO_DIAZ>
<DIRECTION>
A TUSSLE. As he tries to restrain her, a torrent of emotion explodes from Rosario:
</DIRECTION>
<ROSARIO_DIAZ>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get off me--I don't want it! It's not what I want!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSARIO_DIAZ>
<DIRECTION>
She breaks free. Panting, tears streaming down her cheeks. After a beat, Bobby seeks to calm her.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right. Why don't you just calm down and think about it a little.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him, frozen.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think about it, you'll feel different. You'll understand. And in time, we'll look back on all this and you'll see I was right. Look--I love you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(BEAT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you go get some rest?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
Without a word, she turns and walks back into the bedroom. Closes the door. Bobby sinks to the couch, picks up his drink. After a beat, we HEAR a:
</DIRECTION>
<MAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We appreciate your patience, Bobby.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FACE OF SPIRO GIAVANNIS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he looks into the CAMERA. We can't yet TELL where we are. He continues, backing up from us slowly, leading us somewhere not yet in focus:
</DIRECTION>
<SPIRO_GIAVANNIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Commissioner is here now, and he's ready to go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPIRO_GIAVANNIS>
<DIRECTION>
We PAN AROUND to REVEAL: BOBBY GREEN, as he steps forward, in FORMAL POLICE UNIFORM. His HAIR is cut, closely-cropped now. He is clean shaven. A REAL PHYSICAL TRANSFORMATION.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A lavish room. Filled with photographs of important people shaking hands, receiving awards, etc. COMMISSIONER WILLIAM RUDDY, a middle-aged, balding, and yes, ruddy-faced man, is here.
</DIRECTION>
<COMMISSIONER_RUDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're all very sorry about your father--he was a great man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COMMISSIONER_RUDDY>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, sir. I'm gonna try and do my part too, now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<COMMISSIONER_RUDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. Raise your right hand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COMMISSIONER_RUDDY>
<DIRECTION>
Ruddy leads him to the corner of the office. Bobby is guided into position as: the Commissioner picks up a small, leather-bound black book. With one hand, he holds the Bible upon which Bobby places his hand. With the other, he holds a manual, off which he reads an oath:
</DIRECTION>
<COMMISSIONER_RUDDY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"I hereby pledge and declare..."
	</DIALOGUE>
</COMMISSIONER_RUDDY>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby repeats after him. (This process continues until the entire PLEDGE IS COMPLETED.)
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"I, Robert Green, hereby pledge and DECLARE--
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
SERIES OF SHOTS:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Of Bobby in the POLICE ARMORY. He is RECEIVING his GUN and his BADGE. Over this, we STILL HEAR:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"--that I will support and defend the Constitution, both of the United States government and the State of New York, to the best of my ability..."
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. POLICE STATION HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks down the hall, with his back to us.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"...I will faithfully discharge my duties in the rank of rider in the New York City Police Department. So help me God."
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO THE COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ruddy and Giavannis shake Bobby's hand vigorously:
</DIRECTION>
<COMMISSIONER_WILLIAM_RUDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Congratulations!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COMMISSIONER_WILLIAM_RUDDY>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO THE POLICE STATION HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT on BOBBY, PAUSING right before he enters the MUSTER ROOM. HE takes a breath and ENTERS:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. POLICE STATION - MUSTER ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Many cops, mug shots and files strewn all over. A discussion, in media res. Many cops approach Bobby, all of whom shake his hand, AD-LIBBING WHISPERED "HEY, BOBBY" and "WELCOME TO THE FORCE." Bobby thanks them, then moves to stand behind his brother. Michael testily grills Jack on the investigative progress:
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL_SOLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...But we got our guys out there, working the street all over? I mean, they coupeing or they working?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL_SOLO>
<JACK_SHAPIRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everybody's out there, bustin' balls, left and right! What else you want us to do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK_SHAPIRO>
<DIRECTION>
As Michael says the following dialog, a UNIFORMED OFFICER comes up to Bobby. Sotto, in his ear, he speaks to him:
</DIRECTION>
<UNIFORMED_OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bobby, a Rosario Diaz's been callin' for you. She says she needs to talk to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</UNIFORMED_OFFICER>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks. I'll call her back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<MICHAEL_SOLO>
<DIRECTION>
(SIMULTANEOUS)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you tell Narcotics Queens we got an A-1 sale hanging over our head and either they help us or we fuckin' take it out on `em later!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL_SOLO>
<DIRECTION>
The Uniformed Officer leaves, and Bobby stays put to hear this exchange.
</DIRECTION>
<JOSEPH_GRUSINSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about Nezhinski's uncle? That clubowner--Marat Buzhayev?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSEPH_GRUSINSKY>
<JACK_SHAPIRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Clean. We tailed him for weeks. Goes out with his grandkids, takes `em horseriding at Floyd Bennett Field... Checks on his fur business from time to time--we even looked at some of the coats and tore `em apart. Turned out to be fake sable, if you could believe it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK_SHAPIRO>
<JOSEPH_GRUSINSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's comin' up quick, we don't know anything... We're gonna lose it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSEPH_GRUSINSKY>
<MICHAEL_SOLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Joe--this is still new territory for all of us. I mean, we hadda use your brother here to get any results to begin with.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL_SOLO>
<DIRECTION>
Michael points to Bobby, who up until now had been focused on--and concerned by--his brother's behavior.
</DIRECTION>
<JOSEPH_GRUSINSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know that. And my family takes the hit--my family...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSEPH_GRUSINSKY>
<DIRECTION>
An awkward silence. Everyone's pained. Bobby stiffens:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could you guys go outside for a minute? I wanna talk to my brother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
Michael hesitates, then nods. Everyone wheels around and exits the room. Jack follows Mike out the door. Bobby turns to his brother:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're trying to do everything-- it's gonna kill you.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We don't got much time...we lose Nezhinski, we're both dead... [The] streets'll get flooded, the whole City's gonna be on fire--
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSEPH_GRUSINSKY>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We could handle it. I mean, I come on to help you--

</BOBBY_GREEN>
<JOSEPH_GRUSINSKY>
<DIRECTION>
(INTERRUPTING)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I didn't ask you to do that. I don't need your help--I could deal with it on my own.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSEPH_GRUSINSKY>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. But you don't gotta do everything yourself. That's what I'm trying to tell you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby eyes Joseph, who looks deeply troubled. Bobby sits.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Joe, what's wrong? Come on, you can tell me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(BEAT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A deal this big, something's gonna come up. You'll see--someone'll fold.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
Joseph ponders for a beat, then comes out with it:
</DIRECTION>
<JOSEPH_GRUSINSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not that. It's just... You give up what you wanted to do to be here, Bobby. And part of me feels a little responsible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSEPH_GRUSINSKY>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nah, you didn't do nothing. It's meant to be. You can't fuckin' control it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<JOSEPH_GRUSINSKY>
<DIRECTION>
(slight laugh)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, I remember when Pop was mad at you, he always used to say you didn't believe in our family. And Mom, she'd protect you. She'd give you those little caramels... Anyway, I knew he was wrong too, but I didn't say nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSEPH_GRUSINSKY>
<DIRECTION>
Just then: the Uniformed Officer KNOCKS and RE-ENTERS:
</DIRECTION>
<UNIFORMED_OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bobby, Rosario Diaz just called again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</UNIFORMED_OFFICER>
<BOBBY_GREEN>

	Tell her I'm on my way back now.

<DIRECTION>
(to Joseph)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry. That's all in the past.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll see you later.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. PAN AMERICAN MOTOR INN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An UNMARKED CAR with Bobby inside pulls up to the front. A GUARD steps forward to greet, protects him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. MOTEL ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby enters. There are several guards in the space. Bobby scans the room, and quickly notices EVERYTHING OF ROSARIO'S IS GONE. Bobby wheels around, to a GUARD. INTENSE EXPRESSION.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened--where'd she go?!?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She left about an hour ago. She said to give you this--
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
The GUARD hands Bobby a NOTE. BOBBY SEES IT, GRABS IT WITHOUT READING IT.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We gotta go find her!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She asked us not to, Bobby. She's-- Bobby--we can't do that legally!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby tries to charge past them. The Guards all restrain him delicately ("C'mon, calm down"), but Bobby is in no mood and instead starts a melee. He is a tour de force of energy, and it takes no less than everyone here to subdue him. The FIGHT is more a WRESTLING MATCH than anything else, and it is messy, tough:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	DON'T--FUCKIN'--
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby's forehead is cut; the struggle is UGLY. The Guards rouse up enough strength to PUSH HIM into the HOTEL ROOM for GOOD. THE DOOR SLAMS. A SILENT BEAT. Bobby paces, in a rage. Then, sarcastic:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go `head! Keep me in here--KEEP ME HERE!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<GUARD_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(MUFFLED)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bobby, we don't wanna have to put you in restraints, so just calm down!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(BEAT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Calm the fuck down!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby stares at the door.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You gonna keep me here? HUH?!?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
Still in a fury, he takes a lamp and HITS THE DOOR REPEATEDLY. Then he HURLS the lamp toward a mirror on the wall, AND IT SHATTERS... Exhausted, he stops. Moves to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Where he sits on the edge of the bed, touches his neck. BLOOD on his hand. He STILL GRIPS THE UNREAD NOTE. He throws it to the ground; and then, perhaps motivated by the realization of his situation, a flood of feeling comes over him. Tears begin to fall down his face, and he succumbs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is as though all of the emotions in our story find their outlet here, in this moment. Bobby lets all the remaining feeling drain from him until he has nothing left.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After this outburst, he is exhausted. He calms, breathing heavily. A beat; he puts his bloodied hand to his head...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We PRELAP the SOUND of a PHONE RINGING:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. QUEENS BAR - PHONE BOOTH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A noisy Queens place, its blue collar patrons watching boxing on the television and cheering. PAN OVER TO: one of those old, in-the-wall phone booths, with a sliding door. Bobby is on the phone, seated in the dark space. Holds a GLASS half-full of LIQUOR. Distraught, he listens for an answer as the PHONE RINGS once more. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<A_MAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(PHONE FILTER)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello?
	</DIALOGUE>
</A_MAN_S_VOICE>

A BEAT. Bobby collects himself. Then:

	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS_FALSETTI>
<BOBBY_GREEN>

ANGLE on BOBBY as we GO TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. EL CARIBE NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SHOW is about to go on. The place has a darker quality to it now, and many patrons are wearing HALLOWEEN MASKS. BOBBY ENTERS, approaches a table in the back, where seated are Louis and Louis' girlfriend, HAZEL. Lou is armed with a huge grin, and he stands and hugs Bobby:
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS_FALSETTI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My brother! The Grand Return!

As they sit, Lou notices Bobby is alone:

</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
JUST THEN, THE HOUSE LIGHTS DIM. A SPOTLIGHT on the STAGE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARAT BUZHAYEV ambles up to the microphone with some difficulty.
</DIRECTION>
<MARAT_BUZHAYEV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good evening. My name is Marat Buzhayev, and I'm the owner of the El Caribe. We have a special night, tonight--the Odessa Dance Troop is here to perform for us. I know you'll enjoy it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARAT_BUZHAYEV>
<DIRECTION>
APPLAUSE. Marat holds up his hands to quiet the clapping:
</DIRECTION>
<MARAT_BUZHAYEV>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We also have an old friend who's come back to us--I want him to stand--Bobby? Ladies and gentlemen, Bobby Green, who used to be our manager here...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARAT_BUZHAYEV>
<DIRECTION>
MORE APPLAUSE. THE SPOTLIGHT swings to Bobby, who stands briefly, sheepishly. Marat waves to him, Bobby nods, sits. The SPOTLIGHT swings back to Marat who finishes up his introduction ("Enjoy the show!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thank you.") and exits to still more applause. ELI MIRICHENKO, Marat's son-in-law, approaches Bobby. In his EAR:
</DIRECTION>
<ELI_MIRICHENKO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My father-in-law would love it if you come upstairs later, to say hello.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI_MIRICHENKO>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, Eli. Tell him I'll come up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>

Eli nods, exits. Beat. Then, sensing Bobby's mood:

<LOUIS_FALSETTI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bob, you all right?

</LOUIS_FALSETTI>
<BOBBY_GREEN>

(hesitates; then)
</DIRECTION>

Louis is crying loudly, like a ten year-old. He falls to his knees. Shivering in fear, he moves to Bobby's feet:
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS_FALSETTI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bobby, I... I told `em where you were--but, but it ain't what you think! I was makin' a buy and these guys in hoods, they held a gun to my head--so I tried to give `em the wrong information!

Bobby stares at him for a moment, then his teeth grit. He tries to calm himself but cannot. With a ferocity, he unleashes a brutal punch across Louis' face with the brunt of his fist. Louis collapses. In Louis' ear:

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FOOTSTEPS. The AFRICAN-AMERICAN MALE is on guard. The MAN emerges from the darkness, his back STILL TO US. Upon seeing him, the African-American Man smiles, reaches into his pocket. Hands the unseen man a small yellow envelope:

SERIES OF SHOTS of: WIDE SHOT of A MARSH AREA, with tall wheatlike weed growth that is extremely dense. MEDIUM SHOT of a STRUCTURE, in the middle of this. An old, small, abandoned stone building, built as a WPA project in the 1930's. It is a men's/ladies' bathroom, probably a Robert Moses project, but long since abandoned. WIDE SHOT of the STRUCTURE. The CAMERA BOOMS DOWN, from high above the STONE BUILDING, and PANS to REVEAL the TALL WEEDS AROUND IT. MEDIUM SHOT of ELI'S DARK BLUE AUTOMOBILE, arriving. Eli emerges from the car. A bodyguard behind him, armed with an AK-47. He prepares to GREET:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AN ARRIVING LIVERY CAR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Out steps: A HOST of men in suits, grasping suitcases-- presumably filled with money.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THEN ANOTHER TOWN CAR. And yet ANOTHER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The men all congregate like it's a legal business transaction. HANDSHAKES, SMILES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We PAN AROUND, MOVING THROUGH THE WEEDS NOW. And we SEE: Bobby and Joseph, as they arrive, MOVE INTO POSITION. The camera MOVES LATERALLY and we SEE: Michael and Jack and other COPS, doing much the same. All carrying SHOTGUNS. One COP POINTS A SHOTGUN MICROPHONE at the ACTIVITY, and our guys can HEAR perp conversations in their EARPIECES...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER CAR ARRIVES. APPEARING out of it is VADIM NEZHINSKI. Joseph bristles at the sight of him. Bobby grabs his brother's arm, squeezes:

	We're gonna get all of `em today.

</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
JUST AT THAT MOMENT, a WHITE VAN PULLS UP: two men get out. They open the back, FILLED WITH FURS. They take a number of coats out of the BACK OF THE VAN, bring them to the shack...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALL THE COPS appear confused. What the hell is this? ANOTHER TOWN CAR. A CROWD OF PEOPLE stand around the auto. Helping someone out of the vehicle. Whoever this is, he's the EMPEROR...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EMERGING: MARAT BUZHAYEV. Stepping up behind him, Eli, helping King Marat. MARAT and VADIM greet each other. They KISS WARMLY. ANGLE ON BOBBY. A beat. We SEE the devastation. Almost to himself:

Then the cops spot: TWO YOUNG GRANDCHILDREN, sitting in the back of the car. They do not get out. They seem clueless.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STANDING GUARD over all of this is a LOOKOUT, who is armed with an AK-47. Several other ARMED MEN take positions closer to the structure as the FURS ARE BROUGHT IN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BUSINESSMEN make some banter, then enter the shack--led by NEZHINSKI. MARAT BUZHAYEV and ELI follow him in. Many other men pour into the structure, BRIEFCASES in hand.

<DIRECTION>
The FUR IS POKED a COUPLE OF TIMES. A beat. Then: WHITE PLUMES RISE from the coat's fabric to the top of the liquid, and Eli begins to skim the substance off the surface.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DUMPING OUT some of the substance (now in crystalline form) onto a pad, MARAT BUZHAYEV hands it to a BUSINESSMAN, who TASTES it. THE BUSINESSMAN nods, pleased with his product... He reaches for a SUITCASE. It is OPENED. Filled with MONEY.

<DIRECTION>
The COPS begin the assault, EXPLODING FROM EVERYWHERE. SIRENS, the whole thing. Bobby and Joseph get up, stand into a crouch and move slowly toward the structure. A GROUP OF ESU COPS charge MARAT'S CAR, GOING FOR THE CHILDREN--who watch this with fear and incomprehension...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An ARMED GUARD, standing outside the shack, begins to fire at the cops. EVERYONE OPENS FIRE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALL OF A SUDDEN: A COP, that TOUGH-LOOKING COP we saw at Joseph's house but a few moments earlier, is HIT by the Armed Guard's fire. HIT IN THE FACE, he falls down near Joseph and Bobby. DEAD, his visage a bloodied pulp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT ON JOSEPH. HE FREEZES. We momentarily FLASH CUT back to his OWN SHOOTING... He cannot bear reliving the terror of his moment...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the COPS move in: Bobby spins around to look for his brother. He finds him still on the ground. Joseph seems unable to move, holding onto his shotgun for dear life:
</DIRECTION>

	Joe?!

Joseph looks at his brother, shakes his head. Completely shattered in the moment. STILL. SHOTS RING OUT. Bobby pushes his brother down on the ground. In his ear:

Chaos begins. All of the men inside the small building have aimed their guns into the WEEDS. But instead of stopping because of the shooting, Bobby progresses inexorably toward the structure, his shotgun poised to fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NOW MICHAEL and JACK and OTHER MEMBERS of the NARCOTICS TEAMS come out of the WEEDS. THEY FIRE their WEAPONS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARAT'S GRANDCHILDREN are DRAGGED OUT OF THE CAR, CRYING LOUDLY...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FIFTY YARDS AWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LINE of UNIFORMED POLICE OFFICERS forms. They move in unison. Seems like a hundred men. Bobby and Jack and some of his men are coming from one side, the line from another.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SIRENS. A GUN BATTLE. The LOOKOUT with the AK-47 is hit-- fatally. Bobby SEES several people FLEEING out a back entrance toward another section of the weeds. Joseph remains in the grass, his head down, his hands on his head. We cannot SEE his face...

VADIM SCURRIES INTO THE WEEDS... THE SMALL STRUCTURE REALLY STARTS TO BURN. It is an odd flame, BLUE and SILENT.

BOBBY RUNS OFF, into THE WEEDS, following VADIM. ELI CHARGES TOWARD HIS CAR. JACK is RIGHT BEHIND HIM:

Bobby raises his shotgun as he RACES THROUGH THE PHRAGMITES GRASS. The WEEDS PART. It is TRICKY. HEAVY BREATHING. BOBBY SEES other MEN running through the weeds, but he can't tell who's who. CONFUSION...

It's MICHAEL SOLO, who, in profile to Bobby is unaware he's almost been killed. He stops when he feels the barrel of Bobby's shotgun against his ribs. SLOWLY TURNING AROUND, he sees BOBBY. WHISPERED:

All the officers back up--all of them except Bobby. Who stands, shotgun in hand, waiting for VADIM NEZHINSKI to emerge from the now-burning brush.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO OTHER MEN come out of the fire, coughing. They are carrying their guns and thus killed by POLICE GUNFIRE. NO SIGHT OF NEZHINSKI AS BOBBY WAITS. AT LAST, HE DECIDES TO GO IN.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL_SOLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bobby? What're you doin'--
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL_SOLO>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not gonna let him get away...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
AS the other POLICE panic around him, Bobby ENTERS THE FIRE...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. FIERY WEEDS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby walks through the FLAME. It is OTHERWORLDLY. The ORANGE-BLUE, the SMOKE, it all seems to blow from left to right...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHAOS of HEAT, SMOKE... We HEAR ONLY THE RUSHING WIND... BOBBY seems INCONCEIVABLY DRIVEN. Methodically stepping forward, past the FIRES, PEERING THROUGH SMOKE. NOTHING... JUST TUFTS OF SMOKE...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he spots an area in which the SMOKE FLOWS UNNATURALLY, AGAINST THE BREEZE, as though it SURGES AROUND SOMETHING... SOMETHING COVERED IN SMOKE, STANDING...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A GUST OF WIND PASSES--REVEALING--A SILHOUETTED FIGURE, WITH HIS ARM RAISED, POINTING, RIGHT AT BOBBY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VADIM NEZHINSKI, POISED TO SHOOT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Within what seems like a split second, Bobby raises his SHOTGUN and FIRES it. VADIM CRUMPLES TO THE GROUND. A DIRECT HIT to the chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby lifts his shotgun and approaches. The weeds separate, REVEALING NEZHINSKI, with a look on his face that registers a kind of shock, a shock that he's been hit. Nezhinski sees Bobby standing over him. With all the energy he has in the world:
</DIRECTION>
<VADIM_NEZHINSKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't...don't let me die in here...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VADIM_NEZHINSKI>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby stands over him for a BEAT. Then Bobby turns his back on Vadim, walks through the fires around him. As Vadim calls after him ("BOBBY!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PLEASE, DON'T LEAVE ME HERE!"), the flames begin to engulf the area where Nezhinski lies...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. FIELD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOBBY EMERGES FROM THE FIRE... HE WALKS TOWARD THE POLICE CARS. THE POLICE ARE ASSEMBLED around: MARAT BUZHAYEV. BOBBY WATCHES HIM FOR A MOMENT, HIS FACE filled with CONTROLLED RAGE. BEAT. EACH MAN STARES AT EACH OTHER. THEN:
</DIRECTION>
<MARAT_BUZHAYEV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bobby--I, I didn't know it would be your family--
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARAT_BUZHAYEV>
<DIRECTION>
BOBBY TAKES A THREATENING STEP FORWARD. Bobby's expression seems unmatched in its ferocity; Marat sees in Bobby's eyes a horrible determination, begins to cry... Bobby's emotions are a CAULDRON:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get down! On the ground!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
Marat gets on his knees. WHIMPERING. Bobby puts Marat's hands on his head, starts PATTING HIM DOWN. CLEAN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOBBY PUTS THE SHOTGUN AT MARAT'S TEMPLE. We HEAR the DOGS, the FIRE, the WIND, the SIRENS...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The police see the unforgiving expression on Bobby's face and the reality of the old man in front of them. Bobby turns to the others, particularly JACK. He looks at him, dark-eyed. Then he turns away and starts walking, making eye contact with none of them. He utters a command, to all of them and none of them in particular:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put him in the fuckin' van... Don't touch him...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby walks past the small building, which CONTINUES TO BURN SILENTLY--with that eerie BLUE FLAME... Other cops watch him with awe and respect. They back away from him. He proceeds on toward the cars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HE SEES: Joseph inside one of them, still. Staring at him. WE DOLLY WITH HIM as he moves to his brother. CROUCHES DOWN, stays by JOSEPH...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT OF AN ANNOUNCEMENT BOARD, SURROUNDED BY FLOWERS:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"ONE P.M.: N.Y.P.D. EVENT - ACADEMY GRADUATION."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. ONE POLICE PLAZA - FOYER - OUTSIDE THE AUDITORIUM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HUNDREDS OF POLICE OFFICERS, all dressed up to the nines, are HERE. White gloves and all. Milling about in a white plaster walled room. Upbeat chatter. Then: Bobby emerges through the DOORS in his DRESS BLUES. Upon seeing him, the others smile, CHEER. People touch him, shake his hand. Eye him with respect. AD-LIB GREETINGS.
</DIRECTION>
<RANDOM_OFFICERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bobby! Hey! Lookit you--six months in the Academy and already you look like a chief!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RANDOM_OFFICERS>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey everybody...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby moves toward the AUDITORIUM DOORS. Now Michael approaches. In Bobby's ear:
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL_SOLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just saw the commissioner. A lotta people're gonna wanna talk to you--important people. About maybe settin' you up with your own unit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL_SOLO>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right. We'll talk about that after.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby sees: JOSEPH, STANDING nearby with his hand on his child's shoulder, the rest of his FAMILY SURROUNDING HIM. The brothers embrace. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're getting started--we should probably go in now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. AUDITORIUM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ceremony is getting underway. As Bobby and Joseph move past the seated crowd toward their chairs in front:
</DIRECTION>
<JOSEPH_GRUSINSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, I think Pop would be real happy to see you like this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSEPH_GRUSINSKY>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
(slight ironic laugh)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think he'd believe it... But I guess things don't always go the way you think they will.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<JOSEPH_GRUSINSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, the Force'll treat you good. I'm sure you do very well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSEPH_GRUSINSKY>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You definitely gonna leave? Ain't no way you change your mind?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<JOSEPH_GRUSINSKY>
<DIRECTION>
(shakes head; then:)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the right thing. It's over for me--I'm out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSEPH_GRUSINSKY>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, we'll spend some more time together from now on. Okay? I'll come over next week.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<JOSEPH_GRUSINSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Arright, yeah. Sounds good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSEPH_GRUSINSKY>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby approaches the POLICE CHAPLAIN, hands him a note.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chaplain? I'd like you to introduce me this way. If you don't mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
The CHAPLAIN looks at the paper, nods. He then walks to the podium. Bobby sits as the Chaplain begins:
</DIRECTION>
<POLICE_CHAPLAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ladies and gentlemen: we shall begin today's ceremony with the traditional invocation, moving then to the valedictorian address to be given by...Robert Grusinsky. Son of the late Deputy Chief Albert Grusinsky, brother of Captain Joseph Grusinsky.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POLICE_CHAPLAIN>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON BOBBY as his REAL NAME is SPOKEN:
</DIRECTION>
<POLICE_CHAPLAIN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, as I look at this fine young man seated here, I can't help but think about all the young members of our department. I get filled with such pride.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(BEAT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Men like him are the great future of our Force...
	</DIALOGUE>
</POLICE_CHAPLAIN>
<DIRECTION>
As the man speaks, Bobby SCANS the room. HE SEES ROSARIO, standing in the crowd behind the seated audience. Her face is partially obscured. BOBBY CANNOT BELIEVE THE FLOOD OF EMOTION that overwhelms him, the happiness he feels upon catching a glimpse of her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But just as quickly as this thrill grabs him, it disappears when she becomes completely visible; for he realizes that IT IS NOT HER but rather a young woman who bears merely a faint resemblance... Joseph interrupts this, leans over:
</DIRECTION>
<JOSEPH_GRUSINSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you, Bobby.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSEPH_GRUSINSKY>
<BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
(back to reality)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Love you too, Joe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY_GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
Police line up on the stage. Everyone's seated, Bobby and Joseph in front. The POLICE BAND begins to play the drums. Bobby straightens up, raises his hand--along with the sea of blue--in a SALUTE as the flag is carried to the front.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
