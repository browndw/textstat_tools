:SC: HANNAH AND HER SISTERS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the last credit appears, the song ends in a crescendo and the screen fades to total black.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Immediately, a new melody begins, an uptempo jazz number, as a title appears on the screen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"God, she's beautiful...".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HANNAH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A full face of Lee, wearing a gray sweater and leaning against the dining room doorway. She gazes into the camera with a half-smile on her face as Elliot speaks over the screen.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God, she's beautiful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
Lee glances over her shoulder, then turns from the doorway and walks away. The camera follows her, moving across a book-and-photograph-filled bookshelf that obscures her from view as she walks into a crowded, comfortable vestibule. People, some holding drinks, some just entering the apartment, surround her. Everyone is talking at once, carrying on easy, familiar conversation.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's got the prettiest eyes, and she looks so sexy in that sweater.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
Lee smiles at the various people, exchanging greetings.
</DIRECTION>
<LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, how are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<DIRECTION>
Two more guests enter the apartment; the vestibule is full now. Still walking, Lee lightly hugs one of the children as she continues on her way towards the living room. Elliot's voice, as well as the jazzy music, is heard.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just want to be alone with her and hold her and kiss her...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
Lee walks into the living room, turning her head back for a moment to talk to the child she has just hugged.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and tell her how much I love her and take care of her. Stop it, you idiot. She's your wife's sister. But I can't help it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
The camera is still moving with Lee as she smiles and stops to chat with her mother. Elliot's voice, as well as the music, continues over the low din of warm conversation.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm consumed by her. It's been months now. I dream about her. I- I, I think about her at the office. Oh, Lee.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(sighing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What am I gonna do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
Lee starts to walk off again, finishing her conversation with her mother. She passes several other guests, then turns to greet April, giving her a warm, brief hug.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hear myself mooning over you, and it's disgusting. Before, when she...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
Elliot's voice-over continues as he is actually seen, standing in a doorway having a conversation with a gesturing, rotund man. Both are holding drinks as Lee, carrying a tray of hors d'oeuvres and two drinks, walks between them. The space is very tight; the men hold up their drinks to make room for her.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...squeezed past me in the doorway, and I smelled that perfume on the back of her neck...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
Elliot watches Lee walk off; the other man, oblivious, continues to talk. Elliot reluctantly returns to the conversation, but he can't help turning his head to gaze at the offscreen Lee as the other man chatters on.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Jesus, I, I thought I was gonna swoon! Easy...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
The camera resumes following a smiling Lee. She has just put down the tray and drinks near April, and briskly and obliviously, she walks past a doorway where Elliot, still ruminating, watches her, entranced.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a dignified financial advisor. It doesn't look good for you to swoon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
The camera stays with Elliot, who is still watching the offscreen Lee. In the background, guests continue to chatter warmly with each other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hannah, carrying a tray of hors d'oeuvres, walks up behind the distracted Elliot.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
(nibbling on an hors d'oeuvre)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Elliot? Elliot?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(rubbing his shoulder)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sweetheart?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
Elliot returns from his reveries with a start.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(turning to Hannah)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mm-hm?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing to the tray)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you tried these? These are wonderful.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(nibbling, swallowing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holly and her friend made them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
Elliot, taking one of the hors d'oeuvres, starts nibbling as well as he and Hannah walk past the bookshelf into the living room.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(swallowing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're fantastic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
(overlapping, still eating)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aren't they great?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH>
<ELLIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your sister is an unbelievable cook.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
(swallowing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know! I know!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
Elliot and Hannah, eating and talking, walk past a hallway and offscreen as Holly appears, walking down the hallway. She holds a drink and a plate of hors d'oeuvres; she stands at the entrance to the hallway, eating and looking at the offscreen guests.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
(walking offscreen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She has all the cooking talent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(walking offscreen swallowing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, she doesn't, either. You've got tons as well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
(offscreen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ohhh, but I've eaten five of these.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
Holly, standing in the hallway onscreen, swallows loudly.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(offscreen, overlapping Holly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holly, why don't you open your own restaurant?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(turning to the
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	offscreen Elliot and
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Hannah, trying to swallow)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mmm, we practically are. Well...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(holding her hand to her mouth)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	not a restaurant, but...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(swallowing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	April and I are going to do some catering!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
(offscreen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? You're kidding!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(nodding)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no, we decided!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
Holly takes a sip of her drink as Hannah and Elliot walk over to her.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perfect!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(nodding and swallowing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mmm...I mean, we love to cook for our friends, so
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(gesturing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	we thought until an acting job comes through, we could just make some extra money, you know, doing a few private parties.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(nodding)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great idea.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
(agreeing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(overlapping Hannah)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's where your talent lies.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(swallowing and nodding)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
Holly and Hannah begin to laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(gesturing to Elliot, still laughing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get outta here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Hannah)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could I speak to you privately?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<HANNAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
Holly and Hannah walk off; Elliot watches them leave.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(calling after them
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	as he nibbles on an
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
hors d'oeuvre)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm her husband! She tells me anything!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HANNAH'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hannah, licking her fingers, walks past a memo-cluttered refrigerator to the stove as Holly, behind her, begins to speak. The faint sounds of music are still heard.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hannah, I have to borrow some more money.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(sipping her drink)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't get upset.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
(stirring some food in a saucepan on the stove)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mmm, I never get upset over that. Mmm?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH>
<HOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the last time, I promise. And I'm keeping strict accounts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
As Holly talks, sipping her drink, Hannah busily works in the kitchen, which contains a large center table stacked with bowls and plates of food, hanging pots and pans, and general party clutter. She walks on-and-offscreen as she talks and listens to her sister.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holly, please. Don't insult me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(putting her empty
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	glass and plate down
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
on the table)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Someday, I'll pay it all back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<HANNAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. H-how much do you need?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH>
<HOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two thousand dollars.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
Hannah, who'd been mashing some food in a bowl on a nearby counter, hesitates momentarily. She turns to Holly.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
(trying to nod her head casually)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh-huh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(gesturing, her back to the camera)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hannah, I know it's a lot, but my friend April and I, we have this catering idea I think's going to be great.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
Hannah, licking her fingers, walks past Holly.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(turning to face Hannah)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You admit that we're great cooks, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
(nodding, back at the
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	stove now, stirring
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
in a pot)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(putting her hands in her pockets)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, in order to get started, there's just a few things I have to buy...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(gesturing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	and some old debts I have outstanding.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
(looking at her sister)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you just tell me one thing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(nodding)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<HANNAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are we talking about cocaine again?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(shaking her head no)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I swear. I swear. We've already got some requests to do a few dinner parties.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
A timer goes off. Hannah walks past Holly to attend to some food on a different stove. Holly turns to face her. Only Holly is seen as she talks to the offscreen Hannah, the camera moving in closer on her face. As Holly speaks, she distractedly nibbles an hors d'oeuvre. In the background, her parents can be heard singing in the living room.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, obviously, I'm not going to be a caterer forever, you know. We both still go to auditions. Something could turn up at any moment. But the parties are at night, days are free, I can still take my acting class. I haven't done drugs on a year.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
Holly pops another hors d'oeuvre into her mouth as the background singing gets louder and the film cuts to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HANNAH'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The living room is crowded with family and guests sitting comfortably on chairs near the piano, where Evan, Hannah's father, plays "Bewitched" as Hannah's mother, Norma, sits nearby, accompanying him in their duet. A child is sprawled out under a blanket on a sofa; some guests chatter quietly; others drink and eat, listening.
</DIRECTION>
<EVAN_NORMA>
<DIRECTION>
(singing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"A whimpering, simpering Child again Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered Am I..."
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVAN_NORMA>
<DIRECTION>
As they continue to sing, the film cuts back to the kitchen, where Lee, carrying some glasses, enters through the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mom and Dad are floating down memory lane again!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<DIRECTION>
Lee walks over to her sisters, putting the glasses down on a counter. Hannah is scooping seeds out of a cantaloupe. Holly, leaning on the table, sips her drink. The music from the living room is softly heard as the three sisters chat comfortably and easily with each other.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling and turning to Lee)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aah... Hey, have you tried Holly and her friend's shrimp puffs?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH>
<LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(nodding to Holly, touching her arm)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think they're fantastic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
(to Holly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've outdone yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(overlapping her
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	sisters, shrugging
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
and smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, my God. Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(interrupting, to Hannah)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need an antihistamine. Mom thinks she's feeling her asthma, and so...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
(overlapping)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ohh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(overlapping, lighting a cigarette)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh-oh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...before she starts turning into Camille...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(laughing)
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(overlapping)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, Mom's Camille when she gets up in the morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(turning to Holly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At least she isn't drinking. Did you notice?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(nodding)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mm-hm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
(turning to look at her sisters, laughing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doesn't she look great in that new dress?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(nodding)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(nodding)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<DIRECTION>
The sisters all talk at once; Hannah is still working at the sink.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you think she does?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH>
<HOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She really does, though.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(turning towards the sink)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, she knows it, too, 'cause she's flirting with all the men here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(puffing on her cigarette)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
(scooping out some cantaloupe seeds)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe when she's eighty, she'll stop straightening her garter belt when there's a guy around.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(to Lee, laughing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I should get a garter belt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(laughing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(looking down at herself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get a garter belt...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(sipping her drink)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get a garter belt and flirt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(laughing, to Hannah)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are the antihistamines?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<HANNAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I don-- Ask Elliot for that. Uh, he's got them somewhere.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH>
<LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(nodding)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<DIRECTION>
Lee leaves the kitchen. Holly, puffing on her cigarette, watches her go.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(sighing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frederick didn't come with her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
(turning to Holly, still working at the sink)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When does Frederick ever come with her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering intently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tch. He's such an angry...he's such a depressive. I thought she was moving out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
Hannah shakes her head in disapproval while Holly angrily takes another sip of her drink.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And the film cuts briefly back to the living room, where Evan is still playing the piano and singing. The camera moves past him and a few guests to Norma, who is enthusiastically singing along, looking at Evan and moving her hands.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HANNAH'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The table is beautifully set for Thanksgiving dinner, complete with candles, flowers, cut crystal, china, and silver. Hannah's children are playing in the room as Hannah enters, carrying a huge roast turkey. Behind her is Holly, carrying a casserole. Hannah's parents can still be heard singing in the background.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNAH>

(setting down the

	turkey on the opposite

end of the table)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, gosh. Well, you know, that's why I invited Phil Gammage tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
As the sisters talk, the piano music stops. There's the sound of light applause as Evan begins a new song, faintly heard in the dining room.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(grimacing, reacting to Hannah)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Hannah!

(handing a pack of matches to Holly)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you light those, please? He's-he's-he's not a dope addict or anything.

The camera moves with April as she walks over to the table, where Hannah and Holly are lighting candles.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe April would like Phil. Phil Gammage, the tall guy in there by the piano.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
Holly groans, looking at her sister, while April sips her drink and nods.
</DIRECTION>
<APRIL>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Hm-mm. Oh, yeah. I met Phil.

	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
Hannah screams with laughter as she walks toward the end of the table, past a gleeful Holly, who points her finger at Hannah as she passes. Hannah, still laughing, playfully pushes the accusing finger away.
</DIRECTION>
<APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
(laughing with the sisters, gesturing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love that. That's my type.

<HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
(shaking her head, laughing)
</DIRECTION>

She walks over to a nearby china cabinet.

	<DIALOGUE>
	No, really, we mustn't get discouraged.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
As Holly continues to tease her sister, Hannah opens a drawer in the cabinet. She takes out two apples decorated with paper turkey heads and tails and hands them to April.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(fussing at the table)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

April starts to put the turkey apples on the table. A bemused Hannah takes two more out of the cabinet and places one of them on the table as well.

</HANNAH>
<HOLLY>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe at Christmas, New Year's. If not this New Year's, maybe next New Year's.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
While Holly is talking, Hannah hands her the last turkey apple, accidentally sticking her with one of the toothpicks that keeps the decorations in place.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(reacting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ouch!

</HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
The film cuts to a short hallway leading to a bathroom in Hannah's apartment. In the foreground is a standing lamp. In the background, Elliot is seen walking inside the bathroom, looking around the room. Light piano music is dimly heard.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(searching)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Must be here someplace.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
He walks out of the bathroom, moving down the hallway towards the camera.

<LEE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, you know, I, I love that book you lent me. The Easter Parade? You were right. It had very special meaning for me.

</LEE>
<ELLIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's Frederick? He didn't come.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
Elliot walks into the bedroom as Lee continues to talk offscreen. The camera, leaving Elliot, moves across the room, past a wall of framed paintings, a headboard and bed, a night table and lamp, revealing Lee. She is flipping through a book by a curtained window.
</DIRECTION>
<LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(offscreen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, well, you know Frederick. One of his moods. Although it wasn't a bad week. He

	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, great.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
The camera stays with Lee as she walks around the room, past another curtained window, a television set, and a rolltop desk. She absently flips through the book as she talks to the offscreen Elliot.
</DIRECTION>
<LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, it was, it was one of his better drawings, a very beautiful nude study. Actually, it was of me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(laughing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's funny, you know, it's a funny feeling to know you're being hung naked in some stranger's living room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<DIRECTION>
Lee puts the book she's been holding down on the desk, only to pick up another one. She looks at the offscreen Elliot.
</DIRECTION>
<LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you can't tell it's me, although--
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pausing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're turning all red, Elliot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<DIRECTION>
She reacts. The camera moves to a blushing Elliot, following him now as he walks across the room.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(laughing self-consciously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? So, so, what else? Wh- what are you up to?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(offscreen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I don't know. My unemployment checks are running out. Um, I was thinking of taking some courses at Columbia with the last of my savings.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<DIRECTION>
As Lee speaks, Elliot parts a hanging curtain against the wall to reveal a stereo and some records. He looks at the offscreen Lee.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like, uh...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(offscreen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know exactly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<DIRECTION>
As Elliot reaches inside the stereo shelf, grabbing a bottle of antihistamines, the camera moves back to Lee, who sits down on the bed. She is still holding a book.
</DIRECTION>
<LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, sociology, psychology maybe. I always thought I might like to work with children.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<DIRECTION>
Elliot walks over to Lee; he sits down on a footstool in front of her.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(gesturing with the
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	bottle of pills
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
gripped in his hand)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Incidentally, I-I always have clients who are furnishing places. Some of them might-might be interested in buying art. Shall I, shall I call you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(chuckling self-consciously)
</DIRECTION>
<LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(taking the bottle of pills Elliot hands her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, uh, Frederick would really by grateful for a sale.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>

She chuckles; Elliot smiles and chuckles with her.

<DIRECTION>
INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone is seated around the table for Thanksgiving dinner. Facing the camera are Holly, Lee, Norma, and Hannah. She sits to the left of Elliot, who's at the head of the table. On his right is Evan; April sits next to him. She and the other guests sit with their backs to the screen. The table overflows with food, floral decorations, and candles. In the background, the children sit at a separate table; a maid serves them turkey. The guests chatter comfortably among themselves as they eat.
</DIRECTION>
<EVAN>
<DIRECTION>
(clanking a piece of
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	silverware against
	</DIALOGUE>

</EVAN>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad.

Evan continues to clank his glass to get everyone's attention.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLY>

</EVAN>
<HOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm starving!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
Resigned, Holly puts down her silverware. Lee smothers a laugh. Norma, reacting, glances at Holly and Lee. Everyone knows what's coming.
</DIRECTION>
<EVAN>
<DIRECTION>
(clanking away)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...this is a toast! This is a toast.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVAN>
<HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
(reaching across the
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	table for Evan's wine
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
glass, laughing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get his wine away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH>
<EVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is a toast. You know this beautiful Thanksgiving dinner was all...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVAN>
<DIRECTION>
Holly laughs. Lee glances over to her, reacting. Hannah, embarrassed, reacts and sits with her hands on her face. Lee and the rest of the guests put down their silverware. They look at Evan, listening.
</DIRECTION>
<EVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...prepared...by Hannah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVAN>
<DIRECTION>
Hannah, embarrassed, makes a victory sign.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
(modestly pointing to the maid)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, and a little help...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
Lee and Holly try to suppress their laughter. Norma glares at them.
</DIRECTION>
<NORMA>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORMA>
<HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...from Mavis, also.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
Elliot wraps his arm around Hannah; he pulls her towards him affectionately and kisses her on the cheek. She hugs him back.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(hugging Hannah)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You bet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
(overlapping, looking
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
still in Elliot's embrace)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holly and April, thanks for helping.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
Mavis the maid exits, carrying some trays, as the group starts to cheer and applaud. Holly waves her napkin at April, then holds up her wine glass.
</DIRECTION>
<EVAN>
<DIRECTION>
(overlapping the noise)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you did it.
	</DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH>
<EVAN>
<DIRECTION>
(overlapping, holding out his wine glass)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And we drink to her, and we all congratulate her on her wonderful accomplishment during this last year...her great success in A Doll's House!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVAN>
<DIRECTION>
The group continues to cheer as they all toast Hannah. She reacts, smiling but embarrassed.
</DIRECTION>
<NORMA>
<DIRECTION>
(overlapping, laughing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ya-a-a-a-y!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(laughing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I played Nora. I hate to tell you what year...
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORMA>
<DIRECTION>
The guests, sipping their wine, quiet down as Norma continues to speak. Lee and Holly unsuccessfully try to contain their laughter. Mavis reenters the dining room to serve more food to the children.
</DIRECTION>
<NORMA>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And it's very difficult to behave like Torvald's little chipmunk without making a perfect ass out of yourself!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pausing while the guests laugh heartily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now I think that Ibsen would have been damn proud of our Hannah!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORMA>
<DIRECTION>
Norma toasts her daughter; everyone follows her. The applause and cheers begin anew. Hannah, reacting, chuckles.
</DIRECTION>
<APRIL>

<NORMA>

(overlapping)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yea-a-a-a-ah!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORMA>
<DIRECTION>
A few guests sip their wine. They all quiet down as Hannah starts her speech, glancing around the table and gesturing.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
(reacting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know about that. Oh, no, I just, see, I-I've been very, very lucky. W-when I had the kids, I decided to stop working and just, you know, devote myself to having the family, and I've been very, very happy
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(banging her fists lightly on the table)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	but...I've always secretly hoped that maybe some little gem would come along and tempt me back on the stage...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH>
<EVAN>
<DIRECTION>
(nodding)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVAN>
<HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
(overlapping)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...just for a second. So, now I got that out of my system and I can go back to the thing that makes me happiest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
Hannah tenderly takes Elliot's hand as she looks around the table. He, in turn, kneads her shoulder, chuckling with equal tenderness.
</DIRECTION>
<EVAN>
<DIRECTION>
(chuckling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, bravo! Bravo!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVAN>
<DIRECTION>
Hannah, still embarrassed, looks down at a plate. The group applauds once more, toasting and drinking, and warmly sounding their approval.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"We all had a terrific time."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Classical string music plays as the film cuts to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A taxi moves down Broadway towards the camera, passing a truck on the right, the Winter Garden marquee advertising Cats, and several buildings, and as the taxi moves offscreen, the classical music still playing, the movie cuts to the taxi's backseat. Lee sits by the window, leaning her head in her hand, a reflective look on her face. Her voice is heard over the screen.
</DIRECTION>
<LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it my imagination, or does Elliot have a little crush on me?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(chuckling slightly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's funny. I've had that thought before. He pays a lot of attention to me all the time, and he blushed tonight when we were alone in the bedroom. I wonder if he and Hannah are happy? It's funny, I...I still feel a little buzz from his flirting.

CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FREDERICK'S LOFT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lee stirs a cup of coffee on the counter of the loft's modern kitchen area; a nearby vase hold flowers. She walks across the loft, with its high ceilings and beige walls, holding her coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(to an offscreen Frederick)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Want some coffee or tea?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<FREDERICK>
<DIRECTION>
(offscreen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDERICK>
<DIRECTION>
Lee continues to walk, past a modern chaise, a bookcase, some sofas, two columns. Lamps hang down from the ceiling. The classical music still plays in the background. Lee stops at a plastic-enclosed work area. Frederick can be seen working at a drawing board on the other side of the clear plastic screen.
</DIRECTION>
<LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(stirring her coffee)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about something to eat?

The background music stops.

(walking around the screen to Frederick)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mmm, what am I gonna do with you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(laughing)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Lee walks over to the drawing board where Frederick is sitting, he is seen intently cleaning some paintbrushes with a rag. Lee stands by him, leaning over the board, and looks directly at him. The table is filled with cans of brushes and artist's equipment.
</DIRECTION>
<LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(sniffing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And why didn't you come tonight? We all had a terrific time. I really think you would have enjoyed yourself.

</LEE>
<FREDERICK>
<DIRECTION>
(not looking at Lee)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going through a period of my life where I just can't be around people.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	brushes and wiping his hands with the
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
same rag)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't want to wind up abusing anyone.

</FREDERICK>
<LEE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're too harsh with everyone. You know that, don't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<DIRECTION>
Frederick and Lee embrace; Lee sighs.
</DIRECTION>
<FREDERICK>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Isn't it enough that I can love you?

INT. TV STUDIO CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Metal elevator doors open and Mickey Sachs, a high-powered television producer, walks out, deep in conversation with his assistants, Paul and Larry. As the elevator operator begins to reclose the door with his passengers, Mickey, his assistants fast behind, walks down an office corridor past busy groups of studio personnel. Indistinct conversation, as well as the jazz, is heard in the background as the trio talk.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>

The trio pass Mary, another assistant, in conversation with two other co-workers. She holds a clipboard.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But we showed it to them in rehearsal!

</MICKEY>

Without missing a beat, he takes Mary's wrist and continues walking.

	You know, what'd they do, figure out what the words mean?

A foursome now, they briskly walk past a man and a woman going over a script. Mary and Mickey lead; Paul and Larry follow.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>

As the group walks through a large doorway, Larry catches up to Mickey.

<LARRY>

	We're short! The show is five minutes short!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARRY>
<DIRECTION>
The group turns right into a new corridor, briefly off the screen. As they scurry off, their voices are heard.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>

They are all now seen walking down the new corridor towards the camera. The corridor is crowded with busy TV personnel. The group continues to talk frantically as people hurry past them. One man pushes rudely past Mary as he walks; she looks back at him briefly.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...pull out the sketch, then we'll be ten minutes short!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<MICKEY>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know how they can do that to us. That's-- We go on in thirty minutes, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
Mary checks her wristwatch as they rush down the corridor.
</DIRECTION>
<LARRY>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Mickey!

</GAIL>
<DIRECTION>
Gail runs in front of the group. Without missing a step, she faces Mickey and walks backwards, gesturing and talking frantically.
</DIRECTION>
<GAIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mickey! Listen, we better go right to Ronny's dressing room. This kid must have taken sixteen hundred Quaaludes. I don't think he's going to be able to do the show!

The fast-tracking group turns the corner. Gail pats Mickey's back; she gestures in exasperation.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why me, Lord? What did I--
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
He is interrupted by Ed Smythe, an official from the Standards and Practices Department, who's been standing in the corridor waiting for Mickey. Mickey stops and shakes Ed's hand as if he'd known the official would be there. Gail stops by his side while the others walk into a background studio doorway that is busy with scurrying personnel.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, you're crazy! It's not so delicate. Everybody's married to every line.

Mickey, still in surprised shock, turns away from the angry writer. He stands by an open dressing room, where Ron, an actor, slouches, dazed, in a chair facing a makeup mirror. People mill in the background behind the actor.

An uptempo big-band sound is heard as the movie cuts to Mickey's examination, beginning with a close-up of Dr. Abel using an otoscope to examine the ear of a nervous Mickey. Next is a hearing test. The film shows the doctors's hands turning the dials on a sonometer. Mickey sits on a nearby high stool, large earphones on his head. He listens with such concentration that he squints his eyes. He holds up a finger in response to the sounds he hears in his headset. Finally, the film shows Dr. Abel hitting a large turning fork with his finger. He puts the vibrating fork to Mickey's ear. Mickey, looking up at the offscreen doctor's face, nods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The music stops as the film cuts back to Dr. Abel's consultation room. Dr. Abel walks from the examining room, through the consultation room, to a second examining room across the way. He talks to the offscreen Mickey as he walks.

Looking preoccupied, Dr. Abel walks back into the consultation room, holding Mickey's open file. He strides over to his desk, revealing a frightened Mickey, sitting in a chair opposite it. Still standing, the doctor leans over the desk, his back to the camera, and makes a few notes in the file.

(to two male guests in her way)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
One of the men, murmuring his thanks, takes a last shrimp puff as Holly passes.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(to the man)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
Holly finally makes her way into the cluttered loft kitchen. Her tray is empty.
</DIRECTION>
<APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
(offscreen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Stroganoff is ready.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
Holly, excited, runs over to April, who is busy taking the Stroganoff out of the oven. She wears the same uniform as Holly: black skirt, white shirt, and black bowtie.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(animatedly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're a big hit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, in this we're a big hit. Yesterday I auditioned for Come Back Little Sheba. That, I wasn't such a big hit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
April, holding the Stroganoff, dashes out of the kitchen to serve the party guests. Holly calls after her, offscreen, as David walks past the hurrying April into the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(offscreen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You will be. You will be. You'll get five jobs next week.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
David walks over to Holly, who is busy at the pot-and-pan- covered stove.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(to Holly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me, are there any more claims?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(gesturing at some
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	canapés warming on
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
the stove)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only a few. A few.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(chuckling as David takes one)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you like 'em?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't resist.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(busily working at the stove)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? How flattering! Did you try the shrimp puffs?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(eating a canapé and pointing at Holly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers. Something's wrong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<HOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're actresses.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this your first job?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(grabbing a quiche from an overhead stove)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? Is the food that bad?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(shaking his head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh no. Not at all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
As Holly carries the quiche outside to the party, April comes back into the kitchen from another doorway. Music, as well as the chatter of mingling guests, is heard in the background.
</DIRECTION>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We need more bread and some baked lasa--
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(realizing Holly
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	isn't there and, at the same time,
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
noticing David)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	uh, lasagne.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turning to David)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(standing by the sink
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	as he wipes his hands
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
and mouth with a napkin)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. You're an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
(working at the
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	stove, pointing a
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
finger for emphasis)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, no, the shrimp puffs are Holly's. I do the, uh, crêpes caviar.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
She walks past David to a counter where she begins to fold napkins. David leans back against the sink.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the quail is responsible for the quail eggs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
(turning to David and chuckling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, let's hope so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
Holly enters the kitchen holding out a plate of clams. She walks over to David.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here, I stole you a couple of extra clams.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(taking the plate)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah!
	</DIALOGUE>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(looking busily around the room)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(overlapping, gesturing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Incidentally, I'm David Tolchin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
(turning to David)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, uh, April Knox. Hi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
They shake hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(looking at her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
(leaving the counter
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	and squeezing past
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
David and Holly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(overlapping, moving out of April's way)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
April walks offscreen to another area of the kitchen. Holly picks up a napkin from the crowded table.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(overlapping Holly's apology, turning to her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're Holly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(nodding, looking at
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	David as she wipes
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
her hands with the napkin)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, we're the Stanislavski Catering Company.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(chewing on a clam canapé)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now I'm going to tell you the truth. I really came in here because I was bored stiff by the party.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(laughing, still wiping her hands)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What makes you think we're more interesting?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
David walks around the table, putting the plate of clams down on the already crowded surface. Holly follows him, chuckling, throwing her napkin into an offscreen garbage can as David stops at a small television set near the doorway. Guests in the other room can be seen chatting together in clusters.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(turning on the set)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, I'm going to listen to Aida, if I'm not getting in your way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
Canned laughter and miscellaneous chatter is heard from the television set. David watches the set, still munching on a clam, while Holly and April reassure him offscreen.
</DIRECTION>
<APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
(offscreen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No...no. No--
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(sniffing)
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(offscreen, overlapping)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not at all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
David checks his wristwatch as Holly walks over to him.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(gesturing, fiddling with another napkin)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We saw, um, Pavarotti, eh, uh, in Ernani at the Met, and I cried...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(nodding, his hand
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	still on his watch as
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
he looks at Holly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I cry at the opera.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
(offscreen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I-I-I go limp in the last scene in La Traviata. Limp.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
Holly chuckles as David, listening to April, impressed, walks over to her. She is standing by the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(nodding, to April)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me, too. I have a private box at the Met.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(gesturing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I bring my little bottle of wine, I open it, I sit there and I watch and
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(glancing over to the offscreen Holly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I cry. It's disgusting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
April chuckles as Holly walks back onscreen; she is busy preparing another tray of hors d'oeuvres.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(gesturing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, what, what do you do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(nodding)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm an architect.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wha--
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turning to glance at Holly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What kind of things do you build?
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you really interested?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(nodding)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What time do you get off?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
The three exchange glances. Holly shrugs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A contemporary red building, designed by David, is seen, squeezed in between two older buildings. Holly, April, and David talk offscreen.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(offscreen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow, it's the red one?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
(offscreen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, it's magnificent!
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(offscreen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(offscreen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's terrific!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
The film moves down from the buildings to reveal the trio sitting in David's Jaguar across the street. David and April sit in the front seat; Holly sits scrunched up in back, her head slightly forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(gesturing, looking
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	back and forth from the buildings to
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Holly and April)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The design's deliberately noncontextural. But I wanted to... keep the atmosphere of the street, you know, and the proportions.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(nodding)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh-huh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And in the material. That's...that's unpolished red granite.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pausing as he
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	watches Holly and
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
April's reaction)
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
(overlapping)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, is that what it is?
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(starting to speak)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh--
	</DIALOGUE>
<APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
(interrupting, nodding at Holly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I-i-it has an o-organic quality, you know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(nodding, overlapping)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
(looking back at the building with reverence)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's almost...almost, uhhh, entirely wholly interdependent, if you know what I mean. I-I... I can't put it into words. The important thing is-is-is it-it breathes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(turning to April, emphatically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, April, people pass by vital structures in this city all the time, and they never take the time to appreciate them. I get the feeling you tune in to your environment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
(shaking her head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh--
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(interrupting, gesturing and nodding)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, it's really important.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
David turns and briefly glances at Holly; he then turns back to April.
</DIRECTION>
<APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
(looking only at David)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are your favorite buildings, David?
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to see some?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
(nodding)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, let's do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
(looking at David)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
David starts the car and the movie cuts to an unfolding visual excursion through New York City's landmark buildings, as seen from the trio's point of view in the moving Jaguar. Inspiring classical music plays in the background.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The series of shots includes the Dakota, complete with surrounding winter trees, the Graybar building on Lexington Avenue, an incredibly ornate building on Seventh Avenue and Fifty-eighth Street, a red-stone church, an old building with embellished, bulging windows on West Forty-fourth Street, the Art Deco Chrysler Building, a red-brick building, Abigail Adams's old stone house, and the Pomander Walk nestled off Broadway on the Upper West Side. The group can be seen walking down the path between the old-fashioned row houses and shrubbery. A lamppost sits in the foreground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is now dark. The music continues to play as the film cuts to the façade of a rococo-style building, complete with French doors and ornate windows. The admiring group is heard offscreen.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(offscreen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, it's just so romantic. I just want to put on a long gown...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(offscreen, overlapping)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(offscreen, continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and open the French doors and go on the balcony --
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
(offscreen, interrupting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's French, though. It really is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(offscreen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
(offscreen, overlapping)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It feels like you're in France.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(offscreen, overlapping)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It-it is. It's romantic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
The music stops. The screen, which has been exploring the rococo building's façade, now shows the equally elegant building alongside it.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(offscreen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And it's got a handsome partner sitting right beside it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(offscreen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(offscreen, overlapping)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They fit right in together. And your eye goes along, lulled into complacency, and then...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
The film moves from the two elegant façade to show an ugly, ultra-modern structure covered with tiny, diamond-shaped motifs.
</DIRECTION>
<APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
(offscreen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's just --
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(offscreen, interrupting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(offscreen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's disgusting!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
(offscreen, continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...a monstrosity! Who would do that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(offscreen, overlapping)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's really terrible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(offscreen, emphatically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's really sad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(offscreen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And it ruins everything else.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(offscreen, agreeing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It does.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
The film moves from the ugly façade to the building's equally ugly entrance. A large car is parked right in front of the building.
</DIRECTION>
<APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
(offscreen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well...we have seen a lot of stuff today, though.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(offscreen, chuckling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(offscreen, overlapping)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
(offscreen, overlapping)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A lot of works.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
The group is now seen walking down the canopied entrance stairs of an apartment house on the other side of the street, where they'd been gazing at both the lovely and ugly façades across the way. David is in the lead; the women follow, Holly slightly behind April.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(nodding)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(glancing at his watch)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe we should start thinking about going home, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<HOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fast.

</HOLLY>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, geez, yeah.

</APRIL>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(overlapped)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.

</HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
They walk towards the car.

<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(looking back at the
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	women as he walks around the car to the
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
driver's side)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, who gets dropped first?

</DAVID>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh --

<HOLLY>

<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(glancing at April)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I, we both live downtown.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
David leans over the roof of the car, looking at the women, waiting for their decision.
</DIRECTION>
<APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
(gesturing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh...
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>

	It depends on what way you want to go.

<APRIL>

</APRIL>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(overlapping, nodding)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We could...we could do that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(nodding)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. Yeah, but Fifth is so jammed, isn't it?

</HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at David.

<APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
(overlapping, to Holly)

	Well, sometimes, some, uh...
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(interrupting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, it's jammed. If we went... um...

</HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
Both she and April mumble awkwardly.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>

They get into the car. Once again Holly's in the backseat. The classical music begins anew.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The movie cuts briefly to cut to the traffic and lights of a Manhattan avenue as seen from the moving Jaguar. It then moves to a close-up of Holly, sitting in the backseat, her head near the window. She is staring straight ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Naturally I get taken home first. Well, obviously he prefers April. Of course I was so tongue-tied all night. I can't believe I said that about the Guggenheim. My stupid little roller-skating joke. I should never tell jokes. Mom can tell 'em and Hannah, but I kill 'em.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(glaring at the offscreen April's back)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where did April come up with that stuff about Adolph Loos and terms like "organic form"?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looking out the side window, pausing for a moment)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, naturally. She went to Brandeis.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
The movie cuts to Holly's point of view: the front seat where David and April sit, the Jaguar's windshield, and the passing lights and traffic of the street. Holly continues her ruminations as April leans over to say something to David.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I don't think she knows what she's talking about. Could you believe the way she was calling him David? "Yes, David. I feel that way, too, David. What a marvelous space, David."
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(emphatically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hate April. She's pushy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
The film moves back to Holly in the backseat, still lost in thought.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now they'll dump me and she'll invite him up. I blew it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(sighing, looking out the side window)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I really like him a lot. Oh, screw it. I'm not gonna get all upset. I've got reading to do tonight. You know, maybe I'll get into bed early. I'll turn to a movie and take an extra Seconal.

The classical music stops and some uptempo jazz begins. The screen cuts to black and a title appears.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET OUTSIDE FREDERICK'S LOFT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The movie briefly holds on a ripped, red, paint-splattered door as Elliot, wearing a raincoat, appears nearby. He looks down the street and the film cuts to his point of view: Frederick's loft building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The movie goes back to the impatient Elliot; he's looking around him. He glances at his watch as the film cuts back once again to the loft building, where Lee finally appears, walking down the street away from Elliot. A truck passes down the street. Lee doesn't see him. She walks further and further away; she turns a corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elliot frantically looks around again; then, in a burst of decision, he runs around a garbage dump, crossing the street, and still running, he moves down an adjacent street, past The Canal Lumber Company and several other buildings, as the film cuts back to Lee, walking down a different street, oblivious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The jazz plays on as the movie cuts back and forth between the fast-moving Elliot, rushing down the SoHo streets, past a truck waiting for a light to change, past some pedestrians, some garbage cans, turning corners, and the strolling Lee, walking up different streets, past different buildings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lee eventually crosses a street, lost in thought, looking right and left, as Elliot, pretending nonchalance, waits on the corner, looking at his watch. She looks up in surprise; the music stops.
</DIRECTION>

They begin to walk again as the movie cuts to the interior of the Pageant Book & Print Shop, an old, serious bookstore. A nude print hangs at the end of one of the library shelf- like bookcases, which are packed, row after row, with books. An unseen Elliot and Lee carry on a conversation as the camera moves down an aisle, past the rows of books. A piano playing "Bewitched" is heard. Pictures hang on the aisle ends of the shelves.

The façade of Mount Sinai Hospital. It is day. A few cars whiz by as the film moves inside, to various scenes depicting Mickey's comprehensive exam.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
First is a hearing test, and the movie cuts to a darkened hearing-test room. A light goes on, revealing a slouched- over Mickey sitting in a glass booth. He is wearing a set of headphones. The camera moves back, revealing a technician at the console on the other side of the booth. Mickey signals with his finger when he hears a sound on his headset. The jazz continues.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Next is an electronystagmography (ENG). Graph paper rolls out of a machine, and after a brief glimpse of the rolling paper, the camera moves over to show Mickey lying terrified, without his glasses, on a couch, with electrodes stuck all over his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The film then cuts to a BSER test room, where Mickey, sitting in a corner chair, wears another set of headphones. An electrode is attached to his forehead; a nearby technician sits at a computer video screen, looking at a monitoring graph. Last but not least is the tomography. Over the shoulders of a technician in a booth, a large window displays a huge, white rotating machine. It makes a whooshing noise as it turns. The camera moves down the giant cranelike device to reveal Mickey, once again lying down, this time on a table, his eyes closed, underneath it.

INT. MICKEY'S APARTMENT/BEDROOM LOFT - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
The dark bedroom is abruptly lit as Mickey, lying in his bed, wakes up with a start and turns on his night-table lamp.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm dying! I'm dying! I know it! There's a spot on my lungs!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(sitting up, putting on his glasses)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right now, take it easy, will you? It's not on your lungs. It's on your ear. No, it's the same thing, isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pulling the sheets
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	off and sitting on
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
the edge of his bed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, jeez, I can't sleep! Oh, God, there's a tumor in my head the size of a basketball!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(putting on his slippers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	N-now I keep thinking I can feel it every time I blink! Oh, Jesus! He-he-he wants me to do a brain scan to confirm what he already suspects.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey, still ruminating, stands up. Fixing his pants, he walks out of his bedroom loft into a dark upper hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (running his hand along a banister)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look...I'll make a deal with God. Let it just be my ear, okay? I'll go deaf. I'll go deaf and blind in one eye maybe. But I don't want a brain operation! Once they go into my skull, I'll-I'll wind up like the guy with the, with the wool cap who delivers for the florist!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
He walks down a spiral staircase into the dark living room.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, relax, will ya? Your whole life you run to doctors. The news is always fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pausing at the bottom of the stairs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not true. What about years ago?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
The film cuts to a flashback of Mickey's past. Dr. Smith, sitting behind his desk, faces the camera. Rows of periodicals line the wall behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_SMITH>
<DIRECTION>
(gesturing with one hand)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry to say, Mr. Sachs, that you cannot have children.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_SMITH>
<DIRECTION>
The camera moves to Dr. Smith's point of view: Hannah and Mickey, sitting on the opposite side of the desk. They look stunned.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(reacting, putting his hands across his chest)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gee.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>

<DR_SMITH>

(getting up from his desk)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, naturally, this doesn't mean that you can't have a normal sex life.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(walking over to the
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	opened office door
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
and closing it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But Mr. Sachs's tests indicate that he is infertile. Small sperm volume and infertile.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_SMITH>
<DIRECTION>
The camera moves back to the stunned Mickey and Hannah, following Dr. Smith with their eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(gesturing, looking
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	up at an offscreen Dr.
	</DIALOGUE>

Smith)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Isn't there anything I can do? Push-ups or hormones?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DR_SMITH>
<DIRECTION>
(offscreen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm afraid not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_SMITH>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I gotta get a second opinion.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
(turning to Mickey)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the second opinion.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH>
<MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(shrugging)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, then a third opinion.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
Dr. Smith walks back to his high-backed leather chair behind the desk and sits down. As he talks, the camera moves closer and closer to his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I realize this is a blow. My experience is that many very fine marriages become unstable and are destroyed by an inability to deal with this sort of problem. I hope you won't make too much of it. One can adopt children, and there are various artificial methods of fertilization.

CUT TO: EXT. GROVE STREET IN GREENWICH VILLAGE - DAY

Mickey and Hannah walk on the sidewalk, oblivious of the passing pedestrians. Hannah, crying, blows her nose.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(gesturing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm so humiliated. I don't know what to say. I mean--

	<DIALOGUE>
	Could you have ruined yourself somehow?

	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
(overlapping, looking at Mickey)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. Excessive masturbation?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, you gonna start knocking my hobbies? Jesus!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
Hannah sobs, clutching her tissue to her face.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe, maybe we can adopt a child. He said you could adopt one--
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<HANNAH>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, what about artificial insemination?

(reacting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What, by a st-stranger?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
Deep in conversation, they cross a tree-lined street. They pass a yellow wood-frame house bordered by a wrought-iron fence.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, they have these banks, you know, where they keep them frozen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH>
<MICKEY>

	Fro--? You want a-a defrosted kid? Is that your idea?

</MICKEY>
<HANNAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to experience childbirth.

</HANNAH>
<MICKEY>

	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<HANNAH>

(interrupting, sniffing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just think about it. That's all I ask.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
They walk offscreen and the film cuts to Hannah and Mickey's living room. The room is brightly lit; it's cluttered with pillows and plants. Norman and Carol, his wife, sit on the couch drinking coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<CAROL>
<DIRECTION>
(putting down her cup)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, that was a wonderful show. I think that's the best show you two ever wrote.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROL>
<NORMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(holding his cup, pointing emphatically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, the funniest show that Mickey and I ever did was the one we won the Emmy for.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey walks from the kitchen into the living room, holding a half-eaten chocolate cake on a serving plate. The sun pours through the windows he passes. Hannah is briefly seen in the background, preparing more coffee in the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah...I-I think as, I think as far as laughs, I mean just plain laughs, you know, that was probably the best thing that we ever did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey puts the cake down on the coffee table, which is already crowded with assorted plants, plates, and a bamboo tray holding utensils and napkins.
</DIRECTION>
<NORMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(agreeing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mm-hm.

</NORMAN>
<CAROL>
<DIRECTION>
(overlapping, her

	<DIALOGUE>
	hands over her
	</DIALOGUE>

crossed knees and nodding)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, it was funny, it was very funny. But the show was about the two Frenchmen, now that was funny and it was warm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROL>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey sighs and flops down on an adjoining couch. He rubs his forehead.
</DIRECTION>
<NORMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(to Carol, gesturing with his cup)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We got that idea on that trip to Paris.
	</DIALOGUE>

(to the offscreen Hannah)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you remember that summer in France? Hannah, you had jet lag for six straight weeks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROL>
<DIRECTION>
Norman chuckles.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(sighing, almost mumbling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but it was, you know, I guess we had fun when we were there and, you know, it's just, I--
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<NORMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(overlapping, nodding)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mm-hm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Hannah walks over to the group, holding a pot of coffee. She awkwardly steps past Mickey to pour coffee for Norman and Carol.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
(to Mickey)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Norman and Carol)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Coffee? Listen, you guys, we were-- You want some more?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH>
<NORMAN>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mmm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORMAN>
<HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
(refilling Norman's cup)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We-we...we had something we-we really wanted to discuss with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH>
<MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(overlapping, coughing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
Hannah refills Carol's cup. She puts the pot down on the coffee table and sits down next to Mickey.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(standing up and gesturing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jeez, this is, this is, this is very delicate and-and I only bring this up amongst friends, you know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to pace. Hannah, her hands clasped near her face, glances briefly at Carol.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(turning to the group
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	as he paces behind
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
the couch)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(grunting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	this is, uh... this should not go any further than this room.

</MICKEY>
<NORMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(sipping his coffee)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm all ears.

</NORMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Hannah sighs. Mickey pauses for a moment, collecting his thoughts.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(gesturing and pacing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hannah and I...can't have any children. Now I-I-I don't want to get into whose fault it--
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(gesturing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's my fault that we can't and- and-and the details are too embarrassing to--

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	nervously picking at

<DIRECTION>
her fingers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	W-w-we-we've decided after a lot of discussion that we-we'd try with artificial insemination.

</HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey stops his pacing and looks at the group.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(putting his hands on his hips)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I'm not so sure that I, that I like that idea myself, anyway--
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to pace behind the couch anew.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
(overlapping)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Um, I-I didn't really want to, you know, go to a sperm bank or something, have some anonymous donor.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(gesturing at Norman and Carol)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I-I just, you know, I-I-I wouldn't want that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH>
<MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(pacing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. We felt that if we were gonna do it, that we would like somebody who we knew and who we liked and who was warm and bright and...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
Norman and Carol remain silent.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you can say no... you know. Feel free to say no. W-we realize it has all kinds of implications.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey stops pacing and leans on the couch behind Norman.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but the-the point that, uh, that we're making here is that we need some sperm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey, rubbing his hands on his knees, leans back against the wall. Norman and Carol turn to each other, reacting.
</DIRECTION>
<NORMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(sighing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gee.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(chuckling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... My first reaction after the initial shock is, uh, flattered that you would ask me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(chuckling nervously)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carol glances at Norman.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing at himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, well, I would be the father.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing to Norman)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You would just have to masturbate into a little cup.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I can handle that.

	Obviously we wou-wouldn't have intercourse.

She chuckles nervously.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Gosh, listen.

He takes a sip of coffee.

	Now let's move on to another topic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
Hannah reaches for the cake as Carol and Norman exchange glances, reacting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The flashback ends. Mickey is back in the present in his darkened living room, illuminated by a glow from a window behind the couch. A coffee table sits in front of the couch. Papers are scattered on the floor. Mickey gets up from the couch where he'd been sitting. He paces back and forth as he talks over the screen.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you had my ex-partner's baby. Twins. Maybe that did cause some trouble, but

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think we were drifting apart anyhow. Now instead of man and wife we're just good friends. Boy, love is really unpredictable.

INT. METROPOLITAN OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Manon Lescaut is being performed. Onstage, the soprano in the title role sings a mournful aria as she kneels by the ruins of a wagon. The background is dark. The film moves up to the private boxes in the upper loge. David and Holly can be seen from a distance sitting in one of the boxes. David glances at her; he reaches down for a bottle of wine. The movie briefly cuts back to the stage. The soprano is leaning on a wagon wheel; her voice soars. Then it's back to a closer look at Holly and David in their box. The aria continues as David hands a smiling Holly a glass. He uncorks the wine and pours some in both their glasses. Holly mouths a thank you, glancing around. They look at each other and raise their glasses in a toast.

Dusty bought this huge house in Southampton.

The opera audience is heard cheering, applauding, and sounding their "Bravos."

The clapping stops as the movie cuts to Frederick's loft. It is day. Lee, wearing a baggy plaid shirt and jeans, has opened the door for Elliot and his client, wealthy rock star Dusty Frye.

Lee chuckles as she looks at him; he is wearing sunglasses, a red-imprinted T-shirt, and a baggy coat. She turns and walks with Frederick, Elliot, and Dusty farther into the loft, her hands clasped behind her back.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>

his chest)

	If you stare at that Stella too long, the colors just seem to float. It's kinda weird.

Frederick covers his face to hide his disgust.

As Dusty talks, the camera follows Elliot, who walks past the others to examine the drawings more closely. Two framed nude drawings of Lee are propped up on an easel. Elliot glances admiringly at the drawings, then surreptitiously at Lee, admiring her body as she converses with an offscreen Dusty and Frederick.

<LEE>

(looking at an offscreen Frederick, gesturing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Big. Frederick, show him the oils.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<FREDERICK>
<DIRECTION>
(offscreen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're in the basement.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDERICK>
<DIRECTION>
The camera leaves Elliot to follow the enthusiastic Lee as she takes Dusty by the arm and starts leading him to the door. Frederick follows at a distance.
</DIRECTION>
<LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Dusty)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frederick's done this whole new series that I'm sure you would really love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<DUSTY>
<DIRECTION>
(overlapping, muttering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, are...are they big?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUSTY>
<LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Some of them...yeah, some of them are very big.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<DUSTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Cause I got a lot of wall space there.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(chuckling)
</DIRECTION>
<FREDERICK>
<DIRECTION>
(angrily stopping in his tracks)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't sell my work by the yard!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDERICK>
<LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(chuckling, reacting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Frederick!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<DIRECTION>
The camera now moves back to Elliot, still staring at the nude drawings, as the sounds of Frederick's and Dusty's footsteps are heard leaving the loft. He turns and hesitantly smiles to an offscreen Lee.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(chuckling softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's everything?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(walking onscreen towards Elliot)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, you know...I talked to Hannah this morning on the phone, and she said that you two might be going to the country for the weekend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<ELLIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, she loves to go out in the woods.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(nodding, her arms clasped around her chest)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(chuckling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I go nuts. It's a conflict.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
He laughs. Lee, uneasy, looks down.
</DIRECTION>
<LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to get my teeth cleaned this week.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<ELLIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, that's nice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
There's an awkward moment of silence.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(breaking the silence,
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	pointing in the
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
direction of the door)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I figured I'd get, uh, Frederick and Dusty together.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(looking in the same direction, gesturing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yeah, that's really nice of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<ELLIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. This kid, he's earned a trillion dollars.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(nodding, wrapping
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	her arms around her

<DIRECTION>
chest again)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<ELLIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's got like six gold records.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(gesturing, relieved
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	that she's found
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
something to say)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, speaking of records...I bought that Mozart Trio you recommended...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<DIRECTION>
The camera follows Lee as she walks quickly to the stereo unit, pulling a record off the shelf.
</DIRECTION>
<LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and the man in the record shop showed me another one that I think you'd love. It's a... another Bach, second movement.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls the record out of its jacket and puts it on the turntable.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(offscreen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, you-you have that one?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(working at the
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	stereo, turning her
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
head towards Elliot)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(offscreen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I would love to hear it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
Bach's Concerto for Harpsichord fills the room.
</DIRECTION>
<LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(putting the turntable cover in place)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, and Holly met a wonderful man who loves opera. An architect.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(offscreen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, that's nice. I'd love to see her wind up settled. She's a tense one.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(chuckling)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The record in place, Lee turns and leans back against the stereo unit. She listens to the music, her eyes closed. The record plays for a few moments in the quiet room, as Elliot walks over to Lee and leans against the shelf near her.
</DIRECTION>
<LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(intently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Isn't that beautiful?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(looking at Lee, his
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	hands clasped in
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
front of him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know this. Bach. F Minor Concerto. It's one of my favorites.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
Lee, smiling, continues to listen to the music, her head down; Elliot stares at her.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(after a pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh...did you ever get around to e.e. cummings?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(wrapping her arms
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	around her chest and looking away from
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Elliot for a moment)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, he's just adorable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<DIRECTION>
Elliot nods.
</DIRECTION>
<LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(awkwardly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They have a very large gay clientele, you know, where I get my teeth cleaned, and...all the hygienists now wear gloves because they're afraid of AIDS.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(taking a breath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
There is another moment of silence. Elliot stares at Lee, who continues to look down, her arms around her chest. The harpsichord plays on.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you ever get around to the poem on page a hundred and twelve?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, it made me cry
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(tentatively looking at Elliot)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	it was so beautiful...so romantic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<DIRECTION>
Lee looks down again; the music plays softly and Elliot continues to stare at her, thinking.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want so badly to kiss her. Not here, you idiot. You've got to get her alone someplace.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
As Elliot's thoughts are heard over the scene, Lee glances around the loft, then begins to walk away. The camera follows her as she goes past the nude drawings, which become the focus of attention as Lee walks offscreen.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I've got to proceed cautiously. This is a very delicate situation. Okay, uh...ask her if you can see her for lunch or a drink tomorrow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
Lee walks back onscreen, to the bookshelf behind the drawings. She takes the e.e. cummings book from the shelf and flips through it as she walks back to Elliot, who is still leaning by the stereo, still ruminating.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And be ready to make light of the offer if she's unresponsive. This has to be done very skillfully, very diplomatically.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(showing Elliot a poem in her book)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you ever read this one--?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<DIRECTION>
Elliot leaps up, grabs Lee, and kisses her passionately. Lee, surprised, pushes him away.
</DIRECTION>
<LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Elliot! Don't!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<ELLIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lee! Lee! Lee, I'm in love with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
He kisses Lee again. He clumsily turns around; she humps against the stereo unit. As Lee pulls away, she smashes into the turntable. The needle scratches loudly. Lee, shocked, is gasping. The record, pushed to a different part of the concerto, now plays a more complicated, faster fugue.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(breathing hard)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(gasping)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(frantically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I...I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm sorry. I have to talk to you for... There's so much that I want to tell you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
Lee stares at Elliot in shock.
</DIRECTION>
<LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(still gasping)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Elliot!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(gesturing desperately)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have been in love with you for so long.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
Frederick and Dusty's indistinct voices, raised in argument, are suddenly heard. Elliot quickly turns away from Lee. She tries to compose herself and the film cuts to the loft entranceway. Frederick enters the loft first, followed by a confused Dusty. They stride across the loft past Lee, who is standing by the stereo. Elliot, standing near the nude drawings, is looking through a book.
</DIRECTION>
<FREDERICK>
<DIRECTION>
(angrily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please forget it! I don't have any interest in selling anything!

</FREDERICK>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I ask you if you have something with a little puce in it, you gotta fly off the handle!

</DUSTY>
<LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(in a slightly higher-pitched voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the problem?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<FREDERICK>
<DIRECTION>
(pulling the nude
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	drawings off his
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
easel angrily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not interested in what your interior decorator would think, okay?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDERICK>
<DUSTY>
<DIRECTION>
(overlapping, gesturing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I can't commit to anything without consulting her first. That's what I have her for, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUSTY>
<FREDERICK>
<DIRECTION>
(carrying the drawings off)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is degrading! You don't buy paintings to blend in with the sofa!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDERICK>
<DUSTY>
<DIRECTION>
(looking after Frederick)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not a sofa, it's an ottoman!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(touching his forehead, turning to Elliot)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God, forget it! Let's just get outta here, Elliot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUSTY>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(putting down the book)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
The film moves outside the loft building. Dusty and Elliot emerge and walk to Dusty's waiting limousine. Elliot is rubbing his forehead, anguished.
</DIRECTION>
<DUSTY>
<DIRECTION>
(angrily, getting into the car)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What a weirdo that guy is! Paranoid.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(noticing Elliot's anguished face)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the matter with you?

</ELLIOT>
<DUSTY>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not that big a deal. We just didn't hit it off.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, look, you-you-you go on ahead.

<DUSTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you okay? You look-- You're sweatin'.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(overlapping, nervously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Yeah, I just-just need so- some-some fresh air. It's probably something I ate. I'll-I'll walk. You go ahead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUSTY>
<DIRECTION>
Dusty settles down in the backseat and closes the door. Elliot leans down to the chauffeur's window, signaling for him to start driving.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing, gesturing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You go. Go on. Go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
The limousine drives off. Elliot runs to a phone booth across the street. He picks up the phone and dials.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The film cuts to Frederick in his loft, standing near the phone. It rings. Frederick picks it up.
</DIRECTION>
<FREDERICK>
<DIRECTION>
(into the telephone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello? Hello? Hello?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDERICK>
<DIRECTION>
When no one answers, Frederick, reacting, hangs up, and the film moves back outside to the phone booth, where Elliot, the phone receiver to his ear, listens for a moment, then hangs up. He walks out of the booth, reacting, then walks down the sidewalk, where he bumps into a frantic Lee, just turning the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(gesturing in relief)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh! There you are!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<DIRECTION>
Elliot mumbles, relieved and confused.
</DIRECTION>
<LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was looking for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(gesturing)

</ELLIOT>
<LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(gesturing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, how do you expect me to react to such a thing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<DIRECTION>
Elliot, uneasy, glances up in the direction of Frederick's loft. He leads Lee a few yards up the street, away from any prying eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(taking Lee's arm)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wh--, uh, I know, I know but, I am in love with you.

</LEE>
<DIRECTION>
She sighs.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I know! I-I-I-I, I realize.

</LEE>
<ELLIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wh--, it-it-it-it, it's so sad. She's crazy about me, but somewhere on the, along the line, I've fallen out of love with her.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Not because of me, I hope.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes! But I...I have certain feelings for you, but don't make me say anything more, all right?

Lee looks at him.

<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>

	O-o-o-okay, Lee. Okay, okay. You, you, y-you've said enough. It's my responsibility now. I will work things out.

	Oh, Elliot, please! I can't be a party to this! I'm suddenly wracked with guilt just standing her talking to you on the street!

</LEE>
<DIRECTION>
She sighs.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(emphatically)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Your guilt is because you feel the same.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, please, I have to go. I have to get my teeth cleaned.

She walks off. Elliot stares after her, grinning.

EXT. STREET CORNER OUTSIDE EVAN AND NORMA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A taxi turns a West Side street corner and stops in front of Evan and Norma's building, which is decorated with a long metal awning. It's an overcast day.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A station wagon on the opposite side of the street pulls away as Hannah, a white scarf fluttering over her shoulder, gets out of the cab. She runs into the building; the taxi drives away. A piano plays "Bewitched" over the screen.

Hannah takes off her shoulder bag and her coat as her aggravated father walks past her towards the kitchen. He passes a wall with an ornate mirror and some framed photographs.

Through a doorway, Norma can be seen sitting on a chair in the kitchen. She wears a robe over a slip and stockings; she's drinking. Evan stands in the doorway looking at her; he doesn't go in.

Norma reacts, turning to her daughter. Hannah, however, has her back turned. She is busy taking charge in the kitchen as Evan speaks. She takes some pills out of a cupboard and hands them to her mother with a glass of water.

The camera moves to Evan, who continues to tell his story, ignoring his wife's outburst, as he walks away from the kitchen doorway into the den.

Evan is back in the doorway, listening to Norma, getting more and more angry. As he makes a retort, he starts to walk back to the den and his piano.

</HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
Norma sips her coffee, softly sobbing. Hannah, reacting, walks away from the counter and, capping the bottle of pills, puts them back in the cupboard. Evan plays the piano offscreen. The camera moves in on Hannah's face as she reflects, her voice heard over the screen.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She was so beautiful at one time, and he was so dashing. Both of them just full of promise and hopes that never materialized.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
The camera leaves Hannah's face as she continues to reflect; it moves to the den, to the row of family photos on the piano: one of a present-day Evan and Norma, others where both Norma and Evan are young, beautiful, hopeful. The music plays on.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the fights and the constant infidelities to prove themselves...and blaming each other. It's s-sad. They loved the idea of having us kids, but raising us didn't interest them much. But it's impossible to hold it against them. They didn't know anything else.

The film cuts back to the kitchen. Norma stands up; Hannah takes her coffee cup and sets it on the counter.

Evan plays a few bars of "You Are Too Beautiful" as mother and daughter, their backs to the camera, listen. Norma leans over the piano; Hannah looks off into the distance, deep in reflection. The piano music continues in the background as the movie cuts to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lee walking along a wharf by the waterfront. The wind blows her hair; she hugs the e.e. cummings book to her chest. She, too, is deep in thought. She stops at the edge of the wharf; the camera continues to move, to a group of wooden pilings nearby, lapped by the water.

INT. HOSPITAL CAT-SCAN ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The quiet continues as the film cuts to a close-up of a large, circular CAT-scan module in an antiseptic hospital room. A slowly moving stretcher, bearing Mickey's strapped prone body, begins to enter the round opening of the module. As the camera pulls back from Mickey, his taped head under the scan, two technicians can be seen through the window separating the scanner from the control room. One of them, sitting down, taps information into a computer while the other technician stands nearby, looking from Mickey to the computer screen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The movie then cuts briefly to the computer screen, showing an image of Mickey's skull. Scan lines bleep over the skull. The camera moves up from the screen to reveal Mickey once again, as seen through the window, silent and serious under the CAT-scan module.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From Mickey's prone form, the film moves to the two technicians, as seen through the window in the scanner room. They examine the computer screen and talk indistinctly to each other. One of the men, nodding, taps more information into the computer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
While they're studying the CAT-scan picture, the camera cuts to a back view of Mickey under the module. There is a science-fiction feel to this scene, as if Mickey is lying in the center of a huge, white, futuristic circle. The stretcher, bearing Mickey, slowly moves out of the module.

As Mickey finishes his speech, the "real" Dr. Brooks is seen walking into the office. The previous scene had been a figment of Mickey's imagination, a nightmare fantasy only. Holding Mickey's X-rays, the "real" Dr. Brooks walks past the same row of books to the light panel.

	Well, you're just fine. There's absolutely nothing here at all. And your tests are all fine.

Once again, Mickey is seen leaving the building, but this time he bounds down the steps, jumping for joy. He runs swirling down the street, clapping his hands, happy with relief.

As the harpsichord continues to play, the film moves inside, to one of the hotel rooms. Elliot, his back to the camera, is opening the door to Lee.

Elliot closes the door behind her as she enters. They stand very close to each other, framed by the door and a stark, subtly striped wallpapered wall.

They kiss, their figures almost silhouetted in the warm glow of the room. Elliot takes Lee's coat off without breaking the kiss. They embrace. They kiss each other lightly, then stronger, more passionately, their embrace much tighter.
</DIRECTION>

And it's later that night. The harpsichord music begins to play again as the camera moves over the bed covers to reveal Lee, lying contentedly under the sheets, her hair fanned out on the pillows, one arm near her head.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, all the time.

</LEE>
<DIRECTION>
Elliot chuckles; they hold hands.
</DIRECTION>
<LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know she must be a really passionate person.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(looking at their clasped hands)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, she's, she's very warm, but, but it-it's me that wants to be giving to you. I-I-I want to do things for you. Hannah doesn't need me as much.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(chuckling as Lee laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm being presumptuous. Not that you need me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<LEE>

(nodding)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want you to take care of me... And I love when you do things to me.

Elliot leans down to Lee; they begin to kiss passionately.

EXT. STREET OUTSIDE FREDERICK'S LOFT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lee walks along the sidewalk in the rain; she's bareheaded. The streets are dark. A car drives by; a pedestrian passes holding an umbrella. Lee passes a restaurant well lit inside by hanging lamps. The baroque music continues as she enters the loft, her head soaked. She closes the door, touching her soaking hair.
</DIRECTION>
<FREDERICK>
<DIRECTION>
(offscreen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're late.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDERICK>
<DIRECTION>
Lee walks through the loft's living room area, unbelting her coat, towards the bathroom. She passes Frederick, who sits at a table in the kitchen area, drinking a cup of coffee and reading the paper. A plate with a half-eaten sandwich sits in front of him. The music stops.
</DIRECTION>
<LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(opening the bathroom door)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lucy and I kept talking, and I didn't realize how late it had gotten.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<FREDERICK>
<DIRECTION>
(barely glancing up from his paper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You missed a very dull TV show about Auschwitz. More gruesome film clips...and more puzzled intellectuals declaring their mystification over the systematic murder of millions.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDERICK>
<DIRECTION>
As he talks, Lee is seen turning on the bathroom light. She takes off her coat, hanging it on a hook, then begins to dry her hair with a towel.
</DIRECTION>
<FREDERICK>
<DIRECTION>
(turning his head
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	slightly in Lee's
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
direction and gesturing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The reason why they could never answer the question "How could it possibly happen?" is that it's the wrong question. Given what people are, the question is
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(swallowing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Why doesn't it happen more often?" Of course it does, in subtler forms.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDERICK>
<DIRECTION>
Frederick takes a bite of his sandwich and another sip of coffee as Lee walks out of the bathroom, tossing the towel down on the counter.
</DIRECTION>
<LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(moving her fingers through her wet hair)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have a little headache from this weather.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<DIRECTION>
She takes a kettle and fills it with water.
</DIRECTION>
<FREDERICK>
<DIRECTION>
(grunting, sipping his coffee)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's been ages since I sat in front of the TV... just changing channels to find something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDERICK>
<DIRECTION>
As Frederick continues his monologue, Lee is busy in the background: striking a wooden match and lighting a burner on the stove for the kettle, taking a glass out of the cupboard, walking into the bathroom for some pills, filling the glass with water in the kitchen sink, and taking her pills.
</DIRECTION>
<FREDERICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see the whole culture...Nazis, deodorant salesman, wrestlers...beauty contests, the talk show... Can you imagine the level of a mind that watches wrestling?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(gesturing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hmm? But the worst are the fundamentalist preachers...third- rate con men, telling the poor suckers that watch them that they speak for Jesus...and to please send in money.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(picking up his sandwich)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Money, money, money! If Jesus came back, and saw what's going on in his name, he'd never stop throwing up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDERICK>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a bite of his sandwich and a sip of coffee. Lee sets her glass on the kitchen counter and walks towards the bedroom area.
</DIRECTION>
<LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(impatiently, her hands in her hair)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, God, Frederick, could you please lighten up?! I'm really not in the mood to hear a review of contemporary society again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<DIRECTION>
She starts to take off her wet clothes by the bed. Frederick takes off his glasses. He turns and looks at Lee in surprise.
</DIRECTION>
<FREDERICK>
<DIRECTION>
(standing up from the table)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, you've been very nervous lately.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDERICK>
<LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(sighing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't take this anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<FREDERICK>
<DIRECTION>
(walking over to the bed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm just trying to complete an education I started on you five years ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDERICK>
<LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(unbuttoning her blouse)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not your pupil.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(sighing, her hands at her side)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was, but I'm not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<FREDERICK>
<DIRECTION>
(sitting down on the edge of the bed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When you leave the nest, I just want you to be ready to face the real world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDERICK>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls Lee down next to him on the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(putting her hand on Frederick's leg)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frederick, we're going to have to make some changes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<DIRECTION>
She sighs.
</DIRECTION>
<FREDERICK>
<DIRECTION>
(quickly looking at Lee, alarmed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDERICK>
<LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, you know what. I'm suffocating!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<FREDERICK>
<DIRECTION>
(turning away, his
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	hands clasped in
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
front of him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh! Are we going to have this conversation again?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDERICK>
<LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, we're going to have this conversation again. I...I have to leave. I have to move out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<FREDERICK>
<DIRECTION>
(shaking his clasped hands intensely)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDERICK>
<LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(sighing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I have to!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<FREDERICK>
<DIRECTION>
(emotionally)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you going to use for money?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDERICK>
<LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. I thought, maybe I'd move in with my parents for a while.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<FREDERICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tch, oh. I always told you you would leave me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looking at Lee)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But...does it have to be now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDERICK>
<LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(hugging her arm with her other hand)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, maybe it'll only be temporary, but I ha--I have to try.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<FREDERICK>
<DIRECTION>
(taking Lee's head in
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	his hands and looking
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
at her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh...Lee, you are my whole world.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pausing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good God! Have you been kissed tonight?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDERICK>
<LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(reacting, pushing
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frederick's hands
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
from her face)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<FREDERICK>
<DIRECTION>
(reacting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yes, you have!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDERICK>
<LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(quickly standing up, defensively)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<FREDERICK>
<DIRECTION>
(raising his voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've been with someone!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDERICK>
<LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(overlapping, running away from the bed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop accusing me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<DIRECTION>
Lee runs into the kitchen, her hands tight around her chest.
</DIRECTION>
<FREDERICK>
<DIRECTION>
(offscreen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm too smart, Lee! You can't fool me! You're turning all red!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDERICK>
<DIRECTION>
Lee, fraught with emotion, briefly puts her outstretched hands on the refrigerator door, then turns around and leans against it, hugging herself, her blouse still unbuttoned, her hair still wet and bedraggled.
</DIRECTION>
<LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leave me alone!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<DIRECTION>
Frederick enters the kitchen area and leans against the counter.
</DIRECTION>
<FREDERICK>
<DIRECTION>
(angrily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Christ! What's wrong with you?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDERICK>
<LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(leaning against the refrigerator, sighing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<FREDERICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, couldn't you say something? You have to slither around behind my back!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDERICK>
<LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(overlapping, her voice emotionally raised)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm saying it now!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<FREDERICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you met somebody else?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDERICK>
<LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(sighing, nodding)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<DIRECTION>
Frederick cringes, reacting. He puts his hand to his forehead; he sighs.
</DIRECTION>
<LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(walking into the bathroom)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you, God, you knew that was going to happen sooner or later. I can't live like this!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<FREDERICK>
<DIRECTION>
(turning to face Lee
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	in the bathroom, his
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
arms crossed)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Who is it?

</FREDERICK>
<LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(frantically putting
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	things in her purse,
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
glaring at Frederick)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the difference?! It's just somebody I met!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<FREDERICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But who? Where did you meet him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDERICK>
<LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It doesn't make a difference! I have to move out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<FREDERICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are, you are my only connection to the world!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDERICK>
<DIRECTION>
Lee turns and faces Frederick in the bathroom doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(gesturing emotionally)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, God, that's too much responsibility for me. It's not fair! I want a less complicated life, Frederick. I want a husband, maybe even a child before it's too late.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<FREDERICK>
<DIRECTION>
(reacting, his face in his hand)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus...Jesus!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDERICK>
<LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(gesturing, moving closer to Frederick)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, God, I don't even know what I want.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<FREDERICK>
<DIRECTION>
(sighing heavily, reacting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDERICK>
<LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(rubbing Frederick's shoulder tenderly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tch, oh, what do you get out of me, anyway? I mean...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(laying her head
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	against his shoulder,
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
sighing deeply)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	it's not sexual anymore. It's certainly not intellectual. I mean, you're so superior to me in every way that--
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<DIRECTION>
Frederick furiously shakes Lee away. He pounds his fist against a cupboard. Lee, gasping, moves away.
</DIRECTION>
<FREDERICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, don't patronize me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDERICK>
<DIRECTION>
He puts his hand on his forehead, then turns to the offscreen Lee.
</DIRECTION>
<FREDERICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God! I should have married you years ago when you wanted to! I should have agreed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDERICK>
<DIRECTION>
He walks over to Lee in another area of the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(sighing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, God, don't you know it never would have worked?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<DIRECTION>
Frederick turns away from Lee. He begins to pace near the counter.
</DIRECTION>
<FREDERICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you, one day you would leave me...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(leaning on the counter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	for a younger man. I--

He loudly pounds his fist on the counter in despair and frustration, then covers his eyes with his hands in sorrow.

INT. HANNAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hannah, wearing a plaid shirt, sits up in bed, a book propped up on her knees. A cupboard with some bric-a-brac is mounted behind the night table, which holds a small, white, warm-glowing lamp and some photographs. She turns the page as Elliot, in pajamas and silk bathrobe, enters. She continues to read her book as he sits down at the edge of the bed and muses. His voice is heard over the screen.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What passion today with Lee. She's a volcano. It was a totally fulfilling experience... Just as I dreamed it would be.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(nodding slightly as he takes off his slippers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what it was. It was like living out a dream...a great dream.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(taking off his bathrobe)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now I feel very good and cozy being here next to Hannah. There's something very lovely and real about Hannah.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(tossing his bathrobe
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	aside and lying down on the bed next to Hannah, his hands
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
crossed over his stomach)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She gives me a very deep feeling of being part of something. She's a wonderful woman...and I betrayed her. She came into my empty life and changed it...and I paid her back by banging her sister in a hotel room. God, I'm despicable. What a cruel and shallow thing to do.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(sitting up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to call her now and tell her what we did was crazy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(anxiously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It can't ever happen again. I'm not that kind of man...and I value Hannah too much. I love my wife. Now I've betrayed her. Oh, God!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
Elliot frantically stands up and leaves the room.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNAH>

(reading, not looking up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where're you going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(offscreen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've, uh...gotta find, gotta get a phone number in my desk. I forgot to phone Mel Kaufman.

(still reading)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's so late.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(offscreen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I know. I-I can't believe I forgot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
Elliot walks quickly into the darkened hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(muttering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if he answers?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turning into the
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	doorway leading to
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
the living room)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll hang up.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(walking into the darkened living room)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll tell her we can't communicate until I terminate my marriage.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's immoral.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
Elliot switches on the light. He paces back and forth in front of the piano and an accompanying music stand. The top of the piano is filled with family photos; the lamp he turned on illuminates some framed pictures on the wall and the piece of sheet music open on the piano.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(gesturing and whispering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then, time will pass. I won't call, and she'll get the idea. I gotta stop this before I get in too deep. I'd rather hurt Lee a little, than destroy Hannah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
Elliot stops pacing and checks his wristwatch.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering, rubbing his hands)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's one-thirty. She...she can't have a conversation with me...with him around. I'm getting hysterical.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(putting his hands on his hips)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll call her first thing in the morning. I'll call her at six.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frederick goes jogging at six, yeah, she'll be alone. And I'll, I'll call her and nip it in the bud.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
The phone rings. Elliot jumps.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(loudly, to the offscreen Hannah, gasping)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got it! I've got it! I've got it!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(picking up the phone, into the telephone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(loudly, for the offscreen Hannah's benefit)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mel!

</ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
The movie cuts to Lee, standing in the dark in Frederick's loft. She talks softly into the telephone.
</DIRECTION>
<LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(into the telephone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would have hung up if you hadn't answered and I promise I won't ever do this again, but I just had to tell you, I feel very close to you tonight. Very, very close.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pausing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good night.

Lee hangs up the phone and the movie cuts back to Elliot, standing in his living room. Stunned, he slowly lowers the phone receiver.

"The only absolute knowledge attainable by man is that life is meaningless." - Tolstoy
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jazz is heard as the movie cuts to the outside of a university library, the camera focused on a huge replica of Rodin's Thinker before moving to the front entrance. Mickey can be seen emerging from its depths. He wears his raincoat, his hands are in his pockets. He ponders the scene as he walks past the statue and a small front garden and down the sidewalk. Passersby, some holding books, are seen.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Millions of books written on every conceivable subject by all these great minds, and, and in the end, none of 'em knows anything more about the big questions of life than I do. Ss--I read Socrates. You know, n-n-n--, this guy used to kn-knock off little Greek boys. What the hell's he got to teach me? And, and Nietzsche with his, with his Theory of Eternal Recurrence. He said that the life we live, we're gonna live over and over again the exact same way for eternity. Great. That means I, uh, I'll have to sit through the Ice Capades again. Tch. It's not worth it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
The movie next cuts to a sunny day in Central Park. A male jogger, seen through some tree branches, runs by. The camera moves past him, revealing a pondering Mickey walking by the reservoir. He continues to talk over the screen.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And, and Freud, another great pessimist. Jeez, I was in analysis for years. Nothing happened. My poor analyst got so frustrated. The guy finally put in a salad bar.

Several joggers pass Mickey; he continues to ruminate.

sweatsuit who runs by)

	...Oh! Look at this one! Poor thing. My God, she has to tote all that fat around. Maybe the poets are right. Maybe love is the only answer.

Mickey goes over to the chain-link fence encircling the reservoir. He stops walking and looks out over the water.

	Shh--Of course, I was in love with Hannah. That didn't work out too well.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I even took her sister out. Remember that?

Mickey continues to look through the fence at the water and the distant skyline. A jogger crosses in front of him. It's very quiet; the soft jazz continues.

	Remember years ago when Hannah and I got divorced and she fixed me up with her sister Holly?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
The film cuts abruptly to Mickey's flashback of his date with Holly, beginning with a rock club performance. The soft jazz becomes loud, pulsating rock. Three punkers--a girl with pink hair, a girl with a spiked mohawk, and a guy with Stevie Wonder braids and sunglasses--watch and bop their heads to the sounds of the offscreen rock band, The 39 Steps.

The camera moves to the stage, revealing a sleazy-looking rock band in the midst of their number.

As the band loudly plays on, the camera moves across the spellbound audience, sitting at crowded, smoky, small tables, to reveal a stricken Mickey and a mesmerized Holly squeezed together at one of them. A nearby member of the audience swills beer from a bottle. Holly, beating time to the music and enjoying herself, takes a puff of her cigarette. She wears a wristful of silver bracelets. She glances at Mickey impatiently. He's the only one in the place wearing a suit.

Holly turns back to the band, who are still in full swing. The camera moves down the body of the lead singer, singing into a microphone, from his longish, curly red hair, through his cut-off red shirt and sweaty torso, to his guitar. He wears several silver bracelets on his wrists and gold bracelets on his upper arm. The microphone screeches feedback.

The camera moves back to Holly and the even more stricken- looking Mickey. They are crowded in with people. In the background, a waitress holds up a tray. A man drinks from a glass mug; people chatter indistinctly over the loud band. The club is noisy, smoky, and thick with people. Holly glances at Mickey once again, this time unable to contain her annoyance.

...as the camera leaves the musicians and moves to the conversatively dressed audience. A far cry from the rock club atmosphere, the Carlyle is quiet except for Bobby Short's singing. The audience at their tables watch him, some with smiles of pleasure. A man has his arm around a woman. Jewels sparkle in another woman's hair. The men wear suits.

Mickey and Holly sit at one of the tables; a candle burns in its holder on the tabletop. Holly takes a cigarette from her purse as she holds her hand to her nose, sniffing. Mickey keeps shooting glances at Holly; she can't sit still. Bobby Short continues to sing...

A big-band rendition of "You Made Me Love You" begins as the film cuts to a hotel room. Elliot and Lee can be seen dancing cheek to cheek in the reflection of a mirror over a dresser. A TV sits in the corner. A lamp is on one side of the dresser; on the other side is a bucket with champagne. Two half-full glasses sit nearby. Elliot and Lee dance into view. Without missing a beat, Elliot picks up one of the glasses of champagne and hands it to Lee. She sips. Elliot sips, then puts it back down on the dresser. They embrace tightly, continuing to dance.

Elliot, Hannah, and the twins sit at the dining room table. A Christmas tree stands in the corner of the room, next to a table holding a lamp; a picture hangs on the wall. The family has just finished eating; the table is cluttered with the remains of dinner, including a quart of milk, some chocolate syrup, and a bottle of ketchup. Hannah's two adopted children stand by her chair; she is showing them how a small camera works. The children watch her, fascinated, muttering among themselves. Elliot looks listless.

Hannah and Holly reach the top of the stairs. They walk onto a cavernous, high-tech floor. Empty bleachers line one wall; the rest of the floor is filled with racks of clothes and empty space.

<HOLLY>

	Did you ever think you'd be helping me buy something to wear to the opera?

	...and his wife's, uh, in and out of institutions. She's schizophrenic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
Holly continues to talk as she follows Hannah across the floor to a rack of dresses. Hannah's on one side, flipping through the hangers. Holly, on the other side of the same rack, talks to her sister, not looking at the clothes.

<HOLLY>

Hannah takes a jacket on a hanger off the rack and looks at it. She holds it to her.

<HANNAH>

(finally looking back and forth along the rack)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now...what should I wear to my audition?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>

Hannah turns to Holly with surprise. She puts the jacket back on the rack and stares at her; she inhales.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLY>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got a singing audition for a Broadway musical.

Hannah begins to look at the rack of clothes on Holly's side, while her sister stares at her, frowning.

<HOLLY>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you think everybody in m- musicals sings so well?

Holly is silent for a moment. Hannah takes a blouse off the rack and looks at it.

The two sisters walk away from the rack, Hannah slightly in the lead. Behind them are some more racks of clothing and a large window with closed venetian blinds.

Holly pauses, looking at her sister. They continue to walk.

</HOLLY>

A female customer, who'd come over to the table, browsing through the rack of clothes near Hannah, looks up, reacting. She walks away.

She walks past Holly and briefly looks at a different rack of clothes beneath the table.

	<DIALOGUE>

Holly chuckles and begins to look through the scarves on the table.

CUT TO:

<DIRECTION>
INT. THEATER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A group of theater executives, including the producer, the director, and two assistants, sit in a cluster in the empty audience, talking; they look up at the offscreen Holly, who is auditioning on the stage. She is singing "I'm Old- Fashioned," accompanied by a piano.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(offscreen, singing softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"This year's fancies Are passing fancies..."
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
The film moves from the audience to the stage where Holly, her hands clasped in front of her, continues to sing her song. A large group of other hopefuls are seen in the background behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing her
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	singing, barely
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
moving her body)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"But sighing sighs Holding hands This my heart Understands I'm old-fashioned And I don't mind it It's how I want to be As long as you agree To stay old-fashioned with me."
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
The camera moves from Holly back to the executives in the audience. As it passes the empty audience seats, they are heard offscreen.

	April Knox?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAGE_MANAGER>
<DIRECTION>
The film cuts back to the stage, where April, handling the audition pianist some sheet music, prepares herself to sing "The Way You Look Tonight." The stage is very black, stark, except for April and the pianist.
</DIRECTION>
<APRIL>
<DIRECTION>

EXT. A STREET OUTSIDE THE THEATER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A theater marquee can be seen on the busy street as Holly and April walk down the street towards the camera, moving closer and closer as they talk. Workmen and various street noises can be heard indistinctly in the background.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm telling you, you sounded great. You, uh, you may be surprised.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<APRIL>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I'm just glad we have a catering job this week. I'm real low on money.

	<DIALOGUE>
	And you, you-you're going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I-I-I didn't know what to say. First I said no, but then, he pressed it. He said, uh, he'd taken you once and he really wanted to invite me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(pausing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I'm seeing him.

</HOLLY>
<APRIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, it's just an evening at the opera. Did I, I-I do wrong in accepting?

Holly looks away sadly; she shakes her head.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</APRIL>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The big leap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The film cuts to Father Flynn's rectory office. The Catholic priest looks out a simple stained-glass window, then turns to an offscreen Mickey.
</DIRECTION>
<FATHER_FLYNN>
<DIRECTION>
(gesturing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now why do you think that you would like to convert to Catholicism?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER_FLYNN>
<DIRECTION>
The camera moves back to reveal Mickey, his back to the camera, sitting in front of Father Flynn's desk. A lamp is lit in the background; the Father's desk is neat. The room is comfortably decorated in wood and leather.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, uh, because, y-you know, I gotta have something to believe in, otherwise life is just meaningless.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<FATHER_FLYNN>
<DIRECTION>
(pacing behind his desk and gesturing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I understand. But why did you make the decision to choose the Catholic faith?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER_FLYNN>
<DIRECTION>
The movie cuts to Mickey's face. He's very neat in a tie, sweater, and sports jacket.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(gesturing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tch. Well, y-you know...first of all, because it's a very beautiful religion. It's very well structured. Now I'm talking now, incidentally, about the-the, uh, against-school- prayer, pro-abortion, anti-nuclear wing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<FATHER_FLYNN>
<DIRECTION>
(offscreen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So at the moment you don't believe in God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER_FLYNN>
<DIRECTION>
The camera cuts back to Father Flynn, who walks over to a leather armchair next to a table set for tea. He begins to pour the tea into china cups.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(offscreen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. A-a-and I-I want to. You know, I'm-I'm willing to do anything. I'll, you know, I'll dye Easter eggs if it works.
	</DIALOGUE>

(walking over to
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Father Flynn and sitting down in an
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
adjacent chair)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I-I need some evidence. I gotta have some proof. Uh, you know, i- i-if I can't believe in God
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(gesturing, his raincoat in his lap)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	then I don't think life is worth living.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<FATHER_FLYNN>
<DIRECTION>
(stopping his tea pouring)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It means making a very big leap.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER_FLYNN>
<DIRECTION>
Father Flynn clasps his hands in his lap.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(nodding, fiddling with his raincoat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, well, can-can you help me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
The film abruptly cuts to the long hallway in Mickey's parents' apartment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the foreground, a section of the living room can be seen, with a bureau holding a lamp and a framed photo. The hallway itself is crowded with pictures and a wall shelf. At the other end of the hallway, in the background, is another bureau, with candlesticks on top and a framed picture on the wall above. Mickey's mother stands in the front of this bureau at the hallway's end, screaming at the top of her lungs, holding her heart dramatically.
</DIRECTION>
<MOTHER>
<DIRECTION>
(crying)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why? Oh, my God!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTHER>
<DIRECTION>
She sobs hysterically, staggering offscreen to the bathroom; she shuts the door. Mickey walks into view, in the living room, looking after his shocked mother, who continues to cry over the scene.

His father walks into view, carrying a teacup and a candy dish. He strides past Mickey towards the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(following his father)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, because I never thought of God in my life. Now I'm giving it serious thought.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<FATHER>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>

<MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(gesturing at the
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	kitchen door to his
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
offscreen father)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I got off to a wrong foot with my own thing, you know. B-b- b-but I need a dramatic change in my life.
	</DIALOGUE>
<FATHER>

	<DIALOGUE>
	But why? We raised you as a Jew.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER>
<MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(shrugging)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, just 'cause I was born that way... You know, I'm old enough to make a mature decision.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey's father walks into view; he stands by the stove near the kitchen doorway, picking up a dirty glass and some bowls to clean.
</DIRECTION>
<FATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But why Jesus Christ? Why, for instance, shouldn't you become a Buddhist?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER>
<DIRECTION>
Holding the dirty dishes in his hand, Mickey's father looks at his son.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(gesturing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A Bud--? That's totally alien to me. Look, you're getting on in years, right? Aren't you afraid of dying?

<DIRECTION>
Mickey's father walks offscreen again, to the kitchen sink.

Mickey starts pounding the door again as the movie cuts to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beautiful snow-covered church downtown, complete with courtyard and wrought-iron fence. A pedestrian walks by with an umbrella. A church choir sings a soaring hymn over the scene.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The music continues as the film moves inside, where the choir is seen singing behind an altar glowing warm gold. A fairly large congregation sits in darkened pews as the film cuts to the back, where Mickey, his arms crossed, stands underneath some stained-glass windows, watching and listening to the inspiring music.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The choir continues to sing as the movie cuts to Father Flynn in his office.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He picks up some large, heavy books from a shelf near his window and he walks over to Mickey, who's standing near his desk, already holding several tomes. Father Flynn puts the books on top of Mickey's pile; Mickey, flipping through the top one, awkwardly carries his bundle to the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Next is seen a close-up of a painting of Jesus Christ on the cross, complete with crown of thorns and holy expression. His eyes, especially designed to blink as the lights hit them, open and close repeatedly. The hymn plays on, loudly, as the camera moves back, revealing Mickey, standing outside a barber shop window, looking at the Christ playing and shuffling from side to side to gets its eyes' 3-D effect. Smaller inspirational pictures border the bigger, blinking Christ. A barber pole with moving stripes stands nearby; passing traffic is reflected in the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey turns from the window, shrugging, and starts to walk down the street, past a fruit and vegetable store with open- air-displayed flowers, past several briskly moving pedestrians.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With the hymn still playing, the screen goes black briefly. Mickey opens the door, the light from a hallway illuminating him. He's just entered his apartment. He closes the door and walks through his dark foyer; he carries a brown bag. He switches on the light, and walking past his spiral staircase, past several framed pictures on the wall, he makes his way to his living room coffee table. Mickey pulls a crucifix out of the bag; he looks at it, then puts it on the table near a pile of books and some objets d'art. He then takes out a copy of the New Testament, putting it on top of the crucifix. Then out comes a framed picture of a saint. It too gets put on the growing pile. But the bag is not yet empty. Next comes a large loaf of Wonder Bread and a large jar of Hellman's mayonnaise. Mickey sets them on top of the saint.

EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lee is walking down the street, looking around her. The sidewalk is fairly crowded with people; the sounds of traffic are heard. She passes some office buildings, a store's large display window; she stops when she sees Hannah. Her sister is waiting outside the Art Deco façade of a restaurant; she's looking in the opposite direction. Lee taps Hannah on the shoulder; Hannah, surprised, turns and gasps.
</DIRECTION>
<LEE>

	Hi.

The sisters laugh and embrace each other.

</HANNAH>
<LEE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yeah? How's she doing?

She turns and walks towards the restaurant entrance.

restaurant's doors)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, God, you know Holly. When she's depressed, she's manic. I think it was a good idea that we invited her to lunch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<DIRECTION>
They disappear inside. The camera follows them, cutting to the restaurant's interior at the same time the sisters walk in. It's a chic, trendy place, with an Art Deco design and high ceilings. A waiter in uniform stands near its glass and metal doors, holding a tray to his chest; a few people sit at the bar; a large plant in a vase sits in the foreground. The sisters walk toward the coatcheck area, deep in conversation.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNAH>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Hannah, she's-she's just embarrassed in front of you, that's all.

Hannah walks offscreen, farther into the coatcheck room. She talks offscreen as Lee alone is seen, reacting and speaking as well. In the background, a waiter crosses over to the bar, then walks away.

Hannah walks out of the coatcheck room without her coat; it's Lee's turn to disappear and check her things. Now only Hannah can be seen onscreen as the sisters talk. In the background, the waiter once again walks over to the bar.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>

	Oh, he's fine. He's-he's, I guess he's fine. I don't know.

	I've been trying to talk to him about it. He says everything's fine, but I don't know. Automatically, you know, I leap to the worst conclusions.

<LEE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like what?

As Hannah answers her sister, Holly can be seen entering the restaurant and walking over to the coatcheck area, an unlit cigarette in her mouth, her sunglasses still on her eyes.
</DIRECTION>

	I mean, I don't know, he's seeing someone else or something, but...

Hannah mumbles indistinctly as Holly walks over to her sisters.

The hostess appears, peeking around the corner of the coatcheck area. She signals for the three sisters to follow her.

	Oh, gosh.

</HANNAH>
<HOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got it.

Holly takes off her sunglasses; her cigarette still dangles from her mouth. Hannah murmurs her sympathy as the trio follows the hostess into the dining room.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I was very polite. I maintained my poise.

<DIRECTION>
(taking out a match for her cigarette)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said hello.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
The sisters walk to their seats, at a round table in the middle of the room; the hostess puts down their menus.
</DIRECTION>
<LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hmm. I never trusted April, you know. She has eyes in the back of her head.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<DIRECTION>
They sit down. The hostess leaves. Other diners are seen in the background; a waiter is taking the order of a couple sitting on a banquette; other waiters clear off a table. Diners walk in and out. A low murmur of conversation, as well as the faint clatter of dishes, is heard. The camera moves closer to the three sisters, circling the table as Holly speaks.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, well, she and an architect are now a very definite item, which I still cannot believe.

	But what I decided to do is some writing. Yeah, I think I've had it with acting. You know, these meaningless auditions at cattle calls. And I can't handle another rejection.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Now let's face it here. I gotta, you know, latch on to something in my life. You know--something with a future. I'm not sixteen anymore.

	It's just...crazy!

	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got...an idea for a story. More than one. And I just need a few months, you know, or, uh, a year even.

As the camera slowly circles the table, Hannah is seen listening to Holly, her hand on her mouth.

	I've picked up a lot about dramatic structure from doing my scenes in acting class.

Lee, her hand on her mouth, glances briefly at Hannah. As Hannah replies to Holly, the camera focuses on Lee's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She bites her nails; she looks down, involved in her own thoughts.

<HANNAH>

	Well, that-that's good. It just, uh...it just seems to me that-that six months or a year, if-if you spent it more productively...

Lee looks up, her hand still on her mouth, watching Hannah, as the camera slowly moves off her to show Hannah.

<HANNAH>

	Yeah, that's clerical.

	No. She, didn't she say it was, um...she said it was in the publicity department. That-that can lead to other things.

The camera is back on Lee. She looks around tensely, barely listening to the conversation. She fidgets. An empty table sits in the background.

The camera, slowly circling the table, is back on Lee's face. While her sisters argue emotionally on her right and left, she is looking down, biting her lip. She is outwardly still, but her face is registering her seething emotions.

Summer in New York.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A piano plays "Bewitched" in the background as the film cuts to a large tree, covered with bright white blossoms. The camera moves down the tree to reveal a well-kept, red-brick brownstone on a pleasant, sunny New York City street. A man wearing a summer suit walks by as the film moves inside the building, to Elliot's analyst's office. The psychotherapist sits in a comfortable armchair next to a curtained window. In front of the window sits a table covered with artifacts and a large lamp. The analyst's fingers are touching, his arms resting on the chair, as he listens to the offscreen Elliot.

Hare Krishna music is heard over a sunlit view of the Manhattan skyline and the green trees of Central Park. The camera moves down to reveal a large group of Hare Krishnas dancing on the broad green lawn among other New Yorkers enjoying the day. The leader, holding some pamphlets, stands by a chain-link fence, a few feet away from his group, talking to someone on the other side. It's Mickey, as the camera soon shows, wearing a short-sleeved shirt, a paper tucked under his arm.

Bach's Concerto for Harpsichord is heard as the film cuts to the waterfront at dusk. A bench faces some wharf pilings; the water gently laps against them as Lee walks into view, the wind blowing her hair. She stands and faces the water and the distant skyline across the bay. The view is contemplative, beautiful in the dim light.

Lee is alone; her hands are in her pockets. Lee, thinking, is heard over the scene; the harpsichord music plays in the background.

The concerto stops and the movie cuts to Holly, leaning into an open phone booth near a subway entrance. She wears a football jacket, jeans, and sneakers; she holds a manuscript in her arms. It's a busy corner. People rush past Holly towards the subway; others are walking up the station steps. Holly smokes a cigarette as she talks on the phone to Hannah.

INT. HANNAH'S APARTMENT - THANKSGIVING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's Thanksgiving at Hannah's once again. Guests are crowded together in the living room, surrounding the piano, where Evan is sitting and flipping through some sheet music. Norma stands behind him, leaning against a book-laden wall. The guests are chattering, enjoying themselves; a lamp glows on the corner of the piano. A little boy sitting in a chair next to Evan is talking animatedly with a girl who is leaning over the arm of the sofa. An adult guest talks to the little boy; another guest takes a sip of wine from a glass she'd placed on the bookshelf behind her as Evan turns and addresses the group.

Evan continues to laugh with everyone as he starts to play the piano. A nearby woman toasts him with her drink. The camera moves around the room as he plays, showing the various guests, chattering over the music. Some are in clusters, in private conversations; others listen and watch the offscreen Evan. A couple stands by the window; one man gets up from his chair and walks away. Some guests sip their drinks, smiling, as the camera moves back to the piano and the book-laden wall. Evan is playing the piano with exuberance. Norma, still standing behind him, has a poignant, wistful expression on her face. She mouths the words to the song Evan is playing, "It Could Happen to You." The woman next to her smiles, enjoying the music, as the camera continues its exploration, moving to a man standing in the doorway with a group of children. Mavis the maid walks by with a tray of hors d'oeuvres. The man takes one, mouthing his thanks, as the camera travels past the open bookshelf, past two boys in suits who are drinking soda and munching, to reveal Lee. She is leaning against another doorway, a faraway look on her face as she listens to the music. Mavis passes in the hall beyond the doorway. Several people, deep in conversation, stand nearby as Elliot, holding a drink, walks up behind her.

	It's been nearly a year since our first time and you're still married to my sister, which...I now realize is fine because you're probably much more in love with her than you know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(shaking his head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but we-we made so many plans.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(overlapping, gesturing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Uh, well, sure we did. An- an-and in a way you led me on, because I truly believed you were unhappy with Hannah. Otherwise, I would never have let myself be drawn in. I was very weak. So were you. Now I've met someone else.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens and Mavis appears, holding a set of candlesticks. She walks over to the dining room table, which is already decked out with a floral centerpiece, glassware, and china. She puts them down as Lee and Elliot stand awkwardly near the door, waiting for her to leave.
</DIRECTION>
<LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Mavis)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dinner soon?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<MAVIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	About fifteen minutes.

</MAVIS>
<LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(nodding)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh-huh. Good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<DIRECTION>
Mavis leaves. Both Lee and Elliot quickly close the door behind her and immediately pick up where they'd left off.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you're in love overnight?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I care a great deal about him, yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<ELLIOT>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Lee...

</ELLIOT>
<LEE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, it's over! Elliot, I mean it. It's over!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<DIRECTION>
They look at each other, reacting, as the film cuts back to Hannah's kitchen. Norma's face can be seen in the porthole window on the other side of the pantry's swinging door. She looks around the kitchen, then opens the door and steps inside. Holly stands nearby, working in the pantry area.
</DIRECTION>
<NORMA>
<DIRECTION>
(holding the door,
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	half in and half out
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
of the kitchen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sweetheart, I loved your script. I thought it was so clever.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORMA>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(turning to Norma,
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	smiling, and holding
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
a glass of wine)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you're my mother. Not everybody's gonna be such a sucker.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<NORMA>
<DIRECTION>
(gesturing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I particularly liked the character of the mother. Just a boozy old flirt with a filthy mouth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORMA>
<DIRECTION>
Holly chuckles.
</DIRECTION>
<NORMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm so proud!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORMA>
<HOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Mom, thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
Norma steps back out of the kitchen, the door swinging shut behind her. Holly looks at the door, sipping her wine, as the movie cuts back to Hannah's living room. A chubby, friendly uncle sits on a sofa, one child on his lap and several others gathered cross-legged around him on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They lean on the coffee table, which is covered with glasses and a bowl of chips. Other guests mingle in the background; one couple enters the living room, smiling at the scene on the sofa. Mavis crosses the well-lit foyer in the background and opens the door to more guests. The piano plays on.
</DIRECTION>
<UNCLE>
<DIRECTION>
(raising his bottle of beer to the children)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now here's a toast to Thanksgiving, all right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</UNCLE>
<DIRECTION>
The children mutter their enthusiastic agreement, picking up their "illicit" glasses of beer.
</DIRECTION>
<UNCLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are we supposed to have beer? Yeeeah!
	</DIALOGUE>
</UNCLE>
<DIRECTION>
The uncle pours more beer from his bottle into the kids' outstretched glasses. They cry indistinctly with excitement.
</DIRECTION>
<UNCLE>
<DIRECTION>
(overlapping the children's squeals of delight)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me at it!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to one of the little boys)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's that, Fletcher?
	</DIALOGUE>
</UNCLE>
<DIRECTION>
Laughing, he turns to the little girl sitting on his lap; he clinks his bottle against the bottle she is holding, which is almost as big as she is.
</DIRECTION>
<UNCLE>
<DIRECTION>
(to the little girl)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doll? To Thanksgiving. Here's a little toast, doll.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(clinking glasses)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on. Bottoms up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</UNCLE>
<DIRECTION>
The uncle and the children happily drink their beer as the movie cuts to a wall with subtly patterned wallpaper in Hannah's bedroom. Her face moves on to the screen.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
(to the offscreen Elliot)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you been talking to Holly or Lee about us? About our-our personal life?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(offscreen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me? Of course not.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HANNAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's things Holly wrote about in her script about us that are so...personal they could only have come from you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>

(offscreen)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I've got a splitting headache and I don't like being accused.

</ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
Hannah walks towards Elliot; he's in the bathroom standing over the sink.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
(gesturing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not accusing. I'm asking. Do you...do you find me too...too giving?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(closing the door of
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	the bathroom slightly so only she is seen
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
on the screen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too-too-too competent? Too-too, I don't know, disgustingly perfect or something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH>
<ELLIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
Elliot walks from behind the partially closed door to an offscreen medicine cabinet.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
(following Elliot and
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	gesturing, talking to
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
his back)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, what is it then? What? Eh, what's come between us? How have I alienated you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(taking a bottle of
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	aspirin from the cabinet and walking
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
back to the sink, gesturing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hannah, my head is throbbing.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
(gesturing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You never want to talk about it. I-- Every time I bring it up, you- you change the subject. What is it? Do you-- We're communicating less and less. You sleep with me less and less.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(angrily turning to
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hannah and pointing
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
as she shouts)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hannah, I am very mixed up! Now please!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
Elliot turns back to the sink, once again obscured by the partially closed door.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
(reacting, her voice
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	trembling slightly,
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
and gesturing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you talk to Holly or Lee behind my back? Do you? You must. They- they seem to know so much about us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(walking towards a towel rack and gesturing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, maybe I've asked advice once or twice or-or made a joke.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
He dries his hands as Hannah, standing behind him, continues to talk.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
(gesturing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, what do you do? Do-do-do you talk to Holly, or Lee, or what? Do you, do you, do you phone them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(whirling around to face Hannah, snapping)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leave me alone, can you?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
He closes the door, briefly obscuring Hannah and himself from view.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing in a lower tone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, I've told you. I need someone I can matter to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
The camera moves behind the closed door, into the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
(reacting, near tears)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You matter to me. Completely.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(pausing, his voice rising again)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's hard to be around someone who gives so much and-and needs so little in return!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
He opens the medicine cabinet and puts the aspirin bottle back.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
(gesturing, pleading)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But, look...I-I have enormous needs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
Elliot slams the medicine cabinet shut.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(shouting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I can't see them, and neither can Lee or Holly!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
He leaves. Hannah watches him go, reacting. She is stunned.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HANNAH'S LIVING ROOM - ANOTHER NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dark hallway is illuminated by light coming from the offscreen foyer; pictures line the wall. Piano music is still heard very softly in the background as Hannah, hugging herself, walks slowly down the hallway into the living room. She briefly looks around, lost in thought. She sits down heavily, tiredly, on the arm of the couch as the movie cuts to several framed photographs on the mantel. One shows Hannah and Elliot on their wedding day. Another shows Elliot, obscured in the shadows. Yet another has captured Norma as a young girl. The camera, however, moves closer and closer to a photograph showing Hannah, Lee, and Holly, the three sisters, smiling into the camera. There is no sound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HANNAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The film shows the bedroom night table, holding a small lamp, a wooden box, a cast-iron fire truck, an ashtray, and glasses. Elliot's pajama-clad arm moves into view. He turns off the lamp; the room is now pitch-black.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
(offscreen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's so pitch-black tonight. I feel lost.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(offscreen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not lost.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
Elliot turns the lamp back on, then turns to Hannah; she is lying on her side of the bed, partially in shadow. He leans over and kisses her.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you so much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
They begin to kiss passionately as "Bewitched" starts to play in the background.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lucky I ran into you.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"Bewitched" continues as the film cuts to a busy nighttime New York City street. Mickey, his hands in his pockets, walks along the sidewalk, one person among many other pedestrians. He pulls his coat tighter around him as he walks. "Bewitched" continues to play as he passes Tower Records' neon-lit window. He glances inside...and sees Holly, her jacket flung over her shoulders, looking at some records.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey walks through the revolving doors of Tower Records, up a few stairs to the selling floor proper, and stops right in front of Holly.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>

<MICKEY>

(touching Holly's shoulder)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I hope you've changed.

<HOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I hope you have, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(overlapping)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope so for your sake, because, uh, your personality left something to be desired...

</HOLLY>
<HOLLY>

(overlapping, shaking her head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, and for yours. I'm sure you've changed.

</HOLLY>
<MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...namely a personality.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
Holly chuckles and turns to look at more records. She walks down the aisle, occasionally glancing at the bins of records. Mickey walks beside her.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So how are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<HOLLY>

</MICKEY>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(gesturing, looking at Mickey)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

As Mickey continues to speak, Holly walks to another bin of records, reacting to his words. She looks offscreen at him, then down at some records. The camera follows her.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>

(offscreen, continuing)
</DIRECTION>

	I may, I may have to get back into it, 'cause my accountant says that I'm running out of dollars. But...but, um, no, I haven't, I just sort of dropped out for a year...

Mickey walks back onscreen to Holly. The two of them are partially obscured by a large white Jazz sign imprinted with a large red circle as they continue their conversation.

	Yeah.

Mickey pulls out a record and looks at it.

<MICKEY>

Holly looks hopefully at Mickey.

Holly laughs, embarrassed, as Mickey puts the record he's been looking at back in the bin.

Holly chuckles, looking off for a moment.

There is a brief pause and the movie cuts to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MICKEY'S APARTMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The screen shows a chaise in Mickey's apartment; an ashtray on a stand sits nearby. The camera moves down the chaise, past several piles of books, to Mickey's coffee table. He sits, picking at his fingers and listening, on the edge of the table in front of Holly, who is sitting cross-legged on the floor, propped up with a pillow, reading her script aloud.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(offscreen, as the
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	camera moves across the room towards her

<DIRECTION>
and Mickey, reading)

	<DIALOGUE>
	"We all go through life playing the hand we're dealt. Craig: And what hand were you dealt?

	<DIALOGUE>
	"Emily: I'm two high pair, maybe even aces up. The problem is, you've got three deuces."

<DIRECTION>
Holly closes the script and looks up at Mickey.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the end.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey smiles and shrugs, not knowing what to say.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you can tell me straight. It's okay. Just, you know, tell me what you think.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(shaking his head, shrugging)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's great. I swea-- I'm-- I'm, tch, I'm speechless. I was...I was not in the mood to listen to this thing now.

<DIRECTION>
(sighing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know what to say. I'm moved and I laughed and I-- Uh, I, you know, I was on the edge of my seat. I just think it's wonderful! I'm, I'm totally...stunned. This is not an insult. I'm amazed that you can...

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes! I was abso-- And...w- what...made you think of that climax scene where the, where the... architect is walking home with his actress girlfriend and-and the ex- wife who's schizophrenic jumps out of the bushes and stabs him to death?

<DIRECTION>
(smiling and shaking his head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fabulous, I mean it! I'm so impressed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
Holly, thrilled with Mickey's overwhelming response, stands up, her hand on her head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unable to contain herself, she begins to walk up and down the room, holding her script. The camera follows her; Mickey is now offscreen.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(laughing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, God!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, gee. Would you like to have lunch? Uh, uh...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(offscreen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I-I would love to talk to you about, uh, that script. I-I, you know, I think maybe that we could do something with it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(nodding)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, and listen, I would like to hear what made you suddenly decide to drop out of life.

</HOLLY>
<MICKEY>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, who cares?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Y-you used to-- Oh, no! Yeah, I care. You used to be so ambitious and...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pausing, grinning)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God, you really liked it?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
"You Made Me Love You" starts to play as the movie cuts to the street outside Mickey's apartment house, an old building complete with a red entrance door and a gray, weather-beaten façade. Trees line the sidewalk. Holly and Mickey emerge from the door and walk up the street, revealing a whole row of similar apartment buildings. They pass a few other people as they walk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The film then moves to the outside of a charming glass and stainedwood café. Through the window, Holly and Mickey can be seen having lunch. Holly is talking animatedly; Mickey takes a sip of coffee. Some people pass by.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Next, the film cuts to an almost isolated path in Central Park, complete, with old-fashioned streetlamps and scattered leaves. Holly and Mickey stroll into view, deep in conversation.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(gesturing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gosh, you really went through a crisis, you know that? H-how did you get over it? I mean, when I ran into you, you seemed, you seemed just perfectly fine. Well, you seem fine now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(chuckling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll tell you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(sighing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One day about a month ago...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
The film abruptly cuts to Mickey's flashback, a visual counterpoint to the story he is telling Holly. A close-up of a nervous, perspiring, and panting Mickey alone in his apartment appears on the screen as his voice is heard.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I really hit bottom. You know, I just felt that in a Godless universe, I didn't want to go on living. Now I happen to own this rifle...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(coughing)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey raises the barrel of a rifle to his forehead. He shuts his eyes tightly.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...which I loaded, believe it or not, and pressed it to my forehead. And I remember thinking, at the time, I'm gonna kill myself. Then I thought...what if I'm wrong? What if there is a God? I mean, after all, nobody really knows that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
The camera moves past the desperate Mickey to a mirror on the wall behind him. Its reflection shows his spiral staircase and some standing lamps. A clock faintly ticks.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But then I thought, no. You know, maybe is not good enough. I want certainty or nothing. And I remember very clearly the clock was ticking, and I was sitting there frozen, with the gun to my head, debating whether to shoot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
The gun goes off with a loud bang. The mirror shatters.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All of a sudden, the gun went off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey, holding the rifle, is seen running over to the shattered mirror. The sounds of his excited neighbors, their shouting, a knocking door, are heard as he continues his tale.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had been so tense, my finger had squeezed the trigger inadvertently...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<NEIGHBOR_1>
<DIRECTION>
(offscreen, overlapping)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's happening? Wh-wh-what's going on?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEIGHBOR_1>
<MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...but I was perspiring so much, the gun had slid off my forehead and missed me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<NEIGHBOR_2>
<DIRECTION>
(offscreen, overlapping)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. I heard a gun. Is everything all right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEIGHBOR_2>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey, still brandishing the rifle, runs into his sunlit living room. He looks around frantically, his shirt loose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, he throws the rifle down between the sofa and the coffee table. The gun goes off a second time. Mickey, standing nearby, jumps, his hands flying to his head. The doorbell rings; the neighbors begin pounding at the door.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And suddenly, neighbors were, were, pounding on the door, and-and I don't know, the whole scene was just pandemonium. And, uh, you know, and I-I-I-I-I ran to the door.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey runs offscreen briefly to answer the door.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I-I-I-I didn't know what to say. You know, I was, I was embarrassed and confused, and my-my-my mind was r-r-racing a mile a minute...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
He returns onscreen, panting; he looks frantically once again around the living room.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and I-I jus knew one thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
The film cuts to a West Side street. It's an overcast day. Mickey, walking slowly along the sidewalk, passes several other pedestrians and numerous storefronts, including Klein's Pharmacy and a "Bar-B-Q" take out. Occasionally, he is obscured by a tree trunk on the opposite side of the street; a few taxis go by as he talks over the scene.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I...I-I-I-I had to get out of that house. I had to just get out in the fresh air and-and clear my head. And I remember very clearly. I walked the streets. I walked and I walked. I-I didn't know what was going through my mind. It all seemed so violent and un-unreal to me. And I wandered...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
The movie cuts to the exterior of the Metro movie theater, with its smoked glass entrance doors and its Art Deco feel. An old publicity photo hangs inside. Mickey's reflection is seen at the almost-transparent doors, as well as the reflection of the street and various cars whizzing by. His reflection walks towards the theater entrance; he continues his story.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...for a long time on the Upper West Side, you know, an-and it must have been hours! You know, my, my feet hurt. My head was, was pounding, and, and I had to sit down. I went into a movie house. I-I didn't know what was playing or anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey walks into the movie house. He is seen through the glass doors, which still reflect the street and traffic outside. He makes his way through the lobby into the actual theater.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just, I just needed a moment to gather my thoughts and, and be logical, and, and put the world back into rational perspective.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
The film abruptly cuts to the theater's black-and-white screen, where the Marx Brothers, in Duck Soup, play the helmets of several soldiers standing in a line like a live xylophone. The sounds of the "xylophone" are heard as the movie cuts to the darkened theater, where Mickey slowly sits down in a balcony seat. The "xylophone" music stops and changes to "Hidee-hidee-hidee-hidee-hidee-hidee-ho" as sung by the Marx Brothers and ensemble in the movie. The singing continues faintly in the background as Mickey continues his tale:
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I went upstairs to the balcony, and I sat down
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(sighing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	and, you know, the movie was a-a-a film that I'd seen many times in my life since I was a kid, an-and I always u-uh, loved it. And, you know, I'm, I'm watching these people up on the screen, and I started getting hooked o-on the film, you know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
The film cuts back to the black-and-white movie screen as Mickey continues to talk. The Marx Brothers, as well as the hundred-odd other cast members in Duck Soup, are kneeling and bowing as they sing "Hidee-hidee-ho." They kick their heels up in the air. They sway back and forth, hands clasped, singing "Oh-h-h-h-h-h..."
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...And I started to feel how can you even think of killing yourself? I mean, isn't it so stupid? I mean, l-look at all the people up there on the screen. You know, they're real funny, and, and what if the worst is true?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
The movie cuts back to Mickey, sitting almost obscured in the dark theater. The Oh-h-h-h-h-h's coming from the offscreen movie are heard as he continues to speak.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if there's no God, and you only go around once and that's it? Well, you know, don't you want to be part of the experience? You know, what the hell, it-i-it's not all a drag. And I'm thinking to myself, geez, I should stop ruining my life...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
As Mickey talks, the film cuts back to the antics of the Marx Brothers on the black-and-white theater screen. The four brothers are now swaying and singing and strutting, their voices indistinct over Mickey's narration.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...searching for answers I'm never gonna get, and just enjoy it while it lasts. And...you know...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
The film is back on Mickey's dark form in the audience.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...after, who knows? I mean, you know, maybe there is something. Nobody really knows. I know, I know "maybe" is a very slim reed to hang your whole life on, but that's the best we have. And...then, I started to sit back, and I actually began to enjoy myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
As Mickey continues, the film cuts back to Duck Soup on the black-and-white screen. The Marx Brothers are sitting on a judge's bench, playing banjos and singing with the other cast members. They jump down from the bench, still singing. Their voices swell.
</DIRECTION>
<MARX_BROTHERS_COMPANY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Oh, Freedonia Oh, don't you cry for me They'll be coming around the mountain..."
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARX_BROTHERS_COMPANY>
<DIRECTION>
The Marx Brothers kneel, strumming their banjos, and the movie cuts back to Central Park. The flashback is over. Mickey and Holly continue their stroll as "You Made Me Love You" begins to play in the background. They pass some people, a cluster of buildings that look like castles, and the Manhattan skyline as seen through the trees, as the camera moves back, farther and farther away from them, showing a beautiful Central Park, frozen in time.

INT. HANNAH'S APARTMENT - THANKSGIVING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A large, perfectly roasted turkey on a serving plate briefly fills the screen as the camera moves across the food-laden table in Hannah's kitchen, past an electric mixer, several bowls, spices, tomatoes, and parsley, to reveal Evan walking through the doorway.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. I'll get some ice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<DIRECTION>
Lee walks off, drying her wet hands in the air. Hannah, in a silk dress, moves onscreen, going to the table and pouring herself a glass of wine as Norma enters the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<NORMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hannah, can I tell everybody you're going to play Desdemona?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORMA>
<DIRECTION>
Norma walks over to a glass-doored cabinet and takes out a bottle of gin.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
(taking a big sip of her wine)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Mom, it's only television.

</DIRECTION>
<NORMA>
<DIRECTION>
(gesturing with the bottle)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, but it's public television. And to me, Shakespeare doesn't get any greater than Othello. You with some big black stud! I love it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORMA>
<DIRECTION>
Norma unscrews the liquor bottle and pours some into her empty glass as Hannah stops her mashing, reacting.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
(gasping and laughing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Mom!

The movie leaves the kitchen and cuts to the doorway between the dining room and the living room. Upbeat jazz plays over the low din of the party. Two women stand by the partially set dining room table, chatting and arranging some plates, as Elliot strolls into view, sipping a drink. He passes the women and walks through the doorway into the living room, nodding hello to a guest who is walking the other way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He enters the living room, smiling. It is crowded with guests; Hannah's children play in their midst. One of Hannah's boys grabs Elliot's arm. They playfully "spar" for a moment before Elliot laughingly shakes him off, continuing on his way into a connecting room. He stops at the doorway, looking at the crowd. The camera shows his point of view: Guests stand in clusters, enjoying themselves; one woman chats with a little boy; another woman, carrying a drink, walks over to a group of other guests.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The film then cuts back briefly to Elliot, holding his drink and looking straight ahead, as it shows his point of view once more. This time he sees a smiling Lee and Doug, talking animatedly; a few guests are seen in the background. Elliot's voice is heard over a close-up of the couple.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Lee, you are something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
Lee and Doug kiss each other. They continue talking.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You look very beautiful. Marriage agrees with you. Everything that happened between us
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pausing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	seems more and more hazy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
As Lee takes a sip of her drink, the movie cuts back to Elliot, standing in the doorway and still staring straight ahead. The camera moves in closer to his face as he talks over the scene.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I acted like such a fool. I don't know what came over me. That complete conviction that I couldn't live without you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
The film quickly cuts to a brief look at Lee and Doug, still talking animatedly and smiling. Lee gently pushes back Doug's hair.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did I put us both through? And Hannah...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
The camera moves back to Elliot.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...who as you once said, I love much more than I realized.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
After pausing for a moment on Elliot's face, the film cuts to the foyer, where two boys and a girl gather by the door. One boy opens it, revealing Holly. She joyfully enters the apartment, greeting each child with an enthusiastic kiss.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(kissing the children)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi! How are you!

The jazz ends as the record scratches and stops. Evan's rendition of "Isn't It Romantic" is heard on the piano as Holly, shrugging the strap of her pocketbook off her shoulder, walks towards the living room. She is stopped by three guests--two women, one of them wearing glasses, and a man--who are coming out of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLY>

	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
The movie cuts to Hannah, leaning contentedly against a doorway into the living room and listening to the offscreen Evan play the piano. Elliot, holding his drink, walks over to her. They look at each other for a beat; Elliot then hugs Hannah, pulling her towards him. She leans her head on his shoulder, fingering his jacket lapel. They look offscreen together, happily, intimately, at the offscreen guests, as the camera moves across the room, past a few guests, to reveal Evan sitting at the piano. Norma sits at his side, one arm resting on the piano. She holds a drink and looks off in the distance, mouthing the words to "Isn't It Romantic."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The camera then moves to the doorway in the living room, where a man, holding a drink, enters and joins the happy crowd. Evan can be seen in the background, playing his song. A child plays near the coffee table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The camera continues to move past the doorway, past a huge grandfather clock, to a second doorway leading to the den. Here, more guests are gathered; a child sits in a small chair by the sofa. He sips a soda as female guest #2 enters the room and crouches down next to him, smiling. She waves to him. He waves back as the camera continues to move past the doorway to reveal Holly, standing in front of a hallway mirror, fixing her earrings. Mavis can be seen in the background, through the doorway into the dining room, lighting the candles on the table. She dims the lights, darkening the room and the hallway where Holly stands in a warm candlelit glow. Mavis leaves the dining room and passes Holly.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(still fixing her earrings, to Mavis)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's beautiful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
Mavis walks off. Holly, reflected in the mirror, begins fluffing her hair as Mickey enters and wraps his arms around her from behind. The camera stays focused on the mirror; both Holly and Mickey are now seen in its reflection.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>

(smacking his lips)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now don't get nervous. It's just your husband.

<MICKEY>

</MICKEY>
<HOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>

(kissing her again)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You look so beautiful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey continues to kiss Holly. She responds, sighing and closing her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(kissing Holly's neck)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, I was talking with your father before...and I was telling him that

<DIRECTION>
(kissing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	it's ironic. I-I used to always have Thanksgiving with Hannah...and I never thought
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(kissing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	that I could love anybody else.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(kissing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And here it is, years later and I'm married to you
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(kissing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	and completely in love with you.

<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	It really is. I...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(kissing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It'd made a great story, I think. A guy marries one sister...

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	doesn't work out...

<MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know how you're gonna top that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey continues to kiss Holly's neck; he chuckles.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(kissing Mickey's cheek)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mickey?

<MICKEY>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Mmm, what?

</MICKEY>
<HOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm pregnant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
The mirror shows Mickey pulling away slightly, reacting. They look at each other at arm's length, Holly grinning. Mickey in shock, then embrace and kiss passionately, tighter and tighter, as the music swells...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And the credits appear, white on a black screen.
