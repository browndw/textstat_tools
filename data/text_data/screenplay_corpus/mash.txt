:SC: EXT. LANDING AREA IUTSIDE 4077th MASH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Our attention is concentrated on a sign reading: "THIS IS WHERE IT IS - PARALLEL 38." Below these words, arrows point to "NORTH KOREA" in one direction, "SOUTH KOREA" in opposite one. Two Air Rescue helicopters are coming in low from the north, descending to a point just outside the entrance to the hospital Admitting Ward. Transferring our attention to the helicopters, our gaze goes from the first sign to a second one, on which all we can read at first are the very large letters: "M-A-S-H." Moving closer to the helicopters as they hit the ground, we can make out the rest of the sign. Above the four large letters it says: "4077TH," and then we see there is the remainder of a word following each of the large letters, but in much smaller print, so that "M-A-S-H" becomes "Mobile Army Surgical Hospital." The helicopters land and enlisted men of the U.S. Army Medical Corps Carry two wounded soldiers from each into the Admitting Ward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LIEUTENANT COLONEL HENRY BLAKE, a permanent member of the Medical Corps and Commanding Officer of the 4077th, watches grimly as the wounded are borne from the helicopters into his hospital. CORPORAL "RADAR" O'REILLY, with a long thin neck, large ears and a knack for anticipating his Colonel's wishes, moves up close behind him.

Two officers come from opposite directions toward a Jeep, each carrying a Valpac and trailing a barracks bag. Though they still wear such later-to-be-discarded refinements as captain's bars on their caps and overcoats, they are far from West Point standards in dress and manner. DUKE, 29, is still solidly built like the fullback he once was. HAWKEYE, 28, a former end, is taller and rangier, wears glasses. Their accents, Georgia and Maine respectively, are in sharp contrast. A MOTOR POOL SARGEANT who has driven the Jeep up climbs out.

Hawkeye and Duke are driving the Jeep along the muddy road - they come upon a sign which fills a large part of the screen: "Last chance before Peking." A short distance behind the sign, it is now revealed are three parked U.S. Army trucks, in front of which parades a group of Korean prostitutes from fourteen to forty-five. Despite the autumn weather, their costumes, mixed American mail order and Korean, are chosen for seductive appeal rather than warmth.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hawkeye stops the Jeep as they come to a place in the road where they can get a downward look at their future home. The river valley in which the 4077th Mash is situated is almost surrounded by mountains. The components of the post are spread out in a rough horseshoe with a large compound of level ground in the middle. At the closed end of the horseshoe is the main hospital building, made of wood with a tin roof marked by a large red cross; everything else is canvas. To the left of the main building are strung out the Admitting Ward, Laboratory, Dental Clinic, Mess Hall, PX, Showers Tent, Barber Tent and the Enlisted Men's Tents. On the right side are the Postop Ward, Officers' Tents, Nurses' Tents, Korean Domestics' Tents and finally, the Officers' Club. In the f.g., from Duke and Hawkeye's angle are four helicopters belonging to the 5th Air Rescue Squadron, and the signs we have already seen marking the post and the 38th Parallel.

:SC: INT. MASH MESS HALL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Hawkeye and Duke enter. The large tent has two floor levels separated by a railing into a section for officers and one for enlisted men, the two groups being much closer to numerical equality here than in an ordinary military installation. There is a further voluntary piece of segregation within the officers' section: the men - medical officers plus a couple of administrative officers and a helicopter pilot - are at one long, rectangular table; the nurses, ranging in rank from second lieutentant to captain, at another.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hawkeye starts to lead the way to an empty table in the officers' section, but Duke calls his attention to the outstanding feature of the nurses' table: LIEUTENTANT DISH, twenty-four, blonde and clearly, even in her winter fatigues, the sexiest looking nurse in military history.
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you think of that piece of scenery, Yankee boy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<HAWKEYE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Finest kind. We'll sit where we can get the best view.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWKEYE>
<DIRECTION>
Accordingly, they select seats close to the nurses and facing the Lieutenant. Some personnel are on duty in the hospital during this lunch period, but beside Dish, two of the following three nurses with whom we will become acquainted are present here:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KNOCKO, who is black, a captain in her thirties, solidly built, very strong and very competent in her job; LESLIE, also a captain, not more than thirty, bright, attractive, cheerful, the kind of girl that brings out the latent male matrimonial instinct but who, strangely, is treated as inviolate by the by the sex-starved men of the post; and LIEUTENANT SCORCH, who can't match Dish or Leslie by physical standards but has the asset of instant availability.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Korean boy, not yet of military age, in green fatigue pants and an off-white coat, appears promptly and heaps Duke and Hawkeye's plates with food. Duke is hungry enough to turn his whole attention to the meal, but Hawkeye is unable to keep his eyes off Lieutenant Dish while eating. Thus neither of them is aware of the attention they are getting from the male officers' group, which includes HENRY, a couple of medical captains named MURRHARDT and BANDINI; DAGO RED (officially, Father John Patrick Mulcahy, red-haired Catholic Chaplain of the area) and the PAINLESS POLE (Captain Walter Waldowski, Dental Officer), both in their thirties; and CAPTAIN UGLY JOHN BLACK, an Australian anesthesiologist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is also curiousity about the newcomers from the unlisted men's section, where we see among others RADAR; VOLLMER, Henry's overweight Sargeant Major; CORPORAL JUDSON, young, black and fresh from Mississippi; PRIVATE BOONE, who looks too young and nervous to be in any man's army; and PFC SEIDMAN, whose first trip out of New York has taken him halfway around the world.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Henry, who alone has reason to be personally affronted by Duke and Hawkeye's unmilitary behavior, gets up and crosses to where they are sitting.

In contrast to the opening scene, where the casualties were a generalized fact seen at a distance, in this scene they are viewed individually and at close range, and the effect, both on the eye and the ear, is almost unbearable. Hawkeye, in a white gown as are all the surgeons and nurses, moves from a patient he has just examined to one who is letting out a number of unintelligible SOUNDS mixed in with such clear and frequently repeated words as "Christ," "Mother," "God damn" and "Please." As Hawkeye approaches, Lieutentant Scorch removes enough of the bandaging done in the field to display an abdomen with part of its contents on the outside.

This time there is no doubt about the surgical process we are watching; we see the almost severed leg and the process of controlling bleeding; then the limb is actually separated from its stump and handed by Duke to a corpsman. Hawkeye speaks to the nurse standing behind him.

Lieutenant Dish comes out of the Operating Room, tears in her eyes, trying to control her sobs, and moves just outside the circle of light from the fixture over the entrance. There, no longer under observation, she lets herself cry. Hawkeye comes out the door, registers surprise at the sight of her just as if he hadn't followed her out. He moves to her side and puts a comforting arm around her. She looks up just long enough to see who it is, then buries her head on his shoulder as his other arm goes around her.

First we see Hawkeye sitting on his cot, looking across the tent at the newcomer. Attached to the canvas wall behind him is a photograph of his wife and two sons, aged four and two. Next we turn our attention to Duke on the adjoining cot (formerly Frank's). He also has a family picture on display: his wife, two-year-old daughter and an infant. Then we get our first glimpse of TRAPPER JOHN, their new tentmate, about 30, tall and very thin, his head pretty well hidden inside the hood of a parka. He is using cellophane tape to install one of the popular nude photos of the day (such as the one of Marilyn Monroe that circulated so widely in the early 1950's). Completing the group is Ho-Jon, who sits on the floor, silently taking in everything that is done or said.

Finished with his decorating effort, Trapper reaches into the depths of his parka to produce a can of beer. He digs into the other side, finds an opener and opens the beer. Then his head goes back inside the parka along with the can as he takes a swig from it.

TIME LAPSE:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. OPERATING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There are two operations going on, one of them being a simple procedure requiring one surgeon and one nurse. The other by contrast is a very special event. Trapper is operating, assisted by another surgeon, a couple of nurses, a corpsman, and the anesthesiologist, UGLY JOHN BLACK. Beside these actual participants almost all the nurses and doctors from both shifts, including Duke, Hawkeye (with Lieutenant Dish), Frank and Henry, are in a circle around the operating table as spectators.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trapper's job is repairing a lacerated pulmonary artery, or some other delicate piece of surgery close to the heart and involving a large chest incision. We see enough of the process to observe that it is gory and deep inside a critical area, but necessarily it is the reactions of the people watching, especially Duke and Hawkeye, that tell us how tricky an operation it is and how expertly Trapper is handling it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sequence is silent except for incidental operating room noises. Even Trapper's occasional terse instructions to his assistants and his brief exchange with Ugly John are spoken too low for us to hear. There are four stages to the action:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
1. The beginning of the operation before an attentive audience, drawn by their interest in the new man and by the fact that this is a surgical procedure they have never dared to attempt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
2. Limited approval and professional respect for the assurance with which Trapper plots his incision and starts working his way to his destination.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
3. Mounting tension as the crucial stage is reached. The suspense reaches its crest during the few moments when Trapper is doing the actual mending job to which all the preliminaries have led. The faces of his colleagues express anxiety and hope that he can accomplish what he set out to do, and accomplish it quickly enough to permit the patient to survive. Henry, not certain of his own judgement, looks to Duke for confirmation, and Duke nods to indicate he thinks Trapper has the situation under control.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
4. The tension breaks as Trapper finishes the job to his satisfaction and begins, along with his assistant surgeon, to close up. Henry's smile of relief is unsure and only tentative until he catches Hawkeye's signal that the job has been done to perfection.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

:SC: EXT. MASH COMPOUND - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trapper, Hawkeye and Duke emerge from the hospital in fatigues. Some enlisted men are tossing a football around. One of them makes a wild throw and the ball rolls to a stop at Trapper's feet. He stops to look at it and the other two halt with him. Then very slowly, Trapper leans over and picks up the ball, waving Hawkeye downfield.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hawkeye complies unquestioningly and when he is about thirty yards away, Trapper whips a perfect pass into his arms. Hawkeye just stands where he is, holding the ball, oblivious of the enlisted men who want it back, as Trapper and Duke continue toward him. Revelation jolts him with apocalyptic force.

They look across the compound to the Shower Tent, behind which an Army truck full of GIs has just pulled up. While Hawkeye and Duke explain what's going on to Trapper, and the three of them move in for a closer look, we see the visiting GIs drop one by one from the rear of the truck, pay their admission fees and take their places in the line leading up to the strategically placed peep hole in the rear corner of the tent.

The poker table, and dental chair have been removed to make room for two long tables from the Mess Hall. At these a sumptuous, candle-lit, stag banquet is coming to an end. The guests are doctors, administrative officers, chopper pilots and enlisted men. Duke is on his feet, raising a glass of champagne in a toast. (All our male cast except Henry and Frank)
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Y'all come here to say a final goodbye to our old friend Walt. But maybe it ain't so final. Maybe he's just going on ahead into the Unknown to do a little recon job for us all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
During this tribute the guests rise, their eyes on the guest of honor, who sits with his food untouched, a vacant expression on his face. When Duke has finished and everyone has drunk the toast, they applaud and sit down again. Trapper raps for attention and indicates Hawkeye, who rises.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWKEYE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just got this one thing to say. Nobody ordered Walt to take on this mission. He volunteered, for certain death. That's what we award our highest medal for. That's what being a soldier is all about.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWKEYE>
<DIRECTION>
Except for Painless himself, the gathering is deeply moved by this thought, some of them to the point of tears. Again Trapper restores order.
</DIRECTION>
<TRAPPER>

	Only one man here can add anything to that.

</TRAPPER>

He looks to Dago Red, who stands up, dressed for the first time in the priestly vestments he wears for Sunday Mass. He walks to where Painless sits and there begins the viaticum (holy communion for those in danger of death).
</DIRECTION>
<DAGO_RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Receive, my brother, this food for your journey...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAGO_RED>
<DIRECTION>
A coffin, borne into the room by two enlisted men while Red is still speaking, is lined with blankets, equipped with a pillow for comfortable reclining prior to the onset of death, and furnished with momentos of Painless' earthly career: two fresh decks of cards, a box of poker chips, a fifth of scotch, some basic dental instruments and the photographs of his three fiancees. It is set down on the floor next to Painless, who regards it with the first show of interest he has manifested during the proceedings.
</DIRECTION>

He produces and opens a small box, inside which, surrounded by pure white cotton, a black capsule is displayed like a rare jewel. Dago Red, meanwhile, preferring not to know what happens from here on, makes his way out.

	With whiskey. A good swallow first and a big one afterwards. Speeds it into the bloodstream.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
Painless takes the tumbler from him with one hand, the capsule with the other. He downs a good-sized swig of whiskey, then, with the capsule in front of his face, hesitates.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tent has been fixed up with all the resources at their disposal - cushions, parachute cloth, mirrors and little touches of elegance gathered from all over the post - to resemble a luxurious bedroom on the home front. Lying in bed (the pool table) between clean, inviting sheets is Painless. The boys have undressed him as we can see by his bare shoulders. Hawkeye takes Dish by the hand and leads her to the side of the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWKEYE>
	<DIALOGUE>

She finds he's disappeared altogether. She can't resist turning her gaze back to the uncovered Painless. Then she drops the sheet.
</DIRECTION>

The tent flap drops into place, continuing the movement of the sheet. Our attention is drawn up the front of the tent to its peak, which points firmly upwards.

TIME LAPSE:

:SC: EXT. THE SWAMP - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is the SOUND of a HELICOPTER overhead. Hawkeye emerges from the tent to look at it, verifying that it is coming from the peaceful south rather than the embattled north. Then he sees Lieutentant Dish coming out of her tent, wearing her Army uniform and followed by one of the enlisted men carrying her bags. Hawkeye waves goodbye but Dish doesn't see him. Her face, seen up close, has a serene, faraway look, neither happy nor unhappy, but enriched by experience.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hawkeye is not distressed by her failure to acknowledge him; he understands it's a question of preoccupation and not a deliberate snub. He starts across the compound to the Mess Hall, noting that the helicopter is descending to land on the far side of the hospital.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. LANDING AREA OUTSIDE 4077TH MASH - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a small welcoming party on hand, headed by Henry himself, to greet the passenger arriving in the helicopter. When it lands the door is opened and HOT LIPS (as she will soon be known) gets out smartly, which is the way she does everything. Her official name is Major Margaret Houlihan and she is tallish, willowish, blondish, fortyish, prettyish. She and Henry exchange salutes and then shake hands. The others in the greeting party are out of the habit of saluting, and have to be reminded by a stern look from their Commanding Officer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Henry and Hot Lips, followed by the others, head for the hospital entrance, Lieutenant Dish appears with the enlisted man behind her. She gets into the helicopter and he lifts her bags in after her. A moment later the chopper is airborne again.

As Boone dashes off with no comprehension of the errand he is supposed to perform, Trapper, a couple of beds away, in the soiled fatigues he wears on nonoperating room duty, can see and hear what is going on. While he watches, Frank checks the patient further and establishes that he is dead. With a disappointed sigh, he drops the man's lifeless arm and throws the bedcovers back over him up to his neck.

A ghastly look appears on Boone's face. He tries to say something, can't get it out, and bursts into tears instead. Then additionally ashamed of himself for this weakness, he runs out. Frank, deciding not to discipline the boy for the display of unsoldierly conduct, is proceeding about his business when Trapper accosts him.

The locale is established by the presence of military personnel in uniform and the fact that a KOREAN ARMY DOCTOR, with the aid of one assistant, is examining in quick succession a long line of naked young Korean boys. Ho-Jon's turn comes up and we see how perfunctory the process is: a brief overall scrutiny for visible defects, a blood pressure reading, and the application of a stethescope to a few key spots. Ho-Jon looks healthy and the doctor is startled by the unexpected reaction he gets on applying the stethscope to the boy's heart. He turns to check the blood pressure figure which his assistant is about to record on the form he has taken from Ho-Jon. Apparently the pressure is just as out-of-line as the heartbeat, and the doctor feels Ho-Jon is ineligible for military service.

It's a warm spring day in a climate much like the northeastern part of the United States. At first we see nothing but the latrine tent, which is identified by a sign. A couple of small missiles propelled with considerable force strike the canvas, but it is only when they roll back to the ground that we can identify them as golf balls. A closer look at the ground area reveals a dozen other balls scattered around, and then we see two Korean Houseboys appear from protected places on the sides of the tent, looking carefully to make sure there are no more balls coming, and proceed to gather up those on the ground. During this action there is the SOUND of a helicopter landing near the hospital.

:SC: EXT. FIELD BEHIND OFFICERS' LATRINE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The disrepubility in clothes and grooming that has been increasing with each view of the Swampmen has reached an extreme stage in the view we now get of Hawkeye and Trapper. ALong with their soiled fatigue pants, Hawkeye wears a torn, dirty T-shirt of some unlikely color, Trapper a sport shirt that looks as if he had picked it up in Hawaii on the way over and worn it ever since. Both are unshaven. Each has a well-equipped golf bag into which he now replaces the iron club he has been using for the medium-range shots they have been practicing. Taking out drivers, they set tees in the ground and, as the houseboys run up with the balls, Trapper indicates they will be shooting down the longest dimension of the field. After addressing the balls with a few practice swings, they deliver expert drives that are not only in the 250-yard range but fairly straight in the intended direction.

Trapper and Hawkeye, dressed in kimonos, are sitting Japanese style on the floor with Me Lay around a low table. Three girls serve them attentively, doing everything for them except actually feeding them.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. OPERATING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The PFC has been transferred to an operating table without Hawkeye losing his finger pressure on the artery. The clothes have been cut off him, and Ugly John has both blood and anesthetic going into him, the latter through an intratracheal tube. Hawkeye has a scalpel in his left hand and with it he enlarges the wound around his right index finger. Then he tries to slide a Kelly clamp down his finger into the wound to clamp the artery but he can't manage it left-handed. He looks desperately around the OR only to observe that every surgeon and nurse is fully engaged, including Henry and Hot Lips. Ugly John is having a hard time fulfilling his dual function as it is, and can't possibly take on another. Hawkeye tried again with the clamp and fails, and then, to his great relief, there appears within in his peripheral vision as he concentrates his attention on the PFC's neck, a male figure, gowned, capped, masked and gloved. It doesn't matter to Hawkeye which of his colleagues it is; he just tells him what assistance he needs from him.

	Grab this Kelly, ride it down my fingers and we'll have this mother under control.

	What do I do with it Hawk? This is a little out of my line.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAGO_RED>
<HAWKEYE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't recognize you, Red. When you get the clamp all the way down, open it as wide as you can and see if you can close it on the artery.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWKEYE>
<DIRECTION>
Dagor Red obeys these orders cautiously. When he widens the clamp and starts to close it again, he has the satisfying sensation of feeling something substantial, and siezes it vigorously.
</DIRECTION>
<DAGO_RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got ! I got it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAGO_RED>

But what he has grabbed with the clamp is Hawkeye's finger and Hawkeye, by reflex action, pulls it out to where we can see it with the clamp grasping it. The blood starts to spurt again and Hawkeye goes back into the wound, but this time with his left index finger.

Practice at this point is confined to kicking and passing the three footballs at their disposal, and the uniforms still look clean and new. Trapper is a good passer, Hawkeye is a better-than-average receiver, and Duke punts well, but generally speaking, the balls are dropped more often than they are caught, and the overall effect is pretty ragged. Among the other players are Vollmer, Ugly John, Boone, Painless and Judson. On the sidelines watching are Henry, with a whistle tied to a piece of rubber hospital tubing around his neck, and, in uniform, SPEARCHUCKER, a very big, broad-shouldered black man in his early thirties.

Spearchucker has a blanket wrapped over his head and held together at the chin to eliminate the chance of his being recognized as he looks over their opponents, who now file out of their quonset hut. The first notable thing about them is that they number twenty-five as opposed to a total of fifteen in uniform for the Mash team. Second is the even more discouraging fact that two of them, one black and one white are enormous, bigger than Spearchucker. The uniforms are orange and black.

Duke accordingly kicks the ball about thirty yards and angled to his left. But the player who takes it on the thirty-yard line simply runs to his left and back a little toward his own goal line in order to hand it to the RAM HALFBACK as he charges downfield from his safety position. He sidesteps, stright-arms or otherwise eludes all eleven of the Mash players and runs unimpeded for a touchdown. A few moments later he kicks the ball over the bar for the point after touchdown.

Duke is the one to receive the kickoff, which he takes on the ten. He runs it back about twenty yards, dodging several enemy tacklers, then sees the black tackle from Cleveland bearing down on him. Duke runs back and forth sideways a few times, not gaining any ground but making the other man move.

They are near the sideline to their left, playing a winged T formation. Trapper takes the ball from Vollmer, the center, runs back as if to pass but really gives it to Hawkeye at left half as Hawkeye goes by him in a wide sweep that takes him all the way to the right sideline with the two Cleveland tackles in pursuit. Hawkeye then cuts in quick and tries to get by them but one of them brings him down for a gain of no more than two yards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the next play Trapper really goes back to pass, but his blockers are of no use against the pro tackles, whome he sees descending on him. Trapper starts running straight back for a while, then makes a dash to the right followed by a dash to the left. He is almost tackled again, and his only route of escape is back toward his own goal line.

Faced with a loss of about twenty-five yards, Trapper spots Hawkeye in the area of the line of scrimmage and whips the ball to him. Hawkeye catches it but there are tacklers all around him and he goes down almost immediately for no gain on the play. Moving faster than they have to in order not to give the opposition any rest, the team huddles.

</TRAPPER>
<DIRECTION>
They go into action again. This time Trapper, taking the ball from Vollmer, gives it to Duke, who makes a feint at an off-tackle play, then turns back and into a wide end run instead. Duke is still a good ball carrier by college standards and he has little trouble shaking off the amateurs who try to tackle him, and is thus able to make it a running duel with the professionals. When they finally nab him, he is no more than two or three yards ahead of the scrimmage line, but the ex-tackles from Cleveland are visibly panting and wishing they hadn't allowed all that extra poudage to accumulate. On the fourth down, of course, they have to punt. Duke goes back to receive the ball from Vollmer at center.

<DIRECTION>
He does a good job of it. The kick is high enough so there are several red jerseys around the Ram halfback when he gets under it. He raises his right arm for a fair catch. The would-be Mash tacklers, including Hawkeye and Trapper are frustrated. They array themselves defensively while their opponents have a huddle and line up to take the offense.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWKEYE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's get him this time. I don't think they've got anyone else who can carry the ball.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWKEYE>
<DIRECTION>
As Hawkeye anticipated, the opposing quarterback slips the ball to the Ram halfback, who starts to go wide of the tackle, sees Hawkeye, untouched by blockers, closing in from the outside, and makes his beautiful cross-over to cut back in. At the same time he is hit at the knees by Hawkeye, and high by Duke. And there are quite a few other Mash players in the immediate vicinity, Trapper and Ugly John in the forefront, so that a lot of weight is piled up on top of the flashy halfback.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A close look at Ugly John reveals him to be reaching inside his jersey and under a shoulder pad, from which he extracts a hypodermic needle. With the skill of an expert anesthesiologist he pulls up the sleeve of the tackled and stunned halfback, and plunges the needle into his arm.

The Mash players quickly remove themselves. Duke and Hawkeye are the last to get up. Remaining on the ground is the former halfback for the Rams, still firmly clutching the ball but looking as if he needed to get a lot of air into his lungs. His captain, the white pro tackle, takes one look at him and speaks to the Referee.

Radar also appears from the opposite sideline with water for his team. Ugly John takes advantage of his presence to slip the hypodermic he has been concealing in his hand into Radar's pocket.
</DIRECTION>

Meanwhile there is agreement in the opposition camp that the Ram halfback should go out of the game for a while to rest up. A couple of his teammates assist him to the bench. The Mash players observe this.

<DIRECTION>
The two teams have taken the field again. Hawkeye has switched to left end, Spearchucker replacing him in the backfield. This time General Hammond's men are kicking off to Henry's. It's a long kick but it doesn't go toward the center of the goal line, where Spearchucker is waiting for it, but to Duke, who runs toward Spearchucker and tosses him an easy lateral.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two pro tackles from the Browns run down the field so as to converge on Spearchucker around the Mash twenty-five. But the other Mash players divide themselves into equal units of five to do nothing but take out the two tackles. The other opposing players are no problem for Spearchucker, who runs around or right through them, and crosses their goal line for a touchdown. The ball is brought out for the extra point which Duke scores with a place kick. Before the teams reassamble for the next kickoff, the captain of the 325th team detours a few yards toward his bench and calls something to General Hammond, whose reaction is to stand up and shake his fist in Henry's direction.

Spearchucker is trying to block or intercept a forward pass, but the two tackles from Cleveland still have enough strength left to put him out of action with their combined efforts.

The Referee blows the whistle and the two teams line up to resume action. The 325th Evac quarterback drops back as if to pass, his left end starts to his right, and the whole Mash eleven starts to their left. Only Ugly John finds himself temporarily buried under a 265-pound tackle. The other ten men in red meet the enemy left end after he takes the ball off the quarterback's hand, and they bring him down for a loss. The opposing team goes into another huddle but their strategy remains as Radar overheard it. When the left halfback starts to his right, the Mash players start to their right, and after the right halfback takes over possession and tries to turn in, he finds himself hopelessly outnumbered. Spearchucker hits him first with a tackle so fierce it throws him back five yards and induces him to fumble the ball. A pile of half a dozen Mash players pounces on it, causing some damage to each other.

<DIRECTION>
They break out of the huddle and line up as directed, with all the linemen except Hawkeye on Vollmer's right. Their opponents have trouble adjusting to this and are even more confused when, just as Trapper bends down to take the ball from Vollmer, Hawkeye steps back into the backfield and Duke squeezes into the already crowded right line. Returning the ball to Vollmer, Trapper turns his back, fakes a pitchout to Spearchucker, who is racing toward the line, and continues backward, holding himself as if he still had the ball and were fading for a long pass. So successfully does he create this impression that the two tackles from Cleveland, seeing clearly that Spearchucker hasn't received the ball, descend on Trapper with their last burst of energy. Two other orange-and-black linemen also fall on top of him. Meanwhile, Vollmer, holding his arms crossed under his stomach to further hide the ball, and looking as if her were suffering from a painful blow beneath the belt, starts walking down the field at an angle toward his own sideline, making the opposition think he is heading for the bench to seek relief from his injury. Spearchucker stops running at about the enemy thirty, looks back to where Trapper's tacklers are beginning to remove themselves, but also notes out of the corner of his eye that only the opposing safety man is anywhere near Vollmer and that he isn't paying much attention to him.

Vollmer begins to run straight toward the goal line, which has the unfortunate effect of alerting the safety man to what is happening. He races across the field to cut Vollmer off. Spearchucker starts into motion at the same instant and gets down there so fast that just as the safety man is tackling Vollmer in a way that would throw him out of bounds on the two-yard line, Spearchucker hurls himself against the safety man with a strong and well-aimed block that sends both men across the goal line.

All he gets in response are funny looks and laughter. By the time he comes near where Hawkeye and Duke are standing, the Sergeant is beginning to wonder if there is something peculiar about the names he is calling. For added protection Hawkeye and Duke have replaced their Medical Corps insignia with the simple cross of the Chaplain's Corps.

	Glad to know you. Listen, we're ducking short-arm inspection but our cover isn't going to last long. How would you two boys like to do us a favor? Be Forrest and Pierce of the Medical Corps between here and Seattle.

	<DIALOGUE>
	We wouldn't know how to go about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIGNAL_CORPS_CAPTAIN>
<HAWKEYE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing to it. You just turn a chair around backwards and rest your chin on the top. You sit there with a big cigar in your mouth and and every now and then, just to show you're looking, you say, 'Don't wave it so close to my cigar, soldier.' That's all you do. You can't go wrong.
