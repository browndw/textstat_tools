Yeah, a decade ago, Halloween night he murdered 16 people, maybe more-trying to get to his sister. Nearly got her too. But his doctor, of all people, shot him six times. Then he set him on fire. Both of them nearly burned to death. Yeah, I'll be glad to see this one gone. Oh yes in deedie.

	I'd assumed Dr. Loomis would be here. Michael Myers was his patient.

</MAN>
<DR_HOFFMAN>

JAMIE LLOYD, Laurie's nine year old daughter, sits on the couch, staring out the window. An ambulance sits outside. Jamie is very pretty with dark hair. SUNDAY, the family dog, sits next to her. RACHEL, the Corruthers' only daughter, comes into the living room. She's about 16, 17. Her blond hair falls around her shoulders. She sits down next to Jamie.

<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're not real sisters Jamie, but that doesn't mean I love you any less.

Jamie looks out the window and sees that the ambulance is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sleep tight. We'll have French toast for breakfast, okay? Come on Sunday. Night night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
She leaves, closing the door behind her. The window is open, band wind blows inside, chilling the room. Jamie walks over to close it, and as she does, she passes her vanity, with a large mirror in the center surrounded by two mirrors on both sides. Thunder lights up the room, and Michael, mask in place, is seen in the mirror. Jamie doesn't notice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jamie closes the window and looks around. She walks to the closet and opens it. She sits on the floor and picks up a box. She takes off the lid and goes through the various pictures inside. She comes to a picture and pulls it out. It's a picture of Laurie holding a pumpkin, smiling. Jamie begins to cry. Thunder rumbles outside. Jamie puts the picture back in the box and closes the closet door. She walks over to her bed and gets on her knees, about to pray.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, I lay me down to sleep I pray the lord my soul to keep, if I should die before I wake I pray the lord my soul to take. God bless Mr. and Mrs. Corruthers. God bless Rachel, God Bless Sunday, god bless me. And god bless Mommy and Daddy in heaven. Amen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
She's about to crawl into bed when the closet door creaks open. Strange. Jamie slowly stands up and walks over to the closet. She grabs the door and opens it. On the floor is her doll. She picks it up and sets it on a shelf. Jamie turns, but a creak noise behind her grabs her attention. She looks back into the closet, but of course nothing is there. She stands for a minute, her mind in overdrive. She dismisses the noise and closes the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She walks to her bed as thunder rumbles in the distance. Again, the closet door creaks open. Jamie just stands there. Why is the door opening? She slowly heads towards the closet, her eyes roaming the room. Suddenly, a hand snakes out from under the bed and grabs Jamie! She screams ans falls to the floor. Her tiny hands flail about on the floor, trying to find a handhold. She kicks and gets her foot free. She races towards the door. At the bed, a figure sits up and turns to face us, even though he is bathed in darkness. Lighting cracks outside, and the room is illuminated. It's Michael! Jamie screams and runs to her door, but it won't open.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help! Help me, please!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
Michael stands up. He has a knife in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help me! Somebody help me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
She finally gets the door open, only to reveal... MICHAEL, knife high in the air, prepared to strike. Jamie screams and backs up in fear as Michael advances.
</DIRECTION>

Rachel reaches the very top of the roof. She tries to reach for the arched part of the roof, but misses. She tries again, but still doesn't make it.

Rachel continues to lower Jamie when Michael suddenly appears! She lets go of the cable, making Jamie drop about halfway down. Rachel rolls out of the way as Michael takes a swipe at her with his knife. He places his hand on the chimney for support. He again takes a swipe at Rachel, causing her to roll to the edge of the roof.
</DIRECTION>

Michael slowly heads for her. Rachel dangles above the ground, her hands holding onto the roof for dear life. She starts to slowly move to the side, away from Michael.

Jamie jumps to the ground just as Michael gets to his feet. Meeker pulls the trigger on his shotgun and BAM! a bullet hits Michael dead on. He's knocked back. The other cops and hillbillies open fire, creating a dazzling display of light. Bullet after bullet slams into Michael, causing him to step back. A few bullets hit the ground around Michael, but most hit home. Rachel covers her ears as the sounds of bullets being fired echoes all around her. Meeker takes aim, and fires, his bullet knocking Michael back. More and more bullets rain down on Michael, causing one of the most terrifying killers ever to stumble backwards, until he slips and falls down an abandoned mine shaft, hopefully to his death.

The guns go quiet as everybody realizes that Michael is gone. Meeker breaths deeply, satisfied. No human could have survived that onslaught of bullets. No one. Wood and dirt crumble into the mine, burying Michael.
