PAUL (50's) stands on the street under a RAISED TRAIN BRIDGE. He covers his ears in UTTER DISGUST at the UNBEARABLE NOISE a train makes as it ROARS OVERHEAD.

As the train moves on he walks, slowly, DESPONDENT. Lost in a private WORLD OF PAIN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind him we see a woman in a fur collard coat and flowered hat walking, gaining on him. This is JEANNE (20's).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she PASSES Paul, she turns to GLANCE at him. We read a HINT of EMPATHY on her face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is OBLIVIOUS to her or anything else for that matter.

She walks on, dodging STREET SWEEPERS as she covers the long walkway, trying to forget the SAD MAN she saw.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see her walk toward a 6 story APARTMENT BUILDING.

Paul, with TEARS STREAMING DOWN HIS FACE, comes to reality as he also notices the building. He REGARDS it.

	Yeah. Some. There was a farmer, a very nice guy. Old guy, very poor, and worked real hard. I used to work in a ditch, draining land for farming. And he wore overalls and he smoked a clay pipe. Half the time he wouldn't put tobacco in it. And I hated the work. It was hot and dirty and... it broke my back. And... all day long I'd watch his spit which would run down the pipe stem and hang on the bowl of the pipe. And I used to make bets with myself on when it was going to fall off. And I always lost. I never saw it fall off. I'd just look around and it'd be gone and then the new one would be there. And then we had a beautiful... My mother... My mother taught me to love nature. And... I guess that was the most she could do. And... we had... In front of our house we had this big field... meadow. It was a mustard field in the summer and we had a big black dog named Dutchy. And she used to hunt for rabbits in that field but she couldn't see them. So she'd have to leap up in this mustard field and look around very quickly to see where the rabbits were. And it was... very beautiful. And she never caught the rabbits.

	No. They're all about young couples. Before marriage, no children. Then the same couple, married with children. In short, marriage. The perfect, ideal, successful marriage. It's no longer the preserve of the Church. The husband was burdened with responsibilities and the wife nagged. Now, weddings in advertising smile!

Even if the husband lives fucking years, he's never going to be able to discover his wife's real nature. I mean, I... I might be able to comprehend the universe, but... 'll never discover the truth bout you. Never. I mean, who the hell were you? Remember that day, the first day I was there? I knew that I couldn't get into your pants unless I said... What did I say? Oh, yeah. "May I have my bill, please? I have to leave." Remember? Last night... I ripped off the lights on your mother. And the whole joint went bananas. All your... guests... as you used to call them... Well, I guess that includes me, doesn't it? It does include me, doesn't it? For five years, I was more a guest in this fucking flophouse than a husband. With privileges, of course. And then, to help me understand you, you let me inherit Marcel. The husband's double, whose room was the double of ours. And you know what? I didn't even have the guts to ask him. Didn't have the guts to ask him if the same numbers you and I did were the same numbers you did with him. Our marriage was nothing more than a foxhole for you. And all it took for you to get out was a -cent razor and a tub full of water. You cheap, goddamn, fucking, godforsaken whore. I hope you rot in hell. You're worse than the dirtiest street pig anybody could find, and you know why? You know why? Because you lied. You lied to me and I trusted you. You lied. You knew you were lying!

	But you know, what the hell. I'm... no prize. I picked up a nail when I was in Cuba in and now I got a prostate like an Idaho potato. But I'm still a good stick man, even if I can't have any children. Let's see. I don't have any stomping grounds. I don't have any friends. I suppose if I hadn't met you, I'd probably settle for a hard chair and a hemorrhoid. Anyway, to make a long, dull story even duller, I come from a time when a guy like me would drop into a joint like this and pick up a young chick like you and... and call her a bimbo.

She is RUNNING on the sidewalk past crowds of people, the OFFICE OF TOURISM and stores. He is in HOT PURSUIT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stops and turns to have a EMPHATIC SILENT CHAT with him. He still finds this to be VERY HUMOROUS. She grows more and more SERIOUS and SCARED.

She starts RUNNING again. But she TIRES OUT in a ...

He tries to REASON with her.

</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
She sees her chance to get back in her moms. She dashes over and UNLOCKS THE DOOR and flies inside trying to slam the door shut. It's no use, he FORCES HIS WAY IN.
</DIRECTION>

She HUSTLES to the DRAWER with her FATHERS GUN... Paul is still at the FRONT DOOR.

He PLAYS ON.

HE IS SHOCKED BY THE FORCE OF THE BULLET INTO HIS GUT.

The color DRAINS FROM HIS FACE, his eyes get WOOZY...

<DIRECTION>
He can only MUTTER.

<DIRECTION>
He opens the FRENCH DOORS and STAGGERS onto the PORCH.

<DIRECTION>
PORCH - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He LOOKS OUT upon the city, and UP TO THE SKY. He takes his gum out of his mouth and STICKS IT UNDER THE RAILING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes register his BEWILDERMENT as he STARES out into the ROOF TOPS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see that he is DEAD -- curled in a FETAL POSITION.

SAD MUSIC RISES

She mutters to herself the ALIBI FOR THE POLICE.

DIALOGUE IS FRENCH
