BIRDS ARE FLUSHED FROM HIDING. A soldier carrying an automatic weapon rises up out of the grass and looks around. A mortar shell explodes nearby. There are no sound effects. He seems unperturbed.

INT./EXT. LOBBY OF THE 'NEW PEOPLE'S HOTEL' - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A door slams o.s. and the figure of RUSSELL PRICE, 30, appears at the top of some stairs. Sleepy-eyed, he pulls on a multi- pocketed fishing vest over a baggy shirt. He carries a beat up canvas bag over his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BLACK WOMAN, 40, sleeps at the lobby switchboard desk. Another OLD BLACK MAN sweeps the floor. Price mumbles a 'good morning' and goes to two vintage WW II vending machines -- one for candy, one for Coca-Cola. He buys two candy bars and a coke, and begins eating his "breakfast" as he crosses the lobby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE HOTEL - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JIMMY, a cab driver, has been sleeping in a chair against the wall. Several street vendors have their wares laid out on the sidewalk against the hotel. Some are shaded by makeshift awnings, some are not. Jimmy rises as Price arrives; there is familiar ritual in their greeting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They cross the street together toward Jimmy's waiting taxi, a hand-painted purple old American car with the words on the door, "New People's Taxi Company" and Jimmy's name in script above it. Price hands a candy bar to Jimmy.

EXT. A REMOTE AFRICAN VILLAGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The taxi arrives, and Price gets out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Price ambles over to stand in the early morning shade against an old building. A hand-painted image of Che Guevarra -- with an X painted over it -- is on one wall. Price pulls a joint from his pocket and lights up, taking a hit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sounds of war machinery soon interrupt the stillness. Price hurries to the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
P.O.V. A JEEP LEADING AN ARMY CONVOY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Price pulls a handful of colored rags from his pocket and picks out a yellow kerchief, tying it to his arm. Price then steps boldly into the street in front of the approaching convoy. He exchanges shouts with an officer in a jeep, and with a motion is given permission to join.
</DIRECTION>

PRICE CLIMBS INTO THE LAST OF THREE TROOP TRUCKS

Each truck is filled with perhaps 25 African soldiers in khaki, each holding an automatic rifle. Another jeep follows, towing a World War II cannon.

The soldiers look over disinterestedly. Two dozen cases of Coca-Cola are tied to a stretcher among stacks of guns.

As Price settles in for the ride, he begins pulling cameras from his bag. Quickly and automatically, rarely looking, he switches lenses, loads film, and prepares his cameras. He has done this a thousand times.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SINGLE WHITE SOLDIER -- OATES, rises from among the blacks, and shakily makes his way toward Price. A mercenary dressed in a ragged uniform of his own design, carries two machine guns and a .45. He smiles broadly, recognizing Price. HODGE slaps Price's hands as if they were teammates.

As he speaks, the cab of the truck is rocked with a mortar shell and explodes. Soldiers scramble to safety. Some grab the guns being transported.

TWO SOLDIERS GRAB THE STRETCHER OF COKE and start running for safety. Smoke and explosions are everywhere -- they abandon their cargo and run for cover.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OATES SCRAMBLES TO SAFE GROUND quickly and instinctively, looking around wildly to "read" the situation. Price dives next to him.

A SOLDIER IS HIT AND GOES DOWN NEARBY, staggering towards Price and Oates.

A DC-3 GOES UP IN FLAMES IN THE BACKGROUND

THE WOUNDED SOLDIER REACHES FOR OATES who darts out quickly and drags the injured Rebel to safety.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PRICE HAS HIS CAMERAS OUT AT ONCE and is firing away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO REBEL SOLDIERS POINT TO THE STRETCHER OF COCA-COLA and start moving toward it through the smoke. They want to rescue the soft drinks.

PRICE LEAPS FROM HIS BUNKER AND RACES TOWARD THEM dangerously, waving and shouting as he does.

P.O.V. THE FRAMED IMAGE -- SOLDIERS, SMOKE AND COKE IN B.G. As the soldiers move toward the Coke, Price snaps picture after picture.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MORTAR EXPLOSION BLOWS THE COCA-COLA TO A MILLION BITS The two soldiers stop short -- several more steps and they would have been killed. Price's intrusion has accidentally saved them. The two soldiers run toward safety, bewildered and scared.

ON THE AIRFIELD - THE SMOKE CLEARS AND ALL IS CALM

Gradually the airfield comes back to life. Several teams of medics run with stretchers from the hut and begin gathering bodies. Rebel soldiers appear from every conceivable shelter and move across the field.

Oates emerges and meets Price on the torn up runway amidst the rubble. They look around at the devastation.

Suddenly, the distant roar of a jet. All the soldiers on the field scan the horizon; Price looks up. The air raid siren goes off.

A JET DIVES OUT OF THE SKY TOWARD THE AIRFIELD OATES AND THE SOLDIERS DIVE TO COVER

JET STREAKS OVERHEAD and, instead of rockets and bombs, it drops something else:

THE SKY IS FILLED WITH A MILLION PIECES OF PAPER The jet pulls out and disappears. All is quiet again as the million papers flutter in the sky above the airfield.

Out of frustration a single soldier fires a couple of shots at the paper.

Price grabs a piece of paper out of the air. It is:

Price reacts strongly, flaring slightly and withdrawing.

He doesn't respond. They stand for several moments -- the sounds of the party get louder. She turns and heads to Alex's celebration, leaving Price alone in the darkroom.

EXT. THE STREETS OF MANAGUA - THE CAPITOL - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON: TIME MAGAZINE WITH COVER PHOTO OF THE ELEPHANTS, gradually PULL BACK to reveal other magazines, candy, cigars, Nicaraguan toys, all in a corner shop, and finally:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FIRE TRUCK LEADS A PROCESSION through the streets -- a group of middle class Nicaraguan women carry a banner that reads "Our Revolution is in Christ" (in Spanish), followed by three Catholic PRIESTS in bright robes, followed by a sound truck with P.A. system, followed by hundreds of townspeople carrying banana leaves and religious signs. All are singing a Catholic hymn in a swaying, hypnotic rhythm. Small red and black flags are scattered throughout.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CAB DRIVING THROUGH THE STREETS runs into the parade and stops. Price sits in the front seat -- his luggage is tied precariously to the roof. The trunk of the cab has been smashed in beyond repair. Price hops out of the cab with his camera bag -- he doesn't know what the parade is about but it looks great. He hands the cabbie some money to stay nearby.
</DIRECTION>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRICE>
<DIRECTION>
He runs to join the procession.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PRICE HOPS ONTO THE RUNNING BOARD OF THE FIRE TRUCK and almost simultaneously his light meter is out. HE is surrounded by images: SMALL GIRLS DRESSED AS ANGELS LINE THE STREET, TOWNSPEOPLE HANG FROM DOORWAYS AND WINDOWS, ICE CREAM CARTS AMONG RELIGIOUS ICONS, SOLDIERS WITH GUNS STAND IN SMALL GROUPS ALONG THE PARADE ROUTE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PRICE IS QUICKLY TAKING PICTURES OF EVERYTHING, changing cameras, occasionally taking a quick light reading; his actions are instinctive and automatic. Suddenly:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TEN YOUNG TEENAGERS BURST INTO THE PARADE They wear red and black handkerchiefs, baseball caps, and strange masks. They are chanting:
</DIRECTION>
<TEENAGE_BOYS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rafael, Rafael, Rafael... libre o muerte... Rafael...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TEENAGE_BOYS>
<DIRECTION>
A LARGE PAINTING OF THE FACE OF RAFAEL is carried aloft on a stick, draped with red and black scarves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PRICE PHOTOGRAPHS the boys and the painting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NATIONAL GUARD SOLDIERS SHOVE INTO THE PARADE Up and down the street they spring into action, running for position with their guns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An ice cream vendor is knocked down, a mother clutches her "angel" daughter, another child is whisked inside a door as the Soldiers break into the procession.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE "MUCHACHOS" WITH RAFAEL TURN TO RUN but realize that the soldiers have cut off their escape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THREE SOLDIERS BREAK into the parade and are separated from the boys only by a group of Priests. Trapped, the boys panic, but as the SOLDIERS push towards them:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE PRIESTS BLOCK THE SOLDIERS and intentionally scuffle with them, allowing the boys just enough time to dart into a house. One of the boys drops the picture of Rafael as he heads in the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CROWD PUSHES FORWARD, the route to the door is blocked off, and the boys escape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOLDIERS FIND THE PORTRAIT OF RAFAEL and shoot it full of holes with their automatic weapons.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PRICE PHOTOGRAPHS "RAFAEL" as his image is ripped to shreds with bullets.

The singing and the parade march on.

Overlooking Managua is a sub-tropical paradise that seems far removed from a brutal civil war, this one time tourist watering hole serves as home base to the international press.

PRICE SEES ALEX and sneaks over to drop the Time magazine over his shoulder onto the table in front of him. Without looking up, Alex knows Price has arrived. He smiles.

</PRICE>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... I thought of calling your photographs "Pictures from a Lost War"... I'm great at captions -- the New York editors loved it since none of them knew where the hell Chad was anyway -- it legitimized their ignorance, got you a cover, me a feature, and packaged a class struggle in two words. Nifty, eh?

IN THE BACKGROUND CLAIRE WALKS INTO THE POOL-BAR AREA She carries her handbag and some papers -- she stops short seeing Price sitting with Alex. She hesitates, starts toward them, stops, and sits down at the bar at the opposite end of the pool.
</DIRECTION>

Price sees her, and she sees Price. They pretend they don't. Price turns to Isela and launches into a stream of broken, chauvinistic Spanish with his usual elegance.

Isela seems to welcome the question. Her tone is less flip, and she focuses hard on Price.

ANOTHER MASKED FACE COMES OUT OF THE KITCHEN The dishwasher waves a gun.

<DIRECTION>
TWO MASKED FACES -- THE COUPLE -- ENTER THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR The woman carries an automatic rifle and guards the entrance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THREE MASKED FACES APPEAR Almost materialize from thin air, moving silently and without commotion. The music winds down slowly. (Six Guerrillas total)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A GUERRILLA QUICKLY SPRAYS AN IMAGE ON THE WALL With a few deftly drawn strokes, the FACE OF RAFAEL magically appears. The name "RAFAEL" is written under the face, then other names and revolutionary slogans. As this takes place:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A WOMAN GUERRILLA HAS A GUN AT THE HEAD OF A NICARAGUAN BUSINESSMAN The middle-aged, well-dressed local sits with his wife and two other men. They freeze in fear, the nightclub freezes, as the GUERRILLAS take control of the room swiftly and smoothly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ONE GUERRILLA FACES THE NICARAGUAN BUSINESSMAN at the table and speaks loudly but without panic. The masked Guerrillas around the room are serious but nervous.
</DIRECTION>

The BUSINESSMAN refuses. The GUERRILLA LEADER takes a hand grenade from his pocket and pulls the pin without hesitation, then holds the grenade in front of him fearlessly, inches away from the Businessman's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Businessman rises slowly. The LEADER motions toward the back door of the club.

The woman with the gun shoves it into the man's head forcing him to move toward the kitchen door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PRICE TAKES PICTURES QUICKLY WITH A TINY CAMERA that fits into the palm of his hand. Neatly, surreptitiously, and calmly -- Price is coolest in any crisis.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLAIRE PUNCHES ON HER TINY TAPE RECORDER instinctively, and a tiny red light comes on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BUSINESSMAN IS SHOVED TO THE DOOR He hesitates, afraid to leave the room. The Guerrilla shoves the grenade in his face; the woman sticks the gun into his neck even deeper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MASKED GUERRILLA AT THE FRONT DOOR SHOUTS FOR THEM TO HURRY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BANDMEMBERS -- INCLUDING ALEX -- BACK AWAY FROM THE BANDSTAND Alex trips over the drum set slightly -- a clanging clash of cymbals startles everyone, and as the drama freezes:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE KITCHEN DOOR SWINGS OPEN, AND THE BOY PHOTOGRAPHER EMERGES Innocently, the young boy struts out of the kitchen to see what's going on, and as he does the DOOR STRIKES THE ARM OF THE GUERRILLA WITH THE GRENADE, and:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE GRENADE IS KNOCKED FREE For an instant, everything freezes, and:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE GRENADE ROLLS ACROSS THE FLOOR Daisy Williams, the singer, runs away screaming as the grenade comes to rest near a crowded section of the club.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Guerrilla guarding the side door rushes for it, picks it up, and as he does:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE GRENADE EXPLODES IN THE GUERRILLA'S HAND A brutal explosion -- the ceiling caves in partially, the musical instruments explode, and:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SANDINISTA GUERRILLAS DART FROM THE ROOM through various doors. The boy photographer lies bloodied. The Guerrilla who picked up the grenade is a barely recognizable corpse. The Businessman is soiled but unhurt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ONE HALF OF THE CLUB BREAKS OUT IN FLAME As a broken gas pipe feeds a sudden outburst of fire, the club's patrons panic -- screaming and shoving towards the door as the ROOM LIGHTS UP, and:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PRICE'S LIGHT METER IS OUT AT ONCE followed quickly by a 35mm camera, quickly clicking off picture after picture of the club amid the flames and panic. The new light makes his job easier.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PRICE TAKES A LIGHT READING near the body of the boy photographer. He sees the boy's camera lying nearby. Price puts away his light meter and feels the boy's pulse, then puts his ear to the boy's heart -- making sure he is not still alive.

CLAIRE TEARS A STORY OFF THE TELEX while Price stands to the side of the action eating a sandwich and watching.

ALEX STANDS AT THE CENTER OF IT ALL Established as the senior figure (or one of them) to whom other, younger journalists come for information.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A YOUNG JOURNALIST, a Time stringer, is slightly distraught on the phone, and interrupts Alex's dealing with others, cupping the phone, to announce:
</DIRECTION>

While Charlie argues on the other end of the phone, Alex initials papers and performs several jobs at once.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like hell I'm editorializing, the whole thing happened in a roomful of C.I.A. and press. What do you want?!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

</ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
HUB KITTLE has been floating through the room and, upon hearing the word "fascist," takes offense and approaches Alex.

<HUB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! There's fascists and then there's fascists, right? Be careful how you throw words like that around.
	</DIALOGUE>

Alex ignores Hub though he is slightly pestered by him, and continues on the phone as he initials papers brought to him.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We don't have any pictures of Rafael because nobody knows where the son of a bitch is, and anybody crazy enough to go after him...

Alex spots Price who is standing nearby, still eating a sandwich, still enjoying the high energy buzz of the room. Alex directs his next line so that Price cannot fail to get the message. Alex plays the moment coolly.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>

EXT. MANAGUAN STREET NEAR THE HOTEL - LATER THAT NIGHT

Price bounces along, whistling, "San Francisco." An occasional Guardia jeep or taxi rumbles past. He strolls up the walkway of a house from which comes a strange, blue glow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE MONEYCHANGERS HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blue walls, bare bulbs, several pictures on the wall, and an old woman lying in a hammock. Music in the b.g. Price approaches her and hands her a $100 bill -- there is a brief negotiation of the black market value.

PICTURE OF ANASTAZIO SOMOZA IN WHITE, PICTURE OF THE VIRGIN OF GUADALUPE, PICTURE OF SANTA CLAUS, FADED NEWSPHOTO OF HANK AARON HITTING HIS 715TH HOME RUN.

PRICE SMILES AND TURNS RIGHT INTO A SHARP BAYONET mounted to a rifle held threateningly by a Guardia soldier.

THE SMALL ROOM IS FILLED WITH NATIONAL GUARDS We haven't heard them enter over the sounds of music and our preoccupation with the pictures.
</DIRECTION>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is this? I'm a journalist!

No answer. Price pulls a thick passport and press credentials from a pocket, handing them to the Officer in charge.
</DIRECTION>
<PRICE>

<DIRECTION>
The officer looks at Price's passport photo, studies it briefly and takes the passport. He nods.

A rifle butt is jammed violently into Price's belly -- he doubles over. The Officer nods, and Price is led away.

INT. A BRIGHTLY LIT ROOM

<DIRECTION>
Price is led into a lineup of 10 people, all Nicaraguans. The room is narrow and so brightly lit that at first he covers his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FIGURES MOVE IN THE SHADOWS A Guardia soldier moves up and down the lineup, stopping to point at a prisoner. In the line we recognize the WAITER from the Viking Club. Price speaks to the soldier in a calm, reasoned tone.
</DIRECTION>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mi amigo -- mala interpretacion, eh? Periodista, comprende? Famoso. Time magazine.

</DIRECTION>
<SOLDIER>
<DIRECTION>
(in Spanish)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLDIER>
<DIRECTION>
Price holds up his hands -- he may be fearless, but he's not stupid. The soldier pulls a knife, then pulls his own tongue from his mouth, and makes motions with the knife as if cutting out his tongue. The message is clear -- Price doesn't speak.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The soldier walks up to the Waiter and points. The Waiter is frightened.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the shadows we see an officer talking with a civilian in a hat. The civilian points to a door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE WAITER IS LED AWAY THROUGH A DOOR protesting desperately as he goes. The soldier moves to the next prisoner -- he too is led away. This repeats itself until the soldier arrives at price.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SOLDIER POINTS TO PRICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PRICE'S P.O.V. THROUGH THE SHADOWS The civilian is in a discussion with the officer -- it is clear that his opinion affects the decisions. For a moment Price doesn't know where he's going to be led. The civilian points to a different door -- it opens -- and Price steps down off the display rack into a room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THROUGH THE DOOR as Price steps through, the action continues with the other Nicaraguan prisoners. Price looks around quickly, but the Civilian and Officer are gone. He is quickly shown into a bare office.

Jazy motions for Claire and Price to follow him inside.

INT. JAZY'S HOUSE - DAY

The pool is visible in b.g. His house, like the pool, is rumpled and slightly sloppy though it betrays the taste of its occupant -- books everywhere, pictures on the wall, nothing cheap or tacky but everything is well worn.

AN INTERSECTION HELD BY LA GUARDIA TROOPS WITH A TANQUETTA Price and Claire duck into a doorway, protected in effect by the Government soldiers who wait silently, guns ready, around the corner of a building. We see what they're waiting for.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A YOUNG SANDINISTA COMES OUT OF A BUILDING a block away, holding a handgun. Momentarily confused, he begins running toward us, toward the soldiers waiting in ambush. The Guerrilla races quickly to his waiting death, and as he turns the corner right into a dozen Guardia troops:

THE GUARDIA GUNS OPEN UP ON THE YOUNG GUERRILLA, killing him instantly.

CLAIRE TURNS HER HEAD AWAY unable to watch.

PRICE AND CLAIRE MOVE DOWN A SIDESTREET SLOWLY as:

SEVERAL GUERRILLA MUCHACHOS DART OUT OF AN ALLEY with sharpened sticks, a spear gun, and one home-made gun. The Muchachos hesitate briefly, lost, and see Price.

THE MUCHACHOS QUICKLY POSE FOR A PICTURE motioning for Price to record them. They pose instantly in "tough-guy" posture.

For a moment they aren't sure what this means -- are they in trouble? The Sandinistas shove past the two journalists, pushing open a doorway and disappearing inside. For a moment Price and Claire are alone on the street.

A family huddles in the corner as the MAN OF THE HOUSE pulls back a couch and a hanging blanket, revealing another hole knocked in the wall. The Sandinistas, Pedro, Claire and Price scramble through.

INT. THE KITCHEN OF A TINY SIDEWALK RESTAURANT - DAY

The Three Sandinistas, Pedro, Claire, and Price emerge. A WOMAN, 50, runs the cafe and welcomes them. The SIX crawl so as not to be seen from the street; they stop long enough to survey the plaza.

P.O.V. THE CENTRAL PLAZA OF LEON DOMINATED BY A HUGE CATHEDRAL Half a dozen bodies are scattered across the plaza. Otherwise, it is empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
P.O.V. SIX GUARDIA SNIPERS IN THE CHURCH TOWER control the plaza. As we watch, they fire off occasional shots in different directions--there is no way to cross the plaza.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE WOMAN PULLS A TRAY OF "CONTACT BOMBS" from the oven, home-made grenades that look like muffins on a tray. Pedro grabs one and pretends to bite into it. The Sandinistas start to laugh and catch themselves as Pedro clowns. Claire and Price aren't sure what the "muffins" are and don't respond; mostly they are on edge. The contact bombs are put in a sack.

INT. THE CATHEDRAL - DAY

A tapestry rug is pulled away, and Pedro's head appears. He climbs out and soon all the party is in the church. A PRIEST leads them quickly through an immense, nearly. European interior of ornate altars and burning candles. The small party is led to a small corner of the sanctuary where a long, rickety ladder leads up to the roof.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SANDINISTAS SCRAMBLE UP THE LADDER as it sways. Pedro follows with his sack of contact bombs. Then Price goes up as the Priest holds the ladder. The American is much larger than the Nicaraguans -- the ladder squeaks and sways, and when he is nearly at the top:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE LADDER CRACKS as Price reaches the top and is helped to safety. The Priest steadies the ladder now made unsafe and clearly Claire wants to go onto the roof.

EXT. THE ROOFTOP OF THE CATHEDRAL OF LEON - LATE IN DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THREE SANDINISTAS, PEDRO, AND PRICE EMERGE FROM A TUNNEL onto a lower level of the cathedral rooftop where a body lies. They are exposed immediately and automatic weapons fire opens up on them -- the Sandinistas flatten against a wall, quickly becoming separated from Price and Pedro.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO SANDINISTAS RACE FOR COVER BEHIND A CUPOLA in a move that is equally daring and foolish. The diversion draws fire from the two soldiers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PRICE'S LIGHT METER IS INSTANTLY OUT TAKING READINGS as Pedro huddles with him, curious at this strange act.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO GUARDIA MOVE INTO POSITION TO FLUSH OUT THE SANDINISTAS as they hide behind the cupolas. The hidden Third Guerrilla opens fire killing a Guardia soldier, and the other soldier races for the belltower. As he does:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SANDINISTAS SEIZE THE MOMENT TO RUSH CLOSER, waving to Pedro who slips along a wall with his bag of bombs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PRICE STARTS TO FOLLOW BUT IS PINNED DOWN BY FIRE and chooses to take refuge halfway in an alcove. As fire from both sides ricochets all over the rooftop, Price switches camera lenses seemingly oblivious to the action.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PEDRO MEETS ONE OF THE SANDINISTAS in a protected niche and quickly they are unfolding his bag, setting the "muffin bombs" out on the rooftop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE OTHER TWO SANDINISTAS OPEN HEAVY FIRE and briefly draw heavier fire from the belltower, as:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PEDRO PICKS UP A MUFFIN weighing it briefly in his hand, like a pitcher. He studies the surroundings -- runners on first and third, no outs -- he spits in his left (his pitching hand) and rubs it in casually.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pedro crosses himself, goes into an abbreviated pitching motion, then rears and fires the 'muffin' toward the belltower window, exposing himself as he does.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AN EXPLOSION IN THE TOWER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PEDRO THROWS ANOTHER INTO THE TOWER -- another explosion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A GUARDIA SOLDIER STAGGERS INTO THE WINDOW and a Sandinista drops him with a shot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All is quiet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE THREE SANDINISTAS CAREFULLY RUSH THE TOWER, looking in and motion to Pedro and Price that all is okay, and as they do:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER SHOT RINGS OUT -- they whirl around -- Pedro and Price drop again. A lone Guardia soldier fires at them from the other tower.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A THIRD SANDINISTA DROPS HIM WITH A VOLLEY OF FIRE Again all is quiet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PRICE FOLLOWS THE SANDINISTAS TO THE FIRST BELLTOWER and looks in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FIVE BODIES LIE SCATTERED AND BLOODIED One of the Guerrillas kicks a couple of them to make sure they are dead. In the corner, one body lies on top of another. Satisfied, the Sandinistas head for the other tower.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PRICE STAYS BEHIND TO TAKE A FEW PICTURES and the ever-present light meter appears, followed by several quick shots of the bodies. Then Price goes to one of the arched, stone windows. He looks out over the city.

P.O.V. OF LEON -- DUSK Late in the afternoon now, the fighting is over for the day. An occasional gunshot. Smoke rises from scattered places throughout the city. There is new rubble. The town is littered with bodies.

P.O.V. THE RED CROSS WAGON MOVING THROUGH THE STREET

A man walks in front of it, chanting slowly, rhythmically:

We see a woman drag a body out into the street. The Red Cross man makes small stacks of bodies. He douses the bodies with gasoline and sets the pile aflame. Then continues.

A body rolls out from under another body. Blood-splattered, smiling, wiping the blood from his face. It is Oates, the mercenary from Africa. He peeks out the window -- the Sandinistas are on the other side of the roof. He whispers.

The Three Sandinistas, Pedro, and Price are hiding in the shadows of the main church entrance. The Sandinistas are carefully peeking around the corner, checking out the plaza. It seems safe. The door opens; the Priest lets Claire out. For a moment she looks around to see who's still alive -- in the shadows Price looks like one of the Guerrillas. They see each other and embrace briefly.

The Sandinistas slap hands, familiar with the American gesture. The Six start walking across the plaza away from the church. In the b.g. we see piles of bodies burning; the Red Cross tends to the wounded locals. Spirits are high as they walk. The tiny red light glows on Claire's recorder.

	Hello sweetheart, this is your mother. I'm in Leon and I miss you. Don't worry about me -- it's not dangerous at all. I guess you can't believe what you hear on the news.

Price spots Claire and makes a "What's all this about?" motion. Claire holds out her palms and shrugs -- she doesn't know. All attention is quickly focused on the head table, as:

P.O.V. FOUR FIGURES/CONFERRING IN FRONT OF A TENT Isela emerges and joins them. The others are: THE PRIEST FROM LEON, A BUSINESSMAN WHOM WE SHOULD RECOGNIZE FROM EARLIER SCENES, AND COMMANDANTE CINCO, dressed in camouflaged khaki.

The tent is filled with Sandinista officers and soldiers standing and sitting around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RAFAEL'S BODY LIES ON A TABLE The shirtless upper torso propped slightly upright, still wearing glasses, the figure of Rafael is distinctly non-heroic. He is slightly overweight, slightly balding, but as he lies there surrounded by his men, the the glow of lanterns, he looks almost alive.

	We have momentum, but many more lives will be lost. Even Washington is starting to admit that the butcher Somoza is not loved by his people.

Price lies on his back on a table. Claire sits in a chair, a lantern is on the table. His reclining body is not unlike Rafael's. He plays with a camera without looking at it, turning it slowly, removing and replacing a lens. He's never been this calm, this unmoving.

Claire, however, moves around the tent like a caged animal -- like Price normally is. She smokes. She's nervous and wired.

He nods slightly.

They are led to a shed by the roadside, A TIRE REPAIR SHOP, where they sit down in an oily, dusty shack. They watch the soldiers:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
P.O.V. THE SOLDIERS TEARING UP THE RENTAL CAR, pulling off door panels, looking for weapons.

<DIRECTION>
PRICE AND ALEX JERK TO LIFE at the sound of screaming in the distance. A volley of gunfire follows. Price moves quickly into an adjoining shed and looks through a crack in the wall:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
P.O.V. AN EXECUTION SQUAD IN A FIELD as several bodies are being hauled away. Two soldiers reload their guns. PAN to a figure moving behind a wall -- OATES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PRICE HURRIES THROUGH THE SHACKS TOWARD THE EXECUTION WALL as Alex calls to him and hurries after -- Price is single- minded. As he moves through the shacks we hear another volley of fire, and Price bursts into a clearing to see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO TRUCKS BEING LOADED WITH BODIES AS OATES SUPERVISES. PRICE STEPS INTO THE CLEARING -- FACE-TO-FACE WITH OATES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They look at each other for several beats before anyone speaks. Oates is slightly embarrassed.
</DIRECTION>
<OATES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No pictures, eh? Might look bad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OATES>
<DIRECTION>
Oates smiles half-way; Price looks around at the bodies.
</DIRECTION>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You get paid by the body or by the hour?

Alex arrives and tries to pull Price back -- at the same time he sees the bodies and is sickened at the sight.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
A body is carried through and loaded on a truck. Oates's tone is one of explanation rather than defense, very matter- of-fact.
</DIRECTION>
<OATES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's a motherfucking war goin' on, pal... lotta sad stories.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OATES>
<DIRECTION>
Price mumbles and wanders to the next truck a few feet away, and as he sees it he stops short, speechless. He points:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BODIES OF THE PRIEST FROM LEON AND THE BUSINESSMAN, figures we saw at Rafael's camp, sit in the back of the truck. They are splattered with blood and lifeless. Price is shaken.
</DIRECTION>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why them? Why them?!

Oates has to look to see who he's talking about, and Price loses his cool.

<DIRECTION>
PRICE GRABS OATES AND PUSHES HIM BACKWARDS but Oates responds like an animal. The two men go down in a heap and lash out at each other in the dust. Their fighting is largely ineffective, though very physical, until Oates asserts himself and knocks Price against a wall, breaking free to pick up his automatic rifle that he handles with one hand and shoves it into Price's face.

He leads them under an awning nearby where a couple soldiers sit. A small table, some weapons, two shallow boxes, food, beer. Oates rummages around to find what he wants, and pulls out:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HANDFUL OF PHOTOGRAPHS, mostly snapshots, odd sizes, with names written on them. He sifts through them quickly and we see an assortment of photographs of Nicaraguans. He finds what he's looking for and holds up:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PRICE'S PHOTOGRAPH OF THE PRIEST AND THE BUSINESSMAN, the picture taken in Rafael's camp, blown up, cropped, and identified. The faces are circled.

A cab takes them through the increasingly nervous city. La Guardia troop trucks are everywhere -- things seem more hurried. A hunting rifle sits in the cabbie's lap. They get out and knock on Jazy's door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GUARDIA SOLDIERS WATCH THEM FROM A DISTANCE, a development that Price and Claire are aware of.

Price is impatient. He looks around nervously -- the Guards are out of view -- and he slides a knife into the latch, jimmying the lock. The door opens slowly -- an alarm goes off.

Price and Claire duck inside quickly.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAIRE>

Price, momentarily comfortable with the danger, responds quickly and finds the alarm wire running along the door jamb.

LA GUARDIA TROOPS NEARBY HEAR THE ALARM and head toward Jazy's.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE HOUSE PRICE FINDS THE ALARM BOX which he pries open and expertly pulls two wires. The alarm stops.

Immediately they begin going through drawers and cupboards. She pulls out some harmless snapshots of Miss Panama, replaces them.

BACK INSIDE THE HOUSE we hear the shouting soldiers, banging. Price and Claire look at each other, and the camera bag. Claire points upstairs to Price, to the door for herself. Russell grabs the bag and bounds quickly upstairs. Claire goes to the front door, shaking nervously.

P.O.V. OF RUSSELL'S PHOTOGRAPHS FROM RAFAEL'S CAMP cropped and blown up -- Commandante Cinco, the Priest of Leon, the Businessman, Isela. Photographs of other slain rebel leaders. The pictures include faces that have been circled with names written in -- exactly as in the pictures Oates possessed.

Alex motions that "it's not necessary" and talks to the woman. We can't hear, but she points down the block.

INSIDE THE CAR Price cranks film into place, his actions are automatic and nervous. When he looks up:

P.O.V. ALEX FIFTY YARDS AWAY

Walking in the direction she pointed, he motions to Price as if to say, "Just checking this out."

PRICE LOOKS AROUND NERVOUSLY FOR A SENSE OF DIRECTION And as he does, looks through the camera.

THROUGH CAMERA P.O.V. OF THE DEAD PIG followed by quick blurred pans to other images -- TANK, HOUSE, WOMAN, SOLDIER -- until it settles on ALEX IN THE INTERSECTION. Two Guardia soldiers come up to him and he holds out his hands as if to say, "I'm lost."

ALEX TALKS TO THE SOLDIERS -- FREEZE FRAME click, click -- and the whirring sound of a motor drive, another FREEZE FRAME click, click, more whirring -- Price is on automatic pilot. Another soldier orders Alex up against a wall.

Nobody sees Price taking pictures -- it happens too quickly.

A HELICOPTER GUNSHIP MOVES IN LOW over the barrio and opens up sporadic outbursts of fire to insure nobody will try to flee.

PRICE RUNS DOWN AN ALLEY and nearly runs right into the Guardia. He hides behind a paper thin wall of flattened beer cans -- the Guardia move past him only inches away. Price starts off in another direction, but Guardia appear -- he is trapped in the barrio.

Price doesn't want her to go alone, but he's not that excited about hiding out in the middle of the city either.

<PRICE>

	Aw, Christ...

	Russell... it's more dangerous being with you than being alone.

</CLAIRE>

He knows she's right. He loves her, and he's made enough disastrous decisions lately. He hesitates, then pops open his camera and removes the film. Price ties the film into the white flag that hangs from a stick stuck into her belt.

<DIRECTION>
PRICE AND CLAIRE EMBRACE AND KISS BRIEFLY
</DIRECTION>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't get hurt.

<CLAIRE>
<DIRECTION>
(affectionately)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's great advice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAIRE>
<DIRECTION>
They kiss, and Claire runs out after a Red Cross truck. Price watches nervously until they turn a corner, out of sight, then goes back inside Jazy's courtyard. PRICE NEARLY STUMBLES OVER JAZY'S BODY, stops, stares -- he'd forgotten already. The body makes him uneasy, and after several moments he finds a sheet and covers Jazy. Price then sits down and waits nervously, sharing the courtyard with Jazy.

CLAIRE WALKS ALONGSIDE THE RED CROSS TRUCK as it comes around a corner. The truck turns one direction, she wants to go the other way toward the hotel.

<DIRECTION>
P.O.V. -- THE INTERCONTINENTAL HOTEL ON THE HILL IN DISTANCE - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Guardia troops heavily patrol the ground between Claire and the hotel -- a jeep, a troop carrier, a tanquetta, and fifty foot soldiers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLAIRE TAKES TEMPORARY COVER offered by a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN who sees that she is afraid of La Guardia. Claire steps behind a walled yard. Moments later:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BOY ON A BIKE RIDES SLOWLY OUT OF THE YARD and turns up the hill toward the Guardia and the hotel. Claire's white flag is tied to his handlebars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLAIRE WATCHES FEARFULLY as the boy pedals into the military zone. The woman offers Claire some food; she declines.

TWO GUARDIA TROOP CARRIERS RACE PAST, sirens screaming, loaded with Guardia soldiers. Claire steps into the street unsurely, looking every direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PEOPLE BEGIN COMING OUT OF THEIR HOMES and what remains of their small homes. They come one at a time at first, then in small groups, carrying belongings, pets, chickens, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLAIRE SHOWS A PICTURE OF PRICE AND HER to a woman who comes out of the house next to Jazy's, but the woman shakes her head, not recognizing Price.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A PUSH-PULL PLANE DIVES IN LOW FIRING ROCKETS at the homes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CROWD GROWS and chaotically flees the destruction, gradually finding a direction out of the city. Claire is swept along in the crowds, at first without choice, then finally fleeing for her life with the rest of Managua. As she moves with the crowd, she looks for Price everywhere, without success.

SEVERAL CAMPFIRES burn near the edge of the city where dozens have taken temporary refuge. Claire arrives to see: A BODY ON A STRETCHER BEING CARRIED up outside stairs to a rooftop from which glow several bare bulbs. She goes up the stairs to the rooftop.

A MAKESHIFT MOBILE HOSPITAL under awnings and palm fronds, capable of moving location in minutes. A WOMAN DOCTOR and two temporary orderlies tend to wounded. A small black and white television sits on a table and those who are able watch the seige of Managua on television while it goes on around them. Claire looks for Price among the dead or wounded.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
P.O.V. -- THE CITY UNDER ATTACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Claire watches for several moments -- smoke, flame, the buzzing sound of planes swooping low, fleeing crowds. She then notices the television.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PRICE'S FOOTAGE OF ALEX'S DEATH comes on the TV screen, and she pushes closer to see the grim sequence. The NEWS COMMENTATOR explains in Spanish what we see CLAIRE IS SO DISTURBED AT THE IMAGES that she turns away, sickened, hurt, guilty, outraged, but unable to break down. She closes her eyes -- her face is covered with tears. The Doctor notices this and speaks softly to her.
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Journalist?

(Claire nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You knew the man who was killed?

	Fifty thousand Nicaraguans have died... and now one Yankee.

It takes a while for Claire to respond.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes... perhaps they will.

</CLAIRE>
<DIRECTION>
Noise in the distance from mortars. The Doctor speaks calmly, without bitterness in the voice, but with total conviction.
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe we should have killed an American journalist fifty years ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Claire acknowledges the grim truth of the observation with a slight nod, and walks to the railing as:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALEX'S DEATH IS REPEATED IN FREEZE FRAME SEQUENCE over and over again as the Orderlies, Doctor, and patients gather to watch with fascination.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLAIRE STARES OUT AT THE CITY ON FIRE, when her eye catches something -- a light in the sky. She watches:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
P.O.V. -- A HELICOPTER WITH SEARCHLIGHT PASSES OVERHEAD, momentarily illuminating the hospital, but it continues on, curiously uninterested in the Guerrilla activity. The chopper sweeps above a nearby hill and hovers, then slowly lowers to earth.

CLAIRE WATCHES with interest then descends the stairs.

SOMOZA WATCHES AS A BACK HOE DIGS UP THE COFFINS of his parents. An Army helicopter lands, lighting the scene, and Miss Panama rushes from the chopper into his arms as the turbulence from the blades raises her dress and musses his hair. Soldiers place the dirt-covered caskets on the roofs of Somoza's two Mercedes, hastily tie them down, and the strange motorcade, flanked by two heavily armed jeeps, drives off into the dark.

CLAIRE WATCHES IT ALL from a safe distance, not far from the refugee camp. She turns and walks slowly back to the camp.

Claire sits down against the remains of a wall. The war has overtaken her -- she doesn't know if Price is alive -- and though totally involved, she is at last an observer once again. Claire notices the tiny red light of her recorder is still on. She turns it off, and as the sounds of battle gradually die down, Claire falls asleep -- exhausted.

CLAIRE SLEEPS AGAINST THE WALL as a dog sniffs and licks her face. She awakens with a start -- the dog scurries away. Claire rises and looks around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LOCAL WOMAN PUSHES A CART carrying the wrapped body of her husband through the otherwise quiet streets of Managua.
</DIRECTION>

CLAIRE MOVES THROUGH THE CAMP just coming to life, and looks around trying to interpret the eerie silence. A WOMAN tends to her TWO SMALL CHILDREN.

P.O.V. -- SEVERAL TANQUETTAS AND EARTH MOVERS coming over the hill in the distance. The Refugees look up fearfully and some hide. As the war machinery gets closer, we see that:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SANDINISTAS ARE DRIVING THE MACHINES draped with red and black (F.S.L.N.), blue and white (Nicaraguan), and yellow and white (the Vatican) flags. Graffiti of victory covers the tanquettas.

PEOPLE COME INTO THE STREET CHEERING, embracing, only gradually realizing what has happened.

The woman continues with her children, her comment unemotional, and Claire smiles slightly and walks away, through a city awakening slowly to its victory.

CLAIRE WALKS INTO HER OWN ROOM -- PRICE STANDS AT THE BALCONY looking out at the jubilant city from which smoke still rises.

THE LOBBY IS COMING TO LIFE AGAIN with Regis' camera crew, who look like they've had a long night, a BUS BOY, A MAID, AN OLD COUPLE, and A WHITE WOMAN, 38, with TWO SMALL DAUGHTERS -- all either sit or mill in the b.g.

Price and Claire stand next to the box silently -- there is nothing to say -- but the silence is interrupted by a familiar voice that is polite, unforced, and sincere.

Thousands of people have gathered to celebrate in loud and joyous singing, led by a group on the highest cathedral steps, surrounded by Revolutionary leaders waving to the crowds. A SINGING GROUP sings a song to Nicaragua, and a song to Rafael.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RAFAEL'S BODY IN A FANCY CASKET is carried in through the crowd to wild cheering and singing. High over the pallbearers' heads it moves through the crowds.
</DIRECTION>

PRICE AND CLAIRE STAND TO THE SIDE watching it all. The celebration is joyously infectious, and for the moment we can forget the bloodshed, forget the problems that lay ahead, forget even the death of Alex.

PRICE PULLS OUT A CAMERA and begins taking pictures of the celebration.

ISELA IS AT THE MICROPHONE with other Guerrilla leaders.
