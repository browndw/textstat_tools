EXT. FRONT YARD. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slow motion. Armed troops in black uniforms pour out of unmarked vans and swarm across a lawn in a middle class residential neighborhood. Yuppie neighbours look on in shock, confused. Two of the troops carry a battering ram to the front door of a white two-storey house. A leashed Rottweiler snarls and barks. In position, their comrades point M-16s into first-floor windows, ready to be ambushed. Pan into a window in the kitchen. An attractive woman in her thirties is making breakfast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now, in regular motion, the battering ram breaks open the front door. The woman, startled, drops her spatula.

The prosecutor, a woman of about forty, gives her closing argument blandly. She'd rather be somewhere else.
</DIRECTION>
<PROSECUTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The defendant, Dade Murphy, who calls himself "Zero Cool", has repeatedly committed criminal acts of a malicious nature. This defendant possesses a superior intelligence, which he uses to a destructive and antisocial end. His computer virus crashed one thousand five hundred and seven computer systems, including Wall Street trading systems, single handedly causing a seven point drop in the New York Stock Market.

As she speaks, the camera pans across the court, panning down and stopping on the defendant: eleven year old Dade Murphy.

SEVEN YEARS LATER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Aboard a jetliner, Dade Murphy is staring blankly out the window, wearing headphones. Exterior view from the aircraft of approaching New York City. The view becomes a direct overhead of the buildings and streets of the city, which then metamorphoses (through animation) into chips and digital signals on a stylised computer board. The title logo.

Dade goes to work on OTV. He closes his eyes and a flurry of half-second video clips from old TV shows flashes by. He opens his eyes. His screen says ENTERING ARPS 331 and then wipes to another screen. Automated Record Playback System. There is a graphic representation of the station's automatic videotape changer. Dade turns on his TV set and turns to OTV. It is running a Rush-Limbaugh type TV show.

	Yak yak yak. Get a job!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DADE>
<DIRECTION>
Dade presses a key on his keyboard. The Video Changer diagram lights up in red. At the station, a robotic arm selects a videotape from a huge rack of thousands of tapes. The "America First" tape slides out of the VTR and is replaced by an episode of "The Outer Limits" as Dade watches, drinks Coke and smiles, full of himself.
</DIRECTION>

	Yesssss!

Suddenly, the ARPS screen is replaced by an ominous message:

Dade types:

<DADE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	CRASH OVERRIDE. WHO WANTS TO KNOW?

Dade's screen dissolves into:
</DIRECTION>
<DADE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Unbelievable. A hacker!

Then the screen changes again:

"The Outer Limits" suddenly flashes off.
</DIRECTION>
<DADE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, okay "Acid Burn", that's enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DADE>
<DIRECTION>
Dade starts hacking. Apparently so does Acid Burn. The tape changer machines at OTV are swamped, sometimes fighting over the same tape. The program on TV keeps changing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The message comes up on Dade's computer screen:
</DIRECTION>
<ACID_BURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I WILL SWAT U LIKE THE FLY U R

<DIRECTION>
More dueling tape changers, more half second video clips. Another message.
</DIRECTION>
<ACID_BURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I WILL SNAP YOUR BACK LIKE A TOOTHPICK
	</DIALOGUE>
</ACID_BURN>

As the duel continues, Dade types back a taunt of his own:
</DIRECTION>
<ACID_BURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	MESS WITH THE BEST DIE LIKE THE REST
	</DIALOGUE>
</ACID_BURN>
<DIRECTION>
One last from Acid Burn:
</DIRECTION>
<ACID_BURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	YOU ARE TERMINATED
	</DIALOGUE>
</ACID_BURN>
<DIRECTION>
Then his own computer confirms for him that the connection is terminated.

<DADE>
	<DIALOGUE>

Next morning. Mrs. Murphy is unpacking. Dade emerges from his room in a housecoat. He makes a beeline (dodging moving boxes) for the fridge.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL.

At school, hundreds of teenagers converse, move around, head to class. Dade looks lost among them. He walks up to a skinny latino kid in a faux leopard-skin muscle shirt. The kid is on a pay-phone, speaking in Spanish.

	Hold on, boys and girls. It is I, the Cereal Killer, making my first coast to coast, world wide, global television appearance. Yes, that's right, I'm here to tell you about this heinous scheme hatched from within Ellingson Mineral.

Razor and Blade busily work on keeping him on the air.

<CEREAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But for what, you ask? World domination? Nay. Something far more tacky. A virus called Da Vinci, that when launched, would cause Ellingson Mineral tankers to capsize was to be blamed on innocent hackers. But this virus was really the smokescreen, right. What could be so vitally important to protect that someone would create such a nasty, antisocial, very uncool virus program?

Cereal is now seen and heard on the big screen in Times Square.

	What's this? Is this the unnamed account in the Bahamas where the money was to be stashed? I think so!
	</DIALOGUE>

An account number scrolls below Cereal's chin.

The pillow slides in behind his head, he reaches up to adjust it.
