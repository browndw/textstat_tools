Titles over a close shot of a chorus line, with lots of tits and ass and lean, long legs in a brassy blare of music. We zoom back to the area where DOYLE and RUSSO are beginning to occupy a table. RUSSO takes the seat on the right, eyes immediately on all that ginch, while DOYLE standing, gives their order. We do not hear the dialogue but DOYLE asks RUSSO what he wants BUDDY looks up and says "Cinzano." DOYLE turns and says "Two of these." DOYLE slips into the chair opposite RUSSO and the titles roll on. Unlike RUSSO who is concentrating on the girls, DOYLE is digging the room and the people who occupy the tables in it, as if he is the sort of man who cannot relax until he knows who is around him, why they are there.

RUSSO's eyes come off the show. It is a direct line from DOYLE's gaze to the round, ruddy and arrogant face of SAL BOCA, the apparent host of the table of EIGHT MEN AND WOMEN, the Men in dinner jackets with ties tucked under the collars of blue or white lace-trimmed shirts, the Women in a mixture of pant suits and Catskills cocktail party dresses, their hair coiffed towers.

DOYLE frisks his own pockets for a cigarette, coming up with a collection of laundry slips, crumpled notes, toothpicks and matches.

One of the slips of paper catches his eye as he is going through the ritual of the cigarette mooch, a slip bearing the name of a girl. His attention is really on the entrance of the Club and both his conversation and the cigarette business are detached and incidental to the art of waiting through the stakeout.

A Brooklyn slum street on a morning in November. It is about 11 o'clock and relatively quiet. A scattering of tenement URCHINS give the street some sound and life. There are a couple of dark shops on the street and a bar, all appearing to be closed. We look down the street and pick up DOYLE and RUSSO coming down it, walking very quickly.

The Young Man is thrown in, followed by DOYLE and RUSSO. There are about 20 or 30 PUETRO RICAN and BLACK MEN in the joint, a couple of BLACK WOMEN. They are in all manner of dress. Half of them are wearing shades. The bar is noisy with conversation, laughter and music.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DOYLE and RUSSO standing in the doorway, DOYLE slightly to the left, RUSSO a little behind him. DOYLE's arms are at his sides. RUSSO's right hand is crossed over his belt, under his jacket and on the butt of his .38, ready, waiting to back his partner's play or respond to any move within the bar.

	Best I ever seen was The Rock. He was the calmest and the meanest. Guys like Sugar'd be pukin' before a fight. Jake LaMotta'd be pukin'. Marciano was calm like he was goin' to church.

One night at the Garden about 1950, '51 -- he fought either Jake LaMotta or Gus Lesnevich, I think it was -- he took one o' those cream puff punches in the sixth -- the laziest left you ever seen -- missed him entirely. Down goes Blackjack without even workin' up a sweat and the whole Garden gets up in its feet and I swear to Christ, everybody starts singin' "Dance With Me Henry."

He pours a small quantity of mineral oil into a burnmeister test tube and preheats the oil over the open flame of a tiny alcohol lamp.

He removes a 15-in thermometer from its leather case, fastens the capillary tuve (now totally immersed in the heroin) to the bulb of the thermometer with a rubber band.
