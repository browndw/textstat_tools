<DIRECTION>
TITLES UNFOLD IN BLACKNESS as we are lulled by the distant flute-like sounds of a recorder. Overall the effect is mournful and haunting, elegant and serene...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and we CRASH TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BARENTS SEA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...a storm of inconceivable force and violence. Merciless arctic winds whip the sea in a frenzy of thirty-foot swells.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is the last place in God's creation that any human being should be. And yet...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...the prow of a three-masted ship rises massively before us, looming from the darkness and chaos. it crashes upward through a swell and slams back down again, plunging nose- first into the trough. The sails on the forward mast are still deployed. It's insane; in this weather they should be stowed (as is already the case with masts 2 and 3).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hurtling toward us. Rising and falling. Thundering through the swells. And as she sweeps past CAMERA within a seeming hairbreadth, we PAN with the ship and find ourselves...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SHIP - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...aboard the "Alexander Nevsky," along for the ride whether we like it or not. There are men all around us, dark screaming FIGURES glimpsed and half-glimpsed, heavy oilskin clothes flapping in the gale. A GROUP OF MEN are in a life-or-death tug of war

	PULL, YOU BASTARDS! PULL!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTON>
<DIRECTION>
Riiiiippp! All eyes turn skyward as the uppermost sail tears loose, the heavy canvas shredding away in huge billowing tatters. The jib-arm wrenches free and plummets toward us, trailing rope and fabric. The men dive aside as the jib smashes into the deck like an exploding bomb. Splintered shards of wood cartwheel through the air like shrapnel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walton catches a glancing blow to the head and slams face- down on the pitching deck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRIGORI, the first mate, scrambles to Walton's aid. Walton shoves him off, pushes painfully to his knees. LIGHTNING throws his face into a stark relief map of pain and fury: blood is streaming from his hairline, freezing in his eyes, staining his teeth. He gazes up at the mainsail, still intact and straining against the wind. We hear a huge CRACK!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The base of the mast is starting to give.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cut the damn rigging free before we lose the mast!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTON>
<DIRECTION>
Long-handled axes are grabbed from their mounts. Frantic men begin hacking at the ropes. Walton snatches an axe from a passing crewman and elbows his way to the front. He attacks a guy-rope with primal fury, CAMERA rising and falling with the motion of his axe. Suddenly, a chilling cry from high above:

The LOOKOUT is lashed to the mast by means of a safety rope knotted at the chest. He points ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WALTON and the others spin to look as A PANORAMIC SHOT OF THE BARENTS SEA reveals a magnificent vista of storming fury. The ship is heading into an enormous field of icebergs dotting the ocean like boulders in a quarry, The Nevsky is plying these waters like a man running pell-mell through a mine field.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An iceberg passes massively and unexpectedly in the foreground, rumbling within yards of the camera, wiping us into darkness...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NEVSKY - NIGHT

...and we wipe from darkness as a flapping piece of canvas billows away to reveal 'Walton and the crew, gazing in breathless horror as an iceberg looms from the gale before them like a ghostly white mountain. Walton finds his voice:

THE PILOT fights to turn the wheel. Men rush to his aid, throw their backs into it, straining to the limit. The wheel is grudging, fighting them every inch of the way.

THE CROW'S NEST (MAST #2)

The lookout fumbles under his coat, grabs the rosary around his neck, clutches the crucifix tightly in both hands. Face white with terror. Breath coming in ragged gasps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHIP'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Crashing through the swells. Rising and falling. Tilting the world and the audience on its ear. iceberg looming. For a brief moment we seem to be veering past. But then we swing back in a final, churning, vertiginous plunge...

<DIRECTION>
...and smack the ice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VARIOUS QUICK-CUT ANGLES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
God just hit the ship with an anvil. Mast #1 snaps at the base with a thunderous CRACK and begins to topple in a symphony of shattering wood and tangled rigging...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lookout on mast #2 is vaulted through the railing of the crow's nest, screaming through the air, arms and legs windmilling as he plummets head-first toward the deck below...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And is jerked to an abrupt stop by the safety line around his chest, We hear another horrible CRACK... the sound of his back breaking...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Men are sliding, tumbling, screaming. Mast #1 completes its fall, slamming massively to the deck, shattering a section of the gunwale to splinters. Utter panic. Total chaos...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sheer mortal terror. And as the sequence builds to a final brain-splitting crescendo of sound and fury, we

ARCTIC - TWILIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Total, stunning silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A glittering wasteland of ice. Breathlessly cold. Even the sun seems frozen, barely hanging on the horizon. Pellets of snow scour the permafrost like broken glass, driven by a desolate arctic wind. It's as if Hell had erupted through the floor of the Earth in the form of ice. Nothing could survive here. Nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SLOW PAN reveals a distant ship frozen in the ice, tilted at a permanent list. Silent. We see no signs of life.

A flap of frozen canvas creaks in the wind...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pilot's wheel is now a crystalline sculpture of ice. The forward mast lies across the deck like a broken limb, extending out over the ice on a tangle of rigging...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ship's prow is smashed open above the water line...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A familiar rosary lies broken on the deck. Beads scattered. |A tiny Christ figure lies with arms thrown wide, painted eyes staring up at the sky through a thin sheet of ice...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIGH, HIGH ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the top of mast #2. A breathtaking perspective of the entire ship below, guaranteed to induce vertigo. The corpse of the lookout is suspended below us at the end of the frozen rope, His posture mimics the Christ figure: His arms thrown wide, dead eyes staring up at the sky through a thin sheet of ice. A ghastly still-life, the corpse twisting ever-so- slightly on the wind, rope creaking...

A SAILOR thrusts into frame swaying precariously in the rigging, WIDEN to reveal TWO MORE MEN as they reach out with long gaffing poles to snag the corpse.

EXT. NEVSKY - LOW ANGLE FROM ICE - TWILIGHT

Walton watches them reel the body in. ANGLE SHIFTS as he turns, revealing the rest of the crew working desperately to free the ship. Axes and picks rise and fall in waves, slamming into the ice, throwing up frozen chips. The men are near collapse, exhaustion carved in their faces. The dogs are nearby, huskies and malamutes huddled in the snow. Walton rejoins the men, rams his axe fiercely into the ice.

Cries of dismay from the men. Grigori thrusts his arm toward the sky, pointing at the corpse on the mast.
</DIRECTION>
<GRIGORI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At the cost of how many more lives?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRIGORI>
<DIRECTION>
He's interrupted by a long, chilling HOWL. The lead husky rises to its feet, hackles up, HOWLING at some unseen thing in the distance. The other dogs start rising around him, joining in, staring off across the ice.
</DIRECTION>
<GRIGORI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's something out there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRIGORI>
<DIRECTION>
The dogs are going berserk. The lead husky breaks free and launches himself across the ice. The men scramble to restrain the animals, but three more break away and take off after their leader. Walton snatches up his rifle.

EXT. ARCTIC PANORAMA - TWILIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Nevsky in the distance. The dogs come howling across the ice toward us. The men trail substantially behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOOM DOWN to the icy boulders f.g. A massive hand comes briefly to rest in one of the crags, ghastly gray skin rippling with harsh ligaments and sinewy veins, brutal surgical scars marring the wrist. A HUGE DARK FIGURE wipes frame, fleeing into the rocks. The dogs come bounding past in pursuit, snarling and slavering.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE RUNNING MEN hear an INHUMAN HOWL rise amidst those of the dogs. A vicious free-for-all echoes from the rocks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barking gives way to shrill squeals. An object is launched from the crags, catapulted through the air in a high arc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Some men slip and fall as the object slams to the ground with tremendous impact before them...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and they find themselves staring in horror At the sight of the lead dog. Silence now. Those who have fallen, rise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walton cocks his rifle. The group proceeds, picks and axes held ready, slowly skirting the rocks...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and the massacre is revealed. Blood-stained ice. Dead, mangled animals strewn about. One twitching survivor crawls toward them on broken limbs, whining piteously, dragging its entrails in a red smear.
</DIRECTION>
<GRIGORI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRIGORI>
<DIRECTION>
They follow his gaze. Bloody tracks lead away from the bodies, ascending the rocks. Most are smeared and vague... but one is clearly a bare human footprint. Several men cross themselves. Walton shoulders the rifle, aims down at the surviving dog. BLAM! A single bullet to the brain ends its misery, punching a halo of blood onto the ice. The shot echoes for miles.

Silhouetted against the aurora borealis. The horizon swirls mysteriously with color and light. Distant slivers of lightning kiss the earth.

Walton appears from his cabin and crowds his way to the front, rifle aimed at the sky. The men wait. Holding their breath. Scanning the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AN APPARITION looms eerily from the mist on a creaking floe of ice, silhouetted by the shifting light of the borealis. The figure's pose is uncanny and weird: neither standing nor kneeling, but something in between, arm dangling at its side and lolling slowly with the motion of the current.

The Pilot lights the kerosene wick of a reflector box spotlight and swings it around. The beam seeks out the specter and pins it in a dim circle of light... revealing a man collapsed on a dog sled, lashed to tiller upright stanchions with frozen leather straps, Dead dogs lie in icy heaps around him.

The men venture onto the shifting ice with lanterns raised.

Grappling lines are unslung and thrown, the ice floe snagged. Gaffs reach out, drawing it closer. Men clasp arms, forming a human chain. Grigori is the first to reach the motionless figure on the dog sled.

	Dead?

</WALTON>
<DIRECTION>
Grigori cautiously eases his hand into the darkness of the furred hood to search the neck for a pulse...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and the figure scares the shit out of him. With a convulsive shudder and a gasping intake of breath, the hood rises up, revealing a haggard face tortured white with frost, beard frozen solid, eyes blazingly intelligent and aware. Walton finds himself in an extended beat of eye contact with VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN.

...and they sweep from before our eyes, waltzing away from camera to reveal Victor now 17, intense and handsome as he approaches manhood. Elizabeth is a blossoming and graceful beauty at 16. Mrs. Moritz is still conducting the lessons.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_MORITZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...one-two-three, twirl-two-three... Excellent! You'll be the envy of all the young ladies and gentlemen!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MORITZ>
<DIRECTION>
They're certainly the envy of Justine, who gazes at Victor as he sweeps Elizabeth around the room in his arms. She isn't concentrating and fumbles on the keyboard. Her mother throws her a look of reproval:
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_MORITZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Justine. Surely you can maintain better time than that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MORITZ>
<JUSTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Mama.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUSTINE>
<DIRECTION>
Flustered, she puts her attention back on the keyboard as Victor and Elizabeth keep dancing, swirling fluidly about the room, their attention only on each other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A skylight above us. A storm is raging, rain drumming the glass. We hear SCREAMING in the house. TILT DOWN to Victor perched at the edge of a settee, seething with tension.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Waiting. Elizabeth is with him. She squeezes his arm, trying to reassure him.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIZABETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She'll be all right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIZABETH>
<DIRECTION>
Another SCREAM rips down the hallway. Justine comes scurrying up the stairs, about to enter his parent's room with a fresh load of sheets. Victor lunges to his feet and intercepts, trying to push past her, but finds the doorway implacably blocked by Mrs. Moritz.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_MORITZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can do nothing here. Wait downstairs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MORITZ>
<DIRECTION>
He can see his mother in the dim kerosene light, writhing and screaming on the bed, belly swollen and distended. His father, sleeves rolled up, works feverishly to save her.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mother?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<FATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Victor, do as you're told!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER>
<DIRECTION>
Justine glances at Victor, longing to comfort him. She squeezes past into the room. The door slams in his face. He turns to Elizabeth, eyes brimming with terror...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PARENTS' BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...as his mother falls back on the sweat-soaked sheets, blowing air like a bellows, trying to give birth...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MANSION - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...while her SCREAMS mingle with the howling of the wind, the stump of the long-dead oak tree pokes from the earth in the foreground like a gravestone, lashed by the rain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DOWNSTAIRS PARLOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VICTOR stares out the window at the raging storm. Elizabeth appears at his side. He doesn't look at her.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As a boy, I stood at this window and watched God destroy our tree.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
b.g. screaming stops, Victor and Elizabeth turn, gazing up the grand staircase. The sudden silence is even more frightening. The FAINT CRY of a newborn infant drifts down A door opens upstairs, throwing a spill of light. Victor's father appears in silhouette, comes down the stairs toward them. He pauses halfway down, unable to continue.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Father?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
A FLASH OF LIGHTNING floods the room, revealing Victor's father on the staircase. Face haggard. Eyes hollow. Clothes spattered with blood. Hands glistening wetly red.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIZABETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh God. The blood.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIZABETH>
<DIRECTION>
Father sits down shakily on a step. Victor and Elizabeth race up the stairs and pause before him.
</DIRECTION>
<FATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I did everything I could.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER>
<DIRECTION>
Victor lets out a sob of anguish. Elizabeth begins to cry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Father gathers them into his arms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FRANKENSTEIN ESTATE - CEMETERY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BABY CARRIAGE stands amidst leaning gravestones, gothic and ornate, a chill breeze billowing the lace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A PRIEST recites a Latin burial mass. DOZENS OF MOURNERS are gathered before the Frankenstein family mausoleum... an imposing edifice of stone and spidery wrought-iron, its steepled roof crowned by a massive granite crucifix.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sleek black casket lies atop the bier, ringed with flowers and sorrow. The trees are windswept and bare, branches stark against a steely gray sky. Victor and Elizabeth stand apart from the others, staring at the casket. Softly:
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How could all my father's knowledge and skill fail to save her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<ELIZABETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not ours to decide. All that live must die. It's God's will.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIZABETH>
<DIRECTION>
Victor raises a grim look at the huge crucifix atop the mausoleum. Christ returns his gaze with blank stone eyes
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What kind of God is He to will this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<ELIZABETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She was mother to me as well. But ours is the job of the living. It's up to us now to hold this family together. We must think of Father and be strong for him.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I cannot do that alone.

</ELIZABETH>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God took her from us.

</VICTOR>
<ELIZABETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He left a beautiful gift in her place. A baby boy. To cherish and love as our very own. Your brother
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIZABETH>
<DIRECTION>
Victor glances at the baby carriage. He seeks her hand. Their fingers clasp. Comfort and strength.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our brother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
The baby starts CRYING as the casket is lowered, its thin voice carried on the wind...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MEADOW - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A gorgeous, sun-dappled day. Tall grass waving on the breeze. Butterflies skittering. WILLIAM, 11 months-old, toddles into view. He doesn't get far. PLOP! Down he goes, right on his ass. His face scrunches up in surprise and he bursts into tears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elizabeth hurries over and scoops him up, cradling and comforting him. Victor rises from a picnic blanket to join them. Nanny Justine looks up from her task of laying out the silverware and food.
</DIRECTION>
<JUSTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Poor William! What indignant tears!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUSTINE>
<ELIZABETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There, there... shhh...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIZABETH>
<DIRECTION>
Victor takes the baby and swoops him high in the air. The child shrieks and wails, held aloft.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIZABETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Victor, have a care! You'll make him dizzy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIZABETH>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The world is a dizzying place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
She tries to reclaim the baby. Victor feints, keeping Willie out of reach. Elizabeth grows crosser:
</DIRECTION>
<ELIZABETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, do give him here! He needs to be comforted and held!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIZABETH>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He needs to vent his outrage to the skies! Make yourself heard, Willie! Learning to walk is not an easy thing! Why should it be so?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Elizabeth is exasperated to realize that the baby has begun to laugh. She glares at both of them. Men.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIZABETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the nature of all progress, William. Don't let your brother sway you otherwise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIZABETH>
<JUSTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quite right!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUSTINE>
<DIRECTION>
Victor cradles Willie as if to shield his delicate ears. He peers at Elizabeth with mock-grave suspicion and speaks to the baby sotto-voce, in deepest confidence, man-to-man:
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't listen, Willie. Progress is a feast to be consumed. Women would have you believe you must walk before you can run. Or run before you can waltz!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<ELIZABETH>
<DIRECTION>
(laughing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give me that child before you fill his head with drivel!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIZABETH>
<DIRECTION>
Victor waltzes the baby in circles. Elizabeth stalks them.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Devil take walking, ladies! My brother shall learn to waltz!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs her by the waist, pulls her into it. There's no use resisting. She succumbs and they dance with the baby between them. Justine is gasping with laughter.
</DIRECTION>
<JUSTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Elizabeth, really! He's quite mad!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUSTINE>
<ELIZABETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Scandalous! What would your dear mother say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIZABETH>
<JUSTINE>
<DIRECTION>
(thinks a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One-two-three, one-two-three, twirl- two-three...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUSTINE>
<DIRECTION>
Laughing, Victor and Elizabeth waltz little William around in a sweeping arc. They pass within inches of the CAMERA, bodies wiping frame...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GRAND BALLROOM - NIGHT (6 YEARS LATER)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
To reveal the grand ballroom ablaze with candlelight and spectacle as a HUNDRED DANCERS swirl about the floor in a breathtaking waltz to the music of a full string ensemble (NOTE: The music here should be our movie's distinctive WALTZ/LOVE THEME, which will reoccur later.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Victor and Elizabeth dance magnificently, room spinning about them in a blur. Now 24, he's in the prime of manhood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elizabeth, 23, is a drop-dead beauty radiating poise and intelligence. They're so right for each other, so beautiful together, your heart could break just looking at them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Justine, now 21, has blossomed into a beauty herself. She's at the sidelines, wearing a lovely gown, wishing someone would ask her to dance. William, now 7, scampers to her side. She stoops to straighten his collar and smooth back his hair. Waltzing couples swirl past them.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Auntie Justine, Papa said I could have a sweet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<JUSTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can. But not before dinner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUSTINE>
<DIRECTION>
The music ends amidst applause. The men bow to the ladies, the ladies curtsy in return. Victor escorts Elizabeth off the dance floor. Elizabeth fans herself, flushed and happy.
</DIRECTION>
<JUSTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You dance so beautifully together.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUSTINE>
<ELIZABETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you look so lovely.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIZABETH>
<DIRECTION>
They share a sisterly hug and a radiant smile. The orchestra recommences. The music is lush. Justine looks hopefully to Victor, keeping her tone light:
</DIRECTION>
<JUSTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Victor? Spare me one dance?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUSTINE>
<DIRECTION>
Elizabeth catches Victor's eye.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIZABETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go on, ask her. Please. I'm quite out of breath.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIZABETH>
<DIRECTION>
Victor gallantly offers his arm. Justine takes it, lighting up as he escorts her onto the dance floor ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and they begin to dance. She's glowing. This is a big moment for her. But they've hardly begun, when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...ting-ting-ting, Victor's father is tapping a champagne glass with a knife. The dancers stop. The orchestra falls silent. Justine hides her disappointment as servants pass among the guests with glasses of champagne.
</DIRECTION>
<FATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My friends, fatherly pride won't allow this occasion to pass without my raising a toast.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER>
<DIRECTION>
Shouts of assent. Victor is grabbed by his friends and dragged forward, a glass of champagne shoved in his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<FATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To Victor. My son. Who read every medical book in my library by age thirteen... and then re-read them, which seemed excessive even to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(the guests ROAR with laughter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drape yourself in glory, my boy. Study well. When you return, you return a man of medicine. I will then be honored to call you "colleague."
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But never your equal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<FATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. You'll surpass me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER>
<DIRECTION>
Applause and roars of approval. The drinks are tossed back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Victor is jostled with backslaps and handshakes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MANSION - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Music and warm light spill from the windows. A COUPLE eases through a French door and come racing across the lawn, giggling and hushing each other. They take refuge under a tree, revealing their faces to the moonlight: Victor and Elizabeth. She leans against the trunk to catch her breath.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIZABETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Smell the air. Wonderful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIZABETH>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quite a send-off, isn't it?

</VICTOR>
<ELIZABETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Father's so proud.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIZABETH>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you?

</VICTOR>
<ELIZABETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Prouder still. You'll be the handsomest student there.

</ELIZABETH>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll have to do better than that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<ELIZABETH>

	You will.

<DIRECTION>
(searches his eyes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you want, Victor?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIZABETH>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To be the best there ever was. To push our knowledge beyond our dreams... to eradicate disease and pestilence... to purge mankind of ignorance and fear...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
He's so serious, she can't help laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not mad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles, smoothes a lock of hair gently off his forehead.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIZABETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Just very earnest. And very dear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIZABETH>
<DIRECTION>
An extended moment. Unspoken words flowing between them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Victor leans forward and kisses her. Her eyes widen slightly. So do his. Shared excitement, gentle and sexy beyond belief. They pause, draw back, searching each other's eyes. He whispers:
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've loved you all my life
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<ELIZABETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All my life I've known.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIZABETH>
<DIRECTION>
They kiss again. A breath. A shiver.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This feels... incestuous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<ELIZABETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that what makes it so delicious?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIZABETH>
<DIRECTION>
She brushes her lips against his. Gentle as a sigh.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIZABETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Brother and sister still?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIZABETH>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wish to be your husband.

</VICTOR>
<ELIZABETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wish to be your wife.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIZABETH>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then come with me to Ingolstadt. Marry me now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<ELIZABETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If only I could. But one of us must stay. Father's not strong. Willie's just a child. Who can look after them in your absence? Who can run the estate?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIZABETH>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<ELIZABETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will be here when you return.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIZABETH>
<DIRECTION>
Another kiss. Turning lustful and steamy. They melt into each other, sinking down, bodies pressing and minds afire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
These people are hot for each other. They stop, stunned at the intensity. He lays his head to her breast. Their fingers clasp. She whispers her secret:
</DIRECTION>
<ELIZABETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My head is spinning. I want to give myself to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIZABETH>
<DIRECTION>
He raises his head. She meets his gaze evenly
</DIRECTION>
<ELIZABETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If we're to be married, must we wait?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIZABETH>
<DIRECTION>
He touches her face. Fingertips tracing downward, gentle and reverent, brushing the contours of her bosom at the edge of her bodice. She shivers. Closes her eyes. Lays her hand over his. Guiding his touch.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You make me weak.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<ELIZABETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not as weak as I.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIZABETH>
<DIRECTION>
She raises his hand to her mouth. Brushing his fingertips with her lips. Wrestling with desire. Their eyes meet.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIZABETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our decision. Together.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIZABETH>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your decision. For us.

They kiss again. Gently...

EXT. FRANKENSTEIN ESTATE - CEMETERY - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A misty gray dawn. Victor is kneeling at a gravestone, observing a moment of silence. His saddled horse is tethered nearby. Softly:
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll make you so proud, Mother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
He lays a small sprig of flowers on the grave, rises and walks toward his horse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MANSION - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Overcast and chill. An open carriage stands loaded. The family and household staff have turned out. Victor stands ready to go. Father pulls him into a back-slapping embrace.
</DIRECTION>

Victor moves on to Justine, takes her hand.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Someday we shall.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Next is William. The little boy stands stiffly, tears on his face, trying to be brave. Victor kneels and whispers:
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The others will look to you while I'm gone, Willie. Be strong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
The boy nods miserably, throws his arms around Victor's neck. Last comes Elizabeth. She and Victor regard each other, sharing the secret of last night. A faint smile plays at the corners of her mouth. He kisses her cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Elizabeth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
He mounts the carriage. CLAUDE snaps the reins and lurches away, speeding Victor off to his future. Victor turns back for a final look at the home and family he loves so much.

William runs after him until he's gone from sight...

She leads him into an immensely long space running a twisted path the entire length of the building; various levels and areas unhindered by wall separation, massive vaulted beams crisscrossing as understructure to the roof. Daylight filters dimly through dozens of dormer windows and skylights coated with grime. Nooks and crannies abound.

PROFESSOR KREMPE, a squat little man, paces before the packed galleries of eager young STUDENTS.
</DIRECTION>
<KREMPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In science, the letter of fact is the letter of law. Our pursuit is as dogmatic as any religious precept. Think of yourselves as disciples of a strict and hallowed sect. Someday you may be priests... but only if you learn the scripture chapter and verse.

This reference is lost on all but a few. At the faculty table: PROFESSOR WALDMAN peers up at Victor, adjusting the glasses on his nose. Up among the students: HENRY CLERVAL leans out and shoots an amused look in Victor's direction.

SCHILLER catches Henry's look and rolls his eyes.

Titters sweep the room. Krempe remains staunchly unamused:
</DIRECTION>
<KREMPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those of you unfamiliar with Mr. Frankenstein's suggested reading list... thankfully, that would be most of you... would be well advised to avoid it. Here at Ingolstadt, we concern ourselves with immutable reality...

Victor exits wearing a distinctive black greatcoat, fuming over the exchange with Krempe. He strides across the lawn, eyes fixed straight ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Henry Clerval races up behind him and falls casually in step. Victor glances over. Henry nods pleasantly, as if held been there all along. Victor responds with a curt nod and resumes his straight-ahead demeanor. They walk in silence, just two guys heading in the same direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Henry can't help it; he snickers loudly to himself. Victor shoots him a sharp look. Henry's smirk vanishes, replaced with blank innocence. Did somebody snicker?
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>

INT. AUTOPSY ROOM - DAY

Waldman, in sinock, addresses a GROUP OF STUDENTS from across morgue slab. He throws a sheet back to reveal a corpse dissected to reveal the inner workings. The others crowd for a closer look. Victor glances to Henry, who leans back and rolls his eyes in utter disgust.

Victor storms out with Krempe at his heels. Krempe pauses in the doorway, red-faced, bellowing after him:

Victor and Henry slouched at their regular table writes in his thick, well-worn leather journal.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The entire school heard it. It wasn't something one could miss.

</HENRY>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a comfort to me, Henry.

<VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a letter to my father.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Henry falls silent. Victor closes the journal, winds it secure with its leather thong, jams it deep in the outer pocket of his greatcoat. Brooding. The bell above the door JINGLES. A gust of wind sweeps in. They glance up. Professor Waldman enters, dapper and soft-spoken, impeccably courteous. He murmurs a pleasantry to the INNKEEPER and drifts over to Victor's table.
</DIRECTION>

	</DIALOGUE>
</WALDMAN>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To say the least. I came here to expand my mind, but honest inquiry seems strangled at every turn. All we do is cling to the old knowledge instead of seeking the new.

</VICTOR>
<WALDMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You disdain accepted wisdom?

	...yes, and thanks to him, smallpox has been virtually eliminated. I've heard this speech before.

INT. WALDMAN'S HOME - WORKSHOP - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The gaslights come up with a SOFT HISS. The first thing Victor and Henry notice is an artist's nook situated adjacent to big windows where the light would be best during the day. Easels are lined with in-progress work on a variety of subjects, everything from landscapes to anatomical studies, all quite excellent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rest of the place is a laboratory crammed floor-to-rafter with arcane equipment. Taking off his coat and rolling up his sleeves, Waldman leads Victor and Henry down rows of tables crammed with experiments and clutter.
</DIRECTION>
<WALDMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know for thousands of years the Chinese have based their medical science on the belief that the human body is a chemical engine run by electricity? They say we all contain streams of energy which flow through us like currents in the ocean, or rivers in the earth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALDMAN>
<DIRECTION>
They arrive at a table. Waldman roots through a tray of knickknacks, holds up an acupuncture needle.
</DIRECTION>
<WALDMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Their doctors treat patients by inserting needles like these into the flesh at various key points to manipulate these electric streams.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALDMAN>
<DIRECTION>
He directs their attention to an ancient Chinese silk on the wall. It depicts the human body from front and side angles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Acupuncture points are clearly marked.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Preposterous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<WALDMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I once saw it done, as a boy in Canton. My parents were missionaries. The cure was nothing short of miraculous.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off their looks)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've never forgotten it. Been fascinated ever since.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALDMAN>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It smacks of magic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
Waldman slides forth a steel pan and uncovers it to reveal an enormous dead toad in dissection. Copper mounting pins trail wires to a small panel of switches. The switches, in turn, are connected to a series of galvanic batteries.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Waldman starts throwing switches. Victor and Henry jump as the toad convulses with motion. They watch, stunned, as Waldman puts the toad through its paces: legs kick, feet flex, mouth opens and closes, lungs breathe.
</DIRECTION>
<WALDMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Magic. Seems alive, doesn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALDMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Waldman shuts the thing down, strips off his gloves, his arm at the array of wires and batteries.
</DIRECTION>
<WALDMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Electricity.

	It's utterly fantastic! This is the sort of thing I'm talking about! We should be learning this!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<WALDMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why? God alone knows what it means. Until it has proven value, it's nothing more than a ghoulish parlor trick. Hardly fit for the classroom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALDMAN>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But the possibilities. Combining ancient knowledge with new? Something like this could change our fundamental views!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<WALDMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is a thrilling direction to explore. Thrilling and dangerous.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off his look)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Nature can be wonderful and terrible. Science is not a realm for the reckless; it needs a conscience. We must proceed cautiously. Assess as we go.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What I do on my own time is my own business. The same holds true for you. You wish to expand your mind? Fine, do so. You can even join me here, if you like. But not at the expense of your normal studies.

	I doubt that decision is still mine to make.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Nonsense. Tonight you will draft an apology to Professor Krempe...

Victor starts to object, but Waldman overrides him with a stern gesture for silence. Listen.
</DIRECTION>
<WALDMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"...a sincere and heartfelt apology which you will then read aloud to him before the assembled student body and faculty.

Waldman squeezes Victor's elbow. Well done. Victor stiffens at Krempe's approach.

TIGHT ANGLE ON the locket lying open against canvas, dangling from an easel frame. TILT DOWN to reveal a magnificent miniature oil portrait of Victor in progress, no more than three inches high within its penciled oval.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Waldman paints with an extraordinarily delicate touch, jeweler's glasses riding low on his nose, eyes unnaturally large behind the magnifying lenses. Victor sits patiently for the portrait, suffused with daylight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Henry leans in over Waldman's shoulder, studying the portrait. Waldman stiffens a bit, aware of his presence. He clearly hates people looking over his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
(deadpan)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shouldn't the nose be above the mouth?

INT. WALDMAN'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Victor, Waldman, and Henry are gathered around the remains of a meal, laughing uproariously, enjoying one another's company. Cigars are lit, wine is flowing. Conversation is fast and loose, intense and passionate:
</DIRECTION>
<WALDMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm quite serious. Look at all the charity and clinic work we do. Up until thirty years ago, the concept of vaccine was unheard of.
	</DIALOGUE>

<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're saying all disease will eventually be eradicated?
	</DIALOGUE>

The "doctors" in attendance are all Ingolstadt STUDENTS performing community service, none of whom look like they're enjoying it. Schiller looks particularly harried. We find Victor and Henry giving out vaccinations. They keep glancing over their shoulders at Waldman as he gets further embroiled in a no-win argument with a wiry, ferret-faced MAN terrified about getting his vaccination:
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yer not stickin' it in me! Got pox in it, I hear tell!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<FAT_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pox? They givin' us pox?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAT_WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Ripples of panic spread. Waldman is as tense and clipped as we've ever seen him, valiantly trying to control his temper amidst the surrounding cacophony and ad-lib dialogue:
</DIRECTION>
<WALDMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it's not pox, it's a vaccine...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALDMAN>
<FAT_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vaca-what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAT_WOMAN>
<WALDMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...vaccine, from the Latin vacca, meaning cow
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(glances at her girth)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...or vaccinia, meaning cowpox...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALDMAN>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you there was pox in it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<WALDMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...no, no, cowpox in a minute quantity, perfectly harmless, gives you a natural immunity to small ox, which is the point of this whole bloody exercise...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALDMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Victor and Henry are pausing work. Concerned. Drifting closer. The ferret-faced man is cornered.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You doctors kill people! I don' care what you say, you ain't stickin' it in me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<WALDMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I most assuredly am! It prevents disease and it's the law! Why am I explaining myself? Somebody restrain this damn fool!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALDMAN>
<DIRECTION>
It happens this fast: There's an innocuous blur of motion as the man seems to tap Waldman lightly in the stomach, then he darts away, slamming past Victor and Henry. Victor looks after him running away, hears something clatter to the floor. He glances down. A thin knife. Victor looks to Waldman. Puzzled. It still hasn't really dawned.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Waldman turns to them, face drained of color, hand pressed to his sternum, lips tight. He looks more annoyed than anything else. He exhales slowly.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Professor?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<WALDMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALDMAN>
<DIRECTION>
That's when the blood starts pumping through his fingers. They catch him as he collapses, cradling him as he sprawls to the floor. People are pushing and crowding to see.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. POOR HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A cobblestoned street-scene. Carriage. A delivery wagon. Vendors. Pedestrians. The doors of the poor house burst open, releasing a frenzy into the street: Victor and Henry carrying Waldman by his arms and legs, all the students running alongside, some of them weeping with panic, the crowd at their heels still trying to catch a glimpse, pedestrians scattering, the students dwindling up the long winding street, bearing their professor toward the school, shouting for help...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UNIVERSITY CHAPEL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Krempe delivers the eulogy before the open casket. The chapel is full. Victor is seated near the back. Dazed. Henry comes up the aisle and slides in next to him. Victor doesn't even glance over. Henry whispers:
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They just caught the man who did it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They'll hang him all the same.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. I'll be there to hear his worthless neck snap.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
People glance back. Henry lays his hand on Victor's elbow.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep your voice down. You don't know what you're saying.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was wrong, Henry! It shouldn't have happened! The bastard deserves to die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Victor is causing ripples of attention throughout the chapel. Even Krempe falters briefly in his eulogy. Henry pulls Victor from the pew, drags him up the aisle...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONFESSION BOOTH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and into the confessional where they launch at each other in harsh whispers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dialogue here is overlapping and intense:
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're making a scene!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why Waldman? He of all people should have cheated death!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't. Death is God's will!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I resent God's monopoly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's blasphemy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Blasphemy be damned! Waldman spent his life trying to help people!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(beat, low)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. He had more important work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are sick people who need our help. Here and now. Not in some future time. Consider that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
Henry exits. Victor tries to compose himself, clasping his hands together as if in prayer... or quiet rage. He gazes up. There on the wall hangs a crucifix.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Life and death.
	</DIALOGUE>

	Why should You alone have the final say?

VICTOR'S POV PUSHING SLOWLY IN on the Christ figure before him, bleeding from a crown of thorns, arms thrown wide.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DA VINCI'S STUDY OF MAN rises from the image of Christ, striking an eerily similar pose, arms thrown wide within the perfect circle. We hear a DOOR BEING UNLOCKED as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WALDMAN'S WORKSHOP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...a WIDER ANGLE reveals the deserted workshop. The door swings open as Victor lets himself in. He sees the finished locket lying open on a table, picks it up, studies the beautiful miniature portrait it contains. Snaps it shut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up, eyes falling upon the Da Vinci print hanging on the wall. He stares. Intense.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WALDMAN'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRACKING SHOT: Things are in the process of being sorted and boxed. We find Victor poring over Waldman's notes:
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To understand the causes of life, we must first have recourse to death... and examine the process in minutest detail...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TOWN SQUARE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A gray day. Waldman's ferret-faced MURDERER stands weeping helplessly on the scaffold as sentence is read:
</DIRECTION>
<MAGISTRATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...his body to be left on public display for a twenty-four hour period, thereafter to be consigned to an unmarked pauper's grave. So the court has spoken.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGISTRATE>
<DIRECTION>
The EXECUTIONER draws the hood over the murderer's head, cinches the noose tight. The condemned man is blubbering, pleading for his life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Victor stands in the crowd. Watching. Waiting. We hear the THUMP of the body dropping, the CRACK of a snapping neck...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dark as Hades. Pissing down rain. A FLASH OF LIGHTNING and a CRASH OF THUNDER. The dead man still hangs from the scaffold, lashed by the wind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Victor looms from the storm, hands jammed in the pocket of his greatcoat. He pulls out a thin, glittering blade. The very weapon which took Waldman's life. He gazes up at the dead man... at the rope from which he dangles...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dead murderer lies pale and naked on a slab. Victor leans close, still dripping, studying the face closely. A FLASH OF LIGHTNING throws wild, skittering shadows through the dormer windows and skylights. Softly:
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No longer pathetic and useless
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VICTOR'S GARRET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dead man, dissected and wired, jerks bolt upright, flopping and convulsing, eyes opening and closing, mouth gaping open and shut. He falls back limply as Victor shuts the power off, making careful notations in his journal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VICTOR'S GARRET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRACKING the dissection table... up the length of the murderer's body... now in an advanced stage of decay... we hear the SOFT BUZZING of flies...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We find Victor standing over the corpse. Gaunt and hollow- eyed. Exhausted and obsessed. Wearing a butcher's apron. Staring down at one of the dead man's forearms. Maggots are swarming in the flesh. He abruptly raises a cleaver and WHACKS it off at the elbow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRACKING SLOWLY past the forearm lying in a steel pan, we find Victor performing an intense chemical analysis. Dead tissues are breaking apart in solvents, distilled over a slow-burning flame. Victor smears a glass slide, places it under a microscope.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GASTHOF - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Victor is hunched over his notebook, pale and unhealthy, scribbling notations next to a rendering of the human form. Henry is across from him:
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Victor. This has got to stop.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Victor glances up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nobody's seen you in months. You haven't attended a single class.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been preoccupied.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We all know how hard you took Waldman's death. Even Krempe is sympathetic. But it is time to move on. It is time to concern yourself with life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That is my concern.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(faint smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm involved in something just now. I want to finish it in Waldman's memory.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How much longer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Few months perhaps. I'm gathering the raw materials even now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wrought-iron doors of a crypt have been forced open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PUSHES through to find Victor standing inside over a stone sarcophagus with a pry bar in his hands. He's nervous, working up his courage:
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Materials. That's all they are Tissue to be re-used.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
He pries off the stone lid. It THUMPS heavily to the floor, cracking in half. He opens the casket, reaches in, raises the pale arm of the deceased to inspect it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stone monuments. Bare trees. Ivy-covered ground. Victor shoulder-deep in a grave. Shoveling. A lamp burns low.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COFFIN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pitch black. The lid swings open, cascading dust and soil. Victor peers down, holding the kerosene lamp high.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRACKING ALONG the shelves, crammed now with formaldehyde jars of feet and hands, brains and kidneys, the occasional head staring through the glass, dead cats...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and we find Victor working into the wee hours. Hunched over his specimens. Candle flame flickering low. Referring back to Waldman's notes. Making notations in arcane books such as "De Occulta Philosophia," by Agrippa, and "Le Sciences et les arts D'alchimiste," by Paracelsus.

FRANKENSTEIN ESTATE - LATE DAY

A magnificent backdrop of mountains against a cloudless blue sky. TILT DOWN to Elizabeth and Justine with the mansion distant. A steady breeze ripples the fields as Elizabeth regards a stack of mail.

Elizabeth gives her a hug. They walk toward the mansion

INT. BLACKSMITH SHOP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Murky and dark. Bellows are pumping. Showers of sparks cascade. The BLACKSMITH and his ASSISTANT are pounding a metallic sledgehammer litany, beating a huge copper sheet into shape. Victor enters. The blacksmith directs his attention to a finished copper piece leaning against the wall. Victor runs his hand over the surface. Nice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MATERNITY WARD - CHARITY HOSPITAL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A WOMAN lies on a table, screaming as she goes into labor. Her water breaks, cascading into a steel bucket. One of the ASSISTANTS snatches it up, scurries around the corner. Victor is waiting in the shadows. Money changes hands.

INT. VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

Victor is examining the amniotic fluid. Boiling it off. Working to synthesize it.

Victor pours the final drum of fluid into what appears to be a large copper vat. He dips his hand in, examines the consistency and smell. ANGLE WIDENS, spinning slowly up to reveal that the vat is human in shape. A sarcophagus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We find Victor examining three corpses on the back of a wagon, checking nostrils and teeth with gloved hands. A PAIR OF MEN lurk in the shadows, waiting.

Victor wearing elbow-length gloves, hacking furiously away with a bone saw. Tossing aside the scraps.

<DIRECTION>
VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Victor has an arm wired, testing reactions. He scrapes off a small shred of tissue, drops it in solution, watches it break apart. It doesn't look good. He glances feverishly at the clock, makes a fast decision, scribbles in his journal:
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not optimal. Must use. No time to replace. Body can't wait.

VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT

Victor pulls on a chain, hoisting the body off the slab via block-and-tackle mounted on a ceiling track. The body rises limply into the air, spinning slowly, arms and legs dangling, long black hair covering its face.

<ARCTIC_VICTOR>

	A patchwork man of my own devising.

Victor reaches up with one hand to stop the body spinning.

He pushes it down the length of the lab, rolling it along its ceiling track like a side of beef in a meat locker.

INT. VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Creature lies on an improvised bier of crates, surrounded by shadows and clutter, draped/sprawled like Christ taken from the cross in Michelangelo's "Pieta."

Beakers bubbling and dripping. Intravenous lines seeping and secreting. A misty chemical haze in the air. Victor is watching his patchwork man. Glowering. Waiting.

VICTOR'S GARRET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We find Victor passed out in a chair. His creation is still taking fluids. Gray daylight streams through the windows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's commotion in the street outside: shouting, horses' hooves clattering on cobblestone, an occasional scream or wail. Victor doesn't stir. Dead to the world. Somebody starts POUNDING on the door. Victor rouses, takes a moment to remember where he is. He lurches from his chair, grabs a canvas tarp, throws it over his "patchwork man."
</DIRECTION>

STAIRWELL - DAY

Henry is pounding. Finally the latch is drawn. The door swings open a crack. Victor peers out. Gaunt and furtive. Suspicious. Henry is stunned at his dissipated appearance.

Nothing. Stunned and hurt, Henry turns from the door and heads back down the stairs.

EXT. VICTOR'S BUILDING - STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Henry exits into a nightmare. REFUGEES are streaming from the city, horses and wagons, people on foot, carrying their possessions. Henry steps into the street and is nearly run down by a carriage.

He snaps the reins, not caring who he runs down. The carriage lurches away, scattering refugees before it.
</DIRECTION>

Henry keeps walking. Jostled by the hostile crowd. Looking around. Dazed. Dead bodies are stacked along the street like cordwood, waiting for the death carts. ANGLE WIDENS as Henry stumbles along through utter despair and devastation, stunned at the human suffering around him as we

INT. VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Victor glances at the clock. Scribbles in his journal:
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Time running out. Rate of decay accelerating. Must strike now... or start again from scratch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
He gazes down at his creation, lying once again on the slab before him... but now the Creature lies on a full body-length steel grate. Steel chains with hooks dangle from the ceiling above... along with long coils of thick copper wire tipped with glittering needles big enough to knit with.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Victor glances up at the Da Vinci. The Study of Man has been daubed with red paint at key acupuncture points. Victor dips a huge cotton swab in a bowl of iodine, starts dabbing identical marks on the body before him...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now he's ramming the huge wire-fed needles deep into these spots, brutally working them around in the flesh to get good contact. The forearms, the neck, the rib cage...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now he's attaching the steel chain-hooks to the four corners of the steel grate...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now he's pulling on a rope, straining to hoist the whole rig into the air. It lifts slowly from frame: body, needles, wires and all...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIGH WIDE ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and we get our first spectacular look at Frankenstein's gloriously low-tech and stupendously arcane lab. The Creature dangles below us from the ceiling-hoist, lying full-length and horizontal on its steel grate, spinning slowly, thick copper wires trailing from its arms and legs, rib cage and neck, armpits and groin. The copper cables trail upward, coil along the ceiling like garden hose to provide necessary slack, meander down the wall to culminate in a splendiferous array of galvanic batteries, steam engines and generators.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frankenstein reaches slowly up, fingertips straining toward the ceiling as if worshipping the creation revolving endlessly above his head in a perfectly-described circle not at all unlike the Da Vinci...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And he grabs the lever on the platform and pulls to start it spinning, with a mighty heave, he sets the whole thing gliding in motion, CAMERA TRACKING FASTER AND FASTER as he rolls it along the ceiling track through the lab, passing table after table of desiccated leftovers and discarded scraps, LIGHTNING BLAZING through the windows to mark his way with wild and sinister shadows...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and he yanks the platform to a stop over the copper sarcophagus. Amniotic fluid steaming and murky within. He positions the platform, unties the rope, lowers the Creature down and down, lower and lower, sinking into the vat, the steel grate a perfect fit in size and shape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Faster now, moving furiously. Reaching into the murk, unhooking the chains. Arraying the copper wire through air- tight guide holes. Spinning on his heels and reaching up, grabbing hold of the upper shell of the sarcophagus also suspended from the ceiling, stunningly heavy, gleaming with reflections and secrets. CAMERA ROCKETS DOWN on Victor as he swings the upper shell into position, lowers it into place with a THUD-CLANK! Working the wing-nuts on the bolts, spinning frantically, tightening them down, sealing the sarcophagus air-tight. Faster now. Faster.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The frenzy builds and the CAMERA GOES WILD, rocketing, zooming, gliding, spinning the audience on its ear:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frankenstein. Turning up the heat on the burners. Cooking the copper from below. Double double, toil and trouble.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frankenstein. Gazing through the thick glass portholes checking on his creation drifting in the murk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frankenstein. Whipping up the galvanic batteries, supercharging them with steam generators. Watching as they send voltage humming and throbbing through the copper cables along the ceiling beams. Building up a charge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frankenstein. Gazing at his gleaming handiwork. LIGHTNING painting his features into a twisted mask. Hand on the switch. Ready to rev it up and throw the throttle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Over it goes. WHAM! Overdrive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The body convulses violently in its copper womb as the first jolt of electricity hits. THUNK-THUNK-THUNK! Blazing with energy and arcane light, fingers of light throbbing through the portholes, sparkling, glittering, seeking.
</DIRECTION>

Frankenstein races to the sarcophagus. A long glass tube, two feet in diameter and ribbed with steel, gets lowered on a boom and rammed into a hole, collate spun tight, inner dam wrenched out like a Polaroid plate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches up and grabs holds of a pull-chain, fingers going knuckle-white on the wooden handle. One hard yank. A dump- tank is released, murky water cascading down the glass tube. And here's the final perversion, the ultimate icing on this twisted cake: the copper sarcophagus is literally a womb, with the giant glass tube serving as a massive gleaming phallus down which come pouring dozens of electric eels, wriggling and streaming like huge black sperm...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EEL POV (IN THE TUBE)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...rocketing down the tube, slithering and squirming, faster and faster, racing into the sarcophagus, seeking out the creation in the murky womb-fluid, lashing at the hapless gray flesh, zapping it again with high-intensity voltage. The Creature convulsing, thrashing, jerking from side to side, raising its head against the top, mouth gaping open and shut, jaws snapping with electrical surges.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frankenstein's face appears at the porthole, peering in, watching his dark seed fertilize his unholy child.

</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
A huge bony hand slaps against the porthole, fingers clawing and spasming against the glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FRANKENSTEIN jerks his head back, stunned. The fingers are scratching. He turns, runs to the electrical rig, shutting the whole thing down. It cycles off, whining into silence
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE SARCOPHAGUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and the body relaxes, shutting down with it, going limp and lifeless in the murk, spasms trailing off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FRANKENSTEIN stares at the sarcophagus. Realizing his creation has stopped moving. Nothing now. He sags to his knees, utterly devastated at the loss of his dream. Nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It was all for nothing...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE SARCOPHAGUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...And The Creature opens its dim yellow eyes, aware. Its mouth goes wide, teeth bared in a silent scream as it tries to breathe and finds nothing in its lungs but fluid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FRANKENSTEIN is wrapped in his despair, face cradled in his hands. A SOFT TAP. He glances over his fingers. Thinking he imagined it. No. There's another tap. And another.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see it in his eyes. Sheer joy and stunned exultation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Triumph and wonder unbelievably sublime. A bare whisper:
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's alive. It's alive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
And then hell breaks loose: Massive convulsions wrack the sarcophagus, damn near shaking it off its cradle. THUMP- THUMP-THUMP! Pounding from within. Head ramming against the inner lid. He races over, frantic, fingers fumbling on the wing-nuts, spinning them loose, trying to free the drowning man within. He unscrews the final bolt, reaches for the rope to hoist the lid away...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and the lid launches itself across the room, propelled from below with rocket-booster force. The massive copper shell goes hurtling/spinning/cartwheeling across the lab, demolishing an amazing array of equipment in its path, and thunders massively off the wall in an explosion of masonry and splintering coat rack. Victor's greatcoat goes flying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. Frankenstein is frozen. Staring at the roiling surface of the amniotic fluid as it settles. An eternity passes in the space of a heartbeat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Creature erupts from the vat like a vision from Hell, thrashing and gagging. Murky fluid cascading in all directions. The Creature seizes Victor by the shirtfront, trying to pull itself from the vat, slipping and sliding like an epileptic in a bathtub full of oil, damn near dragging Victor in, eels leaping and frothing and crackling with electricity. Victor screaming, trying to pull away, trying to break the Creature's grip...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and the whole thing tips over. Victor reels back, falling as the vat SLAMS to the ground, cascading its murky contents, washing the Creature limply across the floor like a body tossed from the ocean, eels flipping and flopping, snapping electrical discharges into the air. Victor scrambles back, slipping and sliding on the amniotic muck, desperately jerking his legs away. He finds his traction and scrambles to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Creature is grasping and crawling toward him. Flopping and jerking. Gripped by seizures and convulsions. Vomiting murky liquid as his lungs heave grotesquely to dispel the fluid. Swiping the air with palsied hands. Malfunctional.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VICTOR stands dripping fluid and goo, chest heaving, staring down at the Creature, not quite able to believe he was midwife to this ghastly birth. Softly:
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What have I done?
	</DIALOGUE>

The Creature lunges to its knees, grasping him, clutching his clothes, pawing him.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	LET GO OF ME!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Victor can't break free. Panicking. He snatches a hammer from a nearby table and brings it down on the Creature's head. THUD! Again and again. Beating the thing down, pounding it into submission. The Creature finally collapses, sliding down Victor's legs, curling up like a fetus, twitching and jerking in its own afterbirth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Silence now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A ghastly tableau: Victor stands in the middle of his ruined lab with his creation moaning and twitching at his feet in a dying heap. A FLASH OF LIGHTNING silently bathes the room, jerking wild shadows across the walls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Victor steps over the Creature. Dazed. He drops the hammer. It clatters to the floor. He stops to jot a final entry:

INT. VICTOR'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

The wee hours. Rain pattering desolately on the roof. Victor sleeping. Wrestling with troubled dreams. Through a crack in the bed curtains, we see the bedroom door slowly creak open, throwing a twisted spill of light. A shadow appears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Entering. Shambling and gliding across the floor. Silent and furtive. Creeping toward the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PUSHING SLOWLY IN on Victor. Moving into close-up. Sleeping.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unaware. The shadow falls across his face. Beat. His eyes fly open. An intake of breath. Paralyzed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sensing the presence. Feeling the shadow. Working himself up to something. Perhaps a scream. He can stand it no longer, thrusts out his arm, jerks the curtain aside...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and the Creature is there, Looming like a specter of death. Naked. Beseeching. Dull yellow eyes trying to understand. Victor lurches from bed, sends a nightstand and vase CRASHING to the floor. The Creature circles, seeking him, threatening to cut off his path to the door.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>

He darts past the thing, careening out into the lab. The Creature whips around, unsteady for a moment, then follows him with surprising speed.
</DIRECTION>

INT. LAB - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Victor races through the lab with the Creature hobbling behind, trying to catch up. Victor hurling lab equipment, tipping shelves in its path, anything to slow it down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Victor rips the door open, lunges through, slams it in the Creature's face. The Creature presses against the wood with pathetic little moans, begging not to be left alone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sinks to the floor. Abandoned. Shivering with cold. Sees Victor's greatcoat where it fell. Grabs it. Drags it over. Shrouding himself.

Victor races into the downpour, soaked to the skin in seconds, mind racing. He needs a plan. He presses on.

Victor races back into the storm. Searching. Slogging grimly on. Lashed by the wind and rain. Mocked by the lightning. He'll never give up. Not until he finds the thing and takes back the life he gave it. He dwindles from view, vanishing into the gale as we

EXT. ALLEY - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gray and drizzly. Heaps of wet garbage. Crawling rats. There's a shifting, heaving motion. The vermin scatter as the waking Creature peers at the world from beneath the greatcoat like a frightened child peering from under a blanket. Lost and confused.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He scrabbles through the garbage for something to eat. He finds a rotted scrap, chews it anxiously. Ravenous.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO FERAL DOGS appear, grizzled denizens of the city's gutters and back-alleys, peering with insolent eyes. Watching him eat. Assessing his potential as a threat. The Creature stares ingenuously back. Not knowing to be afraid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lead dog curls his lips back with a guttural SNARL. The Creature draws back sharply with a fearful MOAN. That's all it takes. The dogs are on him, snarling and snapping, the food torn from his hands. The dogs dart away, growling and fighting over the scrap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Creature is left whimpering and shaken. He pushes to his feet and hurries in the opposite direction, legs bare and pale beneath the swirling greatcoat, clutching his collar against the cold. He hears a distant CLANGING.

EXT. TOWN SQUARE - DAY

<DIRECTION>
...and emerges into the square as ANGLE WIDENS. There's a fair amount of activity. People are still leaving the city, though the earlier flood has thinned. Some citizens are still trying to go about their normal lives. VENDORS are calling out, selling food. The Creature moves through the square, unnoticed, just another figure mingling with the flow. People trudge along, eyes downcast, miseries great, paying little attention.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Creature pauses, sniffing the air. An aroma draws him to a vendor's stand. Loaves of bread are laid out. He hunches down to smell one, picks it up, bites off a chunk. Chewing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's good. A bigger bite. Snatching up more.

The Creature glances up. The VENDOR'S WIFE is within arm's reach, breath catching in her throat at the sight of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mouth gaping. Too stunned to scream.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Creature cradles the loaves to his chest, terrified she's going to take them away. He remembers his recent experience with the dogs and decides to try out the lesson he learned: he curls his lips back and snarls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's rewarded with a PIERCING SHRIEK. The Creature jumps back, startled. This wasn't the desired effect. The woman SCREAMS like she'll never stop. He turns to run away...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and plows right into the stream of refugees. He goes sprawling, scraping his knees bloody, still clutching his loaves. Confusion all around. People converge angrily. A ROUGH MAN grabs his hair, jerking him upright...
</DIRECTION>
<ROUGH_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stupid bastard!
	</DIALOGUE>

...and the Creature staggers to his feet before them, whimpering to protect his food, showing his face to all. Screams and panic. The Creature whips around, seeing horrified faces on all sides...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's the cholera! He's the one been spreadin' the plague!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...faces which turn into an angry mob, glaring sheer hatred. Somebody hits him in the face with a heavy stick, spinning him to the ground, loaves of bread scattering. They surround him, hitting, flailing, throwing stones. He tries to crawl, whimpering for them to stop.

The Creature finds himself hoisted into the air, falling back onto a sea of hands, kicking and screaming as the mob sweeps him across the square like some pagan sacrifice. He gets tossed onto the hard cobblestone in a thrashing heap, scrambles to his knees as the crowd surrounds him. He's wailing with terror now, long inhuman howls of fear. Men start flinging lamp oil, spattering him, blinding him. A torch is lit, swung toward him. Feel the heat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Creature lunges to his feet, panic and terror complete bulldozing through the crowd to get away from the torch, bowling people over, scattering them in all directions. He breaks free, hobbling wildly across the square, greatcoat billowing. The mob streams after him, thirsty for blood, hurling rocks and sticks.

The Creature is weeping as he runs, bleeding from his many cuts and bruises. He turns a corner, collapses against a wall to catch his breath. He can hear them coming, shouting. They'll be here any second.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sees a death cart heaped with bodies. He hurls himself up on the cart to conceal himself among the putrefying corpses. The crowd streams past the mouth of the alley. The death cart WORKERS appear, heaving another corpse onto the cart, gaping fearfully at the confusion. They scramble into their seats, snap the reins. The cart rattles off as we

Elsewhere in Ingolstadt. Death carts and devastation. This part of town was hit hard. Bodies are heaped in gutters, stacked along the walls. People are huddled in doorways, quaking with sickness and pestilence. CART WORKERS move among them, faces shrouded with kerchiefs and burlap masks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WORKER #1 moves down a row of the sick and dead, shaking them to see which is which, his face hidden behind heavy burlap. He pauses, seeing Victor unconscious against the wall, pale and covered with filth, shaking with fever. The worker's eyes widen. Stunned. He calls over his shoulder:

A death cart rattles past, bearing its load. PAN WITH IT to reveal a scene utterly Dante-esque. Here's where the dead are brought to be burned en masse. Fires are burning. Smoke is drifting in thick clouds, obscuring the sky. Soot is drifting like black snow. BODIES are dumped into a slit- trench, rolling and tumbling in heaps. Barrels are kicked over. Streams of oil come pouring down, splashing and soaking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the corpses moves, heaving the others aside. The Creature gazes around, terrified once again at the smell of oil. He knows what that means. He pushes free, clambering over bodies, desperately trying to scramble from the trench, loose soil crumbling under his fingertips...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE LIP OF THE TRENCH

...as WORKERS prepare to light the blaze. A MAN turns toward the trench with a burning torch... And then the Creature erupts from the trench of dead bodies right before big eyes, The man SCREAMS. The Creature SCREAMS even louder, cowering back. The man hurls the torch. The Creature ducks as it goes spinning over his head into the trench.

WA-BOOOM! A massive wall of flame punches sky-ward. The Creature whirls, stunned at the searing heat, arms thrown up in horror. He flees, scattering the workers as he goes, running from this ghastly place of flames and death...

The Creature comes blundering into view. On the move. He knows not where. Just away, He arrives at a pond. Water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's thirsty. He scrambles to water's edge, starts lapping it up with his hands. He pauses, noticing his broken reflection. The water settles and his face comes clearly into view. He throws his hands up and SHRIEKS, terrified at his own reflection...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and then he realizes it's him down there. He stirs the water with his fingertips to make sure. He reaches up, touching his face, utterly horrified at the sight of it...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and utterly heartbroken. He drops his face into his hand and weeps helplessly. BARKING DOGS in the distance. He looks up, thinking they're after him. A moan of grief. He pushes to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRACKING THE CREATURE faster and faster through the trees, running from this world he's been born into. Gasping for breath. Crashing through branches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The BARKING draws closer. He hurls himself into a thicket, scrambling to hide himself, covering himself with dead leaves. Panic. Exhaustion. Mortal terror. He flinches as something comes CRASHING through the brush nearby. The legs of a DOE come into view. Staggering. Falling. Thrashing down into a cushion of dead leaves. Two arrows protrude from her heaving side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A tiny FAWN stumbles into view on ungainly legs, mouth open, frothing with exhaustion and terror. Waiting for his mother to rise. Her thrashing grows weaker. Dying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Creature moans at the sight. The fawn turns, meets his gaze. An extended beat. A rush of empathy. The Creature reaches out. The fawn takes a few hesitant steps toward him. The BARKING draws closer. HUNTERS shouting. The Creature's fingertips make contact with the fawn...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A pack of the biggest, nastiest Staffordshire terriers you've ever seen throw themselves HOWLING AND SNARLING onto the doe, savaging her like whirling dervishes, The Creature lets out a SHRIEK, snatches up the fawn as he lunges to his feet, crashes off through the foliage with the fawn cradled to his chest. The dogs take off after him.

DOLLYING THE CREATURE

Finally the water starts to settle. He manages to lash out and secure a handhold. He pulls himself up, clambering over the rocks and staggering onto firm soil. He collapses to his knees, dripping water and heaving for breath. He lowers the fawn away from his chest, joyous at their escape... only to realize the small animal is limp and lifeless in his hands.

The Creature pauses, hearing FAINT MUSIC drifting on the breeze: the lovely flute-like sounds of a recorder. He slogs to the crest of a ridge. There's a small house in the valley below. A peasant dwelling. Smoke drifts from the chimney. That's where the music comes from (a simple and plaintive rendition of our movie's WALTZ/LOVE THEME).

The Creature approaches cautiously. Furtive. He eases to a window, catches a glimpse inside, draws back. Listening. The tune ends. We hear the pleasant murmur of VOICES. FOOTSTEPS come clumping across the floor. The Creature reels back and dives around the side of the house as the door unlatches and swings open. FELIX exits, a poor man trying to scratch an honest living from the soil. He heads in the same direction as the Creature...

He crawls to the trough and squeezes in among the pigs. They jostle, but he jostles right back, wanting his fair share. He laps up the slop with his fingers, dribbling it down his chin. Not much on taste, but it's edible.

<DIRECTION>
He stops, hearing the recorder MUSIC again, turning toward the sound. He follows it, crawling back into the darkest recesses where the sty adjoins the wall of the house. He places his eye to a chink between the logs...
</DIRECTION>

...and sees GRANDFATHER playing the instrument near a fireplace of glowing embers. The Creature shifts for another view, sees the family preparing the table for dinner. Felix and his wife MARIE are helped by their children, MAGGIE AND THOMAS, ages 6 and 8

...that nobody but GRANDFATHER hears, He pauses to gaze blindly toward the wall, eyes milky with cataracts, wondering what it might have been. Probably nothing. He lets the children lead him toward the table. The meal is brought from the stove and ladled out.

The Creature eases back to the chink in the wall, smelling it from here. A string of drool spills from his mouth. It's humble fare, not very appetizing, but it looks like a feast compared to pig slop...

INT. PIGSTY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Creature and the pigs are sleeping in a heap. He rouses, scattering them, crawls to the slats of the sty. Felix is returning wearily from the fields with a large basket on his back. The Creature moves to his chink in the wall to see Felix enter the house and dump the basket out for Marie. A pathetic array of potatoes and turnips.
</DIRECTION>
<FELIX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not much to look at. Even less to eat. I don't how we're going to get through the winter with this yield.

He sinks into a chair, weighed by worry. She moves to comfort him, cradling his head to her breast. He returns her embrace, drawing strength. A tender, gentle moment. The Creature watches, puzzled and empathetic, deeply moved by her sympathy. Felix gathers himself, wipes his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<FELIX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll see if I can scratch a few more out of the ground.

He hoists the basket and exits. The Creature turns to watch Felix trudging back toward the fields.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FIELD - DAY
</DIRECTION>

Felix digs for potatoes, tilling as he goes. Back-breaking work. Thomas provides what help he can. Some distance away, Maggie and Grandfather are tending the cow. ANGLE SHIFTS to reveal the Creature watching from the brambles...

<DIRECTION>
The Creature stirs, hearing movement within the house. He scurries to the slats of the sty and peers out. All the baskets from the tool shed are stacked to overflow before the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens. Felix steps out and trips on a basket, sprawling to the ground in a torrent of potatoes and turnips. He sits up, gazing in wonder.

A sliver of warm light spills through the chink in the wall.

The Creature looms into frame, busily munching a raw potato.

INT. VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

Snow is drifting outside the tall dormer window. We find Victor at his desk, reading a letter:
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"...but it's been so long since I've heard from you. Remember the vow we took the night you left? You must be honest with me if your feelings have changed. Answer for the sake of our friendship, and both our future happiness."

</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A woman like that is far too rare to be taken lightly.

Victor ponders the letter. He lays it next to the locket, pulls out a sheet of paper and quill, begins to write...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PIGSTY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Creature observes another lesson. Six more words are chalked on the board. Thomas is struggling with the first:

<THOMAS>

And then, amazingly, the Creature finishes the word before Thomas does:
</DIRECTION>
<CREATURE>

</CREATURE>
<THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>

</THOMAS>
<MARIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very good! Maggie. Try the next.

Now the Creature beats Maggie to the punch:

	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>
<THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maria! Look! It's snowing!
	</DIALOGUE>
</THOMAS>
<DIRECTION>
The children crowd to the window. The Creature turns, peering through the slats. White flakes drift magically down. The door flies open, the children pour out. The adults appear in the doorway:
</DIRECTION>
<MARIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maggie! Thomas! You'll catch your death!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIE>
<GRANDFATHER>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's right about that.

<DIRECTION>
Before she can react, he grabs her by the waist and drags her shrieking out into the snow. Before you know it, a wild snowball fight ensues. Screams and laughter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CREATURE watches his family cavorting in the snow, having the time of their lives. His face lights up with a smile. Softly:

Bright sunshine sparkles off a fresh carpet of snow. Felix and the children are heading out, spirits high. Felix has his axe and a coil of rope slung over his shoulder.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. WOODS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRACKING Felix and the children. They're laughing and joking, the kids playful and giggling. The Creature shadows them, looming and darting among the trees, along for the excursion. Happy as a kid himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maggie and Thomas hurl themselves to the ground, thrashing their arms and legs in the snow. They jump to their feet and hurry to catch up with Felix. The Creature peers out, amazed to see two snow-angels in the powder at his feet. Up ahead, Maggie points to a 6-foot fir tree.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That one! It's the most beautiful tree I've ever seen!

Felix shrugs off his coil of rope and starts chopping.

INT. PIGSTY - NIGHT

The Creature gazes through the chink in the wall, face lit up with wonder. Inside, the tree is a dazzling vision of ornaments and light. The house is filled with joy and laughter. Grandfather plays his recorder by a roaring fire
</DIRECTION>
<CREATURE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Most beautiful... tree...

</CREATURE>
<DIRECTION>
The kids go dashing across the room. The Creature shifts to the slats as the door opens, throwing a spill of warm light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The children set something out in the snow. Maggie calls out into the darkness:
</DIRECTION>
<MAGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Merry Christmas!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
The door closes. The Creature creeps from his sty, scurries closer to investigate. He finds a covered plate topped with a glittering red silk flower as decoration. The slate board is jammed in the snow. On it is chalked a child's rendering of a glowing angel and a message:
</DIRECTION>
<CREATURE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For the... Goood Spirr-rit... of the... Forr-rest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>
<DIRECTION>
He snatches up the plate, scurries around the side of the house, and hunkers down near the tool shed with his prize.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He plucks the red silk flower, enchanted by it, tucks it gingerly into an inner coat pocket. He uncovers the plate to reveal a wonderful array of Christmas cookies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's not sure what they are, but they don't smell half bad.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He picks one up and bites into it. He pauses, stunned, eyes going wide as saucers. A whine builds in his throat. He starts huffing air as he chews, mouth gaping, mind thoroughly blown. Screw potatoes and turnips.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOUSE - MORNING

The children race out the door to find the plate empty. And a big snow-angel waiting for them in the yard,

The Creature watches the family clustered around the fire. Marie reads a book aloud:

	...with particles of heavenly fire, the God of Nature did his soul inspire... and pliant still the ethereal energy which wise Prometheus tempered into paste...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIE>
<DIRECTION>
The Creature leans back into the shadows, grappling with the concept of book. He reaches into the pocket of the greatcoat, and pulls out what's been there all along:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Victor's Journal. So that's what this is. A book. He unwinds the thong, riffles the pages. Letters fall, scattering from the pages. He picks one up by the corner, turns his head this way and that. Slowly:

The Creature studies Grandfather for a time. The old man waits. Finally starts to play again. The Creature finds a spot to listen. He opens Victor's journal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PUSHES SLOWLY IN as he puzzles over it...
</DIRECTION>

INT. PIGSTY - DAY

He turns the page and discovers his own rough likeness: it's Victor's sketch of his patchwork man. The rendering includes suture marks where the pieces were joined.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Creature gazes for a long time. His finger traces the penciled suture-line where an arm joins the torso. Eyes going wider. Revelation slowly dawning. No. It can't be. it's too horrible to conceive...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and he drops the journal, clawing at his coat in a surge of panic, wrenching it away to reveal his arm... And the massive suture scars joining his shoulder to his torso in an exact match to the drawing. He throws his head back in an animalistic PRIMAL SCREAM, face twisted in a mask of utter horror, Munch's painting made flesh...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE WOODS

...and his scream echoes across the countryside, Felix turns from chopping wood. His family gathers, eyes wide, listening to the sound trail off. Softly:

The house is distant below. Felix and his family are heading out across the fields now sparse with snow, herding the cow before them. Only Grandfather is missing.

The gentle MUSIC of the recorder drifts up from the house.

ANGLE WIDENS to reveal the Creature hunkered on a hill. Watching. Waiting. The family dwindles in the distance.

For the first time, we actually see the inside of the house from a perspective other than through the chink in the wall.

Grandfather is by the fire, playing his recorder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Creature's face appears at a window. Peering in. He ducks from view, appearing at another window. Making sure the house is otherwise empty. He vanishes again. The door swings silently open. His figure fills the doorway.

Grandfather stops playing. Silence.

The Creature pauses. Trying to get the words out. And the door swings open. The Creature whips his head. There stands Maggie. Eyes going wide. Breath catching in her throat. She lets out an ear-splitting SHRIEK! The Creature throws himself on the old man's lap, clutching him, pleading:

Felix bursts in, shoving Maggie aside, hell breaking loose in screaming, hollering chaos: Marie trying to get the children out of the way, Felix throwing himself on the Creature to rip him off the old man, the Creature sprawling to the floor, the old man shouting, the children SHRIEKING, Felix snatching, up the fireplace poker and swinging it down, again and again, trying to kill the thing...

EXT. WOODS - DAY

A snowscape. Stark trees. A figure in a greatcoat. Head bowed with misery. Leaning against a tree. Trying to catch his breath. Can't. Crying too hard. He sinks to his knees, hands clutched bitterly to his heaving chest. Wondering why the anguish doesn't stop his heart in mid-beat.

A realization. He pulls the little red silk flower from the inside pocket. It lies glittering in his huge, misshapen palm like gentle magic. Or hope. Yes.

We hear furniture CRASHING, glass SHATTERING, shelves being ripped from walls. A faint glow kicks up. Flames rise within. The Creature exits with a flaming torch, spins back to watch. He has new possessions: an armload of books jammed in a satchel, some extra clothes on his body, the old man's recorder jammed in his belt.

A HOWLING WIND whips up, billowing his coat and hair, fanning the flames even higher. He raises his torch, HOWLING along with the wind, reflected fire seething in his eyes, exulting as the house is consumed...

Sunlight streams through the dormer window. Birds twitter on the ledge outside. The trees are in bloom. Victor stands dressed and ready to go, taking one last pensive look around at the now-empty garret. Henry appears:

<HENRY>

	Our carriage is here.

EXT. INGOLSTADT CITY GATES - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bustling with activity. Hopeful. A traffic snarl is jammed up in both directions, waiting to get in and out of the city. People, carriages, wagons, goods. We find Professor and MRS. KREMPE saying goodbye to Victor and Henry:
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_KREMPE>
<DIRECTION>
(watching the gates)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Such a terrible winter. I'll praise God to see those gates open again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_KREMPE>
<KREMPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll have all your things sent on. They should arrive soon after.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Victor nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's been a rough time, lad. For us all. But if you'd like to come back and finish out your final term once university re-opens...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KREMPE>
<DIRECTION>
A ROAR goes up from the crowd. The gates are finally opening as SOLDIERS swing them aside. The traffic starts to flow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Victor turns back to Krempe, nods gratefully.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Professor. For everything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Krempe is flustered as Victor gives him an awkward hug.
</DIRECTION>
<KREMPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Write and let us know you've arrived safely.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KREMPE>
<DIRECTION>
Victor breaks the embrace. He and Henry clamber into the carriage. Softly:
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take me home, my friend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Henry signals the DRIVER. The reins snap. The carriage lurches away, easing into the flow of traffic as we

EXT. FRANKENSTEIN ESTATE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
William, now 10, comes charging up the steps with a small package under his arm, nearly bowling over Mrs. Moritz as he sails past her hollering his head off:
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	HE'S COMING HOME!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PARLOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Willie careens into the parlor, where Elizabeth and Justine are entertaining FRIENDS.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Elizabeth! Justine!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<DIRECTION>
Father enters, trailed by HOUSEHOLD STAFF.
</DIRECTION>
<FATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's all the fuss? Why are you shouting?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER>
<WILLIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's coming home! Tonight!

</WILLIAM>
<ELIZABETH>

<ELIZABETH>

(swept with relief)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank God.
	</DIALOGUE>

Willie thrusts the package into her hands. She hesitates
</DIRECTION>
<FATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Open it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER>
<DIRECTION>
Willie scrambles to bring her the letter opener. Elizabeth lays the package down, slits it open. Willie peers in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elizabeth pulls the locket out to the admiration of all. She presses the catch. The locket pops open to reveal Waldman's miniature oil painting.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's Victor!

</WILLIAM>
<JUSTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
(takes the locket)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He looks so handsome.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUSTINE>
<DIRECTION>
Elizabeth pulls out the letter. Apprehension and hope. She begins to read. The others watch her. Waiting. Her face lights up, blinking back tears. She remembers to breathe.
</DIRECTION>
<FATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What does it say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER>
<ELIZABETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let this locket be a token of the vow we took the night I left.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's coming home to marry me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIZABETH>
<DIRECTION>
Instant pandemonium and joy... except from Justine, whose heart quietly breaks. Father and the others ROAR with approval while Willie jumps and shouts:
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Married! The two of you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<FATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Brilliant! I knew it! Ever since you were children!

(softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

She hands the locket back. She slips quietly from the room, unnoticed by the others...

INT. ENTRYWAY - DAY

and hurries down the hall, fighting back tears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RESUME PARLOR as Elizabeth is swept up in congratulatory conversation. Willie grabs the locket, admiring it:
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Elizabeth? Can I take this to show Peter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<ELIZABETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Willie, it's not a toy for your friends.

</ELIZABETH>
<WILLIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll take extra special care, I promise! Pete's never seen what Victor looks like! He'll admire it enormously!

</WILLIAM>

Willie's so solemn and earnest that Elizabeth has to smile.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIZABETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't dawdle. It'll be dark in a few hours.

</ELIZABETH>
<DIRECTION>
The boy takes off like a shot. Father throws his arm around

Elizabeth, announcing to all:

</FATHER>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FRANKENSTEIN ESTATE - LATE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Geese scatter as Willie comes racing across the grounds. He clambers over a low fence, heading into the miles of wooded acreage behind the house. His favorite shortcut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - LATE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Willie hurries/dawdles along as kids do, the precious locket clutched in his hands, admiring it. He can't get over the fact that his brother's finally coming home.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pauses, hearing FAINT TONES carried on the breeze, eerie and flute-like. A recorder. Curious, he follows the sounds further and further into the woods...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. POND - LATE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and comes into view of the pond. There's a FIGURE sitting half-concealed among the tall reeds, gazing off across the water and playing his delicate wind instrument with oddly- pleasing dissonance (again, a simple variation of our familiar WALTZ/LOVE THEME.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Willie draws closer. Curious. Not wanting to intrude, but listening to the music. The figure in the reeds still hasn't noticed him...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...And then his head abruptly whips around, An ogre right out of a storybook. Willie's eyes go wide. The locket drops from his fingers into the dust. The boy turns and runs as the monster in the reeds lunges to its feet:
</DIRECTION>
<CREATURE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait! Don't be afraid!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>
<DIRECTION>
The boy keeps running. The Creature comes shambling up from the pond, still calling after him. He picks up the dropped object. As he rises, he finds himself staring at the locket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the small painting it contains. Victor Frankenstein. He raises his gaze after the fleeing boy. Maybe Willie does have reason to be afraid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Creature starts after him, locket clenched in his fist, teeth grinding in greater and greater rage. Eyes wild.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THEIR FEET go pounding through the brambles and brush. The terrified boy. The pursuing monster. Faster and faster...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FRANKENSTEIN KITCHEN - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Whirling with activity. Mrs. Moritz supervises the staff.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elizabeth and Justine are helping with the preparations.

Justine turns with a platter, collides with one of the kitchen staff. Carrots go flying.

Justine sees genuine concern. She softens:

Father enters with Claude. Both men worried.

</FATHER>
<ELIZABETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is he not back yet?

<FATHER>

	Claude rode over there to see if held lost track of time. They say he never arrived.

He rushes to gather the men. Elizabeth gazes off. Wind kicking up. Night approaching. Almost too dark to see.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COUNTRYSIDE/WOODS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A massive search in progress. People are scouring the fields on horse and on foot, shouting Willie's name. Elizabeth enters frame, calling out:
</DIRECTION>
<ELIZABETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	WILLIE!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIZABETH>
<DIRECTION>
LIGHTNING dances on the horizon. A storm approaching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WOODED AREA - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
The stark black silhouettes of tree trunks bisect the frame in foreground as Justine approaches from the fields, lantern held high...
</DIRECTION>
<JUSTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	WILLIE!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUSTINE>
<DIRECTION>
...and one of the "tree trunks" turns out not to be. It darts abruptly across frame with a billow of flapping greatcoat, Justine enters the woods. A FLASH OF LIGHTNING sends shadows skittering among the trees...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROAD TO MANSION - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...And the storm is now a raging downpour, TILT DOWN to reveal a coach clattering through the rain.

<DIRECTION>
INT. COACH - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Victor is peering out the window flap.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There! Look!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Henry cranes to look. A LIGHTNING FLASH stutters the mansion briefly to life a few hundred yards down the road,
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quite a place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Henry.

</VICTOR>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For what?

</HENRY>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This. My home. My family.

<DIRECTION>
(softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If not for you, I'd be dead in a burial pit somewhere.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Henry smiles, squeezes his shoulder. The carriage lurches violently, tossing them forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COACH - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Victor jumps from the coach as the DRIVER wrestles his rearing horses under control and points. Victor turns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elizabeth stands in the downpour like a ghost. Drenched to the bone. Weeping from the depths of her soul. Holding Willie in her arms. The boy's arms hang limp, his head dangles back. Victor starts forward, stunned, unable to comprehend, running faster and faster...
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Elizabeth?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
...and now others are converging on the scene, dark screaming figures in the storm. Victor reaches her first as the others crowd around in a panic of confusion, crushing and jostling as she collapses into Victor's arms, all of them cradling Willie, and then Father is there, shoving his way through, -- seeing his dead boy and collapsing in the muck with a SCREAM, and suddenly Henry is there shouting for the men to lift him and everybody is scrambling and screaming as we

INT. MANSION - FATHER'S BEDROOM - MORNING

Silence. All we hear now is the SOFT TICKING of a clock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Henry tenderly ministers to Father, who lies gravely ill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PARLOR - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elizabeth is sitting. Elbows crossed. Holding herself together. Face ashen. Dazed. Still in shock. Mrs. Moritz is nearby, looking much the same. Eyes swimming with tears.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_MORITZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir. I'm terrified for my girl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MORITZ>
<VICTOR>

	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll organize another search now that it's light enough. We'll find her, Mrs. Moritz, I promise.

Henry comes downstairs. He and Victor confer in whispers then approach Elizabeth. Victor crouches before her.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIZABETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is Father's outlook?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIZABETH>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am cautiously hopeful. With quiet and proper care he may eventually regain some or most of his strength.

Victor squeezes her hand. Comfort and strength.

<ELIZABETH>

There's a KNOCKING at the front door.

INT. ENTRYWAY - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Victor opens the door. POLICEMEN hover outside. Faces grim.
</DIRECTION>
<POLICEMAN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Frankenstein. We've apprehended the murderer. Not five miles from here, hiding in a barn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POLICEMAN_1>

INT. JAIL CELL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Victor is led in by policemen. The JAILER unlocks the cell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Victor enters as the men depart. Victor is alone, staring at a FIGURE huddled in the corner, pooled in shadow. We get the impression of long, dangling hair. The figure stirs...
</DIRECTION>
<FEMALE_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Victor?

She rushes to him, throws herself into his arms. He reacts stiffly, not at all sure he wants her touching him.

<JUSTINE>

	Is it true? What they say about Willie? Is it true?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUSTINE>
<VICTOR>

She dissolves into tears. Barely able to breathe.

Justine pauses. Stunned. Her eyes on his. Here's the deepest betrayal ever experienced. Her heart turns to ash.

INT. COURTROOM - DAY

The courtroom is packed. Justine sits accused. An older KITCHEN MAID is on the stand.
</DIRECTION>
<KITCHEN_MAID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I found her sobbing her eyes out. Poor thing, I said, what's all this? And she spilled her heart to me about Master Victor. How she'd always loved him, and now he was coming home to marry mistress Elizabeth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KITCHEN_MAID>
<DIRECTION>
A MURMUR sweeps the courtroom. Victor and Elizabeth share a stunned glance.
</DIRECTION>
<KITCHEN_MAID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She cried and cried about the beautiful locket he'd sent. How she wished it was hers. She swore me never to tell a soul.

	That was before the boy went missing, a'course.

INT. COURTROOM - DAY

Victor is on the stand:

<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I always viewed her with brotherly affection. I had no idea of her feelings for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<PROSECUTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rejection can be a powerful wound. People have been known to do uncanny things.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROSECUTOR>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But to commit so ghastly and terrible a crime against a child she loved?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Victor pauses, gnawed by some vague intuition. He looks to Justine. She gazes back, her feelings hidden. Softly:

	<DIALOGUE>
	I believe she would sooner have strangled the life from her own body.

INT. COURT ROOM - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Justine is now on the stand:
</DIRECTION>
<JUSTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. I took refuge in the barn. Wouldn't you? Lost in the storm? Freezing and wet? I was exhausted and could search no longer.
	</DIALOGUE>

<PROSECUTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And is it true, Miss Moritz, that you love Victor Frankenstein? That your heart was broken?

	Answer the question. Do you love Victor Frankenstein?

Her gaze wanders to Victor, eyes locking on his. Stares back, trapped.

<JUSTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have always loved him.

<PROSECUTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it also not true that you murdered his brother William in a misdirected crime of passion?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROSECUTOR>
<JUSTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Murder Willie? In my heart, he was our child. Victor's and mine. Such a thing could never have entered my mind.

</JUSTINE>
<PROSECUTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you have claimed. Yet you have no explanation for this.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(holds up the locket)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The locket last seen in the hands of the poor murdered child was found hidden in your dress the morning following the murder. The locket you so coveted.

<DIRECTION>
(leans close)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did it come to be in your possession?

	I have no knowledge of that.

EXT. FIELD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A PAIR OF FEET drop heavily in frame. THUMP-CRACK! A shoe flies off. The CROWD gasps. Mrs. Moritz collapses WAILING to the ground. Elizabeth drops to her side to comfort her. Victor just stands staring. ANGLE WIDENS to reveal Justine dangling from the noose, neck broken, hands bound and feet still twitching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SAME FIELD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another eerie echo of before: a storm is raging. The body dangles from the scaffold, lashed by wind and rain. Victor looms from the darkness, staring.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then a massive white hand thrusts into frame and grabs his shoulder. Victor whirls and finds himself staring up into the last face he ever expected to see again, the hideous necrotic features bathed in a purple/white GLARE OF LIGHTNING. He SCREAMS as the Creature lashes out, grabs him by the coat, draws him breathlessly closer, inch by inch, eyeball-to- eyeball, grinning his awful rictus grin. Softly:
</DIRECTION>
<CREATURE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frankenstein.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>
<DIRECTION>
Victor is speechless with horror. The Creature raises his arm, pointing with an impossibly long and bony finger. Look there. Victor does. LIGHTNING dances in the sky, illuminating Mont Blanc with a crackling halo of electricity... and then the Creature is gone, vanishing like a shadow in the darkness. Victor falls gasping. The awful truth dawning. He rises, gazing at the scaffold, horrified.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh God. Oh God! No! NOOOOOOO!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Screaming now, rushing to the scaffold, throwing his arms around the innocent girl dangling there, sliding down, sinking to his knees, weeping helplessly:

<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh God. Justine. Forgive me.
	</DIALOGUE>

INT. MANSION - STUDY - DAWN

MANSION - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Victor is bundled in a rough coat, packing final supplies on a horse held by Claude. Elizabeth is at his heels.

<DIRECTION>
A lone horse and rider appear, on his mission of revenge...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Victor ascends the mountain. The mountain is brutal and unforgiving. Victor dismounts, leading his horse onto the glacier. A bitter wind blows...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They plod on. Searching. Magnificent rugged vistas unfolding before our eyes. Primeval and vast...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The horse suddenly spooks. Victor calms him. Staring. Is that a figure down there? He shades his eyes against the cutting sleet. Somebody in the distance. Down there on the snow field. A tiny speck. Watching him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The figure starts running, leaping across the ice with great bounds. Right toward Victor. Victor wrenches the carved box from the saddle bag. The horse bolts. Victor drops to the snow, throws open the box, frantically snatches up the pair of revolvers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He glances up. The figure is gone, vanished in drifts of white. Victor rises with a revolver in each hand, cocks the flintlocks of both, turning slowly around. Gazing at the rocks and crags. Searching.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	WHERE ARE YOU?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
He hears nothing but his own voice echoing back... and then FEET CRUNCHING through the snow. He turns. The Creature is running toward him across the glacier with inhuman speed, greatcoat billowing like huge dark wings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Victor raises the first pistol. Hesitates. As frightened and angry as he is, a small part of him pauses to admire the achievement of actually having created life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls the trigger. BOOM! A huge flash of powder, an eruption of smoke. The Creature dodges the shot, still coming. Victor raises the other gun. BOOM! Another flash of smoke. Still the Creature comes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Victor. Frantic. Manually spinning the cylinders, cocking, firing. BOOM! A miss. BOOM! Another miss. Spinning. cocking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Firing. BOOM! BOOM! Spinning. Cocking...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...And the Creature is on him, slapping the pistols clean out of his hands. The guns sail through the air, spinning off across the ice. Victor panics, turns to run... And slips over the edge of the precipice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Victor falls SCREAMING, arms and legs windmilling through a 30-foot drop... and slams bodily into a snowdrift. He looks up. The Creature is peering down... and leaps over the edge to follow, sailing through the air to land before him in a cat-like crouch. He pulls Victor from the snow and sends him sliding across the ice with a mighty heave...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ICE CAVE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...right into the mouth of an ice-cave, Victor comes tumbling and sliding down the entrance, spinning and careening to sprawl heavily to the cave floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Winded. Battered. Barely able to move. He glances up to see the cave filled with possessions. Books. Provisions. Extra clothing. The embers of a fire burn low. There is even a rough attempt at furnishings in the form of a few crates.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A huge shadow fills the cave entrance. The storybook ogre is coming home to his cave, breath huffing like a steam engine. Victor scrambles back terrified, pressing into a corner as the Creature enters...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...but the Creature merely crosses to the fire and hunkers down. He tosses a few more sticks on the flames. Pause.
</DIRECTION>
<CREATURE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come warm yourself if you like.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You speak.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<CREATURE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I speak. And read. And think... and know the ways of Man.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been waiting for you. Two months now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did you find me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
The Creature grabs Victor's journal off the "shelf." He unwinds the thong, the letters spill out.
</DIRECTION>
<CREATURE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The letters in your journal. That and a geography book.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(picks up a letter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your Elizabeth sounds lovely.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kill me and have done with it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<CREATURE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kill you? Hardly that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then why am I here? What did you want with me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<CREATURE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	More to the point, why am I here? What did you want with me?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off Victor's look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What does one say to one's Maker, having finally met him face to face? Milton gave it voice.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(grabs a book, thumbs to a certain page)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay to mould me Man? Did I solicit thee from Darkness to promote me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine words from a child killer. You who murdered my brother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<CREATURE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your crime... as well as mine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How dare you. You're disgusting and evil.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<CREATURE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Evil?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(scurries closer)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you believe in evil?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see it before me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<CREATURE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not sure I believe. But then I had no one to instruct me. I had no mother... and my father abandoned me at birth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>
<DIRECTION>
He draws closer still. Intimate. Turning his head this way and that. Puzzling at Victor's face. Softly:
</DIRECTION>
<CREATURE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Were the dying cries of your brother music in my ears?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>
<DIRECTION>
He raises his hand before Victor's eyes, bony fingers curling to clutch an invisible throat. Victor is petrified
</DIRECTION>
<CREATURE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I took him by the throat with one hand... lifted him off the ground. And slowly crushed his neck.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(emotion growing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That poor, innocent child died in my grip... because all I could see was your face... and all I could feel was my rage. And when I let him go, he fluttered to the grass like a sparrow...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>
<DIRECTION>
FLASHBACK INSERT: FIELD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Creature gazes down at Willie's body. He stares at the hand that committed the crime as if waking from a dream.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tears welling. Overcome with shame and horror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He falls to knees in the middle of the vast field, his wail echoing across the countryside as he weeps over the boy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RESUME ICE CAVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Victor stares in horror as the Creature relates his story with tears shining in his monstrous eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<CREATURE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Later, when they were searching, I followed the pretty lady who got lost in the woods...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>
<DIRECTION>
FLASHBACK INSERT: - BARN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Justine is asleep in the hay. Haggard, wet, exhausted. The Creature looms over her, a monstrous shape backlit by the lightning, gazing on her beauty. His hand reaches down, hovering reverently, wishing to caress the swell of her breasts at the neckline of her bodice ...
</DIRECTION>
<CREATURE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She was so lovely. I longed to touch her... and seek her sympathy...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>
<DIRECTION>
The locket drops from his hand to dangle in his fingers. He lowers it, tucking it gently away in her pocket
</DIRECTION>
<CREATURE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...but I simply returned the object which had triggered my crime, hoping in some small way to atone...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>
<DIRECTION>
RESUME ICE CAVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now tears are shining in victor's eyes as well.
</DIRECTION>
<CREATURE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You gave me these emotions, but you didn't tell me how to use them. Now two people are dead. Because of us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>
<DIRECTION>
Victor is crushed by remorse. A sob escapes him.
</DIRECTION>
<CREATURE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, Victor? Why? What were you thinking?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There was something at work in my soul which I do not understand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<CREATURE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What of my soul? Do I have one? Or was that a part you left out?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(spreads his hands)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who were these people of which I am comprised? Good people? Bad people?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Materials. Nothing more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<CREATURE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're wrong. Do you know I knew how to play this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs up the recorder, plays a brief snatch of melody.
</DIRECTION>
<CREATURE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In which part of me did this knowledge reside? In these hands? In this mind? In this heart?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And reading and speaking. Not things learned... so much as things remembered.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Trace memories in the brain, perhaps.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<CREATURE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stolen memories. Stolen and hazy. They taunt me in my dreams. I've seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her. Whose woman was this? I've seen boys playing, splashing about in a stream. Whose childhood friends were these?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(soft, intense)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who am I?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>
<VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(hollow)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<CREATURE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then perhaps I believe in evil after all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>
<DIRECTION>
The Creature moves off. Victor is emotionally exhausted
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What can I do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<CREATURE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is something I want.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A friend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Friend?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<CREATURE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A companion. A female. Like me, so she won't hate me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like you? Oh, God, you don't know what you're asking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<CREATURE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do know that for the sympathy of one living being, I would make peace with all.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine. And rage the likes of which you would not believe. If I cannot satisfy the one, I will demonically indulge the other. That choice is yours.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off his look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're the one who set this in motion, Frankenstein.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And if I consent?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<CREATURE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'd travel north, my bride and I. To the furthest reaches of the Pole, where no man has ever set foot. There we would live out our lives. Together.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No human eye would ever see us again. This I vow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>
<DIRECTION>
PUSHING SLOWLY IN on Victor. Considering it. Beaten.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MONT BLANC GLACIER - NEXT MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Victor is calming his skittish horse as the Creature looms into view. Victor turns. The Creature tosses Victor his journal. Victor hesitates, jams it into his saddlebag.
</DIRECTION>
<CREATURE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Soon?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. I want this over and done with.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<CREATURE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be waiting. And watching.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>
<DIRECTION>
And with that, the Creature turns and scrambles back down the nearly-vertical cliff face, leaping from crags and boulders with superhuman agility. Victor watches him vanish from sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MONT BLANC - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Victor descends the mountain, heading back to civilization.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FRANKENSTEIN ESTATE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Victor walks his horse toward the house. Elizabeth rushes out to meet him with Henry and Claude. Victor hands off the reins to the STABLEBOY and embraces Elizabeth tightly.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIZABETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought I'd never see you again!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIZABETH>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm all right. I'm safe,
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened up there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't find what I was looking for.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did you find?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
Victor glances over. Claude has pulled the Collier pistols from the saddlebags and caught a strong whiff of powder.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These have been fired.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At shadows. My nerves got the better of me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Victor walks on toward the house with Elizabeth
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GARDEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and we find them in discussion by the fountain:
</DIRECTION>
<ELIZABETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What sort of task?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIZABETH>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not something I can explain now. Perhaps someday.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<ELIZABETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What of our marriage? Victor, we've had so much tragedy. I want this family to live again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIZABETH>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So do I.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<ELIZABETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We need each other now, I need your comfort and strength, not separation and solitude.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIZABETH>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A month at most, that's all I ask.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(draws close)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Elizabeth, please. Things have not yet resolved. I must take steps to see that they do. For our family's sake. For our sake.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(caresses her face)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are life itself. We shall seal our vow. The moment I am done.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
He leans forward to kiss her... and pauses, hearing the distant MUSIC of a recorder echoing from the hills...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEDROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Victor sits at bedside, holding Father's hand. The old man is a weak and frail shadow of his former self.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must regain your strength to preside at our wedding... and spoil your grandchildren later on. These are duties you cannot shirk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Father smiles faintly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Victor squeezes his hand, whispers:
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're all safe now. I promise
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MANSION ATTIC - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Murky and dark. Victor enters, yanks a dusty curtain off a window to let in some daylight. He picks up a pry bar, approaches a stack of crates as if facing an old adversary. One in particular is quite large. He rams the bar into the wood, prying it open... and CAMERA PUSHES IN to reveal a dull gleam of copper lurking within the packing straw.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God forgive me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
MONTAGE:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Victor assembles his equipment, recreating the lab; bolting together the sarcophagus, now resting in its cradle. Hanging the huge glass tube, adjusting the boom. Installing the ceiling tracks and hoist mechanism. Playing out the copper wire along the ceiling beams. Hooking up the galvanic batteries and generators. Testing the electrical circuit with goggles and thick gloves, getting a huge cascade of sparks...
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I prayed never to see these again...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
Victor turns. Henry stands in the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever they are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
Henry enters, runs his hand over the gleaming surface of the sarcophagus, circles toward Victor.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I won't bother asking what or why. You wouldn't tell me anyway. I just hope you know what you're doing...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(draws close)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...because if this is a repeat of Ingolstadt, I won't be around to pick up the pieces.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PUSHES PAST to the Da Vinci print on the wall, contact points still daubed with red...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA DRIFTS among the tombstones to reveal an eerie sight:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOMEONE hunched in a grave, digging madly, dirt flying. We hear the THUNK of a shovel hitting wood
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COFFIN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and the lid wrenches aside to reveal the Creature. He peers down at us, almost close enough to kiss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FRANKENSTEIN MANSION - ANGLE FROM ROOF - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Creature nimbly climbs the outer wall, fingers grasping the brickwork, a dark shape slung over his shoulder. He pauses as a PAIR OF STABLEHANDS pass far below. He pulls himself onto the roof, crosses the gables, and pushes open a dormer window. We see Victor inside as it swings open. The Creature enters with his prize...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ATTIC - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and the mottled corpse of Justine Moritz flops onto the table before us.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TILT UP TO:
</DIRECTION>
<CREATURE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>
<DIRECTION>
Victor stares down in utter horror. Her cold, dead face. Blue lips already beginning to shrivel. Purple, sunken eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Knowing that she loved him. Knowing it's his fault she's dead. He can barely get the words out:
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why... her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<CREATURE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Her body pleases me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>
<DIRECTION>
That's it for Victor. He turns away, stomach heaving. It's all he can do to keep from throwing up.
</DIRECTION>
<CREATURE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Materials, remember? Nothing more. Your words.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>
<DIRECTION>
Victor hesitates, pulling himself together. Softly:
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My words.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
He turns back, forcing himself to examine the body, trying not to view it as someone he knows. He cradles the head, probing the back of the neck with his fingers.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The brain stem was destroyed by the hanging. We'll need another. The body looks like it will do, but some extremities are too decayed. They'll have to be replaced. The fresher the better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALLEY - RED LIGHT DISTRICT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Outside the back door of a rowdy tavern, we find a PROSTITUTE servicing a SAILOR in the alley: he's got her pressed against the wall, skirt hiked up. It's not long before he's finished. Off he goes, staggering back into the bar. She arranges her skirt, tucking the money away... and pauses, noticing a TALL FIGURE in the shadows. Staring. She approaches with her best saucy smile:
</DIRECTION>
<PROSTITUTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Want some yourself? Or just like to watch?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(draws close)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you say, lover? I can make it good for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROSTITUTE>
<DIRECTION>
The Creature leans into the light, clamps a massive hand to her mouth. His other arm wraps around her waist, pulling her off the ground. She gazes up, eyes wide, screams muffled in his palm. Softly:
</DIRECTION>
<CREATURE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know you can.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>
<DIRECTION>
And he wrenches his arm, snapping her spine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ATTIC - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dead prostitute lies staring up, dried blood staining her mouth. TILT UP to Victor gazing down in horror.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<CREATURE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A brain. Extremities.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This was not taken from a grave.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<CREATURE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What does it matter? She'll live again. You'll make her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I draw the line.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
The Creature lashes out and drags Victor across the table.
</DIRECTION>
<CREATURE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You will honor your promise to me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>
<VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(through gritted teeth)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will not! Kill me now!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<CREATURE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That is mild compared to what will come. If you deny me my wedding night. I'll be with you on yours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>
<DIRECTION>
The Creature vanishes out the attic window into the night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Victor is left gasping for air, staring at the dead prostitute. The full horror sinking in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ATTIC STAIRCASE - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Victor slams the attic door, securing it with a massive padlock. He hurries down the steps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GRAND BALLROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Victor and Elizabeth, intensity flying:
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Not tomorrow, not next week, Marry me today.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<ELIZABETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why the change? What about your work?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIZABETH>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was misguided and pointless. Is your answer yes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<ELIZABETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIZABETH>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll leave this afternoon, right after the ceremony. Pack only what you need.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<ELIZABETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does this have something to do with that man you saw?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIZABETH>
<VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(hesitates)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. We're in danger here. Every moment we stay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<ELIZABETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Victor, tell me why! Trust me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIZABETH>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do. But you must trust me for now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEDROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small ceremony has been hurriedly organized at Father's bedside. The old man holds Elizabeth's hand. Softly:
</DIRECTION>
<FATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is not... the grand wedding... I had hoped to give you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER>
<DIRECTION>
He releases her hand, giving the bride away. She takes her place at Victor's side. Henry stands as best man. The PRIEST faces them:
</DIRECTION>
<PRIEST>
	<DIALOGUE>

Elizabeth gets in the coach. Claude clambers up to the driver's seat armed with a rifle, ready to pull out. EIGHT MEN on horseback provide armed escort. Victor addresses the men staying behind, all of whom are also armed:
</DIRECTION>

CRIES of assent.

Victor pulls Henry aside:
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you sure you'll be all right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, don't worry. I'll look after your father. You look after her.

</HENRY>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be back as soon as I've got her far away and safe. We'll hunt this fiend down together.

<DIRECTION>
A quick embrace. Victor leaps into the coach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE FROM FATHER'S BEDROOM WINDOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The coach clatters up the road, trailed by the eight horsemen. Those left behind scatter across the courtyard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Henry turns and walks back toward the house. ANGLE WIDENS to reveal the Creature at the window. In the bed behind him, The old man stirs, opening his eyes
</DIRECTION>
<FATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Victor?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER>
<DIRECTION>
...and sees the Creature turn toward him. Father's eyes go wide as his final stroke is triggered. His life ends with a prolonged death-rattle... and a soft exhale. The Creature reaches down, closes his eyes. A tender gesture.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LOUD GASP. The Creature whirls. There stands the priest, dropping his tea to the floor. The Creature sweeps across the room, presses him against the wall.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. LAKE GENEVA - DUSK

A magnificent sunset bathes the mountains as storm clouds roll in. A ferry is crossing the lake, moving away from us, rippling the water. TILT DOWN to reveal...

Claude trotting to the window of the coach.

A big chalet nestled in the woods by the lake. The storm is raging. Claude and his men are positioned at the entrances.

<VICTOR>

	Make sure you keep your pistols dry

INT. BRIDAL SUITE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Victor enters to find the room aglow with dozens of candles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elizabeth turns from the fireplace, her body silhouetted through the sheer white nightgown.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIZABETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're soaking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIZABETH>
<DIRECTION>
She approaches, peels off his coat. Victor stares at her, awe-struck. She sees the look in his eyes, crosses her arms demurely... then laughs at her own modesty.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIZABETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Brother and sister no more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIZABETH>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now husband and wife.

</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
He strokes her bare shoulders with his fingertips.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I remember the first time I ever saw you. Crossing the floor of the grand ballroom with my parents at your side. So beautiful even then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<ELIZABETH>
<DIRECTION>
(a whisper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have been waiting for this ever since.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIZABETH>
<DIRECTION>
She leans up and gives him a kiss that would melt glass, triggering the sexiest seduction imaginable...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...kissing, caressing, Victor stripping off his wet shirt, CAMERA DRIFTING around them in slow circles, candles spinning like a fever that's been building for a lifetime... and now onto the bed. Magnificent and canopied. Kneeling together, bodies touching, hands seeking, mouths joining...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elizabeth lying back, beckoning for him to love her. Victor sinking down, running his hands up her thighs, peeling up the nightgown, making her shudder with desire...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and a SHOT FIRES. Victor jerks up. He can hear SHOUTING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He rolls off the bed, snatching up both pistols lying primed and ready on the nightstand.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIZABETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Victor!

EXT. CHALET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Victor sails past the GUARD at the entrance, brandishing his pistols. The men converge, shouting in the rain:
</DIRECTION>
<GUARD_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I saw him in a flash of lightning! He vanished toward the lake!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD_2>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get after him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
Several men race off in pursuit. TILT UP from Victor and Claude... as a FLASH OF LIGHTNING reveals the Creature clinging in the branches above their heads with a malevolent smile. He scurries silently up, further and further into the tree... closer and closer to the balcony.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BRIDAL SUITE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elizabeth. Tense and waiting. A shadow looms across the balcony... spilling through the French doors... onto the floor... a bony hand reaches for the latch...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The doors burst open on a crust of wind and rain, Elizabeth spins as candles blow out all over the room. The Creature enters, massive and unseen, gliding in shadow. Softly:
</DIRECTION>
<CREATURE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't bother to scream.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CHALET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

The men come running back from the lake. They stop before Victor and Claude.
</DIRECTION>
<GUARD_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We lost him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD_3>
<DIRECTION>
And GUARD #4's eyes drift up:
</DIRECTION>
<GUARD_4>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are those open?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD_4>
<DIRECTION>
Victor spins, gazing up. Breath catching in his throat. The French doors are swaying in the wind.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Elizabeth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BRIDAL SUITE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elizabeth watches, transfixed, as the huge shadow moves inexorably toward her. Her eyes dart toward the door. She makes a break for it. He catches her halfway across the room, spinning her around by the arm. Her face is lit by the light of the fireplace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Creature pauses, stunned at her beauty. A moment passes between them. She senses the softening in his heart. She peers at him, trying to understand. Realizing:
</DIRECTION>
<ELIZABETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't want to hurt me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIZABETH>
<DIRECTION>
He averts his gaze, shamed by her beauty.
</DIRECTION>
<CREATURE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're more lovely than I could ever have imagined.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>
<DIRECTION>
FOOTSTEPS come pounding up the stairs. A HEAVY CRASH of men throwing their shoulders at the door...
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	ELIZABETH!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
...and it changes back in an instant, The Creature snarls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She tries to wrench away. He spins her around so he won't have to look at her in the light, casting her face in shadow. He cooks his arm back and plunges his fist toward her chest with pile-driver force...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LANDING (OUTSIDE ROOM) - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and her SCREAM is cut short. The men give one last mighty rush at the door...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BRIDAL SUITE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and they burst in just in time to see Elizabeth cascade back onto the bed, her chest a massive red stain. The Creature whips toward them, fist glistening with blood...
</DIRECTION>
<CREATURE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I keep my promises.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>
<DIRECTION>
...and he races across the room as the men OPEN FIRE, shredding the walls to splinters with an explosive fusillade of shots. But the Creature is too fast. He hits the leaded window head-on with the force of an anvil...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CHALET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and goes sailing out into empty space in a hurricane of shattering glass. He drops 40 feet to the grass below and vanishes like the breeze, greatcoat whipping into darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BRIDAL SUITE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Victor rushes to the bad and lets loose the most PRIMAL SCREAM OF ALL. He sweeps his limp, murdered bride into his arms, cradling her to his breast, screams trailing off into wracking moans and sobs of despair:
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh God... he took her heart... he took her heart from me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CHALET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The men make way as Victor carries his dead wife through the downpour. He puts her in the coach. Dazed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The coach comes racing through the storm, the horses in a frenzy, faster and faster.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MANSION - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Victor whipping the coach veers to a wild stop. Victor jumps down, gathers up the body, and mounts the steps. Henry appears, rushing out into the rain. Victor goes right past him...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MANSION - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and carries Elizabeth through the silent halls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ATTIC - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door swings in. Victor stands dripping. Holding Elizabeth. Gazing at the gleam of copper...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MONTAGE:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And we launch into the final throbbing madness. Victor hacking and chopping. Discarding pieces. Sewing the creation, yanking the catgut tight. Ramming the needles deep. Hoisting the body in the air. Slamming the sarcophagus lid, tightening the bolts. Powering up the galvanic circuit, throwing the switch. Screaming at God as the LIGHTNING FLASHES and the body convulses. Wind and rain sweeping through the lab, battering a window open and shut, open and shut. Lowering the glass tube, ramming phallus into womb. Releasing the eels, huge black sperm squirming and writhing toward the spasming egg The body. Convulsing. Lashing. Screaming in the copper womb. Hair whipping in the fluid...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Victor shuts down the machinery. He opens the tank and reaches into the fluid with his thick rubber gloves. He pulls out his creation, cradling the head and neck as one would cradle a newborn infant's...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...And wipes the muck away with his glove to reveal Elizabeth's face, Massive suture marks bisect her neck and collarbone where pieces were joined. A whisper:
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Live.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Her eyes flies open as consciousness hits, mouth gaping to draw air but finding fluid in the lungs. She erupts, thrashing in the vat. He clutches her tight, pounding her back to start her breathing, calming the convulsing Creaturess with soft murmured words of tenderness and love as her lungs heave violently to dispel the fluid...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He lifts her gently out. Wipes off the muck as she shivers and shakes, spasms easing off. Cleansing her face. Clasping her hand in his. Comfort and strength...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Helping her to her feet. Jerky and unsure. Lean on me.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Replacing the sheer nightgown on her scarred and naked body, draping it... and finally, exhaustingly, tilting her chin up with his fingers to gaze into her eyes. A whisper:
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say my name.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Blank. Dazed. Stunned. Not a flicker of recognition.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Elizabeth. Say my name. Say you remember. Say my name.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing. He leans forward... and kisses her dead lips.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gentle as a sigh. A flicker in her eyes?
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must. You must.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Maybe his imagination. Still whispering:
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say my name. Say you remember.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
And slowly... ever so slowly... she raises her bony white hand before her eyes... staring at it... trying to puzzle it out... its meaning... perhaps the vaguest shred of recognition... and the hand continues to rise... creeping slowly toward his shoulder... and coming to rest there. He smiles, blinking back tears...
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. I'll help you remember.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
And he takes her other hand in his. At first it's imperceptible... just the slightest motion, perhaps nothing, perhaps just a shift of balance... and then it grows into the vaguest sway... and tears are glistening in Victor's eyes as she begins to move. Lurching. Faltering. Unsure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
You must lead, Victor. The lady will always look to you for guidance, so your steps must be sure and strong.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trace memories.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A waltz.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And here we are treated to the most sweepingly romantic and hair-raisingly demented image of the film: Frankenstein dances with his dead bride, showing her the way, begging her to remember, please remember, and now our WALTZ/LOVE THEME really comes back to haunt us as the MUSIC SWELLS, incredibly lush and deranged, dissonant and echoing through Victor's head, music only he can hear...
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...one-two-three, twirl-two-three.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
...and the worst part? The very worst thing of all? There on the shelf. A large formaldehyde jar. Justine's severed head. Watching them through the glass with dead, sightless eyes. Watching them dance. Still a wallflower? No. She's finally finishing her dance with Victor... most of her, anyway. Under the circumstances, it'll have to do...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and the waltz goes on, madder and madder, sweeping in glorious circles as a dazzling array of LIGHTNING bathes them in its wild, jittering spotlight, shadows careening across the walls, INSANE MUSIC swelling louder and louder, climbing higher and higher, reaching toward its crescendo with jagged glass claws...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and it all screeches to a stop as the door bursts in. Music echoes abruptly away into silence. Nothing now but rain and distant thunder. In the doorway:
</DIRECTION>
<CREATURE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's beautiful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's not for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<CREATURE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sure the lady knows her own mind. Doesn't she? Let her decide the proper suitor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>
<DIRECTION>
The Creature raises his hand. Beckoning. She takes a faltering step. Drawn to him.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Elizabeth, no!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she turns, puzzled)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say my name.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Her face reflects horror and shame, like a brain-damaged child who's wet the bed. She knows she's supposed to remember... but can't remember what remembering means.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They both motion to her. Murmuring. Begging. She's caught between them, pulled like a diaphanous rope in a tug of war.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Please... come with me. Please... remember. She finally tilts toward the Creature. Gazing into his eyes. Studying his face. Fingertips tracing his massively scarred flesh. A beat. A frown. A puzzlement. This isn't right. People don't look like this. They're not stitched together out of pieces of flesh like a patchwork.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at her own hands. Dead and white. Not even hers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One belongs to Justine. Another to a prostitute, suture scars marring the wrist. She looks down at herself. The dead, sagging breasts. The body that isn't hers either. Realization creeping into her eyes. Realization and horror. Turning to Victor. Why do I look like this? What's happened to me? Oh God, what's happened to me?
</DIRECTION>
<ELIZABETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vic... tor?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIZABETH>
<CREATURE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...no...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>
<DIRECTION>
...and she lets out a SHRIEK, a banshee wail from the deepest pits of hell. Screaming at them both. Screaming at herself. She goes berserk, trying to claw her flesh away, trying to find the real Elizabeth underneath the horror, trying to peel it away, clawing at her face. Trying to claw out her own eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Victor lunges to restrain her, screaming himself, veering toward final utter madness like strings snapping on a violin. The Creature grabs him, hurls him aside.
</DIRECTION>
<CREATURE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	GET AWAY FROM HER! SHE'S MINE!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	SHE'LL NEVER BE YOURS! SHE SAID MY NAME! SHE REMEMBERS!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Yes. She remembers. Not much, but enough. She breaks away from them as they grapple, still SHRIEKING as she sails across the room, tipping furniture, equipment flying...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...over straight to the kerosene lamp, snatching it up before they can stop her.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	NO!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
She spins to face them, holding them breathlessly at bay with the threat of the lamp, twitching from one to the other. But it's not just the lamp, it's the look of sheer loathing in her eyes. Loathing for them for what they've done to her... loathing for herself for what she's become.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It turns out the lady does know her own mind. She wants no part of it... or them. Decision made. She crushes the lamp in her bare hands, drenching herself in a cascade of kerosene. WHOOOOSH! She goes up like a blazing matchstick and darts past them, still SHRIEKING, still trying to claw the dead flesh away, pulling off giant flaming pieces of herself as she careens out the door and down the steps, Victor and the Creature racing after her...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UPPER HALLWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and she sails down the hallway, setting FIRE to everything she passes, SCREAMING for the final torment to end. She hurls herself over the railing, drapes catching ablaze as she plummets to the floor far below. A pillar of flame leaps up on impact.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VICTOR AND THE CREATURE face each other as flames sweep the walls, combusting the upper hallway into a raging tunnel in Hell.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You killed her! You killed her!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
He hurls himself at the Creature, who backhands him spinning down the hallway, sprawling to the floor. The Creature gazes down at his Maker one last time...
</DIRECTION>
<CREATURE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We killed her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>
<DIRECTION>
And then vanishes through the smoke and flames.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FRANKENSTEIN ESTATE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The once-magnificent estate lies in smoldering ruin beneath a merciless gray sky. Charred beams and drifting smoke are all that remain to mark the passing of a noble family.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Victor stands gazing at the house. A windswept, hollow man Bundled in a rough coat. Flintlock rifle dangling at his side. Henry moves into frame some distance behind. Softly:
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Victor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
No reaction. For a long moment it seems Victor hasn't heard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He rouses as if from a trance, turn and walks to his pack horse. The animal stands saddled and ready.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to mount up, but Henry intercepts him with a restraining hand. Victor snaps a look as if seeing a stranger... and then his features soften.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All that I once loved lies in a shallow grave. By my hand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let it go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
Victor pauses, emotions swirling. Wishing he could grab the dangling thread of sanity Henry has offered... but knowing the thread is a bittersweet illusion. A bare whisper:
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should have been my father's son. He would have been so proud.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Victor abruptly heaves himself into the saddle and spurs his horse. Henry runs after him, shouting:
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	VICTOR! COME BACK!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
But Victor keeps riding without so much as a backward glance. The past is dead. Henry watches Victor until he's gone from sight, as Willie did so long ago...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MONT BLANC GLACIER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The solitary rider and his mount traverse the windswept glacier ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE CREATURE'S CAVE - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Victor slides down the entrance, rifle cradled. The cave is now deserted, all possessions gone, a scorched black spot where the campfire had been...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GLACIER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A panorama of snow. Pristine... save for the long trail of footprints stretching off before us.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Victor's face thrusts into frame, gazing at the craggy horizon, breath punching the air with billows of vapor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He slogs onward, following the tracks, leading his horse by the reins. Dwindling across the frozen landscape.
</DIRECTION>
<ARCTIC_VICTOR>

<DIRECTION>
INT. WALTON'S CABIN - TWILIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Victor lies in Walton's bed, sallow as a corpse, barely able to speak, drained now of everything.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A year now I've followed him. Perhaps more. Only to arrive at this place. Tired. So very tired. I never did find... whatever it was... I was looking for... and neither will you, my friend.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off Walton's look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Value life above ambition... or those glittering prizes you seek will crumble to dust in your fingers... as they have in mine.

<DIRECTION>
(reaches out feverishly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See your loved ones again. I cannot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Walton takes Victor's hand, lays it gently back to his chest. Softly:
</DIRECTION>
<WALTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rest now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTON>
<DIRECTION>
Victor is silent. His breathing shallow. Walton just sits And waits...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SLOW DISSOLVE marks the passage of Walton's long vigil...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Victor's eyes flutter open as if staring at something unseen. Perhaps, the faces of those he loved. The eyes glaze. A peaceful death. Walton rises. Puts on his heavy coat to ward off the chill. Exits the cabin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NEVSKY - ON DECK - TWILIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grigori is leaning on the gunwale, staring off across the ice. His coat is open. Walton joins him. Surprised at how warm it is. He holds up his hand, testing the breeze.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A warming wind.

	<DIALOGUE>
	He died. Raving about phantoms. He was mad, poor devil.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gather a detail. Have the body removed from my cabin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTON>
<GRIGORI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aye, Captain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRIGORI>
<DIRECTION>
Grigori moves off to gather help. Walton turns and heads back to his cabin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WALTON'S CABIN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walton enters... and freezes at the sound of SOFT WEEPING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He can't see the bad from here. Could it be the dead man? He glances down. Wet footprints lead across the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He eases forward. The tiny bed chamber comes slowly into view. A DARK FIGURE is hunched and weeping at bedside, holding the corpse's hand. Walton is stunned.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTON>
<DIRECTION>
The figure swivels its head, revealing its face to the dim yellow light:
</DIRECTION>
<CREATURE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He never gave me a name.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>
<DIRECTION>
Walton hisses a terrified intake of breath. He lunges to the desk, slaps his hand on the pistol lying there. A frozen beat. Wondering if he should snatch it up. Eyes dancing with fear and speculation. The Creature makes no move. Unconcerned.
</DIRECTION>
<CREATURE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were with him at the end.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>
<WALTON>
<DIRECTION>
(finds his voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTON>
<CREATURE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was watching.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>
<DIRECTION>
Walton glances to the porthole, ajar and creaking in the breeze, chilled at the thought. The Creature returns his gaze to Victor.
</DIRECTION>
<CREATURE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I longed to be with him. But I wanted his final moments to have peace. I could see you were a friend to him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>
<WALTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is that to you? Evil as you are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTON>
<CREATURE>
<DIRECTION>
(swivels his gaze)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am as he made me. In his own image.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>
<WALTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You drove him to his torment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTON>
<CREATURE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And he drove me to mine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>
<WALTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then why weep for him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTON>
<CREATURE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you not? He was father. And mother. We fell from grace together. He from his God. I from mine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>
<DIRECTION>
The Creature gently strokes Victor's cheek. He reaches up with two fingers, closes the staring eyes. A whisper:
</DIRECTION>
<CREATURE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could we ever have forgiven?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>
<DIRECTION>
The question goes unanswered. The Creature rises, gliding in shadow to the door. Pauses.
</DIRECTION>
<CREATURE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've never been shown a kindness. Show me one now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>
<WALTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What kindness?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTON>
<CREATURE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Build for him a pyre. Light up the sky with his passing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>
<DIRECTION>
And then the Creature is gone, vanishing smoothly into the night...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ARCTIC - TWILIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crew of the Nevsky are on the ice, chopping up the fallen mast, axes rising and falling in waves...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ARCTIC - TWILIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The body of Victor Frankenstein lies on an impressive bier of wood, stacked and lashed. His body is wrapped in rough canvas, his face as dead and white as the ice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walton and crew stand facing the bier. Walton silently reads a passage from the Bible. Oily black smoke from a small campfire drifts past.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walton closes the book. Amens are muttered. Walton glances to Grigori and nods. Grigori moves forward with two other men. They begin dousing the pyre with lamp oil, soaking it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walton moves to the campfire, picks up an unlit torch. He dips it into the fire, igniting the pitch, turns. The men back away, preparing for the coming blaze...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and a dog starts howling on deck, others joining in. The men pause. Gazing across the ice. Dread seeping into their bones. There's a figure out there. Huge and humanlike in frame. Loping slowly over the ice. Approaching.
</DIRECTION>
<PILOT>
<DIRECTION>
(softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Christ.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PILOT>
<DIRECTION>
Grigori snatches up the rifle, shoulders it smoothly, cocks the flintlock. Walton glances over, pushes the muzzle skyward, denying his aim.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It has a right to bear witness.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTON>
<DIRECTION>
Grigori hesitates, nods. If you say so. The men grow more unsettled as the Creature draws nearer. Frightened muttering. Men start backing toward the ship.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stand fast. All of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTON>
<DIRECTION>
The men stand fast. The Creature stops some thirty yards out. A silent tableau on the ice. The men facing the Creature. Walton holding the torch. The pyre waiting for the kiss of flame. Walton moves forward...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and a THUNDEROUS CRACK is heard, The men whip their heads as a gigantic plate of ice goes spinning into the air some fifty yards away and comes crashing back down again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's like tectonic plates building pressure toward an earthquake: once it goes, it goes with terrifying speed and force: CRACK! Another eruption. CRACK! And another. CRACK!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ice cascading skyward.
</DIRECTION>
<OLD_SAILOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	THE BITCH IS BREAKIN' UP!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_SAILOR>
<GRIGORI>
<DIRECTION>
(whips toward Walton)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	TORCH THE DAMN THING!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRIGORI>
<DIRECTION>
Walton rushes forward. CRACK! The ice erupts before him. The torch goes flying. Walton sprawls flat on his back.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	BACK TO THE SHIP!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTON>
<DIRECTION>
The men don't have to be told twice. They're already in full retreat, scrambling for their lives. Ice is detonating for miles around as if pounded by artillery. Grigori helps Walton to his feet. The torch lies burning not ten feet away. A heartbeat of hesitation. Walton wondering if he should go for it. Grigori pulling wildly on his sleeve...
</DIRECTION>
<GRIGORI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	LEAVE IT!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRIGORI>
<DIRECTION>
...and then the matter is decided for them as a huge rift opens at their feet, running an explosive zig-zag course across the ice, separating them from the torch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They fall back to join the retreat, stumbling after the others, pursued by the ice dissolving at their heels.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CREATURE watches his last wish for Victor Frankenstein snatched away by God's whim and breaking ice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He starts forward. Behind him, a detonation of ice throws a massive fist into the air, creating a magnificent halo of cascading water and spinning fragments.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE NEVSKY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The first wave of fleeing men reach the ship, crowding to the drop-net for salvation, scrambling up the side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WALTON AND GRIGORI stumble along, closing distance to the ship. Walton glances back, amazed to see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CREATURE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
racing across the ice, making for the torch, teeth set in a wide grimace of effort. Detonations threaten to swallow him from all sides. Suddenly, things go from bad to worse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE NEVSKY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
breaks free with an enormous groan, heeling slowly over, triggering massive eruptions in all directions. The crew hang onto the drop-net for dear life. Several men plummet into the icy water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CREATURE is propelled by a detonation as if held stepped on a land mine, cartwheeling helplessly through the air to plunge headfirst into the water, huge plates of spinning ice crashing down after him. Gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WALTON AND GRIGORI are knocked flat as a fissure appears between them. Grigori, dazed, is lifted into the air on a teetering table of ice, desperately trying to scramble back but sliding forward nonetheless, rising up and up, a gaping maw of frigid water yawning wider and wider before him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walton grabs the back of Grigori's coat and tries to drag him off... but the coat is snatched from his fingers as the ice see-saws forward in a complete flip and slams Grigori thunderously into the drink.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	GRIGORI!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTON>
<DIRECTION>
THE NEVSKY finishes righting itself, swaying ponderously as she finds honest ocean beneath her hull. Some men are reaching the top of the net, hurling themselves over the gunwale to the deck. Those lower on the drop-net are helping their fellows from the water, hauling them to safety.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FRANKENSTEIN'S BIER is now corkscrewing in slow circles on its own ice floe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE TORCH is drifting on a chunk of ice. Still burning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE AT WATER LEVEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walton is on hands and knees, scrambling on shifting pieces of ice, thrusting his arms into the water, screaming:
</DIRECTION>
<WALTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	GRIGORI!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTON>
<DIRECTION>
The first mate breaks surface in the foreground, gasping and strangling for breath, face already turning blue, arms thrashing wildly, dragged down by the now-impossible weight of his own clothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walton strains to reach him, nearly going into the water himself. Grigori keeps thrashing and gasping. Dying. He's dying right in front of Walton's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	SOMEBODY THROW ME A GAFF!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTON>
<DIRECTION>
Too late. Grigori goes down for the final time, vanishing for good beneath the frigid water. Gone. Walton throws his head back with a bellow of anguish...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and Grigori breaks the surface again, rising slowly And impossibly from the water. arms and legs windmill against the air, propelled from below with nearly aulic strength. He gazes down in shock at the massive fist clutching his chest... and the arm that grows and grows, rising, lifting him up and up... and the hideous face that breaks the surface beneath him. The face of a nightmare.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Creature lunges hugely, hurling Grigori through the air right into Walton's arms. Both men go sprawling. Walton scrambles to his knees, makes eye contact with the Creature.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The monster is exhausted. Near his limit. Walton thrusts out his arm, fingers grasping to help.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Swim.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTON>
<DIRECTION>
The Creature swivels his gaze. The burning torch is drifting away. He looks grimly back to Walton. Walton beckoning to him. Come. Grab my hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Creature swims away, knifing through the water after the torch. Walton turns, drags Grigori gasping to his feet, helps him limp toward the Nevsky across the lurching ice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CREATURE struggles through the water, crushed and battered by ice floes on all sides. Going under.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WALTON AND GRIGORI slog grimly on across the disintegrated ice, knee-deep and nearly walking on water. They sink, finding nothing beneath their feet. Lines are thrown down and caught.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walton and Grigori are hauled from the frigid arctic water and hoisted up the side of the ship. The last ones aboard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BURNING TORCH is spinning slowly on its chunk of ice. Bony fingers break the surface of the water. A straining hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Creature's eyes rise from the murk. Bleary with exhaustion and cold. He seizes the torch. Raises it high.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Swims grimly on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ABOARD THE NEVSKY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crew bundle Walton and Grigori in blankets, both men shivering with exposure. Walton lurches to the gunwale, gazing off. The men crowd to his-side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CREATURE swims on, head barely breaking the water, torch held high to keep it burning. Relentlessly determined. This is the most grueling effort we've ever seen. Gasping and sinking beneath the surface...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and finally grasping with frozen fingers the ice floe upon which lies Frankenstein's funeral pyre. He hauls himself from the water. Moving now in a slow-motion litany of exhaustion. Climbing the pyre. Scaling the wood. Seeking the top. Never giving up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Creature joins his Maker atop the bier, straddling the wood, holding the torch aloft as if lighting his master's way to the Netherworld, Frankenstein's personal boatman across the River Styx. Frankenstein himself lies serenely at his creation's knees, content to be shown the way...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Creature turns his face to the sky, gulping air, spreading his arms wide in sublime triumph. Feeling the wind on his skin, the sleet on his face, the grim joy in his heart. Cold. So very cold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He glances at the torch burning low in his outstretched hand, pitch almost gone, sputtering and trailing smoke. He looks down. At Frankenstein. The oil-soaked canvas. The saturated wood. There's that smell. Yes. He scoops Victor up with his free arm and cradles him to his breast, as tender as a mother comforting a baby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WALTON AND THE CREW gaze in horror. Realization dawning:
</DIRECTION>
<GRIGORI>
<DIRECTION>
(SOFTLY)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't do it...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(screaming)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	FOR GOD'S SAKE! DON'T DO IT!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRIGORI>
<DIRECTION>
THE CREATURE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
turns his gaze one last time toward Heaven. Eyelids fluttering in near-religious ecstasy. Finding in these last moments the sympathy held so long sought. A whisper:
</DIRECTION>
<CREATURE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For God's sake... I will.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CREATURE>
<DIRECTION>
And he rams the torch into the pyre beneath him. White-hot ignition. Ultimate redemption. WHUMP! A massive BALL OF FLAME engulfs the bier, pushing a huge fiery fist into the sky. Blossoming. Roiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WALTON AND THE CREW gaze on in wonder and horror as:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CREATURE rides the burning pyre, a shrieking revenant wrapped in a caul of fire, screaming in the flames. Hair going up at a sizzling flashpoint. Cheeks billowing out, peeling back in the blast-furnace heat. Flesh cleansing from bone. Teeth charring and turning black. Still cradling Victor. Still screaming. waiting for the final torment to end. Perhaps it never will...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FRANKENSTEIN'S PYRE drifts off into the arctic twilight trailing a huge column of flame and smoke, inhuman screams echoing endlessly. Lost in the darkness and distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WALTON stands at the gunwale, his crew at his side. The borealis dances mysteriously on the horizon. Distant slivers of lightning kiss the world. Softly:
</DIRECTION>
<WALTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Home
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTON>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ARCTIC - TWILIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIGH AERIAL SHOT. An ocean of broken ice beneath us. The Alexander Nevsky heels gingerly about, corkscrewing through a slow turn toward the open sea as we FADE TO BLACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
