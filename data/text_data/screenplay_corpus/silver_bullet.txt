EXT. THE FULL MOON, CLOSE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It nearly fills the screen, swimming mysteriously in the warm late summer air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOUND: Crickets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAMERA PANS SLOWLY DOWN TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TRAIN TRACKS IN THE COUNTRY NIGHT - AND MOONLIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CREDITS BEGIN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A rail-rider comes chugging along the tracks. Aboard is ARNIE WESTRUM, a big man in a strappy T-shirt and chino pants. He is drinking beer.
</DIRECTION>
<ARNIE>
<DIRECTION>
(sings)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My beer is Rheingold the dry beer... Think of Rheingold whenever you buy beer...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARNIE>
<DIRECTION>
He drains the rest of his own bottle of Rheingold and tosses it to one side. Up ahead we see a switching point.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ARNIE throws the rail-rider into neutral, opens the toolbox on the back, and brings out a big five-cell flashlight. He shines it on the switch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He gets a crowbar from the toolbox, plus a big wrench, a pair of pliers, a hammer, and a pair of work gloves. He also gets another bottle of beer and sticks it into his back pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ARNIE jumps down and approaches the switch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CREDITS CONTINUE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ARNIE, AT THE SWITCHING POINT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He drops his tools, pulls on his work gloves, and trains the light on the switch for a moment. During this:
</DIRECTION>
<ARNIE>
<DIRECTION>
(sings)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not bitter, not sweet, it's a real frosty treat, won't you try, won't you buy Rheingold beer...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARNIE>
<DIRECTION>
He tries the switch. No go. It's frozen.
</DIRECTION>
<ARNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stuck tighter'n dogshit in a deep freeze!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARNIE>
<DIRECTION>
He takes the bottle of beer from his back pocket and fishes a churchkey from one of the front ones. He pops the cap and drinks deeply. He burps. Then he screws the half-empty bottle of beer into the cinders so it won't fall over. Then he picks up his crowbar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CREDITS CONTINUE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE RAIL-RIDER NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a SOUND of bushes shaking. Something comes out - something huge. It leaps limberly onto the rail-rider. It is a werewolf with greenish-yellow eyes. Tatters of clothes still hang from it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
What kind of monster, exactly? It is humanoid as well as wolfish... and when we learn who it is in its human form, we should be able to spot the resemblance at once...and kick ourselves for not knowing earlier.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It crouches there, huge and bushy and fanged and deadly, on the whole rail-rider.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CREDITS CONCLUDE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ARNIE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's working the crowbar into the junction point just as hard as he can. Swearing at it under his breath. Suddenly, both the tracks and the switch move.
</DIRECTION>
<ARNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hot damn! Now... a little oil...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARNIE>
<DIRECTION>
He turns back toward the rail-rider.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ARNIE, ARRIVING AT THE RAIL-RIDER NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<ARNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not bitter, not sweet... it's a big fuckin' treat...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARNIE>
<DIRECTION>
A NOISE - bushes rattling; cinders clinking and rattling. ARNIE looks around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE RAILS AND THE SWITCHING POINT, ARNIE'S POV NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing there. His bottle of beer stands by the litter of his tools.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ARNIE, AT THE RAIL-RIDER NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's rooting around in the toolbox, back to the switching point.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ARNIE'S BOTTLE OF BEER, CU NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hairy hand/paw closes around it - we see huge curved claws on that hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE WEREWOLF'S FACE, CU NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Glaring green-yellow eyes; a savage, beastial face which is still half human. That's all we see. The rest is in shadow. It opens its mouth and upends the bottle of beer. Foamy Rheingold begins gurgling down the werewolf's throat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ARNIE AT THE RAIL-RIDER NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He comes up with an old-fashioned oilcan, the kind with the long spout. He starts back to the switching point, waving the can.
</DIRECTION>
<ARNIE>
<DIRECTION>
(sings)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My beer is Rheingold the dry beer... Think of Rheingold whenever you fry beer...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARNIE>
<DIRECTION>
He arrives, looks down... and stops singing. His eyes widen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE CINDERS BY THE TRACK, ARNIE'S POV NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We can see the hole where ARNIE put his beer, but it is of course empty. Beside it are two huge prints in the cinders, half wolf, half human.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ARNIE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's beginning to be afraid. Beginning to look around to see what might be out here with him. Beginning to realize he is in extremely deep shit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOUND: A SHATTERING, SNARLING ROAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE WEREWOLF NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It rises up on its hind legs, eyes glaring an ugly yellow green. Its snout wrinkles back, revealing those teeth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ARNIE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's craning back to look at the thing, his face a grue of horror.
</DIRECTION>
<ARNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh n-
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARNIE>
<DIRECTION>
A huge clawed hand/paw comes sweeping down. ARNIE's head is granted an immediate Reno-style divorce from the rest of his body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE RAIL-RIDER NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOUND of the beast approaching. A hairy arm and taloned hand reaches into the toolbox bolted to the back and rummages. The hand is dripping blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It comes up with a bottle of Rheingold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The WEREWOLF begins to sing. It is a bizarre funny-horrible grunting, the words hellishly recognizable.
</DIRECTION>
<WEREWOLF>
<DIRECTION>
(gutteral; subhuman)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My beer is Rheingold the dry beer...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEREWOLF>
<DIRECTION>
No bottle opener for this thing; it brings the neck of the bottle down sharply on the edge of the toolbox. Beer foams out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE WEREWOLF'S FACE, IN DEEP SHADOW NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He/It rams the jagged neck of the bottle deep into its mouth and drinks. Foam drizzles down its pelt. It's grinning.
</DIRECTION>
<WEREWOLF>
<DIRECTION>
(snarling voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Think of Rheingold whenever you buy beer...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEREWOLF>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE WEREWOLF, CU NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bottle is empty. There are CRUNCHING SOUNDS as it begins to eat the bottle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blood begins to run out of its mouth; its face wrinkles in pain and fury. It spits out broken, bloody jags of glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looks up. It HOWLS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TARKER'S MILLS NIGHT - MOONLIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We're looking at Main Street of a small country town - might be New England, might be mid-South. Might be 1984, might be 1981. This is Tarker's Mills, and in places like this, time moves more slowly. Cars - not too many - move back and forth. No one is in a hurry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see the Methodist church (and the parsonage next door); Andy's Sporting Goods; Owen's Pub, with its Narragansett neon sign. We see a barber shop with a striped pole; we see the Holy Family Catholic Church and the rectory next door. We see the Gem Theater, which is showing a revival of Sophia Loren in "Two Women." It's Our Town, U.S.A.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(voice-over)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This place is Tarker's Mills, where I grew up... and this is how it was when I was fourteen - a place where people cared about each other as much as they cared about themselves. This is how my town looked as, all unknowing, it approached the rim of the nightmare. The killing had begun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
SOUND: The HOWL of the WEREWOLF - distant, a bit dreamy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT./INT. TARKER'S MILLS MONTAGE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
a.) VIRGIL CUTTS, owner of Virgil's Texaco, is filling up a car. We hear the HOWl... and VIRGIL looks up uneasily. b.) In the barber shop, BILLY McCLAREN, the barber, is just taking the apron off the Methodist minister, REV. O'BANION. They both look around. c.) Folks are coming out of the Gem Theater. They pause at the sound of that HOWL and look toward the edge of town.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE SETTING MOON, CU NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As JANE speaks, we see the moon sink below the horizon.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(v-o)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The killing had begun, but at first no one knew it. Arnie Westrum was a chronic drunk, and what happened seemed like an accident.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE RAIL-RIDER AND ARNIE'S HEADLESS BODY NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly the view improves, grows lighter, as we TIME-LAPSE TO DAWN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOUND: A train is approaching. We hear its horn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA MOVES IN. Here is a shattered Rheingold bottle. There is a litter of ARNIE'S tools. And here, on the cheek of ARNIE'S severed head, a few ants are checking things out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOUND: The train's horn, MUCH CLOSER.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(v-o)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The county coroner concluded that Arnie passed out on the tracks. There wasn't enough evidence to conclude anything else.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
And suddenly the train comes smashing into the frame, horn blaring. The rail-rider goes flying. ARNIE'S body disappears underneath. We see something flopping and moving under there. It could be a bundle of rags. Could be... but isn't.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TARKER'S MILLS TOWN COMMON DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The common is more or less in the center of town, either surrounded by Main Street commerce or backed by it. THE CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY IN on a big tent that's been erected on the Common - looks like a revival meeting tent, almost, but the banner draped over the entrance reads: SUPPORT THE TARKER'S MILLS MEDCU DRIVE!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind or to the side, on the grass, picnic tables have been set out end-to-end. Women are putting salads and home-baked breads on these - just about the whole town is going to sit down to a meal when the meeting's over. Further off, men are tending barbecues, roasting corn, etc.
</DIRECTION>

	I'd like to give you Father Lester Lowe, of Holy Family Catholic Church!

<DIRECTION>
Enthusiastic applause greets this.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE CROWD DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Most of the town is here, seated on folding chairs. We're looking particularly at three people - NAN COSLAW, her husband BOB, and their fourteen-year-old daughter, JANE. It is JANE - a slightly older JANE - who we have heard speaking. She is now a bit bored with the meeting, which has been going on for some time. As the APPLAUSE CONTINUES, she leans toward her mother.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going out for a while, 'kay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<NAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right. Stay close. And make sure your brother's all right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NAN>
<DIRECTION>
As JANE gets up, the applause starts to fade a bit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NOTE: JANE is wearing a silver crucifix, and will continue to wear it through the whole movie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE PODIUM DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
To one side is a big black-and-white photograph on an easel. It shows a van which has been customized into an emergency medical unit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind the podium are four chairs. REV. TOM O'BANION sits in one of them. ANDY FAIRTON sits in another, red-faced and beaming. JOE HALLER, the town constable, is just returning to his; LESTER LOWE is just approaching the mike as the applause dies. LOWE'S face shines with love and goodwill.

She is making her way down the row to the aisle (the people should be seated in folding chairs). She passes a GIRL of about her own age who has overheard NAN'S parting shot.

Good-natured laughter greets this.

INT. LOWE AT THE PODIUM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bit flustered, he taps the mike and is rewarded by a BRIEF SCREAM OF FEEDBACK.
</DIRECTION>
<LOWE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For the last ten years, I have had a dream. A dream of a time when modern medical care would come to this small community, which sometimes seems so far from Durham, with her lifesaving hospitals. I hope that this meeting, at which I see so many of my friends gathered, will be the start of making my dream come true.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOWE>
<DIRECTION>
SOUND: Enthusiastic applause.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. A SNAKE IN THE GRASS, CU
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a blacksnake... harmless, but big. It goes wriggling through the grass toward a stream. In the b.g. - SOUND OF APPLAUSE.

Hands - the rather grimy hands of a boy bent on mischief - grab the blacksnake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MARTY AND BRADY, CU
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BRADY holds the snake up. Both boys gaze at it with respectful wonder.

<MARTY>
	<DIALOGUE>

BRADY hands it over. As MARTY looks at the snake, BRADY sees:

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was almost fifteen that summer. My brother Marty was eleven. Marty and his friend Brady Kincaid were the crosses I had to bear. Brady was actually the worse of the two, but I was rarely disposed to see that. Not when my younger brother was so constantly thrown in my face by my parents.

EXT. MARTY AND BRADY
</DIRECTION>

Again we are fairly tight on the boys - we see them from waist or chest height. BRADY snatches back the snake.

	I got an idea.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRADY>
<MARTY>
	<DIALOGUE>

BRADY looks toward JANE. MARTY follows his gaze. His eyes widen.

	<DIALOGUE>
	You wouldn't.

BRADY grins. MARTY assesses the grin.

She is walking slowly toward the picnic area, and is passing under a tree. There's more applause from the tent.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Jane... Jane...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRADY>
<DIRECTION>
She looks up. The blacksnake dangles down toward her, almost touching her upturned face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JANE shrieks and bolts. She gets a little way, trips over her own feet and falls down hard. She's wearing what was a nice jumper and nylons. Now the jumper is torn and the hose shredded at the knees.

EXT. THE TREE, WITH BRADY

He's lying over a limb with the snake in his hand, laughing wildly.

She gets up, looks at her clothes, her bloody knees. She's near tears.

The shot's from the chest up. He looks sorry he was a part of this little stunt, as he ought to be.

He moves toward JANE - there is something queerly unnatural in this movement, and in a moment we'll understand, but for the time being we must be puzzled.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jane, I'm sorry. It was just a joke. We didn't mean-

</MARTY>
<DIRECTION>
He's reached her. JANE is sobbing now, hysterical.

She runs away.

STELLA RANDOLPH, a plump but sweetly pretty girl, comes to the stairs but does not descend them. She is also crying - but these are real tears, folks. STELLA is a human Niagara Falls.

EXT. JANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We can hear STELLA sobbing as JANE walks slowly toward the bandstand with her panty hose still balled up in one hand. JANE looks suddenly aware that she's not the only one in this sad world who has troubles. She reaches the foot of the stairs going up to the bandstand and tosses the hose absently in a litter can.

JANE mounts the steps timidly.

STELLA has retreated to one of the benches, where she is bawling into a handful of Kleenex. Pudgy and twenty-two, she is both funny and terribly sad. She looks around at the sound of JANE's voice.

INT. THE STATION WAGON DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOB and NAN COSLAW are sitting up front. MARTY and JANE are in the backseat. JANE is as far from MARTY as she can get. She's still mad as hell. Band-Aids crisscross her knees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARTY'S wheelchair is collapsed in the cargo area of the wagon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NAN turns around to look at the kids - and it's really JANE she's mad at.
</DIRECTION>
<NAN>

	I want you two to bury the hatchet. You're being very silly, Jane.

	Jane, I-

<NAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you're being mean as well as silly. Your brother has never had a scraped knee in his whole life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NAN>
<DIRECTION>
Well, here it is - the chief source of JANE'S animus against her brother and the source of most of the tension in the COSLAW family.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARTY winces and turns away a little, embarrassed - this always happens. He doesn't like it, but he doesn't know how to make his parents - his mother in particular - quit it.

<JANE>

	You always take his side because he's a cripple! Well, it's not my fault that he's a cripple!

INT. THE DOOR TO JANE'S BEDROOM, WITH MARTY NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is in his "house wheelchair" - not the Silver Bullet (he was in the Bullet during the Common scene, but we didn't get a very good look at it). He has some stuff on his lap. A box, for sure.

<DIRECTION>
Her eyes are open but she says nothing. Just looks at the wall.

<DIRECTION>
INT. MARTY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He rolls across to her bed and puts something on her night table. SOUND of change and a rattle of paper. She rolls over and sees he's put about three bucks on the table. Plus a can of mixed nuts.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the money for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<MARTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?

<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want your money. You're a booger.

<MARTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was Brady's idea, Jane. Honest to God. Please take the money. I want to make up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTY>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him and sees he's sincere - honestly contrite. She softens. There's hope for these two kids yet, maybe.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can get a pair of L'Eggs down at the pharmacy for a dollar forty-nine. Here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
She pushes the rest back to him, then looks at the can. She picks it up, curious.

<MARTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's for you, too. Uncle Al gave it to me-

</JANE>
<MARTY>

	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTY>
<DIRECTION>
He gives her a warm, melting smile. When your little brother is being good to you it's time to watch out - but JANE has been lulled. She starts to open it, then looks questioningly at him.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, go ahead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTY>
<DIRECTION>
She opens it. A long paper snake - the kind with a spring inside it - leaps out. She shrieks.

MARTY backs up the wheelchair so he's out of her reach.

She tries to be angry with him... and cannot (this is a response, we'll find, that both MARTY and his UNCLE AL evoke). She smiles at him a little.

He reverses his wheelchair, also smiling a little, and leaves.

EXT. TARKER'S MILLS, UNDER THE MOON NIGHT

We're looking down at a brave little nestle of lights.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOUND: A HOWL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. A HOUSE SOME DISTANCE OUT IN THE COUNTRY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's one light on upstairs and another downstairs... also downstairs is the bluish flicker of TV light.
</DIRECTION>

An ivy trellis climbs one side of the house.

SOUNDS: Canned laughter; TV dialogue.

INT. THE LIVING ROOM OF THE RANDOLPH HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STELLA'S MOTHER, asleep in front of the TV.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. A PRETTY CHINA DISH, CU
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A whole bunch of capsules are dumped into it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAMERA DRAWS BACK to show us STELLA, sitting by her vanity mirror. The rest of the room is reflected in the mirror, including the window - we are upstairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
[NOTE: It would be nice to see that fat moon floating in the window!]
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a framed picture of STELLA's ex-boyfriend on the vanity beside the dish of pills. STELLA sets down the empty prescription bottle the pills came from beside this picture. We can clearly read the word "Nembutol" on it. There is also a large glass of water on the vanity table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STELLA turns the picture facedown. She might be crying but probably she's not. She takes about five of the pills, starts to lift them to her mouth-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HOWL outside... closer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STELLA looks around for a moment, then takes the pills with some water. She pauses, looking at herself.
</DIRECTION>
<STELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Suicides go to hell. Especially if they're pregnant. And I don't even care.

She takes another five pills. And another five.

SOUNDS: Rattling foliage.

Claw-hands are seizing it and climbing. SOUNDS of hoarse, guttural breathing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STELLA AT THE VANITY TABLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She takes another handful of pills... and the window behind her shatters inward. There is a bellowing roar as the werewolf throws itself through.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE LIVING ROOM, WITH MOTHER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She sits up, startled awake.

<DIRECTION>
From upstairs: ANOTHER SHATTERING ROAR... FOLLOWED BY A SCREAM.

	Oh my dear God... Stella!

She runs for the doorway and the hall. From upstairs comes a confusion of SOUNDS: roars, breaking furniture, shattering glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STELLA'S BED, CU
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of those deadly claw-hands sweeps down the bed, ripping through the sheets... the mattress... the spring itself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hairy, muddy feet with protruding talons leap onto it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STELLA'S WINDOW, EXTREME UP-ANGLE

The werewolf leaps out - it's graceful, savage, animal.

She reaches the closed door of STELLA's room, vacillates there for a moment... and then pushes it open and goes in.

A long beat of silence as we hold on the door.

MOTHER SHRIEKS.

INT. MOTHER'S FACE, ECU

She shrieks again.

<DIRECTION>
INT. STELLA'S ROOM, WIDE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a total shambles; blood is splattered everywhere; the mirror is broken, the picture of DAN the gay deceiver is broken; the bed is torn in two. There are big, muddy wolfprints on the remnants of the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STELLA lies propped in the corner with Nembutols all around her. Suicide may have been what she planned, but it sure isn't what happened.
</DIRECTION>

MOTHER SHRIEKS.

EXT. TARKER'S MILLS MONTAGE MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
a.) MR. PELTZER puts out his paper rack - just the "Press-Herald" this morning. He looks shocked and grim. The scare headline: BRUTAL MURDER ROCKS WESTERN MAINE. We can see STELLA'S photograph. b.) Through the window of Robertson's Luncheonette, we see the proprietor, BOBBY ROBERTSON, talking earnestly with a bunch of men. Among them: MILT STURMFULLER, ALFIE KNOPFLER, VIRGIL CUTTS, BILLY McCLAREN, and ELMER ZINNEMAN, a farmer we'll meet later. c.) At Andy's Sporting Goods, ANDY FAIRTON is putting a big hand-lettered sign in the window. It reads: REMINGTON SHOTGUNS SINGLE ACTION DOUBLE ACTION PUMP PROTECT YOURSELF AND YOUR FAMILY! d.) At the Methodist parsonage, a '53 Dodge pulls slowly out and MOTHER RANDOLPH gets out, weeping. As she approaches the parsonage door, LESTER LOWE comes out and embraces her.

HALLER slams the phone down with an angry bang. He looks like a guy who has been up all night. PETE, his pudgy deputy, looks like a high school athlete who has suddenly found himself batting in the World Series.
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What'd they say, Joe?

He gets slowly up.

It's a comfortable red-brick building on a side street. Ivy climbs up the sides. Two or three rows of bikes stand along one side of the building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOUND: The bell rings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beat or two, then the doors bang wide and a billion kids spill out. It's the end of the first day of school, and they are excited. They range from Grade 1 to Grade 8. Most kids book it for home as fast as they can, getting on their bikes and riding or just running.

Everyone has a pink report card.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. A BUNCH OF KIDS, WITH BRADY KINCAID AND TAMMY STURMFULLER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BRADY and TAMMY are riding bikes. Now there is the SOUND of a gasoline engine, and MARTY catches up. He's got the Silver Bullet's motor running for the first time in the movie. Later on it will sound extremely powerful, like a racing car, but now it just sounds like a big lawnmower engine with a muffler on it. It's pretty cool, though - a bright metallic silver with flame decals on the motor housing. Looks sort of like something Big Daddy Roth might have thought up. On the back is a license plate which says SILVER BULLET.

TAMMY and MARTY watch as BRADY zooms off toward home on his bike. MARTY pushes in a hand clutch and moves a small lever. He bumps down over the curb and they cross the street side by side, TAMMY on her bike, MARTY in his wheelchair.

He pops up over the curbing with a bounce. He shoves in the little hand clutch and revs the engine. Va-room!

The driveway is blocked off with a sawhorse bearing the stenciled words POLICE INVESTIGATION. The yard is filled with cop cars - HALLER'S constable car, plus a number of state police vehicles. Uniformed men come and go.

It stands a bit behind the house itself. A creepy place. Many of the glass panes are broken; some of these - not many - have been blocked with cardboard. The inside is a jungle of plants that have run to riot. In the f.g. is a mucky-looking garden patch where nothing much is growing.

MARTY pulls in. The wheelchair motor starts to pop and lug and misfire. The chair makes it to the first pump on the island closest to the street and then stalls as VIRGIL CUTTS comes over.

INT. THE DEN, WITH UNCLE AL AND MARTY NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNCLE AL is the family's sheep of a darker color. He's thirty, good-looking, raffish. He's also drunk. He's got both whiskey and beer. An ashtray beside him overflows with butts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He and MARTY are playing draw poker for MARTY'S baseball cards. Each has a pile in front of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARTY really loves UNCLE AL... his eyes just glow when he looks at him.

<MARTY>

	Okay, okay. I call.

NAN comes briskly over. She's seen and heard enough. She favors UNCLE AL with a glare and then looks protectively at MARTY.

INT. THE STAIRWELL OF THE COSLAW HOME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARTY is sitting in a stair chair that rises slowly to the second floor. He looks dejected and glum.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOUND of NAN hectoring her brother AL. I don't think we can make out all of what's going on, but we've all known women like NAN and I think we can fill in the blanks. "Christian household... you come here drunk and expect... can't even bother to call ahead..." Etc., etc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A wheelchair stands on the second-floor landing. This one is no Silver Bullet, only the more humble sort that moves by arm power. When the stair chair clicks to a stop, MARTY hoists himself from it into the wheelchair and rolls down the hall toward the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Below, NAN'S rant is still going on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE DEN, WITH NAN AND UNCLE AL NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNCLE AL is clearing up in a kind of drunken stupor- and I mean he is really drunk. He's smoking one cigarette; another is smoldering away in the heaping ashtray. He drops a pile of baseball cards on the floor and bonks his head on the table bending down to pick them up.
</DIRECTION>
<NAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want you drinking around Marty. That's too much. If you can't stop it, you better stay away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NAN>
<DIRECTION>
AL straightens up. There is a sort of command force in this man, and here he is partly able to rise above his abysmal drunkenness so we can see it.
</DIRECTION>
<UNCLE_AL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I come here because Marty needs a friend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</UNCLE_AL>
<NAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes... you've always been that to him. But if you can't leave your booze in whatever dump you call home, you better just stay away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NAN>
<DIRECTION>
She leaves the room, almost crying. UNCLE AL looks after her, and then his attention is drawn to the smoldering ashtray. He pours beer over the mess, putting out the fire but creating something that looks even worse. He begins drunkenly picking up again.

He lunges at her, but JANE steps back easily. MARTY overbalances and falls out of the wheelchair. His toothbrush clatters across the tile.

INT. MARTY AND JANE, A MUCH CLOSER SHOT

One of MARTY'S cheeks is pressed against the floor. His eyes are shut. He's weeping.

SOUND of her climbing the stairs.

JANE throws a quick look back over her shoulder and then helps MARTY up in his chair. He helps by pulling on the sink counter. JANE has time to give MARTY one quick look- "Please don't tell on me," it says.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NAN comes in.
</DIRECTION>
<NAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jane, have you been teasing your brother again?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NAN>
<MARTY>

	She wasn't, Mom- I dropped my toothbrush and fell over when I tried to get it. Jane helped pick me up.

INT. TAMMY'S BEDROOM NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's deeply asleep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE LIVING ROOM NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"Big-time Wrestling" on the TV. SOUND of a refrigerator door closing. MILT STURMFULLER comes into the living room from the kitchen. He's wearing his long johns with the designer pee stains and has a quart bottle of Rheingold the dry beer in each hand. He sits down, looking at the TV.

More noises. There is a beat of silence, and then something- one of those earthen plant pots, I think- falls over and SHATTERS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE LIVING ROOM, WITH MILT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up briefly- he's heard something- but the crowd on the TV is loud and the match is reaching its climax.

A LOW SNARL. Plants shake and shiver. Another crash, LOUDER.

INT. MILT, IN THE LIVING ROOM

<DIRECTION>
Looks toward the window. He gets up, goes over, and looks out.

EXT. THE GREENHOUSE, MEDIUM-LONG (MILT'S POV)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOUND of another crash. Plants move.

INT. THE HALL, WITH MILT

He takes a shotgun from the wall, breaks it, and looks inside.

</MILT>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE STURMFULLER GREENHOUSE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door at the end SCREECHES OPEN and MILT, still holding the shotgun at port arms, comes cautiously in. This place is really overgrown.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MILT advances slowly into the jungle of plants, and the director will shoot it as he likes to build the suspense. I'm sure that plants brush his face, and a bug or two- maybe even a big plump spider- will land on him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He hears a SCUTTERING SOUND and whirls.

INT. GREENHOUSE FLOOR, MILT'S POV NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A mouse goes running across the warped boards (which have pulled apart from each other, showing deep cracks between).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MILT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He relaxes and starts forward again. We keep expecting it to happen, but it keeps not happening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, as MILT is starting back toward the door, two big, hairy arms come up through the floor- bursting through two of those cracks and shoving the splintered boards upward- and grab MILT'S legs at the knees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOUNDS: BESTIAL ROARS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MILT screams and triggers off the shotgun- unfortunately, it is pointing straight up. Glass showers down on him. He is pulled down into the shattered hole- now we can see him only from the knees up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TAMMY STURMFULLER'S BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She sits up in bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOUNDS of ROARS and MILT SCREAMING from the greenhouse.

MRS. STURMFULLER, in a nightgown with her hair done up in rollers, comes into Tammy's room.

INT. THE GREENHOUSE, WITH MILT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's now waist deep in the hole in the floor, surrounded by broken, splintered boards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOUNDS: RIPPING FLESH, CRUNCHING BONES. MILT SHRIEKS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is abruptly jerked downward again. He is being eaten from the feet up. As he's jerked down, one of the leaning, splintered boards rams into his chest. MILT collapses over it like an old Roman collapsing on his sword.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hairy arm reaches up and grabs his neck. MILT is jerked all the way into the hole, board and all.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE GREENHOUSE, FROM TAMMY'S BEDROOM WINDOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOUNDS of SNARLS, GROWLS, GRUNTS.

INT. TAMMY AND MRS. STURMFULLER

<DIRECTION>
They are hugging each other, terrified, by the window.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. THE STURMFULLER PLACE, MEDIUM-LONG DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The police cars are now here. There's also a meat wagon. As we watch, a number of cops- JOE HALLER and PETE SYLVESTER are among them- approach the wagon. Many are carrying canvas bags.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. THE STURMFULLER YARD, FEATURING PETE SYLVESTER

He drops the blood stained bag he's carrying, runs to the bushes, and noisily blows his groceries.

EXT. TARKER'S MILLS MONTAGE #3 DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
a.) On Oak Street, MRS. THAYER is hurrying toward home, obviously spooked. She keeps looking behind herself and nearly flies up the steps to her house. Then there is the endless business of fumbling with her keys. Finally she lurches inside and slams the door. b.) On Main Street, at the Holy Family rectory, FATHER O'BANION is closing the shutters...and locking them. c.) On a residential street, a kid is playing with some plastic trucks outside of a picket fence. Except for him, the street is deserted. His mother comes out and hauls him in. d.) ANDY FAIRTON, in the sporting-goods store, checks an automatic pistol and then holsters it on his hip. He has a pugnacious, unpleasant look. e.) BILLY McCLAREN turns the sign on the door of his barber shop from OPEN to CLOSED, looks out warily at the street (to make sure there are no psycho killers out there for trims, I guess), then leaves and locks the door behind him. THE CAMERA FOLLOWS him down a couple of store fronts to Owen's, where he also goes in. f.) The paper rack in front of Peltzer's Drug/ The "Press-Herald" headline is a sixteen-pointer: MANIAC CLAIMS SECOND VICTIM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MARTY AND BRADY KINCAID MAGIC HOUR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They're flying kites on the common. Some distance in the b.g. is the bandstand. MARTY is of course flying his kite as he sits in the Silver Bullet. The boys are having a blast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES AWAY from the boys, centers on Owen's Pub across the street, and ZOOMS IN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the window is a poster. It reads: $10,000 REWARD FOR INFORMATION LEADING TO THE CAPTURE OF THE MAN (OR ANIMAL) WHO KILLED STELLA RANDOLPH AND MILTON STURMFULLER. And, at the bottom: TARKER'S MILLS CITIZENS' COMMITTEE.

At a f.g. table: VIRGIL CUTTS, BOBBY ROBERTSON, ELMER ZINNEMAN, and his brother PORTER ZINNEMAN. Behind them, at the bar, we see PETE SYLVESTER having a beer with BILLY McCLAREN. As we look around the bar, we will also see FATHER LESTER LOWE, sitting at an unobtrusive corner table, nursing a beer and listening closely to the conversation.

SOUND of panting.

MARTY comes into the frame, pulling himself up by the arms. His arms are very strong, although his legs trail limply behind him (like the tail of a kite). He sits on a branch, untangles the kite and the string, and looks down.

He reaches under the bar and comes out with a baseball bat. Burned into the side of the bat, so it reads vertically toward the handle, is the word "peacemaker." OWEN hurries around the bar with it.

PETE is standing in front of ANDY, fists balled up, fat face trembling with determination.

	You heard what I said, motormouth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<DIRECTION>
ANDY gets up, infuriated. There's apparently going to be a brawl. Behind them, HERB KINCAID has approached the table. HERB hasn't even noticed what's going on; he's got problems of his own.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HERB KINCAID
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He clears his throat. This is a mild, timid man- he doesn't like to speak in public, particularly not in a bar, but the imperatives of the situation demand it right now.

INT. THE PUB, A NEW ANGLE
</DIRECTION>

Everyone looks at HERB. Conversation stops. ANDY and PETE freeze with their fists balled up, like little kids playing statues tag. OWEN is caught a little distance from ANDY and PETE, with the "peacemaker" still in his hands.

EXT. THE TOWN COMMON, LONG

Now it is almost completely dark, and a large reddish summer moon is rising over the horizon.

SOUND: A LONG, WAVERING WOLF HOWL... LOUD.

INT. OWEN'S PUB

All conversation has stopped. All have turned toward the door and the windows; all hear the HOWL. Deep fright overlies each face.

JOE HALLER comes out of the constable's office in a hurry, letting the door bang the wall. He's buckling on his gun belt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE BANDSTAND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BRADY'S kite, torn in a couple of places, flutters on the steps leading up to the bandstand. The yellow smile face grins eerily in the darkness. It is streaked with blood.

</JOE_HALLER>
<DIRECTION>
He comes out of the shadows, his drawn gun dangling by his side. This man has had an extremely bad shock. The legs of his uniform pants are splashed with blood. He makes it down two steps and then sits heavily by the remains of BRADY'S smiling, bloody kite. He looks straight ahead. He looks at nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLER>

He looks at the kite, then looks away. He puts a hand over his face and starts to cry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE COMMON, LOOKING BACK TOWARD MAIN STREET NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A number of men - not all that were in Owen's but quite a few of them - are running toward the bandstand. HERB KINCAID is in the lead, screaming his son's name over and over.

</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
SOUND: HERB SCREAMS. A pause. HERB screams again. The men flinch back. HALLER doesn't look up. Now, from the darkness on the bandstand, HERB begins to LAUGH. The men shrink back further, looking more uneasy than ever.

EXT. THE BANDSTAND, MEN'S POV NIGHT

HERB KINCAID appears. He is laughing. He is smeared with his son's blood. In each hand he holds one of his son's shoes.

	We'll bury his shoes because his feet are still in them and they're the only part of him that makes sense anymore.

There are lots of cars parked in front of the church, but there's a space left just big enough for UNCLE AL'S MG. MARTY'S Silver Bullet is strapped to the back.

MARTY'S chair is at the back of the church. Most of the mourners are crying. MRS. BOWIE is playing the organ. BRADY'S coffin is on a bier at the front - closed of course. There are lots of flowers.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As we look at them, from left to right: UNCLE AL, MARTY, TAMMY, MRS. STURMFULLER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNCLE AL unobtrusively takes a small silver flask from his hip pocket. Engraved on it in Old English letters is the word "rotgut." He spins the cap and takes a quick knock. He pauses and glances at MARTY, who looks deeply stunned.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(v-o continues)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...they didn't at all mind drafting him. As to the sort of comfort Uncle Al may have been able to offer him...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
UNCLE AL hands the flask to MARTY. MARTY looks at him questioningly for a moment, and then drinks. MARTY looks at TAMMY, who looks frankly terrible. Her mother is looking away. MARTY nudges her. She looks around at him. He offers her the flask. Her eyes widen.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(v-o continues)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I now believe that was best kept between the two of them...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
After a brief moment's consideration, TAMMY takes the flask and has a deep swallow. She hands the flask back to MARTY, who hands it quickly back to UNCLE AL as TAMMY coughs. Her mother looks at her... then at MARTY and UNCLE AL. UNCLE AL smiles sympathetically, hiding the flask with one hand, as if to say, "Isn't it a terrible thing?" MRS. STURMFULLER looks distractedly back toward the service.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(v-o concludes)

	If there is any word of comfort I can give you, it's just this: the face of the beast always becomes known; the time of the beast always passes.

</LOWE>
<DIRECTION>
He is struggling with this, trying dreadfully hard.
</DIRECTION>
<LOWE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If there are times when we feel alone and afraid, only small creatures in the dark, then these are the times when we must turn to one another for our comfort and our hope. To our neighbors. To our community. To our love for each other. I alone cannot ease the pain for Herb and Naomi Kincaid, nor can I ease your pain, nor you ease mine. But if I believe anything it's this: we can comfort each other. We can heal each other. We can go on together.

	The Bible tells us not to fear the terror that creepeth by night or that which flieth by noonday, and yet we do... we do. Because there is much we don't know, and we feel very small. But we must not be alone. We must not allow ourselves to be alone, for there is the wide gate to the hell of terror. Turn to each other. Join hands in your sorrow and try to remember that the face of the beast always becomes known.

</DIRECTION>

ANDY FAIRTON is standing on the bar. These are his vigilantes; he has organized them. ANDY radiates male macho football-coach confidence. He's mesmerized the crowd: they really believe they are going to go out and Shoot One for the Gipper.

The door at the back opens; HALLER and PETE come in. JOE HALLER is in extremely bad shape. He hasn't come back much from the murder of BRADY. I believe he is having some sort of spiritual crisis, and while it is not our purpose to explore what it might be- this is, after all, a horror movie and not a John Cassavetes film- we can see that it has seriously weakened his authority.

HALLER looks at him for a moment, then turns to look at the crowd. They look rather like a lynch mob; on their faces we see an uneasy mix of shame and eager determination. HALLER speaks with a kind of haggard, fading desperation.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The law has a name for what you men are planning. It's private justice, and private justice is about a step and a half away from lynch mobs and hang ropes. I'm no J. Edgar Hoover, but I am the law in Tarker's Mills, and I want you men to go home.

More cars and trucks pull away. There's a big old Ford "woody" wagon still there, with ANDY FAIRTON standing impatiently by the driver's side door. BILLY McCLAREN and BOBBY ROBERTSON are with him, and a big, solid-looking woman named MAGGIE ANDREWS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OWEN comes out and crosses to the woody.

They pile into the car, ANDY behind the wheel. He throws it into gear and backs out onto Main Street.

EXT. MAIN STREET, A NEW ANGLE

<DIRECTION>
We see a parade of cars and pickup trucks headed out of town.
</DIRECTION>

He's standing on the curb and watching them leave town in procession, some honking their horns, others yelling cheerfully. The expression on his face is dark and brooding.

EXT. ELMER AND PORTER ZINNEMAN NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELMER is lying on his belly, stuck halfway under a barbed-wire fence. The seat of his pants is badly snagged. The brothers are on the verge of a wooded area. We can see ground mist creeping around the bottoms of the trees.
</DIRECTION>
<ELMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help me Porter, goddammit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELMER>
<DIRECTION>
PORTER grabs ELMER'S right arm and pulls. There's a RIPPING SOUND. ELMER screams.
</DIRECTION>
<ELMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't pull me! You want to rip the right cheek of my ass right off?

EXT. IN THE WOODS, WITH REV. O'BANION AND VIRGIL CUTTS NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
O'BANION looks rather amusing in his hunting gear- like that priest from "The Exorcist" on safari.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOUND: A HOWL, FAIRLY LOUD
</DIRECTION>
<VIRGIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, that was close. Uh, pardon me, Rev'runt.

<O_BANION>

	Come on. Be careful.

</O_BANION>
<DIRECTION>
They move slowly ahead, O'BANION still a bit in the lead. THE CAMERA FOLLOWS as the reverend pushes into some knee-high brush.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOUND: A RUSTY METALLIC CLANG, followed by a FLESHY CHOMP.
</DIRECTION>

O'BANION begins to scream and struggle.

EXT. O'BANION'S FOOT, VIRGIL'S POV

A medium-sized trap- something in which one might reasonably catch a wild cat or a coydog, let us say- has its rusty teeth sunk deeply into the reverend's ankle.

Relaxing.

SOUND: THE WOLF HOWLING CLOSE.

Startled and unnerved by the HOWL, the trap slips out of his hands and snaps shut on O'BANION'S mangled ankle again.

<DIRECTION>
ANDY, BILLY McCLAREN, BOBBY ROBERTSON, OWEN KNOPFLER, and MAGGIE ANDREWS have been joined by two other men- MR. ASPINALL and EDGAR ROUNDS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They have drawn close together, listening as the HOWL FADES. We can tell by their uneasy faces that some of the joy has gone out of the evening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are standing on one side of a ravine. The bottom is filled with a still ground mist. A few bushes poke out of it. There are woods on the far side.

They come slowly down toward THE CAMERA, alert and ready for anything- at least, they think so.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ANDY'S GROUP, ANGLE SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They reach the bottom of the ravine and begin to make their way across it. The mist is waist to chest deep. They push toward the other side. Now they are about halfway.

<DIRECTION>
SOUND: A STEADY, LOW GROWLING, CLOSE.
</DIRECTION>

They all stop, scared.

The GROWLING STOPS. There's a beat of silence. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOUND: SNARLING...AND A RIPPING CHOMP as dinner is served.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOUND: A SCREAM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. EDGAR ROUNDS, CLOSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's the one screaming, and if he reminds us of O'BANION, that's okay, because ROUNDS has also been caught in a trap. He tries to run, stumbles, falls into the ground fog. He goes on screaming. We can see his back for a moment, and then it disappears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOUNDS OF CRUNCHING AND SCREAMING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROUNDS SHRIEKS. His hand and arm come up like the hand of a drowning man. Then it's gone. ROUNDS is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE SKIRMISH LINE

They stand there, chest deep in mist, a conspicuous hole in the ranks where EDGAR was.

ASPINALL SHRIEKS and tries to run. He falls into the mist. There is another CHOMP. When he flounders up, half his face is gone.

The WEREWOLF dives under the ground mist.

Uncertain, OWEN begins to back up, holding the bat in his hands. OWEN is jerked down into the mist. He SCREAMS. The peacemaker rises out of the ground mist and comes down. Bonk! The WEREWOLF roars in pain. CHOMPING SOUND. OWEN shrieks.

The peacemaker rises out of the mist again. The hands holding it are bloody. Blood runs down the bat. It descends. Bonk! The WEREWOLF roars again. There is a GURGLING SCREAM from OWEN... and then a curious SPLINTERING SOUND as the WEREWOLF sinks its fangs into the bat.

THE CAMERA MOVES ABOVE as the WEREWOLF moves below, escaping down the draw.

It's an almost exact reprise of #167. Most of the mourners are crying; MRS. BOWIE playing the organ; MARTY'S chair parked at the back. We can see UNCLE AL, MARTY, TAMMY, and MRS. STURMFULLER, exactly as they were at BRADY KINCAID'S funeral; in fact, this seems to be an instant reply of that event. One difference: we can't see BRADY'S coffin. It's below us. The hymn ends.

They are all changing. Among the things we see are:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PETE SYLVESTER, who is a church deacon, rushing down the aisle, changing, snarling. He grabs ANDY FAIRTON and the two of them grapple in the aisle.
</DIRECTION>

A YOUNG WOMAN with a baby in her arms turns back the blanket covering the baby's face and we see it's a wolfling; already the YOUNG WOMAN'S own hands are turning into claws.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TAMMY STURMFULLER changing; PELTZER the druggist changing; the ZINNEMAN BROTHERS changing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the organ, MRS. BOWIE is now a werewolf clad in tatters of a silk bombazine dress; she/it is still wearing a veiled hat on her head, and she is beating the shit out of the organ keys with her clawed hands. She sounds like Jerry Lee Lewis after swallowing about a dozen bennies. And now the tune changes from the remnants of "Bringing In The Sheaves." It changes into the Rheingold jingle.

UNCLE AL'S sports car is parked in the driveway. We hear the CLANG of a wrench on the cement inside.

<DIRECTION>
INT. THE GARAGE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNCLE AL and MARTY are working on the engine of the Silver Bullet. UNCLE AL has a six-pack of beer that he's working through. He and MARTY sit on the floor. As they talk, UNCLE AL unscrews the last bolt holding the Bullet's carburetor and pulls it off.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTY>

	It isn't enough that the monster killed all those people- that he killed Brady. Now he's got them to cancel the fair.

MARTY does. UNCLE AL slides the carb onto the gasket and starts attaching bolts.

<UNCLE_AL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All is cool, Marty-boy. Go for it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</UNCLE_AL>
<DIRECTION>
MARTY pushes the starter. The engine starts at once, but the tone is entirely different. Before, MARTY'S wheelchair was a poppety-popping pussycat. Now the engine rumbles like a hood's street rod idling at a traffic light.

MARTY looks startled.

EXT. MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA TRACKS HIM up the road. He goes slowly at first, but he lets it out a little after a while. He's really moving along- thirty, maybe forty miles an hour. The wind blows the hair off his forehead. He begins to grin. He's enjoying this.

He winds the engine up and pops the clutch. The Silver Bullet doesn't so much accelerate as blast off. It tilts back on its wheels. MARTY swivels into a position like that of an astronaut on lift-off. The Silver Bullet looks like a motorcycle popping a wheelie. MARTY has a great big grin on his face.

EXT. THE SILVER BULLET, MEDIUM-LONG

Roaring down the highway at fifty or better, blue smoke jetting from the exhaust. MARTY is plastered back in the seat with the footrest pointing up at an angle. He's laughing like a lunatic.

AL unlocks the trunk of his car and brings out a paper shopping bag. He places the bag in MARTY'S lap. MARTY opens the bag, but it's really too dark to see inside. He reaches in and brings out a handful of assorted fireworks- crackers, Roman candles, twizzers, smoke bombs, etc.

<DIRECTION>
An expression of sublime delight fills MARTY'S face as he inventories these goodies.

He leaves. MARTY sits in his wheelchair, waving.

EXT. THE REAR OF THE COSLAW HOUSE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a downspout outside one of the upstairs windows. Now the window goes up and MARTY leans out. He grasps the downspout and begins working his way down. This should not be too hard for us to believe; we've already seen how strong MARTY'S arms are.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His legs dangle limply, but he's doing just fine. When he reaches the bottom of the drainpipe, they simply crumple under him and he uses his arms to pull himself over to the back porch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARTY hoists himself over the porch rail. Here, under a tarp, is the Silver Bullet. MARTY pushes the tarp aside and gets in. He uses his hands on the wheels to get over the porch ramp and rolls silently down it. At the bottom he looks up at:

MARTY comes slowly up the path. We hear soft grunts of exertion; he's still hand-turning the wheels for the sake of silence, and it's hard work. He stops at the line of bushes and gets the bag of fireworks. He puts it on his lap and starts moving again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE COSLAW DRIVEWAY, FROM THE ROAD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The driveway has a slight downslant, and MARTY coasts easily out to the road. He turns right and begins to roll slowly along the verge of the highway, still using his hands. We can see that the light is still on upstairs. MARTY turns back once to verify this himself, then keeps on going. He's not going to be deprived of his treat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MARTY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He decides he's far enough away to be safe. He pushes the starter button. The engine cranks, coughs, and cranks some more. MARTY frowns, and pulls out a wire- a rudimentary choke, I suppose. He pushes the starter button again. It cranks, but doesn't start.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARTY pushes in the wire, looking concerned now, and tries again. This time, after the engine has cranked over a few times, it starts.

The turnout is packed dirt. There's a grove of trees with picnic tables spotted among them at the back. The sign in the extreme f.g. reads ROADSIDE REST AREA at the top; AUGER FALLS in the middle; TOWNSHIP OF TARKER'S MILLS at the bottom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOUND: The Silver Bullet approaching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARTY turns in and rolls to the back of the rest area. He stops by one of the picnic tables and dumps the bag of fireworks out onto the picnic table and takes his time selecting the first- he's like a wine fancier with a whole cellar of rare bottles to choose from. At last he chooses a twizzer. He takes matches from the pocket of his pajama top and lights the fuse.

When it starts to fizz, MARTY tosses it high into the air.

It turns from the creek and gets up on its hind legs.

EXT. MARTY, IN THE REST AREA

He's getting ready to light one of the fountains. He pauses and looks toward the cut. He's heard something- but the waterfall muffles it. He lights the fountain's fuse, sets it on the ground, and rolls the Bullet back a few feet.

The fountain bursts into a shower of light.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's run into a low-hanging branch. Instead of pushing it aside or ducking under it, it simply rips it off the tree. Although the branch is pretty big, the WEREWOLF does this as easily as a hungry man might rip a drumstick off a Thanksgiving turkey. It throws the branch aside and advances, hunched over on two legs.

We can't see its face in the dark, but it's closer... much closer.

It recoils- we still can't see its face except for a vague shadow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(NOTE: I keep emphasizing the shadowed face, because this is not a full-moon period. I've been going on the assumption that the guy kind of works his way up to full wolfiness, toothiness, hairiness, etc., starting with a partial change at about the second quarter. It's a process like the tide coming in. Thus, if we saw MARTY'S attacker clearly at this point, I think we would recognize him.)

The tracer strikes it in the face, and we see a flash of fire. The WEREWOLF screams and blunders away.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He punches the starter again. The motor cranks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE MOTOR OF THE SILVER BULLET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The motor coughs and fires; a big blue flame jumps from the fancy carb... and the engine starts to run.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE WEREWOLF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's staggering away, ROARING and HOWLING. The tube of the tracer is sticking out of its face- from its left eye, in fact- like an Indian's arrow. The WEREWOLF smashes branches out of its way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MARTY IN THE SILVER BULLET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He wheels the Bullet around and heads for the road, gasping and weeping with fear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE WEREWOLF, IN THE GROVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's blundering through the trees. It pulls the tube from its face with an ANIMAL SCREAM and drops it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE TRACER, CU
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It lies smoldering on the ground. The end is slick with blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE ROAD, WITH MARTY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Bullet is really wheeling. MARTY is panting, out of breath, still deeply frightened.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE WOODS, WITH THE WEREWOLF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see it blundering along, holding its face; blood bubbles through its fingers.

	Bastard Marty! Bastard Marty! Kill you! Reeeal slow!

</WEREWOLF>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COSLAW DRIVEWAY, WITH MARTY

<DIRECTION>
He powers up it, and along the path to the back. Perhaps he has enough speed to cut the engine and coast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MARTY'S BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His bed is by the window. His hands appear on the windowsill, and MARTY pulls himself in. He falls over onto his bed and lies there, spent and exhausted and trembling.

EXT. THE COSLAW HOUSE, VERY EARLY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOUND: RINGING TELEPHONE (FILTER)

He's sitting in the "house" wheelchair in the living room, holding the phone tensely to his ear as the RINGING SOUND goes on.

INT. UNCLE AL'S BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Not a really spiffy place- the decor is Early American Alcoholic. There's a mostly unclad lady asleep on one side of the bed. UNCLE AL is sitting on the other in his skivvies, phone to his ear. There are a lot of bottles and heaped ashtrays around, and UNCLE AL has a big old hangover.

</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MAIN STREET, MEDIUM LONG, WITH JANE
</DIRECTION>

JANE is pushing a supermarket shopping cart with a lot of beer and soda bottles in it. On the side is a sign reading MEDCU BOTTLE AND CAN DRIVE- plus an outline drawing of the Medcu unit.

<JANE>

She turns into a yard and pulls her cart up the walk to the door. She mounts the steps and rings the bell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE PORCH, WITH JANE, A CLOSER SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sheer curtain at one side of the door is pulled aside and a fearful face- that of MRS. THAYER- looks out. Then we hear bolts being pulled and locks- at least three of them- being unlocked. The lady is taking no chances.

Amazing how deserted Tarker's Mills looks. JANE is pushing her cart. Even more bottles in it now.

<JANE>

(voice-over)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uncle Al hadn't believed him, but Uncle Al was thirty-five that summer and I was fourteen... at fourteen you can still believe the unbelievable, although even then that ability is growing rusty, is preparing to squeal to a stop.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
She is passing the Holy Family rectory. LESTER LOWE is out front, digging in his flower garden. He is shirtless, back to JANE and to us; his black shirt with the turned-around collar hangs informally on a bush.

EXT. JANE, FARTHER DOWN MAIN STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stops at Robertson's Luncheonette, leaves her cart outside, and goes in. THE CAMERA FLOATS TO THE WINDOW; we see JANE explaining about the bottle campaign to BOBBY while a few men seated at the counter listen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JANE, ECU

Wide eyes, mostly.

INT. THE MEN, JANE'S POV
</DIRECTION>

Some of them- PELTZER, VIRGIL CUTTS- are familiar. Others are not. THE CAMERA PANS THEIR FACES CLOSELY, FEATURING THEIR EYES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OUTSIDE ROBERTSON'S, WITH JANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She grabs the handle of the cart again and proceeds down Main Street. She goes into the barber shop.

<JANE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marty had seen where the tracer had struck home, he said, and I went out that day doing more than just looking for returnable cans and bottles- I was looking for a man- or woman- with only one eye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE BARBER SHOP DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As JANE enters, BILLY McCLAREN is giving one man a trim. Another man is tipped back with his face wrapped in a towel. Two or three other townies are waiting on tonsorial beautification, reading magazines. None, of course, has only one eye. JANE checks them all out carefully.
</DIRECTION>
<BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know what you're after, Jane, and you're out of luck. Little Toby Whittislaw was in yesterday, and I gave 'em all to him.

<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh... okay.

But her eyes have fixed on the towel over the face of the man in the other barber chair. She walks over to him.

EXT. JANE, AT THE RECTORY

She pushes the shopping cart up to the gate, opens it, and goes up the walk to the foot of LOWE'S porch steps. She leaves it there and climbs to the porch.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The screen door is shut, the inner wooden door open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE RECTORY HALLWAY, JANE'S POV

Dark and empty. SOUNDS in the kitchen. EATING SOUNDS, maybe- or maybe we can't tell.

She knocks on the screen door.

	Father Lowe! I'm ready to turn in my bottles and cans!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE KITCHEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOWE is standing by the refrigerator door. He's holding a raw leg of lamb and tearing at it with his teeth. Lamb blood smears his face and runs down his arms. He is as human as you or me (in a manner of speaking, as UNCLE AL would say), but when JANE speaks, his head snaps up and his eye flares- his one eye. The other is covered by a patch.

She goes down the steps and starts to push the cart around the house.

<DIRECTION>
He crosses to the window over the kitchen sink, the bloody chunk of meat still in his hands, and looks out.

EXT. JANE, LOWE'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She pushes the cart along a path toward a combination garage and utility shed at the back.

<DIRECTION>
Still watching JANE, he begins to gnaw ravenously at the meat again.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She opens the door and slowly pushes her cart inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE UTILITY SHED-GARAGE, WITH JANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is a creepy little place, now filled with bottles and cans that have been crammed in helter-skelter, every which way. JANE obviously doesn't like it. She begins to unload her cart rapidly, mumbling numbers to herself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOUND: SQUEAKING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JANE looks down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE UTILITY SHED-GARAGE FLOOR, JANE'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A good-sized mouse comes out from between a pile of stacked bottles and runs across JANE'S shoe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She utters a litle scream and shrinks back against the wall, bumping it quite hard. Hard enough to knock something off an overhead shelf. It falls into the bottles, SHATTERING several. JANE screams again- not terribly loud- and then slowly bends toward the object and picks it up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JANE holds it, both puzzled and scared.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE BACK DOOR OF THE RECTORY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JANE approaches it, holding a piece of paper in her hand- her tally sheet. She knocks. Waits. There is no answer. She knocks again. Waits. No answer. She tries the door. It opens.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>

	Father Lowe?

</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
No answer. After a moment of interior debate, JANE enters the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JANE, IN THE RECTORY KITCHEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks around. No one here. But there is a bloody spot on the counter- LOWE must have set his grisly luncheon down here for a moment. She walks slowly across the kitchen and into the dark hall.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Father Lowe?... I've got my tally sheet...

	<DIALOGUE>
	Good, Jane. Very... very good.

He's standing at the window and looking out. The torn-open envelope is on an end table beside him. He's holding the lined sheet of paper in his hand. An expression of bitter hate twists his features, and he slowly crumples the paper in his fist.

	What about the baseball bat Jane saw in his shed? You know who used to have a baseball bat like that? Mr. Knopfler! He was so proud of it he used to carry it in the Fourth of July parade! Jane said it looked like the Green Giant used it for a toothpick!

UNCLE AL squats, depositing MARTY in the Bullet. MARTY starts the engine as JANE hands UNCLE AL his ice cream cone. The three of them start up the street and THE CAMERA TRACKS THEM.

<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know exactly what I believe. But I know that what I saw was a baseball bat and not a broomstick. I know there was something strange about the way the house smelled that day. It smelled like an animal's den. And I believe in Marty. I mean- there are times when he makes me so mad I could kill him, but I still believe in him.

MARTY opens the throttle wide and the Bullet swerves across the road. The coupe's bumper actually clips it on the way by, jolting MARTY and almost overturning the Bullet.

He's in a teeth-grinding fury. He jams the gear-shift lever into reverse and floors the gas pedal again.

It roars backward in a cloud of ditch dust and bounces onto the road. Then it screams out after the rapidly disappearing Silver Bullet.

He hears the GROWLING SOUND of LESTER LOWE'S coupe. He looks behind.

He twists the throttle and the Silver Bullet responds.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. CHASE MONTAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The director will shoot it as he likes- the basis is simple: LOWE is chasing MARTY's hopped-up wheelchair along a country road at speeds approaching fifty MPH. MARTY should have a couple of near misses, and perhaps we could actually have him pass one car. At one point we should have a REVERSE ANGLE on LESTER LOWE'S coupe, featuring two bumper stickers: ATTEND AND SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL CHURCH and HONK IF YOU LOVE JESUS!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the chase goes on it becomes apparent that LOWE is gaining. MARTY looks increasingly desperate. And now he looks down at:

He groans. SOUND of the coupe's engine GROWS LOUDER.

LOWE charges, rapidly closing the distance. MARTY swerves from one side of the road to the other, escaping LOWE for the moment but almost overturning in the process.

They are now running beside a river- the Auger River, in fact.

It's pretty ramshackle. A big orange sign beside it reads: BRIDGE UNSAFE! TRUCKS AND AUTOS ABSOLUTELY PROHIBITED!

MARTY brakes, hits the shoulder of the road, and somehow makes the turn. We see him holding on for dear life as the Silver Bullet bounces and jounces down the dirt road to the mouth of the covered bridge.

It overshoots the right turn MARTY just took, screeches to a halt, backs up, and turns onto the lane.

EXT./INT. THE COVERED BRIDGE, WITH THE BULLET
</DIRECTION>

It's dim and spooky in here. Cracks between the boards of the side walls allow dusty fingers of daylight to shine through. More light rays up from the cracks in the floor. The floorboards are warped and uneven; MARTY'S wheelchair sways drunkenly from side to side. The total inside passage is about seventy feet.
</DIRECTION>

About halfway across, the Silver Bullet coughs its last cough and splutters its last splutter. It rolls along silently, going on its dying momentum.

Drawing closer. We hear the SOUNDS of boards rumbling under the Silver Bullet's tires and the Auger River beneath.

One of the turn-signal lamps is broken. There's a scratch in the paint and a dent in the bumper. HALLER'S fingers come into the frame and touch the scratch. They stop, and THE CAMERA ZOOMS IN to a small streak of silvery paint. As MARTY has a scrape of blue car paint on his wheelchair, so does LOWE have a scrape of silver wheelchair paint on his car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes widen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOUND: SHATTERING ROAR and the CLINK AND TUMBLE of about nine thousand cans as LOWE erupts from under the aluminum scrap heap behind HALLER. He is a mixture of man and werewolf, and quite clearly a beastial version of LOWE. In one hand he holds the remains of OWEN KNOPFLER'S peacemaker.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HALLER starts to turn; LOWE strikes him with the bat. CAMERA CLOSES IN ON LOWE as the bat rises and falls... rises and falls. We can't see HALLER, and that is probably a mercy, but we can hear the THUD of the bat as it strikes again and again and again.

EXT. THE REST AREA AT AUGER FALLS, WITH MARTY, AL, JANE DAY

UNCLE AL has taken the Coslaw family station wagon today. The three of them are sitting in the grove of trees.

UNCLE AL is taking the kids home- THE CAMERA TRACKS the wagon for a moment, and then we are looking up the short lane and into a gravel pit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAMERA ZOOMS IN, FAST, on the sandy rear wall. We can see one cowboy boot sticking out of a wall of sand. It's bloody and chewed.

EXT./INT. SILVER BULLET MONTAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
a.) UNCLE AL pulls up to a city store front with a sign reading MAC'S GUNS AND AMMO. He takes out the St. Cristopher's medal, looks at it, and shakes his head, as if still ruing his own credulity and stupidity. He goes inside.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(voice-over)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uncle Al's friend Mac was more than a gunsmith; he was, Uncle Al said, an old-world craftsman, a sort of wizard of weapons.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
b.) In the gun shop interior, we see UNCLE AL talking to MAC, who really should look like an elderly white wizard- a kind of Gandalf figure. In the b.g. window we see a paper skeleton and paper jack-o'-lanterns: our first clue that All Hallow's Eve is nearing. UNCLE AL is speaking animatedly, using his hands a lot; we don't know exactly what the tale is, but it must be a whopper. In the course of it, he hands the medal and the crucifix to MAC, who tents the silver chains over his fingers and looks at them.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(v-o continues)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God knows what sort of story my uncle told him, but I think that for men who have been married as often as Uncle Al, invention on short notice becomes something of a specialty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
c.) In his workroom, we see MAC spilling boron over the medal and looking closely at the stain.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(v-o continues)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The gunsmith confirmed the high-grade silver content of my crucifix and Marty's medallion...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
d.) In a dim shot which makes MAC look more like a sorcerer than ever, we see him light an acetylene torch and begin melting the medal and the crucifix in the crucible. THE CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY IN as JANE'S contribution and MARTY'S melt together; they are becoming on and indissoluble.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(v-o continues)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

MAC comes out of the back with a small inlaid wooden box. He puts it down on the glass counter top.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here it is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE BOX, CU
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MAC'S hands open it, disclosing a single bullet resting on dark velvet plush. It is a .22 short round, and it gleams a pure silver. It would be great to hype this bullet optically- not much, just a little- to make it look absolutely magical. Almost holy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MAC AND UNCLE AL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNCLE AL picks up the bullet almost reverently, holds it to the light.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nicest piece of work I ever did, I think. It's got a low-grain load so it won't tumble. Should be pretty accurate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<UNCLE_AL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's just a gag, that's all. What would you shoot a silver .22 bullet at, anyway?

	By the time Marty's silver bullet was done, it was Halloween... and the full moon had come around again. Earlier that afternoon, my grandfather, who had been dying of cancer for over seven years, finally finished the job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAMERA PANS DOWN to the COSLAW house. There's a carved jack in the window and a corsage of Indian corn on the door. UNCLE AL'S MG is in the driveway. The COSLAW station wagon is just backing out. UNCLE AL and JANE stand in the doorway; MARTY is slightly behind them in the Silver Bullet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NAN leans out of the car. She's wearing black, and she has obviously been crying.

DIM SOUND OF TV SNOW.

UNCLE AL is shaking his burned hand; he picks the cigarette out of his lap and puts it out.

UNCLE AL whirls, raising the pistol automatically to fire- but the cylinder is rolled out and all the chambers are empty. He has time to register surprise before the WEREWOLF smashes him aside.

<DIRECTION>
INT. JANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She tosses it awkwardly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE GUN, SLOW MOTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It slides down the hall floor to MARTY like some strange, awkward shuffleboard disc, its cylinder still open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE WEREWOLF
</DIRECTION>
<WEREWOLF>
<DIRECTION>
(snarls)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maa-aaa-rty...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEREWOLF>
<DIRECTION>
It begins walking slowly across the living room, smashing things out of its way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MARTY, IN THE HALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The gun slides into his hand. Now he reaches into the heating duct again...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. IN THE HEATING DUCT, ECU
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's an elbow bend just below MARTY'S twisting, grasping fingers- the silver bullet lies here. It's less than half an inch out of reach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE WEREWOLF, CU
</DIRECTION>
<WEREWOLF>
<DIRECTION>
(foaming)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

INT. JANE, ON THE FLOOR
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(sobbing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you hurt him! Don't you hurt my brother!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
She bites one of the WEREWOLF'S hairy ankles as it passes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JANE AND THE WEREWOLF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It roars with pain and kicks her aside. Then it looks back into the hall. It is grinning. I believe it is thinking this is going to be better than a Thanksgiving dinner you don't have to pay for.
</DIRECTION>
<WEREWOLF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Reeeal slow, Maa-aaarty-
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEREWOLF>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MARTY, CU
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's reaching desperately into the duct and staring at the approaching WEREWOLF.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. IN THE HEATING DUCT, ECU
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARTY'S fingers brush the bullet once... again... seize it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MARTY, IN THE HALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He rolls over on his back and sticks the silver bullet blindly into one chamber of the cylinder and slams the cylinder closed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE WEREWOLF, CU
</DIRECTION>
<WEREWOLF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bastard Marty!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEREWOLF>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MARTY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He points the gun and pulls the trigger. There's only a click. An expression of dismay on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE WEREWOLF, CU
</DIRECTION>
<WEREWOLF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kill you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEREWOLF>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MARTY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He drags himself so he's half propped against the hall wall. He pulls the trigger again. Click! Dismay becomes fear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE WEREWOLF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's reached the Silver Bullet. It smashes it aside. The Bullet hits the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MARTY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holding the gun in both hands now, he pulls the trigger a third time. Click!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The WEREWOLF'S shadow falls over him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WEREWOLF, ECU
</DIRECTION>
<WEREWOLF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bastard Marty!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEREWOLF>
<DIRECTION>
It bends down, reaching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MARTY, ECU
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Craning back as if to drive himself into the wall, he pulls the trigger again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE BARREL OF THE .22 MAXI-CLOSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bullet flies from the barrel, gleaming silver.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE WEREWOLF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The silver bullet strikes him in his one remaining eye. He flies backward, hands clapped to his gushing face... and crashes into MARTY'S Silver Bullet wheelchair. It sits there, roaring... and then it begins to change.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE LIVING ROOM, WITH JANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She lies there, sobbing.
</DIRECTION>
<UNCLE_AL>
<DIRECTION>
(voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You okay, Janey?
	</DIALOGUE>
</UNCLE_AL>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UNCLE AL AND JANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNCLE AL is bloody and staggering but on his feet. He helps JANE up.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm all right... but Marty! Ma-
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
SOUND: SHATTERING ROAR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE WEREWOLF, ECU
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Its hands drop from its face. It is now blind in both eyes; it is half WEREWOLF and half LOWE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It BELLOWS again, convulses... and dies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MARTY, ON THE FLOOR
</DIRECTION>
<MARTY>
<DIRECTION>
(calls)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm all right. He's dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UNCLE AL AND JANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Here's a creature that is mostly FATHER LOWE collapsed in the remains of MARTY'S wheelchair; beyond it, MARTY is lying on the floor. UNCLE AL goes by the corpse. JANE starts by... and LOWE sits bolt upright for a moment, grasping blindly at her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She shrieks and darts aside. LOWE falls back, now really dead. I think. Until the sequel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE HALL, WITH UNCLE AL, JANE, AND MARTY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNCLE AL puts a comforting arm around JANE, who is sobbing again- hell, I'd be sobbing after that last one, myself- and draws her down beside himself and MARTY.
</DIRECTION>
<UNCLE_AL>
<DIRECTION>
(to MARTY)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There. I told you there weren't any such things as werewolves.
	</DIALOGUE>
</UNCLE_AL>
<DIRECTION>
They smile at each other with love.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(nervous)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you sure it's dead? Or him? Or whatever it is?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<UNCLE_AL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If it isn't now, it will be after I pound one of your mother's silver candlesticks through its heart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</UNCLE_AL>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(grimaces)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh Uncle Al, no!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<UNCLE_AL>
<DIRECTION>
(grim)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yes, Janey. When I believe something, I believe it all the way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</UNCLE_AL>
<DIRECTION>
He gets up and leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you all right, Marty?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<MARTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All except my legs... I don't think I can walk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTY>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a real booger, you know it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<MARTY>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you, Jane.

EXT. TARKER'S MILLS, LONG NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quiet. Sleeping.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(voice-over)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It wasn't always easy for me to answer that... but I could answer it that night, and I find I can say it now that the terrible events of that fall have receded to memories which seem little more than dreams in my mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE HALLWAY, WITH MARTY AND JANE
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAMERA PANS UP to the full moon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT.
