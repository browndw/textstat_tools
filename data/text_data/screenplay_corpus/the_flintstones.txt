Fred and company pull in. He takes a giant sea shell "speaker" off of its wooden stand and hooks it to his car door. He leans over, puts his arm around Wilma. (In the back seat, Dino pops his head up, tearing through the canvas top.) Dino picks up Pebbles and Bam-Bam and puts them on his head for a better view. CAMERA ZOOMS IN ON the drive-in screen and the words that America has waited twenty-five years to see in 70mm Dolby(TM) drop- your-popcorn reality: THE FLINTSTONES And as the MAIN CREDITS ROLL, we -- DISSOLVE TO:

AN EERIE CARBONIFEROUS FOREST - DAWN

Dew drips from strange multi-leafed plants. Giant DRAGONFLIES BUZZ AND HUM to and fro. Bubbles rise from a still pond, and weird lungfish move onto the land. (The third one out carries a little suitcase.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PANS PAST the lungfish TO a muddy shore. With a DRAMATIC MUSICAL STING, we DISCOVER a set of strange, hideous clawprints. The CAMERA FOLLOWS these, then WIDENS to reveal the make of these footprints: A seven- foot tall and fearful beast we will call the Xenosaurus. It looks around menacingly. (Oddly, it's carrying a canvas sack, but we don't stress this.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly a garbage truck appears out of nowhere and runs over the Xenosaurus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dazed, the Xenosaurus gets up. As it does, we realize that we aren't deep in some primeval forest, but on the shoulder of a gravel highway. A stone road sign reads BEDROCK 1/2 MILE. ROCK VEGAS, BABYLON & EDEN NEXT THREE EXITS. Now, the CAMERA CRANES UP ABOVE the sign and we see -- Bedrock!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nestled incongruously in a savage landscape, the charming protosuburbia gleams in the dawn's early Spielberg light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Xenosaurus grabs its sack and some silverware spills out. Then it runs off into the bushes and out of sight.

WITH THAT GARBAGE TRUCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It reaches the crest of a hill where there's a "WELCOME TO BEDROCK" billboard which bears greetings from the Rotary Club, the Chamber of Commerce, and (of course) The Loyal Order of Water Buffaloes. The garbage truck guys drop their feet down through the floorboard and trot over the rise, coast down to the street below. The driver yanks a wooden brake and the truck stops, and the rear guys hop off. One of them waves to --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MILKMAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
who returns the wave, then takes a four-pack of stone bottles out of his milk truck, heads towards a doorway. As the milkman drops off the milk, he passes a big TORTOISE with trash cans on its back. The Tortoise nods familiarly to the milkman, then it waddles down the curb, CAMERA FOLLOWING. The garbage men take the cans off the Tortoise's back, dump them into the truck.

It waddles back up the lawn... passing by a wooden "lawn timer" box which now pops open. Inside the box is a "ROOSTERSAURUS" which CROWS and flaps its wings. The motion of the wings knocks loose two round stones which roll down two long troughs a la Rube Goldberg...

FOLLOWING THE ROUND STONES

They reach the ends of their respective paths, dislodging a stick... that releases a coiled rope which in turn spins a turntable which holds a little wooly mammoth. As it begins to spin around, it squirts water out of its snout.

Elsewhere on the lawn, other spinning MAMMOTHS repeat this performance. After a moment, they gradually slow their revolutions. The one closest to the house scrunches its trunk with a GROAN.

Two shapes are visible under the bedclothes: One is a great SNORING bulge, the other is a svelte and lithe shape. As the BELL continues RINGING, the larger bulge GRUNTS, MOANS, pulls a pillow over its head, and then finally gropes under the bed for a slipper. The slipper is thrown without aiming --

Meanwhile, Wilma turns at the sound of the TOASTER POPPING UP. We see that the "claws" we saw earlier were the actual claws of a LOBSTER in a little fireproof suit who is tucked inside the toaster. As Wilma takes the toast, the Lobster blows on his claws, wincing, then looks TOWARDS the CAMERA.

</FRED>

He takes his hand off the wheel to hold up two fingers... ends up swerving instead.
</DIRECTION>
<FRED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- just like that. I know, I know -- you're not a clock-punching guy -- but face it, Barney -- it's time to grow up and put your nose to the grindstone, batten down the hatches and join the ratasaurus race with the rest of us.

	<DIALOGUE>
	It's time to retire those dreams.

	Yeah, those were the days... we usta dream about coming back here some day with a real car and goin' for the goldrock...!

A look from one to another, and then down the hill... Fred gets a malicious grin on his face.

</FRED>
<DIRECTION>
The two pals laugh, and then with a whoop they begin pedalling like mad. They go over the top, gravity takes over and they are flying past that billboard with all the Rotary Club welcomes on it. But now we see a different sort of welcome, as a POLICE CAR ZOOMS out from behind it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POLICE CAR - CLOSER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside are SERGEANT FELDSPAR and his rookie partner, OFFICER GRAVEL. Cackling with anticipation, Feldspar opens a box marked radar detector. Out pops a little bird in a police helmet. It has a stopwatch (actually, stop-sundial) around its neck. Feldspar points -- the bird salutes -- takes off!

Suddenly both Fred and Barney see the RADAR BIRD flying alongside them. It checks its stopwatch, writes a note to itself. Fred is so preoccupied he doesn't notice as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE POLICE CAR

<DIRECTION>
cuts in front of Fred. Fred SLAMS on the "BRAKES," sits helplessly as Feldspar gets out, walks over, grinning.

	Well, Flintstone, looks like today's the day.

Fred opens the box. A scary-looking winged reptile sticks out its head, smacks its hungry lips.

<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE

Confident, Feldspar jerks a thumb at the Radar Bird, turns to his rookie partner.
</DIRECTION>
<FELDSPAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gravel. Get me the radar reading and I'll show you how we deal with scofflaws.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELDSPAR>

Gravel nods, steps towards the bird. The bird checks its stopwatch... and then it notices the flying lizard which is hovering nearby, licking its lips.
</DIRECTION>
<RADAR_BIRD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa! Wings, do your stuff -- !
	</DIALOGUE>
</RADAR_BIRD>

The Radar Bird flies away at a hundred miles an hour, leaving a cloud of dust and the stopwatch behind. Feldspar catches the watch, startled.

	Well, Sergeant, if you don't have a radar reading, I guess we'll --

Inside the window we see a LITTLE BIRD. It "bites" the coin to check it, then turns over an egg timer.

with a sigh, they buckle on elbow and knee protectors, go to a side door, open it. Inside is another barred door. They open it, go inside. Immediately we hear loud SQUAWKING and CACKLING... THUDS, BUMPS...

<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE

Suddenly the barred door slams open and a giant chicken- saurus comes bounding out, with Morris's staff hanging all over it like rodeo cowboys. They try and restrain it with ropes but it's enraged and flops around the store.

EXT. SLATE CONSTRUCTION - DAY

Clouds of dust rise from behind the fence. We see the heads of the heavy equipment dinos rising and falling. A two-story office building is at one end of the site with a big "Slate Construction Inc." sign on the roof. CAMERA ADJUSTS as Fred's car turns into the lot, Barney seated beside Fred. The new green hood gleams in the morning light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER - FRED'S CAR
</DIRECTION>

Fred digs his feet into the ground, slams to a halt. He gets out, surveys the activity. Immediately, the various workers shout AD LIB greetings. Fred acknowledges these, beaming in the respect he gets here.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He lovingly dusts off his construction helmet, puts it on, knocks an offending speck from his parking sign (F. Flintstone - Shop Steward). He leads Barney towards the quarry area.
</DIRECTION>
<FRED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Barney, you won't regret this -- hiya, Al -- fixing dents in cars is one thing, a career's another. Here, you're getting in on the ground floor of the first footstep of a new leaf -- hi, Wally, how's the old backhand?

Fred smiles at her, hands the forms to Barney. Fres steps towards the quarry, admires the activity, hands on hips, master of all he surveys. He waves to more friends.

	Well, Barn, what did I tell you? When you're in with Flintstone, you're in like Flint.

	Gee, Fred. I knew you were a big shot. I just didn't know how big.

Fred beams at that, and then follows Barney's gaze to the read-out on the truck scale. Fred is standing on it and it's pushing 250. With a scowl, Fred grabs Barney's sleeve and they go into the quarry. As they move, the CAMERA PANS and CRANES UP TOWARDS the window of the Slate Construction Office.

INT. OFFICE - PULLBACK FROM WINDOW

The room here is dominated by a tabletop architectural model of a large scale construction project. There's acres of little development houses, then some tall office buildings, a mall, you name it: There's even little foot- powered model cars in the model parking spaces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Near this we see MR. SLATE, a giant in the Bedrock con- struction business (but not in height). Slate drinks coffee from a "Boss" mug, listens with growing impatience to JERRY LAVA. Several of Slate's lackeys listen, their heads nodding up or down in sympathy with Slate's mer- curial moods.

Fred and Barney cross the busy lot, sidestepping workers and animals. Fred does a lot of backslapping, waving. Barney's filling out the forms on the move. Behind them, we see the wide access ramp which spirals around the quarry's sides.

Hearing a loud SMASH, Fred looks up and sees --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FRED'S POV - A WRECKING BALL OPERATOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A burly and rough looking guy named PILTDOWN, he grins in- side his dino-topping cupola, winds his winch handles and then propels his wrecking ball towards the...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
QUARRY WALL - ABOVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- where the huge stone BALL SMASHES into some walnuts balanced on a boulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Piltdown's compact buddy PYRITE cackles, sweeps up the walnuts. Munching them, he balances a new one in place. (It should be noted here that the relationship and physi- cal appearances of Piltdown and Pyrite mirrors that of our heroes... they're sort of an anti-Fred and Barney.)

Pyrite tosses a walnut, which bounces on the ledge. The wrecking BALL SMASHES into the stone wall.

Workers near Fred duck as dust and debris fall down. People grab for their construction helmets.

Fred hustles up a ladder to a ramp which leads him up to the level of Piltdown's cab. Barney hurries to follow.

	All right, Piltdown, that's enough! You're endangering your fellow workers!

He swings the wrecking ball again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UP ABOVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This time he's overdone it: The wrecking ball flies past the walnuts -- Pyrite ducks for cover -- and then the wrecking ball whips over and around the handrail which runs along here, twisting as tightly as Indiana Jones' whip. The handrail wobbles dangerously in its foundation --
</DIRECTION>

SNORTS, backs up -- the crane SUPPORTS on its back begin to CREAK and GROAN with the strain --

He calms the beast by giving it a carrot. As it munches, Fred quickly ties the reins to a post.

Men and ANIMALS YELP and dive out of the way as the BALL rolls downwards, SMASHING everything in its path.

The executives watch concerned as --

<DIRECTION>
THE WRECKING BALL

tumbles down, down, knocking scaffolding and ladders aside, reaches the end of a ramp, and drops through the air right onto --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE HOOD OF FRED'S CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- where, astonishingly, the HOOD sinks in resiliently like a trampoline and then with a loud "SPROING" the wrecking ball flies straight back up into the air, followed a beat behind by the unhinged hood itself. Both hurtle TOWARDS the CAMERA --

SLATE AND EXECUTIVES

react fearfully as they realize all this is coming straight for them. With a howl, they all dive aside --

INT. SLATE'S OFFICE - WIDER - DAY

<DIRECTION>
The wrecking BALL flies through the window, SLAMS onto Slate's desk, crushing everything in its path and then sails on SMASHING right into --

THE MODEL DEVELOPMENT

<DIRECTION>
-- where all of the lined up HIGH RISES SMASH ASIDE with a sound like falling pins.

INT. SLATE'S OFFICE - DAY

Dust is still settling. The staff rises from the mess, coughing. Lava rummages in the debris, finds a stiff body.
</DIRECTION>
<LAVA>

	Uncle, Uncle, speak to me --

</SLATE>
<DIRECTION>
Slate's eyes fall on Fred's car hood, swinging from a bookshelf. He reaches for it -- pulls it -- it stays put, and only releases a new deluge of rubble and plaster which reburies him. At the same time, the door slams open and Fred, Barney and the other workers tumble inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THEIR POV - OFFICE

As they take in the destruction. Barney notices the wrecking ball amidst the model buildings. As we watch, the last remaining little HIGH RISE FALLS.

Slate staggers to his feet, seething with fury. He finally yanks the car hood free. It bounces and VIBRATES in his hands like a hand saw.

One wall of the lodge displays a big version of the lodge coat of arms (with the motto "Ackus Ackus Adackus" below); a trophy case holds a mind boggling display of various bowling trophies, balls and pins. At the lectern, the HERDMASTER (a mustachioed, inspirational type) bangs again for order.

Barney stands, acknowledges his friends and Lodge brothers.

<BARNEY>

Seated across the room with Pyrite and other cronies, he immediately leaps to his feet, paws the ground, and gives an eerie moan even stranger than the Herdmaster's earlier call to order.

<HERDMASTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Brother Piltdown: You have given the Cry of the Gelded Buffalo at the Poisoned Water Hole. Do you wish to file an objection?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HERDMASTER>
<PILTDOWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You bet I do. How come Flintstone is 'good old Fred' and me and the other candidates are just 'some other guys'?

(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... plus the one and only Fred Flintstone!

Cheers go up, which drown out Piltdown's renewed cry of the poisoned water hole. Fred moves towards the podium as the noise dies down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barney moves to the wall, where he pulls a rolled up tapestry from a hiding place behind a plant. He tacks it to the wall, yanks a string. It unrolls. It's a big "VOTE FOR FRED FLINTSTONE" poster. Barney turns, gives Fred a "thumbs up," and as he does, Barney's hand brushes against a folded parchment in his pocket. Barney pushes his way through the seats, catches up to Fred and hands him the document. Fred takes it, continues up to the podium. There, the Herdmaster hands Fred the ceremonial hoof and antler, crossed over each other like a Pharaoh's badges of office.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fred does a Papal-like wave with these, sets them down, and unrolls the crib notes Barney gave him.

	Brother Buffaloes, honored Herdmaster, Junior Bucks and Apprentice Antlers, a great good evening to you all. Ahem. As you know, our organization has survived difficult times that have seen the extinction of such other lodges as the Order of Whooping Cranes and Brotherhood of Giant Sloths. But we here have come through the croo ... the crux...

MONTAGE - ASSEMBLY LINE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now, accompanied by heroic "industrial"-type MUSIC, we see the Fibrerock assembly line in full operation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This cannot be described now with appropriate justice, but it involves a series of animal-powered conveyor belts, Rube Goldberg-like funnels, spouts and chutes, and all sorts of gadgets, gizmos, bells and whistles, to wit:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At one end of the building, dino-powered dumpsters and lifters drop off all the ingredients; these get stomped/ chewed/bashed and otherwise reduced to powder, which is then (courtesy of some squirting Mastodans) mixed with water into a foam, which bubbles through a long sawmill- type trough and is held back by a gate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile, we see a sample item (in this case, a stone sofa) as it is placed before two "goatasauruses" which butt heads and smash the sofa between the two halves of a clay mold. When the mold is opened and the sofa tossed aside, Barney appears and personally "aims" the foam trough at a funnel in the top of the mold. Pausing to "taste" the mix, he smiles, then shouts --
</DIRECTION>
<BARNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ready... aim... fibre!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARNEY>
<DIRECTION>
Barney pulls a rope which opens the trough. "Fibrefoam" pours into the mold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CLAY MOLD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
gets "winched" unpwards by monkeys, and then an alliga- torsaurus whaps it with its tail.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BELOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Presto! A Fibrerock copy of the stone sofa drops neatly out of the mold, bounces lightly on the conveyor belt below! It sparkles with the tell-tale celadon-green shimmer of Fibrerock. As it chugs along, the process repeats, and soon a score of identical sofas is in view.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
END OF ASSEMBLY LINE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as a beaming Fred watches, workers easily stack the Fibrerock sofas (often one-handed). Nearby, we see Fibrerock window frames, doors, chairs, etc.

REAR OF QUARRY - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Fred pulls into the lot, slams his feet down to stop -- we hear SKIDDING -- they fishtail all over, slam right through a storage area for crates and barrels which collapse all around them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally they slam broadside into the main Quarry build- ing, knocking a hole in the wall.

NEW ANGLE

<DIRECTION>
Fred and Barney cough in the rising dust. Neither one of them sees what we see, which is that visible in the hole in the wall is the Slate Company's granite-doored safe...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... and right beside it is the Xenosaurus, which now jumps up, startled, dropping a crowbar and a big hand drill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Recovering its composure, the Xenosaurus grabs up the tools as well as a big canvas bag and tiptoes away, vanishing just as our heroes stir.

INT. ASSEMBLY LINE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the workers continue their rampage, Piltdown and Pyrite reappear.
</DIRECTION>
<PYRITE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Darn that Flintstone and Rubble... they're gonna screw everything up...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PYRITE>
<PILTDOWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not if we give 'em a nice long vacation... in the hospital.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PILTDOWN>
<DIRECTION>
Saying this, he grips tightly on a wrench. Then some rampaging workers rush by. Piltdown gives them an encour- aging cheer, and then he and Pyrite lead them up some stairs to the assembly line catwalk. There, Pyrite begins SMASHING some LIGHT FIXTURES with a club, while Piltdown uses brute strength to snap big support beams which he flings below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE - PYRITE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Winds up for another baseball-type swing -- but as he follows through, the ball-shaped light fixture jerks up on its cable. Unable to stop in time, Pyrite spins around, falls on his ass. Barney drops down INTO VIEW, hanging horizontally from the rafters. He's holding the light fixture with his free hand.
</DIRECTION>
<BARNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stee-rike one! Heh-hey. Ready for a curve ball?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARNEY>
<DIRECTION>
Pyrite doesn't have a sense of humor; club in hand, he jumps up, starts chasing Barney through the rafters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PILTDOWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spits on his hand, grabs another big beam. He pulls down on it... but it doesn't snap, it goes right up again. Puzzled, he pulls down on it again... there's another see-saw motion... ... This time Piltdown goes with the flow, pushes up and peers under the beam...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE

<DIRECTION>
Fred is hanging on the other end.

<FRED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Brother Piltdown... can we talk about this, antler to antler?

<DIRECTION>
Piltdown roars, begins slamming the girder up and down.
</DIRECTION>
<FRED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guess not...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRED>
<DIRECTION>
Fred inches down the shuddering beam, jumps off. Freed of Fred's weight, the other end "BOINGS" down on Piltdown's head. He groans, recovers in time to chase after Fred.
</DIRECTION>

BARNEY AND PYRITE

<DIRECTION>
Square off in the rafters.
</DIRECTION>
<BARNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give me your best shot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARNEY>
<DIRECTION>
Pyrite swings. Barney ducks and Pyrite SMASHES a WINDOW pane. Barney dodges again and the same thing happens. Getting cocky, Barney does it one more time...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... but this time the window is hinged in the center and the swivel action after the hit whaps Barney on the back and knocks him into Pyrite's next blow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FRED
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Is backpedaling away from Piltdown on the upper super- structure of the assembly line. Fred scrapes one foot in an arc in front of him.
</DIRECTION>
<FRED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dare you to cross that line.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRED>
<DIRECTION>
Piltdown crosses it.
</DIRECTION>
<FRED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That line.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRED>
<DIRECTION>
Piltdown crosses it. Fred "marks" another one. Piltdown doesn't even wait for the challenge, takes a giant step. Oops. Bad idea: The last "line" was at the edge of a straight drop! Piltdown yelps, "treads air" in the best cartoon manner -- and then desperately grabs a handful of Fred's clothing! Both men fall -- at the last minute Piltdown catches a ladder!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BELOW - ASSEMBLY LINE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fred lands with a thud right in the clay mold used to form the Fibre products! Worse, the impact arouses the goatasauruses out of their sleep. Dutifully, they rise, and then ram both sides of the mold just as Fred is struggling to his feet! Fred's yell is muffled by the clay.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OTHER ASSEMBLY LINE ANIMALS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Aroused by the "start up" of the assembly line, they do their job. Fibre foam begins to chug down the trough: The alligator crane picks up the mold, shakes it.

<DIRECTION>
FRED
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is flung to the conveyor belt, stiffly caked in clay.

THE FIBRE MOLD

The real Fred, moving stiffly like a robot, is getting to his feet when his Fibre doppleganger slams him to the mat again! A moment later, another "Fred" drops down beside him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PILTDOWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Has descended the ladder, hopping mad. Now, he sees Fred coming toward him... Piltdown breaks a big lever off the equipment, swings -- reacts astonished as "FRED" SHATTERS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FRED
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Back down the line, he's seen this. His clay-caked Adam's apple gulps. Quickly, he turns and tries to "tip-toe" away -- then, with a CREAK and CRUNCH -- the clay and Fibre all over him solidifies! Desperate, he tries to move... can't!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PILTDOWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watches, confused, as dozens of Fred Flintstones chug towards him on the belt. He shrugs, smashes the next one in line. Another phoney. He smashes the next one... CUT TO:

<DIRECTION>
UP ABOVE - BARNEY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dodging Pyrite's renewed attack. Now, Barney becomes aware of the activated assembly line. Getting an idea, he moves behind an inspection table, grabs a big rubber stamp. Pyrite comes around the corner... Barney's head butts him in the gut, dodges under his legs! Then, as Pyrite stumbles, Barney stamps his ass with the word "REJECT." Pyrite looks back, sees this, reddens... raises his club.
</DIRECTION>
<PYRITE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Reject, huh? Whaddya say we reject your head?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PYRITE>
<DIRECTION>
He raises the club... when an alligator swings down and grabs him by the seat of his pants! Pyrite drops the club, howls --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The alligator crane swings him away and over a big bin marked REJECTS -- and drops him. Howling, Pyrite falls into a big bin of broken and defective Fibrerock goods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BARNEY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chuckles to himself... and then looks down, reacts. CAMERA ADJUSTS and we see that Piltdown has smashed yet another of the duplicate Freds. Worried, Barney looks around, sees that he's just above the Fibrefoam chute. Without another thought, he jumps into it -- slides downward like a passenger on the Magerock Mountain Log Flume ride --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BELOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Piltdown is about to swing at the real Fred -- when Barney sails out of the end of the chute and slams into him and Fred! All three of them roll across the floor towards --

THE END OF THE BUILDING

<DIRECTION>
where a squad of policemen has just appeared -- led by a dripping wet Feldspar and Gravel!
</DIRECTION>
<FELDSPAR>

	All right! You're all under arr --

</FELDSPAR>
<DIRECTION>
Wham! Barney, Fred and Piltdown roll right into the cops, who go flying like (what else?) tenpins, complete with appropriate sound.

<BARNEY>
<DIRECTION>
(sitting up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whattya know. Even got the spare again...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARNEY>
<DIRECTION>
Then he gasps as he looks over at Fred, whose head has just fallen off! Pause. Fred's real head slowly pokes up out of the clay and Fibre shoulders. Before he can extricate himself further, Feldspar and his men are dragging them out of the building. CUT TO:

Slate and Lava are examining a newer and larger model of Slate City. It's even more grandiose than its predecessor. Now the housing development has two huge office buildings beside it, and then a convention center beyond that.
</DIRECTION>

Lava breaks off. He's just looked out the window and seen --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LAVA'S POV - QUARRY BELOW WINDOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small figure appears behind some of the equipment, tiptoeing from console to cabinet and thus towards the assembly line. Wearing sunglasses with attached nose and a hook-on beard, it at first appears to be some sort of bizarre hermit or bum... and then we realize, hey, this is Barney!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LAVA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looks around, spots Piltdown and Pyrite, now resplendent in security guard uniforms. Lava whistles softly to get their attention, can't. Then he sees one of Slate's golf trophies. He shrugs, throws it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BELOW - PILTDOWN

Reacts as the trophy bounces off his head, then looks up to see Lava gesticulating. Piltdown nods, grabs Pyrite in tow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BARNEY

<DIRECTION>
Looking around carefully, Barney takes out a Thermos bottle, unscrews the top, and quickly dunks it into the Fibrerock foam. Then he tiptoes O.S., right into the massive bulk of --

PILTDOWN

	Fred, this was supposed to be a 'typical evening' at the Flintstones, and you invited fifty people I don't even know. Now what's going on? Where are they taking my ficus-sauruses?

He starts away, suddenly notices his own barbecue and trikes... quickly, without missing a stride, he tosses a tarp over them, slides a potted plant over for good measure.

BARNEY AND BETTY'S HOUSE - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Betty, hair and face done, but still in a slip, is putting a reluctant Bam-Bam into a cute little blazer. In the f.g., Barney finishes tying a black tie, then struggles into a dinner jacket.

Both react to the sound of HAMMERING and SAWING. Curious, they go out the sliding bedroom door into the yard and see --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THEIR POV - THE FENCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The television crew has just finished nailing boards up over the top of the fence. Now the big potted plants are dropped into place. With each hammer stroke or thud a little more of the late afternoon sun is shut off until Barney and Betty are in shadow. Finally a canvas tarp is tossed as gracefully as pizza dough, sails into the Rubble yard and covers their bird bath. One last stray end lands on Barney's head.

CLOSE ON "SLATE NEEDLE" AND FIBRESPHERE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Both decorated in pennants and bunting, connected to each other by a gangway six stories up. Block letters on the Fibresphere proclaim "Slate Construction brings you THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF FIBRE." A heroic statue of Slate himself stands close by the structures. (Sphere and needle, of course, are dead on parodies of the Trylon and Perisphere, centerpieces of the '39 World's Fair.) A limousine pedaled by two chauffeurs pulls up. Mr. and Mrs. Slate and Lava, and Lava's son, POINDEXTER, get out. It is immediately evident that the little obnoxious acorn hasn't fallen far from the tree.

They head for the mastodon and pully-powered elevator. Standing there are Piltdown and Pyrite, both in security guard uniforms. (Piltdown is carrying a vaguely-familiar satchel).

Completely covered in the ferocious-looking suit, Fred steps over to Barney, stabs an angry claw in his direction.

	All they've been doing is using us, Barney. And meanwhile --

Now Fred reaches up to take the head off. It sticks for a moment. Finally he gets it to flip back on its hinge where it hangs behind his neck like a ski parka hood.

</BARNEY>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, with a GROWING CREAKING, CRACKING and TINKLING, a scale model of Slate City in the corner begins to fall apart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fred and Barney look at each other, startled, then rush over to the model. It's the interim version we saw earlier.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER - MODEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The decomposition continues, walls and supports turning into sand and running down before our eyes. In a Rube Goldberg-like continuum, the little houses go first, falling like dominoes...

Barney tries to stop the process, can't.

Suddenly Barney gets it. He looks from the older models to the now decomposing little Fibresphere with growing awareness.

With a final WHIMPER, the little FIBRESPHERE CAVES IN and then the nearby SLATE NEEDLE CRUMBLES, model story by model story. Finally the "DISK" on top of the needle is all that's left, wobbling around like a spun dinner plate. It finally falls... EXPLODES.

Barney runs to a locker, grabs a big plunger-powered flit gun, begins filling it with a red liquid.

	Coo-coo berry sap, Fred! It's our only chance -- their only chance!

Lava laughs, sure she's kidding... then not so sure. The ventriloquist finishes to scattered applause. The kid bows, gets up... splashes across puddles of water on the stage area. The Headmistress of L'ecole Superior et al steps up. Behind her, the picture window displays the expanse of Slate City: The twin Slatescrapers framing endless rows of little tract houses stretching to the distant volcanic ridge.

He's said this last because as he held up the flit gun, the handle whacked the back of Fred's monster costume, and the head has flipped down with a solid "clink."

Barney is rocking Fred's head back and forth, finally gives it one last mighty yank. Something breaks. Barney falls back on the passenger side of the car. Fred drives with one hand, "raps" the monster head. It rattles. When Fred speaks again, the monster mouth no longer opens and closes in sync.

A fence surrounds the empty housing development; in the distance, we can see the dark Slate Scrapers, and past them, the brightly-lit and gleaming Fibersphere and Slate Needle. We hear a SCREECH and then the CAMERA PANS BACK to pickup Fred's CAR as it whips around a turn, two wheels off the ground. It crashes right into the gate, knocking down a sign reading "SLATE CITY--DELIVERY GATE." The fence collapses all around the car.

INT. FIBRESPHERE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dust and little fragments of construction material are still tinkling down around our heroes. The elevator cable sways from its uppermost pulley. Slowly, something stirs in the pile of arms, legs and scaly limbs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
First to sit up is Barney, who groans, rubs his head. Next, Fred sits up. Damn! The impact has knocked Fred's monster mask back on his head! Fred mutters angrily... Barney starts to help... and then they both notice that there's another monstrous head in the middle of their group! There're big "takes" all around, and then the xenosaurus leaps out of the tangle of bodies, treads air, and runs away!

Fred "gets up to speed" and chases the xeno. Barney follows.

<DIRECTION>
Fred and Barney both leap on the mysterious xenosaurus -- all crash through a wall --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SLATE NEEDLE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The panicked partygoers turn as a section of wall collapses. Dust and debris billow upwards. The battered monster mask breaks loose from Fred's costume, bounces on the floor. Slowly, everyone gets up: Fred... Barney ... and two halves of the xenosaurus: The bottom half is Piltdown; the top-half is Pyrite.

Suddenly the entire building shudders. Dust falls from the ceiling. Everyone looks at Lava.
</DIRECTION>
<LAVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, all right, I admit it! I got in over my head in the stock market... took some big losses... I had these guys pull jobs for me all over town disguised as a monster... but it still wasn't enough... and when I saw all those coo-coo berries being delivered every day, I guess I just lost my head... I figured with the Woca sap in the Fibremix, the berry juice as superfluous...

EXT. SLATE NEEDLE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rescue VEHICLES and police CARS ROAR up, slam to a halt, CAT SIRENS WAILING. The rescue workers jump out. Firefighters carry circular trampolines of hide stitched to bamboo frames; others go to the back of their trucks and start to turn cranks on the hook and ladder trucks to raise the ladders.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON A HOOK AND LADDER TRUCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's actually a wheeled carriage carrying a firesaurus, which is a critter with a very tiny body and an incred- ibly long neck. The bony plates on the creature's back make perfect stairs.
</DIRECTION>

However, the creature is noticeably listless and uncooperative.

Now, the remaining LIGHT FIXTURES CRASH down. When they hit the floor, the oil lamps inside spills and fire spreads.

<WILMA>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fred! There's a fire hose -- !
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILMA>
<DIRECTION>
Indeed, it's on the back wall in a closed box marked FIRE HOSE--IN CASE OF EMERGENCY BREAK GLASS. Fred and Barney take a step towards it, but the fire quickly spreads and cuts them off. Helpless, they step back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a THUNDEROUS ROAR, the two SLATE SCRAPERS visible through what's left of the picture window COLLAPSE. Then the big statue of Slate just outside the window begins to decompose. It falls in on itself like a sand sculpture in a storm... finally, for a split second it is, well, life-sized, and then the head of the statue snaps loose, CRASHES through the only remaining pane of GLASS here ... rolls up to Slate's feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pause. Everyone looks at everyone else. This is it: Titanic time. Fred embraces Wilma... Barney embraces Betty. Their kids are pulled into the clinch. Even Slate takes Mrs. Slate's hand. Talk about grace under pressure... and speaking of --

<DIRECTION>
GRACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- the star fashion model, suddenly her Fibrethread costume decomposes, leaving her in her cute little animal print undies.

In the middle of going down with the ship, she turns Bam-Bam's face away from this display.

</BARNEY>
<FRED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Y-yeah. Everything's gonna be just -- Whoa, hoo-hah, aggh --
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRED>
<DIRECTION>
He's started yelping because he's realized his arm is on fire, and now he jumps up and the others begin beating at the arm with anything in their hands, and then Fred suddenly pushes away from them, stands there with a small flame flickering on his forearm like a Rock Vegas stage magician.
</DIRECTION>
<FRED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Wait a minute -- I don't feel anything at all --
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRED>
<DIRECTION>
With his other "claw" he slaps tentatively at the flames, and then confidentially snuffs it out.
</DIRECTION>
<BARNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It must be the suit, Fred -- old Bedrock High built them things to last --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARNEY>
<DIRECTION>
Fred looks over at the wall of flame separating the guests from the fire hose. As everyone gets the same idea, Dino rushes up, the costume head in his mouth. All brighten.

Barney helps Fred with the head, twists it into place.

He lowers his head, runs through the fire, which licks at him harmlessly. Then with his claw, he SMASHES the amber GLASS --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE BOX
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A big PYTHONSAURUS is curled up inside, SNORING. (Note to herpetologists: The pythonosaurus is not quite a snake: it has little vestigial forepaws the better to emote with. Right now the snoring head is in those little paws.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Pythonsaurus stirs, looks at Fred, "sniffs" the smoke. Then he raises one hand and finger as if to say "one moment." Then the pythonsaurus turns his head towards a nozzle like the ones in hamster cages, slurps loudly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear gallons and gallons of WATER GURGLING away...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE MAIN ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone retreats from the fire. Slate picks up the head of the statue, his only souvenir.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WITH FRED
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Waiting impatiently until the pythonsaurus finally finishes drinking. It wipes its mouth daintily with a napkin, slaps a little fire helmet on its head, turns and runs back into the other room. (Behind him, yards and yards of pythonsaurus unroll from a hidden compart- ment behind the box.) Water shoots out of the creature's mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Fred turns in a semi-circle and puts out every lick of flame in the room. All the guests cheer, rush forward and slap Fred on the back. Pebbles jumps up on him and kisses him.

Meanwhile, the pythonsaurus gives Fred (or rather his costume) a big look up and down, looks TOWARD the CAMERA.

<PYTHONSAURUS>

<PYTHONSAURUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Heartbreaker!

Depressed, the pythonsaurus follows the others. Fred and Barney cross over into the Fibresphere. As the do, Slate Needle completely collapses.

Their kids on their backs, Fred and Barney exchange a heroic forearm-to-forearm gladiator-type handshake... both put their hands on the cable... and then the whole pulley mechanism falls right down between them and through the hole! A second later, the entire remaining structure collapses!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BELOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone reacts in horror --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ABOVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dust and smoke clear. When we can see again, well, it's not a pretty sight. The entire fibresphere is gone. All that's left, teetering on two spindly supports, are two tiny islands of safety connected by a twisted maze of rubble too small for a human to negotiate... and all that's holding that up is a long guide wire leading to the ground!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER

Figures on one of the islands stir: Fred. Barney. Bam-Bam... Pebbles! The platform shudders again. Barney aims the flit gun -- empty! The dads hold on to the kids. It's all they can do.

MUSIC COMES UP DRAMATICALLY as he catches on! His eyes fill with courage and he charges toward the spindly bridge that leads to his master and friends.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dino dives through the hoops of bamboo, duplicating his steps in "The Dino Dance." He reaches the other island! Without a beat, still keeping time, he puts the two kids on his shoulders, just like in the dance! Then he "presents" his tail to Fred -- Fred hands his tail to Barney -- and then --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LONG SHOT

<DIRECTION>
HIS POV - CORDON OF POLICE OFFICERS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All with weapons aimed right at him. Spotlights on the police car roofs (actually little fires with parabolic mirrors) are operated by uniformed monkeys.

Feldspar is at the head of the group. He cocks his shotgun. The elastic catapults at the hammers twitch menacingly --

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE - FRED
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Momentarily safe, he tries desperately to remove that stupid head -- bangs it against the wall, tears at it with his claws -- -- meanwhile, the chunk of Fibrerock protecting him decomposes! He's back in the line of fire!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DINO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flanked by Wilma, Barney and the kids, who are shouting for the police to stop, only Dino the wonder bronto has the wits to act!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"YI-YI-YI-ING," he races forward, CAMERA FOLLOWING -- and with lightning reflexes grabs the seat of Fred's monster suit and -- de-pants him! Instantly, Dino whirls Fred around, points to the now revealed striped undershorts.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Gee, Sarge, now you don't have to shoot him -- !
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAVEL>
<DIRECTION>
Now Fred confirms Gravel's hunch as the costume head finally pops off. All the cops lower their guns. (Strangely, though, Feldspar still continues to raise his gun -- even aims! Then an alarmed Gravel wrestles it away from his superior.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FLINTSTONES AND RUBBLES - DAWN

Safe, they all emotionally embrace. Fred even suffers Dino's affection. (In the b.g., a police car holding Piltdown, Pyrite and Lava drives past. Poindexter Lava is chasing the car.)

RESCUE DINOS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Several sniff at the air, look curiously at a nearby pile of crumbled Fibrerock. One and then another shuffles over, tentatively tastes some... grins... and digs in! Seeing this, the "firesauruses" crane out their necks, also begin chowing down on the pile of Fibrerock crumbs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FRED, BARNEY, SLATE AND OTHERS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All turn at the growing sound of the ANIMALS PIGGING OUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now DINO "YI-YI-YI'S" past this group and leaps into the pile, munching like crazy.
</DIRECTION>

Barney puts out his hand as chunks of Fibrerock shower down like rain from the feeding frenzy. Catching some pieces, he nibbles on it a little.

Disbelieving, Fred moves over to the happily-munching animals. He has to get on his knees to wiggle in with the pack. He grabs some, stuffs it in his mouth... chews. His eyes widen...

We're back where we began. As "The End" appears on the drive-in screen, cars are streaming out of the drive-in theatre. The Flintstone car is among them.

EXT. DRIVE-IN RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fred and company roll into a '50's-style drive-in restaurant. A sign advertises BRONTO BURGERS AND RIBS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A pretty carhop on stone roller skates glides over. Fred holds up one finger towards her. She nods, scampers O.S. Fred rubs his hands and licks his lips with antici- pation... and then the girl returns with a massive rack of ribs on a car tray. She hooks it on the edge of the driver's door... and the entire car tips over with a crash.

EXT. FLINTSTONE HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDEN FROM the mailbox. Fred and family pull up. Dino runs in first, followed by Wilma with Pebbles already asleep on her shoulder. Fred follows, the saber-tooth cat on his heels. Fred stops in the doorway to put a milk bottle on the doorstep, and then puts the cat down beside it. He shuts the door. Quick as a flash, the cat leaps through the side window. Pause. The door opens and the cat puts Fred out, then slams the door! Fred recovers from his shock, tries the door... it's locked!
