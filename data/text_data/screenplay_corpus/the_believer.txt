INT. YESHIVA CLASSROOM -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A run-down place. A dozen 12-year-old BOYS sit at old- fashioned desks. These are not Hasidim, but Orthodox Jews: normal American kids in yarmulkes. The teacher, RAV ZINGESSER is young, overweight, acnescarred, good-humored.
</DIRECTION>
<RAV_ZINGESSER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And why did the Holy One -- blessed be He -- do this? Why did he ask Abraham to sacrifice his only son, whom he loved?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAV_ZINGESSER>
<DIRECTION>
Two boys off to one side: AVI (a smart, tough, brownnose) and DANNY (the eternal dissident) argue under their breath....

	It was a test of Abraham's faith. Of his devotion to God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</12_YEAR_OLD_STUART>
<12_YEAR_OLD_DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not about Abraham's faith. It's about God's power. God says, "You know how powerful I am? I can make you do anything I want, no matter how stupid. Even kill your own son. Because I'm everything, you're nothing."
	</DIALOGUE>
</12_YEAR_OLD_DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
TITTERS. Danny looks around at his classmates: nerds, wankers, nose-pickers. Two kids in back furtively read the racing form under their desks. He hates them for their indifference as much as he despises Stuart's piety or Avi's ass-kissing.
</DIRECTION>
<RAV_ZINGESSER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But, Danny, if HaShem is everything, and we are nothing how are we to judge His actions?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAV_ZINGESSER>

	We have free will and intelligence -- which God allegedly gave us....

<AVI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyway, God never lets Abraham kill Isaac. He provides the ram so that --

</AVI>
<12_YEAR_OLD_DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Personally, I think that's a lie. I think he did kill him.

<RAV_ZINGESSER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think?! Based on what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAV_ZINGESSER>
<12_YEAR_OLD_DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's midrash supporting this. My father read a book by Shalom Spiegel that -- Isaac actually died and was reborn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</12_YEAR_OLD_DANNY>
<RAV_ZINGESSER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No one follows that midrash.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAV_ZINGESSER>
<12_YEAR_OLD_DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do; I follow it. But okay, say God provided the ram. So what? Once Abraham raised the knife, in his heart it was as if he'd killed him. He could never forget that. And neither could Isaac. Look at him: he's traumatized, he's a putz for the rest of his life. By the end he can't tell Jacob from Esau....

The class sits frozen in terror, waiting for God to kill Danny. But nothing happens.

<DIRECTION>
INT. YESHIVA STAIRWELL -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny runs down the steps alone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RUN-DOWN COMMERCIAL AREA -- TWILIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny walking home alone. He sees TWO KIDS (older, tougher, blonder) coming toward him. He slips off his yarmulke and slants across the street. The kids slant that way. He hears a RUMBLING, looks up at an ELEVATED TRAIN entering a station. He runs up the steps toward the SHRIEKING train....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. 7 TRAIN -- 1998 -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TITLE: 13 YEARS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The train passes above used car lots, discount furniture stores, residential side streets...finally pulls into a station. The doors open. People file on, the CAMERA letting them go by until it spots a tall, thin COLLEGE STUDENT in a YARMULKE. Danny grown up?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAN with him as he sits, opens an organic chemistry text. The doors close. The train starts up, but the Jewish boy hardly notices; he is already reading. He sways with the motion of the car, half-hidden by other passengers. We realize he is being watched.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE ANGLE: another YOUNG MAN, standing -- a "SUEDE-HEAD" (his hair cut so short it's like a fine fabric).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUEDE-HEAD'S POV: THE JEWISH BOY pushes his glasses back up his nose, wipes the nose with a handkerchief, puts the handkerchief away, and all the time his eyes have not left the page. Suede-head steps between passengers and stands directly over the Jewish boy. He looks down at the yarmulke pinned to the stiff, wavy hair, at the oversized shirt collar, scrawny neck, prominent Adam's apple, pimples, dandruff, ingrown facial hair...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He steps closer, crowding the boy's knees. The boy shifts a little without looking up. Subtly but relentlessly, Suede- head pursues him along the bench until, unable to slide farther, the boy flattens his legs against the seat. Suede- head presses into the boy's knees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boy accidentally bumps a BUSINESSMAN to Suede-head's left. The man (late 30s, Wall Street Journal, African- American) looks from the boy to Suede-head and understands at once what is going on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suede-head stares right back -- and the BUSINESSMAN returns to his paper. Suede-head eases him aside and steps on the boy's shoe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOES -- A HEAVY BLACK BOOT PINS A BROWN WINGTIP TO THE FLOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wingtip wiggles back and forth, finally working free. The boy still hasn't looked up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUEDE-HEAD & THE JEWISH BOY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
swaying, locked in a strange, silent intimacy. Suede-head forces the boy into ever more contorted postures, increasingly ridiculous denials of what is happening. And the boy not only never stops reading the chemistry text, he keeps highlighting relevant passages.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The train slows. The boy closes the book, caps the highlighter, gathers his things and manages to stand up, wriggling awkwardly around Suede-head. The doors open, he gets off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STATION -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looking up a long escalator, the Jewish boy riding down toward us.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suede-head arrives on the run at the top, races down a flight of stairs, vaults the bannister, slides down a metal slope....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lands on his feet and comes to stand at the foot of the escalator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boy rides inexorably down. At the bottom, he tries to go around Suede-head who blocks this way, then another, driving him into a corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boy realizes he has nowhere to go -- finally turns to face his tormentor. Their eyes meet for the first time. He is actually bigger than Suede-head, but not nearly as strong. He won't fight, is simply acknowledging what he can no longer deny. There is even an odd relief that disgusts Suede-head more than all the rest.
</DIRECTION>
<SUEDE_HEAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fucking kike.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUEDE_HEAD>
<DIRECTION>
He slaps him in the face. He stumbles backward. As Suede- head goes to hit him again, the boy holds his books in front of him. Suede-head punches the books straight into his face. The boy falls, curls into a fetal position. Suede-head kicks him....
</DIRECTION>
<SUEDE_HEAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get up.... Get the fuck up....
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUEDE_HEAD>
<DIRECTION>
He won't budge. Suede-head punches him repeatedly until he hears VOICES approaching. He runs back up the stairs to the train and only as we FOLLOW him do we realize that he is our protagonist. This is Danny grown up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:

INT. DANNY'S STUDIO APARTMENT -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Like his brain, the room is at once crowded and tidy and has, so far as we can see, neither windows nor doors. Shelves of books, CDs, magazines, videotapes loom over a neatly made bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny, in briefs and boots, is lifting weights. The phone rings. A machine picks up: no outgoing message, only a BEEP. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this working? I'm trying to reach Danny Balint...Danny, it's Vicki, we met at Happy Jack's last month...?

He keeps doing curls.

	I was hoping maybe we could...get together again... Give me a call -- 718-555-0193.

She hangs up. A moment later Danny finishes the set, gasping for air, heart pounding, muscles throbbing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SAME -- NIGHT

A radio is playing the news. Danny sits at a small desk, on the phone and browsing the Internet, a take-out menu beside him.

Men drink in clusters, including a group of skinheads.... Danny takes a place alone at the bar, drawing furtive attention from the regulars. When the BARTENDER finally comes over...
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vodka tonic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
A strange call for this place. As he waits, Danny turns and watches the skinheads enough to make them aware of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The girls watch him, too. The skins don't like that. One of them (Billings) seems ready to do something about it. The others try to calm him, and when they look back, Danny has left. He barely touched the drink.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The skins are puzzled, but one indicates his watch: time to go. They gather their stuff....

EXT. STREET -- NIGHT

The three skins -- O.L., CARLETON, BILLINGS -- walk up an East Side street. Billings is telling a story....

Grand but threadbare. The skins enter: O.L. like a child, Carleton like a sardonic adolescent, Billings like a revolutionary, Danny like an uncrowned prince.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CURTIS ZAMPF is addressing a dozen or so guests. He is 40 but appears younger; with rough good looks, longish hair and a leather jacket, he seems more like an aging rock star or sexy novelist that a standard-issue American Nazi.

</DIRECTION>
<CURTIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...The day he graduated high school, he'd go see his uncle down at the gas works, or the priest's brother in the shipyard, get his apprentice papers, eight years later he'd be making $16.50 an hour, have four kids, play ball on Sundays in Columbus Park, and when he died, the whole town'd get drunk and cry over him....
	</DIALOGUE>

The crowd -- nonunion electricians, white taxi drivers, unemployed bookkeepers, failed academics, off-duty cops -- listens quietly.

During this, a young woman (CARLA) appears from the rear of the apartment, heading for the kitchen with a coffee cup and a history book. She glances into the living room.
</DIRECTION>
<CURTIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Today, when that kid walks down the street it's full of trash and half the faces are black. The shipyard's closed, all the jobs at the gas works are set-asides, and by the time he drops out of school, he can barely get a job at Burger King. So he drinks, smokes crack, and when he hangs himself on the front porch at twenty-three, the only people at his wake are a couple of buddies and his mother. The boy's father won't find out he's dead till six months later.

	At first, no one will know why the victims are being killed.

</DANNY>
<CURTIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wouldn't announce it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CURTIS>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd say nothing. After two or three, people will try to find a pattern. A reason.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<CURTIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But when it comes out, the public will be outraged. It will look like Germany all over again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CURTIS>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Isn't that what we want? Germany all over again? Only done right this time...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd feels a deep atavistic thrill. Zampf glances at Mrs. Moebius....
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Without speeches or political parties. A movement without leaders so that no one can stop it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
The room is stunned to silence. Mrs. Moebius signals Curtis.
</DIRECTION>
<CURTIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, let's break this up for now....

<MRS_MOEBIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you see how they reacted to him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MOEBIUS>
<CURTIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, of course. But that only plays in this room, with people who aren't embarrassed to call themselves Nazis. If you want a modern fascism, you don't mention Jews.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CURTIS>
<MRS_MOEBIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a romantic movement, Curtis. It always has been.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MOEBIUS>
<CURTIS>

	Lina, the Thousand-Year Reich barely lasted a decade.... Do you really want to go down that road again? In America of all places, where obedience and discipline are not exactly the national virtues...

She looks over at Danny, now chatting with Carla....

</DANNY>
<LINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Young man...

He turns. She's beckoning to him. He gives Carla a look, then crosses to her, sitting in a chair she indicates. Curtis offers him a drink; he declines. Carla takes one.

	Lina Moebius. And you are...?

	I was going to ask you the same thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
Smiles, laughter. Everyone seems to relax.
</DIRECTION>
<LINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what are you really after, Daniel?... Do you just want to kill Jews, or do you have something larger in mind?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINA>
<DIRECTION>
Carla watches, silent. Danny is aware of both mother and daughter.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Without blood -- a willingness to spill it -- there's no real power, no authority.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<LINA>
<DIRECTION>
(pleased by this)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Curtis is afraid you'll marginalize us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINA>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're already marginal. We are saying what no one else has the guts to say. Isn't that precisely our appeal?

</DANNY>
<LINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what Jew would you kill first?

	An investment banking house.

	<DIALOGUE>
	He's Jewish? Manzetti?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MOEBIUS>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Totally. The family emigrated from Bulgaria when he was eleven.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<CURTIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How would you kill him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CURTIS>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd have to research it, study his routines, his security.... But ideally on a New York street at midday, using a small-caliber automatic without a silencer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why no silencer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want it to be an event.

</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
Lina stands, takes a sherry. Everyone else rises with her.
</DIRECTION>
<LINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Danny, why don't you come visit us in the country. We have young men with lots of energy and no ideas. Maybe you could give them something to think about.... Bring your friends, if you like....
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINA>
<DIRECTION>
As Curtis leads him toward the door, Danny looks around for Carla, hears WOMEN'S VOICES arguing in German. Frustrated, he goes down the stairs....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny and the other skins walking down the middle of the street, drinking beer, oblivious to traffic.
</DIRECTION>
<BILLINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bring your friends.... We're not his friends.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLINGS>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>

<BLACK_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, bonehead...get your moon ass off the street.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACK_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Billings turns and throws his beer at the voice. A CRASH, BREAKING GLASS, a screech of BRAKES, CAR DOORS open and shut...
</DIRECTION>
<BILLINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you go back to Rwanda and give each other AIDS.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLINGS>
<DIRECTION>
That does it. The skins run out of frame. SOUNDS of a fight. Danny watches, indifferent, then finally joins in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PRECINCT LOCKUP -- NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
The skins in a cell. O.L., head bloody, moaning and vomiting.
</DIRECTION>
<O_L>

Carleton comforts him. Billings paces, looks at Danny, sitting against the wall, relaxed for the first time.
</DIRECTION>
<BILLINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What, do you like it here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLINGS>
<DANNY>

Danny looks up: a JAILER unlocks the cell. Carla appears behind him. Danny stops without stepping through the open door.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not leaving without them.

</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
The other skins are surprised, moved. Carla and Danny stare at each other. Finally she turns to the jailer....

A Mercedes pulls up, Carla driving. The skins climb out, Carleton guiding O.L., who cannot see.

	He should go to a hospital.

Billings nods grudgingly. The car drives off. Carleton grins.

Carla leads Danny through the darkened apartment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CARLA'S ROOM -- TWILIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An old bookcase full of leather-bound German volumes...Danny opens one marked Hofmannsthal. He tries to read a marked passage.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"...und die Worte zerfielen mir im Munde wie modrige Pilze..."
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"And the words fell apart in my mouth like moldering mushrooms..."

</CARLA>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How come so many of the books are in Spanish?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're my father's. He's from Argentina. My mother's family went there during the war. That's where they met.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are they still together?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<CARLA>

	He's in a mental institution.... He's been there for ten years, off and on. Mostly on.

</CARLA>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is he a Nazi?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess. His parents are. He doesn't care about that.

</CARLA>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's he care about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Killing himself.

</CARLA>
<DIRECTION>
They look at each other. There's that gulf between them that they have to cross, but they're not sure how.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think people ever commit suicide out of happiness?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's stupid. Why would they?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>

He shrugs. She takes his hand, rubs the bruised knuckles.
</DIRECTION>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not like the others, are you?... Your friends.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I am. Basically I am.

</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
She leans close, whispers....
</DIRECTION>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hurt me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<DIRECTION>
He's surprised, but not very. He grabs her wrist, twists it.
</DIRECTION>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ow! That's too hard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls her out of frame. She starts to say something, but it's cut off by another CRY OF PAIN. We keep looking out the window....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SAME -- LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The light has shifted across the city, and we hear only a muffled sobbing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA TURNS to look at...Carla and Danny naked on the bed. He lies back, reading the German book. She's curled on her side, weeping abjectly. Still sobbing, she rolls over, buries her face in his chest. We see that his neck is scratched up.
</DIRECTION>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do it again....
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<DIRECTION>
She begins to fondle him. He ignores it until he finishes the poem, then turns to her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SAME -- LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The light has shifted again. Danny sleeps alone, his face strangely innocent. Carla drops onto the bed, shakes him.
</DIRECTION>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get up...you gotta go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<DIRECTION>
He opens his eyes. She's dressed, her hair wet from the shower, a faint puffiness around her mouth. He pulls her down to him.
</DIRECTION>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you have to leave. I've got to write a paper.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(slaps his stomach hard)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Out!

</CARLA>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up. Her face is cold, indifferent. He gets to his feet.

INT. MOEBIUS APARTMENT -- DAY

Danny on his way to the door, hears something, turns...CURTIS ZAMPF is coming out of a bedroom in his underwear. From within...

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bring the paper, too.

Curtis now sees Danny. A look between them. Danny goes out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. QUEENS, STAIRS TO ELEVATED TRAIN -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Once a Jewish neighborhood, now occupied chiefly by blacks, Latins and more recent immigrants.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Danny (wearing headphones) comes down the steps... TWO BLACK KIDS (big, menacing, boombox) are coming up, blocking his way. Danny walks right between them, forcing them apart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They turn, glare after him. He turns, glares back. They scoff and keep going up. He walks on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OZONE PARK HOUSE -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He lets himself into a row house. We barely notice the mezzuzah on the door post.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OZONE PARK HOUSE -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A nearly vanished world of lower-middle-class Jewish life, though the "Jewishness" (menorah, kiddush cup...) is restricted to one dusty corner behind a secular chaos of books, newspapers, half-empty cups, half-filled glasses...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny's FATHER, 55, sits on a faded chair, an oxygen mask on a cart beside him. Danny's sister, LINDA, 30, is cutting his hair with a scissors. When Danny enters, they both look up at him in surprise, alarm, possibly even love. For a moment no one knows what to do.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The father begins to wheeze, puts the mask over his face and breathes deeply. Linda tells him to lean back; resumes cutting. On the wall we see Danny's BAR MITZVAH PHOTO.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile, Danny has found a stack of mail, all addressed to him. His father and sister are visible behind him in a mirror. Without speaking, he goes down the hall, and we hear him DESCEND STAIRS to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOUSE, BASEMENT -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny has taken off his coat (revealing a black T-shirt with a red swastika), and is going through a number of cardboard boxes marked "D," pulling out comic books, baseball gloves, martial arts gear, drawings of voluptuous women, morbid gothic figures, gun magazines, books about Hitler, Nazis...and finally a .22 AUTOMATIC stuffed in a blue sock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOUSE, BASEMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He removes the clip, checks the slide, while nodding to the MUSIC coming through his earphones. He looks up, sees LINDA at the foot of the stairs, pulls off the headset.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I knocked, you didn't answer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA>
<DIRECTION>
It's too late to conceal the gun; he places it beside him. She does her best to ignore the swastika shirt....
</DIRECTION>
<LINDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just came to get some stuff. I'll be out in five minutes.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He doesn't want me around.

</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
She looks down as if that were not true, or the way in which it is too complicated to go into.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's going to die.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as Danny looks away)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He won't take his medicine. He eats dairy. He probably still smokes when I'm not around.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off Danny's helpless gesture)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I asked him to come live with us. Alex offered to share his room, unsolicited.... But he didn't want to be any trouble.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then he couldn't be bitter about living alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<LINDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why deprive him of his greatest pleasure?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA>
<DIRECTION>
They exchange what are almost smiles. But then the subject she's been trying to avoid -- the only subject -- suddenly erupts...
</DIRECTION>
<LINDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, Jesus Christ, Danny, how can you wear that thing?... You know what it means? To your people...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're not my people....

	Tell it to Hitler.

<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, he decides? Hitler's the chief rabbi now?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<LINDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this because of those kids who used to beat you up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What kids?...

</DANNY>
<LINDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Polacks? From Sacred Heart?

<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nobody ever beat me up.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as she sighs, turns to go)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Linda, there're fifty reasons. Even if you knew them all, there'd be another fifty you didn't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<LINDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know them?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

INT. LIVING ROOM, QUEENS HOUSE -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny (now wearing a plain white T-shirt) bends over the coffee table eating a noodle casserole and reading the Post. His father eats off a TV table. He finishes, cursorily wipes his mouth, picks up a remote and turns on the television.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Do I give a shit?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER>
<DIRECTION>
Danny holds up both hands: he's not arguing, simply informing.
</DIRECTION>
<FATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Torah says not to light a fire on the Sabbath, because it's work, correct?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Danny sighs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But if alternating current's running through the wires every second of every day, and I throw a switch, send it here instead of there, how is that lighting a fire?

</FATHER>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Do chickens give milk?"

</DANNY>
<FATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exactly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER>
<DIRECTION>
He channel-surfs until he comes to a stand-up COMIC doing a routine. They both watch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TV: the COMIC is funny in a brutal, compulsive way. Lots of pop references, implicit postmodern nihilism. The routine reflects what Danny (and the Shiites, the Unabomber, Timothy McVeigh, T.S. Eliot, et al.) have against the modern world.
</DIRECTION>
<FATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's this?

	After your mother died, that's when you stopped going to shul. Doing your homework. Everything.

</FATHER>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that's when the Mets started to stink.

</DANNY>
<FATHER>

</FATHER>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>

The father snorts. On TV the comic gets off a line, and they both laugh. Their laughs are quite similar; they glance at each other.

<FATHER>

Danny goes into the kitchen. The father extracts a pack of Salems from between the cushions, lights one, takes a desperate drag... The phone RINGS. He curses, stubs it out, grabs the phone.

	Yeah?... Hold on.... It's for you.

Danny gives his father a dish of ice cream, takes the phone.

	Hello...?

<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Daniel Balint? My name's Guy Danielsen. I'm a reporter with the New York Times.

</VOICE>
<DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
(impressed, suspicious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	New York Times...?

</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
His father looks up. Danny takes the phone into the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm doing a piece on right-wing groups, post Oklahoma City. I hear you're an important figure in those circles. You have a lot of interesting ideas....

EXT. COFFEE SHOP, QUEENS -- DAY

INT. COFFEE SHOP, QUEENS -- DAY

<DIRECTION>
Danny enters, looks around. To his surprise he sees GUY DANIELSEN from the Nazi meeting rising, extending his hand.

Guy shrugs, smiles apologetically.

ANOTHER ANGLE -- DANNY & GUY WITH COFFEE

<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Milk...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
As Danny declines, Guy gets out a small cassette recorder, is about to turn it on, when he notices Danny's reaction....
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it okay if I record this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No... Yeah, fine, go ahead... So what's this about? Is this about me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm trying to figure out where the radical right is going to next....I thought you were the most interesting person at that meeting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about Curtis Zampf?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Curtis is a politician -- and a bit of a hustler. He's not a thinker.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I agree.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The other night you said the modern world is a Jewish disease. Could you elaborate on that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In the movement -- the racialist movement -- we believe there's a hierarchy of the races. Not just in IQ, but in the civilization, the art, the forms of government, the civilizations that each race produces... Why are you writing this down if you're recording it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It helps me concentrate.... So does that mean you're a white supremacist?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What should I be, a white inferior- ist? A multicultural Zulu egalitarian? Let me ask, where are your people from?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My mother's family is French, my father's was German, originally.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	German. Mine, too. So who do you think's given more to the world, the Germans -- Beethoven, Goethe, Nietzsche -- or the entire continent of Africa? Ibos, Bantus, Mandingos...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Danny, what about the Jews?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
Danny shifts in his seat, growing more interested....
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Jews are different.... Blacks are disgusting and inferior, but it's like criticizing a retarded child. The Jews are...a poison in the human well....
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A poison...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me give you an example.... Sexuality.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sexuality??? What do you mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You ever fuck a Jewish girl?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What??!?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you ever fuck one, Guy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<GUY>
<DIRECTION>
(laughing, embarrassed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that go to do with...I've gone out with a, with Jewish women. Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And? WHat did you notice?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Notice? Like what...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jewish girls like to give head, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. Is that right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And Jewish men like to get it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everybody likes to, don't they?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. It's very pleasurable. But the Jews are obsessed with it. You know why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because the Jew is essentially female.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Female...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Real men -- white, Christian men -- we fuck a woman. We make her come with our cocks. But the Jew doesn't like to penetrate and thrust -- he can't assert himself that directly -- so he resorts to perversions. Oral sex is technically a perversion, you know that, don't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as Guy nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	After a woman has been with a Jewish man, she never wants a normal partner again. A normal man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does that mean the Jew is the better lover?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not listening. He isn't better. He gives pleasure, but that's actually a weakness.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Danny, what makes you think you know all this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's just say I've done due diligence.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, fine, it's not that the Jew, the Jews own the media and the banks. It's that they're sexually corrupt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Jews clearly control the media and the banks. Investment banks, not the commercial ones. But the point is they carry out in those realms the same principles they display in sexuality. They undermine traditional life; they deracinate society.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
Danny leans over to make sure Guy's getting it right.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Deracinate... Tear out the roots. A people -- a real people -- derives its genius from the land: the sun, the sea, the soil. This is how they know themselves. But the Jew doesn't have soil.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He has Israel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those aren't Jews.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course they're Jews.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Notice the Israelis: a fundamentally secular society. They no longer need Judaism because they have soil. The real Jew is a wanderer, a nomad. He has no roots, no attachments. So he "universalizes" everything. He can't hammer a nail, plow a field. He can only buy and sell, invest capital, manipulate markets. He takes the life of a people rooted in soil and turns it into a cosmopolitan culture based on books, ideas, numbers. This is his strength....
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pumped; this is what he loves)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take the great Jewish minds: Marx, Freud, Einstein. What have they given us: communism, infantile sexuality and the atom bomb. In a mere three centuries since these guys emerged from the ghettos of Europe, they've taken us from a world built on order and reason and hurled us into a chaos of class warfare, irrational urges and relativity, a world where the very existence of matter and meaning is in doubt. Why? Because it is the deepest impulse of the Jewish soul to unravel the very fabric of life until nothing is left but thread, nothing but nothingness. Nothingness without end...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are all Jews the same?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Differences exist, of course, but they're irrelevant. For the Jew, his Jewishness dominates everything. Even the ones who renounce it, who hate it, who want to cut it out of their hearts a knife...can't escape. They're still just Jews.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
Guy finishes writing that and looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Danny, this is great. You're incredibly articulate. One more thing... How can you believe this when you're a Jew yourself?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. Danny smiles at the mistake....
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? Excuse me?...
	</DIALOGUE>

(Guy says nothing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're kidding, right?

</DANNY>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know Rabbi Stanley Nadelman? He used to be at Congregation Beth Elohim in Ozone Park...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who? How would I know him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He says you were bar mitzvahed there, in March 1988.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You believe that? And you call yourself a reporter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you're saying it's not true.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at me. DO I look Jewish? Look...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
He indicates his hair, turns sideways to show his profile?
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Were you ever bar mitzvahed anywhere else?

<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know who you're fucking with here?

(sputtering, unsure what to say)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen to me....

</DANNY>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why would Nadelman lie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To discredit me. Because I know who they are. Look, I thought I explained it to you. Those people can say or do anything. And they will. It's all narrative to them, it's... Are you going to print what this guy said?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give me a reason not to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's slander. It's reckless disregard. I'll sue you and your fucking Jew paper.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does that mean you deny what he says is true? Yes or no.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
GUN: pulled from Danny's pants, slammed down on the table... Guy sits back abruptly. Danny picks it up, cocks it....

<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at me. Look at me, Guy.... Oh, now you can't look at me? Look at me, you schmuck. Look at me....

EXT. REAR OF MOTEL -- TWILIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny and Billings see PEOPLE in back. Now NINE YOUNG MEN and a bulldog come to greet them: survivalists, speed-freaks, skinheads...and one blank loner (DRAKE) with a blue swastika tattooed to his lips like a tiny kiss. A case of STEROID EXCESS fixes his gaze on Danny.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're from New York. Curtis Zampf invited us.

</DANNY>
<WHIT>

Are they in the wrong place? Then someone laughs, they all relax, exchange greetings, obscure handshakes. Everyone's just getting comfortable when, for no apparent reason...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STEROID EXCESS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
slugs Danny in the face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stumbles backward. The others crowd around, keep him from falling, also from getting away. Billings starts to help, but people grab him: this is Danny's problem.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Steroid comes at him.... Danny steps inside the charge and goes to work on the bigger man's body. We barely see what happens, but we hear it and feel the crowd's shock. Danny is stronger than we realized and much more vicious. In seconds, Steroid sinks to his knees, face bloody. Danny holds up him, leans close:
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Enough?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
Steroid mumbles in the affirmative. Danny nods -- then hits him four more shots to the face. Even this crowd winces. Steroid drops with a wet thud.
</DIRECTION>

As Danny straightens up, wiping the blood off his hands, people instinctively step back.

DRAKE

Sets up beside them, begins squeezing off rounds so fast, it sounds like an automatic weapon.

TARGETS: the bullets chew up and knock over all four Jews. And selectively: shooting the man's face, the woman's breasts, the boy and girl in the groin. The dog he merely flattens.

Drake looks at Danny without expression, drops the clip, shoves in a fresh one and riddles the black family in similar fashion.

INT. MOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

Nazis sprawled about, drinking beer, impassively watching TV. The bulldog pants on the floor. Carleton calls to it:

EXT. TOWN -- DAY

Danny, Billings, O.L., and Drake walk through the town, looking for trouble. A couple of local TEENAGERS watch them, impressed by the swastikas, tattoos, swagger.

INT. DELICATESSEN -- DAY

Two WAITERS (Jewish college students, athletic, confident) watch the Nazis come in. One indicates to the other that he'll handle this. He brings menus, water; he's carefully polite.

The Nazis, accompanied by a "HATE COUNSELOR" (male) sit in plastic chairs opposite five elderly JEWS. The speaker is in her late 60s, still something of a beauty.

The Nazis laugh. The Jews try to calm the woman, though she has spoken without any evident emotion. Billings gets up restless.

INT. SAME -- LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nazis are dozing, staring out the window. O.L. threads a piece of dental floss through the zipper pull on his trousers. Danny is visibly disgusted by the whole business. Over this we hear:
</DIRECTION>
<POLISH_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...The man was afraid to let us hide on his farm any longer, but he agreed to take us to a more remote place.

<DIRECTION>
THE MAN: mid-70s, tall, stooped, a crushed spirit.
</DIRECTION>
<POLISH_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...simply to assure him I was there. But the sergeant became enraged.... He stuck his bayonet in my son's chest, and lifted him up, impaled on it. My son was three years old....
	</DIALOGUE>
</POLISH_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Billings is muttering, "What a load of crap..." The Hate Counselor looks over sharply. The other Nazis are stunned by the story. Danny can barely contain himself, though we are not sure why.
</DIRECTION>
<POLISH_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...He held him up so that the blood spurting out of him feel on my face.... The soldiers were laughing.

FLASHCUT: EXT. A COUNTRY ROAD -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A horse hitched to a hay wagon; FARMER driving. THREE NAZI SOLDIERS have discovered a Jewish family hiding in the hay. A sergeant is holding up something unseen on the end of his rifle.

The Polish man who has been telling the story looks up at whatever it is. Blood falls on him. The Nazis are laughing.

The counselor is briefly confused....

The Jews are shouting about historical records, the disappearance of families, whole towns.... But Danny is louder:

</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
Some surprise that a Nazi is arguing against a denier.
</DIRECTION>
<ANCIENT_JEW>

	Hitler was not a putz. Hitler was real. God created him to punish the Jews for abandoning God.

<ANCIENT>

Her use of Danny's name feels knowing, slyly invasive. All SOUND VANISHES for a beat, and Danny barely manages to say:

Danny is parked opposite a fortresslike building of soiled brick. For a long time he cannot bring himself to get out. Finally he opens the door....

<DIRECTION>
INT. AHAVAT TORAH, FOYER -- EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LARGE WOMAN, about 40, her body barely contained by a brilliant magenta dress, greets him with a smile the size of a wedding cake. She holds out a prayer book stuffed with flyers.
</DIRECTION>
<LARGE_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shabbat shalom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARGE_WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
She speaks quietly, not wanting to disturb the service, yet even so her voice is huge, and her flashing eyes clearly expect some kind of enthusiastic response. Within we hear the ALENU being chanted.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny ignores her and the proffered siddur. A basket of yarmulkes seems to infuriate him, but he snatches one anyway and, conveying a helpless disgust, puts it on his head. From within he hears...
</DIRECTION>
<CONGREGATION>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) (in rough unison) Ba-yom, ha-hoo, ba-yom, ha hoo...(etc.)

She's startled but not intimidated, is about to respond, when Danny simply turns and walks out of the building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. AHAVAT TORAH -- EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stops beneath an open window through which he hears...

The body of the congregation joins in on certain phrases, producing a subtle and solemn music. Danny chants the entire prayer, and the moment it ends, and the rabbi begins the benediction....

</DIRECTION>
<LARGE_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	YOU EAT SHIT.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARGE_WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Danny realizes he's still wearing the kippah. He throws it at her, but it only goes a couple of feet. He catches it, throws harder. This time it floats back toward him, and he has to jump out the way to keep it from hitting him. He gets in the car and drives off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A WRISTWATCH: 12:05. We are:

EXT. FARMHOUSE -- NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Danny hoists himself onto the kitchen roof. Above him is an open window, candlelight flickering. He starts into the room, stops....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEDROOM -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carla sits on the bed, straddling Curtis, who lies beneath her. She is looking right at Danny. Curtis, unaware of him, keeps thrusting into her from below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny starts to leave, but on second thought stays. Carla stares expressionless, yet more attentive to him than to Curtis. Indeed, their eyes never leave each other, so that when she becomes aroused, we understand that it is Danny she is responding to, Danny she is really making love to.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gradually her face loses its aloofness and seems to reach out to him, to reveal feelings that she can no longer deny. She holds her gaze until, at the final instant, she shudders out a series of stifled cries.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When she looks again, the window is empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DANNY'S MOTEL ROOM -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny reading. A KNOCK at the door. He looks up, Curtis comes in. Danny stiffens at the sight of him, but Curtis is friendly.
</DIRECTION>
<CURTIS>

Danny tilts the book to show him: History of Political Philosophy.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop it!... Where's the light?

</CHAOS_OF_VOICES>
<DIRECTION>
One appears, illuminating nothing, dissipating into the still vaster darkness. A SERIES OF LIGHTS bang on in ecclesiastical bursts, illuminating: a vaulted ceiling... stained glass panels... We are:

INT. SYNAGOGUE SANCTUARY -- NIGHT

A dour, ornate place built in the early decades of the century. The sight of it silences everyone for a moment. Then...

	Jew World...!!

</CARLETON>
<DIRECTION>
Drake, Billings, Carleton, O.L. and Steroid run wild... kicking over benches...spray-painting swastikas...hurling prayer books...urinating from the balcony...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...Danny looks around like someone revisiting his childhood home: slides his hand along a pew back...leafs through a chumash...gazes up at the eternal lamp behind its red glass...the gilded doors of the ark... A hint of Kol Nidre MUSIC haunts him....
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>

Danny turns; Kyle is right behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing. Where is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as Kyle hoists a sports bag)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, let's take one of these panels off so we can get under the bema...the stage.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
As they unscrew a panel, Carleton runs past. A football flashes overhead. We hear GLASS BREAK...LAUGHTER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UNDER THE STAGE -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DANNY WATCHES KYLE attach a bomb (four sticks of dynamite wired to a digital timer) to a 2x4 with a bungee cord. He hooks the ends, cautiously lets go. The cord springs free. The bomb falls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kyle gasps. Danny catches it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frozen, they look at each other. Kyle exhales, takes the bomb and, with Danny holding it, carefully restrings the bungee. A MECHANICAL NOISE overhead:
</DIRECTION>
<STEROID>

Kyle has no idea and doesn't care. Danny scrambles out.

<DIRECTION>
INT. SANCTUARY -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Straightening up, Danny is stunned by a vision:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE OPEN ARK -- THE TORAHS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...their silver crowns and breastplates, velvet robes. And Steroid Excess, lifting one out. Danny reacts with an instinctive horror.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing? Put that down! ...Put it back in there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
Steroid -- cowed by Danny -- starts to obey, but before he can...

<BILLINGS>

<BILLINGS>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's look at the fucking thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLINGS>
<DIRECTION>
Each CURSE makes Danny wince, but he just hovers about nervously as Billings and Steroid try to unwrap the Torah while others gather, some comically wrapping themselves in tallises.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put it there, on the...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
He indicates the bema, stepping back as if to deny any involvement, yet at the same time trying to monitor everything they do.
</DIRECTION>

(indicating crowns, the yod...)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just be careful with the...

Danny cannot endure this desecration, but everyone else laughs, so he keeps his mouth shut.

</KYLE>
<DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
(impulsively taking over)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
He shoves his way in and, gripping the handles, unrolls the Torah. Low MURMURS at the sight of the broad columns, the mysterious calligraphy, the CRACKLING parchment. Danny himself is struck by the sudden immediacy of the sacred text. OVER this...
</DIRECTION>
<VOICES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oooo... Weird... You read it from right to left.... The letters look like squashed bugs.... What kind of paper is that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICES>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not paper, it's parchment. It's made from sheepskin. And all the letters are drawn by hand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Neat calligraphy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYLE>
<DIRECTION>
Danny nods, then, as if against his will....
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's called the flame alphabet. It's supposed to be the word of God written in fire.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<BILLINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fire...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLINGS>
<DANNY>

	The mystics tried to read the white spaces around the letters. They thought there was a whole alternative language hidden there, with secret, alternative meanings.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Cool.

Danny sees Drake watching him, smirks to express his disgust.

<BILLINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck you. I hate the Jews at least as much as you do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLINGS>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you don't.... If you hated them, you'd study them, so you'd know why you hate them. You know what tefillin is? Tsitsis? Shotness? You know the kaddish from the kiddush?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(obviously not)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eichmann? He went to Israel. He studied the Torah, the Talmud, the Mishnah, the whole bit. He hated Jews.

	Who's Eichmann?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLETON>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's Eichmann?!!?

</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
Danny's incredulous, though it's not clear how many of the others know why Eichmann was.
</DIRECTION>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was head of the Gestapo's Jewish sector. He deported people to the camps.

Billings bristles at Danny's authority; Carleton says to him...
</DIRECTION>
<CARLETON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't you see Raiders of the Lost Ark?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLETON>
<BILLINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What??
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLINGS>
<CARLETON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was an ark, man. That was a Torah. They fucked around with it, and the Torah melted their faces.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLETON>
<BILLINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a movie, you moron.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLINGS>
<CARLETON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine, go ahead. Touch the letters.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLETON>
<DIRECTION>
The others are gathered around, delicately touching the sheepskin.
</DIRECTION>
<BILLINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me see.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLINGS>
<DIRECTION>
He pushes through, looks at the Torah. He runs his fingers over the crinkled parchment, the smooth black letters.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said not on the --
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Billings grabs the parchment in both hands and tries to tear it. It's tougher than it looks.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop it! What are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
He tries to stop him, but -- accidentally or not -- Drake gets in the way, and before Danny can do anything else, Billings crumples it and finally tears a long gash into the scroll.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This produces a strange effect on the others. Some (Kyle, Steroid, Drake) join in. They knock the aitz off the bema, it rolls out, exposing ten feet of Torah. They stamp on it, spit on it.... Others (Carleton, O.L.), though less troubled than Danny, are surprised (and embarrassed) by their own revulsion at these acts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny watches helplessly, like the survivor who did nothing as his son was murdered.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally the Torah lies torn and soiled on the stage. A strange silence.
</DIRECTION>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's get out of here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYLE>
<DIRECTION>
...Danny kneels by the Torah. With a tallis, he attempts to clean the parchment. Carleton and O.L. help him roll it onto the aitz. [Echo "Christ taken down from cross" with Torah as Christ.] They replace the cover, the yod, the crowns....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally Danny lifts it up, holds it to him as if it were his dead child. He closes his eyes, murmurs to himself....
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shema yisrael adonai elohenu adonai echod.

</CARLETON>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing. Let's go....
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to walk out, carrying the Torah.
</DIRECTION>
<CARLETON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are you taking that?

INT. DANNY'S MOTEL ROOM -- LATER

<DIRECTION>
Alone he sits at the desk, finds himself gazing at the Torah, standing in a corner of his closet, draped in the tallis.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He slams the closet door, it bounces open. Slams it again, making sure it latches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sits down, looks at the closed door until, in bitter resignation he gets up and opens it again.

He unrolls the Torah on the bed...Scotch tapes the tear closed...attempts to clean the stain with a moistened cloth.

INT. DANNY'S MOTEL ROOM -- DAY

Danny is in the bathroom in front of the mirror, holding his shirt up with his chin as he wraps the tallis around his torso. When he lowers the shirt, the fringes hang out like the tsitsis that Orthodox men wear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He feels a weird loathing for this, but he smooths and arranges the tsitsis to look just like a Hasid's. He clicks his heels together and gives a Nazi salute.

</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Danny turns: it's Drake. These are the first words he's spoken.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SUBURBAN STREET/INT. CAR -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny and Drake pass a low-slung modern synagogue. A sign announces: AMBASSADOR ILIO MANZETTI Friday, August 31. Danny reacts, startled...Drake smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Park up there, we'll walk back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRAKE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CONGREGATION BETH SHALOM -- TWILIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The building is lit. Within we hear an AMPLIFIED VOICE, presumably Manzetti giving a speech. We can't make out the words. Danny and Drake are hidden among the rhododendrons flanking the parking lot. Danny is watching a door in the side of the building and eating a sandwich as Drake loads a scoped rifle.
</DIRECTION>
<DRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lie on your stomach and come up on your elbows.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRAKE>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to kill a Jew. I already did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRAKE>
<DIRECTION>
Danny assumes the prone position, Drake sets the rifle in his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who'd you kill?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Four. But no one this important.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRAKE>
<DIRECTION>
We hear APPLAUSE within as the speech ends.
</DIRECTION>
<DRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, it's over. He'll take a couple questions, then come out.... Sight down the rifle toward the door.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRAKE>
<DIRECTION>
THROUGH RIFLE SCOPE: Danny pans from the side door -- where TWO MEN are smoking -- to a waiting limousine.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did you know they were Jews?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can tell....
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRAKE>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was a Jew in a previous life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRAKE>
<DIRECTION>
Before Danny can respond, Drake gestures toward the synagogue.
</DIRECTION>
<DRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here they come.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRAKE>
<DIRECTION>
Danny puts his eye back to the scope.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCOPE POV: stirring at the door. The men put out their cigarettes. Three figures emerge: a MAN and a WOMAN on either side of an older, distinguished-looking man (MANZETTI). They walk this way.
</DIRECTION>
<DRAKE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shoot him in the head. Always shoot a Jew in the head.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRAKE>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a bad shot. I don't think I can --
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DRAKE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just get him in the cross-hairs. With those shells, anywhere you hit him, it'll bounce around, rip his insides all up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRAKE>
<DIRECTION>
SCOPE POV: the TRIO walking this way, cross-hairs on Manzetti.
</DIRECTION>
<DRAKE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right there! Just squeeze he trigger. Slow... Do it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRAKE>
<DIRECTION>
Danny FIRES, misses. Everybody hits the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You missed on purpose.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRAKE>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't. I told you, I can't --
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRAKE>
<DIRECTION>
Danny looks over his shoulder. His shirt has ridden up his back, revealing the tallis wrapped around his waist.
</DIRECTION>
<DRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I knew it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRAKE>
<DIRECTION>
Drake pulls a .45 from the duffel.... Without thinking, Danny rolls over, fires the rifle. Drake is blown backward, dropping the .45.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny leaps up.... Drake's on his hands and knees, his trousers quickly darkening with blood. Danny's upset.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Jesus...Drake, are you okay...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
FOOTSTEPS, coming this way. Danny runs. We hear voices, "Get down.... Stay down.... He's got a gun...." Drake picks himself up, stumbles away, bent over....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. QUEENS -- DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny parks the van in an abandoned lot near the river. Quickly wiping down the wheel with his shirt, he tosses out his duffel bag and the scoped rifle. He climbs out, wipes down the door, throws the rifle into the water, grabs the duffel and hurries away.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kyle, it's me Danny. How you doing?... I had to come into the city to see Mrs. MOEBIUS... No, I gave Drake the van, didn't he bring it back?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DANNY'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny's on the phone, whipping through several newspapers.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Since when?... Really? And he didn't call?... No, I don't know...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
He finds a tiny item: "Gunfire Reported at Synagogue." He scans it: no mention of Drake or himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, come on down.... Can you bring my stuff?... Thanks...and if Drake shows up, let me know right away.... Good...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
He hangs up. From behind some books, he extracts the small caliber handgun he found in his father's house earlier.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MRS. MOEBIUS'S APARTMENT -- TWILIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny alone, waiting, nervous. He hears FOOTSTEPS approach, he touches the gun in the back of his trousers. Lina and Curtis enter.
</DIRECTION>
<LINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How have things been going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINA>
<DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
(how much do they know?)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<LINA>
<DIRECTION>
(indicates a chair)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We want to talk to you about something....
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as they sit, Danny nervous)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're about to launch an aboveground, intellectually serious fascist movement.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINA>
<DIRECTION>
Danny is relieved and intrigued. Lina nods at Curtis to go on.
</DIRECTION>
<CURTIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We want to build bridges to certain positions in the political mainstream: works like The Bell Curve, Sociobiology, anti-Zionism, anti- immigration, the com-munitarian issue.... We'll hold conferences: invite liberals, blacks, Jews. Chomsky, Cockburn, Stanley Crouch, Shahack....
	</DIALOGUE>
</CURTIS>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been waiting all my life for something like this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<MRS_MOEBIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We want you to help run it. Give speeches, lead seminars... Handle the fund-raising.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MOEBIUS>
<DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
(slapped in the face)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fund-raising??
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<MRS_MOEBIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We think you'd be good at it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MOEBIUS>
<DIRECTION>
OFF-SCREEN we hear the front door. FEET come up the stairs....
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about...Manzetti, the synagogues....
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<CURTIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That doesn't seem to be happening, does it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CURTIS>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been stuck out in the country with those guys who just want to paint swastikas and heil Hitler. How am I supposed to --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(get anything done there?)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stops short as Carla walks into the room for shopping. She glances at them, puts down her bags, goes into the kitchen....
</DIRECTION>
<CURTIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Danny, the night we met, you said the name Ilio Manzetti. We were impressed. We were excited. But here it is September, and Mr. Manzetti is still walking around breathing the air.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CURTIS>
<MRS_MOEBIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We need intellectuals, we have enough thugs already.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MOEBIUS>
<DIRECTION>
Danny's watching Carla go down the hall toward the back, can barely bring his attention back to the conversation at hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not an intellectual.... I mean, I read, but... Fund-raising isn't what I...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<MRS_MOEBIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, if you want to kill Jews on your free time, fine. We need you to raise money. Will you do that for us?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MOEBIUS>
<DIRECTION>
He nods but cannot look at her.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_MOEBIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MOEBIUS>
<DIRECTION>
He's dismissed. He rises.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_MOEBIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you have a suit?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off Danny; to Curtis)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's get him one.... And a cell phone too.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as Danny turns to go; a joke for her own amusement)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And if you insist on blowing up a synagogue, make it that big one on Fifth Avenue, would you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MOEBIUS>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Beth Shalom? It's Reform.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<MRS_MOEBIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MOEBIUS>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're not that Jewish.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<MRS_MOEBIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't care what they are. I know those people, and I don't like them. The rest are just a bunch of kikes, aren't they?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MOEBIUS>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles. He manages a smile back and hurries away, face burning with shame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MOEBIUS APARTMENT, STREET -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny comes out of the building, squats between two parked cars and vomits, retching spastically until, gasping for breath...
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
He turns. Carla walks over to him, wipes his mouth with a crumpled tissue. When she moves to kiss him, he holds back, shy about the smell, but she kisses him anyway, on the mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DANNY'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carla, naked, browsing the books, sees something in the closet. It's the Torah Danny took from the synagogue. She unrolls it on the bed, her gaze moving over the mysterious, glossy script. Danny, coming out of the bathroom, sees what she is doing, and stops short.
</DIRECTION>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where'd you get this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I stole it. From a synagogue.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at the broad printed columns....
</DIRECTION>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How come there's no punctuation?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was a later invention, it's not in the scrolls.... Anyway, the Jews know where the sentences end. They know the whole thing by heart. Every word. Every letter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know it like that? By heart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you can read it, the Hebrew.... Right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you care?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Cause I want to know.... What is this word? This one here...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<DIRECTION>
Danny looks at the word, then back at her. He's torn between competing desires, but finally...
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Va-yomer... And he said.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she moves her finger to the left)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It goes the other way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<CARLA>
<DIRECTION>
(she knew that)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yeah...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(moves finger right)
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Va-yomer adonai el Avram: lech lecha mayartzcha oo-mimohlad-tcha oo-m'bayt avaycha el ha-ertez asher arecha...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's it mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And God said to Avram, take yourself away from your land and from the place you were born and from your father's house into the land -- a different land -- and I will show you....
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
Danny remains silent a moment, affected by the passage....
</DIRECTION>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to learn to read it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Know your enemy.... 'Cause it's a basic text of Western culture. I want to read it in the original. Okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hebrew's very difficult. It would take years.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm good at languages.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at the smooth expanse of her back, the articulations of her spine. He finds her very beautiful.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put something on. You're not supposed to be naked in front of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They think it's the word of God, and it's holy, and the flesh isn't....
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's stupid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, it's stupid.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(indicating her T-shirt)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put it on, or I won't teach you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
She grudgingly pulls on the shirt as he gets a pencil and paper.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See, the Jews love to separate things: the holy from the profane, milk from meat, wool from linen, the Sabbath from the week, the Jew from the gentile.... As if one little scrap of this was going to completely contaminate that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What assholes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't curse in front of it either.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
He shrugs as if indifferent to these rules, yet compelled to point them out.
</DIRECTION>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who gets contaminated, the Jews or the gentiles?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good question. Both.

<DIRECTION>
(draws a letter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aleph...

</DANNY>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It looks a little like a swastika.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's silent. It holds a place, takes a vowel. The vowels are little dots that go under the letters.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are they?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They don't put them in the Torah. I'll get you a chumash, they'll have them there...Bet...Gimel...Dalid...Hay...

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How come you're here instead of with Curtis? Besides the Hebrew lessons...

Danny and Kyle.

<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This will be a different kind of device.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYLE>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That damn thing. You know how it made me look...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, Danny. It won't happen again. I'm going to use a brand-new power cell. Plus we'll have a back-up timer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYLE>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've gotta kill some Jews, Kyle. I'm serious. I'm always talking about it. This time it's gotta happen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It will.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYLE>
<DIRECTION>
Kyle's confident, and the prospect of this really happening gives Danny pause. He feels a brief chill, escapes it with...
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about Drake, did he ever show up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it's weird, man. Nobody knows where he went.

Danny nods, gestures for Kyle to split. Kyle looks around, walks away. Danny waits a moment, then heads in the opposite direction.

EXT. WILLIAMSBURG -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny walking behind a Hasidic family (MAN, WOMAN, 3-year- old BOY, STROLLER)...watching them. At a corner, the father takes the boy's hand, and as they cross the street, the boy glances back at Danny.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COUNTRY ROAD -- DAY, 1943
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO NAZI SOLDIERS have just discovered a JEWISH FAMILY hiding in the back of a hay wagon. The POLISH MAN is holding the little boy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As a soldier tries to take the BOY out of his arms, the child panics, clings to his father, screaming, "Papa... Papa..." It is the scene the survivor described in the meeting with the Nazis. But now the father is DANNY'S FATHER....

	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, sweetheart, you have to go. I'll see you soon.

<DIRECTION>
In an access of disgust, the sergeant sticks his bayonet into the boy -- or rather, into something offscreen. We hear a terrible sound, the child grunts. The family gasps in horror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny/sergeant lifts the (unseen) child into the air. Its SHADOW darkens the father's face. Drops of blood run down his cheeks....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny/sergeant stares into the father's face, enraged at the man's passivity.

	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
He glances at Miriam; but she has picked up the book he'd been reading, is leafing through it. It makes him uneasy.
</DIRECTION>
<STUART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's great seeing you....
	</DIALOGUE>
</STUART>
<MIRIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe Danny'd like to come to the minyan for the holidays....
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRIAM>
<DIRECTION>
Danny gives her a dirty look, but Stuart's thrilled:
</DIRECTION>
<STUART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, good idea. We're davening with this group from the seminary. Interesting people, very open-minded, you might like them. And guess who comes...Avi! You guys could go at it again like the good old days.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STUART>
<DIRECTION>
As Stuart scribbles an address...
</DIRECTION>
<STUART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Danny and Avi used to argue about everything. Torah, Talmud, politics, girls. It always ended in a fistfight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STUART>
<MIRIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I remember.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRIAM>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I always won.

</DANNY>
<MIRIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The arguments, anyway.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRIAM>
<STUART>
<DIRECTION>
(hands Danny the address)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a K.I. on 101st. In the little chapel. Try to make it. It'd be fun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STUART>
<DIRECTION>
Danny smiles. He has no intention of going. Once they leave, he picks up the book and resumes reading.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AN EXECUTIVE SUITE -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROGER BRAND, a high-powered CEO, sits behind a big desk, speed-reading something through half-glasses. He finishes, removes the glasses. A New York Times is on the desk.
</DIRECTION>
<BRAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You write that?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as Danny nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come work for me. You've got a lot to learn; I can teach it to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAND>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have a job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<BRAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This? This is a joke.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(tossing down the pages)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll give your group a thousand bucks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAND>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You gave fifty thousand to that college magazine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<BRAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fifty's an exaggeration. Anyway, that was a different moment. Things were possible that aren't now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAND>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, I think this moment has possibilities that --
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<BRAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I read your piece. It's very smart. And very wrong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAND>
<DIRECTION>
Brand's phone beeps, he touches a button, continues.
</DIRECTION>
<BRAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forget the Jewish stuff. It doesn't play anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(over Danny's)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's only the market, now, and it doesn't care who you are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAND>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	People still need values, beliefs....

</DANNY>
<BRAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, they don't. Not the smart ones.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(because he likes him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I'll give you five grand if you can document your tax-exempt status.... But when you fall off this horse, come see me. I can show you how to make a lot of money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAND>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't care about money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<BRAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You will.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAND>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a Jew. Maybe you don't realize it, but you are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<BRAND>

(smiles, uninsulted)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe I am. Maybe we're all Jews now. What's the difference?

</BRAND>
<DIRECTION>
On Danny, troubled by this.

<DIRECTION>
INT. A SMALL LECTURE HALL -- EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A half-dozen white lumpen sit at desks. Danny writes "ANTI- SEMITISM" in large letters on a blackboard. He turns....
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How many of you think of yourselves as anti-Semites?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(All the hands go up.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. Actually, the term is a bit imprecise since technically Jews are only one of the Semitic peoples.... In fact, Arabs are Semites, as are the Eritreans, the Ethiopians, and so on.... But for our purposes an anti- Semite is someone who hates or is against Jews.... Now, why do we hate them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
He looks around. The room is silent.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me put it another way. Do we hate them because they push their way in where they don't belong? Or because they're clannish and keep to themselves?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
Murmurs of "Yeah. Both." But some are confused by this.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SAME -- ANOTHER DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slightly bigger crowd, a few middle-class-looking people.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Because they're tight with money, or because they flash it around? Because they're Bolsheviks or because they're capitalists? Because they have the highest IQs, or because they have the most active sex lives?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
The audience, confused...
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you want to know the real reason we hate them?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SAME -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...More people: white collar workers of both sexes, nurses, artists. Lapel buttons, bumper stickers, backpacks: "FIGHT NEW WORLD DISORDER" "STOP THE WTO" "EARTH FIRST!"
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Because we hate them.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as people exchange puzzled looks)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because they exist. Because it is an axiom of civilization that just as man longs for woman, loves his children and fears death, he hates the Jews.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is no reason. If there were, some smart-ass kike would give us an argument, try to prove we were wrong. And of course that would only make us hate them more. In fact we have all the reasons we need in three simple letters: J-E-W. Jew. Say it a million times. It is the only word that never loses its meaning: Jew Jew Jew Jew Jew Jew Jew Jew Jew Jew Jew Jew Jew....

<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's a fascist?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<AVI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I rest my case. He's a Jewish Nazi. He always was.

</AVI>
<DANNY>

	Whereas Avi's a Zionist Nazi.

</DANNY>
<AVI>

	You know the joke: a Jew's shipwrecked on a desert island. When they rescue him, they see he's built two synagogues. They say, for vhat do you need two synagogues? He says, vun to pray in, and vun I'd never set foot in so long as I live, so help me God.

Puzzled mutterings: "What?... What's he talking about?..."
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did he say love them? Love the Jews? It sounds strange, I know, but with these people nothing is simple. The Jew says that all he wants is to be left alone to study his Torah, do a little business and fornicate with his over-sexed wife.... But it isn't true. He wants to be hated. He longs for our scorn. He clings to it as if it were the very core and mystery of his being. If Hitler had not existed, the Jews would have invented him. For without such hatred, the so-called Chosen People would vanish from the earth....
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
People react with confusion, uncertainty, suspicion.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...And this reveals a terrible truth, the crux of our problem as Nazis: the worse the Jews are treated, the stronger they become. Egyptian slavery made them a nation; the pogroms hardened them, Auschwitz gave birth to the State of Israel. Suffering, it seems, is the very crucible of their genius. If the Jews are, as one of their own has said, a people who will not take yes for an answer, then let us say yes to them. If they thrive on opposition, let us cease to oppose them. The way to annihilate them, utterly and completely, is to open our arms, take them into our homes and embrace them. Only then will they vanish into assimilation, dilution...and love.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a warning finger)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But we cannot pretend. The Jew is nothing if not clever. He will see through condescension and hypocrisy. To destroy him, we will have to love him sincerely.

ON THE AUDIENCE, befuddled. A HAND goes up. Danny nods to it. The man steps forward, and we see that it's Guy Danielsen of the Times. Danny is shaken....

	But if the Jews are strengthened by hate, wouldn't this "destruction" you speak of -- by love or by any other means -- in fact make them more powerful than they are already?

Murmurs of confusion, outrage... "God??!!!" Danny notices the TALLIS crawling out from under his shirt, stuffs it back in.

	It is the Jews' destiny to the annihilated so that they can be deified....

A PENCIL BEAM shows Kyle on his back attaching the bomb to some kind of wooden floor cupboard. He's worried about the paltry amount of explosives.

EXT. EIGHTH AVENUE NEWSSTAND -- NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
A stack of papers, the early edition of the Times. As Danny grabs one, he notices a stack of tabloids....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FRONT PAGE: The Manzetti crime scene with screaming headline: "MANZETTI SLAYER JEWISH NAZI." Next to this another tab: "JEW KILLS JEW?"

Danny grabs a Times, flips it over... We see only his face: registering this, unsurprised. He opens the paper....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT: TWO PHOTOGRAPHS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sweet-faced bar mitzvah boy we saw at his father's house... And a BLURRY PHOTO of Danny walking away from Guy Danielsen and the photographer outside Mrs. Moebius's house. Danny's face is not clearly seen.

TILT UP TO DANNY

Calm. He tucks the paper under his arm beside the machzor and crosses Eighth Avenue toward a cheap hotel....

	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean?

<MRS_MOEBIUS>

	I think anti-semitism today is largely a Jewish phenomenon. Wouldn't you agree?

Danny can't help smiling at her audacity.
</DIRECTION>
<REPORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In the Third Reich, weren't a number of high-ranking Nazis of Jewish origin?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REPORTER>
<MRS_MOEBIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, and they were said to be the most virulent proponents of the Final Solution. Really, who but a Jew would want to kill Ilio Manzetti simply because he was Jewish? Who thinks about such things?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MOEBIUS>
<REPORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The papers are going to report tomorrow that your colleague, Curtis Zampf, has been a federal informant for the past two years. Do you believe that?

The Stocky Young Man beckons him on. As he passes, Danny spots a gun and shoulder holster inside the man's zippered jacket.

Several Yom Kippur services are going on in different rooms. And we hear different groups of VOICES. And one reading...

INT. JEWISH COMMUNITY CENTER, 2ND FLOOR/INT. SMALL AUDITORIUM -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
About forty WORSHIPPERS, most in their 20s and 30s. Danny slips into the back, spots Carla up front with Miriam and Stuart. He's shocked, appalled....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CARLA -- trying to follow along the prayer book, suddenly Danny is leaning over her shoulder from the row behind.

EXT. FOREST ROAD -- DAY, 1943
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Jewish father (played by Danny's father) is ripping open the Sergeant's jugular as the soldiers shoot him. One of the soldiers (who is now Danny) says:
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY_NAZI_SOLDIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kill them. Kill them all.

The soldiers begin firing.... But now, three Israeli commandos appear, Danny, Avi and the security guard we saw outside. They fire Uzis at the Nazis, who fire back.

Danny the Nazi soldier and Danny the Israeli commando fire at each other at point-blank range. The SOUND fades and we hear SCRAPING CHAIRS, MURMURS, VOICES....

Danny wakes with a start. People are about to resume after a break, but there's some confusion. People are talking to Stuart, who keeps glancing toward Danny....Danny finds his machzor and gets up...as he approaches the bema, Stuart comes to meet him.

	Danny, listen, people expect me to daven; they don't want someone they don't know -- leading their prayers.

INT. SMALL AUDITORIUM -- TWILIGHT

<DIRECTION>
The windows have darkened. The congregation is on its feet chanting the AVINU MALKENU, the climactic prayer of the day.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny, leading the prayers, looks up at Carla, Stuart, Miriam...near the front, chanting with him. He looks at the clock: 7:21.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly it seems impossible to go through with this. He stops praying, but no one notices....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JEWISH COMMUNITY CENTER -- TWILIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Kyle, Drake and Billings approach, the place seems to glow with an inner radiance. Drake and Billings hold weapons at their sides.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The stocky security guard sees them coming and gets up, reaching for his gun. Billings and Drake stop. Kyle wishes he weren't here.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everything suspends for a moment as, within the building, three distinct GROUPS OF VOICES can be heard, each chanting the AVINU MALKENU at a slightly different point in the prayer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Drake raises his gun and fires.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JEWISH COMMUNITY CENTER -- SMALL AUDITORIUM -- TWILIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
People are chanting AVINU MALKENU so fervently that the GUNFIRE outside seems only a faint POPPING. No one particularly notices. Danny, freaking, doesn't hear the gunshots. He tries to address the people in the front rows....
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a minute...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
But the praying is too loud, too strong. No one stops or listens. He steps down off the bema....
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop praying. You've got to get out of here.... All of you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
A few people in front are puzzled by his strange behavior, but the rest keep chanting. Stuart comes up to Danny....
</DIRECTION>
<STUART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wanted to daven. Now daven....
	</DIALOGUE>
</STUART>
<DIRECTION>
Danny glances over people's heads at the clock: 7:25. He doesn't notice...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE DOOR
</DIRECTION>

BANGS open. DRAKE stands there, .357, bleeding profusely from the head, the swastika on his lips. At first, only a few people notice, they stop praying.

Drake shoots him. Avi goes down, writhing in pain. Screams, panic. People come at Drake, but he grabs an 11-year-old girl, puts the gun to her head.

Drake moves unsteadily toward the front, pulling the girl with him. A WOMAN (a doctor) goes to tend Avi, who is still conscious. People begin to slip out the back, taking children. Others stay, looking to jump Drake, but he keeps the .357 on the little girl.

Drake looks. Danny reaches out a hand. Drake points the .357 at him and FIRES, missing. A HAND grabs the little girl, pulls her to safety.

Drake FIRES again, hits Danny in the shoulder....
