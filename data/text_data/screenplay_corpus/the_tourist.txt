EXT. PARIS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CRANE DOWN from a view of Paris on a misty day. Cool, gray and beautiful.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A taxi stops by the curb of a wide, cobbled street. All around there is bustle and activity, with cars and people hurrying about their business.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens and a pair of exquisitely shaped female legs in Christian Louboutin high heels swing out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GARE DE L'EST, PARIS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE FOLLOW the legs up the steps, across the concourse, through the station. Men turn and stare.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CARA MASON (30, stunning) shows no sign of noticing. She wears dark glasses and carries a traveling bag in one hand, a copy of the International Herald Tribune in the other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BRASSERIE, GARE DE L'EST - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A YOUNG WAITER wiping down the bar stops to watch Cara enter and take a seat at a table slightly set apart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An OLDER WAITER approaches her. They exchange a few words and he walks toward the bar.
</DIRECTION>
<WAITER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's waiting for someone.

</WAITER>
<YOUNGER_WAITER>

</WAITER>
<DIRECTION>
A MESSENGER clad in leather, wearing a motorcycle helmet, enters the cafe and looks around. He consults a photograph.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes land on Cara. He walks over and holds out a document-sized envelope.
</DIRECTION>
<MESSENGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'est vous, Mademoiselle?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MESSENGER>
<CARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oui.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARA>
<DIRECTION>
As the messenger walks away she opens the folder and shakes out the contents. There is a ticket for the Orient Express and a handwritten letter...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She spreads it out on the table like a precious treasure map. Her beautiful forehead creases with concentration as she reads...
</DIRECTION>
<ALEXANDER_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (English accent)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They are following you Cara.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEXANDER_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
She looks up. Takes out a small makeup mirror and holds it in front of her face to glance around behind her...
</DIRECTION>
<ALEXANDER_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They think you'll lead them to me. But if you follow my instructions closely, there is a way for us to get away...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEXANDER_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Cara scans the rest of the letter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA glides down to see the signature at the bottom: "Love, Alexander."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We barely have time to read this before Cara's perfectly manicured hand crumples the letter, places it in a saucer and sets fire to it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The YOUNG WAITER hurries over, alarmed.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNGER_WAITER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mademoiselle! Je vous en prie--
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNGER_WAITER>
<DIRECTION>
Cara is already gathering her things and walking away.

INT. GARE DE L'EST STATION - MOMENTS LATER

As Cara walks toward the platform...
</DIRECTION>
<ALEXANDER_S_VOICE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take the 4:25 Orient Express to Venice. En route select a man my approximate height and weight...

	Have faith Cara. I'll be with you soon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEXANDER_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
CARA'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Men of various shapes and sizes are boarding "The Orient Express." She pauses only long enough to assess and discard: too old, too young, too thin, too overweight...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her gaze comes to rest on a WELL-DRESSED FRENCH MAN. Medium height, medium build. Standing alone. Examining his ticket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cara glances at her reflection critically in the polished glass window of the train. Adjusts her hair and dress.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Satisfied with what she sees, she turns and starts toward the WELL-DRESSED FRENCH MAN like a cat stalking prey.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA admiringly FOLLOWS her silky approach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The FRENCH MAN hears the click of her heels and looks up. His mouth falls open...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS WIFE arrives and shuts it for him.
</DIRECTION>
<WIFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing Vincent? Our train car is over here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WIFE>
<DIRECTION>
With a regretful backward glance at Cara, he allows himself to be dragged away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frustrated, Cara turns and casts about for another possibility.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She spots a TOUSLE HAIRED MAN seated on a bench.
</DIRECTION>
<CONDUCTER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All aboard! All aboard the 4:25 is departing!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONDUCTER>
<DIRECTION>
Tousle Hair gathers his bags to get on the train. Encouraged, Cara moves to cut him off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Tousle Hair stands up REVEAL... he's six foot seven.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cara stops short, irritated. The MAN behind her boarding the train is fumbling with his suitcase and doesn't notice. BAM he walks straight into her.
</DIRECTION>
<CARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ow!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARA>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry! Excuse me. Pardone moi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
FRANK TAYLOR (30's, amiable) is a cheerful American tourist. Open face, completely lacking in guile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank continues to mutter apologies as he walks gingerly around Cara and boards the train.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cara watches him with thinly veiled contempt. Frank is a man of average size, average build... she peers over her glasses at him. And her expression slowly changes. She follows him onto the train.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A GOOD-LOOKING ENGLISHMAN loitering further down the platform, reading the Herald Tribune. Or rather, not reading it. He's been watching Cara. He lowers the paper and climbs onto the train through a different door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARIS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The gleaming Orient Express pulls out of the station and gets underway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ORIENT EXPRESS - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The train is moving.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The thick carpet, the mellow wood of the inlaid panels, the subtlety of the Lalique mirrors and the softly lit lamps all inspire a feeling of great luxury.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank looks vaguely out of place, sitting by the window in his casual jeans and pullover sweater. He's wrapped up in a dog-eared paperback spy novel. So wrapped up that he barely notices Cara sit down opposite him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She crosses her legs. He glances up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly, nonchalantly, she takes her coat off. Then the headscarf tied around her neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FOLLOW her sensual movements in TIGHT CLOSE UP. The effect is as if she's performing a tantalizing strip tease.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank is captivated to the point of being unsettled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She takes off her glasses to reveal stunning eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She goes to remove her mock-turtleneck sweater. The zipper seems to give her trouble.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Without bothering to struggle she sits up in her seat and leans toward Frank.
</DIRECTION>
<CARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I'm going to need your help.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARA>
<DIRECTION>
Frank is barely able to respond.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hmm?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<CARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My zipper...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off his blank look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's stuck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARA>
<DIRECTION>
Frank finally moves into action. He sets his book down and leans closer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Awkwardly he reaches towards Cara's beautiful neck. He attempts to unwind the trapped thread of fabric. But the zipper resists.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm afraid of hurting you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
She slides forward on her seat, to get even closer.
</DIRECTION>
<CARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be afraid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARA>
<DIRECTION>
The train car sways slightly and throws Frank off balance. He tugs sharply and the zipper suddenly gives-- with a tearing sound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank freezes, looking down at the zipper still in his fingers.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm... sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Cara's eyes flash fury for a brief moment.
</DIRECTION>
<CARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It doesn't matter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARA>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe I should let you do this--
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<CARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't give up so quickly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARA>
<DIRECTION>
Reluctantly, Frank continues with the zipper. The tearing sound continues as he lowers the zipper, inch by inch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
First her neck, then her throat, then her cleavage are gradually uncovered. The zipper keeps going downward. No sign of anything underneath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank is practically sweating.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally he uncovers fabric. He finishes unzipping the sweater and sits back into his seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cara slides it off her shoulders, sensuous as ever.
</DIRECTION>
<CARA>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>

Ackerman shakes the doorknob, cursing; a Tall Commander calls for the BATTERING RAM which is rushed up the stairs...

The tactics team CRACKS the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ackerman charges into...

THE BEDROOM

Cara stands frozen beside the man's effects on the night table. The wallet. The keys. The watch.

<ACKERMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is he?

</ACKERMAN>
<DIRECTION>
On the other side of the room, Ackerman sees an OPEN WINDOW, which the ocean breeze swings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rushing forward he sticks his head out the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hanging outside the window is the rigging for a WINDOW WASHER'S PLATFORM - a platform that seconds before was lowered to the sand below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the distance, a recently boarded water taxi pulls away from the dock and sails out into the lagoon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ackerman turns to face the study.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the desk is a cup of coffee with steam gently rising from its surface. A cigarette sits lit in an ashtray, the smoke curling toward the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ackerman stares at the empty, slowly revolving, chair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks toward CARA, now in custody. He holds her defiant gaze for a moment.

	Nobody knows. He disappeared after his escape. He's had extensive plastic surgery to alter his appearance since then. Drug lord Amado Carillo did the same thing in the 90s to successfully elude authorities.

</ACKERMAN>
<QUINN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you know about it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUINN>
<ACKERMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pearce worked with no more than a few accomplices at one time. He treated them so well that they're virtually all completely loyal. None of them would cooperate. We've questioned the ones we could find, and the only thing we learned is that Pearce apparently arranged it so even his own people have never seen him after the surgery.

	Correct.

</ACKERMAN>
<JEAN_LUC>

	Forgive me for saying so Mr. Ackerman, but he slipped away from you when you knew his whereabouts and his appearance... What makes you think you can catch him now?

INT. TRAIN CAR - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank's eyes drift open. He glances out the window and as his vision comes into focus he sees that the train is stopped. He sits bolt upright.
</DIRECTION>

A CONDUCTOR'S VOICE over the loudspeaker is saying something in Italian.

Frank stumbles over himself to collect his things: book, sweater, pills, etc.

Frank hurries over.

She nods at Frank. For a second, the receptionist cannot keep the surprise out of his eyes. This glamorous, superbly dressed creature is married to a dull, American tourist in a T-shirt?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He recovers his composure and alters his manner at once.

Demidov sips a glass of red wine. The view from his room rivals the one at the Danieli but Demidov pays no attention. He's busy scanning his emails on his Blackberry.

Knock, knock. A thick-necked BODYGUARD in the background goes to answer the door. A moment later...

He ushers in Quinn, the Swiss Interpol agent.

Demidov makes a gesture and a second BODYGUARD with a SCAR on his face gives Quinn an envelope filled with cash.

Quinn tucks it away discreetly, as if embarrassed by the directness of the pay off.

Demidov looks at Quinn thoughtfully.
</DIRECTION>
<DEMIDOV>

	It may be difficult for you to understand, Mr. Quinn; you Swiss are mercenary by nature. But for some of us, there are things more important than money. I put my trust in Alexander Pearce. He betrayed that trust.

</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What... what did I do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
She pauses at the door. Her expression softens slightly.
</DIRECTION>
<CARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing. I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARA>
<DIRECTION>
Then she disappears into her bedroom. The door closes behind her and we hear the click of the lock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank remains standing alone, immobile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After several moments he sits on the sofa. There are two folded blankets and a pillow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From within Cara's bedroom we can hear her voice, muffled but still audible...
</DIRECTION>
<CARA>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...that's exactly what I'm doing, but now I want him to go...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARA>
<DIRECTION>
He approaches the door, straining to hear more but her words fade out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank gets ready for bed. He takes off the watch Cara gave him and something on the back of it catches his eye. It's engraved with a name:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALEXANDER PEARCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stares at the name for a moment, then unzips his travel bag. Takes out his pills. Pops a bunch. Brushes his teeth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pauses and stares at himself in the mirror as if wondering how in the world he ended up here. It's like he's staring into the face of stranger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He puts his tooth brush down and pads off to sleep on the sofa.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DOGE'S SUITE - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of the SHOWER reaches Frank in his sleep. He blinks his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The morning is misty. He closes the balcony doors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cara's bedroom door is ajar. Frank struggles not to notice. He turns to his bed and begins folding sheets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he hears the sound of water running in the shower.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He glances over at the door ajar, the sound of the shower... it's too much.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank walks to the bedroom door. He pushes it open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door to Cara's bathroom is open. The outline of her naked body is visible in the shower. She lifts her wet hair and soaps the back of her neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She sees him. Cara is so stunned she simply stands there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank walks to the shower and opens the glass door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walking in, he LIFTS Cara against the glass, clutching at her slithery body, kissing her frantically...she kisses him back with ardor, wrapping her dripping legs around his back...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT BACK TO REALITY:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DOGE'S SUITE - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank is sleeping. A smile on his face. A shadow passes over him as somebody walks past.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A man's trouser leg is visible in the foreground, moving slowly toward Frank. Then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLANG! Frank wakes with a start to see......
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A WAITER is setting up breakfast on a cart.
</DIRECTION>
<WAITER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pardone Signore. Good morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAITER>
<DIRECTION>
Frank stares in surprise at the food spread out before him.
</DIRECTION>
<WAITER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	La Signora ordered this for you when she left.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAITER>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When she...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
He looks around the suite. He is alone. He nods.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
The waiter has finished. He hovers for a moment...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally Frank takes the hint and gives the man a one Euro tip. He takes it with disdain and leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank throws off his blanket and sits up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CARA'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank strolls into the room, barefoot, in his boxers. The bed is unmade.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cara has left a shirt over a chair... he picks it up and holds it to his face for a moment to enjoy her lingering scent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He notices a newspaper... a copy of The International Herald Tribune is open on her bedside table. He lifts it to see what Cara had been reading.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a personal ad that has been lightly dotted with a ball point pen. The message is just a list of words:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"TOM CORRY NOW IN A MICA CAN IF FEELING PEST STILL AROUND."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dots single out letters in a code... Frank picks up the pen and puts a faint line through the groups of unselected letters to reveal the message:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"Tomorrow 11 Caffe Pesaro"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank studies this for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BUZZER SOUNDS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Laying the paper on the table, Frank walks to the door.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Breakfast.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Frank reaches for the doorknob... then pauses. Breakfast again?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He quietly slides the chain on. Peers through the spyhole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SPYHOLE POV -- Two tough-looking men in suits stand there: most definitely not hotel staff. One has a scar on his face... Demidov's BODYGUARDS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank is frozen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scarface takes out a silenced PISTOL and mutters something in Russian to his partner. He produces a LOCK PICK SET and crouches out of frame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank hears the sound of scratching metal and clicking tumblers inside the lock. He looks around wildly. Sees the KEY on the entryway table and reaches for it...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ch-chunk. The Russian picks the lock and slowly starts to open the door. The chain stops it. A pause.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A moment later a KNIFE comes through the crack and starts to slide the chain...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank stares at the knife; he has to act fast...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank throws his shoulder against the door. The knife clatters to the floor as the door slams shut. Frank jams his KEY into the lock and turns the bolt into place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's angry confusion on the other side of the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank grabs a heavy glass ashtray and swings it at the back of the key-- breaking it off in the lock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank scrambles out of the way...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of metal scraping in the lock. Russian CURSING can be heard just outside. A heavy blow as they try to shoulder the door open...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank looks around desperately for an escape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bathroom? The sitting room? Adjoining doors? None.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's nowhere to go.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank bolts for the balcony in his bare feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He scrambles outside as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POP! POP! POP! Bullets rip through the wood and metal, blasting the lock assembly apart. The door bursts open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BALCONY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank looks down and stares at the
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DIZZYING SIX STORY DROP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
to the cobblestones of the Ponte del Vin below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Guests sit on their balconies with their morning coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Three balconies over, Frank sees the rooftop of the modern wing of the hotel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE SUITE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two TOUGHS rapidly move through the room, searching. Nyet, Nyet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The one place they haven't checked...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BALCONY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank puts one bare foot on the stonework. He grimaces as he HEAVES himself onto the railing of the balcony adjacent to his.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He hangs desperately, flailing, 100 feet over the street below. He gets a tentative hold...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A PALLID FRENCH WOMAN drops her coffee and screams.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Russians sprint out to the balcony. They spot Frank...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Who shoves the Pallid Woman inside, struggles past her breakfast table, and prepares to leap again-- but slips on the spilled coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bullets shatter China around him. He cuts his foot on a broken plate. He grabs his bleeding foot.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goddamn it! I'm a fucking tourist!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Another round of shots ring out. They don't seem to care.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank goes over the railing with another awkward HEAVE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His pursuers scale the adjoining stone work and step onto the Pallid Woman's balcony.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This time Frank lands in the lap of a BURLY WELSHMAN.
</DIRECTION>
<BURLY_WELSHMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are ya bloody mad?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURLY_WELSHMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The Burly Welshman PUNCHES Frank in the stomach, which drops him out of the way of...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO SHOTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Which explode into the Welshman's shoulder. He cries out and falls down on top of Frank.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Russians stand on the Pallid Woman's balcony and prepare to JUMP...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Frank crawls out from under the wounded Welshman and peers over the next balcony...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Which is at least TWENTY FEET from the roof.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He misjudged the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE WELSHMAN'S ROOM - SECONDS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank runs through the hotel room, past the Welshman's wife to the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SHOT behind him and pounding feet send him out into the corridor past a room service steward to an...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELEVATOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Which will not do but the--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SERVICE STAIRCASE - SECONDS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STAIRS will and Frank flies down the steps, three at a time, hearing his pursuers above him, running harder than he's run in his entire life...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But he's slow and they gain on him enough to aim weapons through the railing...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
P-CHING, several bullets ricochet like pinballs in the metal stairwell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank pants as he pushes out a side door...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RIO DEL VIN CANAL, VENICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank sprints along the edge of the canal, dodging tourists and children, vendors and locals. He spots a VENDOR'S three wheel BICYCLE and jumps on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he pedals, he realizes it's too slow so he JUMPS OFF...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
and FALLS - a painful spill, he cuts his hand - but clambers to his feet as the Russians bear down. Running up hidden stairs he finds the roof of a shop on the Riva Degli Schiavoni...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RIVA DEGLI SCHIAVONI, VENICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank runs down the ridge of the roof. A silenced shot hits roof tile nearby and throws him off balance. He FALLS...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...bumping down the other side of the roof until, as he topples over the edge, he thrusts a hand at the gutter, smashing his head against the wall. He drops onto the pavement along the edge of the small canal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He doubles back towards the lagoon. Looking back, he sees the men still in pursuit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns into the Campo San Zaccaria, scattering the flapping and fluttering PIGEONS. The Gondolieri and their passengers watch the half-naked man run past and cheer.
</DIRECTION>
<A_GONDOLIER>
<DIRECTION>
(in Italian)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Run faster, man!
	</DIALOGUE>
</A_GONDOLIER>
<DIRECTION>
The Russians force their way past the pedestrians. They have almost caught him when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LEATHER SHOP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ducking inside a leather shop, Frank heads straight for the back entrance and finds it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stands on the cobblestones. Blood streams from his forehead as well as his hand. He has
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SECONDS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
to decide which way to go. The alley is long and narrow on either side. An awning above. Clear sight lines.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The back of the shop upends the Grand Canal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Russians burst out the back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is no sign of Frank.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scarface looks at the Canal. He walks to the edge of the water and SPRAYS gun fire atop it. Nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIGH ANGLE OF SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank lies huddled on his back IN THE AWNING behind the leather shop, barely able to control his frantic breathing. He's mere feet away from the men who are trying to kill him...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up and sees: the scowling face of an Italian WOMAN peering out over her window box.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank raises a desperate finger to his lips. A prayer that she won't give him away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him disapprovingly. Then disappears back inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON FRANK as he waits, his heart pounding.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seconds tick past... is he safe?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rrrrrip! A black cylinder, like the barrel of a gun, tears through the awning fabric inches from his Frank's head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He cries out. The awning rips and dumps him down hard onto the cobblestones below...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MOMENTARY BLACKOUT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank opens his eyes and sees two pairs of black boots that belong to... A PAIR OF CARBINIERI who stand over him. One of them holds a nightstick.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They stare down at the bloodied tourist in his underpants lying at their feet. They've seen stranger things.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. POLIZIA "QUESTURA" (POLICE STATION) - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank sits alone with a blanket over his shoulders. Most of the blood has been wiped from his wound and he has a rough bandage on his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From down the hallway a cheery stubble-faced POLICE OFFICER, DOMENICO (30's, animated), walks into the room where Frank is waiting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Domenico laughs, talking on his cell phone as he enters.
</DIRECTION>
<DOMENICO>
<DIRECTION>
(in Italian)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't let them stay over, man. You start cuddling and then she wants to borrow your car. Stop cuddling, Tomaso!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMENICO>
<DIRECTION>
Frank stands.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me...

</FRANK>
<DOMENICO>

(suddenly noticing him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, what are you doing in here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMENICO>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The officers told me to wait here. I've been sitting here for over two hours...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Dominico glances over his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DOMENICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think they forgot about you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMENICO>
<DIRECTION>
Frank sits back down heavily. Domenico sits on the edge of a desk.
</DIRECTION>
<DOMENICO>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened to you, anyway?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMENICO>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Somebody tried to kill me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Domenico picks up Frank's statement and glances at it.
</DIRECTION>
<DOMENICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Taylor, wow, you had quite a day. Eh? We got chasing, we got shooting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMENICO>
<DIRECTION>
Domenico looks at mild-mannered Frank sitting there in his boxers. The story seems unlikely.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think I'm crazy but it's all true.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DOMENICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe you crazy AND it's true, my friend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMENICO>
<DIRECTION>
Domenico looks at Frank a little harder. Decides this guy is not making all this up.
</DIRECTION>
<DOMENICO>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, so who are these guys? Why they mad at you?

</DOMENICO>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have absolutely no idea.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DOMENICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They followed you from the Danieli?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMENICO>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They came to the room. They pretended to be room service.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DOMENICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't scopata one of their girlfriends or something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMENICO>
<FRANK>

	I didn't "scopata" anybody!

</FRANK>
<DOMENICO>

He consults a piece of paper.

Frank is quiet. Domenico playfully points at him.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I catch you, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMENICO>
<FRANK>

	<DIALOGUE>
	In America the cops catch the crooks, not the victim.

</FRANK>
<DOMENICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ha ha, we do that sometimes here, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMENICO>
<DIRECTION>
Domenico considers for a moment.

<DOMENICO>

(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is no domestic, then?

<DOMENICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How long you know Cara Mason?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMENICO>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I met her yesterday.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DOMENICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you take her to the Danieli? That must have been good meeting, yes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMENICO>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't take her. She took me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
The infectious grin again lights up Domenico's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DOMENICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You lead an exciting life, Mr. Taylor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMENICO>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not usually.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Domenico picks up the phone and dials a number. He talks in brisk Italian, listens again and replaces the receiver.
</DIRECTION>
<DOMENICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Signora Mason was staying with "her husband" last night. You marry her, Mr. Taylor?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMENICO>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DOMENICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think maybe Signora Mason might know why these guys behave badly. What do you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMENICO>
<DIRECTION>
Pause.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think that's possible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DOMENICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got a phone number, mobile?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMENICO>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She didn't give me one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Domenico looks him over.
</DIRECTION>
<DOMENICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You need some clothes. I'll be right back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMENICO>
<DIRECTION>
He leaves Frank alone again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank stands and half-heartedly follows him to the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He spots something in the adjoining room; a computer that has been left on. He wanders over and looks at the screen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An idea comes into Frank's head... he looks around. Nobody is watching him. He glances at the inscription on the WATCH...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then quickly sits down. He does a search for "WANTED INTERNATIONAL CRIMINALS" and types in the name:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALEXANDER PEARCE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An immediate hit in the data base. Alexander Pearce's page fills the screen. The caption reads:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
#6 on INTERPOL'S MOST WANTED LIST.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In place of a photograph there is just a black outline of a man's head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank is about to scan for more information when he hears Domenico returning. He quickly steps back into the room where he was left...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DOMENICO enters carrying a garish SWEAT SUIT. He hands it to Frank.
</DIRECTION>
<DOMENICO>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here. Put these on. Time to go.
	</DIALOGUE>

Frank looks at the clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Um... thanks. Where are we going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DOMENICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm taking you to the hospital, Mr. Taylor. A doctor should take a look at you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMENICO>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd really rather just go--

</FRANK>
<DOMENICO>

Frank lies flat on his back.

A NURSE leans over him with a kindly expression.
</DIRECTION>
<NURSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Relax signore. We're just going to make sure everything is all right inside your head.

She slides him slowly into the mouth of an MRI scanning machine head first. It hums to life.

Domenico gets down on his hands and knees and looks around. He spots something under the sofa and fishes it out with his penknife... a spent bullet casing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He puts it in a plastic bag, pleased with himself. Demidov catches his eye. He smiles at him.

As he and the clerk exit, Scarface steps out from the other room. Off Demidov's look, he leaves the suite to follow...

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, PADUA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank lies on the bed. There are clean bandages on his injuries.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The television drones on the wall: an Italian reality show. A WOMAN holds her hands over her eyes. The HOST taunts her:

INT. TERRACE FLAT, PADUA - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERCUT: Domenico - in his terrace flat. He wears a T- shirt and holds a glass of wine. Loud Italian pop music plays in the background.
</DIRECTION>
<DOMENICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well it's official Mr. Taylor. You're not mad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMENICO>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a relief.

</FRANK>
<DOMENICO>
	<DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I wish.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Never let them cuddle, Mr. Taylor. One cuddle and it all turns to merda. Good night. If you need anything, you have my number.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMENICO>
<DIRECTION>
Frank hangs up, shaking his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the restful silence he hears a DISTANT BANG. A gunshot? A door slam? Nervous, he gets up and goes to the door...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank looks right and left. The corridor is empty and silent, lit by strip lights set on low.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just as he's about to close the door again, Frank notices that there is a label stuck there with his name on it, just above the room number.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He struggles with the label for a few seconds, tearing it off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sticks the label on the door to an empty room opposite.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank goes to the sink and splashes water on his face. Stares at himself for several moments, as he did in the bathroom at the Danieli. He's lost in thought.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He hears the clang of a metal pushcart being wheeled along. Some footsteps approach. There are voices speaking an unfamiliar language, maybe Russian...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Russian?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank scrambles for his clothes. He fishes out Domenico's phone number from a pocket and races to the phone. Then freezes, listening:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The footsteps move away slightly... there is the sound of a door opening. The door across the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seconds pass. The door is closed again. The footsteps move down the hall, slowly fading away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank punches in the policeman's number and grips the receiver. It rings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DOMENICO'S TERRACE FLAT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A saucepot simmers on the stove. The phone RINGS. Behind it is a WINDOW - pierced by one circular bullet hole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The music still plays.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As our gaze drifts downwards we see Domenico's bare feet, prone behind the kitchen island.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The phone RINGS and RINGS...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank is struggling into his clothes. Everything seems to stick and take forever.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He opens the door a crack and looks down the ward. Nothing. He moves along the passage, slipping into doorways and out of the light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He finds the elevator and jabs at the button.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The light shows it is approaching the floor. It stops. The doors open. Frank is about to enter it, when suddenly SOMEBODY STEPS OUT...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An ORDERLY exits and brushes past.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank breaths a sigh of relief and steps in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL ELEVATOR, PADUA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank presses the button for Receptione et Terre and waits an interminable four seconds for the doors to close.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly the elevator descends... and stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The doors open. A big MAN stands with his back to us, blocking the exit. Frank shrinks away, with nowhere to hide. The man turns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's a MALE NURSE, waiting to get into the lift. He stands aside to allow Frank to leave. Frank takes a step out...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and sees SCARFACE talking to the receptionist. Hurriedly, Frank reverses back into the elevator.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(to the Nurse)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wrong floor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Then, just before the doors close, Scarface turns... his eyes meet Frank's. He starts towards the elevator... but the doors shut first.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lift stops again. The doors open on the first tier of the subterranean car park.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank leaps off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UNDERGROUND CAR PARK, PADUA HOSPITAL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Limping and terrified, Frank jogs towards the ramp marked Uscita in the far corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An ENGINE ROAR splits the silence. The lights blind Frank in the darkness as the car careers towards him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He falls to his knees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car skids to a stop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door flies open. He squints. Sitting behind the wheel, calm and beautiful as ever, is CARA. He stares.
</DIRECTION>
<CARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you waiting for? Get in.

He climbs into the car. She turns to him as she pulls out.
</DIRECTION>
<CARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you miss me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARA>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A little.

He glances anxiously over her shoulder.

</FRANK>
<CARA>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARA>
<DIRECTION>
Cara drives toward the ramp. He looks at her.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<CARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's because I kissed you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARA>
<DIRECTION>
She stops the car and waits for the metal gate at the top of the ramp to open. It rises with a loud creaking to REVEAL...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BLACK CAR with two men inside. One of them steps out and ducks under the gate as it rises up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
While he's briefly silhouetted by the car's headlights we glimpse the outline of an AUTOMATIC WEAPON.
</DIRECTION>
<CARA>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARA>
<DIRECTION>
With remarkable sangfroid she cuts the engine and lets her car roll backwards, gliding silently and perfectly into a parking spot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They watch the BLACK CAR slowly descend the ramp. The Russian with the gun in his hand walks carefully alongside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank watches, holding his breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of another engine cuts through the silence. A pair of headlights come up from the level below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON THE CAR. The MALE NURSE from the elevator is driving up toward the exit ramp, toward the exit where the Russians are waiting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON THE GUNMAN slipping back into the shadows and readying his gun to fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FRANK sees what is about to happen. His face betrays his concern.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches for the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLICK. Cara presses the central door lock. Frank's door doesn't budge. He looks over at her.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(re: the Nurse)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That guy has nothing to do with this.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</CARA>
<DIRECTION>
Cara revs the car and pulls out fast, cutting off the Nurse's car. He leans on the horn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the top of the exit ramp, the metal parking gate is slowly being lowered.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She weaves around the black car, deliberately heading for the gunman. He opens fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BRRRRRAAAP!! Bullets spray wildly, ricocheting off the walls, shattering windshields... Frank covers his face as a side-window pops, showering him with glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The GUNMAN is forced to jump out of the way as Cara scrapes the side of her car along the wall. Sparks fly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The black car burns rubber as it U-turns to follow her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She guns it up the ramp towards the closing door.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's not enough room!

The fence whirs at head height and keeps lowering. The black car is closing in behind them.

</FRANK>
<CARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought Americans were optimists.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARA>
<DIRECTION>
At the last second he ducks instinctively and closes his eyes. The gate clips the top of Cara's car with a tremendous CLANG! Traps it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cara presses her foot all the way down on the accelerator. Smoke pours from the tires.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CRASH!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The black car RAMS them from behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Russian leans out the window and fires at the outlines of Cara and Frank's HEADS. Bullets shatter the back window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cara pushes Frank's head down. The sound of burning gears as the engine hits its limit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, scraping paint, Cara's car SPRINGS forward, jetting out onto the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fence drops further and shudders to a halt. The black car is trapped. The Russians can only watch as Cara speeds away.
</DIRECTION>

He's snoring. She pinches his nose closed...

He follows her past abandoned tricycles and very old men sitting on stone steps.

Cara walks up the stairs to a door on the landing. She opens it with a key.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PEARCE'S "SAFE HOUSE" - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is completely dark inside. The two of them maneuver in the darkness. The sound of a hand bumping against a wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally somebody finds the light switch and--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CARA holds a .38 Taurus PISTOL in front of her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank happens to be right in her line of sight. He flinches.

Cara starts to giggle. Frank starts to laugh too.
</DIRECTION>

INT. KITCHEN, PEARCE'S "SAFE HOUSE" - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The apartment appears as if it was leased, stocked and then never set foot in again. Brand new appliances that have never been used.
</DIRECTION>

Frank walks over to a flat screen TV and curiously peels off the protective clear film... He looks up and sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cara has her head inside the OVEN.

<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing?

Frank watches her walk over to the FUSE BOXES.

MINUTES LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank pokes through the cupboards. Stocked with fine olives, tins of expensive smoked fish, viands, stewed fruit from orchards in France.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He opens the icebox. Inside is frozen meat and fish. He pulls out one package of frozen orange steaks - it is labelled "BARRACUDA, CAUGHT ANTIGUA, 8/07".
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He goes Barracuda fishing?

Cara stands abruptly.

Cara looks after him... exasperated yet already sorry for being so blunt. She is about to say something when...

At last The Englishman arrives before the lower colonnade of the DOGE'S PALACE, the seat of medieval Venetian civic government. It is a wonder of Gothic architecture with spires piercing the blue sky.

He gazes up at it for a moment.

A silent caravan of three black SUV's - a strange sight in Venice - pull up in perimeter around the Bridge of Sighs and skids to a stop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ackerman and the others leap out, looking around. Then Ackerman sees it:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Englishman's CELL PHONE, sitting on the cobblestones.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They approach. Goyal kneels to pick it up with a plastic bag.

Frank lies asleep on the couch.

<DIRECTION>
Cara walks to the kitchen and retrieves the Tuscan Cookbook. Thinking herself unobserved, she opens it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A PAGE has been turned down. A recipe for LAMB.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cara pulls out her red, felt-tipped pen. She finds a sentence in the recipe with a single pen dot beside it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tapping her pen under letters on the page, Cara works out the code, memorizes the contents of the message and closes the book.

<DIRECTION>
Just as she raises her voice a door opens below them in the hall, and an old man comes out. He looks up at Cara.
</DIRECTION>
<OLD_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Signorina.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_MAN>

This is exactly what she did not want. But she controls her annoyance, nods in greeting and continues towards the front door.

Ackerman sips from his ten thousandth cup of espresso.
</DIRECTION>
<ACKERMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe it's because if he adores himself and spends every moment gratifying his desires, so then can she.

He looks around to see if the others like this theory.

Paging through the cookbook, Frank locates the page. He smiles in recognition at the familiar CODE pattern of red dots. He pulls out a PEN...

INT. BATHROOM, "SAFE HOUSE" - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank examines a sleek, tiny electric razor that resembles a lollipop. Turning it on, he applies it. Pleased, he keeps shaving.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Getting out of the shower, Frank enjoys the soft Frette towels.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MASTER BEDROOM, "SAFE HOUSE" - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the closets are dozens of flawless, custom-tailored suits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flipping through the rack like a discerning shopper, Frank arrives at a suit that catches his fancy. Elegant and simple.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE MIRROR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank struggles to close Alexander Pearce's pants around his lightly padded mid-section... a little too tight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank is irritated to discover he's not quite as trim as Pearce.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE BEDROOM FLOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank engages himself in a spontaneous program of CALISTHENICS. He struggles through a batch of push-ups, then sit ups.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE MIRROR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank flosses his teeth. Then he backs up, taking in his outfit. The lines of the suit highlight his frame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He likes what he sees.

INT. DEMIDOV'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Demidov is getting dressed. It's an elaborate ritual: carefully pressed pants, ironed shirt, starched collar, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His two BODYGUARDS stand nervously at attention, watching him.
</DIRECTION>
<DEMIDOV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When I was a young man, times were very hard. When an opportunity presented itself, you took it.

	I was twelve years old when Gregor asked me if I was ready for a man's job. He was the top chelovek in our housing block. So I said yes. He gave me a crowbar and told me to go bash in the skull of another boy who had stolen something from him.
	</DIALOGUE>

He points at his platinum cufflinks on a bedside table and snaps his fingers. Scarface hands them to him.

	Now it just so happened this boy was a friend of mine. I did not want to do this terrible thing. But when you come from the streets, you have no choice.

He carefully knots his tie in the mirror.

He turns and smiles at his THICK-NECKED bodyguard. He gestures toward the man's holstered pistol --

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have people like you to do these things for me...

	<DIALOGUE>
	Except that you don't!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEMIDOV>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Demidov pistol whips the man across the face!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blood explodes from THICK NECK's nose. He falls down to one knee, clutching his face in pain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scarface looks on in fear. Demidov calms himself almost as quickly as he lost his temper. He drops the gun on the carpet and steps back in disgust.
</DIRECTION>
<DEMIDOV>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you did your job properly, I wouldn't have to get my hands dirty, you piece of shit.

Heels clicking on the cobblestones, Cara strides quickly along the Palazzo Vendramin en route to the Cipriani. She checks her watch. Then walks faster.
</DIRECTION>

She passes a smallish transporto via cargo (supply boat) floating in the lagoon beside the Palazzo.

Cara approaches the poolside hotel restaurant.

From a second story SUITE of rooms, The ENGLISHMAN peers through the curtains. He sees Cara seat herself at a TABLE between the pool and the lagoon.

His eyes settle on the transporto. Workers step on and off, carrying fresh linens into the hotel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He leaves the window.

<DIRECTION>
INT. TRANSPORTO - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a small cabin on the deck.

Inside the cabin, Ackerman, Goyal, a videographer, a signals surveillance officer and a coordinating tactics officer huddle.

Ackerman stares out the tinted window.

ACKERMAN'S POV - he can just see Cara sitting at the table.

EXT. CIPRIANI HOTEL, POOLSIDE RESTAURANT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fanning herself with a newspaper, Cara discreetly evaluates the men in her sight lines. Venetian civic leaders chatting by the bar, tourists reading maps...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Over her sunglasses she catches sight of a pair of YOUNG LOVERS drunk in each other's grasp in the pool.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRANSPORTO - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Squinting, Ackerman evaluates his placements.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- A WAITER, idling at his bussing station, his eyes roaming the palazzo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- A VAPORETTO CAPTAIN, who quietly turns away requests for a ride into St. Marks Square, his finger to his ear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- An OLDER COUPLE sitting a few seats away from Cara.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And an AGENTE DI POLIZIA (police patrolman) loud and jovial, joking with passersby, while quietly checking his earpiece.

He speaks into the air.

The elegant man is FRANK.

</ACKERMAN>

Cara stares slack-jawed at Frank.

He has given himself a complete make-over. New haircut. Pearce's suit fits him well.

He looks terrific. Cara notices before quickly recovering her composure.

The UNDERCOVER WAITER now moves toward the table with a grim expression...

The THIN WAITER removes the platter. Cara looks down.

Spelled out in SALT and PEPPER on the plate is the following:

"MY VILLA. TONIGHT. 8PM."

Cara no sooner reads it than the Thin Waiter, who we now see is THE ENGLISHMAN...

The Undercover Waiter picks up speed, changing course slightly. WE SEE he's after The Englishman who is about to enter the restaurant kitchen...

Cara quietly picks up her bag and leaves the restaurant. She walks as fast as she can without being noticed toward the Palazzo Vendramin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the midst of his scuffle, Frank looks around and realizes she's gone.

The Undercover Waiter's earpiece falls out in the melee... Frank sees it and hesitates. Maybe this guy isn't Pearce.

Getting up from his seat in the cabin, Ackerman gestures for the captain of the transporto to leave the dock.

Cara says nothing. She just shoots Frank an angry glance and climbs onto A VAPORETTO (water taxi).

Frank runs to the edge of the water as it motors away.

Suddenly he feels the presence of somebody behind him. TWO of ACKERMAN'S MEN are right there.

They pin his arms forcefully.

He glances in the mirror periodically, suspicious.

EXT. BACK OF THE VILLA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The black boat slips underneath some moorings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A gloved hand tosses a grappling hook up to a beam ten feet overhead. It catches. The boat is tied off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Silently, a masked figure begins to climb from the boat up into the bottom floor of the villa in the semi- darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SURVEILLANCE OUTPOST IN CHURCH

ON THE MONITOR WE SEE

PEARCE'S ENTRY HALL. Cara unlocks the front door with a key and walks inside.

INT. ALEXANDER'S VILLA/VIDEO MONITORS - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>

TRACK from screen to screen as WE FOLLOW Cara moving through the deserted rooms.

Everything is cold and lifeless. Like a palace that has been turned into a museum.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHURCH - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
While everyone is focused on the monitors showing Cara's progress, Frank notices some movement in a monitor far off to one side...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It shows the lower floor of the house.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(points)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's that?

</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
They all turn to look. A male figure, his face masked, approaches the lens of the surveillance camera...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLINK! The FEED shuts off.

<DIRECTION>
Ackerman barks at a technician.
</DIRECTION>
<ACKERMAN>

Frank looks anxiously at Cara on the monitor climbing the stairs...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blink! She disappears from view as well. Everybody starts talking.

</ACKERMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Everybody in the Church stands stock still. Staring at the dark monitors. Listening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cara's footsteps click up the stairs and then slow...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They move tentatively across the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE HEAR A THUMP. A door or a heavy footstep?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cara's breathing gets louder. There's somebody else in the building.
</DIRECTION>
<CARA>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alexander?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARA>
<DIRECTION>
No response. Click, clack, click... She takes a few steps.

<DIRECTION>
ON FRANK -- concerned.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON ACKERMAN -- calm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ALEXANDER'S VILLA, PENTHOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cara stands in the center of the large room. She catches sight of her reflection in the large floor-to-ceiling window. There's a movement in the doorway behind her...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She spins around to face...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DEMIDOV. He and his two men have removed their masks.
</DIRECTION>
<DEMIDOV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry to disappoint you, my dear.

He steps toward her.

Cara doesn't reply.

EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

SNIPER'S POV - CARA has maneuvered close enough to the window that she is visible. As they approach, Demidov and his two men come into range as well.

ON FRANK'S FACE - he looks around at the cops desperately hoping somebody will do something. They all look to Ackerman.

<DIRECTION>
INT. ALEXANDER'S VILLA, PENTHOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Demidov circles Cara dangerously close.
</DIRECTION>
<DEMIDOV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not very polite of your boyfriend to keep you waiting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEMIDOV>
<CARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He loses track of time easily.

<DEMIDOV>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEMIDOV>
<DIRECTION>
A long silence. The tension grows. Then we hear...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LOUD SLAP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone in the room flinches.
</DIRECTION>
<DEMIDOV>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know... I have a feeling he is around here somewhere. And if he cares about you... if he wants to see your lovely face again... he should show up before it's too late.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEMIDOV>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER SLAP - MORE VICIOUS THAN THE FIRST. This time Cara cries out in pain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Goyal turns to Ackerman.
</DIRECTION>
<GOYAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOYAL>
<ACKERMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Demidov's right. He's here somewhere...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ACKERMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Another SLAP. Another scream.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jean Luc looks to his colleagues-- Jones, Quinn... then turns to Ackerman. Every one of them is about to burst.
</DIRECTION>
<JEAN_LUC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have to do something--
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEAN_LUC>
<ACKERMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have to wait.

<JEAN_LUC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes but--
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEAN_LUC>
<ACKERMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(harsh)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's my agent. She's my responsibility.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ACKERMAN>
<DIRECTION>
A muffled THUD. Cara groans and WE HEAR her body hit the floor. That wasn't a slap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Every cop in the room is clenching his weapon. Desperate for the order to move. To jump in and stop this.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are all looking to Ackerman to give the order.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the silence wears on, even Jones starts to waver. She speaks quietly to Ackerman.
</DIRECTION>
<JONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if he doesn't come?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONES>
<DIRECTION>
Ackerman doesn't respond.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lack of sound in the church is even more disturbing than before.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Goyal notices...
</DIRECTION>
<GOYAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's Taylor?
	</DIALOGUE>

SMASH CUT TO:

EXT. STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank runs for all he's worth. Panting for breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ALEXANDER'S VILLA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank bursts through the front door. Races to the steps without hesitating...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ALEXANDER'S VILLA, PENTHOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cara lies on her side at Demidov's feet. Blood trickles from the side of her mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her eyes are clouded with fear and pain as she views the room half-askew. Then they suddenly come into focus as she sees...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A figure walks into the room. FRANK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stand motionless in the doorway, surprisingly calm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Demidov turns.
</DIRECTION>
<DEMIDOV>
<DIRECTION>
(leans down to Cara)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good news. He loves you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEMIDOV>
<DIRECTION>
Demidov's men take Frank by either arm and roughly drag him forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cara lifts her head with an effort.
</DIRECTION>
<CARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not Alexander Pearce.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARA>
<DIRECTION>
Demidov ignores her and walks up to Frank.
</DIRECTION>
<DEMIDOV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, Mr. Pearce, I thought I was finished with this sort of thing. But in your case, I've been forced to make an exception.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEMIDOV>
<DIRECTION>
He holds out his hand and one of his THUGS gives him a PISTOL and a SILENCER.
</DIRECTION>
<CARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He is NOT Alexander Pearce!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARA>
<DIRECTION>
Demidov begins screwing the silencer onto the barrel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The thugs push Frank to his knees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But he's barely paying attention to them. His eyes are locked on Cara.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She meets his gaze. For a moment, it's as if nothing else in the world exists but the two of them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He may only be a hapless tourist, but he loves her. He's the one here, willing to give up his life to save hers.
</DIRECTION>
<CARA>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh Frank... I'm so sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARA>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing to be sorry for.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Demidov finishes attaching the silencer. He points the gun at the back of Frank's head.
</DIRECTION>
<DEMIDOV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good bye Mr. Pearce.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEMIDOV>
<DIRECTION>
At this moment, Cara fills her lungs and screams:
</DIRECTION>
<CARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ackerman!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARA>
<DIRECTION>
She bends her head toward her cleavage, yelling into the tiny microphone.
</DIRECTION>
<CARA>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (furious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ackerman!!
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Demidov is taken off guard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHURCH - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her scream echoes through the arched church.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ackerman gives the order.
</DIRECTION>
<ACKERMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ACKERMAN>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SNIPER'S POV - Demidov and his gun-wielding henchmen standing over Frank and Cara.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ALEXANDER'S VILLA, PENTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The huge, plate glass window shatters as the high powered bullet slams through it!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everything explodes in a mass of blood and glass. SCARFACE is blown off his feet. His body hits the ground next to Frank... his gun skitters across the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Demidov looks from the window to Cara with cold fury in his eyes-- she's the one who has called in the artillery. He raises his pistol toward her, point blank.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BANG! The gunshot takes him by surprise. He turns to see...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FRANK holds Scarface's smoking pistol in his hand. Demidov just has time to process the fact that Frank is the one who shot him before the life drains from his eyes and he topples...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Demidov's other bodyguard fires out the windows wildly and makes a run for it. Glass flies everywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank throws his body over Cara to protect her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A short and furious exchange of gunfire as the other plate glass windows explode. Wood splinters fill the air as furniture is torn apart. Finally...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the sniper's bullets finds its target and the BODYGUARD goes down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank remains on top of Cara, shielding her until long after everything has fallen silent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALEXANDER'S VILLA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ackerman and his team approach, guns drawn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Undercover agents converge as well, closing the perimeter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ALEXANDER'S VILLA, PENTHOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank and Cara sit in the middle of the room amongst a sea of broken glass. Just getting over the shock of being alive.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you all right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Cara nods. She looks at him for a long moment, then breaks out into a smile.
</DIRECTION>
<CARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I did well to choose you on the train...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARA>
<DIRECTION>
Frank's turn to smile. He looks around the room at the carnage.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't get to arrest Alexander Pearce...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<CARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He never showed up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARA>
<DIRECTION>
Frank slides closer to her. Gently, carefully, he slips his hands into Cara's cleavage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Surprised, Cara starts to pull back-- but he puts a finger to her lips.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She hesitates... looks at him questioningly. But she doesn't protest as his fingers move toward her bra...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and grasp the tiny MICROPHONE. With a sharp tug, he rips it free. He tosses it across the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he leans a little closer and whispers in her ear:
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(a British accent)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're wrong. I'm here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
She straightens up. Her heart skips a beat.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's me. I'm here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
She covers her mouth. Her eyes mist over with tears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She runs her fingers over his face with loving amazement. Like a blind person trying to recognize a familiar face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her mind reels...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then their lips meet. They kiss. And kiss. Like drinking from a fresh spring in the desert.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally she pulls away and looks at him.
</DIRECTION>
<CARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARA>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You said I'd told so many lies, you wouldn't believe me even if I did tell the truth... This was the only way to convince you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The truth is that I love you. All that matters is that you believe me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
She stares into his eyes for a beat. Finally looking at her without a trace of deception. She believes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They hear voices on the stairs below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank holds up a finger to her-- wait.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank crawls across the room and presses a hidden latch on a built-in bookshelf. It swings out of the way to reveal a hidden safe built into the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank removes the fitted floor boards. There is a sophisticated BIO-METRIC LOCK -- just like the one at the gate in the beginning of the movie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank places his finger on the spot and the lock clicks open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ALEXANDER'S VILLA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRACK WITH ACKERMAN up the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He leads the team into the PENTHOUSE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks around at the mess as the agents fan out.
</DIRECTION>

Cara leans on Frank's arm as she heads for the exit.
</DIRECTION>
<ACKERMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cara... I want the paramedics to make sure you're all right--

	No we won't. There's nothing to talk about. I don't work for you anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARA>
<DIRECTION>
She walks past him. For a moment Ackerman and Frank look at one another.
</DIRECTION>
<ACKERMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Taylor... you're free to go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ACKERMAN>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at Frank with a measure of begrudging respect.
</DIRECTION>

(American accent)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It seems you did, Mr. Ackerman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
With that, Frank steps out of the room. Ackerman's attention is distracted by--
</DIRECTION>
<GOYAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir... over here. Take a look at this!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOYAL>
<DIRECTION>
Goyal has found the safe. Ackerman comes over and looks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT CLOSE UP - the only thing in the safe is a single FLASH DRIVE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Goyal signals to one of the TECHS. He opens a laptop on the desk and they plug in the FLASH DRIVE to check the contents.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
While they are doing this, Ackerman bends to inspect the BIO-METRIC LOCK.
</DIRECTION>
<ACKERMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ACKERMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Jones looks on eagerly as numbers fill the screen.

<DIRECTION>
Goyal scans down to a total...

<GOYAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looks like 744 million.

<JONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's no mistake...

	</DIALOGUE>
</JONES>
<DIRECTION>
She slips it into her pocket, then turns to Ackerman.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ackerman has moved away. He's staring down at the ground -- from behind he looks like a man defeated.
</DIRECTION>
<JONES>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well John... with the funds recovered, I don't think there's going to be any appetite from our side to continue this investigation.

Ackerman's shoulders are slumped, staring at Demidov's dead body on the ground. Jones puts a hand on his back, consoling him.

	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
<ACKERMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh but I did get my man, Ms. Jones.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ACKERMAN>
<DIRECTION>
She realizes; he was after Demidov all along.

Ackerman nods to Goyal, a twinkle in his eye.

Quinn is taken completely off guard. Before he can move, Goyal and another agent have placed him in handcuffs.
</DIRECTION>
<ACKERMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (to Quinn)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? You thought I didn't know? You were unwittingly quite helpful; without you Mr. Demidov might have escaped justice.

He turns to Jones with a smile.

	After all, Demidov wasn't a target of this investigation, was he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ACKERMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Ackerman walks over to the window as Quinn is led away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ACKERMAN'S POV - Cara and Frank walk toward the canal in the street below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A WATER TAXI approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<JONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's something I don't understand... how did Pearce manage to get here and open that safe without anybody noticing? And where did he go?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONES>
<DIRECTION>
Ackerman stands at the window with his hands behind his back. For the briefest of moments, Frank looks back up at him and their eyes connect.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank gives him a little smile. Cara takes his arm to climb onto the boat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON ACKERMAN: his eyes narrow. He knows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment he doesn't move. Then, in spite of himself, a small smile creeps over his face too.
</DIRECTION>
<ACKERMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because Pearce was cleverer than all of us.
	</DIALOGUE>

CUT TO:

<DIRECTION>
EXT. WATER TAXI - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cara and Frank step on board.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The DRIVER starts the engine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns to REVEAL... that he is the "ENGLISHMAN" we've seen throughout the movie. He and Frank look at one another for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_ENGLISHMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	$20 million dollars worth of surgery and that's the face you chose?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_ENGLISHMAN>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(English accent)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's good to see you too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
They embrace warmly. Cara is in disbelief, realizing just how completely Frank/Alexander has planned things out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She casts one last glance backwards.
</DIRECTION>
<CARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You really think they'll just give up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARA>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Americans have their money. I left it all for them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<CARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about Demidov's money?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARA>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have to save something for your pension.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
The Englishman opens the door to the cabin for them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bottle of Crystal Champagne and two glasses are set out for them. Frank leads Cara in and offers her a glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Instead, she slips into his arms and presses against him. They begin to kiss...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA STAYS discreetly behind as they pull away from us, the water taxi swinging out into the Grand Canal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As it recedes from view, the vaporetto's tail lamps shimmer and blend into the beautiful lights of Venice... a city for lovers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
