<DIRECTION>
It's the Cleveland Indians' conference room. Three men are seated around the table; CHARLIE DONOVAN. the manager, PHIL BUTLER, public relations head, JERRY SIMMONS, operations director and LYLE MATTHEWS director of player personnel Donovan taps his pencil impatiently, obviously waiting for somebody.
</DIRECTION>
<DONOVAN>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Thirty minutes late. Think she'll show?

</MATTHEWS>
<DONOVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She didn't last week. She was having a guava facial.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONOVAN>
<DIRECTION>
As Butler tries to figure out what a guava facial is, the conference room doors swing open and a muscular MALE SECRETARY- BODYGUARD enters, clearing the way for MRS. RACHEL PHELPS, a flashy, striking woman in her early forties. Despite the designer clothes she favors, there is the hint of something less refined about her. She carries a Pekinese dog, CHA-CHA on her left hip.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good morning, gentlemen. Welcome to another season of Indians' baseball.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
The men applaud, but their hearts are barely in it. The Secretary-Bodyguard pulls out a chair at the head of the table and Rachel sits.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know that it may not seem the same without Donald here this year, but I promise you by the end of the season this team will have made history.

Several eyes roll up around the room.

<RACHEL>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Unfortunately there are some in the press who feel that...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(reading from the page)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"the ex-showgirl wife of Donald Phelps has no business being the owner of a major league baseball team."
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
Rachel crumbles the paper and throws it away.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Obviously, Donald didn't feel that way or he wouldn't have left the team to me. And I was more than showgirl. I was a dancer. Now, I know some of you have doubts about my ability to run this franchise. God help you if I ever find out about it.
	</DIALOGUE>

This causes a few nervous glances in the room.

	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
Donovan, Butler and Simmons pour over the list.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could sit here and tell you what a great year we're gonna have, but the facts are we lost the two best players we had to free agency. We haven't won a pennant in 30 years. We haven't even finished in the first division for 15. Obviously it's time to make some changes. What do ya think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<SIMMONS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never heard of half these guys. And the ones I do know are way past their prime.

	It's time to shake things up, Charlie. Clear the board and start over.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DONOVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it's not the best material I've ever had to work with, but I'll do my best to see we move up a notch this year.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONOVAN>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know you will, Charlie. That's why I'm movin' you up to General Manager. Congratulations.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
Rachel sticks out her hand. Donovan shakes it somewhat feebly, bewildered by this whole development.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, that should do it for today. Thank you, gentlemen. Let's get to work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>

With that, Rachel gets up and breezes out of the room with her entourage, leaving Donovan and the others dumbfounded.

INT. DONOVAN'S NEW OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Donovan, carrying a boxful of belongings under each arm, pushes open the door of his new office and walks inside. The basic outfitting is masculine enough, but the room is full of feminine little accents; flowers in vases, porcelain desk accessories etc. Donovan is slightly overwhelmed. Suddenly, there's a voice at the door.

<DONOVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm glad you called me in. I'm still unclear on a couple things

</DONOVAN>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, really? Like what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>

	Well, if I'm the G.M., who's gonna be the Manager?

</DONOVAN>
<RACHEL>

	I was thinking of Lou Brown.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DONOVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lou Brown?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONOVAN>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's managed the Toledo Mud Hens of the International League for the last 30 years.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
This is hardly an impressive credential to Donovan.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think he'll fit right in with our team concept.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DONOVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What exactly is our team concept?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONOVAN>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what I wanted to talk to you about. I want to put together a team that will help us relocate to Miami.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DONOVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(referring to the roster)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some of these guys are furniture movers?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONOVAN>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm serious about this, Charlie. It's no secret I've never liked Cleveland much. The weather's lousy, downtown is a pit, the stadium's falling apart, and we can't draw dick. Another couple of years of this and I'm gonna have to start feeding Cha-Cha dog food.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
Rachel bends down to give her dog, Cha-Cha, a little love pat, while Donovan tries to contain his disgust.
</DIRECTION>
<DONOVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mrs. Phelps, you can't just up and move a team on a whim...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONOVAN>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's hardly a whim. Miami's offered to build us a new stadium -- 62,000 capacity, 45 V.I.P. boxes, and no rent for the first million at the gate. Plus a 12 million dollar media guarantee; 45 percent of the concession gross, all of the parking and they pick up the stadium operations costs. No other franchise in baseball can match that deal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DONOVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Even so, the League'll never let us leave Cleveland. We got a lease with the city.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONOVAN>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The lease says we have the right to move if our attendance falls below 800,000 for the year.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pushing across a copy of the lease)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Paragraph 40, line 17.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
Donovan looks at it, the paragraph highlighted in yellow.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If we play bad enough, we should be able to come in under that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DONOVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you saying? You want us to lose?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONOVAN>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, we've been losing. What I want us to do is finish dead last.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
Donovan is stunned. He casts around helplessly for some response.
</DIRECTION>
<DONOVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mister Phelps would never have approved of this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONOVAN>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He knew it had to be done. He just didn't have the courage to do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(with veiled menace)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hopefully, you will come to see the wisdom of it.
	</DIALOGUE>

(pause)
</DIRECTION>

	If this team lives up to its potential, we could have the worst record in all baseball.

On a stretch of deserted Mexican highway. OVER we hear a telephone RING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOTEL ROOM - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is a total mess. The back door is off its hinges and a few chickens have wandered in. As they peck around the debris, we PAN the room, taking in beer cans, food wrappers and finally a trail of hastily discarded clothes, both male and female.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We reach the bed and find our hero, JAKE TAYLOR, 35, and with a couple days growth of stubble, passed out on his face. Sprawled across him asleep is a MEXICAN WOMAN in her late twenties. She's not great looking, but at least she's overweight. Taylor's hand fumbles to the RINGING telephone.
</DIRECTION>
<TAYLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeh.
	</DIALOGUE>

It's Charlie Donovan calling from his office in Cleveland. We CUT BACK AND FORTH between the two as we will in subsequent phone scenes.

Taylor struggles to get a look up at the girl on top of him.

	<DIALOGUE>
	By the way, you were with me last night. Who's this girl on top of me?

Donovan is baffled by this whole line of conversation.
</DIRECTION>
<TAYLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tolbert? Tolbert? Screw it.

Taylor hangs up, leaving Donovan staring into his phone. Taylor looks up to see TOLBERT standing in the doorway.

BROWN, PEPPER, TEMPLE AND DONOVAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
back at the field, supervising the arrival of more players.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The first is a tall, muscular Latin, PEDRO CERRANO, dressed in black from head to toe. He arrives on foot, carrying a black suitcase and pulling a black bat case on wheels. He looks like a gunfighter coming into Dodge.
</DIRECTION>
<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's that?

</BROWN>
<DONOVAN>

BLACK AND TAN ROLLS-ROYCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
pulling into the parking lot. Out steps RODGER DORN, high- priced third baseman. Brown eyes him with vague disapproval.
</DIRECTION>
<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thought you didn't have any high- priced talent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROWN>
<DONOVAN>
<DIRECTION>
(sheepish)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I forgot about Dorn, 'cause he's only high-priced. Got him as a free agent three years ago.

</DONOVAN>
<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Still hits the ball pretty well, doesn't he?

</BROWN>
<DONOVAN>

WILLIE HAYES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
a 22-year-old black, pulling up in a '72 VW Beetle which he's got a Cadillac grille on. He steps out in his shades and sharkskin suit.
</DIRECTION>
<DONOVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't recognize this guy.

Hayes strolls up and introduces himself.

<DIRECTION>
A motorcycle pulls to a stop in the lot, diverting everyone's attention from Hayes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Off steps Ricky Vaughn, a hefty bag over his shoulder. He's still sporting his radical do.

<PEPPER>

Donovan is speechless. Brown breaks into a small smile. Yes, sir, this is his kinda team.

INT. PLAYERS' BARRACKS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Taylor is putting his stuff away in a locker. Vaughn enters the barracks and immediately draws the attention of Dorn.
</DIRECTION>
<DORN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, what do we have here? Guy looks like a fuckin' toilet brush. Hey, T.B., I love your pony tail. And the earring's cute too. Where's the matching bracelet?

</DORN>
<DIRECTION>
Vaughn whips a hard glance at Dorn, but keeps on walking, making his way along the bunks looking for his assigned bed. It's the one above Taylor. Vaughn unloads his duffel bag in silence.

INT. LOCKER ROOM - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The players are dressing out in their uniforms for the first day of practice. Vaughn goes in his locker and finds that a slit has been cut in the back of his cap to accommodate his pigtail. Suppressed laughs are heard from several corners of the locker room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CLUBHOUSE - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brown is addressing his troops before the first workout.
</DIRECTION>
<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Welcome to Spring Training, gentlemen. Most managers tell you at this time that all the jobs are open, that nobody's a lock at any position, and that talent isn't everything. They'd rather see desire and discipline in a player. Then they tell you that most of all they want you to have fun out there, even though they're gonna work your ass off on fundamentals and condition you till you drop. The difference between me and those other managers is...

EXT. PRACTICE FIELD PARKING LOT - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hayes' cot is sitting in the lot, just outside the fence, his suitcase set down next to it. Hayes is still asleep, dew on his forehead. Wakened by the noise of activity on the field, he sits up with a start.
</DIRECTION>
<HAYES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit, I been cut already?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAYES>
<DIRECTION>
THE PRACTICE FIELD

We pick up Taylor sprinting his ass off in a 100-yard time trial, staggering across the finish line 10 feet behind Cerrano.
</DIRECTION>
<PEPPER>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	11.9 Taylor. Not bad if you'd fallen down.

As Taylor tries to catch his breath, Dorn and a relief pitcher named Gant approach the starting line for the next trial.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DORN AND GENTRY AGAIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Temple brings them to their marks and blows his whistle. Dorn and Gentry take off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Hayes, in his pajamas and bare feet comes streaking toward the starting line in hot pursuit. Dorn and Gentry a good 10-yard lead, but Hayes is coming like a bullet. We go to SLOW MOTION as Hayes draws even at the 80-yard mark and blasts on by to win by five. This kid is fast. Brown and Pepper give each other the "Who was that Masked Man" look.
</DIRECTION>
<BROWN>

EXT. THE PRACTICE FIELD - LONG SHOT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The players are spread out on the field doing calisthenics, counting off in unison.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TAYLOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
struggling through a series of pushups. He glances over in disbelief at Vaughn and Cerrano, who are doing them like pistons in competition with each other. Cerrano even starts doing them one-handed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hayes isn't doing them at all; merely pulling his head up and down while leaving his body on the ground.

EXT. THE BATTING CAGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Taylor is crouched behind the plate, warming up his arm. Catching pitches and throwing them half-speed down to second. Brown drifts over.
</DIRECTION>
<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How the knees holdin' up, Jake?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROWN>
<TAYLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great. Never been better.

<BROWN>

	Mobility's good? No problem gettin' off the throw to second?

</BROWN>
<TAYLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No problem.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAYLOR>
<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need a catcher, Jake. Somebody who can keep this team together on the field. You were a helluva player when you were sound, but around the league they think you can't take the pounding anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROWN>
<TAYLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Around the league they're wrong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAYLOR>
<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm gonna have to put you to the test, ya know. So, I want the absolute truth here. Are you 100 percent?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROWN>
<TAYLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeh. Would I bullshit about somethin' like that?

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You better if you wanna make this team.

Taylor smiles and fires one full-speed down to second. It bounces two feet in front of the bag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BATTING CAGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brown is watching batting practice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hayes steps into the cage and begins a preparatory ritual worthy of Babe Ruth -- rubbing dirt on his hands, stretching, knocking dirt off his spikes, twirling the bat, etc. A real slugger's routine.
</DIRECTION>
<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, Hayes, this isn't the All Star Game. Get up to the damn plate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROWN>
<DIRECTION>
Hayes gets in and takes his stance. On the first pitch, he takes a mighty cut and hits a pop-fly to the pitcher's mound. We take QUICK CUTS of the next three pitches. Hayes takes prodigious swings at all of them, producing three more pop- ups, none out of the infield. Brown calls a halt.
</DIRECTION>
<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you may run like Mays, but you hit like shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROWN>
<HAYES>

(aside)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For what? Running back to the dugout?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PEPPER>
<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You gotta stop swingin' for the fences though, Hayes. All you're gonna do is give yourself a hernia. With your speed you should be hittin' the ball on the ground, leggin' 'em out. Every time I see you hit one in the air, you owe me twenty pushups.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROWN>
<HAYES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, no problem.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAYES>
<DIRECTION>
The next pitch comes in. Hayes swings and pops it up.
</DIRECTION>
<HAYES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAYES>
<DIRECTION>
As he gets down to do his twenty, Brown turns to Temple.

</DIRECTION>
<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, Vaughn, they tell us you're a pitcher. Let's see what you got.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROWN>
<DIRECTION>
Brown and Pepper stand behind Taylor for a better view. Vaughn goes into his wind-up and fires a screaming fast ball that Taylor has no chance to get out of his crouch to catch. The ball rockets an inch over Brown's head, and slams into the backstop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brown stands frozen a second, contemplating his brush with eternity, then turns to Pepper.
</DIRECTION>
<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DORN>
<BROWN>

Brown strikes an effeminate fielding position, like Betty Grable shying from a mouse. Dorn burns.

PEDRO CERRANO

Harris winds and throws a fair-to-middlin' curve ball. Cerrano swings and misses it a foot.

</BROWN>
<DIRECTION>
Dorn approaches Brown at the cage.

<DORN>

<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>

</BROWN>
<DORN>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those penalty sit-ups you want me to do? I got it right here in my contract that I don't have to do any calisthenics I don't feel are necessary. What do ya think of that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORN>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone around the batting cage has stopped what they're doing to see how Brown will react. Brown looks at the contract a second, then drops it on the ground, unzips his fly, and gives it a golden shower. On Dorn's stunned face, we...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:

DORN

Vaughn's hand freezes on his locker latch, afraid to open it now.
</DIRECTION>
<TAYLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry, they don't cut anybody the first day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAYLOR>
<DIRECTION>
Vaughn is still not so sure. He sits down on his locker stool and glances over toward STEVE HARRIS a starting pitcher, whose locker is adjacent. As Harris takes off his jersey we see three SPLOTCHES OF GREASY SUBSTANCES on his chest, just inside the button line.

TAYLOR AND CARRANO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Taylor is undressing, but his attention is diverted by Cerrano whose stall is right next to him. Cerrano has set up an altar in his locker. In front of his bats, which are lined up like sentinels, is a table covered with pictures of baseball players, figurines of saints, several lit candles and, in the middle, a primitive fetish doll with a cigar in its mouth.
</DIRECTION>

Cerrano has drawn some magic signs on his bats. He finishes an incantation and then lights the cigar on the fetish doll.

Cerrano pours some gin in a small cup and puts it next to the fetish doll. Harris has been listening to all this. Cerrano grabs a towel to head for the showers.

Cerrano closes his locker and goes off to the showers, leaving everyone to wonder just how bad.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MONTAGE SEQUENCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
compressing and detailing the progress of spring training. We see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A) Vaughn on the pitcher's mound. A tin replica of a batter has been set up at home plate and rope stretched across the plate to delineate the strike zone. Vaughn fires a pitch and hits the tin batter in the hip, leaving a dent in him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
B) Cerrano in the batting cage, flailing away in futility at several curve balls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
C) HAYES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
doing push-ups at night. He's the only one left on the field, except Temple, who supervises.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
D) TAYLOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
doing the "scramble" drill -- blocking down balls purposely thrown in the dirt, one after another. When it ends, he can hardly get to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
E) CERRANO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
waving a ten-foot BOA CONSTRICTOR in the sign of the cross in front of his locker before opening it. No red tag greets him. Hayes watches from a safe distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
F) VAUGHN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
holding a mirror under the vents on his locker door to get a peek inside to see if there's a red tag there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
G) DORN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
taking a hard ground ball off the chest. Brown applauds. Dorn is pissed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
H) VAUGHN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
throwing at the "ropes" again. The tin batter is dented in every conceivable place now. Vaughn whips in another fast ball. This one hits the tin man in the head, knocking it completely off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
I) TAYLOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
in an exhibition game, attempting to throw out a base stealer. Jake springs out of his crouch and fires down to second -- on a bounce. The ball skips into center field.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
J) HAYES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
also in an exhibition game, swinging at a pitch and popping it up behind the plate. He just drops in his tracks and starts to do push-ups as the catcher makes the catch behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
K) CERRANO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
flailing away again at a curve ball. This and the remaining shots are all in exhibition games.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
L) HAYES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
waving a ten-inch garter snake in front of his locker. Even at this size we can tell it scares the hell out of him, but it works its magic. No red tag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
M) VAUGHN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
with a runner on third, winding up and throwing a pitch four feet over Taylor's head. The run scores.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
N) HAYES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
attempting to steal second. He goes into a hell-bent-for- leather head first slide. Unfortunately, he comes up two feet short of the base. The second baseman, who's waiting for him with the ball, makes a motion for him to keep coming. Hayes flips him the bird.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
O) LOU BROWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
on the bench. He turns to Pepper with a look that says, "Can you believe this shit?"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
P) TAYLOR

Hayes reveals a pair of red and cut hands.

</HAYES>
<DIRECTION>
Taylor goes into the locker room. Hayes and Vaughn hang back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cerrano is already at his locker. He's got two snakes this time and some kind of voodoo head dress on. He sprays a patch of white paint on the locker door from a spray can, draws a symbol door. No tag. He kisses the snake, leaving some white paint on his lips, like a kid who's just had a glass of milk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Taylor, exhausted from the game, lifts his latch and peers inside. He's made it, too. Cerrano offers a hand. Taylor shakes it and breaks a weary smile.

	C'mon, Vaughn, let's show some nuts here. If they cut us, we'll just sign with the Yankees.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAYES>
<DIRECTION>
Hayes strides manfully to his locker and pulls it open. This doesn't tell him much, however, because he's got his eyes closed. He stands that way a beat ot two, then opens one eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seeing no tag, he turns and walks double-time out of the locker room, as if he had to get to the john.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He comes outside, turns a corner, and starts leaping around like a wild man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VAUGHN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
drawing strength from Hayes, walks resolutely to his locker and whips it open. There hanging from the top hook is the "red death." Vaughn stares at it expressionless, then slowly closes his locker.

Vaughn goes right in without knocking and leans on Brown's desk.
</DIRECTION>
<VAUGHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got news for you, Mr. Brown. You haven't heard the last of me. You think I'm shit now, but someday you'll be sorry you cut me. I'm gonna catch on somewhere else, and every time I pitch against you, I'm gonna stick it up your ass.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VAUGHN>
<BROWN>

	What's the matter, little lady? Can't you take a joke?

<DIRECTION>
Vaughn gives Dorn a look that indicates this isn't over. Lou Brown enters the room.
</DIRECTION>
<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I have your attention, please? I counted up your ballots for team captain and I think you chose the right guy. If you hadn't, I woulda told you he won anyway. Mr. C for the year -- Jake Taylor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROWN>
<DIRECTION>
The team breaks into applause and whistles as Taylor's name is announced. Dorn is the only one who seems unhappy about it. As Taylor accepts the congratulations of his teammates, he turns to Vaughn.
</DIRECTION>
<TAYLOR>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two down. Bottom of the ninth.

</TAYLOR>
<DIRECTION>
Taylor points to the left field stands. He imagines a pitch coming in, takes a mighty swing and admires the flight of the imaginary ball as it arches high in the mid-day sky, landing deep in the left field seats. Breaking into his home run trot, he circles the bases, slapping the third base coach's hand and exchanging low fives with his teamates as he reaches the plate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, his reverie is interrupted by the sound of applause. He turns and looks in the dugout, where Hayes and Vaughn are giving him a hand.

The glasses CLINK. Suddenly Taylor's attention fixes on something across the room -- a stunning young woman in her late twenties, LYNN WESTLAND. She's having dinner with a DATE in a three-piece suit.

Hayes and Vaughn follow Taylor's eyes to the woman.

Hayes looks down at his shoe. It's not untied. He notices too late that the PITCHER is throwing over to pick him off.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Brewster, quick move to first...
	</DIALOGUE>

Hayes dives back for the bag, but never gets there; his face smashing up against the First Baseman's glove, which is already holding the ball.
</DIRECTION>
<DOYLE>

(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He got him. Hayes is picked off.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, so much for that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOYLE>
<DIRECTION>
Doyle takes a long pull on his Coke and we GO INTO A MONTAGE depicting the Indians' progressive disintegration in this game. We see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A) THREE FIELDERS converging on a short pop fly into left field. They all collide and go down in a heap as the ball drops untouched.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
B) DORN playing a grounder off his hip. He fumbles it, picks it up, fumbles it again. No play.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
C) TAYLOR crouched behind the plate, but up off his haunches, ready to throw. We hear the voice of his thoughts.
</DIRECTION>
<TAYLOR_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guy's goin'. Gotta be goin'... get the throw up. Don't bounce the damn ball.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAYLOR_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The runner on first takes off as the pitch comes in. Taylor catches the ball and fires down to second. The ball sails three feet over the second baseman's head and on into center field. Taylor stands there, disgusted.
</DIRECTION>
<TAYLOR_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice throw, dickhead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAYLOR_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
D) CERRANO striking out on a curve ball. He bawls his bat out on the way to the dugout.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
E) THE THREE FIELDERS we saw before, converging on another pop fly into short left. This time all three dive off at the last instant to avoid a collision. Once again the ball drops untouched.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
END MONTAGE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SCOREBOARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It shows Yankees 4, Indians 0 after five innings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DOYLE UP IN THE BOOTH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There are two empty Coca-Cola cups near the mike. He's working on a third.
</DIRECTION>
<DOYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Top of the sixth. Rookie sensation, Ricky Vaughn, on to pitch now. You can close the book on Winters...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOYLE>
<DIRECTION>
Vaughn stands on the mound rubbing up the baseball with the same intensity we saw in the locker room.
</DIRECTION>
<TAYLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Easy does it, Ricky. We're only four down. We're still in this thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAYLOR>
<PEPPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry if you're off the plate on a few pitches. Doesn't hurt to put the fear of God in a hitter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PEPPER>
<DIRECTION>
Vaughn nods and continues to grind the ball as Pepper and Taylor leave. The Yankee Hitter steps in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vaughn winds and fires a screamer. Taylor has to leap high to come down with it.
</DIRECTION>
<DOYLE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First pitch is a little high...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOYLE>
<DIRECTION>
The Yankee Hitter is slightly unnerved by this pitch.
</DIRECTION>
<YANKEE_HITTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This guy kinda wild?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YANKEE_HITTER>
<TAYLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I figure you got a 30% chance to survive this at bat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAYLOR>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER PITCH to the Yankee hitter. It's outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DOYLE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ball four.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOYLE>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER PITCH to a SECOND YANKEE HITTER. It's low.
</DIRECTION>
<DOYLE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ball eight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOYLE>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER PITCH to a THIRD YANKEE HITTER. He has to jump over it.
</DIRECTION>
<DOYLE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Low, and Vaughn has walked the bases loaded on twelve straight pitches. By the laws of probability, you'd think one of those coulda drifted over the plate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOYLE>
<DIRECTION>
THE BLEACHER BAND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby gives the downbeat and, in honor of Vaughn, the three men stand to pound out a version of "Wild Thing" on the tom- toms. Bobby does the vocal.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wild thing, You make my heart sing, You walk everything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Pepper has reached the mound...
</DIRECTION>
<PEPPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay kid. I think we got 'em scared enough now. Time to get a few of 'em out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PEPPER>
<DIRECTION>
Vaughn nods. He's plenty upset with himself.
</DIRECTION>
<PEPPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just relax, and keep the arm up on top. Gotta throw strikes. No place at the inn for this guy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PEPPER>
<DIRECTION>
He gives Vaughn a pat on the butt, and goes back to the dugout.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Yankee hitter, HAYWOOD, stands in. He's the first baseman who tagged Hayes out.
</DIRECTION>
<HAYWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Taylor, what you doin' back up here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAYWOOD>
<TAYLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Couldn't cut it in the Mexican League.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAYLOR>
<DIRECTION>
Vaughn, determined to throw a strike, winds and delivers. The ball is a perfect strike, right down the middle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Haywood crushes it to deep left field. Vaughn drops his head, not even bothering to look.
</DIRECTION>
<VAUGHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, shit...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VAUGHN>
<DIRECTION>
The ball lands in the second deck; a grand slam home run.
</DIRECTION>
<PEPPER>
<DIRECTION>
(to Brown)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looked like a strike anyway. You want me to go get him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PEPPER>
<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, let's see how he reacts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROWN>
<DIRECTION>
Vaughn paces around on the mound, rubbing up the ball. The next hitter, COLEMAN, steps in. Vaughn gets up on the rubber, his face set. He winds up and fires one right into Coleman's back. Coleman goes down in a hurry.
</DIRECTION>
<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Interesting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROWN>
<PEPPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At least he hit what he was aimin' at.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PEPPER>
<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you can go get him now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROWN>
<DIRECTION>
Both benches are up on the dugout steps ready to come out. The only thing holding them back is that Coleman is being tended to by the trainer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The home plate umpire thumbs Vaughn out of the game. Vaughn comes down to protest, but Pepper quickly grabs him and hurries him off the field.
</DIRECTION>
<PEPPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, kid. As soon as Coleman gets up, he's gonna be lookin' for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PEPPER>
<DIRECTION>
Coleman finally gets to his feet, still a little shaken. He looks around for Vaughn, but he's already disappeared into the dugout. Coleman walks down to first under his own power.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brown signals for a new pitcher and the players on both sides begin to return to the benches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VAUGHN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
walking alone down the tunnel to the locker room. He angrily knocks one of the overhead light bulbs out with his glove.

DOYLE IN THE PRESS BOX - LATER THAT NIGHT

He now has five empty cups next to the mike, plus a near- empty bottle of Jack Daniel's.

	If you wanted to send a message, it shoulda been to Haywood. He hit the damn homer. Coleman was just picking his nose in the on-deck circle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAYLOR>
<DIRECTION>
Vaughn nods slowly.
</DIRECTION>
<TAYLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forget the other stuff. It coulda happened to anybody. Besides, Haywood didn't hit it that good. That ball wouldn't have been out of a lotta parks.

We GO TO the door to find ARLENE standing with two friends, RENE and VICKI. ARLENE is a looker alright, 27, and seriously built. She cases the room, spies Dorn and comes over to his table.

<ARLENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't remember you makin' any date.

<DORN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Since when do I have to make a date? Who's been showin' you this town the last three years?
	</DIALOGUE>

<ARLENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ancient history, Rodger. I gotta look out for myself now. I don't have to be a slave to no .235 hitter.

ARLENE pulls away and heads for the jukebox as Dorn seethes. She punches a button and we hear X's version of "WILD THING."

ARLENE sashays right up to Vaughn in time with the music.

<ARLENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wild Thing, you make my heart sing.

We PICK UP Taylor in his seat, glasses on, reading something by the light of a flashlight rigged up to the back of his seat. We MOVE to reveal it -- the Classics Illustrated comic book of "Moby Dick."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hayes wanders by, an air-sick bag hanging around his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<HAYES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Moby Dick?" What is that?

</HAYES>
<TAYLOR>

EXT. CLEVELAND LIBRARY - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Taylor sits in his car, across the street from the employee entrance of the library. He scrunches down a bit as Lynn comes out of the building and heads for her car. She gets in and we...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SERIES OF SHOTS OF LYNN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
driving through the city with Taylor following at a discrete distance. Finally, Lynn pulls up outside an expensive-looking townhouse. Taylor pulls up further down the street and watches her go inside, debating whether to go in after her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CLEVELAND BAR - EARLY EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Taylor's having a beer, still trying to decide whether to go see her or not.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TAYLOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
pulling up outside the townhouse he saw Lynn go into. He goes up the stairs and knocks on the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lynn answers, looking more dressed up than when she left the library. She's surprised to see Taylor.
</DIRECTION>
<TAYLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Lynn, I'm sorry I followed you home but I wanna...

Before Lynn can answer, Tom appears at the door.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's there, love?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(spying Taylor)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Mr. Taylor, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pointedly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I remember you from the restaurant. Lynn's told me a lot about you. Why don't you come in for a while?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<TAYLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nah, that's o.k., I got some things to do...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAYLOR>
<LYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeh, he's gotta be goin'...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYNN>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, really, come on in for a drink.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
Before Taylor can beg off further, Tom ushers him inside and closes the door. In the room are two other couples: ARTHUR HOLLOWAY, a senior partner in Tom's firm and his wife CLAIRE, and BRENT BOWDEN, another lawyer in the firm and a contemporary of Tom's. His wife is JANICE. This is a very upscale group.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me, everybody, this is Jake Taylor.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(making the intros)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jake, Arthur and Claire Holloway Brent and Janice Bowden. Jake is a professional baseball player.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
Polite nods from the group, except for Janice, who seems somewhat intrigued.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, Jake, what brings you here this evening?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<TAYLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I, ah, just had a couple books I wanted to discuss with Lynn. I thought this was her place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAYLOR>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it soon will be.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<TAYLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeh, I heard you guys were engaged. Congratulations.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAYLOR>
<DIRECTION>
Taylor sticks out his hand. Tom's not sure whether Taylor's putting him on or not. He shakes anyway.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you. What can I get you to drink?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<TAYLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Beer'll be fine.

Tom goes off to get the beer.

<DIRECTION>
(handing Jake his beer)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're last right now, but hopefully moving up, eh, Jake?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
Tom clinks his glass with Jake's beer, the slight condescension in his manner not lost on Taylor. Lynn is uncomfortable with this whole situation. Janice moves a bit closer to Taylor. It's obvious she finds him attractive.
</DIRECTION>
<JANICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm told that baseball players make very good salaries these days.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANICE>
<TAYLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That depends on how good they are, I guess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAYLOR>
<JANICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How good are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANICE>
<DIRECTION>
Lynn is irritated by Janice's directness.
</DIRECTION>
<TAYLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I make the League minimum.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAYLOR>
<DIRECTION>
Tom and the others react as if Taylor's just announced a death in the family.
</DIRECTION>
<LYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was one of the best in baseball until he had problems with his knees.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYNN>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone is somewhat surprised by Lynn's quick defense of Taylor, including Lynn herself.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you going to do when your career ends? I mean you can't play baseball forever, can you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<TAYLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Somethin'll come up.

</TAYLOR>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>

	Oh really. In what event?

</JACK>
<TAYLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Swimming. Maybe the two hundred meter Individual Medley. I figure it oughta be big by then.

Jack just nods. He never heard of it.

<BRENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got the girl picked out?

</BRENT>
<TAYLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>

Lynn's eyes drop to the floor.

</DIRECTION>
<TAYLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I gotta be goin'. Nice to have met you all.

Taylor exchanges a quick glance with Lynn and heads for the door.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me walk you out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
Tom accompanies Taylor to the door, out of earshot of the others.
</DIRECTION>
<TAYLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks for the beer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAYLOR>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't mention it.

</TAYLOR>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeh, well, I just wanted Lynn to know what she would've had ahead of her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>

Tom sticks out his hand. The two men shake to keep up appearances for their onlookers across the room.

<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay away from her.

INT. VAUGHN'S ROOM - DAY

Vaughn looks somewhat apprehensively at Hayes.

INT. LOU BROWN'S OFFICE - DAY

Brown is lost in thought at his desk. Vaughn appears at the door like a boy expecting a spanking.
</DIRECTION>
<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon in, Rick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROWN>
<DIRECTION>
Vaughn comes in and takes a seat. He's worried.
</DIRECTION>
<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rick, I'm not gonna beat around the bush here. You got a great arm, one of the best I've ever seen, but your control hasn't come around like we hoped it would.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROWN>
<DIRECTION>
Vaughn nods contritely.
</DIRECTION>
<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, there are a lotta pitchers that started out wild and, after workin' it out in the minors, for a while, went on to great careers.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take Sandy Koufax there...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROWN>

Vaughn looks at the picture on the wall. He squints slightly. Brown notices it.
</DIRECTION>
<VAUGHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about Koufax?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VAUGHN>
<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never mind Koufax.

</BROWN>
<DIRECTION>
Brown quickly prints some big letters on a legal pad and goes to stand about fifteen feet from Vaughn.
</DIRECTION>
<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Read these letters, starting at the top.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROWN>
<DIRECTION>
Vaughn balks a second and then concentrates on the pad, squinting. Unsettled, he squints harder. He even tries closing one eye.
</DIRECTION>
<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't read it, can you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROWN>
<DIRECTION>
Vaughn shakes his head no.

Taylor, Hayes, Vaughn and the others are dressing out for the game. Vaughn is wearing his glasses.

Meanwhile, Cerrano is sharpening a long knife at his locker.
</DIRECTION>
<VAUGHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VAUGHN>
<CERRANO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gin and cigarettes not enough for Jo- Buu. I still can no hit curva ball for sheet. I hafta make a sacrifice to him.

<TAYLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sacrifice? You mean like something living?

	Si. I kill unborn children.

</CERRANO>
<HARRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not while I'm here you're not. That's murder.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRIS>
<DIRECTION>
Cerrano pulls the unborn chicken out of his pocket -- a common store bought egg. Harris is a little embarrassed at his outburst.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cerrano touches the egg to his forehead, then places it on his altar. In one swift motion he slams the knife down on it, cutting it into two perfect halves. Taylor and the others are agape at a knife sharp enough to do this. As the yolk spreads out on the altar, Brown emerges from his office.
</DIRECTION>
<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, let's hit the field.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROWN>
<DIRECTION>
The locker room quickly empties, leaving one man behind -- Harris. He looks around to make sure everyone is gone, then tiptoes over to Cerrano's locker. Screwing up his courage, he picks up Jo-Buu's cup of gin.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's looking at ya, Jo-Buu.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRIS>
<DIRECTION>
He bolts it down, then backs into the middle of the room, waiting at the ready, as if half-expecting a bolt of lightning. When nothing happens, he gloats at the fetish doll in triumph.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HARRIS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
strutting out of the dugout, feeling like a million bucks. As he emerges onto the field, a Hitter in the batting cage swings and misses, the bat slipping out of his hands. Away it flies, whirling off down the third base line in a wide arc. It hits Harris in the back of the head and knocks him cold.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
VAUGHAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vaughn, wearing his new glasses, paces the mound nervously. He goes to the rosin bag, wipes his brow, shakes out his arm. Finally up on the rubber, he gets the sign from Taylor, goes to his stretch, checks the runner and fires to the plate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE OAKLAND BATTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
swings and hits a grounder between third and short. Dorn moves to his left, but the ball goes past his glove and into left field. There is some question as to whether Dorn really gave it a full effort.
</DIRECTION>
<DOYLE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bouncing ball, Dorn can't get to it, into left field, base hit. Clarke digging around second, he'll make it to third, and the A's have runners at the corners.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOYLE>
<DIRECTION>
Vaughn stomps around on the mound, obviously upset. He glares at Dorn a beat before getting back on the mound. Dorn's face is non-commital. Brown paces in the dugout.
</DIRECTION>
<PEPPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want me to go get him?

<DIRECTION>
The next Oakland hitter, steps in. Taylor flashes a sign. Vaughn comes to the stretch and delivers. High, ball one. The runner on first goes down to second without a throw, the pitch being too tough to handle.
</DIRECTION>
<DOYLE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Runner goes, high, Taylor has no play. The go-ahead and potential winning run is in scoring position.

Taylor walks out in front of the plate to throw the ball back to Vaughn.
</DIRECTION>
<TAYLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forget the runners, Ricky, get this guy at the plate.

</TAYLOR>
<DIRECTION>
Taylor goes back behind the dish. Vaughn gets up on the rubber. He winds and comes to the plate. Way high this time.

<DOYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	High ball two, and the crowd doesn't like that call one bit.

	This isn't the California Penal League, Vaughn. We're professionals here. We don't tank a play for personal reasons, so cut the crybaby shit. You've pitched a helluva game. You wanna finish it, don't ya?

</DIRECTION>
<TAYLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Helluva situation we got goin' here, huh, Rexman? Two on, two out, you're down by a run in the ninth. You got a chance to be a hero on national television, so whatever you do, don't blow it. They'll be callin' you a gutless choke artist all over America.

Rexman shoots Taylor a wicked glance.

Rexman is trying to ignore Taylor, but failing badly. Taylor flashes a sign to Vaughn. Vaughn goes into his windup.

Rexman, completely unnerved, takes a feeble swing and hits a high pop-up out in front of the plate.

	Uh oh, Rexie, I don't think that one's got the distance. Maybe if the wind comes up.

Immediately, 30 arms shoot up behind her in the Italian "up- yours" gesture. She turns around, but by then the players have quickly returned to normal positions.

	Over 162 games even tough guys get sprains, sore arms, muscle pulls...

Taylor begins kicking dirt on Wingo's shoes, ala Billy Martin. Wingo takes a dramatic hop, skip and jump and gives Taylor the heave-ho thumb just as Brown arrives. Wingo turns away.

Taylor breaks away and starts back to the dugout. Playing it to the hilt, he throws his glove and mask to the ground on the way.

Meanwhile, Brown is going jaw to jaw with Wingo, outraged at the call. Brown pulls a carrot out of his back pocket, and offers it to Wingo, who immediately thumbs him out.

Taylor comes up the stairs from the locker room, still in full uniform. He emerges onto the box level to see Lynn disappearing down the ramp toward the parking lot.

<DIRECTION>
LYNN

in the parking lot. As she goes to unlock her car, Taylor looks around hurriedly for some kind of vehicle to follow her in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He bangs on the bullpen gates and is admitted by the guard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside is the Bullpen car, a souped-up golf cart with a body shaped like a batting helmet. Taylor hops in and roars out after Lynn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CLEVELAND ATHLETIC CLUB - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lynn comes out of the dressing room into the pool area, deserted this time of night. She wears a racing suit, but lets her hair hang free. The pool glows like a sheet of emerald glass. She shakes down a beat, curls her toes around the coping, slowly bends at the waist, and then launches into a full-out racing dive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We watch as she swims a 100 yard individual medley; first the butterfly, then the backstroke, breaststroke and finally freestyle. We condense the time, of course, SHOOTING some underwater, some SLO-MO, as she knives through the water, her hair flowing behind her, an athlete alone with her medium. The SEQUENCE should convey not only the grace of her strokes and her athletic ability, but the fluid beauty of swimming, its synthesis of power and form.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she begins the freestyle leg, another body appears in the pool next to her. It's Jake, and he's racing her the final lap. She immediately responds to the challenge, digging harder, picking up her kick. They go neck and neck for 20 yards, but Lynn has one more gear and touches him by half a body length at the wall. Both are winded.
</DIRECTION>
<TAYLOR>

<DIRECTION>
Driving through the city on her way home. Lynn glances in the rear-view mirror and spots Taylor following her. She smiles to herself. Taylor, of course, thinks he's gone undetected.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We begin a SHORT SEQUENCE during which Lynn tries to lose Taylor in a chase through Cleveland, car vs. batting helmet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The logistics will have to be worked out in Cleveland, but suffice it to say, by the end of the chase she appears to have ditched him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LYNN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lynn comes up the stairs, unlocks the apartment door and steps inside. There's no particular urgency. She feels sure she's shaken Taylor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The apartment is full of packing boxes. Tired from the chase, Lynn drops her bag on a box and slumps down on the couch. It's obvious she's not all that happy to have lost Taylor. She goes to the window and looks down to the street for some sign of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seeing nothing, she turns away from the window disappointed, and starts back to the couch, when something stops her. It's Taylor, standing in the doorway.

It was a guy to serve you with a paternity suit.

	I was drownin', Lynn. The endorsements were dryin' up, my knees were goin', they were talkin' about sendin' me down. I was just trying to hold on to somethin', prove to myself I was still an All-Star. I don't care about that anymore. I know I don't have much time left in baseball. I'm just a guy trying to put his life back together. Thinkin' about you was the only thing that kept me goin' in Mexico.

Taylor's car pulls INTO FRAME. He gets out and goes up the steps. There's one light on in the apartment window. Taylor comes up to the door and knocks. Getting no answer, he pushes it open to find that the apartment is completely empty. Just bare hardwood floor. Taylor stands forlorn in the center of the room a beat, then walks on out, switching off the overhead light as he goes.

INT. THE SHEFFIELD ARMS - DAY

We pick up Taylor, Hayes and Vaughn coming into their dilapidated hotel room. Peeling walls and ceilings, rickety furniture, rusted bathroom fixtures. Taylor sprawls down on one of the cots. It collapses on the floor in a cloud of dust.

Vaughn is on the mound warming up.

<DOYLE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, Ricky Vaughn, roughed up in his only other appearance against the Yankees, will see what he can do with the Bronx Bombers this time. Vaughn, after a slow start, has come on lately and now leads the American League in strikeouts with 221.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOYLE>
<DIRECTION>
Vaughn finishes his warmups. As Taylor pumps the ball down to second, Vaughn hears a voice from the Yankee dug-out.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, jailbird!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Vaughn glances over and sees that one of the Yankees is dressed in a striped prison uniform. He also wears long earrings, high heels, and of course, glasses. Vaughn tries to ignore the guy, but his concentration is broken.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vaughn steps up on the rubber for his first pitch. He winds and fires. The Yankee LEADOFF HITTER rips a one-hopper to the wall in right center. Hayes runs it down and guns it back to the infield to hold the guy to a double. The convict whoops it up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vaughn gets back up on the rubber. As he comes to the stretch, he catches sight of the convict again. The guy is doing a pantomime, sneaking up to a car and picking the lock, much to the delight of his teammates. Vaughn throws his pitch in the dirt and all the way to the backstop. The runner on second goes to third.

<TAYLOR>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, Rick baby, settle down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAYLOR>
<DIRECTION>
Vaughn gets ready again. The convict finishes picking the lock and then is suddenly arrested. He puts his hands against the wall and spreads his legs for a weapons check, cracking up the whole bench. Vaughn is getting a little steamed. His next pitch is hammered into left for a single, scoring a run.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THREE SHOTS OF VAUGHN

SHOTS

of the THIRD HITTER lining a double down the right field line, the FOURTH HITTER a triple off the center field wall, and the FIFTH HITTER a single to right. The scoreboard now reads 4 to 0 Yankees. Taylor comes out to talk to Vaughn.
</DIRECTION>
<TAYLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the problem, Rick? You're throwin' basketballs up there. That guy in the dugout botherin' you?

	</DIALOGUE>
</TAYLOR>

Vaughn nods as Taylor trots back behind the plate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vaughn gets set again as his old nemesis, Haywood, steps into the batter's box. Haywood has a sly smile on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Vaughn comes to his stretch, the convict goes back into his act. He's in jail now, struggling against the bars. Finally he bends over and grabs his ankles, while one of his teammates humps up against him, pretending to bugger him. This sends the Yankee bench into hysterics.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vaughn has lost it now. He fires to the plate and Haywood creams another tape measure job into the upper deck. Hayes doesn't even bother to run back to the wall. He just watches it go. 6-0 Yankees.

But there's a lotta talent on this club, Charlie. The veterans are starting to play back to form and the rookies are developing faster than I thought. There's two or three potential all- stars in there. I think we're a first division team right now.

INT. DORN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suzanne Dorn is watching the 11 o'clock news. HAL CHARLES is holding forth.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Indians are spending the night in Detroit and will bus back to Cleveland in the morning. We're going to go back now to Ross Farmer who's standing by at the Hotel Stanley where the Indians are staying in Detroit. Ross?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>
The scene shifts to...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE LOBBY OF THE STANLEY HOTEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
where Ross Farmer stands, microphone in hand. Behind him several players can be seen partying in the bar.
</DIRECTION>
<FARMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Hal. As you can see, the Indians are in high spirits tonight, looking forward to their showdown with the Yankees. Who will start that game is still a matter of some conjecture.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FARMER>
<DIRECTION>
As Ross talks, Dorn walks INTO THE FRAME in the far background with his arm around a YOUNG LOVELY. They're nuzzling and hugging, unaware they're on camera, albeit in the background. Suzanne doesn't miss it though. She moves closer to the screen to get a better look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dorn and the Girl get in an elevator together, obviously going upstairs. As the elevator closes, Suzanne hits the off button. She sits there a second in shock, and then her face begins to harden.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TAYLOR'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Taylor and DARLA are undressing, preparatory to getting into bed. They are definitely no strangers to each other.
</DIRECTION>
<DARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You still got that black Corvette? The one that the sound system took up the whole trunk?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARLA>
<TAYLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I had to sell it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAYLOR>
<DARLA>

</TAYLOR>
<DARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's all right, you'll be gettin' a new one now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARLA>
<DIRECTION>
Darla is down to her bra and panties. She puts her leg up on the bed to unhook her stockings. Taylor is about to take off his pants, but stops.
</DIRECTION>
<TAYLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Darla, I don't think I can do this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAYLOR>
<DARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean? We did this between innings once.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARLA>
<TAYLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess I'm just not that guy anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAYLOR>
<DIRECTION>
Darla looks at him a long beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DARLA>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Happens to the best of them sooner or later. What's her name?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARLA>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HALL OUTSIDE TAYLOR'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens and Darla comes out, fully clothed now. She turns to say goodbye to Jake, who is still bare-chested.
</DIRECTION>
<DARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So long, Jake. Too bad. I was gonna devote a whole chapter to you in my book.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARLA>
<DIRECTION>
As Darla gives Jake a goodbye peck, the elevator door opens across the hall, and out steps Lynn. She's obviously rattled by the sight of Taylor and Darla together.
</DIRECTION>
<LYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me. I was in town for a conference and thought I'd drop by, but I can see you're busy...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYNN>
<DIRECTION>
With that she quickly steps back into the elevator and the doors close.
</DIRECTION>
<TAYLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lynn, wait...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAYLOR>
<DIRECTION>
Taylor leaps to the elevator door, but it's too late. He then sprints to the end of the hall and down the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TAYLOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
running down the stairs and into the lobby. Seeing no sign of Lynn, he races out the front door to see her pulling out in a taxi. He can only stand and watch her disappear into the night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE INDIANS' BUS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We PICK UP Vaughn making his way to the back of the bus, where Brown has his "office" on the last seat. Most of the other players are asleep after a late night of partying.
</DIRECTION>
<VAUGHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wanted to see me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VAUGHN>
<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeh, Rick. I just wanted to tell you that I'm startin' Harris tomorrow against the Yankees, even though it's your turn in the rotation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROWN>
<DIRECTION>
Vaughn says nothing, but he's clearly disappointed.
</DIRECTION>
<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's got more experience and a little better record against the Yankees.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROWN>
<VAUGHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeh, sure. Whatever's best for the team.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VAUGHN>
<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't read anything into it, Rick. You're one of the guys that got us here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROWN>
<VAUGHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeh, okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VAUGHN>
<DIRECTION>
Vaughn turns and walks back up the aisle. Brown watches him go, knowing he's still upset.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MUNICIPAL STADIUM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Indian bus pulls up outside the Stadium, where a group of several thousand fans wait. The players are showered with cheers and applause as they file out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vaughn sits in the bar alone, nursing a beer, still troubled by his demotion. He hears a sexy VOICE behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mind if I join you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Vaughn turns around to see Suzanne Dorn. She's dressed to draw blood, looking better than we've ever seen her. She slides into the booth.
</DIRECTION>
<VAUGHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think I'd be very good company tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VAUGHN>
<SUZANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</SUZANNE>
<VAUGHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothin'. Job problem.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VAUGHN>
<DIRECTION>
Vaughn falls silent. Suzanne stares at him with a devastating combination of sexual heat and tender admiration. She's pulling out all the stops. Vaughn's a little flustered.
</DIRECTION>
<VAUGHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm, ah, a ball player.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VAUGHN>
<SUZANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know, but that's not why I came over. I don't chase ball players.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUZANNE>
<VAUGHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why did you come over then?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VAUGHN>
<SUZANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because you're the sexiest man I've ever laid eyes on, and you look like you could use a... friend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUZANNE>
<DIRECTION>
We GO TO Vaughn. Forget it. He's a goner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VAUGHN'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vaughn has dozed off in the bed. Suzanne, is getting dressed. Vaughn wakes up as she finishes.
</DIRECTION>
<VAUGHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where you goin'?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VAUGHN>
<SUZANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've gotta get home.

</SUZANNE>
<VAUGHN>

	Mrs. Suzanne Dorn.

<DIRECTION>
(kissing him on the forehead)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So long. You're a great kid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUZANNE>
<DIRECTION>
With that she walks on out, leaving Vaughn dazed by the knowledge of who he's just slept with.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE HALL OUTSIDE VAUGHN'S ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Taylor is coming back from the bathroom down the hall as Suzanne comes out of Vaughn's room.
</DIRECTION>
<SUZANNE>

	Hello, Jake.

</SUZANNE>
<TAYLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Suzanne.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAYLOR>
<DIRECTION>
Taylor is amazed by what he's just seen. As soon as Suzanne is out of sight, he goes to Vaughn's room and opens the door.
</DIRECTION>
<TAYLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vaughn?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAYLOR>
<DIRECTION>
Vaughn is sitting on his bed in a state of disbelief.
</DIRECTION>
<VAUGHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I swear to God I didn't know who she was.

Taylor nods that it's all right even though he doesn't believe it.

<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:

<DIRECTION>
THE LIMO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
pulling up outside the church. Lynn is helped out of the car by her Father. As she starts up the steps, she sees that both sides are lined by the entire Cleveland Indians team in uniform. They form an arch of bats as she passes. At the top of the steps is Taylor. Lynn stops as her father ushers her mother on into the church.
</DIRECTION>
<TAYLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You look beautiful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAYLOR>
<LYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>

<TAYLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeh, you too.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me one thing. The night you came up to my hotel -- was there really a library conference?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAYLOR>
<LYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I came to see you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYNN>
<TAYLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too bad it didn't work out better. I just wanna say I'm sorry for all the things I've put you through over the years.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAYLOR>
<LYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Even for last night?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYNN>
<TAYLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't be sorry for that. Nothing happened.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAYLOR>
<DIRECTION>
He says this with absolute conviction. Despite herself, Lynn senses that he's telling the truth.
</DIRECTION>
<LYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then you weren't defending my honor again?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYNN>
<TAYLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't have to. She knew she was outclassed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAYLOR>
<DIRECTION>
Lynn smiles. He gives her a kiss and watches as she goes inside. He stands there a long beat, then turns and walks slowly down the steps past his teammates.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RACHEL PHELPS' OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rachel is looking out at the empty stadium. There's a KNOCK at the door.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
The door is opened by a Male Secretary and in steps Lou Brown.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>

	Hello, Lou, what can I do for ya?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
Lou puts a folded piece of paper on her desk.
</DIRECTION>
<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wanted to hand in my resignation before you had a chance to fire me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROWN>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know what you been tryin' to do with this team. After the season, I want no part of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROWN>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I knew I could count on Charlie to tell somebody. I was just afraid he might take too long.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why would you want him to tell somebody?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROWN>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you'd tell the team, hopefully getting them mad enough to knock themselves out trying to prove they belonged in this league. I think it worked.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You tryin' to make me believe you wanted us to win all along?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROWN>
<DIRECTION>
Rachel nods.
</DIRECTION>
<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bullshit. What about the plane, the bus, the bad hotels...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROWN>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We were broke. We couldn't afford anything better. Donald left the team nearly bankrupt. If we'd had another losing season, I would have had to sell the team. I knew we couldn't win with the team we had, so I decided to bring in new players and see how they'd do with the proper motivation. There was never any offer from Miami. I made it all up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why should I believe any of this? Now that we're winnin' it's easy for you to jump on the bandwagon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROWN>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I'd really wanted you to lose, all I had to do was send the best players back to the minors. But I didn't, did I?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
Brown has no comeback for this. He knows now that she's telling the truth.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think this was all an accident? I personally scouted every member of this team, except Hayes, of course. He was a surprise. They all had flaws which concealed their real talent, or I wouldn't have been able to get them. But I knew if anyone could straighten them out, you could. And if you tell them any of this, I will fire you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
Brown can only shake his head at this whole thing.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love this team, Lou. Go get 'em tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
The two shake hands. Brown looks at Rachel a beat, still looking for some sign of duplicity. Finally he gives her a grudging smile of respect.
</DIRECTION>

INT. THE TURK - LATE AFTERNOON

Taylor, Hayes, Vaughn and the others are getting ready to board the bus to the stadium. Taylor pulls Vaughn aside.

Vaughn nods.

	Hello, everybody, Harry Doyle bidding you a Wahoo welcome from beautiful Municipal Stadium, where tonight before a capacity crowd of 75,000 screaming featherheads, the braves of the Cuyahoga will leave their teepees in search of Cleveland's first League Championship in over 30 years. Standing in the way, their long time nemesis, the New York Yankees, the Big Boys of Broadway, who have beaten the Indians like a tom-tom all year long.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOYLE>

Down in the dugout, the players are lined up ready to take the field. They exchange words of encouragement, hand slaps, clenched fists, but all at a very low key level. This is tension time.

	All right, guys, let's take it to 'em.

The Indians charge onto the field to a standing ovation.

In the center field bleachers Thelma's victory blanket containing the scores of every Indian game for the season, hangs from a railing. Bobby, Vic and Johnny pound the tom- toms leading the stadium in a monster version of "In the Land of Burning Waters." Even the groundskeepers join in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two down in the first. Harris looking sharp so far... Bouncing ball to third. Dorn up with it.

The crowd and bleacher band begins to clap as Dorn takes his lead. Cerrano swings at the first pitch and misses. An audible groan goes through the crowd.

<DIRECTION>
YANKEE HITTER

<DIRECTION>
lining a single to right field. Harris mops his brow, obviously tiring.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER YANKEE HITTER
</DIRECTION>

smashing a double off the wall, the lead runner stopping at third. Brown signals to the bullpen to get somebody warm.

on the mound, looking like he's out of gas.
</DIRECTION>
<DOYLE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Activity continues in the pen, as Harris is really digging himself a hole now. He got the first two hitters, and then gave up a single and a double and has now gone 3-0 to Cheevers.
	</DIALOGUE>

Harris comes set and fires to the plate. It's way high.

	</DIALOGUE>
</BROWN>
<DIRECTION>
VAUGHAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
striding in from the bullpen. He doesn't look relaxed. As he nears the infield he purposely doesn't look at Dorn. Dorn stares at him with undisguised venom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Vaughan gets to the mound, he sees Patton getting his convict uniform on in the Yankee dugout. He looks away to see Haywood in the on-deck circle smiling out at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile, the CROWD has gone nuts at the sight of Vaughn. Bobby, Vic and Johnny are blasting out "Wild Thing" on the tom-toms and the whole stadium, 75,000 strong, is singing it. Doyle just pushes the mic forward and lets the crowd do it's work.
</DIRECTION>
<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, Ricky, Haywood likes the hard stuff in. Curve him on the hands, bust him away, and don't get up with anything. You listenin' to me Rick?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROWN>
<DIRECTION>
Vaughn nods, but we can tell he's too nervous to have digested any of that.
</DIRECTION>
<BROWN>

	O.K., kid, you're my man. Let's go get him.

No sooner has Taylor settled in behind the plate, than Dorn starts toward the mound. Vaughn watches him come with fear and trepidation.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAYLOR>

Dorn arrives at the mound, and holds out his hand for the ball. Vaughn gives it to him. Dorn rubs it up, staring long and hard into Vaughn's eyes. Vaughn is sweating bullets. Finally Dorn speaks.
</DIRECTION>
<DORN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's cut through the crap. I only got one thing to say to you. Just rear back and strike this motherfucker out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORN>
<DIRECTION>
He smiles and hands Vaughn the ball back. Vaughn returns the smile and accepts the ball. While Dorn trots back to his position, Vaughn turns his back to the plate for one last moment of concentration. As he turns around to face us, we see a new man as the wicked opening CHORDS of X's "Wild Thing" are heard on the TRACK, only louder and more savage than before.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vaughn steps up on the rubber, his face hardened into fierce resolve. There's nothing nervous about him now. This kid is gonna make somebody pay.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Haywood steps in, the American League triple crown winner. .341 average, 48 homers, 121 R.B.I.'s. He's homered the only two times he's faced Vaughn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOYLE>
<DIRECTION>
Taylor sets down a sign. Two fingers for the curve ball. Vaughn shakes it off. Taylor puts down another sign. Vaughn shakes it off. Finally, Taylor puts down one finger -- the fast ball. Vaughn nods with steely purpose.
</DIRECTION>
<TAYLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, Ricky, let's get nasty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAYLOR>
<DIRECTION>
Vaughn winds and delivers a hissing blur toward the plate. Haywood takes a ferocious swing and misses. Strike one.

We see the number 97 come up on the digital readout of the SPEED GUN which a club employee holds behind the screen.

	All right, looks like the boy is pumped. Sucker was movin', wasn't it? Ever hit ya, it'd leave a two foot hole comin' out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAYLOR>

Taylor gets ready to flash another sign. The convict jumps up and down trying to distract Vaughn. No way.

<TAYLOR>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's see, what should we call now. Let's see how he feels about old number one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAYLOR>
<DIRECTION>
Taylor puts down one finger. Vaughn nods and then winds and fires again, another blazing rocket. Haywood takes a wicked rip, but doesn't get it. Strike two. 99 comes up on the gun. The convict has stopped jumpin'.
</DIRECTION>
<TAYLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice swing, Haywood. Good follow- through. Keep it up, I'll show you the ball sometime.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAYLOR>
<DIRECTION>
The fans are going wild. They're all standing now, yelling for a strikeout. Vaughn gets back up on the rubber with the look of an animal sighting prey. Taylor gets down to give the sign.

Taylor wiggles his fingers around and then puts down the big No. 1. Vaughn gives him a quick nod.

	And if I don't see you again, Haywood, have a nice winter. Okay, buddy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAYLOR>

Vaughn goes into his windup and unleashes a screaming bullet toward the plate. Haywood pulls the trigger, but it's already by him. Strike three. 101 on the gun. Taylor leaps up and gives Vaughn the fist. The fans are going berserk. MUSIC ends.

</DOYLE>
<DIRECTION>
Taylor and the others yell encouragement to Hayes as he digs in at the plate. The Yankee pitcher delivers and Hayes hits a high bouncer toward short. The shortstop waits for it to come down and then fires to first. Too late. Hayes streaks across the bag, beating the throw by a hair. Once again the CROWD comes to life.

	Duke leads the league in saves, strikeouts per inning and nose hairs.

The Duke finishes his warmups and stares over at Hayes. Hayes smiles, snaps his black gloves out of his hip pocket, and carefully pulls them on over his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Duke does not care for this kind of showmanship.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brown comes over to talk to Taylor, who's been watching Duke from the on-deck circle.
</DIRECTION>
<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ya know I'd be an ass not to pinch- hit for you here. You're 0 for 18 against Duke. Plus you're beat to shit you can hardly walk, there's no way you can get around on this guy's fast ball. So I want the absolute truth here. Can you beat this guy?

Pepper begins flashing signs out to Hayes. Duke gets up on the rubber and takes his stretch. Hayes leads away, crouching low. Duke snaps a throw over to first, the first baseman slapping a hard tag on Hayes, but Hayes is back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd is on its feet again. The "GO" chant starts, punctuated by thousands of black-gloved hands punching the night air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Duke comes set again. Hayes leads away. Duke watches him, checks him again. We go to SLOW MOTION as Duke kicks and comes to the plate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hayes takes off like a shot, head down, eating up ground. Taylor swings and misses. The Yankee catcher comes up throwing, rifling a clothesline dart to second base. Hayes leaves his feet diving for the bag. The second baseman snaps down the tag. Too late. Hayes is in there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The stadium is really rockin' now. Duke prowls the mound. Taylor steps out of the box and flashes a sign to Brown.

</PEPPER>
<BROWN>

Brown flashes a sign out to Hayes. A hint of a smile comes over Hayes' face as he dusts himself off.

Taylor steps back in as Duke gets up on the rubber. Taylor digs in his back foot, then points to the left field bleachers ala Babe Ruth.

The crowd, electrified by Taylor's gesture, remains on its feet. Duke stares in at Taylor, comes to his stretch and then lets go a steaming fast ball right at Taylor's head. Taylor goes down in a swirl of dust, the ball missing him by inches. The stadium explodes with BOOS, but as soon as Taylor picks himself up, the crowd begins to ROAR again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby, Vic and Johnny are pounding out a heavy beat on the TOM-TOMS. Everyone in the stadium begins to CLAP in unison with the DRUMS.

THE LONGSHOREMEN

THE BUSINESS EXECUTIVE

THE STADIUM AGAIN

Duke gets back on the hill. Getting the sign he wants, he comes to his stretch, checking Hayes at second.

As Duke starts his delivery to the plate, we go to SLOW MOTION. The clapping in the stadium stops as everyone hushes to watch the pitch. We...

They've all stopped too in anticipation of the pitch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE STADIUM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everything from here on will continue to be in SLOW MOTION. As Duke whips his arm toward the plate, Hayes takes off for third. Taylor, instead of swinging away, shortens up on the bat and bunts Duke's pitch down the third base line.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Yankee third baseman, caught completely unaware, charges the ball frantically.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TAYLOR

barreling down the line toward first on his sore legs, giving it everything he's got.

THE THIRD BASEMAN

scooping up the ball barehanded and firing on the run to first.

TAYLOR

pounding down the line. He strains for the bag as the Yankee first baseman stretches to his limit for the throw. Taylor and the ball arrive at almost the same time. Taylor hits the bag and then sprawls in the dirt as his knees give out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The umpire brings up his arms, and spreads them wide. Safe. Taylor's beaten it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The first baseman looks up to see something that strikes fear into his heart across the field. It's...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HAYES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
streaking for home, trying to score all the way from second on a bunt.
</DIRECTION>

The first baseman fires to the plate, as the catcher positions himself for the throw. Hayes launches into a flying feet- first slide. The catcher brings the tag down. Hayes hooks to the outside, his trailing foot reaching for the plate.

I) Up in the stands, Rachel watches all this with tears in her eyes.

Taylor starts off the field when he sees something that catches his eye. Standing by the field rail is Lynn. She holds up her left hand and smiles. There's no ring on it. Taylor races over to her as she jumps down from the rail and hugs herself to him. We HOLD on the celebration as it swirls all around them, and...
