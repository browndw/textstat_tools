The setting sun backlights a series of abstract colored images. Holy images of STAINED GLASS and lead.

FOOTSTEPS ECHO across the marble floor.

REVEAL - JULIE JAMES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A little older, a little wiser, yet still very pretty, no doubt. But she's all alone in the house of the Lord.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And those doleful eyes of hers clearly telegraph a very heavy burden still rests upon her soul.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She reluctantly walks past the rows of empty pews toward a curtained CONFESSIONAL BOOTH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONFESSIONAL BOOTH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Julie slides the drapes shut behind her as she enters, kneeling before the CLOSED SCREEN. A beat -- and the SCREEN SLIDES OPEN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A PRIEST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
enters the adjacent booth -- barely visible through the WICKER MESH. Julie looks down, crosses herself, and begins.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's been a year since my last confession...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<DIRECTION>
Julie swallows hard. This is difficult for her.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've never told anyone this. Not my mom, not the poice, not even my friends -- except for the ones who were there and they...well they're not around anymore. You see I...I...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<PRIEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRIEST>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I killed a man. Well, I thought I had...then...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<DIRECTION>
She balks at the memory of it. The priest bows his head in the shadows of the other side.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd) (emotional)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've got to understand...It was all an accident. A terrible accident. It's been a whole year. I've tried to get past this, but I just can't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<PRIEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go on...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRIEST>
<JULIE>

(reassuring)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRIEST>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see, he was a killer. He murdered Helen and Barry, and he would have killed me too, if I hadn't...gotten away with it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(regathering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know, I guess I just need to deal with the fear, the guilt...to finally say his name. Ben Willis. His name was Ben Willis...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<DIRECTION>
The confession is cathartic for Julie. She looks relieved until,
</DIRECTION>
<PRIEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRIEST>
<DIRECTION>
Julie stops. Looks through the screen. A chill shoots through her body.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know? But how could you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<DIRECTION>
Clouds of icy steam shoot through the partition. Julie moves closer to the screen, trying to get a better look.
</DIRECTION>
<PRIEST>
<DIRECTION>
(growls)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRIEST>
<DIRECTION>
A STEEL HOOK

smashes through the screen right in Julie's face! She SCREAMS!

SMASH CUT TO:

INT. COLLEDGE LECTURE HALL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Still screaming -- Julie jumps back, seemingly knocked out of her chair. She fights the unseen demon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sitting beside her, Julie's friend WILL BENSON reacts. He's a good- looking kid in a shy, humble kind of way. And he tries to help her, but she's too busy turning ten shades of red.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The PROFESSOR lowers his glasses, makes it even worse.
</DIRECTION>
<PROFESSOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice to see you find Political Science so stimulating --

<DIRECTION>
The lecture hall erupts with laughter.

Julie grabs her stuff and bolts.

Julie explodes out of the building. Hurries down a sidewalk. Will finally catches up.

</WILL>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>

Julie realizes this is true.

<JULIE>

	I had another dream, Will.

Will takes this seriously.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry.

</JULIE>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It just takes time, Julie. It's gonna get better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It can't get worse. I mean, it's not like this was the first time I freaked out in class. I hardly ever get a full night's sleep, my grades suck, I'm this close from being thrown out of school.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<DIRECTION>
BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! EXPLOSIONS. Julie jumps out of her skin. It's just STUDENTS letting off FIRECRACKERS as they fly past on bicycles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will and Julie are now thinking the same thing.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was one year ago...

	I'm trying. I really am...Sometimes I don't even know why I came up here in the first place.

<WILL>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To get out of Southport?

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. Now I remember.

He smiles at her. She smiles back. They stop in front of her apartment building.

<JULIE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you getting out of town on the fourth?

	I'm okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you sure?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
She touches his face affectionately.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks for the talk, Will. You're good to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<DIRECTION>
Will stands there akwardly --
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Um...Okay. Bye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Will walks away. Julie watches him a beat, then turns down her walk --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
steps out of the shadows. Julie practically faints.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, my god, Ray. You scared me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<DIRECTION>
Recovering, she hugs Ray, genuinely glad to see him. He's a bit cold.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got in early. I was excited...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(re: the receding Will)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who was that guy?

</RAY>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, that's Will. He's a friend. You'd like him.

</JULIE>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.

</RAY>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ray, we're just friend.

</JULIE>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the good-friend thing first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are you being like this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<DIRECTION>
It should be obvious Ray feels insecure in the college environs, but they're miscommunicating.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, I'm sorry. You're right. Are you ready to go? I've got the old truck. You know the drill...Crab boil at Ollie's. Croaker Queen Pageant...It's only small-town fun, but it's still nice. People really miss you. I miss you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at Ray, his compassionate demeanor. This is hard to say --
</DIRECTION>
<JULIE>
<DIRECTION>
(softly, but resolved)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ray, I can't...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just feel like some part of me hasn't healed up enough to go back. Like some critical piece is missing. Please understand...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<DIRECTION>
Ray is cold. This is what he's expected all along.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I understand something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not like that. It's not you. It's me. My head. I want to go back. I want to be with you. I want to be fine. I want everything to be like it used to be.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It just isn't.

</JULIE>
<DIRECTION>
Ray is hurt and confused.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, why don't you stay up here? They have fireworks over the river. And...there's a million things to do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to work, Julie. My boat's in Southport, remember? But, I get it. You need your space from Craokerland. And maybe from me, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
Ray starts walking away.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>

	<DIALOGUE>
	You know where to find me.

</RAY>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ray? Ray? At least come up for a while.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<DIRECTION>
Ray keeps on walking.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay. I'm just gonna go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
Julie follows him out to the road. A group of LAUGHING STUDENTS block her way.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ray, I'm sorry. I didn't mean...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to herself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm just scared...that's all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<DIRECTION>
But Ray is already gone. Julie stares after him a beat, then turns quickly to her door. She clearly feels uncomfortable, exposed on the walk alone. She nervously pulls her keys. A can of mace dangles from the keychain.

EXT. JULIE'S APARTMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Students throw FRISBEE in the street. Ray walks to his old truck, which is wedged between a new Sport Utility and a BMW.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He clambers into the front seat. He thinks. Then, digs into his pocket and pulls out the unmistakable shape of an ENGAGEMENT RING BOX. He throws it in the glove box, starts the truck and drives away.

INT. JULIE'S APARTMENT DOORWAY - DAY

Julie opens the door and steps inside. She locks three deadbolts. She stands there, alone, listening to the SILENCE. She doesn't even have a cat. A faucet DRIPS in the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JULIE'S KITCHEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The faucet DRIPS. Julie turns the handle. No success. She checks the lock on each window. She stands for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She picks up a bag of chips and eats a handful. She opens the fridge and takes out a can of nacho cheese sauce. She grabs a soft drink and a jar of bread-and-butter pickles. She gets some cookies from a shelf. She thinks. Opens the freezer, pulls out some fat-free sorbet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She takes the whole mess toward her bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JULIE'S BEDROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She hits the light switch. A bedside light goes on. It's a sparsely furnished room. The bed is pilled high with pillows. She checks the windows, then climbs into bed with the food.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the bedside table are pictures of family and friends. She looks at one of Helen and Barry. She looks around the room. It's depressing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Outside we hear young people having fun, slamming car doors, going places. She picks at the food, then puts it on the table. She turns off the bedside light and enjoys the golden late afternoon glow in the room.

Julie, sound asleep, is curled into fetal position on the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a CLICK in the front hall. And ANOTHER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Julie's eyes shoot open. She listens. Another SOUND, almost like the front door being CLOSED.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her arm reaches for the bedside light. She hits the switch. The bulb POPS.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIE>
<DIRECTION>
(whispers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Okay. Face your fears...

Julie silently scoots out of her bedroom toward the kitchen.

INT. JULIE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She gets a large KNIFE. She listens. It sounds like somone's in the living room. She steps through the kitchen door.

As she moves we see a shadow pass the other way down the hallway toward her bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JULIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't take this anymore. I can't.

Holding the knife in front of her, she tiptoes to the hallway. There's a soft RUSTLING coning from her bedroom. She gets a flashlight out of a drawer and starts down the hallway.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's just do it.

She moves faster toward her bedroom. she listens outside the doorway. It sounds like someone's in the closet. She moves into the room.

<DIRECTION>
INT. JULIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

There's a noise in the darkened closet. Julie moves into position.

She turns the flashlight ON and lunges for the closet.

INT THE CLOSET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KARLA WILSON, 19, all grace and attitude, is on tiptoes reaching for a box of shoes. She SCREAMS.

Julie SCREAMS. They both SCREAM together. Julie drops the knife and flashlight.

Julie turns on the light in the hallway. Karla has her shoes in her hand and black pants draped over her arm.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was heart attack time, Karla.

Julie sits next to Karla as she waits for her drink order.

Will is a few steps ahead as they move for the bar. Julie seems to be relaxing, having a good time. Then, she looks up into the balcony and sees, in a strobe light's FLASH --
</DIRECTION>

SOMEONE IN A SLICKER

There's no answer from dead Dave. Ray tries to see around the headlights. He moves slowly toward the truck.

The BRIGHTS and FOGS come on, blinding Ray. The truck's engine REVS. The truck rolls a few inches, adjusting a bead on Ray.

Then, tires spinning, the truck launches straight at Ray.

Ray runs at the truck. AT THE LAST MINUTE, he ducks behind the parked car.

Ray backs around the car --

Ray is exposed. He sees his truck closing fast. He's got nowhere to go. Then, at the very last second,

RAY

jumps off the edge of the road. His TRUCK SLAMS INTO THE BARRIER RIGHT WHERE RAY WAS STANDING. SPARKS FLY! METAL BUCKLES!

A nearly empty jet. Karla has her head on Tyrell's shoulder. Julie is reading a book.

Tyrell THROWS UP over the side.

The ferry pulls in to a canopied dock. A white-sand beach stretches in every direction. Beautiful tourists stroll about without a care in the world.

Tyrell stamps his feet on the dock.
</DIRECTION>
<TYRELL>

The main building is two stories high with a tiled roof. A bell tower rises from one side. And, of course, it is surounded on all sides by suffocating fooliage.

Karla THWACKS him on the back of the head, but they're all having fun.

The path widens. The trees part. It's even nicer up close. They walk across a tiled plaza.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind them, THREE YOUNG GUYS carry their GIRLFRIENDS piggyback, racing each other toward the departure dock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Our two arriving couples move on toward the entrace, passing a FENCED TENNIS COURT on the left. A GLASS-PANED ORCHID HOUSE straight ahead. And, on the right,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LUSH POOL with a built-in JACUZZI in the shallow end. An outdoor THATCHED ROOF BAR stands nearby -- and just beyonk it, a small POOL HOUSE.

The hotel is tastefully appointed with island decor. AN ORNATE METAL STAIRCASE leads UP to the ROOMS -- and DOWN (AS THE SIGN SAYS) TO A FITNESS CENTER.

In one direction, the foyer meets the entrance to a tropical RESTAURANT/BAR. And in the other, A LOOBY LOUNGE is visible -- surrounded by four walls of BOOKS and HOTEL MEMORABILIA.

In a dark corner of the room, a uniformed MAID named OLGA dusts off a massive WOODEN GLOBE.

Julie smiles at the woman on their way through the lobby, but Olga shyly looks away.

Arriving at the FRONT DESK, the four of them find it deserted. They wait patiently, then impatiently.

Julie and Karla laugh. Karla goes to hit the bell once more -- ONLY TO HAVE HER HAND GRABBED IN THE PROCESS.

Karla gasps. Pulls away. We see the hand belongs to the hotel manager -- BROOKS, balding, 40s, talks slowly, and seems to have secrets he won't share with guests.

A resort bar on the beach. Ocean breezes and surf SOUNDS come through the window.

<DIRECTION>
It's tiki galore, complete with a bamboo bar and fishing gear hanging from decorative nets from the ceiling. There's a KARAOKE STAGE in the corner.

Reluctantly she goes to the song book. She sees something particularily awful.

(to Tyrell)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Song number thirty-nine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<DIRECTION>
Tyrell nods and punches a few buttons. Julie takes the stage as sappy strings begin to swell. She looks at the MONITOR, then melodramatically at the crowd, and begins to sing -- no, BELT -- Gloria Gaynor's "I WILL SURVIVE."

<JULIE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	First I was afraid...I was petrified...

Will stands, clapping. Tyrell pounds his chest. Karla flips up her LIGHTER, swaying like a hard-core fan. And Julie continues, crooning out the chorus as the beat kicks in and the gang begins to dance.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIE>

	I will survive...I will survive...

ANGLE ON THE KARAOKE MONITOR

The schmaltzy lyrics keep scrolling by -- white against black. But then...in the middle of the song...the color changes. RED CAPITAL\ LETTERS BEGIN TO FILL THE SCREEN.

<JULIE>

(cont'd) (singing -- then trailing off)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I still know...what you did... last summer...

Her voice trails. Her smile abruptly fades.

<WILL>

</WILL>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's...him.

<WILL>

</WILL>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He did something to the screen...it, it, said...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<DIRECTION>
Julie loos at the screen -- the normal lyrics are still scrolling. She suddenly feels their eyes upon her. They're looking at her like she's having a nervous breakdown.

<JULIE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing. Nothing, I'm sorry...

Julie steps into her room. Closes the door behind her. She falls back against it, trying to calm herself down.

<JULIE>

	There's no way...just stop it right now...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>

She looks around the cozy room.

	Closet. Bed. Bathroom. No need to panic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<DIRECTION>
Julie starts to undress, get ready for bed, the day of travel finally catching up with her. She grabs something to sleep in. Tosses it on the bed. And that's when she sees it,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE - ENVELOPE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
propped on the pillows. Her name written across. She is frozen momentarily.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Almost against her will, she moves toward the envelope. She reaches down and picks it up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She hesitates, then opens the envelope. She pulls out a SINGLE WHITE CARD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON THE CARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In bold print it reads: SURPRISE!

<DIRECTION>
DARKFIGURE

<DIRECTION>
appears over Julie's shoulder. Julie can feel the presence. She spins, scaring --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WILL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
who YELLS and drops the flowers and champagne he was holding. The bottle bursts and covers them with spray.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIE>
<DIRECTION>
(realizing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Will! I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's my fault. I shouldn't have...I didn't think...

She grabs a TOWEL off the bathroom door, trying to help him clean up the mess.

	No, no, no. This was really sweet...

	Hey, you don't have to appologize to me. I'm the one. I understand.

He picks up a rose. Most of its petals on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just really like you and I want you to feel good about everything...You know? I want you to be happy.

She falls back against the plush comforter, looking up at herself in a long MIRROR HANGING RIGHT OVER THE BED. Tyrell loves this and quickly moves beside her in the bed. She lets him get real close, then she jumps up --

Karla pulls her suit out of a bag and models it seductively and flirtatiously for Tyrell.

Derrick, the dockhand, whistles in the darkness as he coils the bow rope of a service boat around a cleat on the dock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ominous shadows play all along the dock. Out on the water there's a big SPLASH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dockhand rises, looking out at the water with a sigh.
</DIRECTION>
<DERRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn. I should've brought my pole.

</DERRICK>
<DIRECTION>
He turns away. As he does, we see
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END OF THE DOCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
where a sinister SLICKER FIGURE stands perfectly still, silhouetted by moonlight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Derrick paces down the dock the other way past a handfull of other tied-off staff and service boats.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He picks up a hose and begins spraying down the hull of a Sunfish sailboat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns the hose off and begins coiling it, backing toward an EQUIPMENT SHACK. Suddenly, a HAND touches him on the back. He jumps and turns to see --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TITUS

standing there smoking a spliff.

Titus glides away into the dark. Derrick watches him go. There's another SPLASH in the water near the dock.

Derrick walks to where the splash was. He kneels down by the edge -- watching BUBBLES RISE from the dark water below.

AND THEN -- RISING SLOWLY FROM THE DARK WATER DIRECTLY BEHIND THE DOCKHAND -- A SINISTER SLICKER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Derrick hears A SPLASH -- and just in time for...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SPLAT! THE OLD HOOK IN THE EYE. THE FISHERMAN PULLS HIM DOWN. HE SCREAMS -- BEN YANKS ON THE HOOK -- AND DERRICK'S CRUMPLED BODY FALLS INTO THE WATER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON THE WATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as poor Derrick's BLOOD MIXES WITH BUBBLES...

EXT. POOL/JACUZZI - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bubbles of a different kind. The JACUZZI sits in an enclosure at the shallow end of the SWIMMING POOL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And enjoying its warmth, Karla and Tyrell are liplocked in the churning tub. MUSIC plays on the boombox beside them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tempurature rises and Ty's hands begin to wander. Still clad in her cute bikini, Karla pulls away --

<KARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sure you didn't pick up my hair tie?

She splashes him.

<KARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you get feisty...

</KARLA>
<DIRECTION>
Tyrell moves in for the kill. He won't take no for an answer.
</DIRECTION>
<TYRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too late for that. We're miles from anywhere, baby. No one's gonna hear you scream.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYRELL>
<DIRECTION>
He goes in for a serious kiss. Things start to heat up --
</DIRECTION>
<KARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I used to be a lifeguard...I'd hate to have to blow my whistle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARLA>
<TYRELL>
<DIRECTION>
(playful)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd hate for you to have to blow...your whistle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYRELL>
<DIRECTION>
Tyrell is done talking. He pulls her over to him and the moment becomes more passionate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Karla opens her eyes in time to see --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TITUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
surface in the pool next to them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Karla SCREAMS. And not just because it was a surprise. Titus looks even uglier when he's wet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Titus opens his mouth, reveals a smoking PHILLY BLUNT on the end of his tounge.
</DIRECTION>
<TITUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No water sports after midnight. Hotel policy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITUS>
<DIRECTION>
Titus eyes Karla in the Jacuzzi. Tyrell moves protectively in front of her.
</DIRECTION>
<TYRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the policy on burnin' herb?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYRELL>
<TITUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We got one for that, too. It's don't try until you buy.

<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't buy any, you don't get any.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITUS>
<DIRECTION>
Titus blows a cloud of smoke on them both, rolls the joint back into his mouth, and swims off. Tyrell is angry, but Karla pulls him back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A dejected Will appears in his bathing suit, a towel over his arm. Tyrell sees him coming.
</DIRECTION>
<TYRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's ten people on this whole island and they're all gonna end up in this Jacuzzi with us.

INT. HOTEL - JULIE'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The DOOR CREAKS OPEN once again to her room. And from a STRANGER'S POV -- WE SLOWLY CREEP INSIDE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CLOUD OF STEAM billows from the open BATHROOM. THE SOUND OF A SHOWER is heard. We MOVE TOWARD IT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SHOWER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eyes closed, Julie stands with her face right under the showerhead, trying to relax. Something softly goes THUMP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Julie opens her eyes. Turns off the shower. Stands there, frozen, listening.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIE>
<DIRECTION>
(calling out)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<DIRECTION>
No reply.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE BATHROOM DOORWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a robe with a towel on her head, Julie peeks into her room. Nobody there. She sighs, and crosses back to the bathroom sink.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE SINK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Julie looks to a spot where her toothbrush should be. She frowns. Looks around. Some of her things are missing. She peers into the fogged-up bathroom mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She whips the TOWEL off her head and WIPES IT ACROSS THE MIRROR, MAKING THE BEDROOM BEHIND HER VISIBLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ready to spit, she looks down. AND IN THAT INSTANT -- WE SEE A SHADOWY FIGURE PASS BEHIND HER IN THE BEDROOM. She looks back up...and HE'S GONE. Julie turns on the water to rinse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON THE BEDROOM DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as it SLOWLY CREAKS SHUT, the SOUND DROWNED OUT by the SINK.

Julie turns off the water -- and KLUNK-KLUNK -- and NOISE at her door. The sound STOPS.

<DIRECTION>
She steps out of the bathroom, crossing toward the door.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIE>

No answer. She peers through the PEEPHOLE.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<DIRECTION>
She unlocks and opens it. Nobody there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Julie quickly closes the door and relocks it, her heart rate just begining to rise again as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KLUNK-KLUNK. She hears it again. Then, the sound STOPS. But standing at the door -- she realizes that's not where it came from. Her eyes immediately go to...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CLOSET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Damn. That's where it came from. She slowy pads across the room in her slippers toward the door. Trembling...she reaches for the handle...AND TUGS IT OPEN!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's NOTHING. She stares a beat. DRIP DRIP DRIP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She sees something on the floor of the closet. She touches a finger to it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IT'S BLOOD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE DOCKHAND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
comes dropping down at her, dangling, enmeshed in barbed wire. He's dying before our eyes. Blood bubbling from his mouth. His body twitching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Julie stares at the body. She's almost catatonic. She blinks. She blinks again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, in DEATH CONVULSIONS, his arms fly toward her --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She SCREAMS --

INT. HOTEL - JULIE'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone is gathered in the center of Julie's room. Julie is held tight by Will. Brooks, the hotel manager, conducts the investigation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brooks approaches the closet door. Julie holds her breath. He throws it open. A long beat.
</DIRECTION>
<BROOKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't find this at all funny.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROOKS>
<DIRECTION>
Julie steps in -- stares into the empty closet. She can't believe her eyes.

She searches their faces, looking for someone to believe her.

CUT TO:

INT. HOTEL TOWER ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a claustrophobic room. Estes turns away from the window, shirtless in his uniform pants. A beaded cord hangs around his neck, small fishhook dangling from it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beside the candle, he picks up a leather bag and dumps out a handful of voodoo icons: roots, coins, sea glass, chicken's foot. He sets them on a divination tray.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He opens vials and sprinkles powder and assorted liquids into a small wooden bowl. He opens a drawer and extracts a toothbrush. He dips the brush in the bowl -- covering its bristles with a sticky goo. He holds the brush over the candle's flame. The old man watches it SIZZLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ESTES picks up
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A STRAW FIGURE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
and impales it on his fishhook necklace.

She turns back to the linens. Something bloody is wrapped inside of them. She paws at the sheets, trying to unravel the mystery --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door the Room 228 slowly cracks open. A STEEL HOOK reaches out and slices into her apron. It tugs. She turns, and she starts to SCREAM, she is yanked into the room.

A DO NOT DISTURB sign flips over the handle and the door SLAMS shut.

He turns to see the dog bounding at him --

Tyrell leaps up the fence just as the pit bull lunges for him. The dog catches his pant leg. Tyrell kicks him away and frantically scrambles up.

<TYRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We gotta find flashlights, torches, guns if they got 'em, anything that'll help.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYRELL>

Will and Tyrell eye the stairs leading down to the lobby.
</DIRECTION>
<TYRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait. Maybe he's down there collecting the body parts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYRELL>

Will and Tyrell exchange a glance, an "are you man enough?" kind of glance.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

</WILL>
<TYRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, wait right here, it's the safest place.

</TYRELL>
<DIRECTION>
Karla is terrified and waits by the stairs, but something catches Julie's eye. She walks across the lobby.
</DIRECTION>
<KARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Julie, where are you going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARLA>
<DIRECTION>
Julie keeps walking. She sees historical pictures of the hotel: work crews during construction; the first limbo contest; fishermen standing next to sailfish and marlin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Near the pictures, Julie sees the globe. It's spinning slowly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Julie hesitates, then walks toward the globe. It stops spinning. She looks down at it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON - THE GLOBE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
and Julie's hand finding Brazil. We see the capital is not Rio, but Brazilia. This is dawning on Julie when we hear --
</DIRECTION>
<ESTES>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Brasilia.

</ESTES>

She jumps out of her skin. Estes was standing right there in the shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<ESTES>

	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the capital of Brazil, not Rio.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESTES>
<DIRECTION>
Karla SCREAMS.

Tyrell comes flying across the lobby past Karla. He dives on Estes, tackling him to the floor. Will is right behind him.

	I haven't hurt anyone...I stole those things to help you. To protect you.

	He's telling the truth. He could've easily killed me. He didn't.

	Look, we didn't even answer the radio question right...This whole thing was a setup.

<KARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARLA>
<JULIE>

Estes steps forward --

(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I've seen him around again. Out in the woods by the orchard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESTES>

They look at Estes...Is he telling the truth?
</DIRECTION>
<ESTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't remeber his name, but I don't forget a face.

They look to the office, the gym...The sense of death surrounding them.

	I know I don't want to stay in here.

Establish. The rain pounds a fleet of fishing boats. The boats are securely battened down in the weather.

INT. PAULSEN'S BOAT HOUSE - NIGHT

A gear-strewn office. Paulsen watches an episode of Party of Five. There is a loud KNOCKING at the door.
</DIRECTION>
<PAULSEN>

	What the...

</PAULSEN>

Paulsen slowly gets up. He cracks the door open. Ray stands silhouetted against the rain.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need to get to Tower Bay Island.

</RAY>

Paulsen senses something isn't right.

Ray pushes his way in --

	I need to get there, now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
Paulsen looks at him standing there drenched.
</DIRECTION>
<PAULSEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you happen to notice what's going on outside?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULSEN>
<DIRECTION>
Ray pulls out the gun and points it at Paulsen --

EXT. WOODS TRAIL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Estes, Will, Tyrell, Julie, and Karla walk along a trail through the heart of the island. The storm has abated for a few minutes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's windy, dark, and spooky. The kind of place you'd take people if you wanted to scare them with a classic ghost story. That is just what Estes is doing.
</DIRECTION>
<ESTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He worked here for many years. He had a nice family. A pretty wife and two little ones. A boy and a girl. They'd be about your age, now.
	</DIALOGUE>

They continue along the path.

Estes looks at them in the dark, slowing for just a second.

	One day his wife went missing. Maid found blood all over the honeymoon suite -- Room 201.

There are strange NOISES out in the woods.
</DIRECTION>
<ESTES>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eventually, they found her body. Pieces. A leg in the swamp. An arm washed up on Three Mile Beach.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the head they found much later.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESTES>
<DIRECTION>
A huge branch is blown from a tree and comes crashing down through the underbrush, scaring them. Estes calmly steps around it.
</DIRECTION>
<ESTES>

	People say she was running around on him. People say he caught her in bed with other men. People say a lot of things.

<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He disappeared, taking the two small ones with him. At least they were never found.
	</DIALOGUE>

The winding path leads to a small orchard. They hang on his every word.

<ESTES>

	We're here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESTES>

In the center of the orchard is a cemetery.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They move off the path into the safety of the woods. There seems to be activity around the place. It's silent and eerie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Julie stares, fascinated. She is slowly drawn toward the house. Karla grabs for her arm.
</DIRECTION>
<KARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be careful, Julie.

</KARLA>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got to see.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<DIRECTION>
She leads, they follow, circling the house. Julie rounds a corner of the shack and stops. She sees --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO TOMBSTONES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The first stone reads: SARAH WILLIS (birth/death)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The second stone reads: SUSIE WILLIS (birth/death)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beyond them
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FRESHLY DUG GRAVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
and the group moves slowly toward it. The headstone, partially obscured by the mound of dirt, comes into view.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The third headstone reads:

	My grave stays empty!

	Julie, the boats are gone, the phones are down. There's no way off this place.

<KARLA>

They move cautiously into the kitchen. Blue emergency lights flicker above them. It's a big room with plenty of nooks and crannies for somebody to be hiding in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tyrell picks up a couple of different knives. He hefts them in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<TYRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What I need is a gun. Not a steak knife.

Karla grabs a paring knife --

He picks up a huge butcher's knife and cuts the air with it. He then roughly empties other drawers looking for more weapons.

Karla looks to Julie, something on her mind. Julie catches the look.

Tyrell picks up on the mood swing. He moves closer to them. He's sympathetic.

	Forget that. You didn't do nothing. This fisherman's a piece of scum.

CLANK. There's a soft CLATTERING from somewhere in the room. Everyone freezes, staring into the darkness.

Tyrell puts a finger to his lips, then creeps down an aisle, listening. There's nothing but SILENCE.

He moves toward the first aisle...He jumps out. The aisle is empty.

<DIRECTION>
JULIE AND KARLA

Tyrell ducks around to the second aisle. He slices the air, ready to pounce. This aisle is empty.

Tyrell moves stealthily toward the third aisle...This is it. He lunges forward into the row...Empty, also.

The women run up the stairs. Behind them, we hear Ben's FOOTFALLS echoing.

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

<DIRECTION>
On the top floor, they race toward the end of a dark hallway.

At the far end of the hall, Nancy illuminates a section of the ceiling.

Julie helps Nancy reach a pull cord in the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A WOODEN LADDER

<DIRECTION>
pulls down. Nancy quickly climbs up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEN WILLIS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
enters the hallway and continues toward them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE LADDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Karla slips, nearly knocking Julie to the floor. They both scramble upwards --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben hits the ladder --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just as Julie reaches the top rung she SCREAMS --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEN'S HOOK IS ON HER FOOT!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nancy appears in the opening and throws a brick down at Ben. It hits him in the chest and knocks him back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Julie makes it into the attic. They pull the ladder up behind them like a drawbridge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL ATTIC - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Julie, Karla, and Nancy surround the hatch they've just shut. They fumble with it --
</DIRECTION>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's no way to lock it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<KARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do we do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARLA>
<DIRECTION>
From below comes LAUGHTER. There's a tug on the hatch, cracking it open. The girls pull it back shut, but it's hard to get a grip.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's more tugging, the hatch bending down; they can see Ben. Then, the rope SNAPS. The hatch slams shut.
</DIRECTION>
<NANCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's no way to grip this thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NANCY>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the STEEL TIP of the HOOK pokes through the crack...It wriggles around...Turning...And begins to pull the hatch down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They try to hold it...But it's no use. They let go and jump away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The attic is lit by a cathedral window. It's crosshatched with wooden beams and pink insulation.
</DIRECTION>
<NANCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watch your step...

</NANCY>
<DIRECTION>
THUNK! Karla's foot goes through a gap between two beams.

</NANCY>
<DIRECTION>
Karla and Julie follow her precarious progress.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben climbs off the ladder to a beam. He watches them leap from beam to beam. His hook glints in the light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Julie, Karla, and Nancy move toward the cathedral window. They turn. They are cut off. They spread out against the wall looking for an opening to get back to the hatch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben feints toward Nancy then swipes at Julie --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He misses. She leaps away. She looks down. Instead of insulation, she sees a
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WINDOW INTO THE HONEYMOON SUITE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She sees her bed through a one-way mirror. Julie stares, momentarily transfixed. Karla is edging her way around the side of Ben.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
<DIRECTION>
(re: the mirror)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'd be amazed by what you'd see. My wife with every man on the island, for example.

Ben suddenly whirls and lunges at Karla. He grabs her, but they both lose their balance, teetering for a moment on one of the beams, before falling --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They CRASH through the mirror --

<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL - KARLA AND TYRELL'S ROOM - NIGHT

Karla and Ben hit the bed in a rain of glass.

Karla looks behind her, sees
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE GLASS ROOF OF THE ORCHID HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
which doesn't look nealy strong enough to suppor her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben advances, swining the hook. Karla leaps over the railing and onto the glass.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. GREENHOUSE ROOF - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Karla keeps a wary eye on Ben as she gingerly backs up on the glass. The GLASS begins CRACKING, subtle crack lines splintering out from her footsteps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben lunges and swipes at her with his hook.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Karla leans away from the attack and loses her balance, slipping onto her back on the glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She lifts her head. Starts to move...CRACK. The glass is fracuring beneath her. She looks through the glass.

A sprawling, steam-filled room, dense with vegetation of all sorts and shelf after shelf of beautiful orchids.
</DIRECTION>

Karla lies unconscious. Slowly, she opens her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a rustling in the flowers. She tries to get up, but can't yet. She waits in terror as
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BIRDS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
fly up and out of the hole she's made in the roof.

Karla tries to stand and her leg gives way. She tests her knee --

Karla starts hobbling. She reaches the door -- it's locked from the other side.

There is a thick glass window set in the middle of the door.

Ben swings. The hook rips Karla's shoe, but Julie and Nancy pull her through.

</JULIE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's my boy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
Ben holds her back to look at her. He throws back the hood of his slicker. We see his face clearly for the first time.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no, no --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<DIRECTION>
Ben pulls off his hook and strokes Julie's cheek with his stump.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shush, now. No more screaming...No more running. Time to die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<RAY>
<DIRECTION>
(v.o.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let go of her! Now!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
Ben and Will spin to see
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
like the hero from a western, step out from behind a tree.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben starts to laugh. Will joins him.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You gotta be kiddin' me.

</WILL>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What're you gonna do, boy? Call us names?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let her go. Now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
Ray raises the .38 caliber handgun. He COCKS the hammer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben doesn't let go of Julie. Lightning fast, he slaps his hook back on and gets the point to Julie's neck.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Think about it, boy. You're no killer.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's my job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
Ray hesitates, his finger on the trigger. He does look scared.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben takes a step toward Ray. Then another, pushing Julie in front of him. Will moves closer, too.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop right there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
Ray's finger squeezing down the trigger.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't have it in you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, Will dives for Ray. Ray gets a shot off, tagging Ben in the shoulder. The gun goes flying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Julie spins and hits Ben in the face. He knocks her into her own grave...Mud begins to slide in on her. She tries to scramble out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will and Ray wrestle, punching each other repeatedly in the face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will has Ray down and his hands around his kneck. He looks him in the eye.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We haven't missed you down here, Ray boy. I got to know Julie real well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Will gets the better of Ray. He's stronger. He yanks him up -- choking him. Ray is begging to check out.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Think of all the things I'm gonna do to her.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad, finish him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Ben charges toward Ray's back. He pulls back the hook for a roundhouse slashing --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the last second, Ray dips, elbows Will.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE HOOK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
goes straight into Will's chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fisherman has hooked his own son.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Father and son make final eye contact, the son's eyes go blank.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben stares in shock as Will expires, falling back into the mud.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben SCREAMS in rage. Ray is tired.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THWACK. Ben begins beating Ray. He puches him. He straight-arms him with the hook. He knocks him again and again and Ray is beaten, giving up...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben has Ray against a tombstone. The hook slowly inches toward his eye.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gonna blind you first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
The hook is touching the eyelid --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A GUNSHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
rings out. A look of wonder crosses Ben's face. He slowly turns away from Ray.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JULIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stands behind him holding the gun.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just...Die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<DIRECTION>
BLAM. BLAM. BLAM. She empties the gun into Ben, who flies backward into Julie's grave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he tumbles, Ben releases the dirt stacked beside the grave...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MUDDY LANDSLIDE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
slowly covers Ben up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben's face is covering over. His mouth starting to fill with dirt --
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't kill me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
His face is completely covered. His mouth still moving.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll always be with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
The dirt covers him. It continues to fill, until just the
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GLEAMING METAL HOOK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
waves futilely out of the dirt. Then, is stops wiggling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Julie goes to Ray.

EXT. HOTEL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray and Julie limp across the grounds of the hotel. They are moving past some shrubbery when
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A DARK FIGURE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
jumps out. Julie yells. She and Ray jump back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KARLA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stops in the middle of her kamikaze attack, knife held out.
</DIRECTION>
<KARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, god, it's you --

</KARLA>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're okay. Thank god.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<KARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARLA>
<DIRECTION>
They nod. They go to her -- jubilant group hug time. They compose themselves.
</DIRECTION>
<KARLA>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, it's true what they say about package vacations...You get what you pay for.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, how about we get off this piece of crap island.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARLA>
<DIRECTION>
The first rays of the morning sun appear. Ray looks adoringly at Julie as the beautific light catches her face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray kisses her. She kisses him back. They are silhouetted against a beautiful orange sunrise.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIE>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We don't have to tell anyone it rained the whole time. It can just be our little secret.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<DIRECTION>
The three of them throw their arms around each other's shoulders and they start walking for the beach as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A COAST GUARD HELICOPTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
rises into view.

SUPERTITLE: FOUR MONTHS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Julie pedals her bicycle down the street. She has a book bag over her shoulder. It feels like one of the first days of school.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She rides the bike up to a small house on the perfect street. She rolls the bike right up to the front door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Julie lets herself into the house. She leans her bike against another bike in the hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a perfect day. Birds CHIRPING. WIND in the willows. There's another NOISE...from inside her house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She goes perfectly still. And listens. Behind her, by the kitchen, the shadow of a FIGURE moves. She whirls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NOTHING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She creeps down the hallway toward her kitchen. She pauses --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dark figure almost knocks into her. She SCREAMS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's Ray. He's holding a disemboweled toaster.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ray...what are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<RAY>

	Oh...it's not working right. You're home early.

INT. STAIRWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Julie climbs to the top of the stairs. She passes Ray in the bathroom. She pauses in the doorway --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray is at the sink in boxer shorts. He's using an electric Waterpic devicice that has just been opened, a gift from the party. It makes a low WHIRRING sound.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
<DIRECTION>
(seeing her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Checking the locks again?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>

Julie smile and walks to the bedroom.

<DIRECTION>
INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Julie climbs into bed with a book. The bedroom is clean and orderly. The windows are closed. The closet door is shut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is decorated simply: a high antique bed; unopened boxes; a highboy; an antique mirror leaning against the wall. A stuffed bear sits in a chair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a CLATTER from another room. Julie freezes. She waits. She hears it again. She climbs out of bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SECOND BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Julie walks into the dark spare bedroom. The CLATTERING SOUND comes from the open window. The wind is blowing the blinds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Julie relaxes. She shuts the window. As she leaves the room, we notice the dirty imprint of a boot below the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Julie passes Ray who is still absorbed with the new toy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind him, the door softly closes. The lock twists. Ray is oblivious, happy being the dental-hygene pacesetter of the household.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Julie enters the room. She looks at the closet door. It is open a crack. She hesitates, trying to remember if it was open before -- it wasn't.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Julie approaches the closet. She catches her refelction in the mirror next to the closet. She peers into the crack of the closet. She can't see anything. She throws open the closet door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NOTHING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks around the room.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is my problem?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<DIRECTION>
She sits down on the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see her bare feet from under the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles, relaxes. She looks in the mirror leaning against the wall. Something has caught her eye. She freezes. She turns slowly back to the reflection in the mirror. She sees the glint of steel --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HOOK -- CRASH ZOOM INTO REFLECTION --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FISHERMAN CROUCHING UNDER HER BED
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Julie turns too late --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fisherman lunges out and grabs her legs. Julie screams. She goes down --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her nails scrape into the wooden floor as she is dragged under the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO BLACK: THE END
