INT. OFFICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A pretty secretary in her cubicle. LISA. A cute paperweight on her desk:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"LOVE IS .... NEVER HAVING TO SAY YOU'RE SORRY”
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She cradles the phone, whispering, not wanting to be overheard. In front of her sits a carry case for glass vials. Similar in design to the one we have already seen, but this one is empty. LISA toys with it nervously.
</DIRECTION>
<LISA>

</LISA>
<DIRECTION>
A fire alarm sounds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LISA almost jumps out of her skin. All around the worker bees look up from their computer screens. In an orderly fashion, they take their jackets from the backs of their seats and head for the door.

Been through this drill a hundred times before.

<DIRECTION>
Without warning the Halon system goes off. Pillars of high-pressure gas flood into the room, sucking the oxygen out of the air, making it impossible for a fire to breathe. A fire. Or people.

The worker bees begin to choke.

INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The stalled car is in the foreground. Beyond it, we see that the shaft is wide enough for another two elevators. Out here, the roaring sound is even louder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The roaring reaches a crescendo and the source of the noise races past in a blur. It's another elevator. In free—fall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside it, people are screaming.

GREEN and Blue struggle with the door. Without warning a chair bounces violently off the labs glass window, just missing GREEN. The glass isn't scratched.

BROWN hefts the axe and strikes the window with as much force as he can.

INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE LAB

The axe penetrates the glass. Just. A pea sized piece of glass pops out and bounces across the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OFFICE
</DIRECTION>

The Halon system switches itself off. The worker bees lie sprawled across the floor. Sprawled across their desks, Sprawled across one another. Not one moves.

INT. HALL WAY

<DIRECTION>
Three shiny steel doors stand at the centre of the hallway. Bodies are everywhere. Killed as they waited for an elevator.

The eerie silence is broken by a scratching sound. One of the elevator doors pops open an inch. Hands force their way out.

INT. HALLWAY

BLACK squeezes her head through the doors, She's a slim woman, but the gap between the elevator floor and the top of the doorway is also very narrow. Even if she gets out, she's going to have to drop six feet to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<BLACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm stuck .... you're going to have to push.

SMASH CUT TO:

<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP EYES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blue eyes snap open. Woken from a bad dream. WIDEN to reveal a woman's face to go with the eyes. It's not perfection, but it's close. We'll call her ALICE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEDROOM DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE sits up. Looks around. Four poster bed, oak paneled walls, painting of George Washington. Through the window she sees the ornate grounds of a manor house. There's even a maze. This could be the 19th maybe even 18th Century.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE steps out of bed. She's twenty one. Naked. I take it back, she is perfection.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Something tumbles from the bedclothes and lands on the floor. ALICE picks it up. A handwritten note:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"TODAY ALL YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE”
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE shakes her head. She moves through the room like someone who doesn't know where she is. She stops in front of a full length mirror. Stares at her own naked body. Touches it. Like it was all strange to her. Like she doesn't know who she is.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE stands before an ancient wooden dresser with three drawers. She opens them one at a time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The first contains crisp starched linens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The second, neatly ironed women's underwear. Very white, very conservative.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The third, a pair of Uzis with laser sighting, under-slung with miniature grenade launchers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE stares at the weaponry. The look on her face says it all. Who am I?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MANSION — ENTRANCE HALLWAY DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE descends a sweeping staircase. She's found some clothes. A tight pair of ski pants and a T—shirt. They fit like they're hers, but she can't remember ever having worn them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hallway is luxurious and tasteful. Tapestries and paintings of old relatives that ALICE doesn't recognize adorn the walls. But this isn't a quaint old house. There's something in the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Something intangible. Something evil.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MANSION - DINING ROOM DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The table is set for dinner, but there are no guests. No sign of life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Creepy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MANSION — STUDY DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A dark oak lined study. The only sound is the ticking of a grandfather clock. ALICE takes a framed photograph train the desk. It's of her and a handsome man. They are standing in front of rose bushes in the garden. He has his arm around her. He wears a wedding ring.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE looks at her own hand. She too wears a sample gold band. This man is her husband?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sudden shadow falls across the desk. ALICE jumps, startled. Something is moving out in the garden.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE seems surprised by the sound of her own voice. So that's what she sounds like.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MANSION — GARDENS - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE emerges from the study. In front of her is a huge marble statue. A series of bizarre gothic characters dancing round a maypole. A walrus wearing a waistcoat, a rabbit carrying a pocket watch, a bald beaded knight in armor. Both beautiful and also strangely unsettling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the distance, she sees movement at the entrance to the ornate hedge maze.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
But there's no reply. In the distance the sky is starting to darken.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MAZE - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE is following someone or something deeper and deeper into the maze. Dusk is turning rapidly to night, and the shadows within the maze are beginning to deepen. With every corner ALICE turns, the tension mounts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MAZE — CENTER - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE is about to turn back when she suddenly stumbles upon the middle of the maze. At the very center point is a chair. And in the chair, a man sitting with his back to her.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello.

</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
The man doesn't reply.

</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAMERA tracks around to reveal that she has her hand on the shoulder of a statue. ALICE sighs. With relief. With embarrassment. The statue is of an old man with a top bat in his lap. The hat has a price tag — "In This style 12/6”.

MATT and ALICE race through the house. Through the windows they can see the Darkwing squatting on the lawn. They are halfway to the entrance when the doors are almost blown off their hinges.

A dozen COMMANDOS stream in. A tight, disciplined group, dressed in black and armed to the teeth. If you find guns and body armor sexy, you just came.

They don't ask ALICE and MATT to get to the floor. They just knock them down. Within seconds MATT has been relieved of his badge and gun.

One of the COMMANDOS, TWELVE, slides an ancient oak panel to one side, revealing a computer jack point. He flips up the screen on his sleek wrist computer and jacks in.

ALICE listens carefully. It's barely audible, but it's there. A low groaning sound. It seems almost human. Almost.

INT. SPECIMEN ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWELVE punches in an access code — 667 — and a heavy steel door slides away to reveal a vast room filled with specimen tanks. The tanks are made of circular plexi and reach from floor to ceiling. There are literally hundreds of them, and with no clear way through the room, they form a grotesque kind of maze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Each tank is filled with a viscous liquid and some new exciting monstrosity. Animals spliced together. Skeletons that look barely human. Some that clearly aren't.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bioengineering run amok.

CLOSE ON ALICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as she wanders through the room. She sees human bodies stripped of their skin, just the bare musculature on show. Mesmerized by the freak show, she doesn't realize that she is being slowly separated from the others. This room does indeed function like a maze, and ALICE is becoming lost.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stops in front of one tank. It contains a strange four legged CREATURE with no eyes and a grotesque long tongue. Perhaps this was human once, but that was a long time ago.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The liquid the dead Creature is kept in is being constantly circulated, and the movement makes the three foot long tongue sway. It shines past the Plexiglas, as though it were licking it. Up close, the pink fleshy tongue is covered in a thousand tiny barbs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is the stuff of nightmares. Really fucked up nightmares. The kind serial killers have.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE looks away from the tank and realizes that the rest of the team have disappeared. She is alone in this grotesque maze. Where literally anything could be hiding. She suddenly senses movement. Something refracted through the curved glass of a specimen tank, Something horrifying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE turns and Bam! Comes face to face with ONE. ALICE tries to stifle a scream, but doesn't quite succeed.

After a moment the second screen reads:

The thin line of laser light streaks back towards them. This time it is just above ankle level, like a trip wire. Commando 2 tries to jump over it, but the laser adjusts, suddenly raising in height.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Commando 2 is caught off guard and sliced neatly in two. He stays conscious for a couple of seconds. Just long enough to see the horror of his own body falling apart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Only ONE has survived.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He has leaped into the air and stayed there, his feet braced against either wall of the corridor. The laser beam has passed right underneath him, only just missing. A knife that hangs from his belt is cut clean in two. The metal blade clatters to the steel floor below.

ONE stands his ground. Ready to pit his lightning reflexes against those of the computer. His concentration is absolute.

At the last second, the single thin laser wire switches to a grid. Fifty interlocking laser lines fanning a deadly net from which there is no escape.

For a second, inky darkness. Then the emergency lighting kicks in.

<DIRECTION>
This new menacing half light is accompanied by a heavy metallic pounding noise. Distant to start with, but gradually drawing closer. Like a giant's footsteps slowly approaching.

<TWELVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everybody stay close.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TWELVE>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE shoots him a look. That's one major piece of unneeded advice. TWELVE takes the lead as they head through the giant room. But the deeper they go, the greater the sense of unease. The specimens seem to be watching them. Leering at them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SUDDEN FLASH OF MOVEMENT. A glimpse of something hideous, seen through the curved glass of the specimen jars. Was it just a trick, a distortion of the glass, or is there something else in here with them?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unease becomes dread.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SPENCE slows. Almost stops. Without thinking, he's holding his breath. Just like the audience. We all sense it. Something terrible is about to happen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUDDENLY a clawed HAND on his neck. Digging in, biting into the flesh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SPENCE SCREAMS and turns to face the horror.

<SPENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is that?

ALICE and MATT share a look. This is the sane noise they had heard through the air vents. Only now it's closer. Now it's in the room with them.

<J_D>

J.D. pushes them towards the exit.
</DIRECTION>
<RAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	we're almost there .... keep going!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAIN>
<DIRECTION>
The exit is just ahead. Something big moves behind one of the tanks. S.D. lets loose a burst from his M16. The tank shatters sending broken plexi and fluid everywhere. They still haven't seen their pursuers.
</DIRECTION>
<J_D>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Run!
	</DIALOGUE>
</J_D>
<DIRECTION>
They do. ALICE sprinting ahead, straight into A figure in a lab coat. A WOMAN. Her tongue is swollen and bloated. Her death was painful and slow. You can see it in what's left of her face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE UNDEAD HAVE ARRIVED.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE screams as the UNDEAD WOMAN hinges at her. The Woman's actions are slow and jerky, but ALICE is caught by surprise and knocked to the ground. She struggles to get up, but the weight of the Undead Woman keeps her pinned to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE looks into the Woman's dead eyes, which stare straight back at her. There's no life left here, but there is something else. A terrible, terrible hunger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RAIN kicks the Woman off. She rolls over and begins to get up. Broken ribs mean nothing. Pain means nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RAIN empties a round into her chest. Then another, then another. Still the Woman advances. Bullets mean nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The M16 dry clicks. Empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWELVE moves to help when two more UNDEAD loom behind him. One grabs his arms, the other his hair. He struggles to break free, but can't.
</DIRECTION>
<TWELVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TWELVE>
<DIRECTION>
But J.D. can't hear over the sound of his own gunfire. He's blasting away at the rising tide of undead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE sits with her back against one of the tanks. In a state of shock. Traumatized.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE SEE but she doesn't — a figure moving behind the tank, circling towards her. Its monstrous face distorted even more by the coned Plexiglas.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RAIN struggles with the Undead Woman. Trying to hold her off. To keep the teeth from her throat.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
<DIRECTION>
(to Spence)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help them!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
MATT is helpless, his hands still cuffed. SPENCE surveys the scene. Sees ALICE in shock. TWELVE and RAIN pinned by the Undead. J.D. nowhere to be seen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he bolts for the exit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the Undead bites down hard on TWELVE'S shoulder. He screams in pain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RAIN struggles with the Undead Woman. She has RAIN by the hair.
</DIRECTION>
<RAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bitch!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAIN>
<DIRECTION>
RAIN grabs her by the head and twists. The UNDEAD'S neck snaps with a hollow crack and she falls to the ground. Unmoving.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The figure behind ALICE comes into view. She's still unaware of the danger. It's BROWN, the scientist from the start of the movie. The fire axe still dangles uselessly from his right hand. His face is bloated and swollen from the water. Death by drowning always looks bad. Especially when the bodies start to walk around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches for ALICE. His fingers are inches from her skin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two more Undead have surrounded TWELVE. The four of them have wrestled him to the ground and are biting in a frenzy at his arms and chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of them wrestles a .45 auto from TWELVE'S belt, but doesn't know what to do with it.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll take that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
Still in cuffs, MATT snatches the gun from the UNDEAD'S hand. The Undead creature looks up in surprise as MATT blows the back of its head off. Surprisingly, there's very little blood. Inside, the creatures are dry, withered husks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A scream brings cur attention back to ALICE. The Undead BROWN has a hand on her throat. He drops the fire axe and secures his other hand around her wind pipe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MATT carefully takes aim. BROWN'S head in his sights- And squeezes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Click. Empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE is slammed against the plexi tank. The last of her breath leaving her body. She's passing out. She feels BROWN'S saliva on her face. Rank and fetid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But still she doesn't move. The trauma has triggered some kind of recall in Mice's mind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BIG CLOSE UP ON ALICE'S EYES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly THE CAMERA accelerates forward, racing past the cool blue of her iris and plunging deep within the dark well of her pupil.

As THE CAMERA spirals through the darkness, we sense sudden flashes of color and sound. MEMORIES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE'S FLASHBACK:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blurred imagery, distorted voices. The logic of a dream.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAMERA lost in a dark, evil forest. The kind you see in fairy tales. But as we pull back, the forest is revealed to be a giant oil painting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In front of it stands a table. And on the table a foam lined carry case and a pair of gloves. We recognize them front the start of the movie.

SMASH CUT TO:

<DIRECTION>
THE PRESENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE forced against the plexi tank. BROWN'S hands around her neck, Choking. Dying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BAM! BROWN'S head is suddenly pinned against the Plexiglas by the fire axe. The axe has gone clear through his skull, in one ear and out the other. His hands drop away from ALICE'S throat, but BROWN'S body remains standing. His head pinned to the specimen tank.

They race for the exit. TWELVE seems badly injured. ALICE and SPENCE have to help him. Behind them, a dozen Undead are slowly following.

Up ahead they hear gunfire and moments later see J.D. by the exit, holding a whole band of undead at bay.

The door slides smoothly open to reveal...A DOZEN UNDEAD! Their hands reaching for RAIN. Grabbing her, dragging her into the dark void beyond.

<RAIN>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God! Help me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAIN>
<DIRECTION>
Other hands reach for her and try to drag her away from the undead. It's ALICE and TWELVE. Playing tug of war with the undead, and RAIN is the rope.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But it's hopeless and RAIN is dragged deeper into the ravening horde.
</DIRECTION>
<J_D>
	<DIALOGUE>

J.D. plunges into the doorway after her. His hand grabs hers, and for a moment she holds on.

J.D. finally snaps out of it. Realizing that RAIN is never coming back. Stunned, he nods and they move off.

The survivors race through the room, weaving between the slower moving undead. When something gets in their way, J.D. levels it with a burst from his M16. His anger rising.

for the first time, all alone in the dark. And it's terrifying. WIDEN to reveal –-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SECURITY ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We recognize the room from the start of the movie. The one with all the caged guard dogs. Only now the cages are empty. Many have holes in them, chewed straight through the mesh. What would make a dog do that?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE cautiously makes her way down the half lit corridor. Then suddenly she stops. Senses that she isn't alone. In the audience, people are watching from behind their fingers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then she hears it. A sharp clicking sound. Nails on a cement floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the shadows, a dark shape moving.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A low demonic growl.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Easy there I Good doggie.

The Doberman advances into a shaft of light. But this is like no dog we've ever seen before. Its eyes are glazed. Its flesh decaying. Undead doggie.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh hell.

</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
The Doberman charges and ALICE does the only sensible thing. She runs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Dog leaps at her, all teeth and claws. ALICE dodges and dives into one of the cages f or protection. She slams the mesh door in the hellhound's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE wedges door shut. She's trapped in the cage, and the door won't hold for long. But it doesn't matter anyway, because out of the shadows steps a second Doberman.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALREADY IN THE CAGE WITH HER!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The second Undead Dog jumps at ALICE, knocking her to the ground. She's no match for its savagery. It's a struggle just to keep its jaws from her throat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As if that weren't enough, the first Dog is slowly forcing the cage door open. It will be through in moments.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They want blood, her blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Dog on top of ALICE forces its jaws around her face.

THROUGH HER EYES WE SEE: schematics of the dog: biological cross sections: details of the dog's skeleton: a weak point identified on the Doberman's neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her hands are already there. Guided by instinct.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SNAP!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Undead Dog stops moving. She's killed it with her bare hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CRASH! The cage door bursts open. The other Dog charges. Ferocious, unstoppable. In one slick acrobatic move, ALICE leaps into the air and boosts herself through a hole in the cage roof.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Dog jumps after her, but ALICE is just out of reach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She rolls over the cage roof, drops to the ground and slams the cage door shut. Right in the Hellhound's face. ALICE slams the door bolt home. The Dog is trapped, helpless in the cage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE smiles and turns away, SMACK INTO ANOTHER OF THE UNDEAD!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's the security guard who used to tend the dogs. CLARENCE. We recognize him from the start of the movie. ALICE recognizes him from his name tag.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Easy there Clarence.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
The undead guard lunges for her, but ALICE is lightning fast, as though someone else had taken possession of her body. She weaves through his arm, lifts the sidearm from his bolster and drills a bullet through his forehead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the Undead Clarence collapses, MORE MEMORIES FLOOD INTO ALICE. In ULTRA FAST SUCCESSION we see a dozen schematics of the handgun. In two seconds flat, she has ejected the magazine, checked the number of bullets, slammed the mag home and chambered another round.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All before Clarence's body has hit the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE is stunned by all this sudden killer instinct. Stares at herself, gun in hand.

CLOSE ON A GUILLOTINE BLADE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the kind used for shying through thick stacks of paper. It comes down on a battered pair of handcuffs for the hundredth time. Finally a link breaks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDEN TO REVEAL –
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OFFICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MATT, now free from the cuffs, starts to make his way through the familiar office space. This is where we had last seen LISA. But now the place is trashed. Smeared with dirt and blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches LISA'S cubicle and sits down at her desk. We recognize the "LOVE IS .... ”NEVER HAVING TO SAY YOU'RE SORRY” paperweight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a moment he begins to methodically check the desk drawers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNSEEN P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
moving through the office space. Slow, jerky steps. Glimpsing MATT in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON MATT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as he turns, sensing something. There's someone in here with hint. MATT cranes his head around the side of the cubicle. Nothing there. He goes back to the desk and redoubles his efforts. He finds the foam lined carry case. Snaps it open. Empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNSEEN P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
closing in on MATT. He has his back to us. Trying to force open a locked drawer in LISA'S desk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON MATT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the locked drawer pops open. He rifles through the papers inside. All useless. Then he stops. He's found a framed picture. MATT and LISA arm in arm, smiling at the camera.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MATT gives the photograph a long look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CRASH!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
a sudden noise makes MATT turn. An office chair has been knocked over by the staggering monstrosity in front of him. It's LISA. Back from the dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MATT still holds the photo in his hand. The two of them arm in arm. LISA alive and beautiful. But the reality stands above him. LISA the undead. Her face distorted into a grotesque mask. The agony of suffocation.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh baby
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
LISA stares at him. Makes no attempt to attack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON HER EYES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
we see MATT reflected in her pupils. The undead LISA groans. Is there a hint of recognition?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly she raises her hand to his cheek. Touches him lightly. Tenderly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then sinks her nails into his flesh.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
<DIRECTION>
(in agony)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aaaaah!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
LISA lunges forward pushing MATT back over the desk. Her teeth snap at his throat. MATT fights back, but LISA is surprisingly strong. He slugs her across the face, breaking her teeth and his knuckles, but she doesn't flinch. Doesn't hesitate for a moment. She wants blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly, inevitably, she forces her mouth around MATT'S windpipe. Her broken teeth-ready to tear out a jagged chunk of raw flesh. When suddenly she stiffens. And then falls to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
To reveal ALICE standing behind her. The heavy "LOVE IS ...." paperweight in her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MATT struggles to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE looks down at LISA. This is the second time we've seen her die. Lying beside the body is the broken picture frame. MATT and LISA. Hand in hand. Smiling.
</DIRECTION>

</TWELVE>
<RED_QUEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Even in death, the human body still remains active. Hair and fingernails continue to grow, new cells are produced, and the brain itself holds a small electrical charge that takes months to dissipate. Much of the research in the Hive was devoted to those electronic signals left in the brain .... fragments of memory that decay over time. A virus, T—3 was developed. This T-virus provides a massive jolt to those trace electronic impulses.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Why develop such a thing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TWELVE>
<RED_QUEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To use as a weapon of course. Imagine it an enemy nation infected with T—3. The idea of having your own mother and father rise up out of the grave against you. To be attacked by your own flesh and blood. The psychological impact alone would be devastating.
	</DIALOGUE>

	If they're a weapon, you must be able to control them.
	</DIALOGUE>

<RED_QUEEN>

	When the enemy surrenders, the infected area would be sprayed with an anti-toxin, T-4.

<TWELVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that would kill them?
	</DIALOGUE>

It's hard to tell who's more shocked. ALICE and MATT, or TWELVE and the others. Maybe just the audience.

Both groups lower their guns.

From behind SPENCE walks a little girl dressed in red. She smiles at ALICE.

<RED_QUEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Hive.

</RED_QUEEN>

In 3D the underground complex bears an uncanny resemblance to a spiral of D.N.A.

</TWELVE>
<RED_QUEEN>

Five tiny red figures at the base of THE HIVE.

<SPENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right at the bottom...of course.

<RED_QUEEN>

She highlights a way through the holographic maze.
</DIRECTION>
<RED_QUEEN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Through the storage units on this level, to an access tunnel here. That will get you close to the surface. Then you'll only have to cut through the medical labs and you'll be back at the loading platform.

<TWELVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Queen has sensors throughout the Hive she can tell us where they are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TWELVE>
<RED_QUEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm afraid not. My primary sensors are thermal. Because the creatures are dead, their body temperature is negligible. To me they're virtually invisible.

</RED_QUEEN>
<SPENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great.
	</DIALOGUE>

<TWELVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TWELVE>
<RED_QUEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In case it had escaped your notice, so far today I've been attacked by a supercomputer, had the majority of my files corrupted and then scarcely thirty minutes ago, you yourself fired a uranium tipped shell clean through my main frame. It's been...stressful. So pardon me if I'm not functioning at full capacity.

In the centre of the maze, another red dot.

</RED_QUEEN>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Scrawny guy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
They stare at the softly pulsing heat signature. It gives nothing away. For now we will call him the STRANGER.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did he survive?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
The Red Queen seems genuinely surprised.
</DIRECTION>
<RED_QUEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't say. My termination methods were very methodical.

<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We should help him.

<SPENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forget it! He's miles away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPENCE>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE looks to MATT for support.

<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. We make a detour like that we may never get out.

INT. ACCESS TUNNEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A wide access tunnel over a mile in length. The HIVE really is vast. As they march, J.D. takes a pack from his belt and tosses it to ALICE.
</DIRECTION>
<J_D>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take one, pass the rest around.
	</DIALOGUE>
</J_D>
<DIRECTION>
She opens up the pack. Inside are a variety of k—rations. She tosses a bar to each of the others. MATT looks at the protein bar.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't eat this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't feel like eating either, but you have to keep your strength up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I mean I can't eat it. It has animal fat in it. I'm vergetarian.

He looks at MATT in disbelief.

	Now we ride in style.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPENCE>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO: ON BOARD THE CART
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SPENCE is at the wheel, J.D. riding shotgun. Mice, TWELVE and MATT jammed in the back. The walls of the tunnel race by. Above them a network of pipes and cables hang from the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SPENCE drives gleefully. A handful of undead are spread out sporadically along the corridor. He swerves to hit one of them. Sends it flying.
</DIRECTION>
<SPENCE>
<DIRECTION>
(laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I always wanted to drive one of these. I just couldn't stand the idea of golf.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPENCE>
<DIRECTION>
The Roadkill Undead tries to get to its feet. J.D. shoots it in the head as they race past.
</DIRECTION>
<J_D>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fore!
	</DIALOGUE>
</J_D>
<DIRECTION>
One of the undead manages to catch a hold of the side of the cart. He is immediately jerked off his feet and dragged along the ground. J.D. looks down at the hapless creature bumping along beside the cart.
</DIRECTION>
<J_D>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No riding ....
	</DIALOGUE>
</J_D>
<DIRECTION>
He waits until he has the UNDEAD'S attention. The monster stares up at J.D. with hungry eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<J_D>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	.... no riding. Without a ticket.
	</DIALOGUE>
</J_D>
<DIRECTION>
J.D. shoots him point blank in the hand. The UNDEAD'S fingers lose their grip and he slips away. The cart's back wheels bump as they run over his body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tunnel veers sharply to the left. SPENCE takes the 90 degree turn at high speed. He almost has the cart up on two wheels.
</DIRECTION>
<SPENCE>
<DIRECTION>
(enjoying every second)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeeeha!

</SPENCE>
<MATT>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How long is this tunnel anyway?

</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE takes out the Box and the Red Queen flickers into life.
</DIRECTION>
<RED_QUEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Enjoying the ride?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED_QUEEN>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We need to see the map again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
The holographic map of the hive appears above the Box.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're nearing the end of the tunnel. Round the next corner and you'll be there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look ....

</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
The red dot of the Stranger is also moving through THE HIVE, headed up.

<SPENCE>

</SPENCE>
<ALICE>

<RED_QUEEN>

(petulant)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps.

As we look closer, we can see the jagged edges of the holographic map, as though part of it has just been torn off. In fact it is disintegrating before our eyes.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't be expected to temember everything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED_QUEEN>
<DIRECTION>
MATT is about to question the Queen further when SPENCE takes another corner at high speed. The cart skids around the turn and SLAMS INTO A CROWD OF UNDEAD. DOZENS OF THEM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They're everywhere. Too many to avoid. SPENCE hauls the wheel to the left, but it's way too late, and they're going way too fast. The cart hits the crowd sending bodies flying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cart topples and overturns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MATT is the first to his feet. What he sees is a disaster. J.D. is pinned beneath the cart, unable to move. ALICE lies with her back to the tunnel wall, concussed and unmoving. SPENCE and TWELVE sit a few feet away, dazed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The undead are everywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get to your feet!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>

He grabs TWELVE and hauls him up.

The undead are closing in on J.D. Easy meat. He sees them coming and begins to panic.
</DIRECTION>
<J_D>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't move!
	</DIALOGUE>
</J_D>

His gun is lying on the ground. Just out of reach.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</J_D>
<DIRECTION>
MATT reaches for a gun, but he's lost his weaponry in the crash. He takes a .45 from SPENCE'S belt. He's still concussed. Doesn't need it.
</DIRECTION>
<J_D>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

	Get him off me .... get him off me!
	</DIALOGUE>

MATT and TWELVE race to his assistance, firing as they go. SPENCE hobbles along behind. They're just about managing to keep the undead at bay.
</DIRECTION>
<J_D>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My leg .... it's trapped under the cart.

	Again. One .... two .... heave!

</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
The cart crashes back onto its wheels. J.D. is free.
</DIRECTION>
<TWELVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's get out of here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TWELVE>
<DIRECTION>
He jumps into the driving seat of the cart. In the time it has taken them to free J.D., they have become completely surrounded. A solid wall of undead, getting closer and closer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON ALICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In all the confusion, everyone seems to have forgotten about her. She lies concussed, her back against the tunnel wall. Her eyes wide and staring, but seeing nothing. A group of undead have gathered around her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's dead meat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the undead drags his fingers through her hair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BIG CLOSE UP ON ALICE'S EYES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly THE CAMERA accelerates forward, racing past the cool blue of her iris and plunging deep within the dark well of her pupil.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As THE CAMERA spirals through the darkness, we sense sudden flashes of color and sound. MEMORIES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE'S FLASHBACK:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blurred Imagery distorted voices. The logic of a dream.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAMERA lost in a dark, evil forest. The kind you see in fairy tales. But as we pull back, the forest is revealed to be a giant oil painting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In front of it stands a table. And on the table a foam lined carry case and a pair of gloves. We recognize them from the start of the movie.

<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But there's going to be a price.

</ALICE>

END ALICE'S FLASHBACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SMASH CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE PRESENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDE ON ALICE AND THE UNDEAD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE lying like a limp rag doll. A dozen figures crowded around her, like an angry lunch line jostling for position. One undead with his hands in her hair. Another with her fingers already in his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly ALICE snaps back to life. Her eyes burning with a new found intensity. Her free hand comes up.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get the fuck off me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
With a startlingly professional movement, she snaps the neck of the Undead. Whatever skills have just returned, they're lethal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON THE GOLF CART
</DIRECTION>

The others are in trouble.

</TWELVE>
<DIRECTION>
The undead are everywhere. MATT, SPENCE and the bloodied J.D. keep firing, but nothing can hold back the tide.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The slide on J.D.'s automatic racks back and stays there. He's out of ammo. J.D. struggles to load another clip, but his injured hand makes it difficult. He fumbles and drops the spare mag. He stoops to retrieve it, and when he looks back up, he stares straight into a familiar face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The undead that was dragged behind the cart! His clothes are ripped and torn and covered in dark oily blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But he's back for J.D.
</DIRECTION>
<J_D>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</J_D>
<DIRECTION>
The Undead reaches for or J.D. He tries to fend it of f with his injured hand. But the Undead just grabs a hold of the bandages. With a smile on his face, he sinks his teeth into J.D.'s already wounded hand. The pain is unbearable.
</DIRECTION>
<J_D>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aaaaaah!
	</DIALOGUE>
</J_D>
<DIRECTION>
MATT turns, alerted by J.D.'s scream. He shoots the Undead and J.D. pushes it off his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MATT looks around. A sea of undead faces. It's hopeless. Then suddenly a miracle. The dead sea parts as ALICE carves her way through it. She ducks, she kicks, she weaves, she rolls. And everywhere she goes, things die.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got my memory back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In that case, what I said earlier .... I take it back. Whoever you are, I think we're going to get along just fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE'S sudden arrival has thrown the undead into confusion, but it won't last long.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can't stay here. There's too many of them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE looks around. They have to get out of here.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Above us!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
MATT looks up. He sees the network of pipes and cables hanging from the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	That's how we're getting out.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everyone up on the cart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
One by one they climb onto the broken roof of the golf cart. From there they can pull themselves up onto the overhanging pipes. There is an eighteen inch gap between the top of the pipes and the ceiling. Enough room to crawl along.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Down below, the undead reach for them, but their outstretched fingers can't quite touch the pipes. Ear the moment, they are safe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two of the undead try to climb onto the roof of the golf cart, but they don't have the coordination. The roof collapses, taking them with it.
</DIRECTION>
<J_D>
<DIRECTION>
(laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You dumb fucks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</J_D>
<DIRECTION>
He ties a fresh bandage around his hand. There's blood everywhere. It drops down onto the undead below, driving them into a frenzy. Like sharks circling their prey.
</DIRECTION>
<J_D>
<DIRECTION>

This is about to turn nasty, when ALICE interrupts.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>

</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
She stares the two men down.

<ALICE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	That's if you gentlemen have quite finished.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone can see the change in her character. She's icy cold. What no one else knows, is the reason why.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She caused all this.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE PIPES - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The team slowly work their way along the crawlspace. MATT is in the lead, followed by SPENCE and ALICE. J.D. then TWELVE bring up the rear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
J.D. is very pale. He's lost a lot of blood.
</DIRECTION>
<J_D>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need to rest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</J_D>
<DIRECTION>
He stops to catch his breath.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have to keep moving.

</ALICE>
<J_D>
<DIRECTION>
(still not moving)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How much further?
	</DIALOGUE>
</J_D>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	From what I remember of the map, not far.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<J_D>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you just switch on your little friend and ask her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</J_D>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE shakes her head.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want to use her unless we have to. Every time she seems to get less reliable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's definitely forgetting things.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>

<TWELVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's possible her memory was damaged when we shut her down and transferred her to the box
	</DIALOGUE>
</TWELVE>
<DIRECTION>
TWELVE is interrupted by an agonizing cry from below. A large crowd of undead have gathered beneath them. They seem more angry and aggressive than usual.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE glances at J.D.'s wound.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They can smell the blood.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
A hundred undead fingers reach out towards the live meat above them. Just a few tantalizing inches away.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's get going.

<J_D>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why worry? They can't get to us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</J_D>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just want to get out of here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
THE PIPES — LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They have almost reached the end of the tunnel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Below, the crowd of undead has become even larger and more unruly. As if they sense that they are about to lose their prey.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE points to something up ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the one we want.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
The network of pipes splits in two, one branch disappearing into a vent straight ahead, and a second smaller bundle of pipes veering off into a vent in the side wall.
</DIRECTION>
<MACE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Straight ahead. Just another hundred feet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACE>
<DIRECTION>
They pass the junction where the pipes split. Only another fifty feet to go. As before, MATT leads the way. S.D. and TWELVE bringing up the rear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Below, the undead are getting frantic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON A SUPPORT BRACKET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the metal brackets that hold the pipes to the ceiling. The bolts that fix the bracket to the rock are old and rusted. As MATT passes over this section, we see that one of the bolts is beginning to come loose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SPENCE is next. His body is heavier and the bolt begins to worm out of the rock. The whole support bracket is beginning to buckle.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The pipes go into some kind of air shaft.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
A mesh screen covers the entrance to the air shaft. MATT uses a knife to pries it away from the rock.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I can get the cover loose.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
The mesh screen pops off, a sharp edge cutting MATT'S hand.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
MATT lifts the screen away with his bloody hand and tosses it below. The undead scramble all over it. One sticks the mesh in his mouth to lick the traces of blood from it. The undead are working themselves into a frenzy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON THE RUSTED BOLT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As ALICE passes beneath it. The bolt is almost completely free of the rock. The whole bracket suddenly begins to sag.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
A harsh metallic Sound as the rusted bolt shoots free.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The supports .... they're coming loose!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
SPENCE and MATT are already safely in the air vent.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hurry! You've got to get of f there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE redoubles her efforts. J.D. and TWELVE are right behind her. But the faster they go, the greater the strain on the support brackets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BANG! BANG! BANG! Rusted metal bolts shoot free of the ceiling. Loud as gunshots.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A whole length of piping comes free and sags towards the undead. Now suddenly TWELVE, J.D. and ALICE are within reach. Undead fingers reach around their arms, their legs, their throats.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
(desperate)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
She struggles against them. MATT reaches out an arm to her, when CRASH! The whole section of piping finally gives way.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold on!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
MATT braces himself and keeps a hold of ALICE. He drags her slowly, painfully into the air shaft and safety.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But there's no one to help TWELVE and J.D.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
J.D. tumbles off the pipes and is dragged under by a sea of undead. His ME firing wildly as he is sucked down.
</DIRECTION>
<J_D>
<DIRECTION>
(screaming)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck you! Fuck you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</J_D>
<DIRECTION>
The undead rip at his flesh, bite into his limbs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But still he keeps fighting. Screaming and shooting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Undead bodies are flung through the air by the force of the 2416. And when that's out of ammo, J.D. begins to blaze away with a .45 automatic, until finally the others can lift him to safety.
</DIRECTION>
<J_D>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aaaaaaaah!
	</DIALOGUE>
</J_D>
<DIRECTION>
He's safe, but badly mauled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON TWELVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
also in trouble, but near to a fallen section of piping. He begins to drag himself back up to safety, the undead literally hanging off him.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep them off him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE and the others lay down a blanket of covering fire. His legs no longer work, but TWELVE pulls himself back towards the roof with sheer force of will.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just keep them away from him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
The others blaze away, keeping the tide of undead at bay. Just.
</DIRECTION>
<TWELVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh God ....
	</DIALOGUE>
</TWELVE>
<DIRECTION>
TWELVE collapses at the top of the pipes. He's back near the roof now, but separated from the others by a twenty foot section of fallen piping. It may as well be the Grand Canyon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The only way for him to go is back.
</DIRECTION>
<TWELVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't feel my legs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TWELVE>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll get to you somehow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<TWELVE>
	<DIALOGUE>

He shakes his head. Suddenly determined.

	<DIALOGUE>
	You go.

</TWELVE>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're not leaving you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<TWELVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes you are. Already the undead are climbing the fallen section of pipe.
	</DIALOGUE>
<TWELVE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't kill them all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TWELVE>
<DIRECTION>
He looks down at his ravaged body.
</DIRECTION>
<TWELVE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I'm not going anywhere.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TWELVE>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twelve ....
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
There are tears in her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<TWELVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want you to go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TWELVE>
<DIRECTION>
She shakes her head.
</DIRECTION>
<TWELVE>
<DIRECTION>
(con't) (Firm)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now! MATT takes ALICE by the arm. He knows what has to be done.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TWELVE>
<TWELVE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd) (shouts)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just do it now .... Go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TWELVE>
<DIRECTION>
TWELVE watches his friends disappear into the gloom of the air vent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Below him, a pair of undead are climbing the fallen pipe. Their once crisp lab coats are streaked with dirt and blood. We recognize them as the scientists from the start of the movie. BLUE and GREEN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLUE is leading the way. A hungry look in his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<TWELVE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just you and me ugly. TWELVE checks his handgun. Just one shell left.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TWELVE>
<TWELVE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's lucky.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TWELVE>
<DIRECTION>
BLUE is almost upon him. Undead hands reaching out. TWELVE puts the gun into his own mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to breathe short, angry breaths. He's keying himself up, getting ready to pull the trigger. To escape the horror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLUE has his hands on TWELVE, his undead fingers covered in fresh blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWELVE closes his eyes. His finger tightens on the trigger. INT. WIDE AIR VENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE, MATT and SPENCE stop when they hear the single shot echo down the air shaft. They know what it means.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE hangs her head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her tears glisten in the half light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ACCESS TUNNEL — PIPES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLUE falls from the overhanging pipes, a fresh bullet hole bored neatly between his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<TWELVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TWELVE>
<DIRECTION>
TWELVE holds the smoking gun in his hand. Still very much alive. He used the last bullet on the undead, not himself.
</DIRECTION>
<TWELVE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not going out that easy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TWELVE>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at the undead climbing the pipe towards bin.
</DIRECTION>
<TWELVE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd) (defiant)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're going to have to work for your supper.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TWELVE>
<DIRECTION>
Behind him, the network of pipes splits in two. One running back down the length of the access tunnel, the way they came. The other disappearing into a small air vent in the side wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NARROW AIR SHAFT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWELVE pulls the mesh screen aside and drags himself into the vent. This is much narrower than the one the others escaped into.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tight, claustrophobic, terrifying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SPENCE begins to crawl away from the pipes. Every movement is agony. He leaves a trail of fresh blood behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON GREEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she enters the air shaft.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NARROW AIR SHAFT – VENTLATION FAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A large metal fan blocks TWELVE'S progress. Its sharp steel blades spin at high speed, forcing air down the shaft. There's no way around it, and no way through it.
</DIRECTION>
<TWELVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TWELVE>
<DIRECTION>
TWELVE looks back down the shaft. Around the corner, he can see the shadow of GREEN. No way forward and no way back. He's trapped.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWELVE fumbles through his utility belt. Finds his laptop. He glances at the spinning metal blades.
</DIRECTION>
<TWELVE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here goes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TWELVE>
<DIRECTION>
He tries to force the laptop between the blades. The blades spark and begin to chop away at the computer. He pushes harder. Shreds of plastic and microchip and flung back at him. TWELVE pushes harder still.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And suddenly the fan stops. The laptop has lodged between the blades, jamming the mechanism.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWELVE glances at the mangled remains of his computer. The most expensive door stop ever.
</DIRECTION>
<TWELVE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you Bill Gates.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TWELVE>
<DIRECTION>
Behind him, GREEN makes a noise. Excited. She smells fresh meat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWELVE begins to drag himself between the sharp metal blades of the fan. GREEN is right on his tail.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her fingers reach for his legs. TWELVE pulls himself faster. In his haste, he dislodges the laptop slightly. The steel blades move a fraction. The laptop groans under the strain. It's going to be crushed at any moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWELVE is clear of the blades. GREEN follows him. The laptop splinters and begins to crack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GREEN is half way through the blades.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CRACK! The laptop is split clean in two.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The blades spin back to life, slicing neatly through GREEN. Her legs are suddenly no longer attached to her body.
</DIRECTION>
<TWELVE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd) (laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TWELVE>
<DIRECTION>
GREEN looks down at her legs, and then back up at TWELVE. She drags her torso towards him. Oblivious to anything but the fresh meat up ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<TWELVE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh shit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TWELVE>
<DIRECTION>
TWELVE begins to haul himself away. But his progress is blocked. The air shaft takes a sharp 90 degree turn. STRAIGHT DOWN. There's no way to climb down there, and no end in sight. The shaft seems to drop forever.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GREEN growls. A Low animal noise. She senses that she has her prey trapped.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWELVE fumbles in his utility belt again. His hands finds a grenade. It's slick with blood. His own.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He glances back at GREEN. The legless monstrosity is still coming forward. An unearthly light in her green eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<TWELVE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Screw you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TWELVE>
<DIRECTION>
TWELVE throws the grenade back at GREEN. It bounces and rolls, then hits her squarely in the forehead. GREEN stops. Picks up the grenade. Smells it. Smells the blood. Then begins to lick hungrily at it. She tries to force it in her mouth and
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE GRENADE EXPLODES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GREEN is vaporized. But TWELVE has no time for celebration. The explosion races up the confines of the air shaft.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The blast hits him like a tidal wave. Searing his flesh and flinging him backwards. He is hurled against the far wall of the shaft and then drops like a stone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Into the depths.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A deserted hallway. Nothing moves, but still we hear something. A low scratching noise. Like rats running behind the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Without warning, there is the muffled burst of automatic gunfire and a section of the roof collapses. Pipes and plaster fall to the floor, followed by MATT and ALICE. SPENCE brings up the rear, propping up a near dead J.D.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE looks around, getting her bearings.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Follow me. Not far to go now.

INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE LAB
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The three survivors pass the lab where we had first met GREEN, BROWN and BLUE. ALICE points ahead.

<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This way to the entrance. We're almost there.

	<DIALOGUE>
	So?

</ALICE>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So .... we have to find it. It's evidence. Of what they were doing down here
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No way. We should keep going. Get to the surface.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
MATT can't understand her reluctance. But how could he? How could anyone else know she is implicated?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HARD CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LAB
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The same lab we had seen at the start of the movie. But now the place is a mess. ALICE looks around, uneasy.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is a mistake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
MATT places The Box on a lab table. The Red Queen flickers back to life. But now her image seems faint, Strangely distorted. Something is wrong.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You okay?

<SPENCE>

<SPENCE>

	Let's just get on with it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPENCE>
<MATT>

	No wait. 24.7 degrees, yes, yes, that's it. 24.7 degrees.

The computer's memory is clearly fading fast.

<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON FREEZER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as MATT opens the door. Inside are two racks, one marked T-3, the other T—4. Both racks are empty.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't understand.

We realize that we have seen this all before. At the start of the movie, when the gloved hands were emptying the freezer.

BIG CLOSE UP ON SPENCE'S EYES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly THE CAMERA accelerates forward, racing past the iris and plunging deep within the dark well of his pupil.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As THE CAMERA spirals through the darkness, we sense sudden flashes of color and sound. MEMORIES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SPENCE'S FLASHBACK:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blurred imagery, distorted voices. The logic of a dream.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAMERA lost in a dark, evil forest. The kind you see in fairy tales. But as we pull back, the forest is revealed to be a giant oil painting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In front of it stands a table. And on the table a foam lined carry case and a pair of gloves. We recognize them from the start of the movie.
</DIRECTION>
<UNSEEN_VOICE>

THE CAMERA PANS to reveal who LISA is talking to. The Unseen Voice belongs to ALICE.

<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>

</ALICE>

She and LISA stand in front of a giant oil painting in the entrance hallway of Looking Glass house

<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have to guarantee me .... you'll bring the Corporation down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAMERA TRACKS BACK at warp speed, to reveal SPENCE. Standing at a distance. Unseen. Listening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE IMAGE SUDDENLY DISTORTS, MORPHING INTO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MANSION — ALICE'S BEDROOM DAWN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SPENCE looks down on ALICE, still asleep in bed. He finishes writing out a note and then places it by her sleeping form -— "TODAY ALL YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE”
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON GLASS VIALS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
being lifted from the lab refrigerator. Gloved bands slip them into a foam lined carry case. The vials are delicate. Filled with a cool blue liquid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hands move quickly. Urgently. A repeat of the first image we saw in the movie. Only now we PULL BACK to reveal that the gloved bands belong to SPENCE. He is standing in the lab as it used to be. Clean, pristine. Before the horror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON GLASS VIALS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the last one is lifted from the refrigerator. But in his haste, SPENCE lets the vial slip. The delicate glass tube tumbles end over end. And crashes to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON THE FLOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
covered in shards of glass and blue liquid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON SPENCE

looking down at the floor in horror.

END OF FLASHBACK:

SPENCE steps through the doors. They close behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MATT makes to follow. We hear the deadened sound of automatic gunfire through the steel doors. SPENCE can be seen through the thick glass window as he heads off down the corridor -

MATT struggles with the door, but it won't budge.

SPENCE hurries down the corridor. Up ahead he can see the main entrance to THE HIVE. Beyond it the cavern and the elevator platform.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's home free. INT. LAB
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Red Queen brings up the holographic floor plan. We see SPENCE'S heat signature moving towards the exit. But another signature is closing in on him. The Stranger.
</DIRECTION>
<RED_QUEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look. It's got his scent already.

INT. UNDERGROUND CAVERN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SPENCE leaves THE HIVE and crosses the cavern. He passes by the underground river and the spot where they had first discovered him hours earlier.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches the platform and busies himself with the controls. Ready to return to the mansion and safety.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LAB
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the holographic map, the two heat signatures meet. And merge.

INT. UNDERGROUND CAVERN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The elevator platform comes to life. The hydraulics start to power up. Blood drips into a pool at SPENCE'S feet.
</DIRECTION>
<SPENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What ....
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPENCE>
<DIRECTION>
SPENCE looks up to the ceiling. Hanging there is The Stranger. But it's not the 120 pound male the Red Queen had described. Instead it is THE CREATURE that ALICE had found so unnerving in the Specimen Room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
300 pounds of pure evil.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Four claw like talons dig into the rock face, holding it in place. Its long fleshy tongue uncoils, snaking down towards its prey. We see the razor sharp barbs that cover the tongue's grotesque length.
</DIRECTION>
<SPENCE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck me ....
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPENCE>
<DIRECTION>
As if to oblige, THE CREATURE drops from the ceiling. Its tongue lashes out, the razor barbs tearing SPENCE'S clothes and gouging into the flesh beneath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SPENCE'S screams are cut short as THE CREATURE leaps forward and begins to devour hint whole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SPENCE goes into shock and passes out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then suddenly, without warning, THE CREATURE dashes forward. Lightning fast. STRAIGHT INTO CAMERA.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In search of new prey.

ALICE, J.D. and MATT listen as the Red Queen casually fills them in on their executioner.

</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
The Red Queen doesn't reply.

<J_D>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were going to let that thing finish us off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED_QUEEN>
<DIRECTION>
BAM! A sudden noise SCARES THE SHIT out of them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CREATURE is right there at the window.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The fucker's got no eyes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
THE CREATURE moves to the cluster of small holes that BROWN had punched in the glass with his fire axe. The tip of its grotesque long tongue snakes through one of the narrow holes. It sways back and forth.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
(whispered)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's sensing the air. It can smell us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
THE CREATURE withdraws its tongue, then backs away from the glass.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's it doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly THE CREATURE races at them. Hurling its whole body weight against the window. The glass quivers, but holds.
</DIRECTION>
<J_D>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not getting through there. That glass is bullet proof.
	</DIALOGUE>
</J_D>
<DIRECTION>
THE CREATURE tries again. Hurling itself even harder at the window. And again it is repulsed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But small spider web cracks have begun to appear in the glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE and MATT race through the abandoned hallway. They carry J.D. between them. They're going back the way they came. Back into THE HIVE.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is hopeless. It's got us cut off from the exit. All we're doing is going deeper.

THE CREATURE continues to pound against the door behind them. Its talons punching through the metal.

BAM! The door behind them has almost given way. THE CREATURE'S tongue pokes through a hole in the metal and lashes around the room.

MATT desperately looks around. Four solid walls, no air vents, no way out.
</DIRECTION>

INT. UNDERGROUND CAVERN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE and MATT exit THE HIVE, carrying J.D. between them. TWELVE limps behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They cross the cavern to the elevator platform. Lying by the controls is the skeletal remnants of SPENCE. He still clutches a machine pistol uselessly in his hand. Lying by the body is the carry case containing the T—virus and its antidote. flattered but still intact. ALICE picks it up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MATT lays J.D. on the platform. TWELVE busies himself with the controls.

<MATT>

</TWELVE>
<DIRECTION>
The platform begins to vibrate with energy. ALICE kneels by what remains of SPENCE'S body. She slips the wedding ring off his finger. Just like Mice's, it bears the same inscription:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"PROPERTY OF UMBRELLA CORP.”
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She slips the ring into her pocket.

THE CREATURE FALLING from the ceiling without warning.

LANDING RIGHT ON ALICE! You can barely hear her cry of pain and surprise above the SCREAMS OF THE AUDIENCE.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
MATT races forward, but is sideswiped by THE CREATURE'S tongue. He is flung through the air and crashes into the side of the platform. He lies still, like a broken doll.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CREATURE'S mouth opens to reveal row upon row of teeth. This thing is built to kill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It rears triumphant above ALICE. We see it from her P.O.V. The tongue retracts, leaving THE CREATURE free to feast upon her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As THE CREATURE takes its first bite
</DIRECTION>
<THE_SUDDEN_NOISE_OF_MACHINE_GUN_FIRE_IS_DEAFENING>

With the last of his strength, J.D. throws her the combat knife from his belt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON THE KNIFE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as it arcs through the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CREATURE charges forward again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The controls of the platform read "FULL POWER”.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
(pain)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aaaaah!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE cries out in agony as THE CREATURE'S deadly tongue lashes past her. She twists her body so that it scrapes down her left arm, lacerating, but not killing. The tongue smashes into the platform's floor, the sharp barbs digging into the ornate wooden tiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON THE KNIFE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as ALICE catches it and in one seamless move drives it straight through the hideous tongue, pinning it to the platform's floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CREATURE screams. A terrifying inhuman Sound.
</DIRECTION>
<TWELVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Going up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TWELVE>
<DIRECTION>
He hits the controls and the platform begins to rise into the air. THE CREATURE is dragged toward the ceiling, its body banging off the platform, but held in place by its pinned tongue. Its limbs flail helplessly in the air.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Die you fucker!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
A second later, the platform disappears into the shaft. Cutting THE CREATURE'S tongue from its body.

THE CREATURE screams in unholy agony and then is gone.

THE CREATURE'S severed tongue is left pinned to the floor of the platform. Still writhing with a life of its own, but pinned firmly in place by J.D.'s knife.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>

</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
The battered box containing the T-virus and its antidote hangs from her belt. She breaks it open, reaches for a shot of the antidote.
</DIRECTION>
<J_D>

</J_D>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE nods. And J.D.'s eyes slowly close. His head sinks to his chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE lets out a cry. But J.D. doesn't move.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly, shakily, she raises the gun. Her vision is blurred with tears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The muzzle of the gun is an inch from J.D.s head. Her finger tightens on the trigger, but still she can't fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THEN SUDDENLY, J.D.'s hand shoots up! Grabbing her arm. ALICE screams in shock I

	</DIALOGUE>
</J_D>
<DIRECTION>
He eases the revolver back into his belt. In the background, TWELVE and MATT are laughing. Despite the shock, ALICE can't help it. She begins to laugh too.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A TALON SUDDENLY PUNCHES THROUGH THE FLOOR!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Almost impaling MATT. Missing his torso by inches, but slicing through his left leg.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
<DIRECTION>
(in pain)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aaaaaah!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
THE CREATURE has lodged itself beneath the platform. Its talons are pulling apart the floor. Peeling it like a grape.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get over! Get over to the other side of the platform!

THE CREATURE is partially onto the platform. Fighting to drag its bulk through the jagged hole.

<TWELVE>

But THE CREATURE is almost through.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dammit! We're not going to make it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE races over to the platform controls. She punches them furiously. The platform slows to a halt. They are still a good seventy feet from the mansion.
</DIRECTION>
<TWELVE>
<DIRECTION>
(incredulous)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell are you doing I

She nods over to two steel ladders recessed into the wall of the shaft.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to put the platform into free fall. Now get going!

TWELVE staggers to the emergency ladders as MATT helps J.D. onto the first rung.

</MATT>
<J_D>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't!
	</DIALOGUE>
</J_D>
<DIRECTION>
THE CREATURE'S talons slash out at J.D., missing him by inches. It strains to reach bin, its back leg still caught in the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Climb damn it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly, painfully, J.D. begins to climb.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hurry!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
MATT boosts TWELVE onto the ladders, then turns to ALICE.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Send this fucker back to hell!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE punches in the command code.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Done.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
The platform begins to drop away, back into the depths.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE makes a jump for the ladders, just as THE CREATURE frees itself from the floor and makes a leap for her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON A TALON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as it snags ALICE'S foot.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
(agony)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aaaaah!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE nearly loses her grip on the ladder.
</DIRECTION>
<NATT>

He turns to J.D.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give me the gun. Your gun!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
MATT reaches for the revolver on J.D.s belt, just as J.D. turns to face him, his face contorted in a death mask. His eyes burning with unholy life. HE'S ONE OF THE UNDEAD NOW!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
J.D. lunges at MATT, his teeth snapping at the warm flesh. MATT struggles to fight him off!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON ALICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as she looks up, sees MATT in trouble, but can do nothing. THE CREATURE begins to claw its way up her body. ALICE screams in pain. She's holding their combined body weight. Every movement THE CREATURE makes is agony.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON THE CREATURE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as it tightens its grip on ALICE. It's going to drag them both to their deaths.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON THE UNDEAD J.D.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
his inhuman eyes, his gaping mouth. His undead hands all over MATT, clawing at his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MATT struggles with J.D. He has one finger on the revolver at J.D.s belt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON THE CREATURE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as its jaws snap at ALICE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON ALICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
to reveal her fist, filled with vials of T—4, the T—virus antidote. She jams them into the jaws of THE CREATURE. The vials break and spill liquid everywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The antidote reacts with THE CREATURE as though it were acid. The inside of its mouth begins to bubble and burn. Its skin cracking and popping.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON MATT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as he finally gets his hand on J.D.'s gun. But J.D. lunges at MATT'S exposed throat. They both overbalance and begin to fall. MATT'S reflexes save him, but the undead J.D. isn't as fast. He pitches off the ladder and plunges to his death. Again.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
But his cry isn't for J.D. It's for the gun, which slips from his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON THE REVOLVER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as it spins through the air. Its fall suddenly arrested by a hand. She catches it, and in one deft move, turns it on THE CREATURE.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Back to hell with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON THE BULLET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as it races from within the gun. We see the rifling of the barrel race past us and then track through the open air as the bullet flies towards THE CREATURE'S head. We are inches behind it as the bullet tears into THE CREATURE, cracking through its armored hide, already weakened by the T-4.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAMERA plunges into the entry wound and plows through THE CREATURE'S skull and brain matter. All the time following the bullet, until finally emerging into the blinding light again through the exit wound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON THE CREATURE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as slowly, painfully, it loses its grip on ALICE and pitches back into the depths.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PLATFORM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Far below, the walls are begin to whip past faster and faster. The empty platform is accelerating to incredible speeds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAVERN DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The platform crashes into the cave floor at over 200 m.p.h. Broken rock, splintered wood and twisted metal fly everywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON THE CREATURE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as it tumbles through the air, its agonized howls are brought to an abrupt halt as it hits —-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE REMANTS OF THE PLATFORM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A huge broken shard of wooden flooring impales THE CREATURE. Its own body weight dragging it down the jagged shaft. THE CREATURE spasms and the last breath leaves its twisted body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
What is left of THE CREATURE hangs a few feet above the floor of the wrecked platform, dripping the dark oily substance that passes far its blood. An explosion of bones and organs. Some recognizably human, some not.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON A PIECE OF PAPER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as it drifts slowly through the air. It had fallen from ALICE'S pocket during the struggle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We follow the paper until eventually it lands on the bizarre remnants of THE CREATURE. As slime and ooze soak through the paper, it unfolds, to reveal the words:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"TODAY ALL YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE”
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MANSION - ENTRANCE HALLWAY DAWN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MATT appears at the lip of the shaft. Hauls himself onto the mansion floor.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>

	What the hell did you do to that thing?

</MATT>
<ALICE>
<DIRECTION>

ALICE emerges, and then drags TWELVE from the open shaft.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She said the Creature was the product of the same genetic material as the undead. So I figured the antidote would effect it harm it in some way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
TWELVE groans. His head bus to one side. Near exhaustion, but still hanging on.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'd better get him to a hospital.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
They hoist TWELVE between them and head for the mansion door.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
<DIRECTION>
(shakes his head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hell of a night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
Just as ALICE'S hand reaches for the door, the wrist alarm on TWELVE'S left hand goes off. A shrill beeping noise. The digital wrist clock flashes: 00:00:00
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MANSION - STEPS - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE swings open the mansion door. But instead of a fresh breeze and a brand new dawn, they find themselves still inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The whole mansion has been tented out! Contained within a viral perimeter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sudden banks of bright lights kick in, blinding the survivors. Gloved hands reach for, them. Faceless TECHNICIANS hidden beneath monstrous anti-viral suits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From one horror to another!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DARKWING HELICOPTER DAWN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE is bundled into the back of the Darkwing. The door slams behind her, and she finds herself staring into the reflective visor of a clean suit. No sign of a face beneath, just her own reflection.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's Matt? What about Twelve?

The stretcher holding TWELVE is loaded into the craft.
</DIRECTION>
<MEDIC>

	Secure!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEDIC>
<DIRECTION>
As the Darkwing begins to take off, a team of MEDICS race to save TWELVE'S life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIC 2 Jesus he's a mess.

<DIRECTION>
MEDIC 3 Vitals are plunging!

<DIRECTION>
MEDIC 1 50 cc's of adrenaline!

MEDIC 2

He's going flatline.

TWELVE'S eyes flicker and then close.
</DIRECTION>
<CHIEF_MEDIC>

	Come on goddamn it!

</CHIEF_MEDIC>
<DIRECTION>
The CHIEF MEDIC rips his mask off.

<CHIEF_MEDIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck protocol! I'm not going to let this man die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHIEF_MEDIC>
<DIRECTION>
The Chief Medic begins to give TWELVE mouth to mouth. If anyone can save him, this man can. He has GEORGE CLOONEY written all over him.

<CHIEF_MEDIC>

<DIRECTION>
The Chief Medic's lips touch TWELVE'S for the last time, when suddenly THE PATIENT'S EYES SPRING OPEN. TWELVE is back to life, but not the way they had intended.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The doctor screams as the newly undead TWELVE lunges at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SMASH CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP EYES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blue eyes snap open. Woken from a bad dream. WIDEN to reveal a woman's face to go with the eyes. It's not perfection, but it's close.

<DIRECTION>
Wait a second. Haven't we been here before?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER STILL TO REVEAL:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE CELL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
White on white. Padded walls and an electronically locked door. ALICE lies on the floor. Coming round.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She squints. The bright white light hurts her eyes. Even her hospital gown is crisp starched white.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
High above, out of reach, a smoked glass window. A light comes on behind it to reveal four figures. THE INTERROGATORS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERROGATOR 1 What happened in the hive?

<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who are you people? Where am I?

INT. THE CELL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE lies on the bare floor. White on white.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A siren wakes her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The light behind the smoked glass window comes on. The INTERROGATORS are revealed once more.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERROGATOR 1 What happened in the Hive?

<DIRECTION>
INTERROGATOR 2 What happened in the Hive?
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Screw you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
The light behind the smoked glass window dims. The INTERROGATORS disappear from view.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE CELL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE sits in the corner, her back against the wall. White on white.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She has no idea if it is night or day.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She has no idea how long she's been here.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A day? A week? A month?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stares at the white label on her white hospital gown. It bears the logo of the UMBRELLA CORPORATION.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The siren sounds again. ALICE looks up as the light behind the smoked glass window comes on. But The INTERROGATORS are nowhere to be seen. Their seats are empty. Instead, a half lit figure moves behind the glass. It seems unsteady on its feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON ALICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as she hears a terrifyingly familiar sound. A low groaning noise. It seems almost human. Almost.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At that moment, the electronic look by the door clicks from red to green. The padded cell door swings open an inch. No telling what horror waits outside. But what choice does she have?
</DIRECTION>
<EXT_CORRIDOR_OUTSIDE_THE_CELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The same bright white on white. A corridor stretching off into infinity. ALICE nervously peers around the door. Straight into the face of

</ALICE>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some kind of Umbrella facility.

</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
She gazes down the endless white corridor. No sign of life.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And where is everyone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
SUDDENLY a figure steps into the foreground. It scares MATT and ALICE almost as much as it does us.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>

	You're okay!

Before them stands a familiar holographic teenage girl. Only now she is dressed all in white.

	No.

<DIRECTION>
There is a sadness in her voice.

<WHITE_QUEEN>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you're mistaking me for my sister. I didn't understand what my she was trying to do. I helped kill her.

<DIRECTION>
The young girl looks imploringly at ALICE. Is it possible? Is this computer seeking forgiveness?
</DIRECTION>
<WHITE_QUEEN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was wrong.
	</DIALOGUE>

They are interrupted by distant gunfire. The screams of the dying.

<WHITE_QUEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The infection spreads to cover the United States within 13 days .... Canada and South America in 27 days .... Worldwide infection in less than two months.

DISSOLVE TO:

<DIRECTION>
Blue eyes snap open. Waken from a bad dream. WIDEN to reveal a woman's face to go with the eyes. It's not perfection, but it's close.
</DIRECTION>

ALICE sits up with a start. She is in bed. Naked. The scars from THE HIVE are old now. A good six months must have passed.

MATT (O.S.)

You okay?

<DIRECTION>
WIDER TO REVEAL
</DIRECTION>

the interior of a big R.V. ALICE is in the back on the fold­out bed. MATT is up front, driving. The rent—a—cop uniform is gone, replaced with jeans and a black sweater. And guns. Lots of guns.

	How we doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Almost there. Another ten, twelve miles.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
As ALICE pulls on some clothes, she looks around the familiar cramped interior of the R.V. She smiles at the piles of "Guns and Ammo” magazines. She clearly shares this place with MATT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CEMETERY - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A huge urban graveyard. Thousands were once buried here.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But now all the graves have been dug up. From within.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the distance, movement. An R.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RECREATIONAL VEHICLE - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the R.V. races past, we see that it has been heavily modified. Thick metal plating covers most of the windows, and a gun turret has been added to the roof.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A serious piece of post apocalyptic hardware.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RECREATIONAL VEHICLE - FRONT SEATS DUSK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE, now dressed, sits down beside MATT. His hands rest on the steering wheel. We notice that he wears a gold band on his left hand. The one SPENCE had once worn. The twin of ALICE'S.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I keep thinking about the Hive- You think we could have done things differently? Stopped them there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doubtful. But it's a nice thought.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
She looks out through the windshield. We still haven't seen where they're going.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Almost there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
She turns back to MATT.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think we'll find anyone alive?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CITY STREET - DUSK The R.V. cruises down a street lined with abandoned cars and trucks. No drivers, no passengers, no pedestrians. MATT and ALICE are the only one alive here.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Brinks armored car lies on its side. A strongbox spills $100 bills out into the street. They flutter idly In the wind. EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DUSK The R.V. races over the deserted bridge, headed for Manhattan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAMERA CRANES UP to reveal the New York skyline. Both familiar, yet terrifyingly different. For now there is no movement, no lights, no sign of life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sun sinks beneath the tall buildings, and the tiny R.V. is swallowed by the silent city.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MATT and ALICE will return in:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RESIDENT EVIL: APOCALYPSE
</DIRECTION>
