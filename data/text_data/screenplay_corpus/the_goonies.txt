</Guard>
<DIRECTION>
Guard walks down to an open cell where the expected inmate has not emerged. He walks in and discovers that the inmate, Jake Fratelli, has apparently hung himself. There is a note taped to his chest reading, "To whom it may concern". The guard removes it, turns it over and reads the back.

Francis now reaches down through the open passenger side window and fires into the now gasoline-soaked pavement. A ring of fire flares up around the entrance, trapping the jail guards who have hastily emerged looking for Jake. Francis laughs victoriously. Mama Fratelli puts the car in gear and screeches away. A number of police cars quickly pursue them.

He is obsessed with following the map; his eyes constantly glance to it. Up ahead is the Stop 'N Snack, a popular teenage hangout. Mouth, Chunk, and Data turn their bikes toward the Stop 'N Snack while Mikey continues forward. He suddenly stops, realizing that the others have left him.

Back at the Stop 'N Snack, an elderly, obese woman, Sylvia Keester is working at the check-out counter. Data is purchasing a pack of baseball cards. Sylvia rings up the order on the electronic cash register. It jams and Sylvia pounds the machine, frustrated. Data opens a small panel on the register and begins to fiddle with two small wires.

Mouth stands by the magazine rack. A sly look in his eyes, he slips a copy of "Playboy" behind a copy of "OMNI", and begins to look through its gallery.
</DIRECTION>

Chunk is over by a rack of junk food. He looks around, and noticing that the coast is clear, hurriedly tears open a Twinkie. He quickly slurps out the Twinkie's cream filling, rewrapping the now-hollow Twinkie, and placing it back on the shelf.

Mikey enters the store. He rushes over to Chunk and waves the map in Chunk's face.

Mikey takes a puff from his inhaler. He grabs a copy of "Mad" magazine, and as always, guesses the "fold-in". He suddenly notices something. On the lower magazine rack there is a section of dusty "Cauldron Point" tourist maps. Mikey grabs one of the maps and opens it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile, Chunk has made his way to the frozen treat freezer. He opens the freezer door and pokes his head deeply inside. Out of sight, he opens a container of Häagen Dazs ice cream. He takes a few licks from the top and then quickly closes the lid. He grabs another container; he is going to sample everything!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Data still fiddles with the cash register. It suddenly beeps and lights. It's working again, good as new. Sylvia gives a satisfied ruffle to Data's hair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sitting on the floor, Mikey has opened the tourist map and the old museum map. He has laid them side by side and is comparing the two. He notices that the coastline paths of both maps are identical. Several key landforms, rocks and cliffs, also match. His eyes are bright and hopeful.

Troy Perkins, the rich, spoiled brat son of Elgin Perkins, who dropped off the papers earlier, struts in like he owns the place. He is seventeen years old, tan, and cocky. He is dressed in a white Polo tennis outfit with expensive tennis shoes. He is from the "Hillside" neighborhood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andi is walking beside Troy. She is sixteen years old with the face of an angel. Smooth, creamy complexion, her thick, bright red hair falling to her shoulders. Her bright green eyes are dazzling. She is slender and filled with energy: a beauty. She is well-dressed in an light coloured three-piece outfit, somewhat similar to her cheerleading outfit: pale yellow short-sleeved shirt, long, white V-neck vest, and an off-white wrap-around style mini-skirt. She has borrowed Troy's yellow school sweater; his name printed on it. Andi also lives in the Hillside district.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beside Andi is her best friend Stef, also age sixteen. Stef is short and pudgy, with dark brown hair and glasses. She is wearing Denim fisherman coveralls. She is tough, quick-witted, and bright. And she lives in the Goon Docks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Troy walks straight to the magazine rack. He grabs the "Playboy" magazine from Mouth and begins to page through it. Mouth glares at Troy, so angry that he has been rendered speechless. He backs off and picks up another magazine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mikey sees Andi: a vision. He stares at her with adoring eyes. Stef and Mouth do not get along. They exchange a glance and Stef crinkles her nose.

She turns. Troy is holding up the "Playboy" centerfold. Written about the photo, in large red letters are the words, "Can you measure up?" He gives a lecherous grin to Andi.
</DIRECTION>
<Troy>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you measure up?

Andi smiles, giving a casual, brotherly ruffle to Mikey's hair. Mikey smiles, in heaven. Meanwhile, Chunk still has his head buried in the freezer. Troy notices, and walks over. He brings the freezer door down on Chunk's head, trapping him in the freezer. Chunk panics, Troy chuckles.

	</DIALOGUE>
</Troy>
<DIRECTION>
Troy towers over Mikey. He's ready to hit Mikey, when he notices the ancient map resting on the floor. He realizes that it is important to Mikey. He turns from Mikey and grabs the old map. Mikey claws at Troy.
</DIRECTION>
<Mikey>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let go. That's art you're messin' with.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mikey>
<DIRECTION>
Troy holds the map high in the air, above Mikey's reach. Troy is confused by the map, but he realizes its importance to the boys. He grabs a pack of cigarette tobacco from the counter and pours it out onto the map. He then begins to roll the map like a huge cigarette.
</DIRECTION>
<Troy>
<DIRECTION>
(Giving a evil grin to the boys)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just can't get rolling papers like this anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Troy>
<DIRECTION>
Mikey tries to grab the map, but Troy gives him a hard shove, knocking Mikey to the floor. Troy finishes rolling the large "cigarette". He removes a butane lighter from his pocket. Flick, a large flame appears. Troy moves the flame to the end of the "cigarette" and lights up! The boys watch in horror as Troy takes a long puff. The end of the map burns and crinkles. Mikey hides his eyes. Troy blows out smoke rings and gives a relieved sigh. A few more puffs and the map will be destroyed! Troy takes another long puff. Mouth walks up. He raises his eyebrow, doing his Jack Nicholson impersonation.
</DIRECTION>
<Mouth>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ya know, the way you're puffing on that cigarette...it reminds me of somethin'.

<DIRECTION>
Troy's eyes fill with murder; he drops the map, leaping for Mouth. Mikey quickly grabs the map, stomping out the fire. Troy has tackled Mouth. He is throwing punches; Mouth covers his face. Mikey leaps onto Troy, grabbing him around the neck and trying to pull him off Mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the background, Data tries to help Mikey. He opens his shirt and pulls a cord.
</DIRECTION>
<Data>
<DIRECTION>
(Shouting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Smoke screen!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Data>
<DIRECTION>
A rubber garden hose shoots out of Data's sleeve. But instead of emitting a steady stream of smoke, the hose slowly smolders. Data holds his arm in pain, as if it were on fire. He run to an ice machine and buries his arm into the ice! A smile of relief covers his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile, Troy is busy defending himself against Mikey. Troy turns and grabs Mikey with his left hand. He pulls back his right hand, ready to punch Mikey in the face. But as Troy's hand flies toward Mikey, it is suddenly grabbed, stopped in mid-air by another hand. Brand has grabbed ahold of Troy's wrist.
</DIRECTION>
<Brand>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nobody hits my brother except me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Brand>
<DIRECTION>
Afraid of Brand, Troy gets off Mikey. The boys are relieved. Brand grabs Troy by the shirt, ready to fight. Troy looks away, scared, while Mikey watches, his eyes beaming with pride. Brand releases his grip on Troy. Troy stands up, and forcing a cocky grin, he looks at all of the Goonies.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our court time starts in five minutes. I'll be waiting outside.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Troy>
<DIRECTION>
Andi gives a nonchalant shrug. Brand turns to Andi, shooting her a jealous look. Troy struts out of the Stop 'n Snack. Through the window we see him get into his bright red Mustang convertible.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mikey has unrolled the map. It has survived the burning with only a tiny singed edge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brand and Andi's eyes meet, a look of tragic desire! They want to be together, but this isn't the time. She flashes her pretty eyes...Brand sort of melts down. He turns to Mikey, grabbing the map and slapping Mikey's head.
</DIRECTION>
<Brand>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mom's waiting for you. You just blew your whole life, pal.

With that, Brand tucks the map into his back pocket. Mouth walks up to Brand, turns on the phony charm and puts his arm around Brand.

Mouth turns to the other Goonies and shows them the map. They make a run for it. A befuddled Brand reaches into his back pocket, realizing that the map is gone. He runs after the kids.

Mikey, Mouth, Data, and Chunk hurriedly ride off on their bikes, Mouth holding the rolled up map under his arm. Brand dashes outside, in time to see the boys ride off into the distance.

:SC: Mikey explores the basement
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mikey pulls out the map and unrolls it as he steps down into the basement. It is dark, musty, and very damp; water is dripping in many places. Mikey bangs his head on a hanging lightbulb as he reaches the bottom of the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<Mikey>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know you're down here, One-eyed Willy. You gotta be down here. I can feel it, One-eyed Willy. I know you're down here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Passes the washroom; it's very smelly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh man, that stinks!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Hears a roar, like that of a lion)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell was that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mikey>
<DIRECTION>
Another roar, a bit softer than before. Through a partially open door Mikey sees a hideous creature, like a big ogre. It's back is turned to Mikey and he notices that it is chained to the wall! Jake is in there with the creature, singing to it in Italian. The creature is growling at Jake! Mikey watches for a moment, curious, in morbid fascination. Another growl from the ogre-like creature interrupts Jake's aria.
</DIRECTION>
<Jake>
<DIRECTION>
(Hits the creature, Mikey winces at the cruelty)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're ruinin' it. You're ruinin' it. See the feast I made ya?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Points to a dinner plate on the floor)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at the feast I made ya. You wanna eat it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Throws a piece of food at the creature)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here, have some.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Jake>
<DIRECTION>
Mikey glances at the dinner plate. It isn't very scrumptious, more like scraps one might give a dog. Jake, holding a few food scraps in his hand, continues pelting them at the poor creature's face. Mikey shudders, hardly able to watch such intense cruelty, especially when he notices that the creature is attempting to shield its face with its hands.
</DIRECTION>
<Jake>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on. Go ahead, you'll get something.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Turns to leave the room)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't leave me any choice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Jake>
<DIRECTION>
As Jake is leaving, Mikey hurriedly sits behind the door. He curls up in the darkness, hoping Jake won't see him.
</DIRECTION>
<Jake>
<DIRECTION>
(Now at the door, looking back)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't leave me any choice!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Closes the door)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're just like Mom and Francis. You never let me finish anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Jake>
<DIRECTION>
With the door closed, Mikey is almost in plain sight...if Jake were to only turn his head. A nervous Mikey slinks further back into the darkness, hoping that Jake won't see him. Mikey hears the creature, now alone saying something. It sounds like a cry for mercy, although to him, the words are unintelligible.
</DIRECTION>
<Creature>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Creature>
<DIRECTION>
Jake sings some more, through the closed door.
</DIRECTION>
<Jake>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Una fortiva la gremark...
	</DIALOGUE>
</Jake>
<DIRECTION>
A mousetrap snaps on Mikey's behind. Mikey grits his teeth, clenches his eyes, and manages to keep quiet. Jake doesn't notice him; he disappears upstairs. Mikey relaxes and pulls the mousetrap off his pants. The creature cries some more in frustration, yanking at its chains.
</DIRECTION>
<Creature>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Food! Ah! Ah! Hungry! Hungry! Food, please!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Creature>
<DIRECTION>
Mikey opens the door slightly to take a better look. He notices that the dinner plate is out of the creature's reach. He realizes that this poor creature must be hungry and that it is trying to beg for food. Mikey is unable to walk away without showing a little compassion. A broom is nearby. Mikey picks it up and uses the long handle to push the plate into the creature's reach. Although the creature continues to groan, it hears the scraping sound of the plate on the floor. It turns to face Mikey.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The creature is, in fact, a large man, but with a grossly distorted face. He growls at Mikey, who in fear, drops the broom handle. The man picks up the dinner plate, now within his reach. He laughs hideously, in triumph as he hoists it up to his mouth. Mikey runs out of the basement, terrified.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he reaches the top of the stairs he is suddenly grabbed from behind, a hand clasped over his mouth. Mikey panics, trying to scream, but it is Brand, who has finally caught up with them.
</DIRECTION>
<Brand>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mikey, why can't you stay at home. Let's get out of here right now. Let's get out of here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Brand>
<DIRECTION>
Brand hauls Mikey over to the door. The other three Goonies follow them out. Mama Fratelli chases them out.
</DIRECTION>
<Mama_F>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get out of here! And stay out!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Slams the door)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mama Fratelli leans back against the closed door and breathes a sigh of relief, now that they're gone.

Out by the rocks in front of the restaurant, where they hid before, the group has reassembled. Mikey is trying desperately to tell them about the strange man he saw in the basement.

Mama Fratelli comes out with Jake and Francis. They are carrying a large, bulky object in a black bag out to the ORV. Chunk sees them.

Chunk furiously charges Mouth like a rhino. Mouth, expecting this reaction, neatly steps aside, allowing Chunk to crash into the door instead. The impact of body his breaks it open. Chunk is left lying on the floor. The others step over him.

:SC: Chunk, the Determined Hero
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dusk has fallen. Chunk has escaped from the Fratelli's basement and is scrambling through the woods, coming to a road. He's still nervous from his near-call with the Fratellis and does not enjoy groping through the woods in the dark. He is relieved at finally getting to the road...if he can just stop a car to get a lift to the sheriff station.
</DIRECTION>
<Chunk>

	I'm not afraid of the dark. I like the dark. I love the dark, but I hate nature. I hate nature.

Chunk sees another car coming. He steps out in the road and waves his arms.

The car stops. Chunk runs over to the driver's side, out of breath, but bold and serious.

</Driver>
<Chunk>

	Look, mister, I need a ride. My friends and I just had a run-in with these really disgusting people; you might have heard of them: the Fratellis. Well, we found their hideout, and could you please, please take me to the sheriff station. I can describe all three of 'em.

	Gas pipes...drainage... Maybe...wait a minute, guys! Shut up for a minute. Okay, lookit. These pipes must lead to a building or something: a foundation. So maybe if bang on 'em hard enough,

Everybody starts yelling and banging, even yanking on the pipes. Up above, it is the Country Club!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A slightly overweight, balding old fellow exits a tennis court, greets a friend and leans over to a drinking fountain. But as he leans, the fountain lurches down, and further down toward the ground. He tries to lean down with it, but then it suddenly springs up, hitting him in the face and knocking him over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Over in the men's shower, several of these old coots are about to wash. As one guy reaches for the faucet, it suddenly bursts back through the tiles. Another man is about to touch a pair of valves and they also burst back through the tiles, as well as all the other valves in the shower room!
</DIRECTION>

Finally Troy: whistling a bit to himself, he walks into a toilet stall, drops his pants and takes a seat. He is browsing through a copy of "Guns 'n Ammo" magazine.

The skeletal remains of a body lie half buried in the dirt with bugs crawling over the skull and out of the eye sockets. They all shreik with fright at the gruesome find. Andi screams, initially with sudden fright then, snapping back to reality, her face turns rubbery, eyes wide open as she screams out her accumulated terror.

Oddly enough, the large boulder that Mouth is standing next to has a chain wrapped around it! Mouth is actually holding the chain, and nobody notices that this is, to say the least, odd.

	Hey guys, now that we've got...
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mikey>
<DIRECTION>
Mikey finds a very suspicious wire mostly concealed by the sand on the cave floor. He pulls it up slowly out of the sand. Mikey believes that it is probably a trip wire for a booby trap.
</DIRECTION>
<Mikey>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at this. You see what I found?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mikey>
<DIRECTION>
Mikey has pulled that wire a little too far. A gentle tug was all that was required to start a mechanical chain reaction. Mikey drops the wire and freezes, afraid to make another move. A large scathe is swinging back and forth, its blade cutting a rope.
</DIRECTION>
<Mikey>

	Guys, freeze. Don't move. Don't move.

The group runs forward. Data takes cover in what he thinks is a safe spot. He glances up and sees another rock dangling above his head.
</DIRECTION>
<Data>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holy S-H-I-T!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Jumps off the rock and runs down the tunnel toward the others)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The first of the boulders crashes to the ground. Data races to safety with another boulder falling behind him. They all jump over a small ledge for cover as several of these huge boulders fall in sequence. Mikey darts out quickly to rescue the lantern before the final boulder comes crashing down.

The rock isn't overly heavy. Brand rolls it aside.
</DIRECTION>
<Stef>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Brand, God put that rock there for a purpose, and, um, and I'm not so sure you should, um, move it, or something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Stef>
<DIRECTION>
A fine "squeaking" sound is heard from inside the now open cave. Brand calls into it.
</DIRECTION>
<Brand>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello? A huge barage of disturbed bats flutters out of the cave, seeking the exit tunnel. They flutter in everyone's faces; both girls are screaming. Everyone is waving their hands over their faces to keep the bats away.

(Whispering to himself) Chester Copperpot...Chester Copperpot... (Out loud, to the rest) Chester Copperpot! Don't you guys see? Don't you realize? He was a pro. He never made it this far. Look how far we've come. We've got a chance.
</DIRECTION>
<Andi>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chance at what, Mikey? Getting killed? Look, if we keep going someone's really gonna get hurt, maybe dead. Besides, we gotta get to the police.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Andi>
<Mikey>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe Chunk already got to the police.

<Andi>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe Chunk is dead.

	Don't say that. Never say that. Goonies never say "die".

<Andi>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not a Goonie. I wanna go home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Andi>
<Mikey>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I forgot. But still...don't you realize? The next time we see sky it'll be over another town. The next time you take a test, it'll be in some other school. Our parents, they want the bestest stuff for us. But right now they gotta do what's right for them, 'cause it's their time. Their time, up there. Down here it's our time. It's our time down here. That's all over the second we ride up "Troy's bucket".
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mikey>
<DIRECTION>
Mikey pauses. He gives a long hard look at everyone. They look at each other, remembering what their quest represents. Andi, for the first time, is now beginning to understand their drive. Mikes takes a puff and continues.
</DIRECTION>
<Mikey>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, a couple years ago, my Mom and Dad got on that big game show. Remember, Brand? Mom spent a month makin' those funny costumes. She was a giant egg. Dad was a frying pan. My Dad kept sayin' we were gonna live in a place called "Easy Street". So we drove all the way to Hollywood. When we got there, they put us in this big audience, with all these other people in funny costumes. Then some dude with lipstick and sprayed hair came down the stairs. He walks up to us. First he makes Mom guess how much toilet bowl cleaner costs; she gets it right. Then he makes my Dad guess what a jar of Ragu Spaghetti sauce weighs; he gets it right. Then he asks my Dad "The Big Prize is behind Door #1? Door #2? or Door #3?" Now my Dad's Lucky Number was always "2". He got married on August Two. He got his job on June Two. And he's got two kids...
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mikey>
<Data>
<DIRECTION>
(Getting impatient with the long story)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Okay. We got the point! He took Door #2!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Data>
<Mikey>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. That's the weird part. For some reason, he took Door #3. So the game show guy screams, "Congratulations! You've just won...ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND..."
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the door swings open. And this huge glass jar is sittin' in the middle of the stage...filled with TOOTHPICKS. "One hundred thousand toothpicks."
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mikey>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone listens, intersted. Troy shouts from above.
</DIRECTION>
<Troy>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey Andi!! You comin' or not!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Troy>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls the rope. Andi pulls back, lingering for another moment, fascinated by Mikey's story.
</DIRECTION>
<Mikey>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everybody in the place was laughin'. Even Mom and Dad smiled. But I could see on their faces, they knew. They were never gonna live on Easy Street. They blew their chance.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(To the others)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is it guys...On Monday, all our living rooms turn into golf holes. This is our last chance. I mean...I'd feel like a real jerk if some guy like Troy dug up all the rich stuff, 'cause we were too chickenshit to go for it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mikey>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone looks at each other. How can they argue? They're going for the treasure! Troy again shouts from above.
</DIRECTION>
<Troy>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Andi, you wanna' stay down there with the Goonies? Or are you comin' up here where you belong? I ain't got all night!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Troy>
<DIRECTION>
Andi pauses, turning to the others. They stare at Andi, waiting for her decision.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Troy begins to pull the bucket and rope. It is heavy. Troy gives a victorious smile to his friends. The bucket arrives at the top of the well. Troy is met with a shocking sight: the bucket is wearing his letter sweater. Troy grabs the sweater; the bucket is filled with pebbles and rocks. His friends chuckle. Troy stares in disbelief at the bucket. Frustrated, he shouts into the well.
</DIRECTION>
<Troy>

Andi looks at her arm. There are countless tiny, black, slimy leeches covering her arm! The kids panic. Everyone is covered with the little bloodsuckers. They dash out of the water!

:SC: Chunk, Sloth, and Baby Ruth
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
So, the beastly man is really a third son of Mama Fratelli's! Sloth, as they call him, is hideously deformed. He sits there in his chair, arms manacled to the wall by a pair of long chains. Gazing at his TV screen, a cooking show is on, demonstrating the frosting of a lucious chocolate cake. Sloth and Chunk are both hungry and they share a love for chocolate.
</DIRECTION>
<Show_Host>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Spread it around. Try to make your frosting look a little bit rugged.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Show_Host>
<Sloth>
<DIRECTION>
(Hungering and longing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chocolate? Ha ha. Chocolate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Sloth>
<Chunk>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Want a candy bar?

<Show_Host>
	<DIALOGUE>

</Show_Host>
<Chunk>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I got a Baby Ruth.

(Pulls it from his pocket)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir?

</Chunk>
<Sloth>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh, huh. Wha? Ahh? Ruth..Ruth..Ruth..Baby Ruth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Sloth>
<Chunk>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm gonna throw it to you, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Chunk>
<DIRECTION>
Chunk's arms are tied to the arms of the chair. With some difficulty he tears open the wrapper and does the best he can to throw it to Sloth. But all the movement Chunk can muster is a flick of his wrist. The candy bar bounces off Sloth's forehead and lands on the floor just out of his reach. Sloth appears angry that this has happened and Chunk's eyes widen in fear, not knowing how Sloth will react.
</DIRECTION>
<Sloth>
<DIRECTION>
(Frustrated)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ahh!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Sloth>
<Chunk>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aaaaaagh!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Tries to hobble his chair over to pick it up for Sloth)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sloth tries desperately to reach for the candy bar, but the chains stop his hands short. He cannot reach it and grows more frustrated.
</DIRECTION>
<Sloth>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aaagh!

</Sloth>
<Chunk>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, sir. I tried to give it to you. Oh, I'm sorry.

</Sloth>
<Chunk>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Chunk>
<DIRECTION>
Sloth focuses his strength on one chain and pulls with all his might. The chain's anchor bolt breaks away from the plaster wall. He tries for the candy bar and still can't reach it, so, wildly driven, obsessed, he concentrates his full weight into the other chain. With some effort it too breaks free. He finally picks up the candy bar in delightful victory. He delicately unfurls the wrapper.
</DIRECTION>
<Sloth>
<DIRECTION>
(Satisfied)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey? Ha.

:SC: Data's Ingenius Solution to the Leeches
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The kids are covered with leeches! They are in a frenzy and helpless. Andi tries to shake the leeches from her arms and fingers. Brand tries to pull off the leeches. Mikey tries to dance off the leeches. But nothing works. The leeches are stuck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Data thinks fast. Opening his yellow vinyl blanket, He removes a medium sized, 20 volt battery! He hurriedly connects two wires to the battery. Data runs to the edge of the water pool. Keeping his feet in the shallow section, he inserts the ends of the battery wires into the water. A low voltage shock surges through Data and the leeches fall off his body, electrocuted. Data motions for the others to join him. As each person steps into the water, Data inserts the two wires. A success. The device removes the leeches from everyone. Only Andi and Stef remain. Andy steps into the water. She gets her electric shock. A smile slowly appears on her face. Her knees buckle, weak. She emits a sigh, followed by a tiny squeal. The same thing happens to Stef. Once they're out of the water, she whispers to Andi.
</DIRECTION>
<Stef>
<DIRECTION>
(To Andi)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got all tingly.

<DIRECTION>
But Andi feels violated by this.
</DIRECTION>
<Andi>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's responsible for that?!?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Andi>
<DIRECTION>
Andi looks at Data, who is rolling up the two electrical wires. Data victoriously smiles and wiggles his eyebrows suggestively. Andy slaps Data across the face. This causes a chain reaction on Data's booby trapped body. A tiny GI Joe doll pops out of Data's shirt and fires a single shot plastic projectile at Andi. The GI Joe goes back down inside of Data's shirt, not unlike a cuckoo clock. Andi rolls her eyes.
</DIRECTION>

:SC: The Fratellis Find Chester Copperpot

Now past the water pipes and into the main tunnel system, the Fratellis have set off the firecracker "boody traps" that Data left behind.

<DIRECTION>
Just past Data's "boody traps" are the fallen boulders. The Fratellis have to climb over them, but Mama is having a hard time. An agonized scream is heard as Jake tries to pull Mama over the top of a boulder while Francis pushes from behind. The lady is spread-eagled over the huge rock as the two boys struggle hard.
</DIRECTION>

Francis gives a mighty shove up on Mama's behind as she lurches forward with a roar. Mama instantly slaps Jake in the face!

At the front of the fallen boulders they come across Chester Copperpot's remains. Jake picks up the empty wallet that Mikey had left.

</Sloth>
<DIRECTION>
Sloth is huge, and the impact of his enormous hand caused Chunk to fall over backwards. Sloth finds this a bit funny, but Chunk is too stunned to say anything. Sloth rocks the chair back upright with a single hand. Chunk is nervous because he doesn't know what else is going to happen to him. But Sloth ever so gently peels back more of the candy bar wrapper and feeds it to Chunk. They enjoy the candy bar together. Then, Sloth suddenly becomes excited about his new-found friend. He shouts for joy and picks up the chair with Chunk in it. Chunk's response is must more fearful. But Sloth is happy; he plants a big kiss on Chunk. He laughs with delight, but Chunk is repelled by Sloth's offensive odour.

	</DIALOGUE>
</Stef>
<DIRECTION>
The cannon ball passes over Andi, Stef, and Brand. Andi follows it with her eyes as it passes, then looks back in fright with a gasp.
</DIRECTION>
<Mikey>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mikey>
<Mouth>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God! It's gonna fall on us or something!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mouth>
<Mikey>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's another one of Willy's tricks. Get out of the way!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mikey>
<Data>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Data>
<DIRECTION>
The cannonball falls off the end of its track around the room. Landing in a net it yanks a rope causing the floor beneath Data's feet to collapse. Data disappears into the cave floor.
</DIRECTION>
<Data>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aaaaaagh!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Data>
<Andi>
<DIRECTION>
(Leaping forward)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Data!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Andi>
<DIRECTION>
While falling, Data instinctively yanks on a cord on his sleeve. A pair of false teeth on a long spring leap out of his sleeve and catch on a rock. The spring is strong enough to break his fall, which would have been onto long pointed stakes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The others, horrified that he may be lost forever, crowd around the opening, looking for any sign of him.
</DIRECTION>
<Andi>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Data!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Andi>
<Mikey>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Data!

</Mikey>
<Brand>

</Brand>
<Mouth>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Data!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mouth>
<Mikey>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Data, please!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mikey>
<Mouth>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's gone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mouth>
<Andi>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, no...
	</DIALOGUE>
</Andi>
<Mouth>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's really truly gone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mouth>
<Andi>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Andi>
<DIRECTION>
Data, meanwhile, dangles safely above some jagged stalagmites from the spring that is attached to his "Pinchers of Peril".
</DIRECTION>
<Data>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pinchers of Peril! You guys, I've been saved by my Pinchers of Peril!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Data>
<DIRECTION>
The group hears his shouts and rejoices.
</DIRECTION>
<Goonies>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's alive! He's alive!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Goonies>
<DIRECTION>
Data, the near tragedy averted, looks around his new location with interest.
</DIRECTION>
<Data>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guys, I'm in another room!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Data>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: Chunk tries to tell all to the Sheriff and gets Started with Sloth
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chunk and Sloth have freed themselves and Chunk has found a phone in which to call the Sheriff. Sloth, meanwhile, is rummaging through the cooler.
</DIRECTION>
<Chunk>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Sheriff? I'm at the old Lighthouse Lounge and I want to, and I want to report, ah...a murder.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Chunk>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sheriff
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Just hold on here. Is that you again, Lawrence?
</DIRECTION>
<Chunk>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sheriff, look. This time I'm telling you the truth. I'm locked inside the Fratelli's basement with this guy...
	</DIALOGUE>
</Chunk>
<DIRECTION>
Sloth emerges from the cooler with a container of ice cream.
</DIRECTION>
<Sloth>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rocky Road, heh heh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Sloth>
<DIRECTION>
The Sheriff has heard Chunk's "stories" before and isn't taking him too seriously.
</DIRECTION>
<Sheriff>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, like the time you told me about the fifty Iranian terrorists who took over all the Sizzler Steak houses in the city?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Sheriff>
<DIRECTION>
Sloth, however, is now interested in the tunnel under the fireplace. Chunk tries to stop him while staying on the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<Chunk>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sloth, get back here. Sloth, what are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Chunk>
<Sheriff>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just like that last prank about all those little creatures that multiply when you throw water on 'em?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Sheriff>
<DIRECTION>
While trying to stop Sloth, Chunk has stretched the phone cord over to the fireplace, but Sloth is already starting to climb in.
</DIRECTION>
<Chunk>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sloth! Sloth! We're not going in the fireplace.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Chunk>
<DIRECTION>
Now Chunk's phone cord breaks from the wall and the Sheriff is cut off with a dial tone.
</DIRECTION>
<Sheriff>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lawrence?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Sheriff>
<DIRECTION>
Sloth is a bit frightened by the echoing of his own voice in the tunnel.
</DIRECTION>
<Chunk>
<DIRECTION>
(Trying to explain)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No Sloth, it's just your echo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Chunk>
<Sloth>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Echo!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(echoing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(more echoing)
</DIRECTION>
<Chunk>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No Sloth, I'll show you. Don't go down there. It's all dark down there, Sloth. It's your echo, Sloth. Echo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Chunk>
