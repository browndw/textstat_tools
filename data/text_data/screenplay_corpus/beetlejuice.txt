EXT. WINTER RIVER, CONNECTICUT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A crisp and perfect New England town. Almost too neat to be real. No visible townspeople. CAMERA EXPLORES town.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA FLIES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
over a rickety bridge -- PAST the Maitland Hardware and Appliance store -- PAST the church -- the Historical Society -- UP over the graveyard on the hill and finally --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
To the Maitland house. The perfect Victorian house surveying the tiny village. Suddenly --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A GIANT DADDY LONGLEGS SPIDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
mounts the crest of the hill beside the house, pauses to wave a spindly leg and then creeps menacingly on top of the Maitland house.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S..)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, well, you're a big fella...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
A hand -- as big as God's -- with a huge tweezer, gently reaches down out of the sky and lies, palm up, in the yard next to the house. Daddy Longlegs climbs into it. The hand rises into the sky again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ATTIC - NEW ANGLE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reveals Winter River as a miniature town, while The Daddy Longlegs and the hand are normal size. Above the model are a homely representation of moon, sun, and stars -- a whole, tiny, mechanical universe to track the hours of the day. A large plat map of the city is prominent on the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hand is ADAM MAITLAND'S. In his late 30's, he's a solid easy-going citizen. Capra used to make movies about him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adam's model town sprawls across most of the attic space. Windows on either end of the attic shed good light into the warm room. Adam very carefully lifts the spider out the open window. Smiles as he drips him lightly on the breeze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA TILTS UP FROM THE WINDOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
To see the real Winter River, laid out exactly as the model, at the foot of the hill. Adam breathes deeply and looks very pleased at the glorious town below him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON HIS HUGE HAND AGAIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as it reaches into model and tweezes a tiny sign into the tiny window of Maitland's Hardware Store on main street. It reads:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ADAM AND BARBARA MAITLAND ARE ON VACATION! HOORAY!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adam leans down and eyes the sign.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm ready!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
Adam turns to see entering: BARBARA MAITLAND, 35 -- a wholesome beauty who is mellowing well. She smiles at him. Perhaps a certain tinge of sadness about her, because they don't have children.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
(happy to see her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's ready.

</ADAM>

She pushes a wrapped present across the table.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Happy vacation, honey!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>

Adam smiles and gives her a present he's hidden under the table. He opens his present. A can of furniture oil.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Manchurian Tung oil?

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where did you get it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Helen got it for me in Oslo. There's enough to refinish the gateleg table and the cherry wardrobe...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
Adam hands Barbara a carefully-wrapped bundle -- she unwraps her gift... rolls of very expensive floral wallpaper. She cradles it in her arms like gold leaf.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Adam... it's beautiful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
Adam nods, and embraces her.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Enough to do the guest room...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
(cooing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm so glad we're spending our vacation at home...

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

</BARBARA>
<ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
(pulling her back)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa!... hold on...

Barbara calms down, returning to Adam's embrace... as:

<ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing at her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
She shakes her head with resignation and goes downstairs. KNOCKING on door from below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STAIRCASE AND KITCHEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA FOLLOWS Adam and Barbara downstairs. We see the rambling, old fashioned quality to the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clean, sentimental, warm and floral. Some rooms in progress. They continue down the main staircase past photos of themselves, old photos of the early days of Winter River, pictures and mementos of three generations in hardware. Barbara goes to the kitchen and Adam continues down to the basement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HER POV - A WOMAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JANE BUTTERFIELD -- tall, gawky and aggressive peeks in the kitchen door. She's divorced three husbands and buried another for good measure. She's ruthless but is weirdly, seamlessly pleasant. She waves a legal sized paper at them, starts to come inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. KITCHEN DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barbara makes dash for it and holds it just as Jane gets a foot in. Jane smiles wildly.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Barb! I'm glad I caught you. I heard you were on vacation!

	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what we're looking for, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Barbara Maitland, sweetie, just listen now. This house is too big. It really ought to be for a couple with a family.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
That hurts Barbara a little. She looks at Jane.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, honey... I didn't mean anything... it's just too big for you.

ADAM

is humming happily, looking for paint brushes in the ground floor storeroom. He spies a cassette deck and looks through a stack of cassettes and plays one. It is an old INKSPOTS LOVE SONG.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GUEST ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barbara is starting to paper the walls already. She frowns at the MUSIC. Goes to the door.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, honey. You said no Inkspots on this vacation!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
It CLICKS OFF. She goes back into the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STOREROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adam puts away the tape but keeps humming the song. He opens the shutters on a small window. ON WINDOW...
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(her huge face grinning at him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boo!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
He jumps back, frightened.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Jane.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
Adam closes the shutters as Jane affixes yet another card to the window. He continues his search for a brush.

<DIRECTION>
JANE

INT. MAITLAND HOUSE - DAY

	<DIALOGUE>
	I need a good brush for this Tung oil and I want to pick up a piece of the model. Let's go early before anyone sees us.

Barbara has already papered a few rolls in the guest room.

</BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Victorian house from the model "in the flesh." Adam stands by the station wagon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the bumper of the car is a sticker reading: WARNING: I BRAKE FOR ANIMALS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barbara gets in driver's side. They drive off.
</DIRECTION>

We see the car coming down the hill toward the bridge.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We should be flattered that she wants to sell our house.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's not think about it. We'll have a nice romantic, quiet, vacation. Here comes the bridge chorus.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
Car reaches the rickety covered bridge. Car shakes, bobbing up and down on every plank.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON Barbara and Adam TIGHT -- (they've done this routine before). They sing an old Johnny Mathis song. With a lot of vibrato.
</DIRECTION>
<TOGETHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chances are... When I wear a foolish grin...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOGETHER>
<DIRECTION>
They laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DOWNTOWN WINTER RIVER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just like the model, but real. And populated.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PAUSES ON a gorgeous storefront with a brass lion out front. Sign above doors says --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOZMAN BUILDING 1835.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An old man polishes the lion as Maitlands drive by and wave.

Ernie looks around to see no one's looking and polishes the balls of the lion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA SPIES A JAUNTY DOG
</DIRECTION>

like Benji, peeing on the opposite corner of the lion. Maitlands drive by store with sign:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JANE BUTTERFIELD ANTIQUES REAL ESTATE TRAVEL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ANTIQUE STORE REAL ESTATE OFFICE TRAVEL AGENCY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The store is bursting with antiques of all sorts, travel brochures, photographs of houses for sale, and a serve-yourself Xerox machine. LITTLE JANE, her eight- year-old daughter is drudgingly making copies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jane, phone in hand, rushes to the window to watch Maitlands drive by. Almost popping the cord when it reaches its end. She's waiting for the other party to pick up.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Y... ello. Mrs. Deetz? Well the condition is what we country folk call, fixin'... Yes, I think they are fixin' to accept another offer. Well maybe if you offer 390,000 they'll take it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MAITLAND HARDWARE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adam sprints up the steps of his lovely hardware store. OLD BILL, a slightly-addled ancient barber, is napping in a chair in front of his shop, next door to Adam's. Adam fumbles with the lock, not interested in conver- sation. He drops his keys, waking Old Bill.
</DIRECTION>
<OLD_BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Morning, Adam. You need a haircut before your vacation?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_BILL>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No thanks, Bill.

</ADAM>
<OLD_BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's the model coming?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_BILL>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good, Bill -- Good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
Bill turns around and continues prattling even though Adam has entered. Bill prattles throughout.
</DIRECTION>
<OLD_BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Y'know, I was thinkin'... you said Bozman built the foundation in 1835 but y'know his grandson came in here last week and said he found a bottle with an 1836 stamp in it plastered in the foundation.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(suddenly disgusted at the memory)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's got hair down to his goddamned shoulders...

</OLD_BILL>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MAITLAND HARDWARE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adam pulls down a few good paintbrushes and carefully picks up a small model of the Bozman building. He walks out. Old Bill continues unabated.
</DIRECTION>
<OLD_BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He said "Just give me a trim..." I took a scissors to him so fast... would've skimmed him clean if he hadn't...
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_BILL>
<DIRECTION>
Adam strides by quickly to the car.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>

Five brushes sit on the seat next to Adam. He cradles small replica of the Bozman building, complete with brass lion.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a beauty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah it turned out okay. We applied for a historical plaque for it. That'll be the third one on Main Street.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
(jokingly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With all these historical landmarks in town, where are they going to put the condominiums?

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh... I'm sorry...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
Barbara starts to apply the brakes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just before the bridge the dog waddles out in the road. Stops to pee. Barbara swerves. As the car hits the rickety bridge, the speed is just a bit too much.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Boards RATTLE and loosen, the car skews and catches in an open slot, careens to the right, then the left and the bridge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A piling has smashed through the window on the pas- senger side, crushing the upper part of Barbara's arm. She is wailing in pain and fright.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adam tries to help Barbara. He tries to get out of the car. None of this succeeds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BRIDGE AND RIVER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dog finishes, looks over at the car, walks across the bridge and steps on the one board which holds the car aloft.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car rocks back and forth for a moment, and then slides forward toward the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CAR AND BRIDGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car plunges into the rushing water. It floats for a moment, and then sinks like a stone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO BLACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE IN:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BARBARA AND ADAM'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quiet, still, expectant. There is a fire laid in the hearth. Suddenly and for no apparent reason it ignites and burns with a furious cheerfulness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barbara and Adam enter, dazed, wet, and bedraggled.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something like this always happens when we try to go on vacation. Always.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
Adam leads her toward the fire.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll feel better when you're dry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
He holds out his hands to be warmed. Barbara comes up beside him. All this time she's been holding her injured arm with the other hand.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This fire wasn't burning when we left the house.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's your arm?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not sure. It feels... frozen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
She holds her arms out to warm them. One hand catches on fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BARBARA'S LEFT ARM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They stare at it dumbfoundedly before Adam regains his senses and snatches it out of the fire. Two of the fingers are burning like candles, and Barbara indus- triously blows them out.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Adam.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM: A FEW MINUTES LATER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are sitting on the couch together. Barbara is looking away slightly -- as one does when a doctor is drawing blood -- while Adam looks at her fingers. He frowns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at his skin. It is pale. He looks at Barbara.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'd better sit down, hon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am sitting.
	</DIALOGUE>

<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll tell you what, Barbara. I don't think we survived that crash.

</ADAM>
<BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Adam. We're home. In our own house. Nonsense. I'll make some coffee. You get some more firewood.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
Adam gets up, a little absently, she follows him as he wanders to the front door. He peers out.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's take things extra slow. Do you remember how we got back up here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
Barbara tests her hand, clenches and unclenches her fist.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm fine. My arm works fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
Adam, exploring, opens the door, steps out on the front porch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FRONT PORCH - TWILIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adam's face is painted with color of sunset. He stands atop the steps leading down to the front yard. Barbara stands just inside the open threshold, looking out worriedly.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
(quiet sarcasm)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The end of a perfect day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
Adam starts to step down to the yard.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honey, I'm gonna go down to the bridge and retrace our steps.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
He steps off the last step into the yard and promptly disappears.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Adam!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE GREAT VOID
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adam is nowhere. There's no ground, no sky, nothing to stand on or hold onto or give boundaries or distance. Just vast nothing. Not white and not colored either. NOISE OF A CLOCK TICKING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adam looks about surprised, doesn't like what he doesn't see. He turns around to head back up the steps. There are no steps.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Barbara?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
His VOICE ECHOES STRANGELY. He runs off a little in the distance, and calls again from over there.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing; quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
He goes even farther away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE FOREGROUND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
an enormous geared wheel -- the size of a man -- rolls by, tearing up the unseamed ground. Something pours up out of the tear -- ooze or stuffing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adam runs forward and stares after the wheel, which is now out of sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO SMALLER GEARS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
looking very much like components of a giant watch -- spin along behind him. One of them veers suddenly toward him, and though Adam jumps out of the way, the gear snags his trouser leg and shreds it. LOUD TICKING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A PERFECTLY ENORMOUS GEAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
comes barreling toward him. Adam leaps out of its way. The gear turns, fish-tailing, kicking up ooze and stuffing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adam flings himself suddenly to the right, but trips into the path of the gear. As he's about to be crushed, he's suddenly jerked up to safety.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's Barbara who's grabbed him, and quite evidently saved his life -- not life, perhaps -- but existence. He's shaken, breathless.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barbara stares at him, as if wondering what he's just been through.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
(weakly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You saved my -- uh -- life... or whatever...

	Yes, it did. Yes, it did. I made a couple of small discoveries.

BARBARA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stands by the mirror over the hearth mantle. On the mantle is Barbara's prize collection of porcelain horses. Adam comes to stand beside her. They look into the mirror, and there is no reflection of them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barbara picks up one of the horses, and trots it through the air. The horse is imaged in the mirror.

<BARBARA>

	<DIALOGUE>
	There's that, and there's this.

She picks up an ancient, leather-bound book. It's yellow and worn, about the size of the Boy Scout manual.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP: Its title is HANDBOOK FOR THE RECENTLY DECEASED.

<ADAM>

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adam is already in bed, reading from the handbook. Barbara is getting ready for bed -- going through a ritual of sorts that they practiced every night of their married lives.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't like situations like this. I hate it when I'm not in control. So just tell me the basics.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This book isn't arranged that way. What do you want to know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are a thousand things... Why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch? Is this a punishment? Are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell? And how long is this going to last?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't see anything about "Rewards and Punishments" or "Heaven and Hell."
	</DIALOGUE>

	I knew I'd never finish the guest room. Adam, we just can't stay in here forever!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
They look at each other, the question hangs in the air. Can't they?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adam stands and walks to the window.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
(thoughtfully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe we should set up a normal routine.

</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him like he's nuts.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, let's try to nail down something in our lives. A regular schedule. We can keep track of time and go on with our projects up here in the attic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
She shakes her head, exasperated. Flops down on the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, God, maybe this is all just a bad dream.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
ON ADAM - TIGHT - a somber look comes across his face.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm afraid not, honey.

Barbara looks up at him, questioningly.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why? What's wrong? Adam?

</BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
She stands and joins him at the window.

<DIRECTION>
THEIR POV THROUGH THE WINDOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the distance we see an automobile funeral procession threading its way toward the nearby cemetery. Head- lights are on. We recognize Jane's car in the line.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE ON BARBARA AND ADAM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
somber faces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHTER ON PROCESSION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It arrives at the gravesite. We see some familiar faces, Ernie, and Old Bill the Barber. Jane and little Jane watch as two identical coffins are carried to- gether, to two open graves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON BARBARA AND ADAM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She drops her head sadly on his shoulder. He leans his face slightly into hers.

<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT.

INT. ATTIC - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adam is setting up a small monument in the model town cemetery. It reads: ADAM AND BARBARA MAITLAND/UNITED IN LIFE/UNDIVIDED IN DEATH.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wish I had a better view of the cemetery from up here. I don't know which area is the best placement for us.

Barbara, trying to clean, lets out a frustrated YELP! She paces.

<ADAM>

(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cabin fever, han?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't clean anything. The vacuum is out in the garage. I can't leave the house. Why don't they tell us something? Where are all the other dead people in the world? Why is it just you and me?

</BARBARA>
<ADAM>

	Maybe this is heaven.

	Hon... I didn't want to die, but really, this is fine with me. Look, we never have to wash dishes again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dishes? We haven't eaten in three weeks! Adam, I'm not like you. I really need to be around people, get out to the church and go grocery shopping.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I'm not hungry, are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
Barbara shakes her head and picks up the Handbook and pages through it desperately.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I keep having this feeling that something has got to happen.

<DIRECTION>
CAR DOOR SLAMS outside. Adam and Barbara look at one another. Run to window.

EXT. MAITLAND HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jane Butterfield is staring up at the old house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ATTIC - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adam, from his angle, can just barely see her.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God, it's Jane.

</ADAM>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's she doing here?

<ADAM>

	Jane, Jane, up here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MAITLAND HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unhearing, Jane heads for car. SOUND OF WIND UP. Blows her dress. Little Jane straggles along with her like an apprentice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ATTIC - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barbara watches Adam, and shakes her head. He stops.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She can't see you, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
Adam nods.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In the book, Rule Number Two: the living usually won't see the dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Won't? Or can't?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just says "won't." Wait a minute. Here it says "the living are arrogant... they think they'll never die, so they refuse to see the dead."
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Arrogant. That's Jane all right...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
Barbara sighs and nods.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At least we won't have to worry about her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
Adam smiles and goes to his model.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MAITLAND HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jane drives away. CAMERA HINGES to see a FOR SALE sign. Across it -- another smaller banner. It reads: SOLD!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Maitlands are asleep. CAMERA EXPLORES the room a bit. It is getting slightly tatty. Adam rolls over, pulling the covers off Barbara. We see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON BARBARA -- she is hovering off the side of the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An OMINOUS RUMBLE -- like a 4.0 earthquake shakes the house. GLASS RATTLES, the ceramic horses on the mantelpiece jump around. Barbara falls to the floor. They look at one another with horror. They leap up and run downstairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The RUMBLE BUILDS TO A CLIMAX, there is a LOUD METALLIC SQUEAL, and then a CRASH... just as Barbara and Adam arrive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FRONT DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
smashes open revealing a moving van ramp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A TEN-FOOT ELECTRIC-BLUE ITALIAN LEATHER COUCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
slides smoothly down the ramp. On the couch sits DELIA DEETZ.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The couch CRASHES into the base of the staircase, smashing the newel post and several of the balusters. Barbara cringes. One of the balusters falls at Delia's side. She grasps it like a scepter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two MOVING MEN rush down the ramp.
</DIRECTION>
<MOVING_MAN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry about that, Mrs. Deetz.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOVING_MAN_1>
<DELIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry. It was going anyway.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELIA>
<DIRECTION>
Delia is relentlessly New York, relentlessly fashion- able, relentlessly thin -- totally self assured.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is also a woman with a mission -- to gut Barbara and Adam's house and remake it in her own very upscale image.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Delia's gaze is on the living room, but she looks through Adam and Barbara as if they weren't even there (which to her eyes they're not).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Still holding the baluster, Delia gets up off the couch and moves into the living room, surveying it with an odd mixture of ambition, and resolution.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEHIND HER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the two Moving Men bring in a matching blue leather armchair. In the armchair sits LYDIA DEETZ.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lydia, age 14, is a pretty girl, but wan, pale and overly-dramatic, dressed as she is in her favorite color, black. She's a combination of a little death rocker and an 80's version of Edward Gorey's little girls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She has a couple of expensive cameras around her neck -- and is already taking photographs of the moving men. Lydia is cool, Lydia is sullen, Lydia is her father's daughter by his first marriage. Lydia is usually about half-pissed off. But underneath... we like her a lot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Moving Men still hold up the chair, waiting for Delia to decide where she wants it.
</DIRECTION>
<DELIA>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus. Who lived here? The Waltons?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELIA>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON Lydia -- calmly surveys the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Delia signals wearily that the Moving Men can put the chair down anywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DELIA>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get all this other crap out of here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELIA>
<DIRECTION>
Lydia hops down out of the chair, and comes farther into the living room.
</DIRECTION>
<DELIA>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is your father?... probably in the kitchen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELIA>
<DIRECTION>
That's the cue for CHARLES DEETZ, who comes in through the swinging door, and across the dining room... a ner- vous but basically pleasant man, CHARLES DEETZ is intent on attacking rest and relaxation with the same vengeance that earned him millions in real estate.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The noise in that kitchen. Noisy refrigerator, noisy faucets... We'll have to replace it all. I want no humming in the house.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>
LYDIA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
exploring on her own, gazes around the living room with growing pleasure, she backs up for a good angle to photograph.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA HINGES -- She is standing with her back right up to Barbara -- who is horrified at this creature.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Charles enters.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>
(to Lydia)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you think, honey?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<LYDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Delia hates it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<DIRECTION>
Lydia gazes at a dusty maze of spider webs.
</DIRECTION>
<LYDIA>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could live here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<DIRECTION>
A movement makes Lydia turn around and scream. It is Delia. Not Barbara.
</DIRECTION>
<DELIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Settle down, Lydia. I wonder where we are going to get counseling for you out here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELIA>
<DIRECTION>
A VIOLENT FALSETTO SCREAM turns the Deetz family's attention to the front windows.
</DIRECTION>
<OTHO>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help! Oh help!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHO>
<DIRECTION>
OTHO'S MASSIVE BODY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wedged in the window frame. The short, stubby legs, dressed in the world's largest pair of Georgia Armani slacks, protrude into the living room, waving fran- tically. Expensive Italian loafers are kicked off the feet, revealing a pair of expensive patterned socks. By their feet shall ye know them.
</DIRECTION>
<DELIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's Otho!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELIA>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Otho, why didn't you just come in the door?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>
Otho's voice comes as if from a great distance.
</DIRECTION>
<OTHO>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's bad luck. And I believe hugely in luck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHO>
<DELIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold your breath and we'll pull.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELIA>
<DIRECTION>
Delia turns to Charles and Lydia for help -- doesn't get it -- and at last pulls Otho into the living room single-handedly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All this while the Moving Men are variously carting out the handsome old furniture and bringing in the hideous new furniture.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Otho is Robert Morley at his most obscenely fat and faggoty. But he's not all fat and fun -- this customer carries nasty emotional weight as well.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OTHO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
holds onto the curtains for support as he is pulled through the window. And when he is at last all the way through, and upright on his feet, he suddenly gives a tremendous yank. The whole drapery apparatus, including valences, crashes to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<OTHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was the single most unattractive window treatment I have ever seen in the entire of my existence.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHO>
<DELIA>
<DIRECTION>
(starry eyed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm so glad you could leave the city to consult me, Otho.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELIA>
<DIRECTION>
Otho is looking around the room with an eye of quiet horror.
</DIRECTION>
<OTHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, of course you are. Well, Otho had an intuition. Call it a hunch -- that it was going to be a fabled monstrosity of a house. And it certainly is. Charles, you're lucky the yuppies are buying condos, so you can afford what I'm going to have to do to this place. We are talking from the ground ups'ville!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHO>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's fine, Otho. Just keep me out of it. I am here to relax and clip coupons. And goddamnit, I mean to do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>
He exits to find solace in a quiet corner of his house. During this speech, Otho has been surreptitiously pos- ing for Lydia's camera. She clicks the shutter.
</DIRECTION>
<OTHO>
<DIRECTION>
(ignoring her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is the rest of the house as bad as this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHO>
<DELIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The rest of the house is probably worse. When can you and I get started?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELIA>
<OTHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No time like the present, as my wicked stepmother used to say.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHO>
<DIRECTION>
Out of the pockets of his size 56 Georgia Armani jacket, Otho takes two cans of spray paint -- the kind the graffiti artists use -- and shakes them as if they were castanets. They certainly sound like it.
</DIRECTION>
<OTHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Delia, let's get this show on the road.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHO>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At one end, near the stairs leading up to the attic, Barbara and Adam are slumped against opposite walls.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Adam, we are in hell. I hate these people.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They make Jane look good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this a punishment for something we did in life? What can we do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
(determined)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're not completely helpless. I've been reading the book. There's a word for people in our predicament, honey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
Barbara looks at him.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ghosts!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
Barbara is shocked at the reality.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Otho and Delia come up the stairs at the end of the hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<OTHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're dealing with negative entertainment potential here. I mean, there's absolutely no organic walking flow-through.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHO>
<DIRECTION>
Otho looks down the hallway. It's empty. Adam and Barbara are no longer there.
</DIRECTION>
<DELIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's wrong?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELIA>
<OTHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought I saw something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHO>
<DIRECTION>
DeLia turns and spray-paints on the wall -- in luminous orange -- the word MAUVE.
</DIRECTION>
<DELIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELIA>
<OTHO>
<DIRECTION>
(screaming with delight)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You read my mind! I love clients who can read my mind. I don't think people realize how strong a connection there is between interior design and the supernatural.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHO>
<DELIA>
<DIRECTION>
(fawning)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know... I read your book, The Haunted Tapestries of the Waldorf.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELIA>
<OTHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gooood!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHO>
<DIRECTION>
Delia opens the door and they step inside another room.
</DIRECTION>
<DELIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This will be Lydia's room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELIA>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LYDIA'S ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's not Lydia's room yet, of course, because it still has the Maitlands' furniture in it. Barbara had partly wallpapered it before the accident. Her tools are still there.
</DIRECTION>
<DELIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELIA>
<OTHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Viridian?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHO>
<DELIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Viridian? What is...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELIA>
<DIRECTION>
Otho spray-paints the word VIRIDIAN on the wall -- plus the word BLUE GREEN -- and Cr2 03, right over a picture of Adam and Barbara as kids.
</DIRECTION>
<OTHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Blue-green! Hydrated chromic oxide! Remember I'm schooled in chemistry. I was a hair analyst! Briefly. Interior design is a science, Delia! Think of me as Doctor Otho.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looking at wall)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And this patient is truly sick!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHO>
<DELIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course, her favorite color! How beautiful!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELIA>
<DIRECTION>
Delia smiles. Behind Delia and Otho, the room's closet door swings slowly open with and ominous CREAK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DELIA AND OTHO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
turn that way, with a suggestion of dread. Inside the closet, Barbara's corpse is suspended from the ceiling by a belt. The corpse twists with a CREAK, and Barbara grins ghostly -- and slowly tears off her face, leaving nothing but muscle and bone beneath. Her eyeballs dangle on her cheeks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Delia and Otho stare aghast.
</DIRECTION>
<DELIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELIA>
<OTHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We just have to pray that the other closets are bigger than this one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHO>
<DIRECTION>
He walks over. Looks inside.
</DIRECTION>
<OTHO>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Were these people dwarfes?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(sic) (spies something)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oooooo!... Look!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHO>
<DIRECTION>
He finds, neatly hung in plastic, the Maitlands' wedding outfits. Totally captivated by this powerful image, he peers through the plastic at them. Holding each up to Delia. Barbara watches wide-eyed at them.
</DIRECTION>
<OTHO>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ozzie...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(holding up her dress)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... and... Harriet! What happened to these people?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHO>
<DIRECTION>
Delia slams the door in Barbara's contorted face.
</DIRECTION>
<DELIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They died.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELIA>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOUSE - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Delia and Otho come out of Lydia's bedroom and go through the bathroom. Disgusted, they continue on to the study.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OTHO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
reaches out and turns the knob. The door swings omi- nously open on Charles' study. This had been Adam's reading and birdwatching study. Bird posters on the wall, books everywhere. Straight out of Better Homes and Gardens 1963.
</DIRECTION>
<OTHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ooo. Deliver me from L.L. Bean!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHO>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is one slight difference, however, because on the rag rug in the middle of the floor lies Adam's headless corpse. Standing over him, holding in one hand a long knife and in the other Adam's blood-and-gore dripping head is Barbara -- with a maniacal look on her face. Behind them, Charles is thumbing through Adam's Audubon collection. He sits up like a cornered animal protect- ing his territory.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>
(to Otho and Delia)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This room is off limits. I don't want either of you to touch one piece of furniture in here. This is my room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The eyes of Adam's severed head open and look up at Barbara -- she stops screaming.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Once you cover up the wallpaper, knock down a few walls, alter the traffic patterns, and -- perhaps -- think about an inground pool -- the place might just be livable. What's on the third floor?

</OTHO>
<DELIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Attic space.

INT. STUDY - SAME TIME

Adam's head has a look of terror on it.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM_S_HEAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, God. I forgot to lock the attic door!

<DIRECTION>
Adam's headless body jumps up off the floor and rushes out of the room.

<DIRECTION>
INT. STAIRCASE TO ATTIC - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Otho and Delia climbing. The headless corpse careens past them, around the bend in the stairs and out of sight.
</DIRECTION>
<OTHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you feel something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHO>
<DIRECTION>
Delia shakes her head.

<OTHO>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I felt a cool wind.

The expression on Otho's face suggests he knows more than he's telling.

The headless corpse rushes through the open door into the attic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ATTIC - SAME TIME

The headless corpse slams the door shut, turns the key in the lock. Then he slumps against the locked door in an exaggerated stance of relief.

INT. ATTIC LANDING - SAME TIME

Delia tries the knob. The door is locked.

Adam turns away from the window.

Barbara, fuming, moves around Charles making wild gestures.

She storms out of the room.

<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barbara storms in, as if straight from the room up- stairs. She heads straight for the back door. Just as she opens the door, Adam rushes up.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Barbara, honey! Don't go out there. You don't know --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing can be worse than this...

She flings open the door and steps outside. She promptly disappears.

EXT. SURFACE OF SATURN'S MOON TITAN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barbara plunges into the dusty surface of Titan with an enormous Saturn looming in the sky. She looks around with wonder and some fear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SULFUR VOLCANO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
erupts in the distance. A meteor CRASHES with a lurid EXPLOSION. As from a great distance she hears Adam's VOICE. Like THUNDER.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Barbara!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
She turns slowly in the yellow dense sand that covers the surface of this distant moon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BARBARA'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adam is trudging towards her. Behind him, hovering isolated in the air, is the kitchen door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adam at last catches up with her. Surveys around them.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh Adam. Find somebody. I'm getting all yellow. Do something!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
BEHIND THEM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Something is burrowing rapidly toward them through the sand. The Something could be right out of "Dune".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BARBARA AND ADAM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stare for a moment, then Adam grabs her and pulls her toward the kitchen door. But the kitchen door has moved, so they veer in the new direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Something follows them and rises out of the sand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON SOMETHING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a very big, very nasty, and very hungry SNAPPING SANDWORM. It ROARS and lunges at them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BARBARA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
slightly angered at it, instinctively bats at it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SANDWORM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is momentarily stunned at Barbara's audacity. It freezes and shakes its loathesome head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BARBARA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
bats at it again. Adam is wide-eyed, tries to pull her away. The Sandworm recovers and ROARS after them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ADAM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
grabs Barbara and tries to escape, but they slip and sink in the sand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They make it to the door just in time, swing it open and hurl themselves through. The door shuts with a BANG just in front of the ROARING SANDWORM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SANDWORM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
rears and ROARS in frustration, HOWLING to the ringed planet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barbara, weeping, throws herself in Adam's arms.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Adam, don't ever leave me alone.

</BARBARA>
<ADAM>

</BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
She hugs him tight.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just realized that I could have been killed alone. Don't ever leave me, honey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
Both contemplate that horror.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're trapped in this house forever... with those... people.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't say that for sure. It could be a transitional thing. Like a post-life crisis. We just have to be tougher with them. Come on. Have some brandy. Spirits?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
(a tentative smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Death didn't improve your sense of humor.

They head for the dining room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DINING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adam has his arms around Barbara's shoulder. They walk in the door and stumble upon the Deetzes at their dinner. Lydia's back is to them. Barbara and Adam back out of the room but stop to listen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Deetz's around the dining room table. There are candles and good china laid out-- but they're eating out of Chinese take-out boxes.
</DIRECTION>
<DELIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't believe that we're eating Cantonese. Is there no Szechuan up here? Hunan?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELIA>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's only one Chinese restaurant out here, darling, the owners are Irish and Irish people happen to cook Cantonese. They don't know better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<LYDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I plan to have a stroke from the amount of MSG that's in this food.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<DELIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is our first meal in this house, Lydia. Why don't we all do our little private parts to make it a pleasant one?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELIA>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lydia, relax. We'll build you a darkroom in the basement.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<LYDIA>
<DIRECTION>
(dramatically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My whole life is a darkroom! One... big... dark... room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<DIRECTION>
Delia rolls her eyes and nods. She's been through this before.
</DIRECTION>
<DELIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nonsense... you'll go to school, maybe meet a farm boy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELIA>
<DIRECTION>
Delia laughs. Charles smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<LYDIA>
<DIRECTION>
(doleful)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, maybe if he's nice, he'll let me hang myself from a rope in his barn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lydia, in a couple of years this whole town will be filled with people like us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<DELIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll be the art center of summer New York. I'll start sculpting again... I'll teach those gallery bastards to refuse my sculpture. And when Otho and I get through with this house, you people are not going to recognize it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELIA>
<LYDIA>
<DIRECTION>
(dramatically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I say let's keep it the way it is.

Delia stares at Lydia.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good idea!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>
Delia shifts her glare to Charles.
</DIRECTION>
<LYDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do. I really like it. I mean, it's already sort of like somebody's home, isn't it? Their couch is comfortable and doesn't stick to your legs. It smells like a real home, not a French whorehouse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<DELIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lydia, at your age, you are so young.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(back to business)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Charles, we need to call that awful Jane Butterfield tomorrow and get the key to the attic door. Can't you find a way to hold back some of her commission?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELIA>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're going to have a lot to do tomorrow... The Goodwill truck is coming.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<DELIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... and whatever is up there in that attic goes away with it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELIA>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Should have it fumigated, too. I saw a fly today.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>
Lydia looks at them with a mixture of sadness and anger.

<DIRECTION>
OUTSIDE THE DOOR - ON THE STAIRS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- listening, sit Barbara and Adam. A tear rolls down her face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ATTIC - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adam and Barbara are lying down on the floor, peering out of one of the small windows overlooking the front yard of the house. The handbook open in front of them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FRONT YARD - ADAM AND BARBARA'S POV - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The entire front yard is alive with workmen and their vehicles. Plumbers, electricians, cable TV men, etc. In the road on front of the house are several cars of rubbernecking locals, astonished by all the activity. The City has come to Town. Moving men continue to move in the Deetz' modern, expensive and ugly furniture. They collide with Goodwill men coming out with the Maitlands' lovely antiques and personal possessions.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ATTIC - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adam and Barbara just look at one another as if to say "We're next!" Adam leafs through the handbook furi- ously.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look in the index...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not really... what's this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
Adam pulls from the book an ancient, yellowed, crumbling handbill. He carefully opens it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON handbill -- very primitive, crude, red printing.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (reading)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Having difficulty adjusting? Is death a problem and not a solution? Unhappy with eternity? Troubled by the living? Call Betelgeuse, the bio-exorcist. That's Betelgeuse, Betel...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
The remainder of the sheet is torn off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON Barbara -- fingering the torn edge. Looking in the book for the remainder. No luck.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's it? No number, or instructions?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing. The bio-exorcist? I don't get it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Charles, away from the chaos outside is calmly steeping a mug of herb tea. His solitude is interrupted by a 2500 lb. Vulcan range breaking through a too-small kitchen window.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>
(shouting through the window)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell are you trying to do out there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>
DELIA - OUTSIDE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is berating the inept crane operator and shrieks periodically at some fine art movers who are struggling under her horrid modern welded steel sculptures.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LYDIA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
snaps photos of the mayhem. She stops to scan the whole house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LYDIA'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When her gaze reaches to top of the house, she suddenly glimpses Barbara and Adam's faces in the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lydia blinks hard. Her mouth drops open. She looks all around -- as if she'd just seen a ghost or two.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JANE BUTTERFIELD'S CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
pulls up. Little Jane sits in the front seat, burdened with an enormous stack of collated and stapled copies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lydia catches sight of Jane and runs over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Little Jane locks her door, in fear of Lydia-the strange. Lydia stares at her.
</DIRECTION>

</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
Jane hands a key to Lydia.

<LYDIA>
<DIRECTION>
(impressed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this the key to the attic?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a skeleton key. It'll open any door in that house. Will you give it to your father?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(handing her a business card)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you might mention that I single-handedly decorated the house. In case he needs advice in that area. Come see me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
Jane goes away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lydia's face sobers as she looks up at the now empty attic window.
</DIRECTION>
<DELIA>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help! Get off me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELIA>
<DIRECTION>
Lydia drops the skeleton key into her pocket surrepti- tiously. She follows Delia's SHRIEKING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lydia rounds the corner to see Delia, pinned flat against the house by one of her horrid steel sculp- tures. Two movers are struggling to free her. Lydia snaps a quick photograph.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They finally free Delia. She clutches at her head, just short of tearing her hair out.
</DIRECTION>
<DELIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You jerks! That is my art, and it is dangerous! You think I want to want to die like that?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Lydia. Moving is a family affair. So buckle down now and go get Mommy some drugs.

</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That little girl saw us.

<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She couldn't have. We can't make them see us.

INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lydia looks up the stairs at the attic landing. She's a little scared. She decides to go up the dark stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE HALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the end of the hall stands Charles, directing men who are carrying books into the room that will be his study.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He continues on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BLAST of STEAM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
fills the hallway, because workmen are already going at the wallpaper. Lydia emerges from it. Looking up at stairway to attic, mounting courage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STAIRCASE TO ATTIC - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lydia creeps upward, taking the skeleton key from her pocket. FLOORBOARDS SQUEAK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ATTIC - DAY

Adam works on his model. He hears the SQUEAK, looks up confidently.

	Don't worry. I've locked it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
Barbara smiles and knits while rocking in her chair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ATTIC LANDING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lydia quietly inserts the key in the lock of the attic door. She turns it. The key is stiff. She turns harder. It's stuck. Lydia tries the door -- it's no go. She turns the key again. This time it goes all the way around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ATTIC - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barbara and Adam, surprised by the key, look at each other, carefully, very quietly, stand up and tiptoe toward door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE SCREEN OF AN OLD TV SET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
in the corner of the attic -- Suddenly -- a ghostly image POPS ON.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON TV - A BIZARRE, SMALLISH FELLOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
outfitted in a too-big cowboy hat, bad wig, and over- sized sunglasses appears on screen singing very quickly. (It's a heavily disguised BETELGEUSE.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEHIND HIM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the CAMERA QUICKLY PANS an assortment of tombstones a la Cal Worthington.
</DIRECTION>
<BETELGEUSE>
<DIRECTION>
(singing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have the living got you down? Betelgeuse! Are they jacking you around? Betelgeuse! Have you broken out in hives 'Cause you're tired of their jive? I will drive them from your hive... Betelgeuse!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETELGEUSE>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA TILTS DOWN a flashing tombstone with "BETELGEUSE" written on it. Adam rushes over to shut it off. He can't find a plug. He looks around behind set... no workings inside at all. He peers around to the screen. It is blank. Suddenly -- Betelgeuse POPS ON AGAIN.
</DIRECTION>
<BETELGEUSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say it once... Betelgeuse Say it twice... Betelgeuse. The third time's a charm... Betelgeuse! Come on down!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETELGEUSE>
<DIRECTION>
He POPS OFF. Adam and Barbara stare at each other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LANDING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lydia listens. Did she hear something? She puts her hand on the knob and tries to turn it. It's stuck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then the key eerily pops out of the lock and falls on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Charles' head suddenly appears behind her. Scares her.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing?

</CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ATTIC

She hands her father the key. He looks at it and throws it in the corner.

TIGHT ON LYDIA

She is resolved.

Charles continues. She begins to follow slowly.

INT. ATTIC
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barbara and Adam have moved away from the door.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
(looking through the handbook)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We need some help. I found something this morning. Here. Emergencies.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(reads)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"In case of emergency, draw door."

</ADAM>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Draw door? I don't know why we keep looking in that stupid book.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
Adam takes a piece of chalk and draws a little door on the exposed brick of the chimney.

<BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't actually think this is going to work?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
Adam draws a doorknob. Then he tries to turn it. The door, perhaps to his surprise, fails to open.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yet another triumph for Adam and Barbara in the afterlife. Why don't we try this Beetle guy??...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at book, then writes on the door: KNOCK AND ENTER. He exchanges a glance with Barbara. She's even more skeptical than before. Turns away in disgust.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adam knocks on the door, and turns the knob. Nothing. She is more disgusted. Adam goes back to the book.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aha! Knock three times.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He knocks three times. Turns knob. The chalked door swings magnificently open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind is an eerie light source, SOARING MUSIC, maybe even a heavenly choir singing pear-shaped syllables.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barbara and Adam look at one another again. They hold hands and step tentatively through.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Their figures are lost in the blinding light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They start to shut door after them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE ATTIC LANDING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lydia is staring at the light pouring from under the attic door. It suddenly goes out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON LYDIA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is dumbfounded. She listens.

ON THE LANDING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lydia speeds down the steps.

INT. CHARLES' STUDY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Charles, fiercely intent on relaxing, paces like a catfish out of water. Ralph Lauren in K-mart. He stretches. He sits uneasily in an easy chair, tries like hell to get comfortable. Finally, he puts a book under his bottom to get sitting straight. Looks around tapping his fingers. What to do? Looks at watch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes down a book from Adam's library, it is an Audubon book of birds. He whips through it like it's the comics and then looks around for more.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He finds the "Illustrated Walden" by Thoreau. He speed reads it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is now really bored. Goes to the fireplace, tries to light it. Cannot do it. Goes to desk and writes:
</DIRECTION>
<OTHO_INSTALL_GAS_FIRE_LOGS_IN STUDY>

He studies bird posters. Finds beautiful cardinal picture.

Takes field glasses and looks out window.

	Well I just wanted to tell you what I saw.

<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lydia. What the hell is the point of my moving up here if you people won't let me relax? Go help your mother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>
Charles returns to field glasses, spies something. She looks at him in frustration.
</DIRECTION>
<LYDIA>
<DIRECTION>
(on her way out)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine. Maybe you can relax in a haunted house. But I can't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<DIRECTION>
She exits. Charles peers after her, brow furrowed. Looks out again at the village. Uses his field glasses to get a better look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is the Bozman Building. Ernie is out front pol- ishing the brass lion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON CHARLES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He thinks. Moves the field glasses to punctuate his discovery of the building. (His eyes never leave field glasses throughout the following.)
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice building... Bad paint. Good lines... bad roof. Good parking... hmmm???
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>
That really registers with him. Without looking, he dials a familiar number on the phone with one hand, lifts the receiver. He clacks his teeth together pur- posefully.
</DIRECTION>
<SECRETARY_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Botco International.

TIGHT SHOT - BARBARA AND ADAM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Very still, they look cautiously to the right and left -- just with their eyes. They're astounded by what they see, though we don't yet see it.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Not what I expected when we walked through that door.

<DIRECTION>
CAMERA DRAWS BACK and we find that Adam and Barbara are in:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The most unpleasant waiting room that you ever remember waiting in. Fifties furniture with broken legs, couches propped up on telephone books.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standing ashtrays with dirty stand. Linoleum floors patched a hundred times. National Geographics with the covers torn off. The "Take a number" registers in the millions.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AS THE CAMERA COMPLETES A CIRCLE OF THE ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see a RECEPTIONIST. She's the quintessential 50's receptionist -- tight sweater, bullet-breasted bra, bleached hair, red lipstick. She's wearing a ribbon across her breast reading "MISS ARGENTINA" and there are knife slashes across both wrists.
</DIRECTION>

	Nine months? What difference does that make?

	Good luck. You're going to use up all your help vouchers.

</RECEPTIONIST>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help vouchers?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<RECEPTIONIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	D-90's. You spend a hundred and twenty-five years on earth, actually, in that house, during which you get only three class-one D-90 intercessions with Juno. You probably haven't even read through the manual completely yet.

	For Juno, your caseworker. Not that it matters to your type. But there are all these other people here ahead of you. I'd say 3 hours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RECEPTIONIST>
<DIRECTION>
The waiting room is now filled with people. Dead people, some in fairly awful states. A cornucopia of carnal shreddage.

Adam and Barbara look around for a moment, then very quietly, they reach out to grasp hands.

INT. ATTIC LANDING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lydia kneels down with a screwdriver, a nail file, an ice pick, and a credit card. She inserts nail file into the door. She struggles, and after several attempts -- finally uses the ice pick and POP! The door swings open ominously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ATTIC - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lydia enters. The room is dim, and filled with dust motes. There are shadows in all the corners.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She bumps into a switch which engages the model sun and moon and that eerily illuminates the model town. She's frightened, then entranced.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She peers at it from different angles, her fear for- gotten. She notes small tools scattered around an unfinished area. She continues around the model, oblivious to everything else. Then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She kicks something. Ducks under the table and comes up with something, holds it up to the light. It's the handbook. She looks through it. Finds the marked page... looks at the chalk door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barbara and Adam are still holding hands, as if they hadn't moved. Like waiting for an IRS audit.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
(to Adam)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this what happens when you die?

The Receptionist overhears. She points at Barbara.

	This is what happens when YOU die.

(points to another corpse)
</DIRECTION>

	That is what happens when HE dies. That is what happens when THEY die. It's highly personal. And I'll tell you something... if I knew then what I know now... I wouldn't have had my little "accident!"

She holds up her wrists and smiling at her little joke, wriggles them indicating her slashes.

Barbara and Adam look at them. Corpses resume doing what they were doing. A GRINDING NOISE O.S. -- The Receptionist looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barbara and Adam also look O.S.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THEIR POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Message delivery wire GRINDS along loudly on a pulley. The actual message is held in the hand of the MESSENGER, a flattened corpse, suspended as if on a shirt clothesline, tire marks on his face and clothing. A major roadkill. Dust and gravel ground into him. He smiles wanly at Barbara and Adam as the Receptionist takes a message on a piece of paper and reads it.
</DIRECTION>
<RECEPTIONIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maitland, party of two! Take your handbook and go to the sixth door.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RECEPTIONIST>

Barbara and Adam upset at the loss of their handbook...

	Airhead.

</RECEPTIONIST>
<DIRECTION>
Adam and Barbara walk through a door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TYPING POOL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A vast room of desks arranged in a grid, straight out of "How To Succeed In Business"... Each desk is occupied, too, but most of the secretaries are merely skeletons, or mouldering corpses slumped over their typewriters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Only one secretary, somewhere in the vast grid, is typing slowly, with long pauses between words.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Messenger on his return trip, parallels Barbara and Adam as they walk along. Barbara can't look at him.
</DIRECTION>
<MESSENGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do I look? There're no mirrors on this side.

</DIRECTION>

	Fine, you look fine.

<MESSENGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks. I've been feeling a little flat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MESSENGER>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He laughs at his own joke as he goes back through the very, very narrow slot in the wall where the line runs. Adam and Barbara look to the right and left. A vast stack of files slips off a desk and spills out onto the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barbara and Adam enter corridor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Empty, like a hotel corridor, but all the doors are of different types -- a revolving door, a dutch door, church doors. They walk past a waist-high window, covered by a roll-up shade.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A hundred twenty-five years! I can't believe it. I can't believe they didn't tell us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
She bumps into the shade and it rolls up FLAPPING. She stares in through the window. Adam peers in it too.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THEIR POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A smouldering, mist-filled room. From the smoky plasma floats an occasional tortured soul. Unspeakably SAD MUSIC wafts from within. They get only a glimpse of the bodies in this horrible human soup.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Adam, look at this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, floating up from below, immediately on the other side of the window, a white-crepe face emerges. It seems to be that of a woman, her eyes are red and blue tears rim them. Her pale skin is covered with a flaking crust of salt. She wears the saddest look ever. Her mouth opens plaintively but no sound comes.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Adam... what is this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
A reflection joins them on their side of the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SINISTER LITTLE JANITOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
wizened and efficient, pulls the shade down firmly.
</DIRECTION>
<SINISTER_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the lost souls room. A room for ghosts who have been exorcised. Poor devils. That's death for the dead. It's all in the handbook. Keep moving.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SINISTER_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
The man scuttles off. Adam and Barbara walk on sadly, until they come to a door that looks exactly like the swinging door between the kitchen and dining room of their house.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is it... the sixth door.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
Puzzled -- Barbara pushes it.

INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Everything is dark, quiet -- but the furniture is obviously not theirs, and neither is the decoration. Adam and Barbara exchange glances, and push on through into the living room.

ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A spot comes on, revealing JUNO -- their caseworker. She's an older woman, no nonsense about her. Over- dressed in an outfit that includes a blouse with ruffled cuffs. We will at some point catch a glimpse of her slashed throat -- she smokes heavily. Occa- sionaly smoke puffs from her cut throat.
</DIRECTION>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd nearly given up on you. I was about to leave. I do have other clients.

The following conversation takes place as Barbara and Adam follow Juno as she looks around the house and ends up in their attic space.

</JUNO>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have to start simpler, is that it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Start simply. Do what you know. Use your talents. Practice. We only help those who help themselves. Just do a little at a time. And of course, practice, practice, practice. It's tricky but -- you weren't murderers by any chance, were you?

<JUNO>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I strongly suggest that you remove the Deetz's yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNO>
<DIRECTION>
She takes a final drag on the cigarette and smoke billows out the hole in her throat. Juno starts to FADE.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And if we need you again, how do we...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
Juno fades. Gone. Barbara goes to the model, looks at the cemetery.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That guy is in our cemetery. Oh, Adam.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
(holds her shoul- ders, calms her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, she's right. We'll just start simple, honey, be tougher. I feel... confident. C'mon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
They exit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA FOLLOWS ACTION - OVER THE MODEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The FLY BUZZES. It lands and crawls along into the model of the cemetery.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FLY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
resplendently green and iridescent, pauses and fiddles with its hairy parts. Starts to walk by.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pssstt! Over here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Fly stops. Tilts its multi-eyed head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two hands come up from the earth of that grave holding a candy bar.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't use this. You should have it. Flies get so little respect anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
THE FLATTERED FLY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
walks over to the grave. In a flash, the hands grab the struggling fly and dance it like a doll over the grave and then pull it into the earth.
</DIRECTION>
<FLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Buzzz!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turns into)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help me! Help me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLY>
<DIRECTION>
A MANIACAL LAUGH grows from the grave. WIND BLOWS as the Fly disappears. Ivy whips away from the grave- stone. We see, for the first time, the chiseled name:
</DIRECTION>
<BETELGEUSE>
<DIRECTION>
CLAP OF THUNDER.

INT. CHARLES' STUDY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Charles is on the phone. He has drawings laid out in front of him. He is at his most urban persuasive, and oddly relaxed -- he is finally in his own element.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maxie, have I not always made you money? I think that is the only real question here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MAXIE'S OFFICE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
New York office, cool design, black couch, and MAXIE DEAN, a 55-year-old, super tan, white-haired wheeler dealer. Sign says: CHAIRMAN of BOTCO INDUSTRIES. Maxie looks rich and he looks cool as he talks to Charles. Behind him, Sarah, his rich-looking blonde wife, is looking at herself in a mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<MAXIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Charles -- no one has made me money like you. Until your nerves went, you were a demon. It is just that... Winter River, Connecticut is, you'll forgive me, no fucking where. Why would I invest that kind of money to buy an old building way the hell up there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAXIE>
<DIRECTION>
INTERCUT CONVERSATION
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not a building! That's the beauty of it. I think I can buy the whole town. These people don't know the value of their property!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<MAXIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then we own a whole town full of nowhere.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAXIE>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, No -- C'mon, Max, you know me. I've got plans. You gotta come up here and see, then I'll tell you about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>
Maxie isn't much interested.
</DIRECTION>
<MAXIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, sure, Charles, but I am busy here... you know how it was when you were active.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAXIE>
<DIRECTION>
This burns Charles. But he swallows it. He hears something in the corridor outside -- a kind of LOW MOANING.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>
(into telephone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a minute, Maxie. Somebody.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<MAXIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No listen... we'll talk about this visiting later, I gotta go, I gotta meeting on the Japanese joint venture.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAXIE>
<CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>
(torn between the MOANING and Maxie)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great idea, Maxie! Those Japanese could run it for us. Listen, think right about it, will you? We've almost got the house ready, you bring Sarah with you and I'll show you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<MAXIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah yeah, we'll think on it. Bye ya, Charles. You relax up there, ya hear?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAXIE>
<DIRECTION>
Maxie hangs up. Shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<MAXIE>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Putz! Inter River? My ass.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAXIE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHARLES' STUDY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Charles hangs up frustrated. MOANING INCREASES. He goes to the door and flings it open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A figure is right there in the doorway -- A ghost under a sheet. But a "designer" sheet. He wails away like a banshee. Eyeholes cut in sheets, Charles jumps, re- covers.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Jesus, Lydia! Is Connecticut so boring that you have to think up shit like this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>
ON Barbara, she stands back away from the door observ- ing skeptically.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had Maxie Dean on the phone! Darling, Dad's found a way to make some money here while I relax, so scram!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>
He slams the door, turns around. Then turns around again, and jerks the door open. The ghost is retreat- ing, beaten.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And your mother is going to kill you when she sees that you cut holes in her $300 sheets. You provoke her you know. I mean she can be an unreasonable bitch. But you do provoke her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>
He SLAMS the door again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adam helps Barbara on with her sheet.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God, this is so corny. Have we been reduced to this? Sheets?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Think of them as death shrouds. And the moaning is important. Really moan!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(imitating Juno)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Practice, practice, practice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Television still going, Delia asleep with curlers. Adam and Barbara glide inside, go over and stand beside the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Deep breath... and...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LYDIA'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She has her ever-present camera around her neck. Sud- denly hears MOANS from her parents' room. Thinking it is sexual, she cringes. Covers her ears.
</DIRECTION>
<LYDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gross! How can he stand that woman?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(louder)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, cut it out! I'm a child! For God sakes!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<DIRECTION>
The NOISE gets weirder. Lydia gets interested.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adam and Barbara moan and groan. Delia doesn't stir.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I feel really stupid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not stupid. We're ghosts. Do you want this woman for breakfast for 125 years? Moan louder!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
Barbara moans louder and more weirdly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Delia stirs, sits up, but doesn't open her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adam and Barbara are excited then... disappointed as Delia fumbles on the bedside table for the remote con- trol device, and without opening her eyes, turns off the television set. Then she turns over, and is lost to the world totally.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barbara sighs. She and Adam walk toward the door. When they open it however, Lydia is standing there in her pajamas -- she snaps a FLASH Polaroid -- and Adam and Barbara jump backwards with yelps of fright.
</DIRECTION>
<LYDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sick! Sexual perversion! If you're going to do weird sexual stuff you ought to stay in your bedroom, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<DIRECTION>
Lydia starts back into her room. Then looks at the developing photograph. Something catches her eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lydia yelps with fear.
</DIRECTION>
<LYDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holy cow! No feet!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<DIRECTION>
She screams. Adam and Barbara scream. Lydia rushes back toward them, starts flashing pictures.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adam and Barbara run around and are pushed into a corner. Polaroids fly everywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lydia runs out of film. She stares at them, panting with fear. A standoff.
</DIRECTION>
<LYDIA>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A... Are you the guys who're hiding out in the attic?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
(fake terror voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're ghosts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
Barbara moans.
</DIRECTION>
<LYDIA>
<DIRECTION>
(skeptical, cautious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	W... What do you look like under there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<DIRECTION>
Adam and Barbara pull shut bedroom door, go out into the hall -- as if to keep from waking Delia with their conversation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All three stare at each other tentatively.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aren't you scared?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<LYDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not scared of Ralph Lauren. Those are sheets. Are you gross under there? Are you "Night of the Living Dead" under there? Like all bloody veins and pus?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<LYDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Night of the Living Dead?" It's a movie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
(pulling off the sheet)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I had seen a ghost at your age, I would have been frightened out of my wits.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<LYDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not gross. Why were you wearing a sheet?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're practicing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can actually see us? Without the sheets?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<LYDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this like a trick question?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell the truth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<LYDIA>
<DIRECTION>
(offended)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course I can see you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nobody else can.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<LYDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm wearing contacts... Also I read through the "Handbook for the Recently Deceased." It says that live people ignore the strange and unusual... I, myself, am strange and unusual.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
(tenderly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You look like a regular girl to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
Lydia blushes. Barbara smiles warmly. She is begin- ning to like Lydia.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You read our book? Could you follow it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
Lydia nods her head.
</DIRECTION>
<LYDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are you creeping around Delia's bedroom?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We were trying to scare your mother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<LYDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stepmother. I'm very sensitive about being related to reptiles.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<DIRECTION>
Barbara smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<LYDIA>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't scare her. She's sleeping with Prince Valium tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(defiantly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I stole the key to your attic, you know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<DIRECTION>
Adam and Barbara look at each other.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe we better talk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ATTIC ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adam's rigged up the moon, and stars, too. Adam and Barbara and Lydia stand just beyond the fringes of the town, dimly lighted giants.
</DIRECTION>
<LYDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You did this? You carved all these little figures and houses and things?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
(pleased)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I certainly did. I'd finish it too, but... I don't get out much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<LYDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And this used to be your house, I bet. Why do you want to scare everybody?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We want to frighten you away.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a little embarrassed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So that you'll move out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<LYDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't know the Deetz's very well, do you? My father bought this place. He never walks away from equity. Why don't you leave?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can't. We haven't left the house since the funeral.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<LYDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Funeral. God, you guys really are dead!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(fascinated)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was it like? The funeral. Did you cry?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We weren't there. The handbook says funerals aren't for the dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<LYDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God, if this is true this is amazing! I kinda like it up here. Can I visit you sometimes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I don't know... We don't get many visitors.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>

Lydia flushes.

</CHARLES>
<LYDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I better go...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait... I don't think it would be a very good idea if you told your parents that we're up here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Unless you think it would scare them off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
Lydia starts to exit.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You tell them that we are desperate horrible ghoulish creatures who will stop at nothing to get back our house.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<LYDIA>
<DIRECTION>
(looks him up and down)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a minute, what if this is a dream? Can you do any tricks to prove I'm not dreaming?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<DIRECTION>
Barbara shakes her head, a little ashamed.
</DIRECTION>
<LYDIA>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, if you are real ghosts, you better get another routine, those sheets suck!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<DIRECTION>
She sneaks a smile at Barbara and exits.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A big ugly machine is doing something unnecessary to the yard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DARKROOM/BASEMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The FAST-TICKING CLOCK is a timer. Lydia is making Polaroid enlargements. She's quick and expert at this. She's examining a print with a magnifying glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Delia shrieks. Going through the dirty clothes, she's just come across the sheets with the eye holes in them.
</DIRECTION>
<DELIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lydia! Lydia! My hands are shredded from doing the laundry, and now I have to deal with your vandalism!

</DELIA>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lydia, pounding up from the basement with the wet print, collides with Delia, rushing down from the sec- ond floor with the scissored sheets.
</DIRECTION>
<DELIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lydia, honest to God I'm going to kill you. I'm having a party tonight. I'm cooking, I can't get servants. Do I need angst? No, I certainly do not!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELIA>
<DIRECTION>
Lydia speeds by her.
</DIRECTION>
<DELIA>

INT. CHARLES' OFFICE - DAY

Lydia rushes in. Charles is working furiously on a word processor, amidst an array of maps and plans.
</DIRECTION>
<LYDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad. Do you believe me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Except when you creep around in your mother's --

</CHARLES>
<LYDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stepmother's...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>

	Well this is... I mean, this is the weirdest --

<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lydia, I don't know what it is with you and these pratical jokes, but --
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<LYDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is not a joke! That sheet was full of ghosts.

</LYDIA>
<DIRECTION>
She hands him the photo. He looks. Lydia points out...
</DIRECTION>
<LYDIA>

	No feet.

</LYDIA>
<DIRECTION>
Charles laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<LYDIA>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't believe me. That sheet was full of ghosts. They live here.

Charles begins to scroll through computer program.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>
(dismissing it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very clever, Lydia. Now would you please -- I'll tell you what... I know! You're bored, right? You take that camera and your bike and photograph every building in town. Don't tell anyone what it's for...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(handing her a wad of bills)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here, take some cash and go do it. How's that? You want to stretch, don't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>
Lydia exits, with determination. Charles looks up on the wall and runs his finger over a plat map of Winter River, just like Adam's in the attic.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at the size of these lots...

Adam peers at the map, puzzled.

Barbara follows Lydia out. Adam thinks, intrigued. Exits.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Delia is frantically preparing for the evening's dinner party. Lydia is very much in her way, trying to show her the photographs. Delia isn't looking at them.
</DIRECTION>
<DELIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't believe you are doing this to me! Ghosts. I am giving a dinner party for seven people tonight. Otho has agreed to come back for the demolition of the attic. My agent, Bernard, is bringing some woman who writes for "Art in America." In fact, no one here tonight has not been in "Vanity Fair." Except you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELIA>
<LYDIA>
<DIRECTION>
(resigned)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told them you were too mean to be afraid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<DELIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you dare talk to others about me. I'm an artist! The only thing that scares me is being embarrassed in front of my friends. Do you know how hard it is to get civilized people to set foot in this part of Connecticut? Not a solitary word of this pubescent tripe to anyone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELIA>
<DIRECTION>
Lydia exits angrily.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA HINGES. Barbara is watching, horrified at Delia's occupation of her (Barbara's) kitchen. Adam appears.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lydia's trying, but they don't believe her.
	</DIALOGUE>

<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Adam, you had a photo of Big Foot!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is different. Eventually she'll take someone to the attic. And then what? We've got to try to contact this guy Betelmyer. We gotta get some help, hon.

<DIRECTION>
INT. ATTIC ROOM - LATER - DAY

Adam looks intently through the book.

Barbara's eye is caught by something in the model cemetery. She moves over and sees a small gravestone lit up by neon.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Adam!

Adam comes over. Looks.

EXT. INSIDE THE MODEL GRAVEYARD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIND BLOWS -- With shovels and lanterns, Adam and Barbara are unlikely gravediggers. The mechanized clouds move in the sky across the mechanical moon, throwing weird shadows everywhere. Ground fog creeps slowly along the graves. It is so eerie.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
Adam looks down at the grave. Knocks on the stone. Nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Has anything been simple so far? From the look of the shovel, we dig.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Adam. I don't have gloves. My nails keep getting longer. I'll break them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
Hands her a shovel anyway. She digs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. INSIDE THE MODEL GRAVEYARD - LATER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They're almost down six feet. By now they are both almost out of sight in the grave. Inside the grave -- Adam suddenly hits wood.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's about time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
They lean down and brush dirt off a brass plate on the coffin.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"BETELGEUSE"
	</DIALOGUE>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess we open it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe we should knock first?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
A slight TREMOR shakes them. They look at each other and try to scramble from the grave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOPSIDE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They just barely crawl out when a mouldering corpse springs out of the grave and jumps on Barbara's back, and plants a thousand-year-old kiss on her lips. She screams and burbles. Adam pulls the corpse off her back. The corpse does a Three Stooges hammer on Adam's head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adam staggers backward, unhurt but shocked. All three stop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE CORPSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Something unreal about him, almost mechanical. Then the corpse, grinning insanely at them, flies straight up into the air over their heads. He CRASHES against the tombstone...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And Adam and Barbara see the corpse is only a huge marionette on a string and pole. A LAUGH comes from behind the gravestone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PUPPETEER BETELGEUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
steps out. He looks like someone who just crawled out from under a rock. This is one slippery customer. Betelgeuse speaks in a rapid polyglot, choosing words and phrases from every slang in the world. Barbara is mighty uneasy.
</DIRECTION>
<BETELGEUSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right. Who are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETELGEUSE>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>

<ADAM>

	Aren't you dead?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<BETELGEUSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hell no! I'm rolling. I'm a businessman. I'm the man what am. Beeetel Jooose! Who do I gotta kill?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETELGEUSE>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't kill anyone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just get some people out of our house.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<BETELGEUSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bio busting. I love it. Who do I gotta kill? Family -- right? Obnoxious, I bet.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(contorting face)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mommie, daddy, piglets.
	</DIALOGUE>

<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just one daughter.

(back to work)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So a daughter? She got good legs? God I love a young leg.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETELGEUSE>
<DIRECTION>
Air blows up Barbara's dress, exposing her legs. He leers.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's only fourteen...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... acts like she's thirty-five.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<BETELGEUSE>
<DIRECTION>
(rubbing hands)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How does she feel about short old men with dirty ears?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETELGEUSE>
<DIRECTION>
Barbara is grossed out and increasingly uneasy. Beetle Juice senses it and gets back to business.
</DIRECTION>
<BETELGEUSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you, the dead, want me, the undead, to throw the live guys -- Mommie, Daddy and Lolita, who might not mind a tumble with an older guy, out into the cold? Even though they have paid hard casharoonie for your dump?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETELGEUSE>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But... the Deetzes are destroying our house.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<BETELGEUSE>
<DIRECTION>
(scolding sarcasm)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You Maitlands are the backbone of the afterlife. So what's my cut?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETELGEUSE>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you scare them off?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
Beetle Juice looks offended.
</DIRECTION>
<BETELGEUSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me, scary? You be the judge.

He swirls his face and shoulders into a horrifying image. Pleased, he laughs at himself.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Honey. Let's go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go? What d'ya mean? We need help.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, we don't. We can work something out ourselves. We just have to try harder.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<BETELGEUSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold on. Let's not be squeamish, missy. You rang my bell, you gotta lick the pump. I'm rolling!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETELGEUSE>
<DIRECTION>
BARBARA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
grabs Adam. Betelgeuse is getting mad. Not pretty.
</DIRECTION>
<BETELGEUSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Folks, be reasonable here. I'm at your service. You be the judge. I'm a harmless guy. Try me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETELGEUSE>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Home. Home. Home!

</BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
ZAP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are gone. Betelgeuse is furious.
</DIRECTION>
<BETELGEUSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You fresh corpse creeps! Who do you think you are?... Walking away from a professional?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETELGEUSE>
<DIRECTION>
BETELGEUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
walks to a tree and kicks it hard. The whole huge tree falls, KABLOOM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ATTIC - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small tree falls in the model. Adam, across the room, walks over and straightens it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at Barbara who is poring over the handbook. Making notes. Counting out procedures.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honey, I think that was a mistake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am not going to expose that little girl to that... pervert down there.

<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How'd you do that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
(proud of herself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a hunch... remember things come in threes -- three times in, three times out... I'm getting the hang of this stuff.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think we really pissed him off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't care...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But we let him out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've changed my mind... I feel really confident. We're getting better at this stuff. We can scare them off ourselves -- tonight! I've got an idea. You're going to love it... I'm going to hate it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
ADAM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
turns to look down at the model again. Straightens the tree. Turns away. We can see a tiny light moving through the tiny model forest towards the house.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. But that Betelgeuse sure seemed mad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<BETELGEUSE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (singing)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi ho, hi ho, it's off to work I go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETELGEUSE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dinner for seven, as promised. Everything looks very nice. Deetzes are in control and in their element. The element is neurotic-chic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Some of the guests are affecting distaste for having had to make the long drive to Connecticut. There's a bitchy feud going on between GRACE, the "Art In Amer- ica" writer, and BERNARD, Delia's agent, that threatens to become a full-scale war.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Otho is drunkish and engaged in his third favorite occupation -- direct attacks on the personal weaknesses of his friends. He's singled out his victim, BERYL, the editor for Ballantine, a frail-looking woman who is dressed "artistically."
</DIRECTION>
<OTHO>
<DIRECTION>
(to Beryl)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, darling, you can only have a hysterectomy once, so why don't you tell us what you really went into the hospital for last week? Or dare I ask, is that a nose "nouveau?"
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHO>
<CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>
(privately; to Otho)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Otho, you've got to help me get Maxie Dean up here. I have a deal that could make all of us very comfortable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<OTHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's a cloven-hooved beast!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHO>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's your cousin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<OTHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am ashamed to say he is. Look, nothing short of giving away free sacks of money would get him up here, Charles. And Sarah? Forget it. You can't get her out of Bergdorf's with plastic explosives.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(still on Beryl's case)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just hope it wasn't yet another of your dreary suicide attempts. You know what they say about people who who commit suicide. In the afterlife, they become civil servants.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHO>
<BERNARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Otho! I didn't know you were into the supernatural?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNARD>
<OTHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course you remember! After my stint with the living theatre. I was one of New York City's leading paranormal researchers until the bottom dropped out of the business in '72.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHO>
<BERYL>
<DIRECTION>
(sick to death of this blowhard)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Paranormal... Is that what they're calling your kind now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERYL>
<DIRECTION>
Lydia watches Otho thoughtfully. Suddenly very cur- ious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Delia senses that Lydia might talk ghosts here.
</DIRECTION>
<DELIA>
<DIRECTION>
(a threat; quietly to Lydia)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you dare.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELIA>
<LYDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I saw some ghosts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<DIRECTION>
All quiet.
</DIRECTION>
<DELIA>
<DIRECTION>
(interrupting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lydia tried to play a most amusing joke on me this afternoon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELIA>
<LYDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It wasn't a joke.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<DELIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tried to convince me that this house is haunted. Kids. Kids. Kids! I love them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELIA>
<DIRECTION>
Otho's glance sharpens at this. Everyone else listens.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By ghosts?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<LYDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By what else?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<DELIA>
<DIRECTION>
(laughing it away)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In sheets yet. Designer sheets. They --
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELIA>
<DIRECTION>
Charles, seeing things aren't going well for Delia, proposes a toast.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I propose a toast to our intrepid friends. Who braved the expressway and fourteen toll booths to visit us. May your buildings go condo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>
All lift their wineglasses. All drink. All synchro- nously spit out their wine. All together now...
</DIRECTION>
<EVERYONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yechhh!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVERYONE>
<DIRECTION>
Charles lifts the wine bottle from the cooler. Disgust spans the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON bottle -- it bears the familiar spread wings of Thunderbird!
</DIRECTION>
<BERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thunderbird wine? My God, Delia, don't you even have a Safeway up here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERYL>
<DELIA>
<DIRECTION>
(horrified; but recovering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Joke Joke! Charles get the good wine and I'll serve the shrimp. It's a joke.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELIA>
<DIRECTION>
Delia stares a spike through Lydia. Delia and Charles rush into the kitchen. Otho looks at his glass and peers at Lydia.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Delia rushes to get the sushi. Charles finds some good wine.
</DIRECTION>
<DELIA>
<DIRECTION>
(rapidly; furious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lydia switched wines. Charles -- if you do not agree right now, to boarding school, you can forget having what you call sex -- ever again in your natural lifetime.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELIA>
<DIRECTION>
He nods reluctantly. She rushes back to guests.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lydia is looking around curiously. Delia and Charles rush back in with sushi and good wine. Delia pours for Bernard, the obvious connoisseur. He tastes the wine. All wait. Is it Kerosene du Pape? He smiles. All smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Otho is more interested in Lydia's story. He leans toward her...
</DIRECTION>
<OTHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, Lydia... Favor us about your ghosts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHO>
<DELIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! Do not encourage this little... person.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELIA>
<OTHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Delia, lighten up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHO>
<DELIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's been without therapy up here and I will not allow her to ruin...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELIA>
<DIRECTION>
But then:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DELIA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Something comes over her -- she straightens, then crouches a little, her hand sweeps across in front of her, almost mechanically. And then our Delia Deetz, unable to help herself, leaves the whitebread world behind and possessed, sings in someone else's voice, a rich, NEGRO TENOR.
</DIRECTION>
<DELIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"If I didn't care, More than words could say."
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELIA>
<DIRECTION>
Lydia's eyes widen. MUSIC UP. All the guests are spellbound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Charles, too, has the beat -- The Ink Spots in his eyes. In a voice not his own.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"If my every prayer, did not begin and end with just your name."
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>
Delia is shocked. She looks at Lydia.
</DIRECTION>
<DELIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For God's sake, stop me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELIA>
<DIRECTION>
She is cut short by her powerful inspiration.
</DIRECTION>
<DELIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"I could not be true to you beyond compare."
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELIA>
<DIRECTION>
ALL THE GUESTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
except Lydia, are possessed to become the chorus. They stand by their chairs, they spin in perfect Motown choreography.
</DIRECTION>
<EVERYONE>
<DIRECTION>
(except Lydia)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Shoo doo wop. Shoo doo wop."
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVERYONE>
<DELIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"If I didn't care... for you..."
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELIA>
<EVERYONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Shoo doo wop. Shoo doo wop."
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVERYONE>
<DIRECTION>
A look of sheer delight comes across Lydia's face, unlike anything we have previously seen. She dances and claps her hands in time with the music. She is in teen heaven.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NOTE: Delia and the guests are fully aware of their singing/actions, but helpless to stop themselves. While it is funny, it is nevertheless just a little frighten- ing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lydia excitedly looks around the room to see if she can see the ghosts. She can't.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now the song pauses... Everyone tries to recover for a shocked second. Instead, the tempo changes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the tempo quickens, the guest/chorus is syncopated like alternating pistons as they are pushed and pulled into their chairs. They sing throughout.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SONG
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
crashes to its end. Bernard looks down at his shrimp cocktail. The shrimp draped over the rice roll suddenly rears up like a hand and, making a tiny fist, grabs his dangling tie and... smash --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER -- All the guests are punched by the shrimp, back over their chairs to the ground. They are stunned. Suddenly everyone runs frightened into the next room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT./INT. ATTIC ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adam and Barbara with huge smiles on their faces, dance the bugaloo then hug and kiss on the landing in front of the attic. Door is open.
</DIRECTION>
<TOGETHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We did it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOGETHER>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's watch 'em scatter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
They enter the attic and run to the window. Look out over the front yard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
YARD OF HOUSE - THEIR POV - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
filled with the cars of the guests, as well as Delia and Charles' vehicles.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Any minute now. They'll all run screaming.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They wait. Nothing moving outside.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your Ink Spots were wonderful!
	</DIALOGUE>

Adam smiles proudly.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And your shrimp was remarkable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My shrimp? I did the wine. Didn't you do the sushi?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<ADAM>

	N... No, I just did the Ink Spots.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who did the?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
Timid KNOCK at the door of the attic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barbara glances at Adam. They don't know what to do.
</DIRECTION>
<LYDIA>
<DIRECTION>
(from outside the door)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's me. Lydia.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<DIRECTION>
Adam, puzzled, goes to the door and opens it. Lydia is standing there, sheepish.
</DIRECTION>
<LYDIA>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They'd like for you to come downstairs. Delia says you can pick any sheets you want.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The guests are sitting expectantly. The photographs are being passed around. The wheels are turning in Charles' mind -- he sees a gold mine. Everyone speaks at once.
</DIRECTION>
<DELIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It does indicate a marvelously urbane sense of humor on the part of these ghosts -- that they actually appear in sheets!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELIA>
<OTHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're dealing with Tracy and Hepburn here, a very sophisticated pair. We must protect them, treat them with respect. Nurture them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHO>

	<DIALOGUE>
	People will pay big money for this. Right, Grace?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<GRACE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Charles, I want to know why you didn't tell me about this --

<DELIA>
<DIRECTION>
(now changing her tune)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We were waiting for proof. Lydia's photographs...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELIA>
<DIRECTION>
Charles is scheming.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNARD>
<DIRECTION>
(skeptical)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you all talking about? We... we just got a little drunk, that's all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNARD>
<OTHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No matter how drunk you get, you cannot sound like the Ink Spots.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Charles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Charles, this is it! You can get Maxie Dean up here now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHO>
<DIRECTION>
Charles plots and plans.
</DIRECTION>
<OTHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His wife Sarah loves the supernatural. I did a reading for her just last week. Told her her jowls would tighten soon. I mean she will make him sprint up here in his helicopter if you can produce ghosts for her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHO>
<BERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The "Enquirer" has offered fifty thousand dollars for absolute proof of life after death. I'll send them over.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERYL>
<BERNARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm Delia's agent! I've lost money for years on her work. If anything actually happened here, I'll handle it, thank you. But not until I see some real proof.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNARD>
<DIRECTION>
Lydia appears at the base of the stairs. Everyone stops squabbling, looks at her expectantly.
</DIRECTION>
<LYDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They don't want to come down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<OTHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHO>
<DIRECTION>
Bernard shakes his head as if all this were an elaborate hoax. He harumphs!
</DIRECTION>
<LYDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think the reason is they were trying to scare you, and you didn't get scared --
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<DELIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course we weren't scared.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looking around)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a little startled. One of those shrimp dropped down my Kamali.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELIA>
<DIRECTION>
Bernard is now convinced this whole business was a put- on.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNARD>
<DIRECTION>
(shaking his head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Total collective hallucination.

</BERNARD>
<BERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was a little tipsie.

	This was not a hallucination, people. This was real, really totally real.

They exit. Delia is horrified and embarrassed.

	Shhhh. They didn't commit suicide.

Charles is suddenly transfixed. He stares at the model.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLES>

Otho pockets the handbook secretly as everyone exits. Delia carefully closes the door.

EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Barbara and Adam are hanging outside the window. CAMERA EASES BACK to see that instead of hanging from the house --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are hanging from a ledge over The Inferno --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON INFERNO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
circles of rosy hell. Several devilish Monsters slaver up at them, hoping for new meat for the furnace. Small geysers spurt foul gasses.

POV -- down the handrail, as they walk downstairs. Lydia lags behind, sullen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOWER END OF THE HANDRAIL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
lifts, and turns. The handrail has become a long, fat, diamond-backed snake -- unlike any we have ever seen. It flashes terrifying steel teeth and a red-feathered comb. It turns and HISSES at them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON DELIA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She screams as she looks down at her hand on the rail -- it grips the scaly, throbbing, dripping body of the snake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SNAKE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
just gets longer and nastier as it turns back in the air, up the stairs toward them. Its tail circles Delia and spins her like a top. When she stops -- the snake gives her a big wet snake kiss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SNAKE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
snaps Otho in the behind. It hurts.

THE SNAKE

<DIRECTION>
ALL THREE

THE SNAKE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
hovers horribly over them. Grabs Charles in its coils and squeezes him hard -- his fearful face reddens, then it suspends Charles over the edge of the stairs.

shrinks and turns back into the regular mahogany hand- rail.

	Great choice we've got here. We get to spend the next century either hanging out that window or doing parlor tricks.

Adam is working with the model town. Barbara is pac- ing.

Betelgeuse has run a beat-up old pickup into a fire hydrant. He stands nearby, hopping mad; shakes his fist at Adam.

CLOSEUP - BETELGEUSE IN BARBARA'S HAND

Betelgeuse grins. Suddenly large spikes shoot out all over his body, piercing the skin of Barbara's palm and fingers. Barbara's blood is a rich pink.

She squeals and releases the evil spirit and he plum- mets.

He turns the corner to a whorehouse, with women -- women with demon horns -- hanging out of the window, beckoning. Betelgeuse rubs his hands together and swaggers inside.

Lydia melodramatically dressed in a long black dress appears carrying a candle. She is softly crying.

She scratches that out.

Lydia looks behind her. A greet beetle the size of a Volkswagen is crouching. Its feathery antennae reach out toward her menacingly. Lydia yelps.

</BARBARA>
<JUNO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forget him. He'll remain with his whores until someone calls him. You need to worry about people like Otho. There are a lot of phony trance mediums. They usually can't make the formulas work, but if Otho stumbles on the right words in that handbook... he could hurt you. As in -- exorcism.

They both look puzzled.

<JUNO>

Barbara and Adam slowly stand and walk out the door. Barbara/Monster looks back pleadingly. Football players flood into Juno's office. One PARTICULARLY DUMB PLAYER has a revelation. (He's pretty grisly, maybe sat too close to the engine.)

Lydia screams, Adam/Monster tries to calm her. Lydia struggles and, thinking she is being attacked, runs out the door. Smack into Barbara/Monster.

Barbara catches her, frightens Lydia even more. Barbara holds onto her as she struggles. Barbara/ Monster slowly changes back into regular Barbara. Lydia sees who it is and she hugs her. Like mother and daughter.

Barbara hugs her. She fumbles for words. This is an unusual situation, a dead person talking a live person out of killing herself. She rocks Lydia a little. Barbara looks at Adam.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lydia, believe me... we know... all the hard stuff is the same over here. You're going to be who you are... whether you're alive or dead... and over here -- it's... It's flat... there's no food, no colors... you can't smell the flowers.

Lydia walks into a presentation in progress. Sitting around the table are Otho, Maxie, and Delia. Sarah Dean is there, too. She looks around Lydia hoping for ghosts. Sarah is heavily made up, smells bad.
</DIRECTION>

Lydia's photos of the sheeted ghosts are blown up and standing on a nearby easel. Charles, over the model with a pointer, is lost in mid-sentence.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLES>

	-- In short, I've got options to buy enough of Main Street to control the city council for a hundred years. And at the prices I'm talking about, if it all fell apart tomorrow, we just move out and sell to the Arabs and we still come out... I've talked to Ed Cornwall about a wax museum, here... in Thanksgiving Park... Ed's the man who made the talking Jesse Jackson statue. And I've got a museum dedicated to 50 Great Moments in the Paranormal -- and parenthetically, D-Con wants to the right to start an insect zoo here in the old hardware store.

	Are they here yet?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAH>
<MAXIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Charles, let's cut the bullcorn. We're here to see ghosts. This whole ghost town museum and such like follows a train, if you've got the engine... so let's see your goddamned engine.

Sarah is disappointed. She goes to Maxie. Delia takes over.

Barbara with her arm on his shoulder, talks to Adam.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've been given a gift here, honey. A real live little girl. She likes us a lot. She needs us. Maybe that's why we died so young, to keep us from getting so... attached to things. The house, antiques, your model. Look at us. We didn't have room for anyone.

Barbara slowly smiles. He does too.

He turns to Barbara. CAMERA HINGES WITH him to see --

Her face is frightened. She cannot speak. She reaches out to him -- but is disappearing. He reaches for her but she is suddenly -- GONE.

<DIRECTION>
ON THE DRESS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barbara's wedding dress floats over the table and fills slowly, painfully, with the arms, legs and finally the frightened face of Barbara. A lightning bolt flares.

Lydia rises slowly to her feet, unable to resist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
More lightning bolts.

Lydia walks slowly toward Barbara.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON BARBARA

ON LYDIA

<LYDIA>
<DIRECTION>
(hangs her head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was gross. They wanted me to dissect a frog. I told them no way. I said it was against my religion. I got a C.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>

Adam frowns a little.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>

	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
ON LYDIA -- she puts down her books. Loosens her collar, ruffles her hair and waits.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)

Lydia looks down. Lydia begins to levitate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She lifts her head and leaves the white bread world behind! In a voice as deep and soulful as Percy Sledge:
</DIRECTION>
<LYDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"When a man loves a woman. He can't keep his mind on nothin' else."
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<DIRECTION>
Behind her ghostly images of the football players appear as back-up.

MUSIC CONTINUES OVER:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A great pile of sand with the whorehouse in the middle. An irritated Betelgeuse crawls out on the roof. Hating the singing he shakes his fist at the sky -- loses his footing and tumbles into the sand. Terrified, he scrambles to get out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON PILE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A moving coil under the sand sends him scurrying inside again. The Sandworm SNAPPING right behind him as he runs back out on the roof.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA TILTS UP to see house. It is the perfect, New England house. CAMERA PULLS BACK from the model -- out the window of the real house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Outside the real house -- we see it is dilapidated, and undeniably, the perfect haunted house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT.
</DIRECTION>
