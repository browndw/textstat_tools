Inside a bed of ice, Emma is lowered by hydraulic machine into a steel radioactive thermal chamber, glowing eerily blue

FROM EMMA'S POV

Suddenly a BLIP. Something wrong.

Emma counterattacks. Slashes with the sabre and the teddy's head goes flying off! Jesus. The torso stands unsteadily.

Emma looks. Beneath a starlit sky criss-crossed by wires, a rooftop maze of buildings, flanked by giant gargoyles -- goblins, lions, griffins -- over twinkling lights ...

Emma searches the roof -- no sign, only shadows. Then turns a corner to see --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Above the city, fairy lights on the rooftops of Harrods, lit by a million bulbs ... giant neon signs ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Several floors below, Emma sees the streets. A twinge of vertigo. Then she looks up, hears a NOISE -- From:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEHIND GARGOYLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
she sees her "double" run. Emma gives chase.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hot pursuit. Over rooftops. 'Round wires. PAST neon signs high over the city ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Emma follows. Gains on the "double," who --
</DIRECTION>

Pushes faster. Gliding between rooftop buildings. Dodging, weaving. But Emma gains more. Sleek limbs, muscular, perfect body machine, until --

as she sees her "double" leap over a yawning chasm. And stumble on the other side for a footing.

Jumps! Hangs in the air. Limbs pushing out for the edge. And only just, she lands perfectly, gaining, closing, until --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON NEXT ROOFTOP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Emma gains up close. A final burst of acceleration. Then without warning, her "double" --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Turns, Emma catches up, and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wham! Wham! A kick -- a chop to Emma's body - double scissorkick -- Emma reacts swiftly, surges into overdrive --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a lightning-fast kung fu duel -- CRACK OF BONE -- CRUNCH OF BLOWS -- a flurry of kicks as Emma --

Lands on her back. The "double" attacks. Emma retaliates --

Kicks up her leg -- flings the "double" over her head she lands awkwardly -- a METALLIC CRUNCH in a blow to her head -- but picks herself up without pausing
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And vanishes into the rooftop maze.

AGAINST SKYLINE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Emma stands. Looks. She's lost her "double." She stands alone, silhouetted against the night sky.

Caught in the moonlight. Above sparks of neon. Daunting, muscular, poised for action, as --

as a cable wire whips across, coils 'round Emma, lashing her tight, crushing air from her, as the wire --

Sweeps Emma off her feet, whiplashes her back like a spring, hoists her and dangles her over the city. She looks down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A long way.
</DIRECTION>

Emma grabs hold of the wire, which pulls her back. She drops down to the rooftop ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slithers down the roof. Slips --

Another CABLE for her to hold. It uncoils down past the windows, telltale SPARKS flare up as it hits metal --

On a lawn, a peacock flares its thousand eye tail. A MECHANICAL CLICK, its eyes conceal hidden cameras, recording Emma, Steed and the Old Lady, who've landed inside the walled grounds. They move stealthily forward, unaware ...
</DIRECTION>
<OLD_LADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Over here ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_LADY>
<DIRECTION>
The Old Lady waves them on. They enter a tunnel into
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MAZE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tall hedges surround Steed and Emma and the Old Lady on all sides. They follow the path, slopes , round, curves, turns into hairpin bends and U-turns. At first intrigued ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then perplexed. Emma leads the way, Steed following. The Old Lady slips OUT OF VIEW. Steed stops to pick a rose, puts it in his lapel. Emma rushes ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<EMMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aha ... Yes ... It's clear now. A trapezoid shape, dictated by twin diagonal paths and a single curving path. A late Seventeenth Century design, originally for King William of Orange, copied... Ah ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMMA>
<DIRECTION>
Steed sees Emma slip 'round a corner. He pursues her. Glimpses her. Then loses her. Another glimpse. Sees her thru hedges, then seemingly --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thru the other side of the hedge. In two places at once.
</DIRECTION>
<STEED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Mrs. Peel? I think I'm seeing double again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEED>
<DIRECTION>
Out of sight, Emma rushes on. Around her, the hedges grow taller. She seems to grow smaller. Emma begins to realize things are not what they seem. As she pushes her way thru --
</DIRECTION>

A pattern on a screen. The lines of the maze reformulated as abstract lines. Steed, Emma and the Old Lady as three flashing dots. Someone, somewhere is watching them. Laughter, then a familiar voice --

Emma sees a statue of a Butler. Which springs to life. Summons Emma. She follows down a path strewn with leaves.

As Emma steps on the leaves, she --

Steed hears a noise, turns to see --

Emma walking towards him. She picks the rose from his lapel, slowly coils an arm around his neck. Pulls Steed towards her, closes her eyes -- kisses him full an the mouth.

Inside the house, a grand hall. Deserted. A cobweb hangs from ceiling. A velvet curtain tattered and torn. Emma.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CUCKOO CLOCK RINGS the hour. Ahead, the real Emma sees --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A giant staircase. There on the stairs -- a glass eye. She picks it up. Puts it in a pocket. Emma goes --

UPSTAIRS

Sees a series of family portraits an the staircase. One of herself in ornate aristocratic regalia.

Then Emma turns into a whole room of ...

THUNDER and lightning outside. Inside the room of snow shakers, a CHILDHOOD TUNE PLAYS. Emma shakes the snow scene. The weather seems to grow darker.

FROM BEHIND

<DIRECTION>
Emma hears the unmistakable chilling voice:
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wouldn't shake that too hard. The weather might turn nasty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>

From the shadows ... a man. A silhouette. Behind a distorting lens. His shape and face unclear. Emma puts down the shaker.

Instinctively Emma moves towards him. A long pause.

<EMMA>
	<DIALOGUE>

Emma pulls back. Before she can turn, Peter takes her hand, places it over his heart. BA-BOOM, BA-BOOM, BA-BOOM ...

<PETER>

Peter touches her hand. Emma looks into his eyes. Intrigued but alarmed, disbelief. Peter raises her hand to his lips.

<DIRECTION>
Peter comes over, folds her in his arms. Takes her head between his hands. Emma leans over to him, about to kiss him, both closing their eyes, until --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lips parted. Before they kiss, Emma pulls back --
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be afraid, darling.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<DIRECTION>
She turns, runs to the door. Like a trapped bird. She tries the door -- locked. Another door -- locked. A window -- locked.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't run away. I forgive you, Emma. I know you left me. But I still love you. Do you still have my ring? I need it.

<DIRECTION>
Peter grabs hold of Emma. She pulls away. Emma sees his face before her, pleading with her. Seductive yet nightmarish.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As if hallucinating, Emma runs away, towards --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The big window overlooking the gardens. She runs, leaps, and in SLOW MOTION --

Crashes thru the GLASS, shards and splinters SHATTERING all 'round her, as she --

Dr. Darling furls his hand over Emma's, his fingers resting upon her ring. During the interrogation, he soothingly strokes her hand -- tries to remove the ring without arousing her suspicion. Pulls gently on it.

A medieval country church. Sunlight streams through stained glass, illumining Emma as Steed watches her lay --

A red rose by an altar tomb: an ornate mausoleum two hands clasped in a pose of eternal sleep: Peter Peel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Emma pauses, as in the b.g., choirboys sing hymn practice. Steed watches Emma move away, toward the door. He drops a hymn book. Emma swivels round -- sees Steed.

Emma above. He follows her. Hears her footsteps. Trip- trapping up the spiral staircase. Steed listens, follows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UP BELLTOWER

From below, Steed hears a BELL RING. A FLUTTER of BIRDS. As debris falls down -- Steed runs up stairs, reaches --

:SC: EXT. BELLTOWER TOP - DAY

<DIRECTION>
BELL still RINGING. At the top, a sheer drop. Steed edges closer to the ledge. Looks. A long way down. From behind --

<EMMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A long way down.

</EMMA>

Steed swivels. Sees Emma blocking his path. Cool menace. Steed steps away from the edge, Emma circles him.
</DIRECTION>
<STEED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Careful. You might fall.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEED>
<DIRECTION>
Emma steps to the edge. Steed freezes. Emma locks down. Feet resting on the ledge. Rocking to and fro ...
</DIRECTION>
<EMMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could save you the trouble.

Steed reaches out for her. Holds out his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<EMMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And do you trust me?

<STEED>
	<DIALOGUE>

Steed snatches her from the edge, holds her in his arms.
</DIRECTION>
<STEED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need proof.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEED>
<DIRECTION>
Emma thinks. Looks at him. Deadly serious. Their eyes lock. She hesitates, then pecks him on the cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<STEED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was longer. On the lips.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEED>
<DIRECTION>
Emma hesitates. Then a kiss on the lips. Longer. But not much. Steed grabs her hand, pulls her back.
</DIRECTION>
<STEED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Much longer. Approximately ... fifteen seconds.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEED>
<DIRECTION>
Emma harumphs, exasperated. Moves closer to him.
</DIRECTION>
<EMMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Ready?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMMA>

Steed nods. Emma leans forward. A full kiss. At first reticent ... Emma looks at her watch. Counts seconds ...

<EMMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that all?

The kiss continues couple of seconds longer. Before Emma withdraws. With an effort, she regains her composure. A long silence.
</DIRECTION>
<EMMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So I'm in the clear?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMMA>
<DIRECTION>
Steed savors the kiss. No reply. His smile says it all.
</DIRECTION>
<EMMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you did suspect me.

Emma motions. Steed goes down, passes close to the edge, and swivels round nervously. Emma reads his thoughts.
</DIRECTION>
<EMMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When it happens, Steed, you'll be the first to know ...

A tranquil village scene. Choirboys walk out from the church. Nearby in the deserted village street. A red PHONE BOX. Which ...

<DIRECTION>
RING-RING ... Starts to RING.
</DIRECTION>
<EMMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who could that be?
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
A ROLL of THUNDER. Steed looks up: a clear sky. He's puzzled. Suddenly suspicious. As Emma moves to the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<STEED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No -- don't answer it ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEED>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls her back. Emma looks at him.
</DIRECTION>
<STEED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's it. The phones trigger the explosions --
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEED>
<DIRECTION>
RING-RING ... Another ROLL of THUNDER. Steed connects the two as -- an angelic CHOIRBOY walks towards the phone ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RING-RING ... A LOUDER ROLL of THUNDER. As the Choirboy nears the PHONE, Steed shouts --

<DIRECTION>
RING-RING -- the PHONE in the f.g. as the choirboy closes in, opens the door --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE PHONE BOX
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door shuts. Noise muffled. The Choirboy can't hear Steed and Emma's shouted warnings, as he lifts his hand up, and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUTSIDE

Steed sees him reach out, warns the vicar and choirboys.

<STEED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get down -- get down -- it's going to explode -- !

</STEED>

Steed and Emma, all the choirboys hit the dirt, as

INSIDE PHONE BOX

The Choirboy grabs the phone, and lifts it up, and
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No explosion. A few seconds pass. Steed and everyone are down on the ground. As they see --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FROM PHONE BOX
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- the Choirboy leaves the phone hanging. He gets out, scans the crowd. Then walks calmly over to Steed, who's still prone.
</DIRECTION>
<CHOIRBOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's your mother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHOIRBOY>

The vicar and choirboys look on sympathetically, as --

Steed dusts himself off. Emma and everyone gets up. Steed goes to the phone box, takes the call.
</DIRECTION>
<STEED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mother? How did you find me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEED>

His expression changes as he listens. Emma goes to the phone box as Steed rings off. He emerges from the box.

Butlers walk past in military file, carrying elaborate displays of lobster and meats. Steed steals --

The man and butlers haul away several ministers, and --

Steed trips the butler with his umbrella, then chops him down on the ground. He rises but Emma kicks him into as --

Behind them Steed sees the lab-coated man escape up the stairs, protected by a posse of butlers. He shouts --

Emma hesitates. Then turns, heads for an ornate dual shaft elevator. She bangs the button, gets inside, doors shut, as the BULLETS from MACHINE-GUNNING gas masked butlers strike the brass door as --

Steed whips his rapier from his umbrella and duels with the butlers. To give Emma time, he uses every trick and prop at his disposal, plus, brute force to --

Punches -- kicks -- stabs the other butler, a more brutish type, who recovers enough to grab Emma by the throat.

Scrambles for the grenade. Picks it up. It slips out of her hands. Scrambles more. It slips out ...

Steed stealing down a corridor and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
hides, as a posse of guards rushes past, alerted by the peacock cameras. He waits till they pass, then reaches out his umbrella, and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nabs Father around the neck who was feeling her way after them. Brings her down.

	You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ...

<STEED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was you who gave Valentine Peel his security clearance ... you're the mole who betrayed the Ministry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEED>
<FATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mother betrayed me. She was going to replace me with a younger Father. Errand boy that's all I was. 'Find Steed...'
	</DIALOGUE>

<STEED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you found me. Have a sniff of this, why don't you? Careful, the scent can be overpowering ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEED>
<DIRECTION>
Holding Father securely, Steed forces her nose into his rose boutonniere, squeezes the rubber tube, sprays a Mist. Father passes out. Steed rises, locks around. Sees --

A grille and removes it, climbs in and replaces it before the guards return. He turns and --

crawls forward through a mass of wires and plumbing -- until he hears a VOICE -- VALENTINE'S.

Steed reaches another grille, through which he can see --

Emma's coffin, standing on end, like the Iron Maiden faces a wall of TV monitors as Valentine explains.
</DIRECTION>
<VALENTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	People expect weather to be free. They're used to it. I call that a denial of freedom. No freedom of choice. An abuse of human rights. They buy water, electricity, gas. Why shouldn't they be able to buy their own weather if they want to? If they have a little incentive ...

Emma reacts -- also Steed (unseen) behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<EMMA>

<EMMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then what's stopping you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMMA>
<VALENTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One very small thing. A diamond 'cyclone' chip. A thousand times more information on a fraction of the size. If I possess that, my powers would be unlimited. My dear half-brother was developing it. But he suspected sabotage. He gave the chip to ... you, 'Mrs.' Peel. I want you. But also your ring.

Valentine takes her by the hand. Kisses --

<VALENTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The missing piece of the jigsaw. I tried to get you to give it to me as Peter; I tried to steal it from you as Dr. Darling. As myself I'll be a bit less subtle.

(he slips it off her finger; holds it up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With this ring my plan will be complete.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTINE>
<EMMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How Wagnerian ... Do you mean to say you've waited all these years because you couldn't create a chip on your own? That would have amused Peter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMMA>
<VALENTINE>

	Speaking of Peter, there's more good news: You won't even have to change your last name. You'll always be Mrs. Peel.

Valentine is philosophical. He spins the sarcophagus on an axis, lying it flat -- Emma lying in her coffin as he looks down at her --
</DIRECTION>
<VALENTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One out of two isn't bad. I'll keep you alive, darling Emma. In a year or five, you may change your mind. If you're still in it.

</VALENTINE>
<DIRECTION>
Valentine presses a button. From the ceiling -- a surgical laser. Moves down to within inches of her face.
</DIRECTION>
<VALENTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This little toy gave me back my face. It can replace yours. What do you think? Medusa? Madame Defarge? Maggie Thatcher?

	Ah. That will be Steed. He followed you. Please excuse me. I have work to do. My most spectacular performance. A ballet of clouds. It was made for you. I want to give you a heart, Emma. I want all of London to see it. And now with this ...

He stuffs a gag into Emma's mouth and closes the coffin on her muffled protests. Darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Immediately, Steed tries to force his way through the grille. No such luck.
</DIRECTION>
<STEED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Blast. What to do? Mrs. Peel!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEED>

He doesn't dare say her name too loud -- and there's no telling if she could hear him in that thing, anyway.

He turns around in the tunnel -- heads the other way.

<DIRECTION>
Pitch dark, then --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Emma's coffin is opened and we see Bad Emma, looking down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bad Emma stares at her human double -- Emma: who looks imploringly at her to undo the gag. Bad Emma removes it, she --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Runs a finger down Emma's body, inside a hole torn in the leather -- warm human flesh. Blood. Her flesh. Her blood. Fascinated.
</DIRECTION>
<EMMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must let me go ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMMA>
<DIRECTION>
Bad Emma listens. Gently lays her head on Emma's breast, listens to -- the HEARTBEAT. Ba-boom. Ba-boom ...
</DIRECTION>
<EMMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you understand? If he has me, he'll have no use for you ... he'll destroy you ...
	</DIALOGUE>

The words jolt Bad Emma back, remembering her mission. She goes to the laser, aims it at Emma's face!

Bad Emma hesitates, looks strangely human as --

</DIRECTION>
<STEED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, dear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEED>
<DIRECTION>
No escape. He takes off his bowler -- deftly removes a strip from its brim, aims it at the guards, and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hurls it ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP - BOWLER (IN FLIGHT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A glinting razor's edge, which --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Swoosh -- ! Slices into the closest guard before returning, like a boomerang to Steed. He taps twice hard steel as ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OTHER GUARDS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
run towards him, Steed swivels gracefully and - slams the bowler in their faces, a sartorial knuckleduster -- wham -- ! One drops -- Bam -- ! The other collapses, slump to the ground. Steed stoops down, picks up his hat, sees --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A dent in its steel top. For the first time, Steed loses his cool. Genuine rage.
</DIRECTION>
<STEED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Someone's going to pay for this.

Stepping over the nearest body, Steed moves on his way, as --

As the life is squeezed out of him, Bad Emma finally smiles. Cradled together, she chokes Valentine, who gasps for breath, as --

One last desperate move on his part and Bad Emma tumbles backwards, Valentine locked in her arms in a dying embrace.

Steed picks up her limp body in his arms like "Sleeping Beauty." His eyes fill with tears. He lays her down.

He produces Peter's ring.

CLOSEUP - RING

<DIRECTION>
Slips it onto her finger and ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kisses her. A chaste kiss on the lips. But with the force and passion of a lover. He closes his eyes, looks away in grief. The ALARM STILL SOUNDS but Steed doesn't give a damn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind, Emma opens her eyes. As if revived by the kiss. Or the ring. Looks up at him.

Emma scrambles in and Steed leaps on top of her, bringing down the lid as ...

SEVERAL ANGLES

3-2-1 -- and a BLAST like a nuclear EXPLOSION -- as the Underground HQ is fragmented to smithereens -- Emma's " coffin" goes flying ... as the SCREEN WHITES OUT.

A few weeks later. Across snowy wastes, a pack of Huskies drag a sled behind them, WHIP CRACKED by a --

Frozen fur-clad Siberian peasant. As he turns a corner, dogs stumble from ice and snow into --

SAND

The peasant stops, stares.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AHEAD OF HIM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sun beats down. A tropical beach. A warm sea. A butler, Trubshaw. POPS a CHAMPAGNE CORK. From a tent, he brings two glasses down the beach to

TWO DIVAN-STYLE DECK CHAIRS

Where Steed and Emma toast in the sun. Steed in a smoking jacket, Emma in a bikini.

Steed seems peeved that his chance to be alone with EMMA is spoiled. Trubshaw pours glasses of champagne.
</DIRECTION>
<STEED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Still a little warm, Trubshaw. Is this the '28? A little more ice, I think ...

Trubshaw trots off dutifully. A large ice bucket appears. Mother moves in. Absorbed by Emma, now his new protegee.

Steed gives his champagne to the Siberian peasant. He presses a switch -- an umbrella shoots up between them, opens up, twirls.
</DIRECTION>

PULL BACK to reveal the strip of beach, like a tiny bubble of tropical weather. Against a Siberian b.g. of snow. As we WIDEN we REVEAL a giant glass bubble, hearing --
