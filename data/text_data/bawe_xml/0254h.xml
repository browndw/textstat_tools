<p>The British Academic Written English (BAWE) corpus was developed at the Universities of Warwick, Reading and Oxford Brookes, under the directorship of Hilary Nesi and Sheena Gardner (formerly of the Centre for Applied Linguistics [previously called CELTE], Warwick), Paul Thompson (Department of Applied Linguistics, Reading) and Paul Wickens (Westminster Institute of Education, Oxford Brookes), with funding from the ESRC. Subject to the rights of the these institutions in the BAWE corpus, and pursuant to the ESRC agreement, the BAWE corpus is available to researchers for research purposes PROVIDED THAT the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>1. The corpus files are not distributed in either their original form or in modified form.</p>
<p>2. The texts are used for research purposes only; they should not be reproduced in teaching materials.</p>
<p>3. The texts are not reproduced in full for a wider audience/readership, although researchers are free to quote short passages of text (up to 200 running words from any given text).</p>
<p>4. The BAWE corpus developers (contact: BAWE@warwick.ac.uk) are informed of all projects, dissertations, theses, presentations or publications arising from analysis of the corpus.</p>
<p>5. Researchers acknowledge their use of the corpus using the following form of words: "The data in this study come from the British Academic Written English (BAWE) corpus, which was developed at the Universities of Warwick, Reading and Oxford Brookes under the directorship of Hilary Nesi and Sheena Gardner (formerly of the Centre for Applied Linguistics [previously called CELTE], Warwick), Paul Thompson (Department of Applied Linguistics, Reading) and Paul Wickens (Westminster Institute of Education, Oxford Brookes), with funding from the ESRC (RES-000-23-0800)."</p>

<s n="s3.9;p96.99">In order to find out which dimension of heat exchanger is the best one for the waste heat recovery system, surface 9.03 (Reference 3) is tested with these different sizes of heat exchanger. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p96.99">Finally, the best one is 400x400x500mm, which gives the shortest payback time between the six optional overall sizes. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p96.99">After determination of heat exchanger's dimension, best fin geometry has to be chosen for the system. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p96.99">In the spreadsheet, four fin geometries are considered, which are surface 5.3, surface 6.2, surface 9.03 and surface 11.1 (Reference 3). </s>
<s n="s7.9;p96.99">From the spreadsheet, it shows that values of oil saved for these different surfaces are £76.9, £74.5, £90.3 and £104.1 respectively. </s>

<s n="s3.4;p97.99">Obviously, the first two choices are impossible, since the payback time can not be negative, and lifetime of the system is 10 years only. </s>

<p n="p98.99">
<s n="s1.4;p98.99">In terms of surface geometry, louvered fins are not taken into account, because the calculated pressure drop in the heat exchanger with louvered fins is greater than 300Pa, which is not satisfied with the assignment. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p98.99">In the spreadsheet, four plate-fin surfaces are considered. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p98.99">Surface 9.03 and surface 11.1 have got shorter payback time than the others, and the payback time is nearly identical, but their values of oil saved are different, hence, the return over its lifetime is different. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p98.99">The maximum one goes with surface 11.1, which is £581.3, while the one with surface 9.03 is £441.5. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p99.99">To conclude, the most cost-effective waste heat recovery system should choose surface 9.03 with 400x400x500mm heat exchanger or surface 11.1 with 400x400x500mm heat exchanger, since their payback time are minimum, which are 5.11 years and 4.41 years respectively. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p99.99">Furthermore, by considering maximum return over system's lifetime, the surface 11.1 with 400x400x500mm heat exchanger is the final choice, because its return over its lifetime is £139.8 more than the former one, which is £441.5. </s>
