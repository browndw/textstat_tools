<s n="s1.6;p2.26">A common modern method for measuring fluoride concentrations in water utilises the fluoride sensitive electrode invented by Frant and Ross [<ref target="BAWE_0415c-endnote.001"/>]. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p2.26">This electrode contains an internal fluoride standard and a LaF <hi rend="sub">3</hi> ion exchange crystal. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p2.26">LaF <hi rend="sub">3</hi> exhibits an affinity toward F-. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p2.26">The internal fluoride ion activity controls the potential of the inner surface of the LaF <hi rend="sub">3</hi> crystal. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p2.26">The test solution comes in contact with the other side of the crystal, and a potential difference is created across it, proportional to the ratio of ion activities on the inner and outer sides of the crystal [<ref target="BAWE_0415c-endnote.002"/>]. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p2.26">An external reference electrode is used to measure the potential of the fluoride electrode and thus the activity of F− in the test solution. </s>

<p n="p5.26">
<s n="s1.1;p5.26">Thus a calibration of the electrode using several standard solutions of fluoride allows us to measure the fluoride activity of an unknown solution. </s>

<p n="p6.26">
<s n="s1.1;p6.26">Several conditions need to be met in order to measure F− concentrations in this way. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.26">
<s n="s1.3;p7.26">Ionic activity coefficients are largely dependent upon ionic strength. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p7.26">Samples prepared for measurement must have a high ionic strength relative to the contribution from fluoride. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p7.26">Stabilising ionic strength will make the fluoride activity coefficient relatively constant, so the measured potential becomes proportional to the fluoride concentration. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.26">
<s n="s1.5;p8.26">Competing chemical equilibria present an important source of error. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p8.26">The electrode is sensitive to hydroxide ions, but this is only significant its concentration exceeds that of fluoride [1]. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p8.26">Another pH dependent effect is due to the fact HF is a weak acid. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p8.26">Below pH 5, HF complexes will result in a decrease in measured fluoride activity. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p8.26">Prepared samples must have a pH between 5 and 7. </s>

<s n="s2.3;p9.26">Si <hi rend="sup">+4</hi>, Fe <hi rend="sup">+3</hi>, and Al <hi rend="sup">+3</hi> all form complexes with fluoride and thus interfere with measurements. </s>

<head rend="bold">Discussion</head>

<s n="s1.1;p21.26">The tap water fluoride concentration found in this experiment is only slightly less than the value of 0.079mM publised by Severn Trent Water. </s>
</p>
<p n="p22.26">
<s n="s1.1;p22.26">Tea infusion produced fluoride levels much higher than the researched values of between 0.032mM and 0.157mM. We now believe that these values are under-estimates. </s>
</p>
<p n="p23.26">
<s n="s1.3;p23.26">The problems that arise when dealing with very dilute (>0.05mM) solutions are highlighted by this experiment. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p23.26">The multiple dilution method employed meant that the weakest standard had a large percentage uncertainty, reflected by the error bars on the calibration graph. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p23.26">Although this means that we do not have an accurate value for the potential reading at such great dilution, the data at higher concentrations follows the Nernstian relationship closely such that extrapolation to lower concentrations can be done with confidence. </s>
</p>
<p n="p24.26">
<s n="s1.3;p24.26">Although this experiment presents a rigorous method for assessing fluoride concentrations, there is scope for improvement. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p24.26">If time allowed, the NaF used for the standard solutions would have been oven dried for 2hours at 110º to remove any traces of water that would contribute to inaccurate fluoride standards. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p24.26">A TISAB (Total Ionic Strength Adjustment Buffer) would have been prepared containing the buffer and a chelating agent to remove interferences from polyvalent cations which would further improve experimental accuracy [<ref target="BAWE_0415c-endnote.005"/>]. </s>

<p n="p25.26">
<s n="s1.4;p25.26">Test solution temperature was controlled in this experiment to 295 ± 0.5K. A more accurate method of temperature control would utilise a thermostat bath. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p25.26">The electrode calibration curve not only shifts but changes slope with changes in temperature. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p25.26">It is estimated that a 1 degree change in temperature at 298K would result in a 2% error in the potential reading at the millimolar level. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p25.26">Whereas the effect of this on solutions of concentration above 0.005M is insignificant compared to the other sources of error in the experiment, solutions of below 0.0005M may suffer significantly from such a temperature difference. </s>
</p>
<p n="p26.26">
<s n="s1.4;p26.26">This report has assessed water fluoride concentrations and explored the effects of tea infusion upon such values. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p26.26">The factors leading to the greatest sources of inaccuracy referred to in the introduction were sucessfully controlled. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p26.26">Had time allowed, a more rigorous treatment of the uncertainties inherent to this method would have been conducted. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p26.26">Our findings show the experimental method was suitable for the task, but also highlight some of the problems that need to be addressed if this topic was to be studied further. </s>
