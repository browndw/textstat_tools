<s n="s3.12;p1.11">A key aspect of Darwin's ideas was that species were not immutable, that they could change in their essential characteristics. </s>
<s n="s4.12;p1.11">It had been a common belief that species were immutable because of the writings in the Bible. </s>
<s n="s5.12;p1.11">Genesis mentioned the species that God had created and it was assumed that only God could create new species. </s>
<s n="s6.12;p1.11">Darwin was worried about the implications of his ideas. </s>
<s n="s7.12;p1.11">In January 1844 he wrote to J. D. Hooker claiming that it was 'like confessing a murder'<ref target="BAWE_0013c-ftnote.001"/> to suggest that species were not immutable. </s>
<s n="s8.12;p1.11">However, many of Darwin's ideas had been in discussion by earlier natural historians and Romantic thinkers in the decades before he published his <hi rend="italic">Origin of Species by means of Natural Selection</hi> in 1859. </s>
<s n="s9.12;p1.11">Romanticism began in the mid-eighteenth century and reached its height in the nineteenth century. </s>
<s n="s10.12;p1.11">The Romantics questioned old beliefs, requiring proof before they believed in something. </s>
<s n="s11.12;p1.11">They would study nature closely and believed that man was closely linked with the natural world. </s>
<s n="s12.12;p1.11">In this way Darwin was also a Romantic thinker. </s>
