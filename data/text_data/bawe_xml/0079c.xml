<div1 type="abstract">
<head>Abstract</head>
<p>The concept of Credit Rationing (CR) has developed into a long-lasting debate in economic theory, since it implies that it may be rational for lenders not to increase the price (i.e. interest rate) when facing an excess demand for credit. This paper critically addresses the principal features of the Jaffee and Russell (1976) and Stiglitz and Weiss (1981) models in order to explain how the Imperfect Information assumption helps answer the question about CR. A critical review of the theoretical discussion is undertaken to set the ground for later empirical analysis on the Argentine case. The paper concludes that the assumption of Imperfect Information helps to explain CR via the presence of a non-monotonic relationship between the bankÂ´s expected profits and the interest rate charged on loans. Furthermore, the empirical evidence on the Argentine case suggests that CR may have affected those less-collateralized borrowers between 1996 and 2001.</p>

<head>Introduction</head>
<p n="p1.122">
<s n="s1.4;p1.122">The concept of Credit Rationing (CR) has a long-lasting tradition in economic theory <hi rend="sup">1</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p1.122">The importance of the CR phenomenon arises because it assumes that prices may not adjust in credit markets in the way assumed by the conventional auctioneer mechanism. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p1.122">When an excess demand for a good prevails in any market, prices will increase until such level as demand equals supply. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p1.122">On the other hand, if an excess demand for credit exists but the interest rate charged on loans does not increase to achieve equilibrium, a CR situation may occur. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.122">
<s n="s1.3;p2.122">The negative effects of such a situation on the efficient allocation of resources can be interpreted from both a micro and a macro perspective. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p2.122">Projects with high social return could not be undertaken and agents may not be able to smooth intertemporal consumption properly when credit is rationed (Jaffee and Stiglitz 1990). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p2.122">On the other hand, fluctuations in the availability of credit could induce macroeconomic cycles as well as distortions in the monetary policy transmission affecting the real output of the economy (McCallum 1991). </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.122">
<s n="s1.5;p3.122">The existence of CR has created an active debate as well as the construction of different theoretical frameworks to explain it. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p3.122">In the early 1950s, Paul Samuelson affirmed that "(...) non-price credit rationing was entirely inconsistent with profit-maximization bank behaviour (...)" (Baltensperger 1978, p.171). </s>
<s n="s3.5;p3.122">Starting with Hodgman (1960), a number of interpretations have been addressed to demonstrate that CR is consistent with competitive markets and rational behaviour. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p3.122">In particular, Hodgman (op cit., p.259) indicated that the primary issue in his work was to address the question of CR avoiding non-competitive market structures or exogenous limits on interest rates <hi rend="sup">2</hi>. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p3.122">By the same token, Jaffee and Modigliani (1969) asked if it is rational for a bank to limit the credit below the level demanded by borrowers when the interest rates and the amount of loanable funds are chosen according to profit maximization rules. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.122">
<s n="s1.4;p4.122">However, although these frameworks properly addressed credit markets' particular characteristics, they failed in constructing a consistent framework (Jaffee and Stiglitz 1990, p.853). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p4.122">Hodgman (1960) was unable to derive a non-monotonic loan supply function dependent on the interest rate, and CR was finally an <hi rend="italic">ad hoc</hi> consideration. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p4.122">Jaffee and Modigliani (1969) "implicity" assumed the banks' capacity to differentiate among borrowers and a positive and monotonic relationship between banks' expected profits and the interest rate charged on loans <hi rend="sup">3</hi>. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p4.122">Furthermore, they finally associated CR with institutional restrictions (Jaffee and Modigliani op cit., p. 860). </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.122">
<s n="s1.3;p5.122">After Akerlof's (1970) seminal paper, the imperfect information assumption was incorporated as a key element to explain CR. The first paper to incorporate this assumption was Jaffee and Russell (1976) with Moral Hazard considerations. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p5.122">Furthermore, Stiglitz and Weiss (1981) emphasized Adverse Selection problems. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p5.122">Nevertheless, there still remains an important debate about the empirical importance of CR as a consequence of Imperfect Information problems <hi rend="sup">4</hi>. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.122">
<s n="s1.1;p6.122">In this paper I will critically address the principal features of the Jaffee and Russell (1976) and Stiglitz and Weiss (1981) models to explain how the Imperfect Information assumption helps answer the question about CR. Following these frameworks, an empirical analysis will be provided to determine the CR's possible impact on the Argentine economy. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.122">
<s n="s1.2;p7.122">The principal conclusion of this paper is that the Imperfect Information assumption helps explain CR via the presence of a non-monotonic relationship between bank's expected profits and the loan interest rate. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p7.122">The empirical evidence on the Argentine case suggests that CR is a feature on those less-collateralized borrowers between 1996 and 2001. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.122">
<s n="s1.4;p8.122">The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p8.122">Section I introduces the definition of CR and Imperfect Information. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p8.122">In section II Jaffee and Russell (1976) and Stiglitz and Weiss (1981) are developed and discussed. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p8.122">Section III addresses a framework proposed by Berger and Udell (1992) to test the empirical evidence on Argentina, and Section IV concludes. </s>

<div1 type="section">
<head>I. Definitions</head>
<div2>
<head>A. Imperfect Information</head>
<p n="p9.122">
<s n="s1.3;p9.122">Following Jaffee and Stiglitz (1990) </s>
<s n="s2.3;p9.122">I will refer to Imperfect Information as opposed to Symmetric Information, to a situation in which "(...) borrowers and lenders do not have equal access to all available information (...)" (op cit., p.840). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p9.122">Asymmetric information is considered a particular case of Imperfect Information, with two different cases to be discussed in the paper: Moral Hazard (Hidden Actions) and Adverse Selection (Hidden Information). </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.122">
<s n="s1.2;p10.122">Moral Hazard refers to a situation whereby one part of an economic contract is unable to observe the actions carried out by the other part, and which may negatively affect the interest of one of the agents involved. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p10.122">Adverse Selection arises when trading decisions of one individual depend on privately-held information which adversely affects uniformed agents (Mas-Colellal. 1995). </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head>B. Credit Rationing</head>
<p n="p11.122">
<s n="s1.3;p11.122">The definition of CR includes a broad range of alternatives (See, Keeton 1979, Jaffee and Stiglitz 1990). </s>
<s n="s2.3;p11.122">Following Keeton (op cit., p.9), there are two types of Credit Rationing: Type <hi rend="italic">(1)</hi> refers to a situation where an individual receives a smaller-than-desired loan at the market interest rate; Type <hi rend="italic">(2)</hi> occurs when some firms or agents receive loans while others, identical from the lender's viewpoint, do not. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p11.122">Hereafter, CR will refer to the type <hi rend="italic">(2)</hi> stated above, i.e. an equilibrium situation since both, lenders and borrowers, are maximizing profits (that is, there is no economic rational incentive to depart from this situation). </s>
</p>
</div2>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head>II. Theoretical models</head>
<p n="p12.122">
<s n="s1.3;p12.122">The first theoretical model which includes the Imperfect Information assumption to explain CR was Jaffee and Russell (1976). </s>
<s n="s2.3;p12.122">The presence of Moral Hazard behaviour by a group of borrowers who are indistinguishable <hi rend="italic">ex ante</hi> by banks, in the form of an incentive to default on the loan, explains why banks may decide not to increase the interest rate above a certain level. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p12.122">In this situation it is possible to get an interest rate maximising bank's profits below the level at which the loanable funds market clears. </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.122">
<s n="s1.4;p13.122">On the other hand, Stiglitz and Weiss (1981) emphasised the Adverse Selection problem. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p13.122">In such a case, banks know that a positive relationship exists between the interest rate they charge on loans and the risk of each project. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p13.122">As the risk of the borrower's pool has a negative effect on the banks' expected profits, and banks are not able to distinguish among the risks of an individual project, they may decide not to increase the interest rate above certain level. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p13.122">Again, it is possible to get an interest rate which maximizes banks' expected profits below the clear-market level. </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.122">
<s n="s1.1;p14.122">In the following subsections I will address in depth both the Jaffee and Russell (op cit.) and the Stiglitz and Weiss (op cit.) models, finishing the section with a discussion on the criticism to the explanation of CR via the imperfect information assumption. </s>
</p>
<div2>
<head>A. Moral Hazard</head>
<p n="p15.122">
<s n="s1.6;p15.122">In Jaffee and Russell (1976) there are two types of agents: honest and dishonest. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p15.122">The assumption of how each of the two agent-types behaves is central to explain the Moral Hazard hypothesis. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p15.122">While the honest agents never default on their commitments <hi rend="sup">5</hi>, dishonest agents do this under certain conditions. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p15.122">If the costs of default (<hi rend="italic">Z</hi>) are less than the principal plus interest of the loan contract (<hi rend="italic">LR</hi>) dishonest agents default. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p15.122">Formally, they default if <hi rend="italic">Z</hi> &lt; <hi rend="italic">LR</hi>
<hi rend="sup">6</hi>. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p15.122">These costs might be interpreted as "reputation" costs, which affect the capability of getting future loans and, indirectly, expected income (Jaffee and Russell op cit., p.654). </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.122">
<s n="s1.4;p16.122">It is also assumed that the lender can not distinguish <hi rend="italic">ex ante</hi> if the borrower is either honest of dishonest. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p16.122">Each agent's characteristics are only revealed <hi rend="italic">ex post</hi>. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p16.122">Furthermore, dishonest agents will attempt to act, <hi rend="italic">ex ante</hi>, as do the honest. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p16.122">This fact eliminates the possibility that the lender select only those honest agents and summarises the Imperfect Information assumption behind this framework. </s>
</p>
<p n="p17.122">
<s n="s1.5;p17.122">The loan demand function, aggregating both types of agents, is obtained from a utility maximisation problem under conventional characteristics of the utility function. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p17.122">It is assumed that preferences among agents are identical, which summarised the impossibility of differentiating <hi rend="italic">ex ante</hi> between honest and dishonest agents. </s>

<head>IV. Summary and Conclusions</head>
<p n="p87.122">
<s n="s1.1;p87.122">In this paper I have critically addressed the two principal frameworks which incorporate the Imperfect Information assumption to explain CR. While Jaffee and Russell (1976), the first model to introduce this hypothesis, emphasised Moral Hazard problems, Stiglitz and Weiss (1981) developed a model which relies on Adverse Selection considerations. </s>
</p>
<p n="p88.122">
<s n="s1.4;p88.122">Once these models were introduced, I answered the question as to how the imperfect information assumption explains CR in a way which synthesised both frameworks. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p88.122">As lenders are unable to distinguish from an <hi rend="italic">ex ante</hi> basis between the risk and behaviour of an individual borrower, a non-monotonic relationship exists between expected lender profits and the interest rates charged on loans. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p88.122">In this situation, the interest rate which maximises the expected lender profits may differ from the market-clear rate. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p88.122">If there is an excess demand for loans at the former interest rate, a situation of CR may exist. </s>
</p>
<p n="p89.122">
<s n="s1.4;p89.122">Nevertheless, the CR hypothesis as a consequence of imperfect information was criticised by different researchers, particularly from an empirical point of view. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p89.122">It has also been emphasised that the existence of contractual mechanisms such as collateralised loans may help to differentiate borrower characteristics in a way which avoids asymmetric information problems. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p89.122">I have argued that differences among borrowers are not unidimensional, and a limited set of contracts may not generate a symmetric information scenario, since some degree of uncertainty after collaterals is a probable outcome in credit market contracts. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p89.122">I also indicated that empirical CR measurements rely on important difficulties, since they involve <hi rend="italic">ex ante</hi> data, implying that supporting the hypothesis of CR or not might be sensitive to the way in which the data and the empirical tests are constructed. </s>
</p>
<p n="p90.122">
<s n="s1.2;p90.122">To conclude the analysis, two empirical tests on CR were introduced, adapting the Berger and Udell (1992) framework to the Argentine case. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p90.122">The evidence, although not conclusive, suggests the existence of CR among those less-collateralised borrowers in Argentina between 1996 and 2001. </s>
</p>
<p n="p91.122">
<s n="s1.1;p91.122">Further analysis on the evidence of CR in Argentina incorporating different data for testing CR via econometric techniques, the empirical study of the effects of collateral on Asymmetric Information problems, and the analysis of sticky prices (e.g. interest rate) as a consequence of imperfect information are interesting extensions of this paper. </s>
