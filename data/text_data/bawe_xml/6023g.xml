<div3>
<head rend="bold">2. Why does UHT processing usually give rise to a better quality? </head>
<p n="p36.45">
<s n="s1.1;p36.45">Because it is a high temperature short time process which usually results in less chemical damage to important nutrients and functional ingredients (2003, Lewis, class notes) hence the natural flavour is not compromised greatly. </s>
