<s n="s1.8;p7.30">Kodak was found over 125 years ago and is the largest US maker of photographic films and supplement products. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p7.30">Their business includes the development, manufacture, and marketing of traditional analogue and digital imaging products. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p7.30">It provides services and solutions for the entertainment and healthcare industry worldwide. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p7.30">However, as their company's vision suggests, their core attention remains focused in the consumer's products sector. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p7.30">Kodak, in the last 10 years, suffered from the transition within its operating environment. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p7.30">They saw a dramatic social shift from chemical- based film photography, the market they had dominated over a century, to modern digital technology. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p7.30">In their own research, they admitted digital technology would dominate the whole imaging industry in less than 20 years time. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p7.30">Their main income from analogue camera films, disposable cameras and other supply products are shrinking 3 times faster than predicted. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.30">
<s n="s1.11;p8.30">Kodak's response to that was to transform themselves into an imaging and digital business rather than the traditional film market leader. </s>
<s n="s2.11;p8.30">They have invested millions of dollars in digital technology and last year they sold over 22% of the digital cameras and other supplement products in US. They are also desperate to transform their service business into digital. </s>
<s n="s3.11;p8.30">Their printing kiosks are everywhere in the US and have started appearing in the UK. In addition, they have gone into the digital printing industry as it is recognised as a huge, continuous income. </s>
<s n="s4.11;p8.30">They also saw the potential in internet. </s>
<s n="s5.11;p8.30">They recently developed the world's first Wi-Fi camera, which allows users to send quality digital photos directly to the internet. </s>
<s n="s6.11;p8.30">Their desperate transformation has been acknowledged and is on the leading edge of the imaging business. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p8.30">However, it comes with a price as Kodak had a debt of around $ 3 billion. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p8.30">Layoff and closing down of traditional business assets show no sign of ceasing. </s>
<s n="s9.11;p8.30">Future remains uncertain as they have to compete with traditional electronic companies such as Sony while people tend to view their photos on the internet rather than buying their camera supplements like printers printing them off. </s>
<s n="s10.11;p8.30">It is also seen that the digital market will be saturated at some point. </s>
