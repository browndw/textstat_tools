<s n="s3.7;p23.26">If there were a support in the centre of two it would not deflect here. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p23.26">In setup one the load is central, this can be thought of as the reaction force of the central support in setup three. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p23.26">The 10N load should be thought of as working upwards, but this gives a deflection of 30.4mm. </s>

<s n="s3.4;p26.26">In practise the central support is not a knife-edge or 'true' point load as the computer simulation takes it to be. </s>
