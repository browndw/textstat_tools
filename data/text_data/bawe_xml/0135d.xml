<s n="s2.4;p1.19">Participant observation methods lend themselves to the study of 'deviant' groups of society and therefore through the study's very nature often result in more captivating and readable content than other research might. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p1.19">However, all research has flaws and limits. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p1.19">In this critique I will assess Taylor's research methods by considering how successful the book is in allowing for or avoiding the common limits of and problems associated with participant observation under the following headings, as identified by Layton-Henry<ref target="BAWE_0135d-ftnote.001"/>: </s>

<p n="p8.19">
<s n="s1.6;p8.19">My main criticism will focus on the deductive approach adopted by Taylor. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p8.19">Quite uncharacteristic to participant observation studies, this approach can be seen to have detrimental effects on Taylor's research strategies and results. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p8.19">Secondly, the processed and pre-interpreted nature of her results. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p8.19">Again, contrary to many other ethnographies, this could be seen to undermine the point of adopting participant observational methods. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p8.19">Both these points revolve around the problem in participant observation, that as the following definition highlights, scientific understanding is considered highly important and desirable in social research. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p8.19">In Taylor's attempts to produce scientific results, the impact of her study is arguably weakened. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.19">
<s n="s1.4;p9.19">Participant observation is perhaps most usefully defined as: "a process in which an investigator establishes a many-sided and relatively long-term relationship with a human association in its natural setting for the purpose of developing a scientific understanding of that association." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0135d-ftnote.002"/>
<s n="s2.4;p9.19">Taylor saw that the benefits of participant observation would allow her to provide a picture of women drug users through their own perspectives: "Much of the text allows the women to speak for themselves, describing from their point of view the lifestyles which have evolved around their use of illicit drugs." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0135d-ftnote.003"/>
<s n="s3.4;p9.19">Her other main reason is that "...no ethnographic study of female drug users alone has been undertaken anywhere".<ref target="BAWE_0135d-ftnote.004"/> This feminist perspective is clearly one which is essential to an understanding of drug users. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p9.19">However, due to its qualitative nature, participant observation has many methodological risks and limits. </s>

<p n="p10.19">
<s n="s1.13;p10.19">Firstly, access to the chosen group of study often proves difficult, and even after obtained, will affect the nature and success of one's study. </s>
<s n="s2.13;p10.19">Successful ethnographies, such as that of Whyte's 'Street Corner Society' can often depend on finding a sponsor or 'gate-keeper' who not only can introduce the observer to the subjects he/she wishes to study but is also seen in a favourable light by those subjects. </s>
<s n="s3.13;p10.19">Taylor was fortunate enough to find a contact, similar to that of Whyte's. </s>
<s n="s4.13;p10.19">Like Doc, the local drug-worker was known and respected by many of the women drug users in Taylor's study: "He was accepted and trusted by the women..." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0135d-ftnote.005"/>
<s n="s5.13;p10.19">Limitations of access also proved of little methodological concern due to the fact that being a woman worked in Taylor's favour: "The fact that I am a woman...made me more easily accepted and gave me more freedom to explore aspects of the women's lives which a man would have found difficult." </s>
<s n="s6.13;p10.19">This is supported by the detailed descriptions of the women as mothers; the role of partners and husbands in their lives and even issues of violence and rape which may not have been discovered by a male observer. </s>
<s n="s7.13;p10.19">However, it could also be argued that a man, by developing a long-term and close relationship with the women could have achieved similar results. </s>
<s n="s8.13;p10.19">Secondly, problems of language were minimalised by the fact that Taylor is a Glaswegian working in a Glaswegian community. </s>
<s n="s9.13;p10.19">However, as James Patrick also found in his study of a Glasgow gang, dialect and slang can differ enormously and must therefore be learned through observation: "Born and bred in Glasgow, I thought myself <hi rend="italic">au fait</hi> with the local dialect... - </s>
<s n="s10.13;p10.19">another serious mistake as it turned out." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0135d-ftnote.006"/>
<s n="s11.13;p10.19">Taylor therefore successfully adapted her own accent and dialect in order to be more readily accepted by the group. </s>
<s n="s12.13;p10.19">She employed an effective snow-balling technique in order to increase the number of women with whom she 'participated'. </s>
<s n="s13.13;p10.19">Taylor's access gaining methods, while to a certain extent out of her control, proved to be successful in terms of appropriateness to the aims of her study. </s>

<s n="s3.4;p11.19">This was essential as distrust on the part of the drug users would have resulted in an unreliable study. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p11.19">Apart from two incidents which Taylor was unaware of at the time<ref target="BAWE_0135d-ftnote.007"/>, she managed to conduct her research ethically and unlike Whyte refrained from becoming so involved with the group that 'participation' became illegal: "I had to learn that, in order to be accepted by the people in a district, you do not have to do everything just as they do it."<ref target="BAWE_0135d-ftnote.008"/> </s>

<s n="s1.11;p12.19">The task of balancing acceptance with observational detachment is a very difficult one. </s>
<s n="s2.11;p12.19">Clearly, Taylor was not captured by any member or section of the community. </s>
<s n="s3.11;p12.19">However, it could be argued that she was to a certain extent emotionally captured. </s>
<s n="s4.11;p12.19">Taylor uses Gold's four classifications of participant observation<ref target="BAWE_0135d-ftnote.009"/> and describes her role as "participant-as-observer"<ref target="BAWE_0135d-ftnote.010"/>. </s>
<s n="s5.11;p12.19">Yet as Whyte rightly points out: "Most teaching resources on participant observation fail to note that the researcher, like his informants, is a social animal".<ref target="BAWE_0135d-ftnote.011"/> Taylor clearly sympathises with the women in her study. </s>
<s n="s6.11;p12.19">Before even conducting her study she sought to disprove some of the derogatory stereotypes of women drug users, including their inability to be 'good' mothers. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p12.19">Through spending fifteen months with fifty different women, eight of whom became "key informants", these feelings of sympathy and even respect and fondness clearly strengthened. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p12.19">"In our society, the most fulfilling role for women is still regarded as that of motherhood...only the most articulate and confident of women are able successfully to challenge this interpretation. </s>
<s n="s9.11;p12.19">Other less fortunate, including the women of this study, labour under feelings of inadequacy, and hence of guilt." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0135d-ftnote.012"/>
<s n="s10.11;p12.19">Whilst it is very difficult to say if and to what extent these feelings could have affected the ethnography, possible areas of influence could have been in the 'agenda-setting' process of the study. </s>
<s n="s11.11;p12.19">Whether aware of it or not, the desire to show women drug users in a more favourable light than normal could have affected her decisions regarding whom to participate with and observe, and the questions she asked, (particularly in the 26 in-depth interviews). </s>

<s n="s3.6;p14.19">Whilst these divisions may prove useful to the reader in understanding more clearly the life of a female drug user, it must be recognised that the information in the book has been highly processed by Taylor. </s>

<s n="s5.6;p14.19">Other ethnographies such as Patrick's "A Glasgow Gang Observed", have adopted a more chronological structure which can help in allowing the subjects and incidents speak for themselves. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p14.19">However, no matter how data is presented it will always have been interpreted and processed by the researcher, highlighting the constant need for a researcher, particularly a participant observer to attempt to view his/her results objectively. </s>

<s n="s2.10;p15.19">As already argued, the interpretative stage of research may have been affected by this factor, but it could also be argued that this deductive approach may have led to the possibility of influence on the subjects of the study. </s>

<s n="s6.10;p15.19">By entering the study with perceived ideas of its direction, while often helpful in social research, Taylor may have affected the ethnography in a way she had not intended. </s>

<s n="s3.5;p17.19">A structure which was based on particular incidents in detail rather than themes or stages would have perhaps provided the reader with a more in-depth knowledge of the women she was observing. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p17.19">By providing description or a transcript of events or even 'non-events', (i.e. episodes where no major incident occurred but which could be considered typical of the woman drug user's everyday life), the reader would perhaps have benefited more from the qualitative style of research that participant observation studies often produce. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p17.19">The strength of participant observation lies in the detailed qualitative data which is obtained: "resulting data are typically qualitative rather than quantified scores readily amenable to standard statistical analysis"<ref target="BAWE_0135d-ftnote.020"/>. </s>

<s n="s1.8;p18.19">To conclude, a lot of the critical aspects to this analysis have been based on speculation. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p18.19">Firstly, the extent to which Taylor sought to prove her hypotheses from the beginning is unknown, perhaps even by her. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p18.19">Yet I have highlighted the associated risks of adopting such an approach in participant observation. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p18.19">Secondly, the presentation of Taylor's results has been criticised for being too processed and distant from the original, raw material. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p18.19">Again, to what extent the presented data differs from the original is also unknown. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p18.19">However, it seems that in choosing to present her results in such a fashion undermines the advantages of participant observation research. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p18.19">Aside from these two main criticisms, the research methods employed by Avril Taylor, especially in the collection of data, were appropriate and seemingly successful. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p18.19">While she may have interpreted quite a lot of the data herself, the use of the women's own perspectives and descriptions, written in their own style of dialect, allows the reader relatively large amounts of space in which to form his/her own opinion. </s>
</p>
<p n="p19.19">
<s n="s1.4;p19.19">Finally, it must be recognised that while Taylor may have been driven by a desire to prove her hypotheses, these hypotheses aimed to disprove many of the myths which can be seen to worsen the lives of the subjects of her study. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p19.19">She argues that the women in her study continued using illicit drugs and even were drawn to them from the beginning due to "the inability of society either to recognise or to cater for such women's needs." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0135d-ftnote.021"/>
<s n="s3.4;p19.19">The importance of research to be not only as objective and honest as possible, but also to be worthwhile and potentially beneficial must be remembered. </s>
