<s n="s4.4;p10.16">He suggests that ethnogenesis (the creation of 'new ethnic identities'<ref target="BAWE_6182f-ftnote.021"/>) was widespread in the early middle ages, arguing that there would have been obvious benefits for local people who imitated the high-status newcomers to their area who 'dominated post-Roman society'<ref target="BAWE_6182f-ftnote.022"/> Others have also observed that it would be irresponsible and closed minded to assume that, for example 'the wearing of Germanic brooches was exclusively confined to people of Germanic origin'<ref target="BAWE_6182f-ftnote.023"/> Perhaps the most we can assume in this case without further investigation is that trade contacts with Gaul were developed, or perhaps sustained from the past during the 6th-7th centuries. </s>
