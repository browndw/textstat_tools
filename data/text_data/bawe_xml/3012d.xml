<s n="s1.15;p1.61">The project started with the idea to work on Charles Dickens's <hi rend="italic">Oliver Twist</hi> (1838) since it is the subject of my dissertation for the English Masters. </s>
<s n="s2.15;p1.61">I first thought not to intervene in the text itself but in the 'before'or in the 'after'text. </s>
<s n="s3.15;p1.61">Nancy and the Artful Dodger have important roles in the development of the plot; however, little is said about them and their origins. </s>
<s n="s4.15;p1.61">Their actions are related to Oliver's story. </s>
<s n="s5.15;p1.61">Consequently, it might have been interesting to focus on the reasons why they became a prostitute for Nancy and a pickpocket for the Artful Dodger. </s>
<s n="s6.15;p1.61">An intervention of that kind would have been a prelude, the extension of the "text 'before' (...) the events it represents." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3012d-ftnote.001"/>
<s n="s7.15;p1.61">A postlude, the extension of the "text (...) 'after' the events it represents",<ref target="BAWE_3012d-ftnote.002"/> was not possible with the character of Nancy since she is killed by Sikes at the end of the story. </s>
<s n="s8.15;p1.61">However, a postlude concerning the Dodger's was a possibility. </s>
<s n="s9.15;p1.61">When he is taken to prison, the young pickpocket replied to the Bench's sentence "You'll pay for this, my fine fellows. </s>
<s n="s10.15;p1.61">I wouldn't be for you for something!" </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3012d-ftnote.003"/>
<s n="s11.15;p1.61">The postlude could have focused on the Dodger's imprisonment and could have included an escape for example and his 'return' and 'revenge'. </s>
<s n="s12.15;p1.61">All these ideas sounded very pleasant to explore but they were not of great interest for the subject of my dissertation since it is on Charles Dickens's treatment of London. </s>
<s n="s13.15;p1.61">As a consequence, the following project took another turn and I chose to work on the notion of time and to set <hi rend="italic">Oliver Twist</hi> in modern times. </s>
<s n="s14.15;p1.61">Hence, I would have to study Dickens's London as it was in the nineteenth-century and as it is in his novel together with today's London and try to combine them. </s>
<s n="s15.15;p1.61">Hence, the ideas of writing a prelude or a postlude were given up, however it might have been interesting to develop them and consequently I chose to mention them in the introduction of the commentary. </s>

<ref target="BAWE_3012d-ftnote.005"/>
<s n="s7.12;p2.61">In Dickens's novels, London became a character in itself; it was treated almost as an animate presence and thus became what Ackroyd calls "Dickens's London".<ref target="BAWE_3012d-ftnote.006"/> The aim of the project was to rewrite Dickens's London as it might have been if it had been written today and not in the nineteenth-century. </s>

<s n="s1.16;p3.61">My first work was to find some materials which could help me in the 'modernizing' process of the action and would give me a better idea of today's image of London or the city in general. </s>
<s n="s2.16;p3.61">In order to stick to the spirit of <hi rend="italic">Oliver Twist</hi>, the research had to focus on children or teenagers in poor or low areas. </s>
<s n="s3.16;p3.61">The study of their daily lives, activities and their language could be helpful tools in the <hi rend="italic">Oliver Twist</hi> rewriting. </s>
<s n="s4.16;p3.61">The first two sources turned to be useful for the composition but to a certain extent. </s>
<s n="s5.16;p3.61">To start, I watched <hi rend="italic">Sweet Sixteen</hi> (2002). </s>
<s n="s6.16;p3.61">Ken Loach's film presents the lives of today's teenagers in poor suburbs. </s>
<s n="s7.16;p3.61">Liam, the young hero, has many problems facing him every day, including small time crime such as stealing cars and vandalism. </s>
<s n="s8.16;p3.61">The story relates his descent into the criminal and drug underworld. </s>
<s n="s9.16;p3.61">As far as the rewriting was concerned, it could re-use some aspects of Ken Loach's film, concerning teenager's daily life such as eating fast-food or smoking but also their physical appearances - wearing cap and trainers for example, and their language - the use of slangy if not rude terms. </s>
<s n="s10.16;p3.61">I then turned to literature and to Irvine Welsh's <hi rend="italic">Trainspotting</hi> (1993). </s>
<s n="s11.16;p3.61">The novel is similar to Ken Loach's film in many respects. </s>
<s n="s12.16;p3.61">Similarly, it presents problems of drug, antisocial misdeeds. </s>
<s n="s13.16;p3.61">Nevertheless, both the film and the novel were inadequate for the main purpose of the rewriting since their action takes place in Scotland and the idea of the composition was to work on London. </s>
<s n="s14.16;p3.61">Moreover, the characters speak in Scottish and their language and vocabulary is probably very different from those of the Londoners. </s>
<s n="s15.16;p3.61">However, both sources eventually became key elements in the project, since they brought up the idea to work on language and accent. </s>
<s n="s16.16;p3.61">This aspect would be explored later in this commentary. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.61">
<s n="s1.28;p4.61">Materials which could be considered as helpful had to be set in London. </s>
<s n="s2.28;p4.61">Hence, I came to Zadie Smith's <hi rend="italic">White Teeth</hi> (2000). </s>
<s n="s3.28;p4.61">Smith deliberately rewrites Dickensian London from the perspective of immigrant communities, however her novel turned to be poor in descriptions of London and the focus is more on certain groups of people living in the capital. </s>
<s n="s4.28;p4.61">
<hi rend="italic">White Teeth</hi> well underlines that today's London is a multicultural city, a place full of people from different origins. </s>
<s n="s5.28;p4.61">The novel particularly focuses on Indian and Caribbean immigrants. </s>
<s n="s6.28;p4.61">Zadie Smith makes her character Clara speak English with Caribbean accent. </s>
<s n="s7.28;p4.61">This linguistic devise brings a lot to the novel which sounds more exotic but also realistic. </s>
<s n="s8.28;p4.61">I thus decided to integrate the multicultural landscape of London in my rewriting since it is indeed an actual contemporary aspect. </s>
<s n="s9.28;p4.61">However, Zadie Smith's novel turned to be not very helpful in terms of external descriptions of the city, of its atmosphere. </s>
<s n="s10.28;p4.61">In that respect, Sam Selvon's <hi rend="italic">The Lonely Londoners</hi> (1956) proved to be a wonderful asset for my composition. </s>
<s n="s11.28;p4.61">Sam Selvon is himself part of the great Caribbean immigration to Britain after World War Two. </s>
<s n="s12.28;p4.61">His novel deals with the Black British experience, telling the story of a group of Caribbean immigrants and their struggles in postwar London. </s>
<s n="s13.28;p4.61">Both the characters and the narrator's language follow Caribbean idioms and rhythms. </s>
<s n="s14.28;p4.61">In that respect, it is similar to Zadie Smith's <hi rend="italic">White Teeth</hi>, but Sam Nelvon's novel also focuses on London and its atmosphere. </s>
<s n="s15.28;p4.61">His treatment of London is reminiscent of Charles Dickens's. </s>
<s n="s16.28;p4.61">Sam Selvon writes "London is a place like that. </s>
<s n="s17.28;p4.61">It divide up in little worlds".<ref target="BAWE_3012d-ftnote.007"/> Dickens's London is also divided with its class division between the rich people such as Mr. Brownlow or the Maylies and the poor such as street children. </s>
<s n="s18.28;p4.61">Both the nineteenth and twentieth novelists pay close attention to the fog as "London particular".<ref target="BAWE_3012d-ftnote.008"/> If we consider the two following descriptions "one grim winter evening, when it had a kind of unrealness about London, with a fog sleeping over the city"<ref target="BAWE_3012d-ftnote.009"/> and "the ground was covered, nearly ankle-deep with filth and mire; a thick steam, perpetually rising from the reeking bodies of the cattle, and mingling with the fog, which seemed to rest upon the chimney-tops, hung heavily above"<ref target="BAWE_3012d-ftnote.010"/>, at first sight both quotes seem to be from the same pen, however more than a century separates them. </s>
<s n="s19.28;p4.61">Both Dickens and Selvon are careful in their treatment of London. </s>
<s n="s20.28;p4.61">The capital takes an important part in the general atmosphere of the plots. </s>
<s n="s21.28;p4.61">Hence, <hi rend="italic">The Lonely Londoners</hi> was the perfect source for the rewriting of <hi rend="italic">Oliver Twist</hi> in today's world. </s>
<s n="s22.28;p4.61">This novel gave me a clearer idea of the kind of rewriting my project was aiming at. </s>
<s n="s23.28;p4.61">After looking for helpful materials, the second stage was to tackle <hi rend="italic">Oliver Twist</hi> itself. </s>
<s n="s24.28;p4.61">As the aim of the composition was to rewrite Dickens's novel as it would have been today, the idea was to find a passage and rearrange it . </s>
<s n="s25.28;p4.61">The result had to sound as a contemporary work but it had to be done in keeping with the original <hi rend="italic">Oliver Twist</hi>'s spirit. </s>
<s n="s26.28;p4.61">The passage had to be selected carefully, the rewriting would be all the more relevant if the chosen extract presented several characteristics of Dickens's treatment of London. </s>
<s n="s27.28;p4.61">This is the reason why I finally decided to work on two different passages as the first that I had chosen did not eventually cover all the aspects I wished to tackle in the 'modernizing' process. </s>
<s n="s28.28;p4.61">The following lines of this essay focus and comment on the rewritings of the two chosen passages of <hi rend="italic">Oliver Twist</hi> and explains how they took shape, evolved and eventually became what they are. </s>

<s n="s1.14;p6.61">Once I had given different origins to the characters, I had to work on the language, the pronunciation and the vocabulary in order to make the 'rewritten' characters' words sound realist. </s>
<s n="s2.14;p6.61">With the help of the novels that I had read before and several internet websites<ref target="BAWE_3012d-ftnote.014"/>, I made up some kind of Caribbean and Scottish English dictionaries and I then translated almost verbatim what Dickens's characters say or I kept at least the same idea when it was too complex. </s>
<s n="s3.14;p6.61">As far as the Indian/Jew was concerned I did not give him any accent for two reasons. </s>
<s n="s4.14;p6.61">First, Zadie Smith makes her Hindu characters speak English with the classic accent and secondly it might have been excessive to present three different pronunciations in such a little passage. </s>
<s n="s5.14;p6.61">Hence, I had my Caribbean/Scottish version of <hi rend="italic">Oliver Twist</hi>. </s>
<s n="s6.14;p6.61">The multicultural aspect of today's London was recaptured, however, the 'Scottish dimension' was not really satisfying. </s>
<s n="s7.14;p6.61">In literature as well as in real life, it is not commonplace to hear of Scottish immigrants in London, especially when compared to Indian or Caribbean immigrants who actually form important communities in the capital. </s>
<s n="s8.14;p6.61">I thought that it had to be replaced by something more related to London and the idea of making Sikes a Cockney came. </s>

<s n="s10.14;p6.61">I thus started to study Cockney pronunciation and vocabulary<ref target="BAWE_3012d-ftnote.015"/> and I rewrote Sikes as a Cockney "droppin h's, g's and doin the glo'al stop"<ref target="BAWE_3012d-ftnote.016"/> or speaking in rhyming slang. </s>

<s n="s11.19;p8.61">As Soho is close to Regent Street, I could easily include the allusion to Hamleys toy shop. </s>
<s n="s12.19;p8.61">Moreover, today's pickpockets are more likely found in such tourist places. </s>
<s n="s13.19;p8.61">If the Artful Dodger and Master Charley Bates steal a silk handkerchief from Mr. Brownlow in Dickens, they would probably have stolen his mobile phone or digital camera if it was today. </s>

<s n="s1.15;p13.61">My first task was to find what the places mentioned by Dickens had become today in order to adapt the rewriting. </s>

<s n="s4.15;p13.61">Consequently, if I wanted to keep it in the rewriting, I had to refer to what distinguishes it today, its cupola. </s>
<s n="s5.15;p13.61">Concerning the turnpike at Islington, I was unable to find what the building is now, so I had to genearalize and I replaced it by the Tube station located in Islington - Highbury &amp; Islington. </s>
<s n="s6.15;p13.61">Similarly, I included Angel station and in terms of building, the workhouse became the job centre. </s>
<s n="s7.15;p13.61">Hence I modernized the boy's journey through London. </s>
<s n="s8.15;p13.61">Added to that, I introduced the anecdote of the terrorist events. </s>

<s n="s10.15;p13.61">People would rather take the Tube or the bus today. </s>
<s n="s11.15;p13.61">The mentioning of the potential terrorist attacks could justify the walk. </s>

<s n="s2.2;p31.61">When he got out Oxford Circus Tube station, he accidentally turned down a by-street which was not exactly in his way; but not discovering his mistake until he had got halfway down it, and knowing it must lead in the right direction, he did not think it worth while to turn back; and so marched on, as quickly as he could, with the cookery book mentioning the soy sauce under his arm. </s>
