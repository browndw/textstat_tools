<s n="s1.2;p1.21">The epoch of the Romantic Movement has been a topic of notable discussion, however it is generally postulated that it spanned the period between the mid-eighteenth and mid-nineteenth century, triumphing particularly in its later years. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p1.21">The Romantic Movement symbolised a momentous reaction against the degrading material and environmental changes stimulated by the centuries' industrial and agricultural revolutions, alongside a rejection of the rational dogmas of the Enlightenment. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.21">
<s n="s1.2;p2.21">The principal characteristics of the Romantic Movement included an overpowering yet troubled love of nature, sympathy and nostalgia for a golden past, and enthusiasm for a simple rural life. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p2.21">A combination of these elements provided the impetus in paving the way for modern environmentalism, because of their connection to the supreme force of Mother Nature and endeavours to protect her dominion. </s>

<p n="p3.21">
<s n="s1.4;p3.21">Although it is 'difficult to place the commencement of modern concerns about the environment to any specific date'<ref target="BAWE_0129e-ftnote.001"/>, <hi rend="italic">modern</hi> environmentalism evolved as a mass movement since Earth Day, in 1970. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p3.21">Although an understanding of environmental issues had been accumulating throughout the century, this national celebration underlined the fact that <hi rend="italic">modern</hi> society was growing <hi rend="italic">increasingly</hi> conscious of the threat posed by the profound environmental problems that stemmed from adverse developments in the economy. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p3.21">Such extensive awareness harped back to the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, where 'an impending global shortage of timber resources'<ref target="BAWE_0129e-ftnote.002"/> had given rise to schemes for forest protection, and preservation reserves were established owing to wildlife depletion at the hands of hunters. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p3.21">Modern environmentalism could be deemed part of a 'romantic resurgence'<ref target="BAWE_0129e-ftnote.003"/>, as it similarly endorsed the ideal that humans 'should behave with more peaceful and harmonious intentions towards nature'<ref target="BAWE_0129e-ftnote.004"/>, as opposed to the degrading and exploiting it. </s>

<s n="s2.5;p4.21">An early illustration of the extent to which the Romantic Movement paved the way for modern environmentalism can be seen in the studies of Gilbert White. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p4.21">His emphasis on the natural harmony of Selbourne eulogised the ideals of simplicity, the sublime landscape, unity with a palpable nature, and Pantheism, all of which were key concepts in the philosophy of the Romantic Movement. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p4.21">The latter was particularly central, as 'it seemed that to find God one must find 'unspoiled' nature, his creation'<ref target="BAWE_0129e-ftnote.006"/>, thus, because of the manifestation of God in nature, they saw it as a deity. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p4.21">White omitted citing the agricultural revolution in his book, <hi rend="italic">The Natural History of Selbourne</hi> (1789), despite the fact that it had irrevocably distorted the rustic simplicity of his life into an anachronism. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p6.21">Modern environmental theories were rooted in desires to return to the Golden Age of the pre-industrial era and capitulating oneself to nature, following the path laid down by the Romantic Movement. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p6.21">In their struggle to preserve the dynamics of nature, 'the ecocentric very much restates the ideas of the transcendentalists. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p7.21">Romantics expressed their deep disillusionment with the rise of deplorable industry and agricultural innovations, which vandalised nature. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p7.21">This was due to the adverse impact they had upon the landscape and wider environment; 'Romantics hated how industrialisation made previously beautiful places ugly." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0129e-ftnote.009"/>
<s n="s3.5;p7.21">Those involved in modern environmental movements similarly articulated their concerns about the destruction and gross exploitation of the landscape owing to modern industry and progressive agricultural technology. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p7.21">'Over the last 10,000 years human activities have brought about major changes in the ecosystems of the world." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0129e-ftnote.010"/>

<s n="s1.5;p8.21">A prime characteristic of modern environmentalism was an endeavour to conserve exhaustible sources of energy by conducting searches for safe, renewable sources. </s>

<s n="s3.5;p8.21">Modern environmentalists were 'romantic followers'<ref target="BAWE_0129e-ftnote.011"/>, as they shared the same lack of empathy towards industrialisation which 'created areas of concentrated pollution'<ref target="BAWE_0129e-ftnote.012"/>, regarding it as a profanity corrupting society. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p8.21">Industrial centres were viewed as transforming a <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> man into a sullied man encumbered by possessions and estranged from the dynamics of nature. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p9.21">It was the amalgamation of a myriad of environmental concerns that broadened the constituency of the modern environmental movement in the 1970s, underscoring a new phase in environmentalism. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p9.21">The plethora of modern environmental problems could be deemed cataclysmic, as they included the acute growth of modern metropolises, pollution, acid rain, extinction of various species of wildlife and entire natural ecosystems, global warming and ozone depletion, mineral depletion, deforestation, and the exhaustion of natural resources. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p9.21">The 'pioneers of modern environmentalism'<ref target="BAWE_0129e-ftnote.013"/> sought to limit, if not rectify, these problems by establishing numerous protective schemes, for example to conserve forests by placing strict controls upon the cutting of trees. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p10.21">However, some initial government policies to combat deforestation were autocratic and had detrimental effects, particularly for Native American Indians who were displaced from their forest dwellings. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p10.21">This was also a consequence of the revolutionary establishment of wildlife sanctuaries, which required the indigenous forest communities to relocate. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p10.21">The first of these special reserves, Yellowstone National Park in America, was founded for recreational purposes in 1872. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p10.21">It predominantly promoted 'escapism, as well as the more positive romantic desire for spiritual regeneration'<ref target="BAWE_0129e-ftnote.014"/> for the urban middle-class. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p10.21">The Romantic Movement had paved the way for this sense of a <hi rend="italic">retreat</hi> back to the solace of nature, as it presented an opportunity for those who had become estranged from nature to withdraw back into it, away from the distortions and corruptions of heavy industry, consumerism, and city life. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p10.21">However, the dislocation of the Natives, in order to establish National Parks, went against ideals of the Romantic Movement, which exalted the 'noble savage'<ref target="BAWE_0129e-ftnote.015"/> and the way they lived in harmony with nature. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p12.21">David Pepper proposes that 'within the environmental movement there is a host of ideologies and cross-currents'<ref target="BAWE_0129e-ftnote.016"/>, and furthermore, that some factions altered the path of their campaigning in synonymy with contemporary environmental concerns. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p12.21">For instance, in 1972, the Club of Rome sponsored <hi rend="italic"> The Limits of Growth</hi>, which instigated the debate over the potential consequences of the continued exhaustion of energy supplies, even though their own predictions proved to be unsubstantiated. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p12.21">Consequently, following the oil crisis of 1973, there arose a search for alternative energy sources. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p12.21">However, by the early 1980s emphasis had turned to the issue of pollution caused by those alternative mineral resources. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p14.21">Arcadian sensibilities, accentuating the idea of an <hi rend="italic">ordered</hi> nature, had emerged prior to the Romantic Movement, yet were imbued with many of the same sentiments For example, both celebrated the primitive and pastoral harmony with nature that had been experienced in the unspoiled period of the Golden Age, notably expressed by French Enlightenment philosophe, and first of the Romantics, Jean-Jacques Rousseau. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p14.21">However, Arcadianism did not share the same revolutionary and turbulent spirit as the Romantic Movement, which rejoiced in the disordered wilderness and irrational side of nature. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p14.21">Nevertheless, Arcadian critiques also played a role in paving the way for modern environmentalism to a certain extent, highlighted by Donald Worster in <hi rend="italic">Nature's Economy: A History of Ecological Ideas</hi> (1985), because of its emphasis on co-existence with nature as opposed to the self-appointed, egotistical superiority and domination by humans. </s>

<p n="p15.21">
<s n="s1.6;p15.21">The work of Charles Darwin, from the 1830s, did not elaborate upon this aspect of co-existence. </s>

<s n="s3.6;p15.21">It was not until the later nineteenth century that he reverted his ideals back to the concept of harmony and oneness with nature, reminiscing about Arcadian and Romantic notions of respect for Mother Nature. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p15.21">However, Darwin's theories had already been used in a perverse manner to justify the violence of science and the exploitation of nature for the common good of <hi rend="italic">superior</hi> humanity. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p15.21">Romantics were highly critical of such superficial forms of modern science and the violence it often entailed, for example in animal and plant research where it was employed in order to construct, to some degree superfluous, systems of classification. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p15.21">Thus the framework of modern environmentalism can be seen as originating in the doctrines that renounced the rigorous manipulation of nature by modern science, which burgeoned in the Romantic Movement. </s>

<s n="s2.3;p16.21">The latter, and his 'modern limits to growth argument'<ref target="BAWE_0129e-ftnote.020"/>, can be seen as pre-empting debates about the extent of progression in modern society, and the extent to which the environment could cater for the surging population of humanity. </s>
