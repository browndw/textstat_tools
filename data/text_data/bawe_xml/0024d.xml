<s n="s3.10;p1.43">The use of theatrical techniques by the differing cultures to illustrate social and political values renders the plays of this period to have built into their fabric, an overriding reflection of social consciousness and political ideas. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p1.43">This reflection appears to be the very essence of Restoration Drama. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p1.43">The difficulty lies in identifying the genre of the plays - more particularly, the Restoration Comedies. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p1.43">It has been rightly noted that several sorts of comedy co-existed during the period. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p1.43">They can be - rather clumsily - categorized as Jonsonian, Intrigue, Dryden, Manners, Farce and Sentiment. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p1.43">This presents a problem when we come to apply them to the plays however; for when reading Restoration Comedy, one gets a sense that it consists of many of the categories combined together. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p1.43">Moreover, the plays are categorized according only to opinion - '<hi rend="italic">The Plain Dealer'</hi>, for example, '...is a comedy of manners according to most critics, a satire or a wit comedy according to others. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p3.43">For this essay I have chosen two plays, each using a different approach. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p3.43">The satiric in William Wycherley's '<hi rend="italic">The Plain Dealer</hi>' and the shift toward the sentimental twenty years later in Colley Cibber's '<hi rend="italic">Love's Last Shift</hi>'. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p3.43">Firstly however, I am going to discuss each of the styles and establish the clear difference between them before exploring how each approach affects the components of the different plays. </s>

<p n="p4.43">
<s n="s1.5;p4.43">The two approaches give Restoration Comedy an additional purpose than simply entertaining the audience. </s>

<s n="s4.5;p4.43">The sentimental approach - more aptly termed as an exemplary form of comedy, hoped to fulfil a contrasting role to the satirical approach I think. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p4.43">I will now highlight the main differences to be discussed. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.43">
<s n="s1.1;p5.43">One of the differences in the approach to playwriting is the effect the social background had on the satirical and the sentimental style. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.43">
<s n="s1.8;p6.43">Another difference lies in characterisation. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p6.43">Restoration Comedy appears to have relied upon two particular components to make it successful. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p6.43">The first is its mission to recommend virtue and discountenance vice, be it by illustrating honestly a society filled with creatures of appetite, exemplified in '<hi rend="italic">The Plain Dealer</hi>', or, in the case of '<hi rend="italic">Love's Last Shift</hi>', presenting us with one such character converted to love with unlikely suddenness. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p6.43">The play's success as either a corrective or an exemplary comedy is drawn from the wittily dealt with moral issues within the plot and the responses of the characters towards them. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p6.43">This component gives Restoration Comedy its didactic quality. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p6.43">Its effectiveness depends on the play's success in reflecting the characters and manners of the period - approached differently in satiric and sentimental writing. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p6.43">This is the second component. '... </s>
<s n="s8.8;p6.43">There is a distinction between comedy regarded as the vehicle of corrective satire and comedy conceived as an almost exemplary display of social grace and witty refinement.'<ref target="BAWE_0024d-ftnote.004"/> </s>

<s n="s1.3;p7.43">Stemming from the differences in character between the approaches a contrast in the humour of the plays. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p7.43">A satirical play depends a great deal on wit and sarcasm in order to expose human vice. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p7.43">Although exemplary or sentimental comedy makes use of satirical wit in a similar way, (particularly in the first four acts of '<hi rend="italic">Love's Last Shift</hi>'), " Four Acts for you coarse Palates were design'd,'<ref target="BAWE_0024d-ftnote.005"/> it is identified through the use of a more genteel and pleasant humour. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p15.43">Although the play is based loosely on '<hi rend="italic">Le Misanthrope</hi>', the French style, affected by a vastly contrasting social consciousness to the English, is comparable to the '<hi rend="italic">The Plain Dealer</hi>' in a similar way to the sentimental approach. </s>

</p>
<p n="p22.43">

<s n="s2.2;p22.43">Wycherley's play was written for an audience perfectly primed to be pleased and instructed by theatre which held a glass to a society in need of satiric correction. </s>
</p>
<p n="p23.43">
<s n="s1.7;p23.43">It is confusing to establish if there is a clear shift in the dominant concept of humour, or rather - when satirical humour ended and sentimental began. </s>
