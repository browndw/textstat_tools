<head rend="bold">3. The Systems Response</head>
<p n="p1.31">
<s n="s1.3;p1.31">In the first phase of this report, I detailed the requirements of the client, FilmReel UK Ltd, of Reading, for the implementation of a World Wide Web (WWW) precence in the form of an E-Commerce website, allow the website to conduct business, and trade electronically, over the itnernet. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p1.31">This second phase of the report (Appendix "Z") will examine how I have implemented the proposed ideas and delivered on the business requirements established to produce a working first version of the FilmReel.com website. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p1.31">Version 1.0 of the website can be found on the CD-ROM attached to this doucment. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.31">
<s n="s1.5;p2.31">Leading up to the completion of Version 1 were a number of practical tasks, involving the creation of a new website structure using the chosen web development environment, Macromedia Dreamweaver. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p2.31">The framework for the website was fleshed out by desigining a site, local web directory, and testing server. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p2.31">The databases designed in the earlier phase of the report were created in Microsoft Access and placed within the framework of the web site hierarchy. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p2.31">Appropriate artwork was created from original designs using Adobe Photoshop. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p2.31">From this structure I developed the pages and structure over a period of several weeks, testing during and after development, with reference to the stakeholder requirements, to produce a final first-version presented herein. </s>
</p>
<div2>
<head>3.1 Website Architecture</head>
<p n="p3.31">
<s n="s1.1;p3.31">In this section of the Phase B report I will attempt to provide the reader with an overview of the concept and structure I had in mind when designing the website, with reference to the targeted users of the website, and how these designs were implemented in the finished version 1. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.31">
<s n="s1.1;p4.31">The images below show the structure of the website by examining the web folder as a hierarchy, from the root folder (inetpub\wwwroot in Internet Information Services web server). </s>

<p n="p5.31">
<s n="s1.4;p5.31">Figure A. shows the entire website structure from the root level. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p5.31">The web pages (Active Server Pages) are held in the root here, indicated with the .asp file extension. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p5.31">Other resources used by the web application are structured into sub-folders of this root folder. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p5.31">The aspnet_client and connections folders are used by Internet Information Services webserver to manage SQL (database) calls to produce the web pages from product and customer information held in the databases stored in the database sub-folder. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.31">
<s n="s1.2;p6.31">Figure B. shows the Database folder, containing the three databases powering the website, one to hold the product catalogue, one to hold user information, and another to hold customer comments and queries direct to us via the Contact Us section of the website. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p6.31">The Product images folder holds photos of the products in the catalogue to be displayed with the information about each product. </s>
