<quote lang="English">'... Hector sent his voice ringing out to the whole Trojan army: "On with you, horse-taming Trojans! Smash the Greek wall and fire the ships!" So he spoke, and there was no Trojan ear that did not catch his stirring call. Massing together, they charged at the wall and began to scale the parapet with sharp spears in their hands. But Hector seized and brought a rock that was lying in front of the gate. Broad at the base and coming to a point, it would have taxed the strength of the two best men in any town of the present generation to lever it up from the ground onto a waggon. But Hector handled it effortlessly on his own. Zeus, son of sickle-wielding Cronus, had made it light for him. As a shepherd easily picks up a ram's fleece in one hand, carries it off and scarcely feels the weight, so Hector lifted up the rock and brought it towards the planking that made up the high, strong, well-fitted double gates, which were held on the inside by two beams sliding in from either gate-post, locked by a single bolt. Hector went right up to them and bracing himself, legs wide apart for maximum power, hurled the rock, hit the doors full in the middle and smashed it out of its pivots on either side. The force of the throw propelled the rock through, and there was a great roar from the gate as the planks were smashed to splinters by the impact of the stone and the bars gave way. In leapt glorious Hector, face dark as nightfall. He held two spears in his hands and the bronze of his body-armour gleamed with a baleful light. None but a god could have met and held him as he sprang through that gate. And now, with fire flashing from his eyes, he wheeled round to the crowd behind him and called on the Trojans to cross the wall. His men responded to his summons. Some swarmed over the wall; others poured in through the gates itself. The panic-stricken Greeks fled back to their hollow ships, and all hell broke loose.' (Iliad, XII, 439-471)</quote>

<s n="s2.5;p4.24">As well as it being a means for Hector to give his men inspiration in fighting, Homer also uses it as a means to show Hector in a strong and heroic light, as he describes the effortlessness with which Hector first lifts, and then uses, the rock. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p4.24">This allows the audience and the reader to understand the truly heroic figure as someone who has an "extreme level of male energy, a level which the lesser men of later times can never reach"<ref target="BAWE_6201e-ftnote.004"/>, which also gives an insight into the time that Homer looks back to in his poetry. </s>

<s n="s3.3;p6.24">The vivid descriptions of Hector actually throwing the rock with such power that it "hit the door full in the middle and smashed it out of its pivots on either side"<ref target="BAWE_6201e-ftnote.008"/> are told in such a way as to show the carnage that war brings, but also, once again, to echo a time of great heroes and great deeds. </s>

</note>
<p n="p7.24">
<s n="s1.6;p7.24">These deeds are told in such a way as to be familiar to the audience to whom Homer was performing his poetry. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p7.24">This is shown here especially by the description of how Hector handles the rock "as a shepherd easily picks up a ram's fleece...and scarcely feels the weight, so Hector lifted up the rock"<ref target="BAWE_6201e-ftnote.009"/>, which shows how the concept of a heroic warrior culture such as the 'Iliad' was very much foreign to Homer's audience, but other cultures, such as agricultural and farming cultures were absolutely normal to his audience. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p7.24">Homer therefore uses similes that would allow him to explain one society to another, as is shown here. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p7.24">He also uses a variety of epithets, not only in this passage, but also throughout the poem, such as referring to the Trojans as "horse-taming Trojans" frequently, as this, like the description of a shepherd picking up a sheep's fleece to describe the ease with which Hector picks up the rock, is another example of how Homer is able to show a heroic society by using agricultural similes in order to make the heroic society of the 'Iliad' more understandable to his audience by using language familiar to them. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p7.24">The description of the Trojans is also interesting, however, because it brings about a small degree of foreshadowing about how this war will end, with the Greeks sacking Troy thanks to the plan of entering the city in the wooden horse. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p7.24">It also foreshadows the end of the poem, as the final line of the poem is "Such were the funeral rites of horse-taming Hector"<ref target="BAWE_6201e-ftnote.010"/> and the Trojans mourn for the loss of their greatest warrior. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p8.24">The end of the passage is also the end of Book 12 of the 'Iliad'. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p8.24">It ends with Hector calling the Trojans to cross into the Greek camp, which they do and with "the panic-stricken Greeks [fleeing] back to their hollow ships [as] all hell broke loose." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_6201e-ftnote.011"/>
<s n="s3.4;p8.24">Such an ending to the book is interesting, because it appears to be a very abrupt ending, as it has been leading up to what looks to be a huge, violent battle. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p8.24">Once again, by leaving the potentially huge battle until the next book, Homer is foreshadowing the bloodshed that is to come, rather than showing it right at the end of this extremely intense passage of action after the Greek gate was broken, giving the audience a sense of great anticipation of what is to come later in the poem. </s>

<s n="s3.7;p11.24">Being a hero, he may die young, killed by another great hero, so it is important that he proves himself in his short life by killing other heroes, as heroes are men who "affirm their greatness by the brilliance...with which they kill"<ref target="BAWE_6201e-ftnote.014"/> as well as the heroes whom they kill, so they are judged on results in battle. </s>
