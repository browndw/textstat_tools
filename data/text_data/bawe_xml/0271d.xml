<s n="s1.9;p4.11">Similarly, social loafing explains why individuals become less motivated working in groups. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p4.11">It is a phenomenon which predicts how a weak social identity decreases individual performance and diminishes group productivity. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p4.11">However, unlike social facilitation, there are factors preventing this phenomenon from occurring. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p4.11">One of them is the level of group cohesiveness, which is "defined as the complex of forces giving rise to the perceptions by members of a group identity". </s>
<s n="s5.9;p4.11">According to Karau &amp; Williams' meta-analysis study, the level of motivation is not as affected in highly cohesive groups, because individuals believe that their group or their task holds a great importance<ref target="BAWE_0271d-ftnote.008"/>. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p4.11">The surrounding social culture is another critical manipulate on individual performance. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p4.11">When people are encouraged to work for personal success in highly individualistic cultures like the United States, social loafing is likely to occur. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p4.11">The notion of working for self benefit encourages people to become more motivated, and thus, enhances individual performance. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p4.11">Social loafing is, however, unlikely to occur in highly collectivistic cultures such as Japan, as people are inspired by group accomplishments over personal achievements. </s>

<s n="s3.4;p5.11">One of the influences in conformity is known as the normative social influence, which is when the minority conforms in order to prevent the group's potential rejection and punishment. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p5.11">Alternatively, the informational social influence is when the minority conforms, based on the trust of group opinion.<ref target="BAWE_0271d-ftnote.010"/> The major difference between these two is that the normative influence can pressure people to conform despite conflicting private attitudes and contradictory group norms. </s>

<s n="s5.7;p6.11">Despite watching the learner tortured in pain, most of the teachers continued to apply higher levels of shock to the learner until the maximum level has been reached. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p6.11">The teachers' compliancy to set protocols reveals how the pressure of conformity overrides the ethical judgment to stop inflicting pain on another person. </s>
