<s n="s1.2;p1.64">With the 2008 Beijing Olympics in the making, it adds to the global recognition that China is fast emerging and will potentially emerge as the next global power as well as a regional powerhouse in South East Asia. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p1.64">To account for how and when it emerged in the international limelight is as controversial as the debate on the implications of its rise. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.64">
<s n="s1.1;p2.64">The essay rests on a fundamental acknowledgement of China's rise as an on-going dynamic process in an evolving global context and the crux of the essay lies more importantly with the implications of its rise for the major status quo powers, set within the parameters of a global and regional Asia-Pacific context. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.64">
<s n="s1.5;p3.64">In essence, there are many accompanying questions that fuel the debate between "the China Threat" and the "Peaceful rise of China"; will China be a satisfied mature power or an insecure defensive nouveau riche power? </s>

<s n="s3.5;p3.64">Will Beijing seek regional hegemony or peaceful coexistence with its neighbours?<ref target="BAWE_0137j-ftnote.001"/> Such will be the major issues that the essay will focus on and attempt to address. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p3.64">With such thematic issues in mind, the essay will also flow systematically from the initial definitional to the argumentative and finally to the conclusive section all directed towards the analysis of the implications of China's possession and use of power. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p3.64">In relation, the entire essay is also metaphorically stringed up by a central theme of the "Great Wall" of China which accompanies and reinforces the current debate on China's strengths and weaknesses seen from outside and within, whether such metaphorical and real walls of fortresses translates to aggressive threat or defensive gestures. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p6.64">As the "China Threat" theory became a common currency, the term "Peaceful Rise" was invented as an important counterweight to the prevalent "China Threat" or "China Collapse" theories in the West. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p6.64">One of its central tenets is that China will never seek hegemony and asserting it was a skilful diplomatic move to assure others concerned about China's growing economic and military strength. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p6.64">Yet ironically, the term has also played into the hands of China's critics, some of the more strident of whom "shudder at the mere mention of the word 'rise' in connection with China"<ref target="BAWE_0137j-ftnote.003"/> for it draws parallels with the rise of Germany and Japan. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p19.64">Drawn from the Chinese Defense White Paper of July 1998, there are five concepts which underlay their foreign policy and comprises a "new concept of security" for China: (1) salience of 'comprehensive security' as opposed to 'military security' (2) security as a 'mutual' rather than 'zero-sum' dynamic (3) emphasis on cooperation and dialogue (4) importance of confidence building measures (5) gradual acceptance of the concept of 'transparency'. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p60.64">Since this essay establishes that China should be received with caution but not alarm, the most appropriate line of action will be "engagement" rather than "containment" which will sustain a "Peaceful re-emergence of China" over time. </s>

</p>
<p n="p62.64">
<s n="s1.4;p62.64">The essay started on the premise that its strength has been inaccurately portrayed if we define power in purely economic and military terms and if we include more extensive assessment criterions, we would be aware of China's internal insecurities, domestic concerns and defensive posture which may not even translate to real strength. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p62.64">Even with its supposed strength, this would not translate into a contemporary threat if we are aware of its peaceful and defensive disposition. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p62.64">In addition, if China projects its power with the global consequences in mind, it is very much tied down by 'world governance' - multilateral security and economic institutions to refine and define China's actions. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p62.64">With all these open possibilities in an evolving era, we should not outrightly equate strength to threat. </s>
</p>
<p n="p63.64">
<s n="s1.3;p63.64">Above all, it must be stressed that neither hypothesis, be it the "China Threat" or "Peaceful re-emergence of China" is substantial to account for such a complex phenomenon with its far ranging impact on so many actors and regions over time. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p63.64">China is a big enough power that its choice is not merely between obeying the world's rules or flouting them, hence upholding peace or posing threat respectively. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p63.64">Though, it has been argued that China is more inclined to peace than threat. </s>
</p>
<p n="p64.64">
<s n="s1.5;p64.64">Even then, the applicability of this "peaceful re-emergence" hypothesis over time is conditional. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p64.64">It will depend on how China defines and implements its foreign and domestic policies, how others relate and respond to China and how China will reciprocate accordingly. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p64.64">As such, it calls for shared responsibility to shoulder a potential "China Threat"; China needs to be more persuasive in its actions than just rhetoric and there is a need for a western policy that reflects an understanding of and sensitivity to the factors that motivate Chinese policies and responses. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p64.64">With mutual understanding between China and the world, the "China Threat" may not snowball into a real threat and remains purely a myth even if it is a misguided one. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p64.64">In all, let us embrace the awakened dragon with optimism accompanied by caution and vigilance. </s>
