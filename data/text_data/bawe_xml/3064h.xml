<p n="p7.37">
<s n="s1.2;p7.37">Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are a simple, clear design in which a variable is manipulated and change observed (Abbott and Sapsford, 1997). </s>

<p n="p12.37">
<s n="s1.5;p12.37">To estimate how large a sample will be required, a statistician will be consulted to perform a power analysis (Buckeldee and McMahon, 1994). </s>
<s n="s2.5;p12.37">This will be done to ensure that an adequate number of participants will be included in the study to test the hypotheses and to have the power to determine whether the interventions made a difference in the study outcomes (Depoy and Gitlin, 1998). </s>
<s n="s3.5;p12.37">There are a number of considerations in determining a sample size; the data analytical procedures that will be used, statistical levels of significance, the strength of difference in sample values expected, and statistical power (an 80 % power level is considered the minimum level of acceptability from the power analysis) (Depoy and Gitlin, 1998). </s>
<s n="s4.5;p12.37">These are all to be considered before a sample size is chosen. </s>

<p n="p13.37">

<p n="p15.37">
<s n="s1.3;p15.37">Participants will be asked to attend a hand clinic once every 2 weeks for 20 weeks to see an occupational therapist (OT) who will give them exercises to do in their own time, to help with the symptoms of their RA. For the treatment group who will also be receiving splinting treatment, the OT will fabricate an appropriate splint for the participant and educate them on how to use it. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p15.37">The aims of the sessions will be for the OT to ensure the participants are undertaking their exercise regime, or exercise and splinting regime, and undertaking it correctly, and also for the participants to express any concerns or questions that may arise over the 20 week period. </s>

<p n="p37.37">
<s n="s1.4;p37.37">A limitation of the before-and-after study design is that it measures total change, so it cannot be determined whether independent or extraneous variables are responsible for producing the change in the dependent variable (Kumar, 1996). </s>

<s n="s3.4;p37.37">The nature of RA may also effect the results as there are various stages of RA (early, moderate, severe, terminal) and strength may vary depending on times of the day when joint stiffness is decreased (Turner, Foster and Johnson, 2002). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p37.37">It may therefore, depend on the time of day the AHFT is carried out as to what results are obtained, as well as the stage of RA each participant has. </s>
