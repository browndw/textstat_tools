<s n="s1.17;p1.10">The marketing catch phrase a picture is worth a thousand words, while in some cases true, presents a paradox related to human behaviour; while products and services may be influential, <hi rend="italic">no</hi> picture truly sums up all possible perceptions (Snehota, 2004). </s>
<s n="s2.17;p1.10">The study of <hi rend="italic">consumer behaviour</hi> thus follows a growing awareness to <hi rend="italic">acquire</hi> and <hi rend="italic">organize</hi> information on behavioural processes involved in purchasing, using, and disposing of products, services, ideas or experiences (Moutinho, 1987; Solomon <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 1999; Goeldner <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s3.17;p1.10">, 2000). </s>
<s n="s4.17;p1.10">Authors agree that improved understanding of consumers' internal, psychological, processes is important for companies to meet the needs of desired target markets (Goeldner <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s5.17;p1.10">, 2000; Hudson <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s6.17;p1.10">, 2000; Middleton <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s7.17;p1.10">, 2001, Usunier <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 2005). </s>
<s n="s8.17;p1.10">Even so the tourism industry presents a unique challenge owing to the intangibility of services, coupled with extensive periods of time travellers invest in planning and purchasing an <hi rend="italic">experience</hi>; an area which in the past has been inadequately viewed as simplistic (Moutinho, 1987; Hudson <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s9.17;p1.10">, 2000). </s>
<s n="s10.17;p1.10">As travellers become more sophisticated the question arises as to why particular groups of travellers seek a certain service X within destination Y (Goeldner <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s11.17;p1.10">, 2000; Moutinho, 1987). </s>
<s n="s12.17;p1.10">Consequently, tourism practitioners need to effectively divide the vacation market into subgroups or <hi rend="italic">segments</hi> according to the destination images held by non-residents; facilitating cost-effective marketing to current and future travellers (Middleton <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 2001; Leisen, 2001; Solomon <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 1999). </s>
<s n="s13.17;p1.10">Various authors are in agreement that in formulating such strategies, <hi rend="italic">consumer behaviour models</hi> are useful tools in <hi rend="italic">simplifying</hi> abstract relationships and links between numerous internal and external variables which affect behaviour (Chisnall, 1995; Cooper <hi rend="italic">et</hi> al., 1998, Moutinho, 1987; Swarbrooke <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s14.17;p1.10">, 1999). </s>
<s n="s15.17;p1.10">Models also provide <hi rend="italic">micro-level</hi> insights into travellers' thoughts, choices, and events occurring during actual trips (Woodside <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s16.17;p1.10">, 2001). </s>
<s n="s17.17;p1.10">This essay begins with an introduction to <hi rend="italic">Shakespeare's Globe Theatre</hi> and evaluates the benefits of <hi rend="italic">Woodside &amp; King's</hi> consumer behaviour model in understanding future student travellers' behaviour. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.10">
<s n="s1.7;p2.10">Founded by American actor/director Sam Wanamaker, the Globe Theatre offers a unique global and local resource committed to the exploration of Shakespeare's work, and the playhouse for which he wrote, by way of education and performance. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p2.10">The Globe Theatre is located a short distance from Southwark Bridge in London and is open from May to September. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p2.10">Accessible from both the <hi rend="italic">Visit-London</hi> (<seg type="URL" n="http://www.visitlondon.com"/>) and, the Globe's interactive website (<seg type="URL" n="http://www.shakespeares-globe.org"/>), the reconstruction of the 1599 open - air playhouse, exposes visitors to the same ambience as that of 400 years ago. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p2.10">Visitors may attend several performances by booking gallery seating or standing as <hi rend="italic">groundlings</hi> in the yard. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p2.10">Moreover, guests benefit from formal and informal dining facilities, on - site and online shopping, and exhibition halls of various Shakespearean artefacts. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p2.10">Yet one of the more intriguing services the Globe Theatre offers is a vast selection of educative programs, taught jointly with King's College London, targeting students of all ages and nations. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p2.10">It would thus be reasonable to assume that this group of travellers forms a significant segment of the Globe Theatre's visitors; which may consequently be segmented by purpose of travel; namely university students seeking educative events in the performing arts and Shakespearean heritage. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.10">
<s n="s1.38;p3.10">In the past decades, progressive changes in education and tourism have seen a convergence of these industries into <hi rend="italic">educational</hi> tourism, an area recognized from both an economical and social perspective (Ritchie <hi rend="italic"> et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s2.38;p3.10">, 2003). </s>
<s n="s3.38;p3.10">Even so, <hi rend="italic">travelling to learn</hi> is not a new concept, dating back to when Greek and Roman elites travelled to increase their understanding of the world (Ritchie <hi rend="italic"> et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s4.38;p3.10">, 2003; Swarbrooke <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s5.38;p3.10">, 1999). </s>
<s n="s6.38;p3.10">Today, education and learning are important and recognised components of travel, and to this extent it can be argued all manner of tourism may be educational; thus, research in this broad and complex area remains minimal (Smith <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 1997 cited in Ritchie <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s7.38;p3.10">, 2003). </s>
<s n="s8.38;p3.10">Still smaller, more identifiable, market segments exist within this broad tourism field. </s>
<s n="s9.38;p3.10">University students are one such segment, yet a chronological definition has been a discussion topic owing to changing demographics; the traditionally accepted age limit of 15 - 25 has been replaced by 18 - 30 (Carr, 2003; Seekings, 1998). </s>
<s n="s10.38;p3.10">This definition has only increased the already considerable number of student travellers in the last decade, which some researchers predict will 'quadruple to 100 million by 2025' (Carr, 2003; Mintel, 2005; Smith <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s11.38;p3.10">, 1997, p. 64). </s>
<s n="s12.38;p3.10">The UK has witnessed increasing numbers of not just the general population entering university, but continues to be one of Europe's most successful educational destinations; owing to the global importance of the English language (Carr, 2003; Smith <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s13.38;p3.10">, 1997). </s>
<s n="s14.38;p3.10">Moreover, a strong correlation is evident between educational visits to-and-within the UK, and theatre attendance in such cities as London; owing to increased search for learning and enlightenment (Gilbert <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s15.38;p3.10">, 1998). </s>
<s n="s16.38;p3.10">In fact, the majority of visited attractions are located in the centre and south bank of London (Virdee <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s17.38;p3.10">, 2003). </s>
<s n="s18.38;p3.10">Even more intriguing is the steadily increasing numbers of students entering higher educations to study history and other related degrees; namely Heritage Studies (English Heritage, 2003). </s>
<s n="s19.38;p3.10">Despite the considerable size and growth of university students, little research has been conducted to understand this segment's needs, desires, and behaviour (Carr, 2003). </s>
<s n="s20.38;p3.10">However, what is known is this segment displays a range of similar educational motives as other tourists travelling to learn; subsequently illustrated in the following page (Ritchie <hi rend="italic"> et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s21.38;p3.10">, 2003). </s>
<s n="s22.38;p3.10">Furthermore, studies of this segment have covered the <hi rend="italic">general</hi> student population relative to specific issues including hedonistic behaviour; thus, to an extent distorting the image of university student holidays (Carr, 2003). </s>
<s n="s23.38;p3.10">One such widely held misconception relates to expenditure, the belief being that students and younger tourists spend less than other market segments (Carr, 2003; Seekings, 1998; Smith <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s24.38;p3.10">, 1997). </s>
<s n="s25.38;p3.10">Arguably, trips abroad are indeed high items on a student's annual budget, and many may be price sensitive; yet they are prepared to pay what is a relatively high price for their trip because they place high value on the <hi rend="italic">experience</hi> (Seekings, 1998). </s>
<s n="s26.38;p3.10">In some cases a student's parents bear the cost of educational trips, while in other cases, even if rare, students in full-time employ can cover costs (Carr, 2003; Smith <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s27.38;p3.10">, 1997). </s>
<s n="s28.38;p3.10">In a study of British university students, Carr (2003) found that despite living in financial debt, this did not deter students from local and global Travel. </s>
<s n="s29.38;p3.10">This supports the theory that students are gradually more accustomed to borrowing money, be it form banks, student loans, or relatives (Davies <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s30.38;p3.10">, 1995 cited in Carr, 2003). </s>
<s n="s31.38;p3.10">In fact, 2002 estimates saw an average student debt of £10,000 upon graduation (Anon., 2002a, cited in Carr, 2003). </s>
<s n="s32.38;p3.10">Nonetheless, students tend to stay longer and have higher total average spending than average adults (Seekings, 1998). </s>
<s n="s33.38;p3.10">Though preferring independent travel, some students travel as part of a degree or by ERASMUS and other such language exchange programmes (Carr, 2003). </s>
<s n="s34.38;p3.10">Technology has also impacted the segment by way of <hi rend="italic">virtual</hi> and <hi rend="italic">distance</hi> <hi rend="italic">education</hi>; offering the benefits of travel without the leaving home or the university (Carr, 2003; Holley, 2002). </s>
<s n="s35.38;p3.10">Studies show however, that while students believe such virtual excursions provide useful learning opportunities they can not, and should not, replace real excursions (Spicer <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s36.38;p3.10">2001 cited in Carr, 2003). </s>
<s n="s37.38;p3.10">In fact, students use formal and informal <hi rend="italic">holiday</hi> <hi rend="italic">information</hi> sources; that is, they rely on friends, family, and personal experience more than the web, travel agencies, and other tourism media (Carr, 2003). </s>
<s n="s38.38;p3.10">In summary, despite rising monetary issues, the number of university students is increasing and an eventual aim of tourism managers should be to better understand this major segment. </s>
</p>
<figure id="BAWE_3049c-fig.001"/>
<p n="p4.10">
<s n="s1.1;p4.10">The model proposed by <hi rend="italic">Woodside &amp; King</hi> (2001) is a depictive sequence of mental and observable sequences which consumers consider when buying and using several interrelated products or services; which in some cases may lead to further purchases. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.10">
<s n="s1.12;p5.10">As subsequently shown, the model entails three major boxes, which are further subdivided into nineteen variables related to consumer travel and tourism purchase-consumption frameworks. </s>
<s n="s2.12;p5.10">The eight variables in Box 1 influence thinking and planning actions prior and during travel; that is influence of family, friends, peers and groups have on a consumer's information gathering, problem solving, and overall decision making (Woodside <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s3.12;p5.10">, 2001). </s>
<s n="s4.12;p5.10">The eight variables within Box 2 relate to specific destinations and/or actions that make up the actual trip; in other words, the readily available choices to travellers including attractions, lodgings, and dining establishments (Woodside <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s5.12;p5.10">, 2001). </s>
<s n="s6.12;p5.10">Box 3 is a vital <hi rend="italic">evaluative</hi> stage of the framework relating to event - specific and global - specific evaluations, and possible implications, expressed upon concluding travel experiences (Woodside <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s7.12;p5.10">, 2001). </s>
<s n="s8.12;p5.10">Indeed such findings form the <hi rend="italic">Feedback Loop</hi> connecting Box 3 to Box 1; an indication of the level of consumer satisfaction and probable intentions to return to the destination (Woodside <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s9.12;p5.10">, 2001). </s>
<s n="s10.12;p5.10">Throughout the model, various direct and indirect predictors have interrelated affects on tourists' choice decisions; hence linking arrows imply <hi rend="italic">direct</hi> influences, with multiple-step linkages implying <hi rend="italic">indirect</hi> influences (Woodside <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s11.12;p5.10">, 2001). </s>
<s n="s12.12;p5.10">Overall, the framework 'shows three stages of pre-trip, during - trip, and after - trip information exposure, comprehension-acceptance, and decision to buy or reject (Woodside <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 2001, p.10). </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.10">
<s n="s1.3;p6.10">The question arises how to use the model to understand desired segments; in this case, how can the Globe improve its understating of university students. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p6.10">One such area of application includes the ability of the host-country and institution to provide desirable quality of reputation and lifestyle; deemed important incentives, or <hi rend="italic">pull</hi> factors, to university students (Mazzarol <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s3.3;p6.10">, 2002) and the subsequent topic of Box 2. </s>

</figure>
<p n="p7.10">
<s n="s1.17;p7.10">While limited research on university students may complicate the application of a behaviour model, under the assumption that such travellers search for similar motives as other educational tourists, the task is not impossible. </s>
<s n="s2.17;p7.10">To begin with, the analysis suggests England's reputable and educative characteristics; continue to attract both local and global students. </s>
<s n="s3.17;p7.10">Furthermore, as mentioned, the city capital of London is considered among the country's major hubs and tourist destinations. </s>
<s n="s4.17;p7.10">Thus <hi rend="italic">Mode/Route to Destination</hi>, and the Globe Theatre, may be gained by both local and global university students by various methods of transportation; generally speaking London is accessible by land, sea, and air. </s>
<s n="s5.17;p7.10">Similarly, <hi rend="italic">a</hi> choice of <hi rend="italic"> Mode/Routes in and Around</hi> the city facilitate the means for students to reach the Globe Theatre; which in fact provides web-links to <hi rend="italic">Transport for London</hi> (<seg type="URL" n="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tfl"/>) allowing students to independently plan their own transportation. </s>
<s n="s6.17;p7.10">Even so, there is only <hi rend="italic">one</hi> Shakespeare's Globe Theatre which inevitably limits students' <hi rend="italic">Destination Options/Choices</hi>; thus, the segment's propensity of seeking <hi rend="italic">cultural</hi> and <hi rend="italic">social</hi> experiences is restricted. </s>
<s n="s7.17;p7.10">Still the Globe Theatre offers a variety of educational <hi rend="italic">Activity Choices</hi>. </s>
<s n="s8.17;p7.10">From interactive lectures and workshops, to fencing classes, to performances and exhibitions; this vast selection can effectively enable the Theatre to meet the <hi rend="italic">social</hi>, <hi rend="italic">cultural</hi>, <hi rend="italic">physical</hi>, and to some extent <hi rend="italic">fantasy</hi> motives earlier mentioned. </s>
<s n="s9.17;p7.10">The Globe Shop could further add to the experience, albeit minimally, by offering <hi rend="italic">Self-gifts and other Purchases</hi> including Globe music CDs and Performances on DVD or books; thus not only providing a reflective gift with which to remember the trip, but a cultural "proof" of visit as an <hi rend="italic">Ego-enhancer</hi>. </s>
<s n="s10.17;p7.10">While three classes of on-site dining facilities meet the <hi rend="italic">social</hi> and <hi rend="italic">cultural</hi> motives sought by students, the Globe Theatre's lack of information on <hi rend="italic">Dining Out Choices</hi> available in London impacts the overall experience. </s>
<s n="s11.17;p7.10">On the one hand students may insight into English cuisine and table-etiquette, yet the cultural dining experience is thus confined. </s>
<s n="s12.17;p7.10">Ultimately, despite the provision of various activities, this does not mean the Globe Theatre would be the main attraction to students. </s>
<s n="s13.17;p7.10">Once again the propensity to seek further knowledge through travel would impact the <hi rend="italic">Attraction Choices</hi> available in the destination, possibly making the Globe Theatre one of many stopovers. </s>
<s n="s14.17;p7.10">In addition, while not as relevant as other variables, the Globe Theatre's lack of <hi rend="italic">Accommodation Choices</hi> could seriously impact the possibility of attracting students; particularly overseas students wishing to enrol in the theatre's one-year MA courses. </s>
<s n="s15.17;p7.10">Overall it is evident that the application of the proposed consumer behaviour model can generate an increasing awareness of what could motivate potential students to visit the Globe Theatre. </s>
<s n="s16.17;p7.10">Furthermore, the model indicates possible existing limitations which can positively or negatively impact the student segment. </s>
<s n="s17.17;p7.10">To some extent it can be argued that in some cases the affects of such limitations are only assumptions, and yet this raises a further issue relative to future trends; that is to say, what behavioural trends can be expected from university students in the next ten years. </s>
</p>
<figure id="BAWE_3049c-fig.003"/>
<p n="p8.10">
<s n="s1.15;p8.10">It is widely recognized that the pace of societal change impacts trends, be they economical, social, or lifestyle, and inevitably these trends impact tourism and other businesses (ETC, 2005; Middleton <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s2.15;p8.10">, 2001). </s>
<s n="s3.15;p8.10">Authors agree one trend is consumers becoming better educated and interested in continuing education by way of further schooling or educative tourism (ETC, 2005; Middleton <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s4.15;p8.10">, 2001; Ritchie <hi rend="italic"> et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s5.15;p8.10">, 2003). </s>
<s n="s6.15;p8.10">Yet this behavioural trend can be interrelated to other trends thus making it nearly impossible to isolate development into a single element (ETC, 2005). </s>
<s n="s7.15;p8.10">As suggested, an accurate definition of university students has yet to be formulated due to changing <hi rend="italic">social environments</hi>; and so it is advisable for the Globe Theatre to review its "student" target market (Ritchie <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s8.15;p8.10">, 2003). </s>
<s n="s9.15;p8.10">As depicted in the following table, such changes have broadened the definition of students to include pension-able adults and professionals; thus, targeting "older" generations, empty-nesters, and DINK couples, could increase the appeal of the Globe Theatre to a broader, educational tourism market. </s>
<s n="s10.15;p8.10">The additional impact of <hi rend="italic">technology</hi> and the web is also expected to grow, increasing demand for travel information, online bookings, and overall computer literacy (ETC, 2005; Middleton <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s11.15;p8.10">, 2001; Holley, 2002). </s>
<s n="s12.15;p8.10">As suggested, students remain unsure on the benefits of virtual seminars and distance learning. </s>
<s n="s13.15;p8.10">While the Globe Theatre provides such programmes, stressing the <hi rend="italic">social</hi> and <hi rend="italic">cultural</hi> benefits of more dynamic teachings could increase the attractiveness of learning through travel. </s>
<s n="s14.15;p8.10">Transportation in turn is developing faster, economical, and direct travel to desired destinations; and yet, road congestion and reduced coach travel is expected to be problematic (ETC, 2005). </s>
<s n="s15.15;p8.10">Although, the Globe Theatre is accessible by various modes, it would thus be suitable for the theatre to facilitate tourists' travel with suggestive comments on preferable modes of transport; namely trains, and the underground. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.10">
<s n="s1.13;p9.10">In order to meet the predicted behavioural trend of increased university student enrolment, the Globe Theatre would need to further improve on the Model implications previously indicated. </s>
<s n="s2.13;p9.10">In tackling the issue of <hi rend="italic">Destination Options/Choices</hi> it would be advisable for the Globe Theatre to cooperatively promote Shakespearean performing arts with other cities, including Plymouth and Stratford-Upon-Avon. </s>
<s n="s3.13;p9.10">Such a cooperative venture would increase the <hi rend="italic">cultural</hi> and <hi rend="italic">social</hi> elements available to students, while at the same time expanding into other student markets in other cities. </s>
<s n="s4.13;p9.10">Providing more <hi rend="italic">Dining Out Choices</hi> is also recommendable, as this could increase students' perception of the Globe's efforts to meet the <hi rend="italic">cultural</hi> motives for educational travel. </s>
<s n="s5.13;p9.10">Moreover, publicising dining locations throughout London could generate increased awareness of the Globe Theatre; that is by way of <hi rend="italic">socializing</hi>, students would spread word of mouth to locals and foreigners. </s>
<s n="s6.13;p9.10">Similar impacts could be witnessed by way of providing further <hi rend="italic">Attraction Choices</hi>. </s>
<s n="s7.13;p9.10">A recommendation would therefore be to form a marketing alliance with other <hi rend="italic">cultural</hi> heritage sites in the vicinity such as St. Paul's Cathedral, Tate Modern, and Tower Bridge. </s>
<s n="s8.13;p9.10">This could increase the perceived educational attractiveness of both the Southwark area and the efforts of the Globe Theatre in facilitating students' learning opportunities. </s>
<s n="s9.13;p9.10">While it is true the Globe Theatre's main purpose is to provide an educational experience through theatrical performances, the lack of accommodations could quite possibly affect students' perceptions. </s>
<s n="s10.13;p9.10">A final recommendation would hence be to provide information on neighbouring lodging facilities including hotels, hostels, and guest houses. </s>
<s n="s11.13;p9.10">This would benefit the Globe Theatre in the long run, assuming the growing number of university students would require somewhere to stay if enrolled in a year-long MA, or short period programme. </s>
<s n="s12.13;p9.10">Not only would the students gain a <hi rend="italic">social</hi> and <hi rend="italic">cultural</hi> experience by interacting together, they could learn to habituate themselves with living in England, albeit for a short period of time. </s>
<s n="s13.13;p9.10">An illustrative interpretation of such proposed recommendations is subsequently included on the final page of this essay. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.10">
<s n="s1.10;p10.10">As already noted, the study of consumer behaviour ultimately seeks to gain information to enforce the comprehensive understanding of tourists' decision - making processes. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p10.10">Such information ultimately benefits both the political and tourism aspects of a destination by way of facilitating, and improving, industry planning (Woodside <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s3.10;p10.10">, 2001). </s>
<s n="s4.10;p10.10">Moreover, by way of predictive consumer behaviour models, marketers may study the intricate relationships of consumer behaviour on a micro level; the theory being the relative findings, once overlaid on to a macro level, aid in developing more effective marketing to desired segments (Woodside <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s5.10;p10.10">, 2001). </s>
<s n="s6.10;p10.10">As discussed, the aim of the essay was to provide an evaluative extract as to how the successful use of a consumer behaviour model, could help to enhance a tourism manager's understanding of a particular segment. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p10.10">In the case of the Shakespeare's Globe Theatre the goal of providing an overall educational experience, can be positively linked to the university student segment. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p10.10">As indicated however, the lack of <hi rend="italic">specific</hi> behavioural information regarding students may complicate the relevance and overall findings of such a study. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p10.10">Nevertheless, the findings would suggest that in an effort to better meet the predicted behavioural trends of a growing <hi rend="italic">education</hi> inclined tourism market, the theatre stands to generate considerable profit. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p10.10">With world tourism predicted to grow to include added elements relating to the arts, culture, and history; the Globe Theatre looks set to gain a significant advantage, by way of effective marketing, and in becoming a component in a complex decision-making process. </s>
