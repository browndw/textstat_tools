<s n="s2.2;p10.60">For e.g. some varieties of apples and pears develop a pink tinge on canning, rhubarb and some cherry varieties become bleached due to migration of colour into canning syrups, and chlorophyll is converted into brown-green phaeophytin during the heat processing of green vegetables </s>

<s n="s2.3;p16.60">The determination of the concentration of sugars in the syrup should take into consideration the quantity and nature of sugars that will be contributed by the fruit and the proportion of fruit to syrup in the container. </s>

<s n="s1.11;p17.60">Both syrup and fruit are generally consumed; it must have pleasing organoleptic properties. </s>
<s n="s2.11;p17.60">The viscosity is an important factor in the thermal processing as well as organoleptically. </s>
<s n="s3.11;p17.60">The syrup can also be the carrier and supplier of substances to improve the or alter the colour, flavour and texture of the product. </s>

<s n="s7.11;p17.60">DE is a measure of the degree of the conversion of starch to reducing sugars. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p17.60">There are advantages in using a combination of sucrose and glucose syrups over using sucrose alone. </s>
<s n="s9.11;p17.60">The rheological properties can be maintained without excessive sweetness, especially in fruits that have low acid levels. </s>
<s n="s10.11;p17.60">The physico- chemical and organoleptic qualities can be better maintained in glucose syrups then they can in sucrose as they cannot be hydrolyzed further even in the presence of very acidic fruits. </s>
<s n="s11.11;p17.60">They have a favourable effect on the product, prevent the flow of aromatic compounds from the fruit to the syrup and moderate the acid taste better than does a sucrose at a given sweetness level. </s>
</p>
<p n="p18.60">
<s n="s1.3;p18.60">A strong sucrose concentration in the syrup creates a higher gradient between the syrup and the fruit, and favours diffusion of fluids from the fruit to the syrup. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p18.60">During storage, the dry extractable matter diffuses from the syrup into the tissues, which results in an increase drained weight up to the establishment of the final equilibrium. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p18.60">Therefore the yield (drained weight) is dependent upon the packing medium composition, the particle size, and the shape of the fruit. </s>

<s n="s2.7;p19.60">Blanching removes gases from within the tissue and softens the product. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p19.60">Blanching makes the product easier to fill into the can and obtain the correct weight. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p19.60">The removal of the gas also reduces the oxidation of the product, maintains vacuum in the can, and prevents corrosion. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p19.60">Blanching gives the product another washing treatment and inactivates enzymes which may cause deterioration of the food. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p19.60">Enzyme inactivation is not as important to canned foods as it is for frozen foods, as canned foods receive a far greater heat treatment during thermal processing of the can. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p19.60">Typical blanch times in near boiling water are 60 to 90 secs for small objects, such as green peas and diced carrot, and up to 3 min for larger peas. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p20.60">Water blanching is of simple design, robust and least expensive to buy. </s>

<s n="s3.3;p20.60">The water heated by the hot blanched product in the cooling section is cooled in a heat exchanger which in turn is used to heat the water in the preheat section, providing economy in the use of water and energy. </s>
</p>
<p n="p21.60">
<s n="s1.4;p21.60">Steam Blanching is quite common since almost all the canneries have an adequate supply of low-pressure steam. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p21.60">The simplest design has a metal mesh conveyor that moves through a tunnel with steam jets located under the conveyor. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p21.60">To minimise the e loss of steam the two ends are closed by curtains. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p21.60">This method is inexpensive and easy to manufacture but they are prone to temperature variations due to the effect of air currents. </s>
</p>
<p n="p22.60">
<s n="s1.2;p22.60">Blanching under higher steam pressures increase the temperature, improves steam convection, increases the blanching rate, decreases steam loss, and produces higher reduction in the microbial contamination. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p22.60">Airlocks limit the loss of steam and further heat loss by radiation is minimised by appropriate insulation. </s>

<s n="s3.9;p23.60">Precision and accuracy are dependent upon the type, state, shape, and size of the product. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p23.60">For solid products, the particle size has a direct influence on the fill precision (i.e. reproducibility).For many products and container types; an appropriate head space is a critical factor in the attainment of the required vacuum in the sealed container. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p23.60">Excessive head space can result in an excess of air in the final product, which can result in an excess of air in the final product, which can accelerate product oxidation and eventually cause internal container corrosion. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p23.60">Insufficient head space can lead to permanent deformation of the container ends possible leakage due to the expansion of the product and contained gases, which would render the product unsaleable. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p23.60">During thermal processing, the product is in continuous contact with the hot cover liquid osmotic exchanges take place. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p23.60">Therefore, the solid components of some products during thermal treatment and to a lesser degree during storage are going to either take on or lose weight. </s>

<s n="s3.9;p32.60">Steam is an excellent heat medium because of its ability to condense on container surfaces releasing large amounts of latent heat. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p32.60">The main enemy of efficient heating in a closed vessel (eg.retort) using saturated steam is the presence of entrapped air especially that trapped in the small spaces between containers in the load. </s>

<s n="s6.9;p32.60">For e.g. any given location 10% of air by volume will reduce the temperature by about 3ËšC, which will have a dramatic effect on product sterilisation. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p32.60">This means that in order to bring about efficient and uniform heating, air must be purged, or vented from the retort at the start of the process. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p32.60">It was achieved at the start of the operating cycle by introducing high velocity steam into the retort. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p32.60">This steam was allowed to pass through the vessels at the bottom and exit through a vent at the top since the retort was a vertical orientation type. </s>
