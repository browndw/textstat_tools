<p>The British Academic Written English (BAWE) corpus was developed at the Universities of Warwick, Reading and Oxford Brookes, under the directorship of Hilary Nesi and Sheena Gardner (formerly of the Centre for Applied Linguistics [previously called CELTE], Warwick), Paul Thompson (Department of Applied Linguistics, Reading) and Paul Wickens (Westminster Institute of Education, Oxford Brookes), with funding from the ESRC. Subject to the rights of the these institutions in the BAWE corpus, and pursuant to the ESRC agreement, the BAWE corpus is available to researchers for research purposes PROVIDED THAT the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>1. The corpus files are not distributed in either their original form or in modified form.</p>
<p>2. The texts are used for research purposes only; they should not be reproduced in teaching materials.</p>
<p>3. The texts are not reproduced in full for a wider audience/readership, although researchers are free to quote short passages of text (up to 200 running words from any given text).</p>
<p>4. The BAWE corpus developers (contact: BAWE@warwick.ac.uk) are informed of all projects, dissertations, theses, presentations or publications arising from analysis of the corpus.</p>

<s n="s1.1;p1.8">The aim of this experiment was to analysis my diet over 3 days, by weighing all foods consumed and inputting the results into a computer data base (foodbase 3.1 standard Edition),and to assess this method of dietary analysis. </s>

<p n="p2.8">
<s n="s1.1;p2.8">These results were then compared to known DRVs to highlight any deficiencies, or over consumption, and possible ways in which my diet could be improved. </s>

<s n="s2.2;p3.8">Diary analysis showed that my intake falls short of the EAR for my age and sex by 314 kilocalories. </s>

<p n="p4.8">
<s n="s1.5;p4.8">By increasing my energy consumption the shortfall in nutrients in my diet which are below the DRVs could be addressed. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p4.8">However the EAR is only a guide. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p4.8">My total energy expenditure will be my BMR, dietary induced thermogenesis, and the total amount of energy that I use in physical activity (DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, 1991). </s>
<s n="s4.5;p4.8">This will vary within the population dependant on factors such as sex, height, weight, age, physical activity. </s>

<p n="p5.8">
<s n="s1.5;p5.8">My fibre intake for the 3 day period averaged 10.4 g per day this falls well below the DVR of 18g. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p5.8">An increase in fibre could be achieved by eating pulses, wholegrain foods, and eating a greater amount of vegetables and fruit. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p5.8">(WILLS, J. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p5.8">2005) An increase in my energy intake with these foods will also increase the levels of iron and iodine, which fell below the DRVs. </s>

<p n="p6.8">
<s n="s1.2;p6.8">My calcium intake was 547 mg an average of 153 mg less than the DRV. To increase calcium in my diet I could include more dairy produce, which provides a good source of calcium, as well as dark green leafy vegetables and the soft bones of seafood if eaten whole, e.g. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p7.8">Advantages of the weighed method are that it is quantitative, portions can be measured accurately. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p7.8">It is a widely used method and can be compared to other studies. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p7.8">This method was found to have high reproducibility of results, which led to the assumption of the validity. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p7.8">Measurements with different methods however gave different results. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p7.8">With the use of doubly labelled water it was found that individuals often under report their energy intakes, especially if they have a high BMI. Hence care should be taken to consider sources of error and how they may alter the results of using any diet assessments (GEISSLER &amp; POWERS,2006) </s>

<s n="s3.5;p8.8">Some of the foods that I consumed were not on the data base and I had to add the nearest equivalent. </s>
