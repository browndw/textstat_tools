<s n="s1.4;p1.15">The law on corporate manslaughter is undoubtedly an area in our present system which is subject to much criticism especially with the increasing number of death occurring in the workplace. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p1.15">According to an article by the Professional Health and Safety Consultants, "<hi rend="italic">there are still around 300 avoidable deaths in the workplace every year</hi>"<ref target="BAWE_0120c-ftnote.001"/>. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p1.15">Indeed, this makes us ponder about the effectiveness of our present law especially that some recent statistics (as at 10 January 2004) showed that only seven companies have been convicted of manslaughter so far<ref target="BAWE_0120c-ftnote.002"/>. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p1.15">As we shall see, the debate is mainly about how to attribute fault to a corporation and how effectively the law has overcome this problem or is there any scope for reform of the law. </s>

<head rend="bold">The Present Law</head>
<p n="p2.15">
<s n="s1.5;p2.15">According to the present law on corporate manslaughter, the only way of convicting a corporation is through the identification principle. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p2.15">Under this technique, those who control the company are considered as embodying the company so that their mind can be imputed to the company itself. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p2.15">It is a question for the jury to decide who can be regarded as the directing and controlling mind of a company. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p2.15">In brief, the main issue for the courts is how to attribute to a company the acts and states of mind of its employees for corporate criminal liability to arise, provided that these acts and states of mind satisfy the prerequisites for manslaughter. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p2.15">When a corporation is found guilty, the punishment is in the form of a fine because a corporation as such is not physical and thus, cannot be imprisoned. </s>

<head rend="bold">Liability for manslaughter under the Present Law</head>
<p n="p3.15">
<s n="s1.3;p3.15">We shall now consider whether BloggsBuild Ltd or any individual might be guilty of manslaughter under the present law. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p3.15">The first step is to assess whether each employee might be individually liable, then consider whether their act and state of mind could be imputed to the corporation. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p3.15">It is important to bear in mind that the death resulted from the acts of various individuals so that it is also necessary to consider issues of causation. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.15">
<s n="s1.4;p4.15">Criminal liability for the individuals will be one of gross negligence manslaughter because there is no 'malice aforethought' and the single test devised by the Court in <hi rend="underlined italic">Adamako</hi>
<ref target="BAWE_0120c-ftnote.003"/> will be used. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p4.15">First there is the need to establish whether the defendant was in breach of a duty of care towards the victim. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p4.15">Then, the next step is to see whether that breach of duty was the cause of the defendant's death and finally, the last step is whether that breach of duty amounted to gross negligence. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p4.15">The test for gross negligence as per <hi rend="italic">Lord Mackay LC</hi> in the same case will be "<hi rend="italic">whether, having regard to the risk of death involved, the conduct of the defendant was so bad in all circumstances as to amount in the jury's judgment to a criminal act or omission</hi>"<ref target="BAWE_0120c-ftnote.004"/>. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p5.15">Considering Sid's case, the question for the courts might be whether as a scaffolder he had the duty towards any eventual user of the scaffolding to ensure its stability and safety. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p5.15">On the assumption that Sid was in breach of a duty of care towards the victim, his case might fail on causation purposes since Colin's swinging the jib of the crane into the scaffolding might be regarded as a novus actus interveniens. . </s>
<s n="s3.6;p5.15">Thus, Sid's conduct may not in the first place satisfy the actus rea for manslaughter. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p5.15">As for the mens rea of manslaughter, he may not have the required knowledge about safety standards such that the risk of danger would have been obvious to him. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p5.15">In conclusion the courts might not find his conduct so gross as to amount to a criminal act. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p5.15">It can rather be said that it is Malcolm who had the responsibility of ensuring that the scaffolding complied with the safety regulations since it is his signature which is required on the form. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.15">
<s n="s1.10;p6.15">As for Colin, it can be argued in his favour that since he did not have the duty to operate the crane in the first place, he could not owe a duty of care. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p6.15">However, it can be counter-argued that by volunteering to do the job, he has also voluntarily assumed the responsibility<ref target="BAWE_0120c-ftnote.005"/> of driving the crane in a safe manner. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p6.15">Hence, a legal duty of care arises. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p6.15">But though he might be in breach of a duty of care which caused the death, his inexperience might pose a problem for the courts to establish whether his conduct was grossly negligent. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p6.15">Being inexperienced, he cannot be expected to perform the job like one who is trained and experienced. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p6.15">In the case of the death of Lee James Smith in November 1999, two farm owners were convicted of manslaughter for leaving a JCB potato loader in the control of a trainee, who was crushed to death after the equipment was hit by a lorry. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p6.15">The "<hi rend="italic">Birmingham Crown Court heard that</hi> "<hi rend="italic">the JCB should not have been under the control of an untrained 16 year old with very limited experience of operating such a large, potentially dangerous piece of equipment</hi>""<ref target="BAWE_0120c-ftnote.006"/>. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p6.15">Indeed, it is Malcolm's fault for failing to check Colin's qualifications. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p6.15">Besides, it should have been obvious to him that Colin may not have the required skill for the latter is only an apprentice carpenter. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p6.15">Moreover, being inexperienced might mean that Colin was unconscious as to the fact that he was manipulating the crane in a dangerous way, and therefore any risk of harm might not have been obvious to him. </s>

<s n="s1.8;p7.15">On all grounds, Malcolm seems to be at fault. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p7.15">Based on his relationship with the victim as the site manager supervising his activities, a breach of duty of care can be established. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p7.15">He owes a duty of care towards Vince, just as any other worker, to ensure his safety and health, and has undoubtedly failed to do so. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p7.15">He had knowledge that there were insufficient clamps and nevertheless instructed the scaffolder to carry on with the work. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p7.15">He even gave his approval that the scaffolding complied with the safety regulations without even inspecting it. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p7.15">Moreover, he omitted to check Colin's qualification and did not take any action when other workers reported to him the way in which the crane was being dangerously operated in a very unpredictable manner. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p7.15">This clearly shows his indifference to the risk of harm in the workplace. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p7.15">His conduct clearly falls far below what is expected of him as a site manager making him individually liable. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.15">
<s n="s1.6;p8.15">Since Malcolm's conduct can potentially satisfy the prerequisites for gross negligence manslaughter, it is now necessary to consider the possibility of whether his conduct might be attributed to the corporation. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p8.15">Being the site manager, he is obviously well placed in the hierarchy of the company. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p8.15">In <hi rend="underlined italic">Tesco Supermarkets Ltd v Natrass</hi>
<ref target="BAWE_0120c-ftnote.007"/>, it was held that the 'branch manager' was "<hi rend="italic">not part of the "mind" of the company</hi>"<ref target="BAWE_0120c-ftnote.008"/> because supervision of the details of operations in a retail shop is not part of the function of higher management<ref target="BAWE_0120c-ftnote.009"/>.This defence could be potentially applied to a 'site manager' case. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p8.15">Besides, there is clearly the existence of an obvious individual within the company against whom proceedings can be brought<ref target="BAWE_0120c-ftnote.010"/>. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p8.15">The court will be reluctant to find corporate fault as the act was committed by another person. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p8.15">Indeed, Malcolm is the one who negligently failed to supervise the work properly and should therefore be solely liable. </s>

<p n="p10.15">
<s n="s1.7;p10.15">The identification principle has been greatly criticised for being narrow in its scope as seen through its application in <hi rend="underlined italic">Tesco Supermarkets Ltd v Natrass</hi>
<ref target="BAWE_0120c-ftnote.013"/>. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p10.15">It first depends on fault to be found at the individual level, and then even if a blameworthy individual can be identified, he/she must be the controlling mind of the company for corporate liability to arise. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p10.15">Besides, the more complex the management and the bigger the company is, the greater the difficulty to apply the principle. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p10.15">Indeed, the first case where prosecution for manslaughter resulted in the conviction of a company was in the case of <hi rend="underlined italic">Kite and OLL Ltd</hi>
<ref target="BAWE_0120c-ftnote.014"/> which was a one-man company. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p10.15">Although the limited scope of the identification principle can somewhat be said to be partially supplemented by prosecutions for breach under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974, the problem is that the Health and Safety Executives (HSE) would only press charges in extreme cases that they believe represent a blatant breach of the Act. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p10.15">And consequently only 20% of workplace deaths resulted into company prosecutions<ref target="BAWE_0120c-ftnote.015"/>. </s>
