<s n="s1.5;p2.11">Central government grants come in the form of the Formula Grant System, which sets spending totals to take into account the costs to local authorities as a result of providing local services, specific grants, supplementary grants, transitional grants and the Revenue Support Grant (RSG), which is considered the most important. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p2.11">The RSG is an annual grant given by central government to local authorities and is the part of aggregate external finance that is not provided from business rates or specific and special grants. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p2.11">Around 48% form the majority of local government revenue and 25% comes from business taxation. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p2.11">The Government distributes this grant so that if every authority set its budget at the level of its formula spending share, then the council tax would be the same for all properties in the same valuation band throughout England. </s>

<s n="s1.1;p3.11">The RSG is made up of its standard spending assessment (SSA), less the amount it will get from the national pool of business rates and the amount it would get if council tax is set at a national standard rate.
