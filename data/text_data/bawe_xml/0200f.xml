<s n="s1.5;p1.76">The increased competition in the marketplace is a looming danger to CFS's competitive advantage and long-term survival. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p1.76">Therefore, a reorganisation in aim of financial and customer service enhancement has been proposed. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p1.76">The project will have significant, long-term changes to the structure and daily operation of CFS. It necessitates the adoption of a new business model because it requires flexible working rather than the current rigid specialisation of the insurance sectors. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p1.76">Internet links to high street agents will also be utilized and a project team will be adopted to manage the already approved changes. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p1.76">This report discusses the key considerations and gives recommendations for the implementation of the project in question. </s>

<head rend="underlined bold">The Key Project Stakeholders</head>
<p n="p2.76">
<s n="s1.5;p2.76">It is particularly recommended that the complex and conflicting project stakeholder needs are considered and managed. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p2.76">This is because certain stakeholders who have a high interest and/or influence over the project's activities can affect the implementation, operation and eventual project outcome. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p2.76">Therefore, it is important that the key project stakeholders are identified and classified according to their interest and project influence so those with a high interest and/or influence can be managed suitably. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p2.76">This helps to efficiently prioritise management's time over the stakeholder groups. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p2.76">The analysis starts with the essential internal stakeholders: </s>
</p>
<div2>
<head rend="bold">1. Key Employee Groups: </head>
<p n="p3.76">
<s n="s1.5;p3.76">(I.e. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p3.76">HR Department, IT Department, Section Managers, ODG*, project team &amp; all insurance sector employees.) </s>
<s n="s3.5;p3.76">These have a high <hi rend="italic">interest</hi> in the project since it will affect their daily working lives. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p3.76">They are likely to react strongly to the project because it will change their amount of responsibility, enrichment, training, flexibility and potentially their workload and overtime. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p3.76">Financial merit and non-financial recognition can improve employee motivation (this was not arranged in the 2001 restructure, resulting in discontent). </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.76">
<s n="s1.6;p4.76">Additionally, employees have a substantial <hi rend="italic">influence</hi> over the project's success. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p4.76">For example, an accumulation of resistance to change, low morale and motivation can lead to low labour productivity and poor customer service. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p4.76">(N.B. The employees are prone to resisting the project.) </s>
<s n="s4.6;p4.76">This increases costs and customer dissatisfaction, damaging CFS's competitive edge. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p4.76">Thus, employees must accept and effectively operate the new working practices so gain their cooperation and seriously involve them via meetings, emails, suggestion boxes and more. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p4.76">Also, trade union satisfaction arises from overall employee satisfaction. </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="bold">3. Trade Unions: </head>
<p n="p5.76">
<s n="s1.2;p5.76">There're 2 unions which both exert a strong <hi rend="italic">influence</hi> over the project because they own 40% of CFS shares and 60% of CFS employees are trade union members. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p5.76">Since the project will impact on the employees, the trade unions have a high <hi rend="italic"> stake</hi> in it. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.76">
<s n="s1.3;p6.76">Trade unions dislike being kept unaware of changes. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p6.76">So, to prevent conflict, invite both trade unions to participate in the project and use the formal procedure agreements in place to inform and collectively bargain with trade union representatives and shop stewards in the Works Committee. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p6.76">Throughout the project, keep them informed via reports &amp; meetings to cover issues such as training, working hours, pay matters, job content and job security. </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="bold">4. Service suppliers: </head>
<p n="p7.76">
<s n="s1.2;p7.76">The external high-street agents will be highly <hi rend="italic">interested</hi> in increasing their efficiency through using a more simple communications procedure and dealing with fewer employees at CFS. However, the agents will sell CFS insurance regardless of the project outcome so their <hi rend="italic">influence</hi> is low. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p7.76">It is important to consult, cooperate and communicate the benefits of the project to agents via meetings and progress reports. </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="bold">5. Shareholders:</head>
<p n="p8.76">
<s n="s1.3;p8.76">The large, external shareholders are more likely to have a high <hi rend="italic">interest</hi> in their investment and high <hi rend="italic">influence</hi> in internal decision-making concerning the project. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p8.76">Shareholders who disagree with the project can sell their shares. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p8.76">Such shareholders, potential investors and funding agencies must be kept informed of the project via several reports. </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="bold">6. Customers:</head>
<p n="p9.76">
<s n="s1.3;p9.76">Customers have no authority over the project and are generally only interested in service changes rather than the internal operating process. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p9.76">This makes them a low <hi rend="italic">interest</hi> and low <hi rend="italic">influence</hi> external stakeholder. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p9.76">However, it is beneficial to communicate the new service improvements to them especially the timesaving and relationship-building upgrades. </s>

<head rend="underlined bold">The Project Aim &amp; Objectives </head>
<p n="p10.76">
<s n="s1.1;p10.76">Defining the project is key to its success because it makes evaluation much easier and gives a clear focus to all those involved, which prevents employees from working against each other. </s>

<p n="p11.76">
<s n="s1.2;p11.76">To achieve better financial &amp; competitive performance by improving customer service &amp; the long-term efficiency &amp; effectiveness of operations. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p11.76">This will be achieved via the adoption of Internet links to agents and the reorganisation of operations into multi-purpose teams covering all five insurance sectors except life insurance. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.76">
<s n="s1.1;p12.76">Do not change this statement or the vision will be lost, so ensure that all key stakeholders accept it, before implementing the operation and implementation objectives. </s>

<s n="s4.6;p16.76">Further evaluation and/or training may be required if employees do not feel fully competent. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p16.76">Use 'mystery caller' tests, where a trainer randomly calls employees (who are unaware of this) to see how well they cope with specific queries. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p16.76">This removes employee bias but takes time since many calls are needed for accuracy. </s>
</p>
<p n="p17.76">
<s n="s1.2;p17.76">Alternatively, ask employees if they believe that they have been well trained via one-to-one interviews and/or focus groups. </s>

<p n="p27.76">
<s n="s1.2;p27.76">The following arbitrary scales have been used to classify each risk: To indicate the probability of an uncertainty occurring: <hi rend="underlined">improbable</hi> (1-3), <hi rend="underlined">likely</hi> (4-6) &amp; <hi rend="underlined">highly likely</hi> (7-10). </s>

<head rend="bold">Environmental Risk 1: The Marketplace Trend for Internet Selling</head>
<p n="p28.76">
<s n="s1.2;p28.76">In the "increasingly competitive" marketplace, CFS will lose business as a result of being reactive (as we were with telephone selling) and not proactive to market trends, in particular the Internet selling trend. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p28.76">This is an opportunity to increase our customer base because the Internet is much more accessible to customers who demand quotes and information online. </s>
</p>
<p n="p29.76">
<s n="s1.7;p29.76">I ask if CFS is pursuing the right project because loosing out on Internet sales is highly likely to occur (probability score of 8). </s>
<s n="s2.7;p29.76">It may be starting to happen now. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p29.76">This could eventually impact (impact score 5) on the long-tem profitability of CFS and the achievement of objectives 6, 7 and 8. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p29.76">Therefore, CFS should mitigate against this risk by either outsourcing the creation of a website now (if it is too ambitious for the IT Department to do both projects simultaneously) or gradually expand the IT Department's role. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p29.76">The latter option would be cheaper but slower. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p29.76">The website could just offer information online so customers still have to phone (&amp; receive a personal service) to get their quote. </s>

<p n="p30.76">
<s n="s1.7;p30.76">If a well-established competitor with a "personal and effective service" decides to expand into the Midlands, CFS will have to look for new ways of gaining a competitive edge by making their service better or by differentiating. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p30.76">Furthermore, a large competitor could offer lower prices, through economies of scale, which would be difficult for CFS to beat. </s>
