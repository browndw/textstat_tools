<p n="p1.47">
<s n="s1.3;p1.47">Semiotics, that is, the science of signs, and the use of organisational analysis, can be used to great effect throughout the development lifecycle of an e-commerce system. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p1.47">This document attempts to apply these theories and relate to the business functions and associated IT strategies to demonstrate their usefulness. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p1.47">This Author will also attempt to relate a measure of personal understanding and experience along with information provided from thorough research from a multitude of resources, both in print and electronic. </s>

<div1 type="section">
<p n="p2.47">
<s n="s1.4;p2.47">Many consider e-Business, and the design of e-Business systems, to be a modern discipline, something that has only occurred with the coming of the 90's, Microsoft Windows, and the World Wide Web. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p2.47">However, contrary to the belief of many unfamiliar with the field, Information Technology has been used to supplement and enhance business practice for decades now - and the coming of the Information Age only builds upon this. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p2.47">Semiotics is an even older discipline. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p2.47">Historically employed in the fields of psychology and linguistics, many working in the Information industry have now begun to realise the potential and the value of employing this science in the development of information systems. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.47">
<s n="s1.5;p3.47">The first step in the design of an E-Commerce system for business is to put aside many of the preconceptions. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p3.47">Many such ventures have turned disastrous, with large companies emerging from the 1980s with huge, unwieldy organisational structures, and attempting to follow the (initially, very successful-seeming) suit of the Dot Com enterprises that sprung up overnight. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p3.47">These lightweight organisations were able to initially succeed due to their rapid ability to change to keep up with market trends, and to adapt their organisation to their business model and tailor it to the demands of electronic commerce. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p3.47">Too many leaders of big business, with, as stated by Chu and Smithson, 'large companies with rigid bureaucratic structures that spanned the globe'<hi rend="sup">[8]</hi>, have made the mistake of assuming that merely technological changes need to be matched- employ the right computer systems, design a leading-edge system, and all is well. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p3.47">This was, all too often, disastrous. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.47">
<s n="s1.1;p4.47">Semiotics and Organisational Analysis techniques detail the necessity to describe organisations, and the E-Business systems they wish to employ, in terms of communication - capturing the stages, processes and actors involved, so that E-Business can be aligned to support the business functions, not be at odds with them. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.47">
<s n="s1.6;p5.47">The addition of E-Commerce to support one or more business functions can be, according to Beynon-Davis, achieved through five distinct models, based largely on the degree of integration of the system with the business, and largely dependent on environment and type of product or service, and industry within which the organisation operates <hi rend="sup"> [4]</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p5.47">These five models are, ranging from the most integrated to the most separate system integration: <hi rend="italic">Separate organisation, Parallel organisation, Semi-Autonomous organisation, Fully integrated within informatics service,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"> Fully integrated organisation</hi>. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p5.47">These models describe ways in which an organisation can support business functions through the employment of E-Business either in-house, in a carbon-copy organisation set up to deal purely with electronic transactions, or through a third-party, to a fully integrated system. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p5.47">Chong and Liu state that 'An e-commerce system cannot be treated as a trading tool isolated from business norms. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p5.47">Benefits are gained from the way we use e-commerce systems, not from their technological components.<hi rend="sup">[9]</hi>'. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p5.47">Time and again, authors and experts in the field stress the importance that E-Commerce should be treated as an aid and supplement to support existing business functions - not as a 'bolt-on extra' or 'magic bullet'. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.47">
<s n="s1.2;p6.47">The design of an E-Commerce system almost always is preceded one or more processes of user requirements determination specification. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p6.47">When designing such a system to support the alignment of the IT infrastructure and existing business practice and processes, correct requirements specification is a necessity - and Semiotics and Organisational Analysis can help. </s>

<p n="p7.47">
<s n="s1.18;p7.47">The day-to-day business functions and operations are governed by a number of social norms - both formally represented in codes of practice, established procedures, and rules, and informal norms that form the culture of an organisation. </s>
<s n="s2.18;p7.47">Accurately determining these norms and building them in to the design of an E-Commerce system as constrains and assumptions allows business functions to be better represented. </s>
<s n="s3.18;p7.47">For instance, this Author was responsible for assisting in the re-development of a medium-sized secondary school network, upgrading the network management software and operating system. </s>
<s n="s4.18;p7.47">Part of the upgrade gave users the ability to change their logon passwords at their workstations. </s>
<s n="s5.18;p7.47">However, it is the accepted practice that all students other than the sixth form must come to the IT Support helpdesk to request password changes due to them commonly changing passwords and subsequently forgetting them- thus generating a high volume of password reset requests. </s>
<s n="s6.18;p7.47">It is generally accepted that the younger students must come to the office to request a change of password, to dissuade them from changing their passwords unless absolutely necessary. </s>
<s n="s7.18;p7.47">This is an example of a business norm - no where was the practice documented or specified - it is just a generally accepted and established practice. </s>
<s n="s8.18;p7.47">The ability to disable personal password changes at the workstation had to be represented in the design of the new system - an example of analysing, specifying and representing business norms in development of IS/IT systems. </s>
<s n="s9.18;p7.47">At the time, however, the requirements for the new system were not accurately specified, to the degree where norms such as this were not considered and remained unrepresented in the system. </s>
<s n="s10.18;p7.47">A better method of eliciting user requirements to take into account such norms and requirements was needed - and this is where Organisational Analysis can help. </s>
<s n="s11.18;p7.47">MEASUR (Methods for Eliciting, Analysing and Specifying Users' Requirements) is a technique for social-level analysis of an organisation to model business systems and assist in uncovering, exposing and documenting in a logical and structured way the underlying norms of an organisation. </s>
<s n="s12.18;p7.47">MEASUR includes five major methods for using Semiotics to determine requirements: Problem Articulation Method (PAM), Semantic Analysis Method (SAM), Norm Analysis Method (NAM), Communication &amp; Control Analysis, and Meta-System Analysis. </s>
<s n="s13.18;p7.47">These methods will not all be explained in detail, as many volumes of information on them can be found, with the references in the appendix of this document providing at least a good grounding in them. </s>
<s n="s14.18;p7.47">It is of their applicability to the design of E-Business systems that is of particular interest. </s>
<s n="s15.18;p7.47">The underpinnings of any successful E-Commerce systems are cases where technology has been used to support business functions, norms, processes, and allow the management to concentrate on what they do best - that organisation's business - with technology acting as the enabler for enhanced or expanded activity. </s>
<s n="s16.18;p7.47">Leer writes 'At the turn of the century, most organizations with their own web sites consider themselves 'wired', but they are simply using the web site for old-style marketing and information purposes - somewhere to post a glorified product catalogue <hi rend="sup"> [2]</hi>'.Almost inevitably, shoehorning organisations into technology, and forcing unwelcome change or detrimental practices on an organisation for the sake of the technology will lead to failure. </s>
<s n="s17.18;p7.47">Businesses and organisations wishing to make best use of IT need not an IT or E-Commerce strategy - they need business strategies that embrace E-Commerce, along with its opportunities and risks <hi rend="sup">[2]</hi>. </s>
<s n="s18.18;p7.47">It is through semiotic theory and organisational analysis that the social, interpersonal, and communication aspects can be considered when designing E-Commerce systems, rather than the technology-lead approach all too often taken by organisations. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.47">
<s n="s1.6;p8.47">Before the design of an E-Business system, it is important to examine exactly the types of E-Business implementations that exist, from an organisational point of view. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p8.47">Typically, there are three types of E-Business: Business-to-Customer (B2C), Business-to-Business (B2B), and Business-to-Employee (B2E). </s>
<s n="s3.6;p8.47">Each type of E-Business features the most basic unit conceptualisation of its communications between related parties - the transaction. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p8.47">Gordon and Gordon define a transaction as 'A unit of business activity, such as purchasing a product, making a banking deposit, or reserving an airline seat <hi rend="sup">[6]</hi>'. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p8.47">It is by analysing these transactions, and discovering the semantics and pragmatics that govern them, that we can begin to understand the underlying business processes and encapsulate them, and support them by building technological solutions around them. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p8.47">By understanding how the signs associated with these transactions are created and communicated within the context and culture of the organisation(s), areas where technology can be applied to achieve benefit can be readily identified. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.47">
<s n="s1.3;p9.47">One such method for semiotic analysis of organisations will be examined and applied to the issue of designing an E-Business system - that of the Semiotic Framework. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p9.47">This specifies six divisions of the structure and function of signs (within an organisation, in this context) into which we can divide the business process of, for example, an on-line shopping website. </s>

<s n="s4.4;p46.47">Such a process is beyond Semantic Analysis and, as such, the scope of this document, however it is important to be aware of tools such as UML for their usefulness in processing information gleaned through semantic and organisational analysis techniques. </s>

<p n="p47.47">
<s n="s1.3;p47.47">It is hoped that this document has provided, firstly, an explanation and justification for a need to analyse the social concerns in terms of business signs and communications when designing an E-Commerce system, and secondly, and overview and explanation of some of the techniques for determining requirements, discovering and representing business norms, and analysing structural considerations, and using this information to ensure that business processes are in alignment with the technology. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p47.47">One of the key themes this document attempts to stress is the use of technology as an enabler to support business functions - not for its own sake. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p47.47">The organisation that bears this in mind at all times and uses semiotics to build technology, where value can be added, around those social and communication structures can succeed in supplementing and enhancing their activities on-line. </s>
