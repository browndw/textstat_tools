<s n="s1.11;p2.34">It was J. J. </s>
<s n="s2.11;p2.34">Thomson who in 1897 refined Crooke's vacuum tube from twenty years earlier into the Cathode Ray Tube (CRT). </s>
<s n="s3.11;p2.34">The phenomenon of phosphorescence had been used solely as a method of detection of electron beams; but in 1931 the first CRT television sets were commercially available. </s>
<s n="s4.11;p2.34">These represented the first modern method of displaying moving images. </s>
<s n="s5.11;p2.34">Television sets produced today are based on the same principle. </s>
<s n="s6.11;p2.34">Electrons produced from a heated cathode filament by thermionic emission are accelerated through a vacuum tube towards the viewing end (anode). </s>
<s n="s7.11;p2.34">Electromagnets are used to deflect the beam to scan the surface at the viewing end which is coated with a phosphorescent material. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p2.34">Modern television sets use different materials which specifically emit red, green, and blue light, closely packed together in strips, and three electron guns which fire specifically at each type of phosphor. </s>
<s n="s9.11;p2.34">A shadow mask consisting of tiny holes in a metal plate prevent each gun hitting the wrong phosphor. </s>
<s n="s10.11;p2.34">Thus a raster scan of the entire front end of the set allows a full colour picture to be produced by modulating the intensity of the electron beam according to the video signal. </s>
<s n="s11.11;p2.34">Television sets made using this technology have been highly successful and only recently have other technologies been competing in the display market. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.34">
<s n="s1.4;p3.34">CRT displays have several disadvantages that are overcome in part by newer technologies. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p3.34">They are essentially bulky, heavy and large in size to accommodate the vacuum tube and electron gun and they operate traditionally on an analogue input signal. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p3.34">Any still image projected onto the screen for an extended period can be 'burnt' into the screen as certain clusters of phosphor are used more than others. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p3.34">Liquid Crystal Displays (LCDs) were the first to offer a solution to these problems providing a thin and lightweight alternative. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.34">
<s n="s1.11;p4.34">LCD technology took its greatest step forward in 1969 when J. Fergason presented an improved LCD which became the basis of modern displays of this type. </s>
<s n="s2.11;p4.34">Essentially it consisted of a light-polarising liquid crystal material trapped in cells between two transparent polarising sheets arranged perpendicularly to each other. </s>
<s n="s3.11;p4.34">In the relaxed state before an electric field is applied, incoming light is polarised by the first sheet which encourages the liquid crystal medium to polarise parallel to the light polarisation direction of the sheets. </s>
<s n="s4.11;p4.34">Between the sheets, the molecules twist naturally between the two perpendicular extremes. </s>
<s n="s5.11;p4.34">Light is polarised by one sheet, rotated through the smooth twisting of the crystal molecules, then passes through the second sheet. </s>
<s n="s6.11;p4.34">The assembly looks nearly transparent but some light is lost by the first polarisation sheet. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p4.34">On application of an electric field across a region of the cell, the molecules align themselves with the electric field thus inhibiting rotation of the polarised light. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p4.34">All light is absorbed and the cell appears black. </s>
<s n="s9.11;p4.34">A pair of thin layers of glass impregnated with Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) electrodes allow only certain segments of the cell to be affected by the electric field, producing the desired pattern on the display. </s>
<s n="s10.11;p4.34">A colour display can be made using an LCD pixel divided into three sections each with a different colour filter. </s>
<s n="s11.11;p4.34">Any colour can be produced by varying the relative brightness of the three coloured sections. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.34">
<s n="s1.10;p5.34">However there are limitations to this type of device. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p5.34">Small LCDs known as passive displays have one electrical contact per segment. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p5.34">As the size of the display increases, this becomes unwieldy and a passive matrix structure is adopted which uses one set of contacts per column or row of pixels. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p5.34">Only one pixel can be addressed at any one time, so the pixel must remember its state until it can be addressed again by the circuit. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p5.34">This makes the display of video material problematic as the display will respond badly to fast moving images. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p5.34">To solve this problem a matrix of Thin-Film Transistors (TFTs) are incorporated into the display which remember the electrical state of each pixel and maintain this until the pixel is re-addressed. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p5.34">This active matrix system allows video to be displayed with only little distortion. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p5.34">Now more commonly referred to as TFT displays, this technology is present in modern computer monitors and handheld television devices. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p5.34">The limitations of TFT displays are that of their narrow viewing angle, poor contrast and slow pixel response times. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p5.34">Research is underway into overcoming these problems - new liquid crystals and composites of liquid crystal elastomers and conductive polymers are being modelled and synthesised at the Liquid Crystal Institute<ref target="BAWE_0415d-endnote.001"/> in Ohio. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p6.34">Another limitation of LCD displays is that they require a backlight to allow the user to see the display. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p6.34">For small appliances this light, generally a cold cathode fluorescent lamp, tends to take up more than 60% of the battery power. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p6.34">This light is found along the side of the display and a light guide is used to spread the intensity uniformly over the display. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p6.34">A typical light guide is made from acrylic, with diffusing white dots on the bottom surface to help evenly distribute the light over the top of the display; a reflective sheet to avoid optical loss at the back of the display, and a diffusing sheet to eliminate the images of the diffusing dots. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p6.34">In short, a lot of light intensity is lost. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p6.34">A group at Keio University in Japan have been working on a highly efficient back-light guide that uses none of the above optical films but a series of microprisms at the bottom surface which reflect incident light to the top of the display with a high optical efficiency. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p6.34">They have demonstrated that spherical micron sized particles of (CH3SiO1.5)n in a poly(methylmethacrylate) matrix diffuse light effectively; and have optimised the microprism geometry by computer simulation to produce a guide that is more efficient than any other produced using standard technology<ref target="BAWE_0415d-endnote.002"/>. </s>

<s n="s1.8;p7.34">Plasma Display Panels (PDPs) solve some of the problems associated with LCDs and maintain some advantages over CRT technology. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p7.34">The display essentially consists of millions of small 'gas-discharge tubes' several millimetres in depth. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p7.34">Electrons are accelerated between electrodes in the discharge cell. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p7.34">Electrons of appropriate energy collide and excite inert gas molecules which decay back to their ground state releasing UV radiation. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p7.34">The UV photons stimulate phosphors at the front of the cell to emit visible light. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p7.34">For colour reproduction, a triad of plasma cells containing red, blue and green phosphors is used. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p7.34">In order to vary the light intensity of each colour cell and thus produce an arbitrary colour, the voltage across the colour cell is not changed but the length of time that the cell is on during one frame is altered. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p7.34">Since the eye response time is less than that of the television display frequency, it perceives different colours depending on how long each cell of the triad is on. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.34">
<s n="s1.5;p8.34">To allow fast moving video and high definition colour to be displayed UV radiation must be prevented from passing between cells and interacting with the wrong phosphor. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p8.34">A honeycomb structure of cells separated by barrier ribs is used minimise this problem. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p8.34">The switching of cells on and off efficiently and cheaply has only recently been possible due to the miniaturisation of electronics. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p8.34">The cells respond to the applied voltage within a millionth of a second which allows a passive matrix system to be used. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p8.34">Displays can thus be made up to 80 inches in diameter without any picture quality loss. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.34">
<s n="s1.5;p9.34">PDPs present the display market with a large, thin, high definition display which has a wide viewing angle thus overcomes one of the main drawbacks of TFT screens. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p9.34">However the drawbacks of PDPs must be addressed if they are to compete with new display technologies. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p9.34">They are relatively expensive to produce, hugely power consuming and have a limited lifetime. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p9.34">Research is underway at Fujitsu, Samsung and other manufacturers into increasing the energy efficiency of the displays and designing plasma cells which maintain emission intensity for longer<ref target="BAWE_0415d-endnote.003"/>.One example of the research carried out this year is the development of new methods for processing photosensitive films which are used to produce the electrodes and barrier ribs between the cells. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p9.34">The cells are produced by photolithography (figure 1) - a photosensitive paste is deposited on the backing substrate, a mask with the required pattern is held over the paste and on UV irradiation the masked areas polymerise setting solid and producing the barrier ribs. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p11.34">Another technology in which manufacturers are heavily investing research resources is that of Light Emitting Diode (LED) displays. </s>

<p n="p13.34">
<s n="s1.7;p13.34">Small molecule Organic Light Emitting Diodes (OLEDs) are efficient at generating light but harder to produce than Polymer LEDs (PLEDs), however PLEDs have traditionally been much less efficient in generating light. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p13.34">For inorganic LEDs, there is strong spin-orbit coupling and so intersystem crossing is very efficient and the emissive state has a high 'triplet state' content. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p13.34">For small molecule OLEDs and PLEDs, intersystem crossing is not so common, leading to the triplet:singlet ratio of excited states being held at 3:1 (This is due to there being three triplet states for each singlet state). </s>
