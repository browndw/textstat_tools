<s n="s1.8;p1.15">The term 'Romanticism' was not recognised as a distinct movement or object of study until the late nineteenth century. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p1.15">During this period there were a number of revolutions, political, cultural and literary. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p1.15">However, Blake, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron Shelley and Keats, often referred to as the 'big six' by no means regarded themselves as a unified group and were actually much divided in their political, religious and artistic beliefs. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p1.15">John Blades notes that whilst these recognisable figures of Romantic poetry were aware of each others' work, "they did not form a recognisable group with anything like a united artistic manifesto." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3006d-ftnote.001"/>
<s n="s5.8;p1.15">They did, however, share a strong opposition to the rigid and artificial diction of the Neo-Classical literary movement of the eighteenth century and strove to create poetry which would illustrate "a natural delineation of human passions, human characters and human incidents." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3006d-ftnote.002"/>
<s n="s6.8;p1.15">Politically, the Romantics were against authoritarian government and favoured democracy. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p1.15">They were also attracted to Rousseau and Godwin's campaigns in the cause of humanity. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p1.15">Emotionally, they expressed an extreme assertion of the self, the value of individual experience and the dynamic nature of the imagination. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p2.15">It is vital to reinforce that although the 'Romantic poets were united in their resistance' to eighteenth century literary culture, "it would be misleading to describe them as a combined 'school'"<ref target="BAWE_3006d-ftnote.003"/>. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p2.15">This 'pluralism' of ideals is one way in which the Romantic poets differed greatly from their predecessors of the Neo-Classical movement, whose united, rational ideals were in great contrast to those of the Romantic period. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p2.15">Where the Romantics considered it to be "the honourable characteristic of poetry that its materials are to be found in every subject which can interest the human mind"<ref target="BAWE_3006d-ftnote.004"/>, Neo-Classicism generalised about people and was inclined to assume that "all people were in essence uniform", thus disregarding the areas of human interest that were central to Romantic poetry. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p2.15">It 'diminished the importance of individual perception and expression, in exchange for conformity and mechanistic formalism. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p3.15">The way in the Romantic poets 'revolutionised' such rational and structured ideas is abundantly evident in William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge's <hi rend="italic">Lyrical Ballads</hi>, "arguably the most important single volume of the romantic period" which "signalled a literary revolution." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3006d-ftnote.005"/>
<s n="s2.5;p3.15">In his 'Advertisement' (1798) for the anthology, Wordsworth wrote of the poems: "They were written with a view to ascertain how far the language of conversation in the middle and lower classes of society is adapted to the purposes of poetic pleasure." </s>
<s n="s3.5;p3.15">Wordsworth and Coleridge did not use the format of the couplet which dominated eighteenth century poetry but wrote in quatrain, hymn - like ballad form, and experimented with other poetic structures. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p3.15">Furthermore, they wrote in simple verse which was in direct contrast to the popular periphrasis used extensively by eighteenth century poets such as Pope, Swift and Sheridan. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p3.15">In the <hi rend="italic">Preface</hi> Wordsworth contrasts these two types of language describing the latter as "arbitrary and capricious habits of expression....to furnish food for fickle tastes, and fickle appetites, of their own creation." </s>

<s n="s1.1;p4.15">These new modes of expression are directly linked to the Romantic revolution in aesthetic perspective and attitude towards previously ignored areas of "artistic interest, namely the imagination and intuition."<ref target="BAWE_3006d-ftnote.006"/> </s>

<s n="s1.3;p5.15">The 'revolutions' of the Romantic period are often viewed to have been partially inspired by the ideals of two key figures, the Swiss philosopher Jean-Jaques Rousseau and William Godwin, an English essayist and political idealist who shared many of Rousseau's ideas. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p5.15">John Blades argues that Rousseau was "<hi rend="italic">the</hi> seminar force in the revolution of thought that produced the Romantics." </s>

<s n="s1.5;p6.15">Although the Romantics were not revolutionary in their admiration of nature, the way in which they used it as a source of truth and inspiration within their poetry was indeed a literary revolution of the period. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p6.15">Prior to this period, Neo-Classicism wrote of nature as something mundane and almost lifeless. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p6.15">This movement remained rooted in Greek and Roman models of interpretation, and as a result, "the pastoral was a fairly conventional, flattened vision of bucolic life." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3006d-ftnote.008"/>
<s n="s4.5;p6.15">In contrast to this the romantics saw in nature a much greater power and were largely interested in the moral powers of nature and the way in which they could affect the human psyche and conscience. </s>

<s n="s1.1;p9.15">This relates to the way in which the Romantics regarded nature as "potentially the landscape of the mind itself; they believed that nature contained transcendent truths, which could condition the human mind in a way that the Urban or social environment of the period could not. </s>

<p n="p10.15">
<s n="s1.10;p10.15">The Romantics vision of nature was also revolutionary in the way in which it contradicted greatly the political and cultural revolutions for the period. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p10.15">For Wordsworth in particular, the industrial revolution, expansion of cities, and technological advances created a distinct feeling of 'alienation', whereby the individual became mechanised and distanced from aspects of 'natural' humanity. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p10.15">He observed the way in which time became disciplined and the way in which the division in labour within factories 'alienated' man from their craft. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p10.15">This is largely evident in Wordsworth's poem 'Composed Upon Westminster Bridge.' </s>
<s n="s5.10;p10.15">Wordsworth's poem has been described as "...a celebration of the wealth, power and beauty of London." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3006d-ftnote.010"/>
<s n="s6.10;p10.15">The grandiose language evokes what might be regarded as a pompous celebration of the power of the city, and in a sense suggests that what is in essemce 'artificial' is a pinnacle of human achievement. </s>
