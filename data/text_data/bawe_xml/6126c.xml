<p n="p1.12">
<s n="s1.4;p1.12">The study of Applied Linguistics aims to understand the use of language in the real world. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p1.12">By carrying out a multimodal analysis of an advertisement, I aim to discover the language techniques used to persuade viewers to buy a product. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p1.12">Secondly I will interview a number of people about a contested aspect of language. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p1.12">Both studies will attempt to provide important data about language use in society today. </s>

<head rend="underlined">Task One</head>
<p n="p2.12">
<s n="s1.4;p2.12">Multimodal texts combine many types of sign which work collectively to signify a concept. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p2.12">Television advertisements are examples of multimodal texts, which combine a 'syntagmatic sequence of imagines, sounds and words' (Jonathan Bignell 2002:28). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p2.12">By analysing the signs within the <hi rend="italic">Surfer</hi> advertisement for the alcoholic drinks company <hi rend="italic">Guinness</hi>, one can decipher how they work together and the meanings they aim to create. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p2.12">The advertisement has been represented in a table format (see Appendix One) to easily illustrate and compare the four sign systems used within it. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.12">
<s n="s1.10;p3.12">The sign system of verbal language is used throughout the advertisement in conjunction with visual and aural signs (see Appendix 1). </s>
<s n="s2.10;p3.12">A male voice begins by describing the actions of the surfer in the first scene, 'He waits' - this waiting is synonymous with waiting for a pint of <hi rend="italic">Guinness</hi> to settle before being ready to drink. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p3.12">The narrator then emphasises the sheer frustration of waiting by imitating a clock ticking, 'tick followed tock', thus creating the signified concept of anguish and waiting. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p3.12">The narrator then refers to <hi rend="italic">Ahab</hi>, a character from the book <hi rend="italic">Moby Dick</hi> by Herman Melville. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p3.12">This story appears to be unrelated to the surfers in the advertisement, but in fact they are linked by a common notion - waiting. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p3.12">'Ahab' waiting for the whale <hi rend="italic">Moby Dick</hi> is synonymous with the surfers waiting for the perfect wave. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p3.12">The narrator then says, 'And the fat drummer hit the beat with all his heart'. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p3.12">Simultaneously the aural sign of a drum beat increases its volume - creating connotations of an increased heartbeat as a result of the excitement. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p3.12">In turn this excitement is linked to the signified anticipation of drinking the <hi rend="italic">Guinness</hi>. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p3.12">The final statement by the narrator is, 'Here's to waiting', creating the signified concept that the wait is worthwhile. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.12">
<s n="s1.6;p4.12">The complete advertisement is in black and white: the signification is the two colours; the signified is <hi rend="italic">Guinness</hi> - a black and white drink. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p4.12">The advertisement uses the iconic images of four surfers and the electronic iconic images of horses jumping from the crest of the wave. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p4.12">Jonathan Bignell (2002:32) points out that 'signs in ads also have connotations, meanings which come from our culture'. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p4.12">Jumping horses are a metaphor for rolling waves, adding to the drama and excitement of the advertisement. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p4.12">After the wave, there are two 'still' shots of the triumphant surfer. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p4.12">The signification here is simply the surfer's satisfaction at riding the wave, but the signified is the celebration that the wait for the <hi rend="italic">Guinness</hi> to settle is over. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.12">
<s n="s1.6;p5.12">The only linguistic sign in this advertisement is the slogan for <hi rend="italic">Guinness</hi> - 'Good things come to those who...'. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p5.12">Although this sign is arbitrary, it works because it is used conjunctively with other types of sign. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p5.12">The narrator says, 'Here's to waiting', so the producers did not even need to finish the linguistic sign as the viewer already knows what is about to be said. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p5.12">Guy Cook (2001:103) confirms this, 'the denotation of a word is an analysis of its signified; its sense is its relation to other signs'. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p5.12">The suspense created by the unfinished sentence adds to the semantic field of waiting which runs throughout the advert. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p5.12">The words are above the iconic image of a pint of <hi rend="italic">Guinness</hi> settling - this is the 'super-sign' (Bignell, 2002) that 'holds up' the other signs in the advertisement. </s>

<head rend="underlined">Task Two</head>
<p n="p6.12">
<s n="s1.4;p6.12">Taboo language is an area that produces many strong opinions, and so carrying out interviews concerning the topic will provide an interesting set of data to analyse. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p6.12">According to Peter Trudgill (2000:18), taboo language is used to refer to taboo behaviour - 'forbidden, or regarded as immoral or improper'. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p6.12">The interviewees are: a twenty year old female 'A' (see Appendix Two); a twenty year old male 'B'; and a forty-five year old female 'C'. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p6.12">I chose these people in order to investigate the differences or similarities in opinions which may be caused by gender, and also age. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.12">
<s n="s1.4;p7.12">Interviewees A and B both admitted to using taboo language in the form of swearing in their daily speech, with B declaring that it is 'alright in society today'. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p7.12">C (the eldest out of the three interviewees), regarded the use of taboo language as unnecessary and offensive. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p7.12">The two females (A and C) agreed that the aggression behind the spoken word is worse that the sound of the word itself. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p7.12">B differed here, stating that his use of taboo language is, 'for humour' rather than anger. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.12">
<s n="s1.6;p8.12">When discussing the situations where using taboo language in the form of swearing is acceptable, there were many similarities with the interviewees' answers. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p8.12">They agreed that it is inappropriate in any formal situation, with interviewees B and C specifically stating a job interview. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p8.12">Interviewee B decided that using it does not help to present himself, 'in the best possible way'. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p8.12">When describing the people they would or would not use taboo words in front of - they all confirmed that they would avoid it in front of relatives and children. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p8.12">Interviewees A and B, both aged twenty, said that they use taboo language where their conversation partner has already done so, A doing this with figures of authority such as lecturers and teachers and B with his older sister. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p8.12">Interviewees B and C avoid taboo language around people they do not know, as not to unknowingly offend. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.12">
<s n="s1.4;p9.12">All three interviewees made reference to the taboo word <hi rend="italic">cunt</hi>, both to its severity and inappropriateness in daily speech. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p9.12">Interviewee C could only describe it using its initial consonant, 'the c-word'. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p9.12">C also found the word fuck to be unacceptable, whereas B, the twenty year old male, uses it regularly in front of friends. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p9.12">The interviewees agreed that taboo words concerning sex and genitals were distasteful, and ones that describe faeces, i.e. 'crap' and 'poo' were softer; with A arguing that she does not even considered them taboo. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.12">
<s n="s1.5;p10.12">When asked to recall a situation where the use of taboo language has shocked them, the interviewees all expressed annoyance at the level of swearing used in front of children: whether by the parent; or by other children. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p10.12">Interviewee B added that elderly people using strong language was shocking, and unexpected. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p10.12">The shock felt here is explained by Janet Holmes (2001:206) as she states 'people [...] tend to use more vernacular forms as they get older', and so it would be unusual to hear older people swearing. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p10.12">A and B (the younger of the interviewees) agreed that they associate taboo language with speakers from the lower class, particularly males. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p10.12">C held opposing views here, stating that the upper classes seem to use it too, with women using the same amount of taboo language as men. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.12">
<s n="s1.4;p11.12">In conclusion, both the analysis of the multimodal text and the analysis of the interview results produced a number of interesting points about language use. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p11.12">The makers of the <hi rend="italic">Guinness</hi> combined many different types of visual signs and denotations: verbal; visual; aural; and linguistic in order to create a range of connotations. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p11.12">These were ideas of waiting and anticipation, frustration, determination and finally celebration. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p11.12">It became clear in the analysis that one sign can not be analysed without discussing another - they are intrinsically linked to create the desired effect: the viewer will believe that the emotions of the surfers will be recreated within themselves by waiting to drink a pint of <hi rend="italic">Guinness</hi>, and so they will feel the need to buy the product. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.12">
<s n="s1.5;p12.12">The interviews that were carried out to understand opinions about taboo language resulted in a diverse range of results. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p12.12">The two interviewees who were the same age (twenty years) agreed on many aspects of the subject, for example they both use taboo language frequently whereas the older interviewee (forty-five years) did not. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p12.12">Both females agreed on certain aspects that the male did not, such as the aggressiveness behind swearing. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p12.12">There were however many notions that all three interviewees agreed on. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p12.12">This study could have been improved by interviewing more people to create a larger and more accurate range of results in order to further understand how language is really used and speakers' attitudes towards it. </s>
