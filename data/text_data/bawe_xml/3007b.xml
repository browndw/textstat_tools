<s n="s1.10;p1.12">The term 'meaning' cannot clearly be defined, because, as Joseph Devito explains, it is something that is 'in people' not 'in words'. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p1.12">However, that is not to say that text is inert, that it is incapable of providing a means from which to create a sense of meaning within an individual. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p1.12">By allowing a fictitious environment to inhabit our realm of conscious thought, we are able to comprehend a perspective and sense of reality outside of our own. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p1.12">Therefore it can be seen that an individual's engagement with a text can be more of a subjective experience than an objective one. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p1.12">It is not possible to understand another individual if one cannot at the same time identify oneself with them. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p1.12">If a reader associates their self with a character in a work of fiction whom it is believed the messages or ideas of the text are being conveyed to, they in return may use the insight gained from the text to put into perspective their own personal context, hence a story is developed far beyond what is merely implied in the text. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p1.12">This story is always different because the context that surrounds an individual is always dynamic, active and as Mercer (2000:21) mentions 'created anew in every interaction between speaker and listener'<ref target="BAWE_3007b-ftnote.005"/>. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p1.12">Devito (2003:114) explains that 'as you change, you also change the meanings you created out of past messages'<ref target="BAWE_3007b-ftnote.006"/>. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p1.12">What can be learnt from this statement is that meaning is always in a process of evolvement, continually transforming and therefore is a concept that is always in the process of being understood. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p1.12">This essay will examine the ways in which meaning is mediated through discursive dialogues in Joseph Conrad's <hi rend="italic">Heart of Darkness</hi>, and directors Andy and Larry Wachowski's 1999 movie <hi rend="italic">The Matrix</hi>. </s>

<s n="s3.4;p2.12">One method of achieving this is through using the text to provoke a response in the reader. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p2.12">An example of this is seen in the following passage from <hi rend="italic">Heart of Darkness</hi>, where the story's protagonist, Marlow, explains to his listeners of the feelings that were incurred by the sounds he heard as he ascended upstream into the Congo: </s>

<s n="s1.16;p3.12">What is immediately apparent in this passage is the direct address that Marlow makes to his audience with the repetition of the word 'you'. </s>
<s n="s2.16;p3.12">In the story, the 'you' refers to the people aboard a ship that are listening to Marlow recount a voyage undertaken in his younger days. </s>
<s n="s3.16;p3.12">But it can also be seen as a direct address to the reader. </s>
<s n="s4.16;p3.12">Taking this into consideration, we find that the text has an active role. </s>
<s n="s5.16;p3.12">The first theorist to explore the field of pragmatics, J.L Austin, distinguished between two different types of utterance, namely that of <hi rend="italic">constatives</hi>, which are descriptive statements, and <hi rend="italic">performatives</hi>, which are utterances that perform actions. </s>
<s n="s6.16;p3.12">Hence, if the reader takes the utterance 'you' to be referring to them, the text is <hi rend="italic">performative</hi>, it is performing an action in that it is having an active affect on the reader, who would consider not the contextual situation of the fictional narrator, but their own personal life. </s>
<s n="s7.16;p3.12">I.A. Richards (1929:525) points out that 'the personal situation of the reader inevitably (and within limits rightly) affects his reading'<ref target="BAWE_3007b-ftnote.008"/>. </s>
<s n="s8.16;p3.12">For the reader to interpret their own sense of meaning from this passage they would focus on the indirect and symbolic form of the description given, because they would not be able to experience the sounds of the Congo from the text alone. </s>
<s n="s9.16;p3.12">Barron (2002: 13) states that indirect speech acts occur where the speaker 'means more than what he says'<ref target="BAWE_3007b-ftnote.009"/>, and this is evident in the line ' - you so remote from the night of first ages, could comprehend'. </s>
<s n="s10.16;p3.12">This appears to be use of indirect speech because of the vague description 'night of the first ages'. </s>
<s n="s11.16;p3.12">In the story it might imply that Marlow's audience are literally far away from the Congo of Africa, but taken as an abstract address to the reader, one may consider that they we as civilised human beings are widely separated from the feelings and emotions felt in a primitive state. </s>
<s n="s12.16;p3.12">Mercer (2001:21) states that conversations are 'not necessarily made up of physical objects and events around the speaker'<ref target="BAWE_3007b-ftnote.010"/>. </s>
<s n="s13.16;p3.12">The implications Mercer's statement conveys the notion that readers do not have to relate their own sense of meaning to a literal description in the text. </s>
<s n="s14.16;p3.12">They need not even equate meaning to any ideas or messages Conrad could have originally intended to convey. </s>
<s n="s15.16;p3.12">What is important in order for the text to stimulate any kind of response in the reader is that it merely presents an environment, event or perspective to which the reader can reflect their own experience and point of view against. </s>
<s n="s16.16;p3.12">In this sense, the author's text is made irrelevant to the process of meaning making. </s>

<s n="s1.11;p5.12">This passage parallels the last one since the viewer is directly addressed with indirect forms of language. </s>
<s n="s2.11;p5.12">Again the use of 'you' as an address is present, with the vague descriptive language provoking in the viewer a sense of abstract meaning that could readily be applied to their individual life. </s>
<s n="s3.11;p5.12">In the movie, Morpheus is literally referring to the fact that Neo's sense of reality is actually an illusion perpetuated a computer generated reality known as 'The Matrix', which is what is 'wrong with the world'. </s>
<s n="s4.11;p5.12">However, because the viewer is seemingly directly addressed, a symbolic reading inevitably ensues, leading the viewer to question their own sense of reality. </s>
<s n="s5.11;p5.12">Just as <hi rend="italic">Heart of Darkness</hi> could invoke uneasy sensations in the reader about their natural emotions being repressed by civilisation, so to can Morpheus's dialogue be seen to provoke the same sense of discomfort in the viewer in regards to their accustomed perception of the world. </s>
<s n="s6.11;p5.12">To put this into perspective, post-Jungian Christopher Hauke (2000:202) explains that 'we do not live in a world of 'presentations' but one of re-presentations that are further re-presented in linguistic forms; we are doubly alienated from experience'<ref target="BAWE_3007b-ftnote.012"/>. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p5.12">Within the context of the movie, Neo is shown that a computer program constructs the world that he believes to be living in, and the real world is actually many years into the future. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p5.12">What this can implicitly invoke in the reader is a sense that technology and civilisation have replaced the natural environment, which in turn seem so commonplace that the urban landscape itself feels like a natural environment. </s>
<s n="s9.11;p5.12">This can also provoke the viewer into questioning their previous natural adaptation to the current urban environment, which as Morpheus states 'You felt it your entire life'. </s>
<s n="s10.11;p5.12">The viewer could therefore examine this 'feeling', or previous perception of reality, by reconsidering the ways in which certain objects can have specific meanings attached to them because of what they subjectively represent and unconsciously evoke feelings of. </s>
<s n="s11.11;p5.12">In this way, the viewer's 'splinter' can be removed and their meanings given to objects and feelings can be revaluated. </s>

<s n="s3.5;p6.12">Both <hi rend="italic">Heart of Darkness</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Matrix</hi> focus on journeys, where the reader may, if viewed within a symbolic context, discover truths about themselves. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p6.12">To do this, a text needs to make the reader aware that just as the world as they experience it is only a product of individual interpretation, so may the concept of the self. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p6.12">The Matrix explains this by way of psychic representation in the scene where Neo meets a character named 'the Oracle': </s>

<quote lang="English">'Morpheus believes in you Neo. And no one, not you, not even me can convince him otherwise. He believes it so blindly, that he's going to sacrifice his life to save yours'</quote>

<s n="s1.18;p7.12">Morpheus, in Greek mythology, is the god of dreams. </s>
<s n="s2.18;p7.12">An oracle is one who can divine the future, and the rearranging of the word 'Neo' can spell 'one'. </s>
<s n="s3.18;p7.12">Therefore the viewer can assume that the Oracle is addressing them when she says 'Neo', but what she is addressing is less clear. </s>
<s n="s4.18;p7.12">If the many characters Neo is helped by along his journey are constructs of the psyche, then it is possible that they represent aspects of the self. </s>
<s n="s5.18;p7.12">It is likely that Morpheus represents faith, which is a quality associated with dreams in the emotional sense of the word. </s>
<s n="s6.18;p7.12">Hauke (2000:133) states that the other within each individual represents 'lost parts of the personality felt to be foreign and other to the ego but which are calling for inclusion and to be in dialogue with the ego'<ref target="BAWE_3007b-ftnote.013"/>. </s>
<s n="s7.18;p7.12">The effect that this would have when comprehended by the viewer is that they question the earthly values that they possess, such as faith and love, to see how much of these natural qualities have been retained in their ego, or whether they have been repressed into their unconscious. </s>
<s n="s8.18;p7.12">Lane, Mengham and Tew (2003:3) state that 'the construction of civic identity involves the repression of certain aspects of the self'<ref target="BAWE_3007b-ftnote.014"/>. </s>
<s n="s9.18;p7.12">This view implies that it is civilization that causes this fragmented sense of self, which an individual can only recover through knowing what parts of the self have been lost. </s>
<s n="s10.18;p7.12">What this sense of incompleteness in the viewer can reveal about the meaning of the self can be explained in religious terms. </s>
<s n="s11.18;p7.12">Because all religions are generally based on the same basic principles, that of seeking certain truths about oneself and the world around us, it is possible that a religious reading of this passage can reveal meaning about the self. </s>
<s n="s12.18;p7.12">The oracle mentions that Morpheus will 'sacrifice his life to save yours'. </s>
<s n="s13.18;p7.12">In many religions, sacrifices, human or other, are often offered to Gods as a form of praise and worship. </s>
<s n="s14.18;p7.12">Grotstein (1998:64) believes that 'the search for God is but another way - in part, albeit - to search for his/her own Unconscious'<ref target="BAWE_3007b-ftnote.015"/>. </s>
<s n="s15.18;p7.12">This would imply, in the post-Lacan sense that the continual search for meaning, which many groups of people have projected into the idolisation of a form of deity, is merely a sense of something missing that can be rediscovered. </s>
<s n="s16.18;p7.12">What this can induce in the viewer is the idea that they should release the natural emotions within themselves that have been repressed by society and embrace feelings toward an unconscious mode of being in order to regain a sense of self. </s>
<s n="s17.18;p7.12">Therefore any projections of their own psyche, which may have enveloped a sense of meaning, can be eradicated, so that a state of association with all the previously repressed emotions is experienced and any previous sense of meaning is merely immaterial in light of a fresh outlook. </s>

<s n="s7.7;p8.12">The religious analogy imploring the reader to comprehend a sense of self that is separate from the ego seems like the obvious strategy of this passage, but the abstract language leaves the reader free to create their own meanings from the text, which is there merely to incite such thoughts and creative responses. </s>

<s n="s4.6;p10.12">This is a similar situation to the reader's one since this passage is attempting to explain that it can only shed so much light on the truths represented by the text because the reader, with their own evolving context, must discover truths independently. </s>
