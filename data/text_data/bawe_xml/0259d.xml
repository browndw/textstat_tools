<s n="s1.5;p1.23">Of all the ideas most often celebrated as Nietzschean in origin, there are perhaps none that receive as little explicit discussion as does the idea of perspectivism. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p1.23">In fact, as a singular position put forth to capture various attitudes regarding knowledge and morality, perspectivism is thematized only once in his completed works, and twice in the posthumous notes published under the title <hi rend="italic">The Will to Power</hi>.<ref target="BAWE_0259d-ftnote.001"/> Despite the scant mention of the position itself, the idea of perspectivism is really a very central notion in Nietzsche's thought. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p1.23">Indeed, the fact that the position itself is so seldom the subject of discussion is, paradoxically, <hi rend="italic">an expression of its importance</hi>. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p1.23">In what follows we will see how support of perspectivism necessarily complicates the mode in which it is presented. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p1.23">I will then argue that Nietzsche's method of inquiry, as well as the various styles he employs as an author, are in direct response to these complications. </s>

<s n="s1.8;p2.23">Generally, perspectivism is the view that one's values, goals, bias, interpretations, or <hi rend="italic">perspective</hi> are all necessary for, rather than impediments to, knowledge. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p2.23">In maintaining this, Nietzsche stands opposed to all those philosophers whose theory of knowledge holds up disinterested and value-free as true knowledge's chief virtues. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p2.23">For him, the intellect is not an impersonal faculty that seeks out those truths that exist independently of the knower, but is tied intimately to the drives, needs, and instincts of the human animal. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p2.23">The intellect is put into action in service of the desires of the dominant will of its owner - what Nietzsche calls their <hi rend="italic">will to power</hi>.<ref target="BAWE_0259d-ftnote.002"/> Thus what the intellect conceives is never an independent thing 'the way it is in itself', but rather something that is essentially related to the will, an expression of a particular perspective. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p2.23">As he writes, "this necessary perspectivism by virtue of which every center of force - and not only man - construes all the rest of the world from its own viewpoint, i.e., measures, feels, forms, according to its own force".<ref target="BAWE_0259d-ftnote.003"/> The important point here is that Nietzsche is not only claiming perspective to be a powerful force in personalizing the knowledge which each acquires, as though before the application of such a perspective the thing known <hi rend="italic">does</hi> have a way of existing 'in itself', as though perspective was most accurately thought of as a measure of distortion. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p2.23">Perspective does not simply re-orientate already perceived moments into a more satisfying way of seeing; it is perspective which constitutes the very act of perception itself. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p2.23">In other words, to perceive is necessarily to perceive <hi rend="italic">as</hi> something; to know is necessarily to know <hi rend="italic">as</hi> something, where this 'as' points to that thing's relation to the will. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p2.23">Thus there is no pure perception or knowledge, as the very condition for any knowledge is that it bears some relation to some will's ends - knowledge is essentially <hi rend="italic">interested</hi>.<ref target="BAWE_0259d-ftnote.004"/> The 'apparent' world, informed by perspective, is not a distortion of the world 'in itself' for this latter world simply <hi rend="italic">is not</hi>: </s>

<s n="s1.14;p4.23">However, perspectivism generates for Nietzsche two paradoxes. </s>
<s n="s2.14;p4.23">First, Nietzsche's works contain many different but related views and concepts, perspectivism being one of them. </s>
<s n="s3.14;p4.23">It only makes sense to assume that he presents such views as the eternal return, the will to power, or the corruption of Christianity in some degree of seriousness. </s>
<s n="s4.14;p4.23">That is to say, Nietzsche must write what he does because he thinks that his views are (to use an equivocal and volatile word), true. </s>
<s n="s5.14;p4.23">Not only that, but the fact <hi rend="italic">that he writes at all</hi> would seem to suggest that the dissemination of his views, thereby taking on the role of teacher, is part of his goal. </s>
<s n="s6.14;p4.23">The question that must be asked in light of this is the following: if Nietzsche does take his own views to be true, then how is this consistent with his perspectivism? </s>
<s n="s7.14;p4.23">If every view is only an interpretation, then must this not apply to his views as well? </s>
<s n="s8.14;p4.23">Does he not thereby effectively undermine his authority as a physician of culture? </s>
<s n="s9.14;p4.23">If, on the contrary, he does not take his views to be true, then we are faced with a more perplexing question: why did he bother to write at all? </s>
<s n="s10.14;p4.23">While this paradox arises out of the recognition that the tenet of perspectivism ought to apply to the writer espousing it, the second paradox focuses on the result of perspectivism turning on itself as a doctrine. </s>
<s n="s11.14;p4.23">The problem is straightforward: if perspectivism is correct, then every view is indeed an interpretation, since disinterested objective truths are a fiction. </s>
<s n="s12.14;p4.23">If every view is an interpretation, then perspectivism <hi rend="italic">itself</hi> is an interpretation, meaning that it stands alongside many other possible and diverse interpretations. </s>
<s n="s13.14;p4.23">Thus, perspectivism is possibly incorrect, and every view is perhaps not an interpretation. </s>
<s n="s14.14;p4.23">The position would seem to undermine itself. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.23">
<s n="s1.4;p5.23">I do not think it is immediately obvious which of these two problems it is more important to address, if in fact they are not equally important. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p5.23">One could argue in favour of the former by insisting that rigorous logical consistency, such as that which is the subject of the second paradox, is not a law which Nietzsche obeyed, nor had any respect for. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p5.23">Thus the more practical issue of his role as a teacher that teaches every truth is only <hi rend="italic">my</hi> truth takes precedence. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p5.23">However, although Nietzsche did criticize aspects of logic, this cannot be read as an attack on rigour and precision; both remained for him essential: </s>
</p>
<quote lang="English">[...] let us hope the long interval has done [these ideas] good, that they have become riper, clearer, stronger, more perfect! <hi rend="italic">That</hi> I still cleave to them today, however, that they have become in the meantime more and more firmly attached to one another, indeed entertwined and interlaced with one another, strengthens my joyful assurance that they might have arisen in me from the first root not as isolated, capricious, or sporadic things but from a common root, from a <hi rend="italic">fundamental will</hi> of knowledge, pointing imperiously into the depths, speaking more and more precisely, demanding greater and greater precision. <ref target="BAWE_0259d-ftnote.007"/>

<s n="s1.4;p6.23">On the contrary, one could argue for the latter by insisting that whatever Nietzsche's opinions on logic, he ought to be subjected to contemporary standards nonetheless, as his relation to his audience in light of perspectivism will become a trivial matter if in fact perspectivism is shown to be a self-refuting idea. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p6.23">If perspectivism refutes itself in the vacuum of the logical realm, then any dissemination of such a view must too be inherently contradictory. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p6.23">Although I do not deny the importance of the logical consistency problem on its own,<ref target="BAWE_0259d-ftnote.008"/> I do think that there are more interesting insights to be gained by considering the problem of Nietzsche's authorial credibility. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p6.23">Taking our cue from perspectivism's focus on the personal, let us examine how this paradox fits into the constellation of the author-as-perspectivist, and how Nietzsche himself interprets the problem within the writing where it occurs. </s>

<s n="s3.5;p8.23">But the immediate relevance for our examination is that it is precisely this 'courage of conscience' that is the focus of our problem. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p8.23">If, as seems to be the case in the above quote, Nietzsche encouraged his perspectivism to apply to his own position as the author, how does he respond to the obvious inconsistency it presents? </s>
<s n="s5.5;p8.23">We now turn to an analysis of that response. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.23">
<s n="s1.7;p9.23">The problem that persists, of course, is how can Nietzsche recommend an attitude of perspectivism while embracing that attitude himself? </s>
<s n="s2.7;p9.23">While attempting to present his views as explicitly <hi rend="italic">his own</hi>, and suitable only for him or perhaps those who share a similar will to knowledge, he always runs the risk of seeming, like the philosophical tradition he so wants to distance himself from, as though what he presents are not <hi rend="italic">his</hi> views but ones that have some claim to rational or unconditional authority. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p9.23">By discussing this problem directly <hi rend="italic">in</hi> his works however, by going far enough to convince his readers again and again that all of it is no more than <hi rend="italic">his</hi> opinion, he would effectively remove himself from the philosophical canon altogether, thereby ceasing to have any effect on an important sphere of audience. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p9.23">No, Nietzsche's rather original approach to the problem avoids this unattractive option. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p9.23">Rather than addressing the issue <hi rend="italic">in</hi> the content of his works, he addresses it <hi rend="italic">via</hi> the form. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p9.23">First, we will see how Nietzsche's execution of his <hi rend="italic">Genealogy of Morals</hi> not only reveals the interpretations that are intimately involved in moral 'truths', but also, through his style, is able to draw attention to and undermine his own authority as the genealogist. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p9.23">Second, by taking note of the pluralism Nietzsche exhibits in the style of his presentation and the rhetorical tropes he employs, we will see how he creates for himself an unforgettably <hi rend="italic">personal</hi> presence in his works, thereby conveying how necessarily individual are their contents. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.23">
<s n="s1.6;p10.23">In the preface and three essays that comprise his <hi rend="italic">On the Genealogy of Morals</hi>, Nietzsche presents an account of the origin of the accepted moral standards that exist today, revealing the values, desires, and beliefs which were responsible for generating such standards. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p10.23">By using genealogy as his method, he uncovers the line of descent extending from 'ancestral' psychological states to the current system of morality. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p10.23">In this way, Nietzsche seeks not so much to examine the veracity of a moral truth to which society holds fast, but rather undertakes a project to expose the will that led to such a moral 'truth'. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p10.23">The focus is less on a logical analysis of the content of the ideas and more on uncovering the motivation behind those who espouse such ideas. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p10.23">This is not to say that arguments against the idea itself are not offered - for these are not omitted - but rather that the perspective from which such 'truth' springs is for him a more fundamental inquiry. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p10.23">For this perspective that he is so eager to bring to the surface comes logically and temporally in advance of the established 'truth'; thus the analysis that asks after motivation is one that is able to go deeper. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.23">
<s n="s1.9;p11.23">With his target set as Christian morality, he provides an account of how the current virtues of meekness, humility, justice, and forgiveness, all elements of what Nietzsche deems the slave morality, came to be known as the values which one ought to prize as good. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p11.23">In uncovering the etymological roots of the word 'good', he finds an opposing conception of morality than the one that persists now. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p11.23">'Good', he argues, used to be a measure of status or hierarchical position. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p11.23">In ancient times, it was the warrior, the nobleman, and the aristocrat that embodied the standard of what was good. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p11.23">Character traits such as power, health, pride, boldness, naiveté, and freedom - these were the qualities of the original moral man. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p11.23">The morality of today, however, was generated by the slaves, or the ones who were physically weak and subservient to the great noblemen. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p11.23">Inspired by the resentment they feel by being oppressed by the strong, the creative deed of the slave is to affirm himself by taking an imaginary revenge; the clever slave devalues the values held by oppressors and making what opposes it what is valuable. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p11.23">This hostile reaction rejects the values of the noblemen, characterizing them as evil qualities, while championing their impotence as meekness, their desire for revenge as justice, and their incapacity for revenge as humility. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p11.23">Driven by his hatred for his master, he negates the master's values and creates a morality for which it is good to be weak, so that he thereby can be on one level victorious against the master. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.23">
<s n="s1.5;p12.23">These values, rooted in reaction and resentment, are what Nietzsche argues to be the same that persist in Christian morality today. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p12.23">And, because it can only be made sense of in terms of <hi rend="italic">reaction</hi>, its origin is not left behind but remains relevant, remains intrinsic to it, and can thereby be used in order to evaluate its validity. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p12.23">What Nietzsche aims to make clear is that Christian morality arises not from love and forgiveness, but guilt and resentment. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p12.23">What is also made clear, through the method of genealogy itself, is that even perhaps our most tacitly accepted 'truths' are far from objective or unconditional, and are instead always informed by certain motivations, by a certain <hi rend="italic">perspective</hi>. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p12.23">In addition, those hidden motivations are inextricably tied to what they produce, and are therefore relevant when it comes to evaluating or providing a critique of current 'truths'. </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.23">
<s n="s1.6;p13.23">However, while genealogy as a method of inquiry animates the very idea of perspectivism, while it reveals the interpretation behind the idea, it is at the same time an exercise in interpretation and evaluation itself. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p13.23">For of course the account provided by Nietzsche of the roots of Christian morality is not the presentation of an unconditional fact (as he opposes the very idea of such facts), but is <hi rend="italic">his</hi> interpretation. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p13.23">The account must be irreducibly personal, as his preferences are put to use: "to interpret as a psychologist is to evaluate, according to its strength or weakness, the quality of the will required by an ideal, a belief, a conviction, a behaviour, or an institution".<ref target="BAWE_0259d-ftnote.011"/> As we saw above, self-deception is something Nietzsche detests. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p13.23">It is in this spirit that he writes, "the lawgiver eventually receives the call: <hi rend="italic">patere legem, quam iqse tullisti</hi> [submit to the law you yourself proposed]".<ref target="BAWE_0259d-ftnote.012"/> Must not we then ask why ought we accept this genealogical account? </s>
<s n="s5.6;p13.23">Is it not the manifestation of one more partial and arbitrary point of view? </s>
<s n="s6.6;p13.23">Just as he criticizes those "English psychologists" for confusing their morality with morality itself, we must ask whether Nietzsche makes a similar mistake by confusing his truth with truth itself. </s>

<s n="s3.10;p18.23">One might suggest that the variation is representative of Nietzsche's persistent efforts to find the best means with which to express his ideas. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p18.23">On such a reading, his transition from one style to another would be the expression of the previous style's inadequacy, which is then also abandoned as he is driven on to the next stylistic 'experiment'. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p18.23">Instead of being unified by an overarching pluralistic strategy, what would unify his 'attempts' would be a persistent striving to express his ideas through means that would not trap him in the philosophical tradition that he criticizes and is at pains to distinguish himself from. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p18.23">However, such an explanation cannot be correct. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p18.23">To assume that, for Nietzsche, there <hi rend="italic">ever could be</hi> such thing as the perfect means of expression, the one that finally gets to the 'thing in itself' (i.e. </s>

<s n="s9.10;p18.23">If a stylistic change did in fact point to inadequacy, then we would have to accept that Nietzsche returned to a style he had already decided to be inappropriate. </s>
