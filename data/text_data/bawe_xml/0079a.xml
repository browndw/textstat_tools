<head>Abstract</head>
<p>In this paper are revised some of the causes and economic policies involved in the resolution of recent banking crises to set the ground for the analysis of the Argentine banking crisis during 2001-2. This experience is extensively addressed to shed light on their causes and to determine a set of policy recommendations which may help in improving the current situation. There are two main conclusions in this paper: (i) in the Argentine case the reduction in the amount of credit to the private sector has continued even though the economy has shown an upward trend in the real GDP. I called such a situation financial hysteresis and I suggested as an explanation that during the banking crisis the private sector swapped its sources of funding from formal to informal, and that nowadays this sector probably faces adverse incentives in returning to banks mainly due to confidence problems and (ii) when comparing the cases of Argentina, Indonesia and Mexico, it was observed that the ratio of credit to the private sector / GDP does not return to the pre-crisis level, even after many periods of sustained economic growth. However, when a Granger causality test is performed the evidence indicates that real GDP granger causes real credit to the private sector in the cases of Argentina and Mexico. Finally, a policy guideline for the Argentine banking system is outlined with emphasis on limiting the foreign-currency denomination of assets and liabilities in the system as well as the credit to the public sector in order to avoid further collapses.</p>

<head>Introduction</head>
<p n="p1.110">
<s n="s1.3;p1.110">The analysis of recent banking crises is one of the most interesting fields in international financial macroeconomics due to their negative effects and recurrence, and the difficulties involved in their resolution. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p1.110">Diaz Alejandro (1985), when referring to the financial liberalisation processes started in the 1970s, anticipated many of these events with the catchy title "Good-bye financial repression, hello financial crash." </s>
<s n="s3.3;p1.110">Furthermore, during a new wave of financial liberalisation initiated in the 1990s, banking crises have shown more adverse effects when compared with the 1980s <hi rend="sup">1</hi>. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.110">
<s n="s1.3;p2.110">In this context of endemic banking crises a number of interesting questions have been raised among policymakers and academics: What are the causes of such crises? </s>
<s n="s2.3;p2.110">Which policies should be pursued when a crisis arises? </s>
<s n="s3.3;p2.110">How can another collapse be prevented once the crisis vanishes? </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.110">
<s n="s1.2;p3.110">The Argentine 2001-2 financial turmoil revitalised these questions, exposing new issues due to the severity and extension of the distress, as the Argentine real GDP plummeted around 11% in 2002 while credit to the private sector suffered a 39.2% reduction in real terms (Dec-2002/Dec-2001). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p3.110">Now the GDP has recovered at an unexpectedly high rate of 8% in 2003 while the stock of credit to the private sector fell 18.3% (Dec-2003/Dec-2002) without clear signals of recovery in early 2004. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.110">
<s n="s1.4;p4.110">The objective of this paper is to deal with the aforementioned questions to shed light to the analysis of modern banking crisis, focusing on the Argentine experience. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p4.110">With this purpose I will first summarise a number of stylised facts on the causes and resolutions of recent banking crises. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p4.110">With the ground set for the analysis of the Argentine case, I will address in detail the characteristics of the Argentine banking system (henceforth BS) before and after the threshold generated by the devaluation in January 2002, including a brief comparison with the experiences of Mexico and Indonesia. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p4.110">The final step is to outline a number of policy recommendations to improve the situation of the Argentine BS. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.110">
<s n="s1.3;p5.110">There are two main conclusions in this paper. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p5.110">First, that in the Argentine case credit to the private sector has shown a negative trend even after a pronounced upward trend in the real GDP, yielding what I have called financial hysteresis. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p5.110">Second, that for Argentina and Mexico there is evidence that the GDP Granger causes credit to the private sector, albeit the relative importance of the latter does not return to the pre-crisis level. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.110">
<s n="s1.6;p6.110">The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p6.110">Section I addresses some stylized facts on the causes and resolution of recent banking crises. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p6.110">Section II introduces the Argentine experience. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p6.110">Section III compares the cases of Argentina, Indonesia and Mexico. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p6.110">Section IV briefly assesses policy recommendations for the Argentine case. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p6.110">Section V presents concluding remarks. </s>

<head>I. Banking crises in the 1980s and 1990s: causes and resolution</head>
<div2>
<head>A. Macroeconomic vulnerabilities</head>
<div3>
<head rend="bold">A-1. Real exchange rate appreciation</head>
<p n="p7.110">
<s n="s1.3;p7.110">There is evidence that countries affected by banking crises have shown an appreciated real exchange rate relative to its average level (Kaminsky and Reinhart 1999, p. 485). </s>
<s n="s2.3;p7.110">This appreciation is often due to the upward trend in consumption and investment when agents face optimistic expectations about the economy, for instance after a process of economic liberalisation <hi rend="sup">2</hi>. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p7.110">In such a situation, the profits of the tradable sector decrease, negatively affecting the quality of banking assets since some borrowers may face strong difficulties in performing their loans (Goldstein and Turner 1996, p. 12). </s>
</p>
</div3>
<div3>
<head rend="bold">A-2. Boom in domestic credit</head>
<p n="p8.110">
<s n="s1.1;p8.110">In almost all the recent experiences a credit lending boom has precluded the banking </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.110">
<s n="s1.3;p9.110">crises (Kaminsky and Reinhart 1999, pp. 483-4). </s>
<s n="s2.3;p9.110">There are different ways in which this mechanism affects BS vulnerability: (i) in the phase of expansion of the economic activity and the lending boom it may be difficult to differentiate between good and bad borrowers (Goldstein and Turner 1996, p. 14); (ii) banks may be more lax in measuring risk in a prosperous economic situation (op cit., p. 14) and (iii) there may exist a 'bubble' in the value of firms' collaterals. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p9.110">In this context when a shock arises (e.g., a sudden stop in external funding) negatively affecting the economy, the value of the collaterals in the BS may suffer a breakdown, thus affecting the system as a whole. </s>
</p>
</div3>
</div2>
<div2>
<head>B. Institutional vulnerabilities</head>
<p n="p10.110">
<s n="s1.4;p10.110">The absence of a solid political and institutional structure has also influenced the likelihood of a banking distress (Goldstein and Turner 1996, pp. 21-24). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p10.110">When agents perceive a fragile institutional environment or a weak government they tend to withdraw deposits in the domestic BS <hi rend="sup">3</hi>. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p10.110">The withdrawal of deposits usually affects the vulnerability of the BS while increasing pressure on the exchange rate. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p10.110">On the other hand, a weak institutional framework reduces the possibility of implementing adequate economic policies when the banking crisis appears. </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head>C. Banking System Vulnerabilities</head>
<div3>
<head rend="bold">C-1. Liberalisation without an adequate regulatory framework</head>
<p n="p11.110">
<s n="s1.3;p11.110">Such vulnerabilities have been extensively discussed in the literature as one of the main factors behind banking woes during the 1980s and 1990s <hi rend="sup">4,5</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p11.110">The liberalisation of the BS tends to generate an expansion in the number of banks and the overall availability of credit in the economy. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p11.110">When the process is not correctly monitored, banks may excessively accumulate risk assets thus increasing the system's overall vulnerability to negative shocks (Kaminsky and Reinhart 1999, p. 480). </s>
</p>
</div3>
<div3>
<head rend="bold">C-2. Credits and deposits denominated in foreign currency</head>
<p n="p12.110">
<s n="s1.1;p12.110">As Mishkin (1996, p. 32) points out, the existence of foreign currency-denominated </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.110">
<s n="s1.2;p13.110">assets and liabilities in the BS may lead to a banking collapse. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p13.110">Under a currency depreciation borrowers may no longer be able to pay loans in foreign currency since most of their assets are denominated in domestic money. </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.110">
<s n="s1.3;p14.110">It is worth noting that longlasting macroeconomic instability in many developing countries has affected the credibility of the private sector in both, the domestic currency and the BS. In this context, and in order to speed up the development of the financial system in certain countries, monetary authorities allowed taking deposits and credits in foreign currency. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p14.110">Nevertheless, this fact increases overall vulnerability to a banking crisis, since the capacity of the Central Bank to function as a lender of last resort is limited in this context (Chang and Velasco 1998). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p14.110">As far as agents perceive this BS vulnerability and expect a currency depreciation, a bank run as stated in Diamond and Dybvig (1983) may arise <hi rend="sup">6</hi>. </s>
</p>
</div3>
<div3>
<head rend="bold">C-3. High share of public loans</head>
<p n="p15.110">
<s n="s1.1;p15.110">As Goldstein and Turner (1996, pp. 18-21) highlight, the excessive accumulation of </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.110">
<s n="s1.2;p16.110">public debt in banks' assets also affects BS vulnerability. </s>

<p n="p19.110">
<s n="s1.2;p19.110">of public bonds diminishes, thus negatively affecting the BS balance-sheet. </s>

</p>
<p n="p20.110">
<s n="s1.1;p20.110">case, when the government defaults on the public debt the value of the banking assets may collapse <hi rend="sup">7</hi>. </s>
</p>
</div3>
<div3>
<head rend="bold">C-4. Lack of transparency in the banking system</head>
<p n="p21.110">
<s n="s1.3;p21.110">The lack of transparent information in the BS has also been highlighted as an important element in explaining BS vulnerability (see Goldstein and Turner 1996, pp. 21-24). </s>
<s n="s2.3;p21.110">Many experiences have shown that prudential measures in terms of liquidity requirements were not in accordance with the best international standards. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p21.110">The lack of transparency in banks' information affects the capacity of customers and monetary authorities to accurately determine each particular bank's situation, thus enlarging the asymmetric information problems in the system and the likelihood of a crisis. </s>

<head>D. Factors that triggered banking crises during the 1980s and 1990s</head>
<div3>
<head rend="bold">D-1. Terms of trade</head>
<p n="p22.110">
<s n="s1.1;p22.110">During the 1980s a typical external shock which ended in banking crises in </s>
</p>
<p n="p23.110">
<s n="s1.3;p23.110">developing countries was the sudden reduction in the terms of trade (see Kaminsky and Reinhart, p. 485). </s>
<s n="s2.3;p23.110">This shock negatively affects the profitability of the tradable sector thus diminishing its capability to perform its loans. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p23.110">The evidence also suggests reductions in the terms of trade have been more severe in those countries with a relative concentrated exports structure (Goldstein and Turner, p. 9). </s>

<head rend="bold">D-2. Contagion from other financial crises / capital outflows</head>

</p>
<p n="p25.110">
<s n="s1.1;p25.110">during the 1990s, it has been relatively easy and cheap for international investors to mobilize financial resources among national States. </s>
</p>
<p n="p26.110">
<s n="s1.3;p26.110">This mechanism has had an important role in the genesis of banking crises, being more important in those countries with not well-developed capital markets <hi rend="sup">8</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p26.110">The contagion mechanism usually works as follows: when a large international investor suffers a direct loss in a particular country he tends to reduce overall exposure in countries with similar characteristics, thus precipitating the likelihood of a banking crisis. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p26.110">It has been also argued that crises may be driven by sudden changes in expectations, under what is known as the multiple-equilibria scenario, thus yielding a capital outflow and in turn triggering the crisis <hi rend="sup">9</hi>. </s>

<head>E. Administration of the Crisis</head>
<div3>
<head rend="bold">E-1. Intervention / liquidation of banks</head>
<p n="p27.110">
<s n="s1.4;p27.110">Either the intervention or the liquidation of banks presents controversies in the economic literature. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p27.110">Scott (2002, p. 14) highlights that this policy helps in reducing the BS uncertainty, enhancing the natural adjustment process of the system. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p27.110">On the other hand, Hawkins and Turner (1996, p. 37) argued that this policy might have a negative effect since it may undermine the public's confidence in banks, provoking a generalised bank run. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p27.110">As a rule of thumb, and considering the Argentine case, I sustain that avoiding banks' liquidation during a crisis seems to be an adequate policy when the distress has systemic characteristics. </s>

<head rend="bold">E-2. Deposit Insurance</head>
<p n="p28.110">
<s n="s1.4;p28.110">In the economic literature exists an interesting discussion around the moral hazard problems involved with the deposit insurances (DI) (see Scott 2002). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p28.110">However, Hawkins and Turner (1996, p. 45) sustain that in most banking experiences, monetary authorities explicitly or implicitly implement a DI to avoid a negative perception of the BS by depositors. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p28.110">They also argue that the DIs have shown important differences in the sources of funding and the amounts covered. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p28.110">Furthermore, in this regard Hawkins and Turner (op cit.) sustain that it is possible to design a DI which tends to reduce the moral hazard problem by limiting the amount granted and government participation in their capitalisation. </s>

<s n="s3.3;p34.110">However, worth noting is that such policies often involve important fiscal costs and distorting incentives (e.g., moral hazard problems), the general criteria being to avoid public intervention as much as possible (Huerta and Urriza González op cit.). </s>

<s n="s1.1;p35.110">Following the classification of financial systems stated in Demirguc-Kunt and Levine (1999) the Argentine BS could be characterized as bank-based, in line with the evidence of most mid-income countries. </s>
</p>
<p n="p36.110">
<s n="s1.3;p36.110">It is worth highlighting that the importance of the Argentine BS increased markedly after the implementation of the Currency Board (CB) regime in April 1991 <hi rend="sup">11</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p36.110">This CB regime positively reverted agents' expectations about the future pattern of the economy, leading to a very fast growth of the BS (Heymann 2000, pp. 34-42). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p36.110">Argentine monetary authorities also promoted important transformations in terms of the infrastructure and regulatory frameworks of the system during the 1990s (Fanelli and Pradelli 2002, p. 22). </s>

<p n="p37.110">
<s n="s1.3;p37.110">From a regulatory viewpoint, the Central Bank of Argentina designed a strict regulatory framework to situate the BS near the best international standards. </s>
