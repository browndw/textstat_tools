<p n="p137.144">
<s n="s1.5;p137.144">Protecting intellectual property: Nowadays, Internet users can download the latest software, digital books, music, movies and update their computer systems at no cost. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p137.144">Piracy is becoming a serious issue. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p137.144">The software industry, publishing industry, and the audio-visual industry have been struggling with this issue in recent years. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p137.144">Therefore, strong legislation such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and Secure Digital Music Initiative (SDMI) has been issued to prevent or deter piracy. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p137.144">However, as the digital information is easy to distribute over the Internet, the government and organizations should work together and protect the intellectual property in appropriate ways (Gates, 2000). </s>
</p>
<p n="p138.144">
<s n="s1.3;p138.144">Regulating global commerce: As the Internet offers businesses and individuals an easy way to transactions, it is accelerating economic growth in the world. </s>

</p>
<p n="p139.144">
<s n="s1.6;p139.144">Protecting individual privacy: E-security, as it is mentioned in the above section, is arousing more and more attention. </s>

<s n="s4.6;p139.144">As many people are required by retailers to submit their personal account information when making purchasing online, some of them may concern about the safety of their account details, and will be reluctant to trust the Internet. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p139.144">This will eventually lead to the decline of sales. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p139.144">Therefore, more e-technology should be applied in the future to avoid online transaction fraud and protect individual privacy. </s>
</p>
<p n="p140.144">
<s n="s1.3;p140.144">Keeping the Internet secure: Web site hacking, credit card fraud and identity theft have affected the Internets reputation. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p140.144">In order to keep the Internet a safe place to do business, e-security barrier must be overcome as soon as possible. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p141.144">Protecting children: The Internet is transforming the traditional education system, which gives children more opportunity to know the world. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p141.144">However, it can also expose them to obscene, violent or inappropriate content. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p141.144">In reality, it is difficult to censor this unregulated global medium. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p141.144">While parents and teachers can block access to objectionable Web sites through advanced software. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p141.144">Meanwhile, government should encourage software companies to produce more child-safety e-tools. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p141.144">Law enforcement also plays an important role in prosecuting online predators (Gates, 2000). </s>
