<p n="p27.27">
<s n="s1.6;p27.27">In a nutshell, views about the European Council vary from some seeing it as conferences of government reaching unenforceable political compromises, to some seeing it as playing a formal role as the main political dynamo of the Community and, to others who consider it as the decision-making, initiative-taking and even proposal-creating body enjoying the highest authority. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p27.27">For most, it is already considered to be an institution of the EU owing to its deep involvement in Community matters, although legally speaking it is not. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p27.27">Last but not least, from a political perspective, the European Council is at the top of the hierarchical ladder as the key political forum. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p27.27">From a legal perspective though, the European Council shares the power with the other institutions, particularly the Council. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p27.27">Although it defines the broad policies of the EU, it cannot be denied that it is dependent upon the Community institutions to give them a legal status. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p27.27">With the possible ratification of the Constitutional Treaty, some views are likely to be altered since the European Council will be finally institutionalised. </s>
