<head rend="bold">Abstract &amp; Aims</head>
<p n="p1.8">
<s n="s1.3;p1.8">The aims of the experiment are to investigate the distribution of the enzyme succinate dehydrogenase in three subcellular compartments, the nucleus, the cytosol and the mitochondria, isolated from a preparation of cells from rat liver. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p1.8">The enzyme succinate dehydrogenase is found in the mitochondrial membrane, and so was most prevalent in the mitochondrial fraction. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p1.8">The cystolic fraction contained the highest percentage of protein due to the cytoskeletal material usually found in the cystol. </s>
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">Introduction</head>
<p n="p2.8">
<s n="s1.5;p2.8">Cells show a high degree of structure and organisation through the localisation of metabolic pathways and the related enzymes into distinct subcellular compartments. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p2.8">By disrupting the plasma membrane of the cell and separating the subcellular compartments it is possible to examine the metabolic pathways. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p2.8">Differential centrifugation is a common method for this separation procedure, which is known as fractionation. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p2.8">Successive centrifugations are carried out at increasing speeds, which pellets the larger particles first and smaller particles last, leaving cytosol as the supernatant. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p2.8">Typically around 90% of each fraction consists of one particular subcellular compartment. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.8">
<s n="s1.2;p3.8">The activity of succinate dehydrogenase acts as a marker for the location of the mitochondrial membrane where it is found. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p3.8">This enzyme catalyses the following reaction from the citric acid cycle. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.8">
<s n="s1.1;p4.8">
<formula notation="" id="BAWE_0032b-form.001"/> </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.8">
<s n="s1.1;p5.8">Finding the subcellular location of any enzyme would have commercial applications as a prelude to purification of the enzyme, as only the fractions containing the highest amount of protein would be used. </s>
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">Method</head>
<p n="p6.8">
<s n="s1.2;p6.8">The method followed was as described in the laboratory manual. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p6.8">For the determination of protein content of the liver homogenate fractions biorad was used to blank the spectrophotometer. </s>

<p n="p8.8">
<s n="s1.11;p8.8">Figure 1 shows the percentage content of protein and enzyme in each fraction. </s>
<s n="s2.11;p8.8">Fractions N and M contained fairly small percentages of protein. </s>
<s n="s3.11;p8.8">Fraction S however, contained nearly 45% protein. </s>
<s n="s4.11;p8.8">Fractions N and S contained small percentages of enzyme, while fraction M contained around 85% enzyme. </s>
<s n="s5.11;p8.8">Figure 2 shows the specific activity of the protein in each fraction, which is the purity of the enzyme with respect to other proteins. </s>
<s n="s6.11;p8.8">Fraction M has by far the greatest specific activity value of the four fractions. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p8.8">This fact concurs with the fact that fraction M had a high percentage content of enzyme, as a high percentage content in turn means a lower content of other cell parts and so a relatively high purity of the enzyme. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p8.8">Fraction M was the mitochondrial fraction, as such, a high concentration of enzyme was expected in this fraction because in a cell succinate dehydrogenase is located within the inner mitochondrial membrane. </s>
<s n="s9.11;p8.8">Both figures show that fraction M was not entirely enzyme, and that the fractionation left each fraction contaminated with the other fractions. </s>
<s n="s10.11;p8.8">Fraction S was the cytosol fraction, this contained the largest percentage of protein. </s>
<s n="s11.11;p8.8">This is due to the contents of a cell's cytosol being cytoskeletal material such as keratin, actin and spectrin. </s>
