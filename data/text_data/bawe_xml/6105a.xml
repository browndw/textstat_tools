<s n="s1.10;p89.94">The results show some discrepancies between the theoretical and experimental results. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p89.94">In the case of the first structure, the difference in results is quite small (0.33kg or 3.33N). </s>
<s n="s3.10;p89.94">3.33N is a low force and so this result does not need to be analysed too deeply. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p89.94">However, there are a number of possible reasons why the theoretical load is higher. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p89.94">The most likely explanation is a possible error made when determining the point of buckling. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p89.94">When the framework in structure 1 was first tested, the group were still unclear as how to determine the point of buckling, and as a result the structure had gone well past the point of buckling before the experiment stopped. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p89.94">Realising this error the experiment was repeated immediately. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p89.94">This caused the aluminium member to be slightly deformed and in the second run was not perfectly straight. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p89.94">This would have caused the member to be able to take fewer loads, and is a possible explanation for the results achieved. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p89.94">Overall, the results gained were in an acceptable degree of accuracy. </s>
</p>
<p n="p90.94">
<s n="s1.5;p90.94">The results for structure 2 show greater discrepancy with a difference in results of 1.17kg or 11.52N. This difference is slightly too high to declare the experimental load gained as being to an acceptable accuracy. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p90.94">There are number of possible explanations for the large difference, many of which are mentioned in the assumptions and error analysis sections. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p90.94">It is likely that instead of one large error, a number of small errors all contributed to the difference. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p90.94">As with the framework in structure 2, the aluminium members were already slightly bent. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p90.94">By this point there had already been two previous experiments (structure 1 tested twice), and this may have resulted in the members being able to carry less load. </s>
</p>
<p n="p91.94">
<s n="s1.3;p91.94">Further possible errors include the brass or stainless steel ends of the aluminium members. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p91.94">This would have affected the theoretical load calculation with differing Young's Modulus values. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p91.94">Whilst this may have only had a small affect on the theoretical load calculated it may have contributed to the difference in results. </s>
</p>
<p n="p92.94">
<s n="s1.3;p92.94">The framework may also not have been properly constructed. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p92.94">For example, the way the members were clipped into position may have resulted in the 45Âº angle stated in figure 1 being slightly less or more. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p92.94">Again this would not have had a large affect on the experimental load, but may well have made a contribution to the difference. </s>
</p>
<p n="p93.94">
<s n="s1.3;p93.94">It is also possible that the weights were placed on the structure in a forceful nature. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p93.94">For example, the weight placed on the structure to take the overall weight up to 2.9kg may have been dropped on the weight stack. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p93.94">This would have placed an increased load above the 2.9kg on the framework causing it to buckle. </s>
</p>
<p n="p94.94">
<s n="s1.5;p94.94">To conclude, the experiment has aided understanding into the structural analysis of trusses. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p94.94">The experiment aided the ability to determine which members would be under compression and which would be placed under tension. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p94.94">The results achieved followed theory, with the frameworks consisting of shorter members under compression holding the highest loads. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p94.94">Some errors where made in the experiment, with the difference in theoretical and measured loads highlighting this. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p94.94">The difference in results underlined the limitations of physical modelling for structural analysis. </s>
