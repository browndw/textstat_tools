<p n="p1.29">
<s n="s1.2;p1.29">For this essay I have chosen to analyse Ibsen's 'A Doll's House'. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p1.29">However, before attacking the elements of this play that qualify it as an example of naturalism, I feel the need to explore this term further, in order to form a central understanding of what 'naturalism' refers to. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.29">
<s n="s1.2;p2.29">At its most basic level, naturalism may be defined as a movement in drama at the end of the nineteenth century calling for an end to romanticism and advocating a new type of realistic drama that would reflect social and scientific developments. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p2.29">Understanding the characteristics of naturalism on stage, however, is a rather more complex. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.29">
<s n="s1.8;p3.29">The idea that became the catalyst for the development was that of the scientific method as the key to all truth and progress, a belief grounded partly in Charles Darwin's 'The Origin of Species', and firmly rooted in the works of Emile Zola, the leader of the naturalist movement. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p3.29">Developing Darwin's argument that, "...human behaviour, when viewed as a product of hereditary and environmental forces, came to seem determined by factors largely beyond any individual's control',<ref target="BAWE_0024a-ftnote.001"/> Zola thought that the dramatists search for truth should be achieved using the same method of detachment as a scientist, "While I was busy writing Therese Raquin I gave myself up entirely to precise analysis of the human being... </s>
<s n="s3.8;p3.29">I wrote every scene, even the most impassioned, with scientific curiosity alone." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0024a-ftnote.002"/>
<s n="s4.8;p3.29">Zola's much criticised scientific analysis in the novel, (it prompted one journalist to refer to it as "putrid literature") conforms entirely with the technique of the naturalist playwright to present on the stage a 'slice of life' in its most random and depressing form. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p3.29">In presenting truth on the stage, drama became brutally realistic and the typically happy endings of melodrama were erased. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p3.29">The shocking conclusion of 'A Doll's House', for example, was found to be unacceptable by many German audiences and Ibsen was forced to create a revised ending in which Nora finds herself unable to leave her children. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p3.29">Ibsen regarded this as a "barbaric violence done to the play. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p3.29">Those who make use of the altered scene do so entirely against my wish."<ref target="BAWE_0024a-ftnote.003"/> </s>

<s n="s1.3;p4.29">It is important, I think, to distinguish the term 'naturalism' from 'realism'. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p4.29">Although similar in applying to the movement as a whole, they are each defined differently as a single play can be both naturalistic and realistic, "...it would be logical to us "Naturalism" to refer to the theoretical basis shared by all dramatists who formed the movement, and their approach to representing the world. </s>

</note>
<p n="p5.29">
<s n="s1.2;p5.29">Naturalism in drama appears to present us with a truthful representation of life through an immense understanding of determinism, (which lays the foundation of the plot), morality - or rather lack of it, (evident in many of the character's actions), and illusion - which expresses theme, (evident in scenic specification). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p5.29">"The familiar irony of the phrase 'the illusion of reality' is particularly applicable to naturalistic theatre, since the nearer it approximates reality, the more illusory it in fact is."<ref target="BAWE_0024a-ftnote.005"/> </s>

<p n="p6.29">
<s n="s1.3;p6.29">In order for this presentation of 'real life' on stage to be believable, a need for verisimilitude between all aspects of the production is introduced. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p6.29">When this unity is acquired, naturalism in performance can fully achieve its aim of creating an awareness of social issues, "When society becomes more preoccupied with the quality of life rather than the life itself, so the theatre becomes less exaggerated and more concerned with debating the realities of living." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0024a-ftnote.006"/>
<s n="s3.3;p6.29">Ibsen was aware of this, and his treatment of the elements of dialogue, character, plot structure, themes and setting in 'A Doll's House', illustrate why it is considered an example of naturalism. </s>

<p n="p7.29">
<s n="s1.6;p7.29">An aspect typical of the majority of naturalistic plays, are highly detailed stage directions. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p7.29">Before each of the three act in 'A Doll's House', a mood is created by the changes in setting. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p7.29">The scene implies that Ibsen intended to stage an illusion using an over detailed naturalistic design. </s>
