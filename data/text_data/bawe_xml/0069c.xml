<p n="p4.10">
<s n="s1.8;p4.10">Traditionally, the courts had maintained the rule that in situations where one contracting party, A, promises to pay an additional sum to fellow contracting party, B, provided B undertakes to perform their existing contractual obligations to A, B's return promise does not provide sufficient consideration, and that if one party promises to modify their obligations without fresh consideration being provided in return, the promise to vary the original agreement is gratuitous and hence unenforceable. </s>

<s n="s5.8;p4.10">Arguably, the captain enjoyed some 'practical benefit' in the form of his crew working harder, under greater pressure due to lack of crewmen, and that this could amount to consideration. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p4.10">However this idea was dismissed, the court concluding that the sailors "<hi rend="italic">had sold all their services till the voyage should be completed</hi>

<s n="s7.8;p4.10">Lord Ellenborough placed the most importance on deciphering the legal obligations of the remaining crew, deciding that they had not done anything more than what they were already legally obliged to do under the contract, hence no consideration. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p4.10">The position of the courts was hence established, strengthening the importance of investigating benefits/detriments under contract as a matter of law, rather than as 'factual' or 'practical'. </s>

<hi rend="italic">Roffey Bros,</hi> consideration was deemed sufficient in the form of a promise to perform existing contractual obligations? </s>
<s n="s3.10;p6.10">We must look at the details of the case. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p6.10">The plaintiff had entered into a subcontract with the defendants, who held the main building contract which itself contained a time penalty clause, to carry out carpentry work in a block of flats for an agreed price of Â£20,000. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p6.10">The plaintiff then ran into financial difficulty due to the agreed price being too low for him to operate profitably at. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p6.10">Consequently, a new agreement was made under which the plaintiff would be paid an additional Â£10,300 (Â£575 per completed flat). </s>
<s n="s7.10;p6.10">The defendants were wary of incurring the penalty clause that was likely to take effect if they were to try and find a suitable replacement for the existing carpenters. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p6.10">After the substantial completion of 8 more flats, Williams had only received a further Â£1,500. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p6.10">He subsequently left the site and sued for remaining payment. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p6.10">The Court of Appeal judges unanimously agreed to uphold the County Court decision that had awarded the plaintiff Â£4,600 for such substantially completed work. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.10">
<s n="s1.4;p7.10">Crucially, here the judges emphasised the importance of 'practical benefits' that accrued due to the re-negotiation of the contract - i.e. the assured avoidance of the penalty clause<ref target="BAWE_0069c-ftnote.006"/> and the mutual benefit enjoyed due to the creation of a system of payment reconciling the haphazard original agreement. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p7.10">It also remained largely uncontested that the original agreed amount of pay owed to the sub-contractors was too low. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p7.10">Lord Glidewell defined a newly revised legal position, essentially stating that in situations when one of two contracting parties runs into difficulty and is potentially unable to fully perform their contractual obligations, a new agreement can be legally binding if, through a promise to pay additional sums to the party suffering difficulty, the other party obtains some practical benefit or obviates a disbenefit. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p7.10">Good consideration can be in the form of such promises in these situations, provided the new agreement is not induced by fraud or economic duress. </s>

<p n="p8.10">
<s n="s1.7;p8.10">It is arguable that this rouses ambiguity in the scope of consideration as it appears to contest and hence distort the traditional stance of the courts. </s>

<s n="s3.7;p8.10">
<hi rend="italic">Myrick</hi>. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p8.10">Williams was only doing what he was already contracted to do, as were the sailors in <hi rend="italic">Stilk,</hi> and yet the promise to perform his pre-existing contractual duties was construed as good consideration in the new agreement. </s>

<s n="s6.7;p8.10">
<hi rend="italic">Roffey,</hi> it now appears to concern itself more with the realism element of the contract and the true intention of the parties - the 'practical' benefits/detriments seem more significant to the judges than those existing legally. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p8.10">It is a shift from the traditional, pragmatic approach, placing the law in its more modern context - "a <hi rend="italic">decision inspired by modern market-individualism</hi>

<s n="s3.13;p9.10">This seems fair as it is perhaps inevitable and useful that such a long-established precedent relating to such a vexed area of contract law should be placed into a modern arena to be tried and tested. </s>

<s n="s7.13;p9.10">The 'practical benefits' enjoyed by the defendants, post re-negotiation, made it unconscionable that such a contract should not be upheld for lack of consideration. </s>
