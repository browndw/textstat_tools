<s n="s1.6;p15.28">RecA protein is a crucial enzyme in the recombination process as it catalyses the pairing of single-stranded DNA with complementary double-stranded DNA. The loading of RecA protein in the DNA is facilitated by the RecBCD enzyme (Arnold <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> 2000) and during the helical polymerisation of the RecA monomers the single-stranded DNA is extended in length by 1.6 angstroms pre axial base pair. </s>

<s n="s1.11;p25.28">The integration of the λ genome is a reciprocal recombination. </s>
<s n="s2.11;p25.28">The phage chromosome is circularised upon entering the bacterial cell and contains a short 15 base pair region of homology with the E.coli genome. </s>
<s n="s3.11;p25.28">This region in the phage is the <hi rend="italic">attP</hi> site and in the bacteria <hi rend="italic">attB</hi> (figure 10). </s>
<s n="s4.11;p25.28">Due to such a small region of homology a recombination cannot take place without the enzyme intergrase (Int) being present. </s>
<s n="s5.11;p25.28">All Int reactions are chiral, producing one of two possibilities enantiomers of each product. </s>
<s n="s6.11;p25.28">Crisona <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> 1999 proposed that this chirality reflects a right handed DNA crossing within or between recombination sites in the synaptic complex that favours formation of right handed Holliday junction intermediates. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p25.28">Within the reaction there is no net loss or gain of DNA so the reaction is said to be conservative. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p25.28">The <hi rend="italic">attB</hi> site is simple and only 25 base pairs long, the <hi rend="italic">attP</hi> site however is more complex and much larger at 240 Base pairs long. </s>
<s n="s9.11;p25.28">This complex interaction site within the intergrase requires superhelicity of the DNA substrate. </s>
<s n="s10.11;p25.28">It is argued in Sadwski Mini-review that the complex site is a reflection of the need to organise the DNA and protein into a supermolecule structure analogous to a nucleosome. </s>
<s n="s11.11;p25.28">This structure is called an intosome and that the negative super helicity facilitates the DNA wrapping around the intergrase enzyme. </s>

<p n="p26.28">
<s n="s1.7;p26.28">The carboxy-terminal domain of of Int binds to the core sequence of the attachments sites at the point where breakage and reunion occur. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p26.28">The amino terminal of the Int enzyme binds with high affinity to the sequences either side of the core region, and it is thought that this high affinity binding guides the Int protein to the core of the recombination site when enzyme affinity is low (Crisona <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> 1999). </s>
<s n="s3.7;p26.28">During recombination a phosphodiester bond is broken in the DNA and it is to this that the intergrase enzyme attaches at the 3' - phosphoryl terminus. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p26.28">The model for strand exchange was proposed by Nash <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> 1975 for intergrase promoted recombination. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p26.28">The intergrase enzyme induces a four stranded intermediate composed of two synapse duplex recombination sites. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p26.28">This structure is formed by a sequential series of breakages and reunions of the four DNA strands. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p26.28">This intermediate is analogous to the Holliday junction seen in homologous recombination and it is the intergrase that is able to resolve the junction but in a site specific manner. </s>

<head rend="underlined">Conclusion</head>
<p n="p27.28">
<s n="s1.6;p27.28">The two methods of genetic recombination covered in this article both occur using a similar physical technique of a four stranded Holliday type junction forming and of two synapse duplex recombination sites. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p27.28">Both processes are enzyme dependant; the phage λ reaction will not take place without the intergrase enzyme being present and the homologous recombination reaction requires RecBCD, RecA and various other protein molecules. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p27.28">Both recombination events show some branch migration of the DNA, in homologous recombination this branch migration can be of infinite distance but in the phage λ integration this migration only continues for 7 base pairs of DNA. Homologous recombination can physically occur in any part of the bacterial DNA strand, the only requirement is the presence of DNA with a significant region of homology to it. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p27.28">The phage λ integration however is site specific and can only occur between the gene coding for biotin production and galactose metabolism because it is between theses two sites that the attachment sires <hi rend="italic">attB</hi> is found. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p27.28">A further difference between the two is the ability of the phage λ DNA integration reaction to be reversed, allowing the phage DNA to be excised again specifically which allows the virus to move from a lysogenic state into a lytic phase. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p27.28">The reversal of the genetic recombination reaction doesn't occur during homologous recombination. </s>
</p>
<p n="p28.28">
<s n="s1.1;p28.28">There are several other methods of genetic recombination n bacteria including transposon integration along with several other bacteriophage integration method, for it is often the case that different lysogenic bacteriophage have varying methods of chromosome integration. </s>
