<s n="s1.7;p26.36">A chapter of about twenty pages was dedicated to the Design argument. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p26.36">While I did read through the entire chapter, I did not feel the need to use it for my essay. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p26.36">I found the writing very hard-going and particularly one-sided, as it seemed to favour Hume's arguments. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p26.36">I also felt that the essay digressed from the point. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p26.36">Unlike the other books I used, this book did not outline the main point of the Design argument, but merely discussed the concept of a creator in several religions. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p26.36">There were no quotes from thinkers or philosophers and names that were becoming familiar to me, such as Kant and Swinburne, did not crop up in this book. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p26.36">Although this was a fairly deep, slightly unique way to engage with the Design argument, I felt I did not gain much from reading it. </s>

<p n="p27.36">
<s n="s1.6;p27.36">Among others, this was the book I found most useful when writing my essay. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p27.36">There are sections dedicated to each argument and objection in regards to the Design argument. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p27.36">Hume's arguments were clearly laid out, with reference to his work <hi rend="italic">Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion</hi>. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p27.36">Objections raised by Swinburne, Tennant and Kant were also included, giving a clear and concise understanding of the overall debate concerning the Design argument. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p27.36">I would recommend this book to anyone approaching the Design argument with a blank slate as each section is broken down and explained thoroughly. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p27.36">I found it particularly useful to quote from, as the book has been written quite simplistically, so the quotes were not too long or detailed. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p30.36">This was a collection of writings and statements by various philosophers and thinkers. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p30.36">The ones particularly useful to my essay were the chapters on John Stuart Mill and F.R. Tennant. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p30.36">I was glad I chose this book as Mill and Tennant were not dominant in my essay but I liked to include them as they offered valid points towards the Design argument. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p30.36">I also found that there was not much literature on these philosophers on the reading list so I was glad to have some of their own writing to incorporate into my essay. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p30.36">While the other books offered the views and ideas of Mill and Tennant, they did not offer much of their own writing. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p30.36">This would be good for a student who was looking for a collection of writings by many philosophers all in one book. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p30.36">Therefore, this would be a good investment as it will come in handy when writing any essay for Philosophy. </s>

<p n="p33.36">
<s n="s1.5;p33.36">This book had a whole chapter dedicated to Hume's main arguments against the Design argument, titling it as "Hume's Legacy." </s>
<s n="s2.5;p33.36">His arguments were broken down into three sections. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p33.36">Each section had excerpts from Hume's <hi rend="italic">Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion</hi> to back up the points in the arguments. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p33.36">I found that the only thing lacking were counter-arguments or objections to Hume's ideas, although D.Z. Phillips did include other thinkers and philosophers who agreed with Hume. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p33.36">I found this book useful in explaining and breaking down Hume's main arguments and was particularly good for making the dialogues between Cleanthes, Demea and Philo clear. </s>

<s n="s3.7;p34.36">The section dedicated to Paley's writing was particularly useful as I did not have any books specifically on Paley's own writings about the Design argument. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p34.36">It was good to have the watch maker theory in Paley's own words to include in the essay. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p34.36">I had no need to use the section on Hume as I already had <hi rend="italic">Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion.</hi> </s>
<s n="s6.7;p34.36">The sections did not have any further literature, to criticise or explain the writings. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p34.36">This would be useful if one could not find the original works of Paley and Hume. </s>

<p n="p35.36">
<s n="s1.6;p35.36">I managed to use several chapters of this book, among them being the discussions about Teleological Arguments and The Problem of Evil. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p35.36">This book was useful as Swinburne appeared much in my essay and I wanted to have quotes and writings from his own book, rather than use a critic. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p35.36">His writing was intricate, yet easy to understand and his objections were broken down nicely. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p35.36">I found this book crucial to my essay as I referred to it constantly. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p35.36">Each section had a sub-title, which meant it didn't get too confusing and in depth. </s>

<s n="s2.7;p36.36">Each section explained and analysed the various arguments and objections outlined by Hume, Kant, Swinburne, Mill and Tennant. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p36.36">At the end of each section, Vardy offered bullet points to summarise the main points of the section, which proved very useful when I wanted to refresh my memory. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p36.36">The chapter was quite detailed but didn't become confusing. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p36.36">I used this book as my main reference source, quoting some main points that I managed to glean from it. </s>
