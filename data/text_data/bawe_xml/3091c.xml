<s n="s1.7;p1.42">Buckling has become more of a problem in recent years since the use of high strength material requires less material for load support structures and components have become generally more slender and buckle- prone. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p1.42">This trend has continued throughout technological history. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p1.42">When Romans built bridges columns and buckling phenomena wasn't understood, typical bridge designs of that earer had many tiers to the design to overcome the problem of buckling. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p1.42">Technological improvements over many centuries became apparent as slender columns began to appear in designs. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p1.42">In modern structures the use of slender columns is ever more apparent due the cost saving involved in using less material to deliver the same structural strength. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p1.42">A good example of the use of slender columns in the Humber road bridge, opened in 1981, comprising of a continuously welded closed box road deck suspended from catenary cables supported on reinforced concrete towers. </s>

<p n="p9.42">
<s n="s1.6;p9.42">If a slender rod is subjected to an axial load, the rod is said to be under compression. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p9.42">If the compression load is increased, there will eventually be a point where the slender rod starts deflecting laterally. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p9.42">The point at which this lateral deflection begins is know as the critical load. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p9.42">If the load is removed before the critical load is reached the slender rod will return to its original shape, and the rods elastic limit will not have been passed. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p9.42">However if the critical load is exceeded then the slender rod will deform and begin to buckle. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p9.42">Once buckling has commenced it very quickly leads to total failure of the rod. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.42">
<s n="s1.2;p10.42">The equation used to calculate the critical buckling load can be seen in Equation 1, notice the sign 'α' which denotes a constraint factor. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p10.42">This factor takes into account various ways of constraining beams in compression, the stress at the critical load can be found by using Equation 2, where the critical load is divided by the cross sectional area of the slender rod/beam. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.42">
<s n="s1.2;p11.42">Figure 3 shows the different values used for α under certain constraints. </s>

</p>
<p n="p12.42">
<s n="s1.4;p12.42">Another point to note is that the minimum moment of inertia is used to calculate the critical load. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p12.42">In this report circular rods were used, and therefore the circular cross section was the same. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p12.42">If however the cross section area varies such as in a 'T' section then the two moment of inertia values for the X and Y axis must be determined, and the smaller of the two values must be used. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p12.42">This is because bending will occur about the axis for which I is minimum. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p30.42">Looking at the results shown in Graph 1 it can be seen that the actual test results and the calculated results follow the same fit line as each other, this indicates that the theoretical results describe the same characteristics as those of the test results. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p30.42">However it is clear when studying that actual point values that the test result values are lower in magnitude than those which are calculated. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p30.42">Also of interest is the fact that the theoretical results only have 3 points shown on the graph, since the calculated stress values go much higher than the yield stress of the material. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p30.42">Therefore these points are considered unrealistic and are not shown. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p30.42">Although they are included in the calculation of the best fit line, which ensures that the results calculated relate to the test results correctly. </s>
</p>
<p n="p31.42">
<s n="s1.2;p31.42">The test results also show that as the slenderness ration is decreased (i.e the length of the rod is shortened since the radius of gyration 'K' remains constant<ref target="BAWE_3091c-ftnote.001"/>) the critical stresses increase. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p31.42">This proves the theory that as the slenderness ratio is decreased the stability of the column is increased and therefore the limiting factor of the load that is able to be supported it set by the materials yield stress. </s>

<p n="p32.42">
<s n="s1.6;p32.42">Looking at where the theoretical results best fit line crosses the yield stress of the material and where the test results sit in relation to both these lines it is feasible to assume that the slender rod buckled before it yielded. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p32.42">It would appear from the theoretical results that the value for the slenderness ratio where the rod would yield before buckle is around 55. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p32.42">However if shorter lengths of rod were tested then the actual test results would be more likely to follow the realistic results of a decreased rise in critical stress value as the slenderness ratio is decreased until the rod reached its yield stress. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p32.42">Figure 4 explains this occurrence, it shows the relationship between the materials elastics modulus against the columns slenderness ratio Vs stress. </s>

</p>
<p n="p33.42">
<s n="s1.3;p33.42">The theoretical values calculated for the critical stress are higher than the actual test results since the theoretical results assume a prefect slender rod where as realistically the rod is not perfectly straight, with a uniform cross section throughout, nor is the load applied perfectly concentric. </s>

<p n="p34.42">
<s n="s1.2;p34.42">Graph 2 results are very similar to those in Graph 1 in that they show that the Euler equation can be used to predict performance of a column design as long as it remains within its linear elastic region on the modulus graph. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p34.42">As in the test results for the 6mm diameter slender rod Graph 2 shows that the rod tended to buckle before yielding, this was confirmed by the samples being slightly deformed when they were removed from the tensile test machine indicating the slender rods had passed their elastic limit. </s>

<s n="s1.1;p35.42">It is clear from the results that the use of the Euler equation is an effective method for the evaluation of column design performance, providing the limits of the formula are known. </s>

<s n="s1.1;p36.42">It is also clear why the limits of the Euler formula exist, and has been shown that the Euler formula is only valid while the material behaviour remains within the linear elastic region of its modulus. </s>
</p>
<p n="p37.42">
<s n="s1.1;p37.42">It has been shown that due to the imperfections present in the materials properties, shape (varying CSA) and loading misalignment that the theoretical values tend to be greater than those found during testing, for this reason the use of safety factors is recommended. </s>

<p n="p38.42">
<s n="s1.1;p38.42">Columns that buckle within the elastic region are some times termed "Long columns" where as columns that have low slenderness ratios and essentially have no buckling phenomena are called "Short Columns". </s>

<s n="s2.2;p39.42">The only material property that is involved is the elastic modulus, which represents the physical stiffness characteristic of the material. </s>

<p n="p40.42">
<s n="s1.1;p40.42">Slenderness ratio and material properties are used in the design of columns to determine to the critical stress in straight axially loaded columns. </s>

<p n="p41.42">
<s n="s1.1;p41.42">Buckling occurs about the axis whose moment of inertia is minimum, therefore columns that have irregular cross sectional areas and therefore different moment of inertias must use the minimum I value when calculating critical loads and stresses. </s>
