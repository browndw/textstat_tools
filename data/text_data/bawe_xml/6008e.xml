<s n="s1.1;p1.14">Milk and milk products may be heat treated by a range of processes, according to the properties requires after processing. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.14">
<s n="s1.4;p2.14">UHT is a continuous process which involves the use of high processing temperature (135-150 <hi rend="sup">o</hi>C) in a short time, holds at that temperature for a sufficient length of time (1-10s) to produce a satisfactory level of commercial sterility with an acceptable amount of change in the product. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p2.14">Since the chemical changes in the product are minimized by using the highest possible temperature for the shortest time needed to give the required sterilizing effect. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p2.14">It is believed that the best overall processing effects on the product will be obtained if the rate of heating to the final temperature is as rapid as possible. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p2.14">(Burton, 1988) </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.14">
<s n="s1.5;p3.14">There are many types of UHT processing plant but all aim to give a satisfactory product. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p3.14">Also, the UHT process can be divided into two major groups according to the heat-exchange system applied. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p3.14">The two groups are direct and indirect heating systems. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p3.14">The heating medium in most types is steam or hot water. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p3.14">(Burton, 1988) </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.14">
<s n="s1.5;p4.14">For indirect heating system, the product being processed and the heating medium are separated by a heat-conducting barrier. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p4.14">Thus there is no physical contact between the product and the heating medium. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p4.14">A proportion of the heat transfer will be in the form of regeneration, i.e. heat will be extracted form the product to cool it from the sterilizing temperature and be transferred to the incoming product. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p4.14">Then much of the energy required for heating to the sterilizing temperature is recycled from within the processing system and thus save the production cost. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p4.14">(Burton, 1988) </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.14">
<s n="s1.3;p5.14">High temperature applied to sterilize milk may induce many chemical changes. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p5.14">Some of these are important because they change those characteristics of the milk that are easily recognized, e.g. colour and flavour. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p5.14">Others may cause changes in nutritive value of milk. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p12.14">UHT processing usually give rise to better quality milk because it involves rapid heating and cooling. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p12.14">Using high temperature for shorter time will decrease the amount of chemical change. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p12.14">The colour of the UHT product is whiter than raw milk because of the denaturation of the serum proteins of the milk. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p12.14">It shows a little bit of browning because of Mailard reaction. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p12.14">There is cooked flavour in the UHT milk because of the break down of cells, proteins which cause the formation of hydrogen sulphide. </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.14">
<s n="s1.6;p13.14">After the UHT treatment, milk is commercial sterilized and will be filled in glass or plastic bottles and paper boxes. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p13.14">However, there may be some quality changes after storage. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p13.14">These changes which take place during storage depend on temperature of storage, extent of exposure of the milk to light and availability of oxygen. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p13.14">Cooked flavour will become stronger, sediment may form and accumulate in the bottom after storage. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p13.14">Some reactants like heat resistant enzymes which survive even after UHT process may modify the products during extended storage. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p13.14">Dissolved oxygen may remain in UHT milk and cause oxidative changes. </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.14">
<s n="s1.4;p14.14">During indirect heat processing, fouling of heat exchanger may occur. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p14.14">It consists of the deposition of milk solids on the heating surface of heat exchanger. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p14.14">This will decrease the rate of heat transfer and the milk may not be completely steriled. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p14.14">Enzymes which may not be fully inactivate and heat resistant micro-organisms remain in the products, cracks on containers which let micro-organisms to enter the products will lead to microbiological spoilage. </s>
