<s n="s1.7;p1.16">Although the role of the people within politics has long been assessed and discussed, a consensus has failed to emerge, with much of the debate still centring upon the concept of 'politics'. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p1.16">With few formal and representative institutions during the early modern period, formal political participation of the people can be seen to have been minimal, seemingly reinforcing the assertion that they had no role to play in politics. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p1.16">Such an assertion however, can be seen to neglect recent scholarship, which suggests a less polar division between the people and politics, with a greater emphasis placed upon community involvement and the persist acts of resistance and rebellion. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p1.16">In order to then assess the role of the people in politics, we need to consider both the formal and informal ways in which the people participated. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p1.16">Most importantly we need to define the concept of 'politics', as our assessment ultimately rests upon its interpretation. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p1.16">Furthermore we need to consider the lack of homogeneity within the period. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p1.16">Divisions and differences can be found between as well as within composite states and kingdoms, making any over arching assessment problematic and difficult. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.16">
<s n="s1.3;p2.16">Andy Wood in his analysis of popular politics, charts the differing interpretations of the role of the people in politics, arguing that 'social historians of early modern England used to avoid politics'.<ref target="BAWE_0144b-ftnote.001"/> Such an assessment raises considerable problems to our analysis, given that scholarship would seemingly neglect and ignore the role of the people in politics. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p2.16">It was not until the 1980s that a 'new' social history emerged, investigating and recognising; crime, urbanisation, disease, literacy, population growth and social change.<ref target="BAWE_0144b-ftnote.002"/> These 'new' social histories recognised conflict, that was intense and protracted, which often resulted in collective protest, riot and demonstration; such investigations then provide us with evidence to suggest that the people did have a certain degree of power and discontent, but the question of their role within politics can still be contested. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p2.16">Wood argues that for many of these historians, it was still assumed that 'political' affairs were conducted only within established institutions, with the localism of early modern riots not guaranteeing their 'pre-political' character, and that these conflicts over resources possessed no inherent politics. <ref target="BAWE_0144b-ftnote.003"/> </s>

<s n="s1.2;p3.16">Such assessments can be challenged by 'post-revisionist' scholarship, which questions the validity of the clear distinctions between 'elite' and 'popular' politics, recognising the formation of a 'public sphere' of debate within early modern European towns.<ref target="BAWE_0144b-ftnote.004"/> Politics can therefore be seen to include discussion, debate and action, fundamentally understood in social terms, as a manifestation of argumentation and contestation of disparities of power.<ref target="BAWE_0144b-ftnote.005"/> With early modern notions of authority encompassing a whole range of relationships, between the young and old, men and women, employer and employee, rich and poor, and priest and parishioner, political behaviour therefore emerges when ever there are groups in opposition.<ref target="BAWE_0144b-ftnote.006"/> Politics then occurs with any attempt to extend, reassert or challenge the distribution of power, thus, as Wood asserts, 'politics is dynamic, deriving from fluidity, change, interaction and conflict'.<ref target="BAWE_0144b-ftnote.007"/> In our analysis of the role of the people in politics, we need then to identify when the boundaries between groups are in contention, in order to recognise the occurrence of political activity. </s>

<s n="s4.4;p5.16">Although such representation was exclusive to those to which the franchise extended, it nevertheless provided a channel in which some people could play a part in politics, 'a complex procedure of consideration of issues in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords'<ref target="BAWE_0144b-ftnote.010"/>. </s>

<s n="s2.3;p12.16">As Tilly concludes, efforts to seize peasant labour, commodities and capital 'violated peasant rights, jeopardised the interests of other parties in peasant production and threatened the ability of the peasants to survive as peasants'.<ref target="BAWE_0144b-ftnote.030"/> The revolts then represented political acts, as they attempted to redress the power relationships between state and subject, by acting in a manner that extended beyond their prescribed status. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p12.16">Tilly's analysis thus needs to be placed within its context, where definitions of politics failed to extend beyond formal intuitions; reinterpretations of its constitution thus enables us to reinterpret Tilly's research as supporting the interpretation that the people played a part in politics. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p14.16">Outright rebellion and riot were often the exception rather than the norm, however James C. Scott argues that there witnessed 'a constant struggle between the peasantry and those who sought to extract labour, food, taxes, rents and interest from them'.<ref target="BAWE_0144b-ftnote.035"/> Scott argues then that resistance could be represented by foot dragging, dissimulation, false compliance, pilfering, feigned ignorance, slander, arson and sabotage.<ref target="BAWE_0144b-ftnote.036"/> 'Symbolic' resistance could also be located within the early modern period; malicious gossip, character assignation, nicknames and rumour, violated expected behaviour in an effort to advance the claims and interests against others.<ref target="BAWE_0144b-ftnote.037"/> Although the impact of these actions upon the structure of power is not very appreciable, it still represented a means available for a subordinate class to clothe the practice of resistance with the safe disguise of outward compliance.<ref target="BAWE_0144b-ftnote.038"/> Furthermore, as Scott concludes, these actions 'may force renegotiation of the limits of appropriate change, the course of subsequent development, and they may merely help bring the system down'.<ref target="BAWE_0144b-ftnote.039"/> Such actions then challenge the notion that due to the lack of formal institutions and large persistent acts of rebellion, the relationship between the people and other groups was a static one. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p14.16">Although the manner in which the relationship was challenged appears hidden, it was an attempt by the people to defy obedience that was expected from them, thereby representing a political act by challenging the relationship between master and servant. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p15.16">Magagna, in his research, points also to community politics, where the people could be seen to have been involved intimately 'to enforce ideals and held practices'.<ref target="BAWE_0144b-ftnote.040"/> The relationship between men and women, master and subject and between different social groups, were maintained through such community mechanisms as the family, charivari and the scolds bridle, as well as through state law.<ref target="BAWE_0144b-ftnote.041"/> Although the people were unable to influence much of the law, community practices were conducted at a local level and were frequently occurring, marking the people's involvement in politics. </s>
