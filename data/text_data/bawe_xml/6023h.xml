<head>Questions </head>

<head rend="bold">1. Is homogenisation best between heating or best between cooling? </head>
<p n="p26.42">
<s n="s1.1;p26.42">Between heating, if components of the milk are well distributed the flow through the tubes is better and may result in less fouling. </s>
</p>
</div3>
<div3>
<head>
<hi rend="bold">2. Why does UHT processing usually give rise to a better quality?</hi> Because it is a high temperature short time process which usually results in less chemical damage to important nutrients and functional ingredients (2003, Lewis, class notes) hence the natural flavour is not compromised greatly.</head>
<p n="p27.42"/>
</div3>
<div3>
<head rend="bold">3. Where does the cooked flavour come from in milk products? </head>
<p n="p28.42">
<s n="s1.2;p28.42">The products processed at higher temperature had cooked flavour. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p28.42">This comes from the sulphydryl compounds in the milk </s>
</p>
</div3>
<div3>
<head>4.<hi rend="bold"> How are such products packaged?</hi> </head>
<p n="p29.42">
<s n="s1.1;p29.42">They are packaged in aseptic containers which range from tetra packs lined with sterilized foil, plastic bottles or glass bottles in cases where the milk is processed within the glass which is its final packaging, cans and flexible pouches </s>
</p>
</div3>
<div3>
<head>5.<hi rend="bold"> Describe the changes which may take place during storage?</hi> </head>
<p n="p30.42">
<s n="s1.1;p30.42">Browning, oxidation of sulphydryl groups, loss of vitamin C and lipid oxidation </s>

<div3>
<head rend="bold">6. What practical problems may occur during processing? </head>
<p n="p31.42">
<s n="s1.1;p31.42">Fouling, need to clean more often the higher the processing temperatures used </s>
</p>
<p n="p32.42">
<s n="s1.1;p32.42">Main problem faced with UHT is that at low temperatures you are trying to attain to avoid cooked flavour , pressure goes down to compensate .A rise in temperature consequently also results in a rise in temperature. </s>
</p>
</div3>
<div3>
<head rend="bold">7. List some reasons for microbiological spoilage of the product? </head>
<p n="p33.42">
<s n="s1.1;p33.42">This may be due to Insufficient processing i.e. necessary processing temperatures not being achieved or held or a combination of both </s>
</p>
<p n="p34.42">
<s n="s1.3;p34.42">Major cause however is post - processing contamination, where contaminants enter the product during handling before packaging i.e. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p34.42">In the cooling section. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p34.42">Defective packaging may also lead to contamination </s>

<head rend="underlined bold"> SUMMARY</head>
<p n="p37.42">
<s n="s1.1;p37.42">"The philosophy of UHT processing should be based on minimising microbial spoilage by understanding and controlling the process (Lewis 2003)." </s>
</p>
<p n="p38.42">
<s n="s1.1;p38.42">Good quality milk should show no flocculation in 80% alcohol solution, the raw milk sample tested showed slight curdling in an 80% solution of alcohol, it was still however considered stable and the running time of the sterilizer was not shortened. </s>
</p>
<p n="p39.42">
<s n="s1.2;p39.42">The mean freezing point depression of milk is often quoted as -0.535°H, which is taken as an appropriate standard for estimation of added water. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p39.42">(Coveney L, 1993) </s>
</p>
<p n="p40.42">
<s n="s1.1;p40.42">Raw milk gave a value of 517m°C which warrants no action according to the Code of practice for the assessment of milk quality (Joint committee (1985) Code of practice for the Assessment of milk quality) UHT milk however gave a reading of 516m°C which warrants a warning letter then a check of the premises if repeated. </s>
</p>
<p n="p41.42">
<s n="s1.1;p41.42">The in-container sterilised product is of lower quality because the product heats and cools relatively slowly; furthermore the temperatures are limited by the internal pressure generated. </s>
</p>
<p n="p42.42">
<s n="s1.1;p42.42">Selection of the optimum equipment , raw materials and processing conditions is a key factor in the success of any UHT treatment . </s>
