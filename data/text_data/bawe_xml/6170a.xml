<head rend="bold">DISCUSSION OF THE METHOD</head>
<p n="p12.64">
<s n="s1.4;p12.64">Heuristic evaluation is the most frequently used method of usability testing. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p12.64">It was invented by usability consultant Jakob Nielsen. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p12.64">Its aim is to specify the usability issues of the user interface. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p12.64">It has been chosen for conducting the test as it is suitable for all stages of development process, including product review after market release (the case of our test). </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.64">
<s n="s1.4;p13.64">In this method a group of experts is supposed to examine the interface according to a standard set of heuristics - evaluation criteria used in usability testing. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p13.64">The experts should have a wide knowledge of human factors and human-computer interface. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p13.64">However it occurs that also those less experiences may report valid usability issues. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p13.64">Ideally the evaluator should also have (besides usability testing experience) understanding of subject matter. </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.64">
<s n="s1.2;p14.64">A group of evaluators note down all elements which do not comply with the established usability principles and next put them into the order of descending importance. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p14.64">It is desirable that the experts go through the interface at least twice: first time - to get familiar with the system and second time - to focus on specific interface elements. </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.64">
<s n="s1.2;p15.64">This is quick and relatively cheap inspection method. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p15.64">It provides valid and useful feedback for designers how to improve the user interface and what needs improving. </s>
</p>
<div3>
<head rend="bold">Plan</head>
<p n="p16.64">
<s n="s1.2;p16.64">First the criteria for the experts should be established. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p16.64">The criteria should take use scenarios into account. </s>
</p>
</div3>
<div3>
<head rend="bold">Running</head>
<p n="p17.64">
<s n="s1.1;p17.64">To make heuristic evaluation successful we must ensure that: </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p18.64">
<s n="s1.1;p18.64">Experts have enough time to become familiar with all essential information concerning the user context and scenarios. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p19.64">
<s n="s1.1;p19.64">All experts agree on evaluation criteria </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p20.64">
<s n="s1.1;p20.64">Experts do not communicate with each other during the test, each of them should conduct the test independently. </s>
</p>
<p n="p21.64">
<s n="s1.5;p21.64">The experts write down their observations during surfing the web. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p21.64">They are supposed to inspect various elements of the interface and compare them with the list of heuristics. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p21.64">Clearly they are allowed to examine the interface with regard to any additional usability rules. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p21.64">Having completed the tasks they are supposed to prioritize the usability issues. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p21.64">At this stage they can consult with each other. </s>
</p>
<p n="p22.64">
<s n="s1.4;p22.64">It has been proved that even a very experienced expert can fail to notice some of the usability issues therefore to achieve better results the test should be conducted by several evaluators. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p22.64">One would think that the more evaluators we hire the better results we get. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p22.64">Unfortunately this is not necessarily true as the benefit to cost ratio starts to decrease rapidly with too big amount of evaluators. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p22.64">According to Nielsen the optimal number of evaluators is 3 to 5. </s>
</p>
<p n="p23.64">
<s n="s1.2;p23.64">A typical expert session lasts 1 to 2 hours however in case of large and very complicated interfaces more time might be needed. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p23.64">It is then recommended to have more than one session each concentrating on a specific part of the user interface. </s>
</p>
<p n="p24.64">
<s n="s1.3;p24.64">Having conducted the heuristic evaluation we should get a list of usability problems with reference which heuristic has been violated. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p24.64">The evaluators are supposed not only to point the problem but also explain why it is a problem (according to usability principles). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p24.64">It is essential to be as specific as possible. </s>
</p>
<p n="p25.64">
<s n="s1.1;p25.64">Basing on heuristic evaluation output it will be easy to redesign the system to make it more usable. </s>

<item>

<hi rend="bold">Description</hi> When we go to Accessories > Chargers &amp; Batteries there is a dropdown menu to select manufacturer. Sony Ericsson option is displayed twice and we assume both options are the same. However it occurs that the first one enables to choose models of Ericsson and Sony Ericsson whereas the second one enables to choose models of Sony brand. </item>
<item>
<hi rend="bold">Solution</hi> There should be three separate options: Ericsson, Sony, Sony Ericsson. </item>
<item>
<hi rend="bold">Rationale</hi> Two options of the same name cause much confusion and people think that both point to the same place. </item>

<item>
<hi rend="bold">Rationale</hi> People will be surprised that they have to pay for something they haven't ordered and they will not recommend the service to their friends. </item>

<hi rend="bold">Description</hi> The <hi rend="bold">search</hi> facility occurred to be intolerant to any spelling mistakes e.g. the search for "ericson" instead of "ericsson" gave no results. </item>
<item>
<hi rend="bold">Solution</hi> More tolerant search facility</item>
<item>
<hi rend="bold">Rationale</hi> It is very common to make a spelling mistake while typing. Search should find some spelling mistakes and suggest the correct spelling (like e.g. Google)</item>

<item>
<hi rend="bold">Solution</hi> The text should precisely fit the window so that is more visible. </item>
<item>
<hi rend="bold">Rationale</hi> It is easier for the user to see the whole text always if it is possible. In this case the amount of text is small enough to be shown at once. </item>
