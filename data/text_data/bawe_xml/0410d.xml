<p n="p2.44">
<s n="s1.3;p2.44">Despite the on-going controversy, the English legal position has moved forward by the enactment of the Abortion Act 1967 and the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p2.44">In general, the law allows abortion in specific circumstances, thus answering the First Question in the positive, while pragmatically addressing the Second Question by setting out certain statutory grounds. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p2.44">However, a closer examination of the English abortion law in the context of foetal disability reveals that the current law is fails to distinguish those circumstances satisfactorily. </s>

<p n="p5.44">
<s n="s1.3;p5.44">The pro-life camp tends to emphasize a right to life of the foetus and would claim that abortion should never be justified in law. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p5.44">The pro-lifer argument is that the foetus is a person and terminating pregnancy before its birth is equivalent to murder. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p5.44">Thus, abortion is morally wrong and should not be justified in law. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.44">
<s n="s1.3;p6.44">The pro-choice camp tends to stress a woman's right to choose and would claim that abortion should never be justified in law. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p6.44">Arguments drawn from a woman's right to autonomy, right to privacy and right to equality has been raised as support, such as the influential 'violinist argument' by Judith Jarvis Thomson<ref target="BAWE_0410d-ftnote.001"/>, which is an argument based on the right to autonomy. </s>

<s n="s2.3;p7.44">On one hand, the pro-life camp has been plagued by questions such as when life begins and English law is clear that the foetus has no legal status until it is born.<ref target="BAWE_0410d-ftnote.002"/> On the other, the pro-choice camp has disputed over which right is best to emphasize<ref target="BAWE_0410d-ftnote.003"/> and shows a lack of theoretical consensus. </s>
