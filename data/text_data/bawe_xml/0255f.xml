<p n="p1.17">
<s n="s1.10;p1.17">It appears that we can all succumb to a blurred and particular view of the past. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p1.17">Modern day prejudices can effect even the simplest discussion of history. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p1.17">There will be a conscious attempt here to provide an ultimately objective critique of the above statement made by Eamon de Valera in 1966. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p1.17">A reading of recent historical work concerning these two powerful characters provides a variety of opinions. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p1.17">Clearly, de Valera believed that Michael Collins' life and premature death secured him quasi martyrdom and a sympathetic remembrance. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p1.17">He may have felt that the fighter was more likely to be idolised than the politician. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p1.17">However, a theme central to this essay will be the discussion of whether the portrayal of Collins as simply a revolutionary soldier and freedom fighter is especially accurate. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p1.17">In any such investigation, it is important to outline the social, political and economic climate of the time and also to dissect the lives of the two men in order to understand the way they have been depicted in history. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p1.17">This essay will juxtapose historical commentaries of the lives of de Valera and Collins, while providing the political context within which both men worked. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p1.17">It will then be possible to remark upon the extent to which de Valera's comments made almost four decades ago have been corroborated by historiography. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.17">
<s n="s1.13;p2.17">In this assessment, and combined with an analysis of recent historiography, it is necessary to weigh up the political ambition, the political achievement and the mystique of both de Valera and Collins in order to comprehend their role in Irish history. </s>
<s n="s2.13;p2.17">It is quite possible that they realised a greatness and heroism that surpassed their concrete, quantifiable success, and it is the aim of this paper to discover how historians have recognised them and if this is congruent with de Valera's 1966 statement. </s>
<s n="s3.13;p2.17">Alvin Jackson believes that de Valera had all the qualities of a great man. </s>
<s n="s4.13;p2.17">He had the intellect, posture and charisma of an outstanding politician, and was 'the senior surviving officer of the Easter Rising', yet he is not renowned for his revolutionary tendencies. </s>
<s n="s5.13;p2.17">We can further add tribute to de Valera - the fact that he guided Ireland almost to complete independence from Westminster, a feat which had been the chief aim of nationalists and republicans for close to one hundred years. </s>
<s n="s6.13;p2.17">But, on a reading of recent historical work de Valera has failed to be remembered in a very positive light. </s>
<s n="s7.13;p2.17">It becomes imperative to pose the question, why? </s>
<s n="s8.13;p2.17">Jackson reminds us that 'it is easy to highlight the technical skills both of de Valera and his party: and it is dangerously easy to highlight their constitutional agenda to the detriment of other issues'.<ref target="BAWE_0255f-ftnote.001"/> However, Pauric Travers believes that 'de Valera ranks among the major figures of the twentieth century. </s>
<s n="s9.13;p2.17">Few other international politicians of comparable standing spent as long in the political limelight, even Winston Churchill, with whom he crossed swords on more than one occasion, appears something of a pygmy'.<ref target="BAWE_0255f-ftnote.002"/> Praise indeed, but it is apparent that not all historians feel the same way. </s>
<s n="s10.13;p2.17">Has de Valera therefore suffered as a result of political or social issues? </s>
<s n="s11.13;p2.17">Did his agenda not suit majority Irish opinion? </s>
<s n="s12.13;p2.17">Had Michael Collins achieved something that overshadowed what on paper appears to be nothing short of a magnificent political triumph? </s>
<s n="s13.13;p2.17">Or, in fact, is it unfair to suggest that de Valera has received an ill reputation amongst the majority of historians? </s>

<p n="p3.17">
<s n="s1.9;p3.17">In the political context, de Valera has been criticised for failing to provide much social reform and for lacking any real economic policy. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p3.17">It is possible to dismiss this criticism if it becomes apparent that he had absolutely no intent concerning social or economic reform. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p3.17">Considering what de Valera was trying to achieve it is impossible to amount this to his being politically inept. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p3.17">Jackson believes, and it is true, that de Valera's party, Fianna FÃ il, provided a relatively unsubstantial social policy and that 1930s Ireland was still rife with economic turbulence. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p3.17">The apparent protectionist zeal of Ireland at the time was born out of pragmatism, rather than the consequence of any higher ideology. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p3.17">Although, it could be said that the leaders of other nations, when faced with the great economic depression of the era, felt hard pressed to break free from the shackles of their <hi rend="italic">laissez-faire</hi> shibboleths, de Valera was a shrewd enough politician to recognise its benefits. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p3.17">That said, the Irish economy under de Valera made little progress and was still highly reliant upon British imports and the British market. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p3.17">Perhaps it is too easy with hindsight to deconstruct the economic strategy of a politician and party which was concerned with more pressing issues. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p3.17">In fact, 'the main focus of the attempted disengagement form Britain was not economic', since freedom form Britain was the primary aim of de Valera and Fianna FÃ il, surely it would be inappropriate to over criticise their lack of economic policy.<ref target="BAWE_0255f-ftnote.003"/> </s>

</note>
<p n="p4.17">
<s n="s1.6;p4.17">De Valera's number one political aspiration was the resolution of Irish independence, working within the framework of the 1922 Anglo-Irish Treaty, and in his 'first fifteen year administration, he had 'placed an indelible stamp on the self-image of twentieth century Ireland'.<ref target="BAWE_0255f-ftnote.004"/> We can therefore begin to concentrate on this element of his life in the public sphere, disregarding any more specific critique of his policy. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p4.17">It is to his credit that he pursued a new constitutional road to Irish self-determination; in any case the political climate of the 1930s would have proved to be a turbulent nemesis for radicalism in Ireland. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p4.17">Clearly, the domestic problems which occupied the attention of Westminster politicians at the time - most saliently, the Abdication Crisis and the increasing threat from Nazi Germany - were influential in terms of the ease in which concessions were made to Ireland, but the political manoeuvrings of de Valera made sure that 'it was also the case that they had little choice but to acquiesce'.<ref target="BAWE_0255f-ftnote.005"/> In the same way, it is true that British politicians had 'turned form mollifying the Taoiseach to the more intricate task of appeasing the FÃ¼hrer. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p4.17">Again, we can attribute triumph to de Valera and his Fianna FÃ il compatriots; it was they who had rejected militancy, preferring amicable negotiations which proved to be much more positive in their outcome. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p4.17">De Valera himself regarded the conciliation made by the British in 1938 as his most resounding political victory.<ref target="BAWE_0255f-ftnote.006"/> It was this Machiavellian intrigue within the boundaries of the Treaty which allowed it to be dismantled. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p4.17">Surely, such a profoundly successful strategy means that Eamon de Valera deserves a much more empathetic writing in history. </s>

<s n="s1.9;p5.17">Another accolade de Valera deserves is that he not achieved amicable concessions and diminished the threat of violence form Ireland, but he had elevated, in Neville Chamberlain's opinion, the Irish situation to the level of international diplomacy. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p5.17">As Jackson put it, de Valera had placed Ireland 'very firmly within the international context and as a series of interlocking diplomatic settlements forged between Britain and Italy and Germany'. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p5.17">This was a u-turn of previous policy that had somewhat sidelined the Irish situation. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p5.17">British politicians had become fearful of the threat of an Irish-German rapprochement. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p5.17">Britain's 'relatively weak bargaining position', was thoroughly, and rightly so, exploited by de Valera to its maximum.<ref target="BAWE_0255f-ftnote.007"/> On the other hand, Neville Chamberlain had quite admirably revealed 'that there [was] no time for keeping open old sores'. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p5.17">De Valera had galvanised a cordial relationship with British politicians on an unprecedented scale. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p5.17">Against any argument made concerning the flaws in the economic and social policy of Fianna FÃ il, one can point out that de Valera was ultimately prepared to 'sacrifice economic well-being in what he saw as the wider national interest'.<ref target="BAWE_0255f-ftnote.008"/> However, as Travers points out there were critics 'who challenged the hegemony of de Valera...and [also] radicals who rejected the narrowness of de Valera's vision and deplored the backwardness of the country he ruled'.<ref target="BAWE_0255f-ftnote.009"/> For the most part though, he had taken a completely acceptable and justifiable attitude at a time which was perfect to settle arguably the greatest problem Ireland had ever encountered, with the exception of the Great Famine. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p5.17">Economic, social, cultural and religious problems within Ireland could not be mended until Ireland had a government in place that represented the will of the majority. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p5.17">It is, therefore, futile to argue that de Valera had listed his priorities incorrectly. </s>

<s n="s1.12;p6.17">One of the trickiest periods Fianna FÃ il had to encounter was the Second World War. </s>
<s n="s2.12;p6.17">For many the securing of neutrality for Ireland ranked as one of de Valera's greatest achievements. </s>
<s n="s3.12;p6.17">Irish historians have tended to create an 'intricate and defensive' historiography of wartime Ireland. </s>
<s n="s4.12;p6.17">This is understandable; it was a complex fusion of political stratagems, with the main purpose being the maintenance of unity and symbolic rejection of British rule - it was also pretty widely accepted amongst Ireland's diverse population. </s>
<s n="s5.12;p6.17">It was at a time when de Valera had boosted his credentials. </s>
<s n="s6.12;p6.17">He was attacked for playing host to ministers from the Axis of Evil, yet managed to manoeuvre so that his reputation remained unscathed and that the cause of Irish nationalists emerged undamaged.<ref target="BAWE_0255f-ftnote.010"/> Post-bellum Ireland was cast in a similar mould to that of Britain. </s>
<s n="s7.12;p6.17">Fianna FÃ il embarked upon a relatively large scale social and economic welfare programme following the precedent of Beveridge and Keynes. </s>
<s n="s8.12;p6.17">However, throughout the 1940s the economic climate was never really bettered and de Valera's eventual downfall can be attributed to the realisation that the Irish economy was slipping even further behind the standard of other European nations. </s>
<s n="s9.12;p6.17">Fianna FÃ il was defeated in 1948, yet that defeat was 'long in coming and...narrow when it came'.<ref target="BAWE_0255f-ftnote.011"/> It is not surprising if we recognise Fianna FÃ il as being synonymous with 'a romance, spiced with republican chiliasm, cultural ideas, social reformation and personal loyalties forged through war or...through patronage'. </s>
<s n="s10.12;p6.17">De Valera had managed to strike a successful equilibrium between the quest for independence and eclectic political appeal. </s>
<s n="s11.12;p6.17">What is more was that at the time he was the embodiment and epitome of one hundred years of Irish sentiment, for many de Valera still remains the personification of Irish independence.<ref target="BAWE_0255f-ftnote.012"/> In February 1948, forty-two per cent of voters were still 'prepared to judge Fianna FÃ il on the basis of its creed rather than its record. </s>
<s n="s12.12;p6.17">This is the true measure of the party's success and of its leader's stature'.<ref target="BAWE_0255f-ftnote.013"/> It still remains to be seen then, why de Valera has been subjected in some intellectual circles to a critical historiography? </s>

<s n="s1.8;p7.17">Travers still believes that de Valera has a healthy reputation amongst most historians, however he does point out that for some he remained a 'divisive figure', and that there was a substantial number of Irish men and women who did not ally with his policy. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p7.17">Also, even the staunchest of republicans lost faith in de Valera as his expedience and pragmatism became superimposed over the nationalist principle. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p7.17">Perhaps, when he made that statement in 1966, suggesting that his critics would prevail in his writing into history, he was overtly conscious of the fact that expediency could not ensure him a legendary celebration. </s>

<s n="s3.11;p8.17">Prager believes that the 'modern state has to reflect the collective consensus of its constituency'. </s>
<s n="s4.11;p8.17">He says the split between Treatyite and Anti-Treatyite groups has deep cultural roots and is the manifestation of division between "Irish enlightenment values and norms", based on principles of the individual, democracy, consensus and parliamentary tradition, amongst others, as opposed to the culture of Gaelic romanticism which harbours Anti-Treatyite sentiment. </s>
<s n="s5.11;p8.17">The latter is fuelled by tradition, Anglophobia, republicanism and militarism to mention but a few. </s>
<s n="s6.11;p8.17">This goes a long way to explaining why some historians prefer to idealise the character traits of Collins which pertain to this model, ignoring the fact that he was also a moderate politician towards the end of his life, having realised the need to follow the route that de Valera eventually became allied with. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p8.17">The dominance of Fianna FÃ il in the early twentieth century was a consequence of being able, for the most part, to appeal to both these two strands of Irish political culture. </s>
