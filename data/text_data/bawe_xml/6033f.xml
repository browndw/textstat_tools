<s n="s1.4;p1.14">The following report is based on an assemblage of animal bones recovered from a British site no later than medieval in date. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p1.14">Each of the bones, or bone fragments, have been assessed and categorised into a table of results which highlights the main aspects of the bone fragments. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p1.14">This can in turn help to indicate the type of settlement and any practices going on there, for example husbandry. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p1.14">These results have then been compared with results from another assemblage to see any differences in types of animals and differences in aspects like ages and uses. </s>
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="underlined bold">Brief description:</head>
<p n="p2.14">
<s n="s1.5;p2.14">The assemblage investigated consisted of 48 fragments. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p2.14">Twenty-three of these were from sheep sized animals, eighteen from bovid, six from equus and one from a red deer. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p2.14">The bones are all in a relatively good condition, although nearly all have been subject to at least some weathering. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p2.14">18 of the fragments are identified to be adult, 10 are at least a sub-adult with 2 definite sub-adults, 4 juveniles and 16 unknowns. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p2.14">The unknown ages are due to insufficient remaining bone parts or un-ageable bones such as the scapula. </s>
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="underlined bold">Methods:</head>
<p n="p3.14">
<s n="s1.22;p3.14">Initially we would try to identify what part of the skeleton we were looking at. </s>
<s n="s2.22;p3.14">This was possible by comparing the bone to the images in our handbooks. </s>
<s n="s3.22;p3.14">There are also certain identifiable features on bones that made this easier. </s>
<s n="s4.22;p3.14">For example the head of bone which articulates with the socket on both the humerus and femur, or the distinctive shape of vertebrae. </s>
<s n="s5.22;p3.14">Often the shapes of the specific bones differ depending on the animal so the two identifications were then done simultaneously. </s>
<s n="s6.22;p3.14">Once the animal and bone type had been recognized we moved onto identifying other aspects such as age, side, proximal and distal fusion, pathology and weathering. </s>
<s n="s7.22;p3.14">The age of the animal was done on a broad basis. </s>
<s n="s8.22;p3.14">We know that the distal end of the bone is the first to fuse, followed by the proximal end. </s>
<s n="s9.22;p3.14">Using this information we could group the animals into juvenile, sub-adult or adult. </s>
<s n="s10.22;p3.14">For example, if all we had of a bone was the distal end and this was fused, we would know that it must be at least a sub-adult. </s>
<s n="s11.22;p3.14">Without the proximal end it is uncertain as to whether it is an adult. </s>
<s n="s12.22;p3.14">If only the proximal end was present and this was fused then we could assume that the distal end must also be fused and so it must be an adult. </s>
<s n="s13.22;p3.14">If either end were present and not fused we would know that it was a sub-adult (proximal un-fused) or juvenile (distal therefore both, un-fused). </s>
<s n="s14.22;p3.14">Distinctions such as the side of the bone were determined by comparing the bone with pictures in the handbook, as these were labeled left or right. </s>
<s n="s15.22;p3.14">To see any pathology that may be present we looked all over the bone to see any abnormalities, such as extra bone having been laid down. </s>
<s n="s16.22;p3.14">We had to be careful not to confuse this with weathering which could cause the bone to peel away or become scratched. </s>
<s n="s17.22;p3.14">Most of the bones had weathering on them, some were just discoloured but many had areas of bone broken away revealing the porous areas underneath. </s>
<s n="s18.22;p3.14">Butchery marks were seen on some of the bones. </s>
<s n="s19.22;p3.14">It was not always clear that the break was butchery by actually chopping the bone or if it had just been smashed. </s>
<s n="s20.22;p3.14">Furthermore, many of the bones had modern breaks which made it unclear whether the bone was broken or not. </s>
<s n="s21.22;p3.14">Modern breaks could be distinguished from old breaks by the colour of the bone on the cross section. </s>
<s n="s22.22;p3.14">If it was clean and a lot lighter than the rest of the bone then it is a modern break, as old breaks would discolour at the same rate as the rest of the bone. </s>

<head rend="underlined bold">Summary of data:</head>
<p n="p4.14">
<s n="s1.6;p4.14">By calculating the Minimum Number of Individuals (MNI) I found that there were a minimum of 4 sheep, 2 bovids, 2 equus and 1 deer in the assemblage. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p4.14">However, the Number of Individual Specimens (NISP) gave results of 23 sheep, 18 bovids, 6 equus and 1 deer. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p4.14">These results differ as the MNI is calculated by assuming that if there is a left, adult femur and another left, adult femur, this represents 2 individuals. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p4.14">But if there is one left, adult femur and another right, adult femur this represents only 1 individual as there is a possibility that they could be from the same animal. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p4.14">On the other hand, the NISP results are calculated on the assumption that each fragment is from a different individual. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p4.14">They both give the result that sheep dominate the assemblage. </s>

<p n="p5.14">
<s n="s1.4;p5.14">Figure 1 shows that the majority of the bovids in the assemblage were adults when they died, with 16.7% at least sub/adult. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p5.14">The sheep again show a majority of adults or at least sub/adults. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p5.14">However, there are also 17.4% juveniles represented, which is more than in other species. </s>

<p n="p6.14">
<s n="s1.5;p6.14">On 56% of the bovid bones there is evidence of possible butchery. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p6.14">This includes definite chop marks and snapped bones. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p6.14">Of the sheep 35% have evidence of possible butchery, with old snap marks and 1 definite, longitudinal chop mark. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p6.14">Of the 6 equus, 50% have what looks like butchery marks, with 1 of the 3 being a definite chop mark. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p6.14">However, these results may be skewed as many of the fragments have modern breaks which could mean the loss of evidence of old butchery marks. </s>

<div1 type="section">
<head rend="underlined bold">Discussion:</head>
<p n="p11.14">
<s n="s1.4;p11.14">These results indicate that assemblage A was more open to weathering than assemblage E. This could be due to soil differences speeding up the erosion of the fragments; some of the better preserved could have been covered and therefore shielded from environmental effects. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p11.14">Many of assemblage E showed signs of root weathering which may suggest that they were buried in an area with more tree or plant growth. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p11.14">Assemblage A may be older then assemblage E, causing greater signs of weathering. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p11.14">However, both assemblages were investigated by different people and so it could simply be a matter of differences of opinion in what is weathering or butchery, as assemblage A again shows greater signs of butchery than assemblage E. Although this could also be due to the two sites being used for different purposes. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.14">
<s n="s1.13;p12.14">The fact that both assemblages are dominated by adults (ignoring the unknown category from assemblage A) could indicate that the sites practiced animal husbandry. </s>
<s n="s2.13;p12.14">As the sex of the animals has not been determined in either assemblage, it is difficult to tell which sex has been kept to adulthood. </s>
<s n="s3.13;p12.14">If animal husbandry were being practiced we could expect to find the majority of adults to be female, with fewer male. </s>
<s n="s4.13;p12.14">We would also expect to find many juvenile bones as they would be killed so that the milk from the mother could be used. </s>
<s n="s5.13;p12.14">We only find this in the case of sheep. </s>
<s n="s6.13;p12.14">This could be indicative of sheep being kept in breeding for meat and the older animals being kept for their wool. </s>
<s n="s7.13;p12.14">Traction is another use for bovids, which could explain the lack of juvenile bones being found. </s>
<s n="s8.13;p12.14">However it could be that these remains have been lost due to taphonomical processes, scattering or even having been lost since recovery at the site. </s>
<s n="s9.13;p12.14">This is because juvenile bones have yet to fuse and are therefore made up of several small bones and are less identifiable. </s>
<s n="s10.13;p12.14">Furthermore, the assemblages may have been analysed differently to one another, providing different results where they might not really exist. </s>
<s n="s11.13;p12.14">The equus in the assemblages are all at least sub/adult, with the majority being adults. </s>
<s n="s12.13;p12.14">This is what you would expect to see when the equus are being used for traction. </s>
<s n="s13.13;p12.14">The sus are both sub-adults, which is consistent with them being used as meat, since when they are juveniles they are too small and you wouldn't want the meat old. </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.14">
<s n="s1.7;p13.14">The bones broken longitudinally may have been broken this way in order to extract marrow. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p13.14">However, this could also just be the way they snapped. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p13.14">It is sometimes easy to see where bones have been subjected to definite butchery. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p13.14">This can be seen when there is a clean cut, often with an area sticking out at the bottom where the sawing has stopped and the bone has snapped free under its own weight. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p13.14">In most cases the bone appears to have been broken, with no clean cut from sawing or shopping. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p13.14">This may be when the bone has been smashed to shatter the bone in many places and get the meat off. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p13.14">The modern breaks on bones may have broken off parts which indicate butchery, which may have given skewed results. </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.14">
<s n="s1.2;p14.14">Both sites seem to show largely the same results, with a majority of young adult or adult animals. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p14.14">Animal husbandry may have been being practiced along with other usual uses such as traction, food and wool. </s>
