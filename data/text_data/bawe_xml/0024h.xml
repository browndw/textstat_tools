With infinite complacency men went to and fro over this globe about their little affairs, serene in their assurance of their empire over matter. Yet across the gulf of space, minds that are to our minds immeasurably superior to ours, regarded this earth with envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their plans against us.

<s n="s1.5;p12.29">I think the pace of the film is interesting. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p12.29">There is a consistent sense throughout that we are moving at walking pace, rather than driving, despite much of the action taking place within the car. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p12.29">This not only clarifies the feeling of senseless repetition but further emphasises the need explored in the film to step away from the rush of the city centre (skirting the primary issue as it were) in order to make discoveries, not only of the M25 but of London itself by looking closer and opening up the secrets harboured around the metropolis. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p12.29">Part of its process of presenting an instructive vision of the early twenty-first century metropolis is the film's ability to offer the audience a new perspective of looking closer at the M25. </s>
