<s n="s1.10;p1.10">Human rights atrocities have become a focal point in this global era through the many egregious acts committed by individuals over the past few decades. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p1.10">These violations of humanity have taken place in various locations such as Cambodia, Rwanda, Yugoslavia, Sierra Leone, Iraq and the list goes on. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p1.10">Attached to the commission of these horrific acts is the notion of responsibility--individual criminal responsibility. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p1.10">As such international criminal law intervenes by initiating the legal processes of investigation, prosecution, trial, judgment and punishment in relation to an individual's perpetration of international crimes: war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and crimes of aggression. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p1.10">These different processes are clearly embodied in the International Criminal Court (ICC). </s>
<s n="s6.10;p1.10">Furthermore the investigation process is readily apparent from the Chief Prosecutor's communication concerning Iraq. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p1.10">The latter process reflects the factual, legal and procedural aspects in establishing the role of individuals accused of serious crimes. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p1.10">However the various legal processes are equally found in the national courts. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p1.10">Therefore individuals can also be held accountable for the commission of very serious crimes through the principles of jurisdiction and complementarity. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p1.10">As such the weaknesses of the ICC (as reflected in the Chief Prosecutor's communication) in relation to the definition of international crimes, and subjective thresholds such as gravity and proportionality do not pose a major threat to international criminal law because of the opportunities for domestic prosecutions. </s>

<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">Genocide and Crimes against Humanity</head>
<p n="p2.10">
<s n="s1.13;p2.10">The establishment of genocide and crimes against humanity require fulfilment of the definitions in Articles 6 and 7 of the Rome Statute respectively. </s>
<s n="s2.13;p2.10">The crime of genocide requires specific intent that is targeted at particular groups of individuals as listed in Article 6 of the Rome Statute. </s>
<s n="s3.13;p2.10">This requirement sets a rather high level of intent and thus not every harmful act perpetrated will fall into the category of genocide. </s>
<s n="s4.13;p2.10">The essential elements are the numbers and specificity. </s>
<s n="s5.13;p2.10">This fact is highlighted in the Chief Prosecutor's communication concerning the situation in Iraq. </s>
<s n="s6.13;p2.10">Although "genocide remains a central conceptual component of international criminal law..." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0312i-ftnote.001"/>
<s n="s7.13;p2.10">certain factual and procedural aspects have to be satisfied before a thorough investigation procedure. </s>
<s n="s8.13;p2.10">This may be considered a hindrance to a further development of genocide if what is essentially required are statistics and pedantry. </s>
<s n="s9.13;p2.10">But of course it is arguable that these are exactly the components that lend to the legitimacy of international criminal law because of the notion of adherence to the rules. </s>
<s n="s10.13;p2.10">Furthermore international criminal law is concerned with the prosecution of individuals who have not adhered to the rules of the international community. </s>
<s n="s11.13;p2.10">The communication also raises the issue of the defining elements in relation to crimes against humanity (Article 7 of the Rome Statute). </s>
<s n="s12.13;p2.10">So long as the required elements attached to crimes against humanity cannot be satisfied a further investigation cannot occur. </s>
<s n="s13.13;p2.10">Hence it is clear that adherence is the key. </s>

<head rend="bold">Crime of Aggression</head>
<p n="p3.10">
<s n="s1.17;p3.10">The crime of aggression has regrettably not been defined in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court because of power politics rather than a lack of consensus over definition. </s>
<s n="s2.17;p3.10">The development of a definition of this particular crime has been slow but steady ever since its inception at Nuremberg. </s>
<s n="s3.17;p3.10">Indeed Shukri observes that "over fifty years ago, it was authoritatively held by the International Military Tribunal (IMT) at Nuremberg that initiating a war of aggression was the supreme international crime." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0312i-ftnote.002"/>
<s n="s4.17;p3.10">Therefore there is no question that the crime of aggression is a reprehensible act. </s>
<s n="s5.17;p3.10">There has been unanimity regarding only one aspect of definition and this was highlighted in the article by Antonio Yáñez-Barnuevo<ref target="BAWE_0312i-ftnote.003"/>. </s>
<s n="s6.17;p3.10">The author observes the final comments by the coordinator Silvia Fernández de Gurmendi that aggression is essentially a "leadership crime". </s>
<s n="s7.17;p3.10">With the guidance of both the definitions in the IMT and General Assembly Resolution 3314 (XXIX) with respect to the crime of aggression, it is then clear that the real impediment is the power struggle between the ICC and the Security Council. </s>
<s n="s8.17;p3.10">This fact has been elucidated by many jurists and commentators. </s>
<s n="s9.17;p3.10">This certainly does not bode well for the future of international criminal law because of the fear of politicization. </s>
<s n="s10.17;p3.10">But Lehto argues that "there may, in fact, be some legitimate overlap between the political and judicial functions..." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0312i-ftnote.004"/>
<s n="s11.17;p3.10">of the ICC. This statement illustrates a realistic and practical approach to the role of the ICC. The ICC itself was founded mainly through the efforts of the United Nations General Assembly; the latter comprised of States with their own political views. </s>
<s n="s12.17;p3.10">Indeed international criminal law will perform better with the realisation that it can never be wholly divorced from politics. </s>
<s n="s13.17;p3.10">Any attempt will be futile. </s>
<s n="s14.17;p3.10">However realisation and acceptance are two different matters. </s>
<s n="s15.17;p3.10">The development of international criminal law should not be hampered by the acceptance of power politics as a justification for a delayed definition. </s>
<s n="s16.17;p3.10">Ergo how long before the ICC can invoke its jurisdiction to try leaders for the crime of aggression? </s>
<s n="s17.17;p3.10">This concern is clearly highlighted in the Chief Prosecutor's communication regarding Iraq but the solution remains to be seen. </s>

<head rend="bold">Civilian Issues in War Crimes </head>
<p n="p4.10">
<s n="s1.4;p4.10">The analysis of civilian issues in war crimes will be sub-divided into two separate categories: (a) proportionality, and (b) the use of weaponry. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p4.10">In the Chief Prosecutor's communication, Article 8(2)(b)(i) and Article 8(2)(b)(iv) were specifically mentioned. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p4.10">These articles deal with the civilian population. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p4.10">They are of much importance in understanding how the aforementioned categories are interpreted within the context of international criminal law. </s>
</p>
<div2>
<head>Proportionality</head>
<p n="p5.10">
<s n="s1.13;p5.10">This term means that "the commander must be able reasonably to foresee, before launching the attack on a target, its military utility, the likely civilian casualties and whether the latter would be excessive." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0312i-ftnote.005"/>
<s n="s2.13;p5.10">As such there are many factual considerations to be taken into account in determining whether an attack is deemed proportionate. </s>
<s n="s3.13;p5.10">It is apparent that this term is a subjective concept because of the numerous value judgements and "the inherent difficulty of valuation"<ref target="BAWE_0312i-ftnote.006"/>. </s>
<s n="s4.13;p5.10">Thus it is a malleable concept that is susceptible to influences especially by the military commanders, who have to determine whether a planned attack is proportionate. </s>
<s n="s5.13;p5.10">International criminal law is therefore plagued with uncertainties and ambiguities which affects its credibility as a system of justice. </s>
<s n="s6.13;p5.10">Indeed many commentators have expressed their regret at the Final Report to the Prosecutor by the Committee Established to Review the NATO Bombing Campaign against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. </s>
<s n="s7.13;p5.10">This Report illustrates an optimistic or rather biased view that a 'reasonable military commander'<ref target="BAWE_0312i-ftnote.007"/> will be able to ascertain whether the injury to civilians is clearly disproportionate. </s>
<s n="s8.13;p5.10">This view is debatable since the ultimate goal of a military commander is to secure a military advantage, and collateral damage is thus to be expected. </s>
<s n="s9.13;p5.10">The term 'collateral damage' often appears in the law of international armed conflict and is arguably a term abused by military commanders. </s>
<s n="s10.13;p5.10">Thereby the interpretation of proportionality will always differ between that of the military commanders and the civilians themselves. </s>
<s n="s11.13;p5.10">Ironically this fact is acknowledged in the aforementioned Report but deference will ultimately be to military commanders. </s>
<s n="s12.13;p5.10">Therefore the actions of military commanders are unlikely to satisfy the requirements of Article 8(2)(b)(i) and Article 8(2)(b)(iv); as long as they are able to continually justify their decisions on the ground that it was proportionate. </s>
<s n="s13.13;p5.10">Therefore there may never be justice for injured civilians even with the establishment of international criminal law as a system of prosecution in these cases. </s>

<head>the Use of Weaponry</head>
<p n="p6.10">
<s n="s1.17;p6.10">The prohibition of the use of specific weapons in the Rome Statute of the ICC is predicated upon the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949. </s>
<s n="s2.17;p6.10">Hence the list of specified weapons and other methods of warfare are rather outdated since they reflect the technology which was employed during that particular time period. </s>
<s n="s3.17;p6.10">As a result of this antiquated approach many modern weapons such as cluster munitions and nuclear weapons have failed to be classified as prohibited weapons in the ICC. Advocates for the prohibition of cluster munitions and nuclear weapons have asserted that these weapons are indiscriminate in nature and cannot distinguish between civilians and military objects. </s>
<s n="s4.17;p6.10">Indiscriminate attacks are defined in Article 51(4)(a) to (c) of the Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions 1949.<ref target="BAWE_0312i-ftnote.008"/> However military commanders and State officials often assert that these weapons are often able to discriminate even though there may be occasional failures. </s>
<s n="s5.17;p6.10">This argument is clearly highlighted in the Communication. </s>
<s n="s6.17;p6.10">Even the Chief Prosecutor acknowledges the statement released by the UK Ministry of Defence that "nearly 85% of weapons released by UK were precision-guided, a figure which would tend to corroborate effort to minimize casualties." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0312i-ftnote.009"/>
<s n="s7.17;p6.10">This means that there is essentially a sliding scale or balancing act in weighing the failures and successes of the use of weapons. </s>
<s n="s8.17;p6.10">Has international criminal law thus been reduced to a lesson in arithmetic? </s>
<s n="s9.17;p6.10">Surely the law is concerned with legal considerations rather than factual and mathematical approaches. </s>
<s n="s10.17;p6.10">As such it is the role of international criminal law to campaign for a more legalistic approach which acknowledges the reality; the reality is that cluster munitions and nuclear weapons produce far more damage and long-lasting effects than some of the prohibited weapons. </s>
<s n="s11.17;p6.10">There has at least been a slight progress in recent times, for example Norway's call for a treaty to ban cluster munitions. </s>
<s n="s12.17;p6.10">There is yet hope. </s>
<s n="s13.17;p6.10">This sentiment is reflected in the statement by Steve Goose (director of the arms division at Human Rights Watch), "this is a watershed moment in the international effort to combat cluster munitions. </s>
<s n="s14.17;p6.10">Any country serious about protecting civilians from the horrible effects of cluster munitions will join the Norwegian-led initiative right away." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0312i-ftnote.010"/>
<s n="s15.17;p6.10">Therefore if cluster munitions were included in the list of prohibited weapons in the Rome Statute; there would be individual responsibility for those individuals who employ these weapons through prosecution and sanctions. </s>
<s n="s16.17;p6.10">As such this outcome would provide at least some sort of recognition with respect to the suffering of civilians. </s>
<s n="s17.17;p6.10">Furthermore this would satisfy the notion of "international criminal law [as] a body of international rules designed both to proscribe international crimes and to impose upon States the obligation to prosecute and punish at least some of those crimes."<ref target="BAWE_0312i-ftnote.011"/> </s>
