<s n="s2.3;p1.10">It is needed to share information, ideas, and opinions, which are required to organise individuals, teams and ultimately the company. </s>

<p n="p2.10">
<s n="s1.6;p2.10">All communication, whatever the form, has the same objectives. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p2.10">These begin with receiving the information presented, which sees that everyone has the information or data required for them to carry out their tasks. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p2.10">The information then needs to be understood, so it can be used effectively. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p2.10">Next is for the information to be accepted, ensuring that the information will not be discarded and will be considered useful. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p2.10">Then finally for action on the information to be undertaken, which is the ultimate aim of communicating. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p3.10">Communication can be either verbal or non-verbal. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p3.10">Verbal communication involves the skills of speaking and listening. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p3.10">Good speaking skills require a clear voice, correct tone and smooth delivery. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p3.10">A speaker must connect with their audience to encourage mutual interest in their topic. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p3.10">Some of the key qualities a good speaker should have are alertness, pleasantness, distinctiveness and expressiveness.<ref target="BAWE_0388c-endnote.001"/> Alertness shows interest in the audience, making the audience more inclined to listen. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p3.10">Pleasantness will encourage cooperation and distinctiveness will ensure that the speaker's message is understood. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p3.10">Finally expressiveness conveys personal interest in the topic, which will stir interest from the audience. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p5.10">Non-verbal communication mostly consists of body language. </s>

<s n="s3.6;p5.10">These factors can be useful in adding depth to what is already being spoken, however, they must be used appropriately. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p5.10">For example, good eye contact can show interest in the audience, which can increase participation. </s>

<s n="s3.14;p6.10">Meetings are required to pool information, which in turn allows for informed decision-making. </s>
<s n="s4.14;p6.10">Within AstraZeneca meetings occur regularly, each with its own aim and agenda. </s>
<s n="s5.14;p6.10">These occur throughout the hierarchy of the company, from one-to-one meetings between an employee and their manager to executive board meetings. </s>
<s n="s6.14;p6.10">Some meetings provide information, some provide decisions and some provide both. </s>
<s n="s7.14;p6.10">For example, departmental meetings involve whole departments to deliver information about company and departmental performance and future targets. </s>
<s n="s8.14;p6.10">Project presentation meetings present the work of a team on a certain project, providing useful tips and points that can be applied to other projects. </s>
<s n="s9.14;p6.10">These information-providing meetings are important in maintaining workforce morale, as they incite a feeling of being included. </s>
<s n="s10.14;p6.10">Meetings also occur at periodic intervals throughout the project to discuss its future. </s>
<s n="s11.14;p6.10">This usually involves senior management as it can have major implications for the company. </s>
<s n="s12.14;p6.10">These meetings share some information but are primarily for decision-making. </s>
<s n="s13.14;p6.10">They can decide whether a project should proceed to the next stage of development, or if it has reached the end of its lifespan. </s>
<s n="s14.14;p6.10">These decisions rely on many different pieces of information from various departments, so a well-informed decision can only be made by the group in collaboration, rather than by an individual. </s>
