Subject to the rights of the these institutions in the BAWE corpus, and pursuant to the ESRC agreement, the BAWE corpus is available to researchers for research purposes PROVIDED THAT the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>1. The corpus files are not distributed in either their original form or in modified form.</p>
<p>2. The texts are used for research purposes only; they should not be reproduced in teaching materials.</p>
<p>3. The texts are not reproduced in full for a wider audience/readership, although researchers are free to quote short passages of text (up to 200 running words from any given text).</p>
<p>4. The BAWE corpus developers (contact: BAWE@warwick.ac.uk) are informed of all projects, dissertations, theses, presentations or publications arising from analysis of the corpus.</p>

<s n="s1.1;p2.9">There are many ways in which it can be shown that children aren't taught language whereas they are reading and writing. </s>

<p n="p3.9">
<s n="s1.2;p3.9">Children are supplied with both informal and formal tuition in the reading and writing systems. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p3.9">By the time children reach school age they are likely to have received some form of informal teaching of reading and writing from parents which as Crystal notes, is often in the form of a colourful alphabet book bought for the child by relatives.<ref target="BAWE_6018d-ftnote.001"/> Whatever the source though, the point is; even by the time the child reaches school age they have received some form of teaching regarding reading and writing. </s>

<s n="s1.1;p4.9">At school this obviously increases to formal teaching and schools are legally required to teach children reading and writing. </s>

<p n="p5.9">
<s n="s1.1;p5.9">There can be no doubt therefore that children are taught to read and write - it is a simple fact. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.9">
<s n="s1.5;p6.9">We can now turn to look then at whether children are taught to speak. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p6.9">The answer is no, at least not in any formal way. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p6.9">By the time children start to attend school they are expected to be able to speak showing that children have learnt to speak without formal teaching. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p6.9">It has been argued that children learn to speak through imitating adults, which could be considered a form of indirect teaching. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p6.9">However the existence of virtuous errors where children produce utterances they couldn't have heard have disproved this idea. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.9">
<s n="s1.1;p7.9">Chomsky's idea of innateness and that children have a Language Acquisition Device and are as such are "genetically 'prewired' to acquire language"<ref target="BAWE_6018d-ftnote.002"/> lends credence to the idea that children aren't taught language but instead acquire it naturally. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p8.9">One example that also helps support the idea is that of the silent kids of Nicaragua. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p8.9">These were deaf children who had no language. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p8.9">Instead they simply created their own (with signs as the equivalent of spoken language). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p8.9">The fact that in places where there is no language, a language can be created also shows that spoken language is not taught. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.9">
<s n="s1.8;p9.9">The main issue here can be simplified into one short question; "without teaching, would spoken and written language exist?" </s>
<s n="s2.8;p9.9">In the case of spoken language we can see that the answer is yes, in extreme cases like that of Nicaragua a new spoken language can be created therefore without any teaching. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p9.9">In the case of more mundane everyday life we can observe that spoken language is acquired by children before they start formal schooling. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p9.9">Informal teaching through imitation is not enough to teach a child to speak (as we have seen, imitation theory simply doesn't stand up to close scrutiny) and hence children must acquire speech reasonably naturally. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p9.9">For written language on the other hand, the answer is the opposite. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p9.9">Without specific teaching, it does not exist. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p9.9">Many languages for instance have no written form. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p9.9">We can therefore conclude that children's reading and writing has to be taught in contrast to their speech. </s>
