<s n="s4.4;p60.63">Although the model does not consider collisions to be with lattice ions, it would be far more suitable or the collision frequency related variable to be <formula notation="" id="BAWE_0306f-form.052"/> which is a constant for a given system. </s>

<p n="p61.63">
<s n="s1.3;p61.63">The classical "<hi rend="italic">Drude</hi>" model and the equivalent "<hi rend="italic">Sommerfeld</hi>" (without scattering effects) prove well the linear dependence of the macroscopic Ohm's Law, although the addition of the Exclusion Principle in the quantum picture distorts this slightly. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p61.63">Although the elastic and inelastic scattering introduced by "<hi rend="italic">Sommerfeld</hi>" fails in this are, it generally increases the accuracy of the Free Electron Model in metals. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p61.63">The cooling effects of inelastic scattering, and the lack of this cooling in the case of elastic scattering helps to provide a better picture of electron collisions with lattice ions, but still lacks consideration of impurities and other vibrations that occur in real metals. </s>
</p>
<p n="p62.63">
<s n="s1.2;p62.63">For the cases of combined electric and magnetic fields, the simple relationship explanation of the Hall Angle is approached ideally in both models, due to the simple geometry considered. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p62.63">But Both Drude and Sommerfeld fail to account for the existence of positive charge carriers in certain metals and hence magnetoresistance, and leading to only certain polarisations of fields allowed when later considering the cyclotron frequency. </s>

<s n="s2.3;p63.63">The fact that "<hi rend="italic">Drude</hi>" is based upon entirely classical principles almost guarantees its failure in areas that have already been proven with deeper quantum exploration. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p63.63">As "<hi rend="italic">Sommerfeld</hi>" attempts to take some of the most basic quantum ideas into account it ultimately improves the model, despite using the same unrealistic parameters. </s>
