<head rend="underlined">Conclusions</head>
<p n="p34.47">
<s n="s1.2;p34.47">For unchlorinated water entering a distribution system to be considered satisfactory no <hi rend="italic">E. coli</hi> should be detected in 100 ml. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p34.47">If <hi rend="italic">E. coli</hi> is absent, the occasional presence of up to 3 coliform bacteria/100 ml may be tolerated. </s>
</p>
<p n="p35.47">
<s n="s1.4;p35.47">In the multiple tube method, it is assumed that the organisms are distributed randomly throughout the sample and there must be at least one cell for growth to occur. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p35.47">Some tubes turned turbid which showed that there were at least one cell grew in those tubes. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p35.47">The most probable number (MPN) of coliform bacteria/100 ml original sample is 12. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p35.47">That meant the water is considered unsatisfactory. </s>
</p>
<p n="p36.47">
<s n="s1.4;p36.47">From the membrane filtration, 5 colonies/100 ml water sample of <hi rend="italic">E. coli</hi> were found. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p36.47">This indicated the presence of faecal contamination. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p36.47">Actually, there is no absolute correlation between the number of indicator organisms and the actual presence or numbers of enteric pathogens, nor between the risk of illness occurring and the numbers of organisms present in a given sample. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p36.47">The finding of coliforms bacteria and <hi rend="italic">E. coli</hi> indicates and thus a potentially dangerous situation. </s>
</p>
<p n="p37.47">
<s n="s1.3;p37.47">7 colonies /100 ml water sample of coliform bacteria are found in the sample from the membrane filtration. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p37.47">The presence of coliform bacteria indicated faecal pollution of water. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p37.47">As the number of colonies were greater than 3/100 ml, the water supply is considered unsatisfactory. </s>
</p>
<p n="p38.47">
<s n="s1.5;p38.47">The plates for the general viable count incubated at 37 <hi rend="sup">o</hi>C for 24 h were used to examine the presence of bacteria and were presumed animal derived. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p38.47">The number of colonies found in both original and 10 <hi rend="sup">-2</hi> dilution were the same. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p38.47">Thus the colonies counted for 10 <hi rend="sup">-2</hi> dilution was probably due to contamination. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p38.47">The plates for the general viable count incubated at 22 <hi rend="sup">o</hi>C for 3 d were used to examine the presence of the micro-flora in the whole nature and so the number of colony presence would be larger. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p38.47">The number of colony was 380 cfu/ml which appeared quite high. </s>
</p>
<p n="p39.47">
<s n="s1.5;p39.47">There may be errors in this experiment. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p39.47">It was hard to judge the turbidity by naked eyes. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p39.47">False positive reactions may occur in the multiple tube dilutions due to the growth of aerobic and anaerobic organisms. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p39.47">The MPN technique is generally regarded as being inaccurate because it employs a statistical basis for calculating the numbers of organisms present in an examined sample. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p39.47">However, it is more sensitive than the colony count in agar plate method when only low numbers of organisms are present. </s>
</p>
<p n="p40.47">
<s n="s1.6;p40.47">Membrane filtration was the best method among the three to examine bacteria in water in this experiment. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p40.47">Results can be obtained as direct counts within a short time. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p40.47">In industry, a fast result enables a quicker response to be made with respect to the remedial action that may be required. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p40.47">There was considerable saving in the amount of media and glassware required compared to other methods. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p40.47">However, there are still limitations associated. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p40.47">Membranes are unsuitable for water sample of high turbidity as the membrane will be blocked and the accumulated deposit on the membrane may inhibit the growth of indicator organisms. </s>
</p>
<p n="p41.47">
<s n="s1.2;p41.47">Water is essential for life. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p41.47">Frequent examination of water is crucial to maintain the quality and hence to reduce risk of infections diseases. </s>
