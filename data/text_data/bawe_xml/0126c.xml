<div1 type="section">
<p n="p1.15">
<s n="s1.5;p1.15">At the start of his literary career Clare had forged for himself the poetic identity of the 'Northamptonshire peasant poet.' </s>
<s n="s2.5;p1.15">It was a persona that bestowed its author with celebrity status and was also a principle factor in the popularity of his collections. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p1.15">'The Badger' was written when public fascination with the labourer-poet had begun to wane. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p1.15">A series of increasingly diminutive returns from his publications and imminent detention at a sanatorium were events that vitally contextualise the poem. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p1.15">Clare constructs 'The Badger' around the struggles of it's eponymous protagonist, and the badger itself suggests possible commensuration with both the author and the labouring classes to which Clare belonged. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.15">
<s n="s1.4;p2.15">This is the central interpretive dilemma of the poem: should we read 'The Badger' as political allegory or personal biography? </s>
<s n="s2.4;p2.15">The poem can be viewed primarily as a metaphor of rural displacement; the badger emblematic of a countryside Everyman expatriated from his natural surroundings and forced into the violent competition of the towns. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p2.15">The consequence is either death or servitude, the "baited badger" (l.55) of the final stanza symbolic of the country-folk assimilated into an urban regime and relegated to menial social function. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p2.15">Once able to "fight with dogs for hours and beat them all" (l.36), the badger's status to his opponents is now rendered in imitative terms: the repetition of the simile "like a dog" (l.56, l.66) emphasises the descent from the independent to the servile. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.15">
<s n="s1.4;p3.15">Yet Clare is not presented as an exterior persona. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p3.15">This suggests that the poet saw himself as synonymous with the badger of the poem, and indeed there are many parallels. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p3.15">Clare was perceived at large as a genuine Wordsworthian poet: one who wrote from a "spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings" but who lacked the intellectual aptitude bestowed by education and upbringing to write poetry of appealing sophistication. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p3.15">'The Badger' is partly an expression of Clare's increasing sense of frustration at the complacent marginalisation of his work by the wider public. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.15">
<s n="s1.8;p4.15">Both interpretations emphasise the conflict between the public and private: the spheres of nature and the solitary individual are incongruent with the crowded "noisey streets" (l.28) of the new industrial towns. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p4.15">The first stanza emphasises Clare's idealisation of natural solitude. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p4.15">The lumbering badger, "awkard" (l.5) and "grunting" (l.1) is analogous to the romantic notion of an isolated poetic wanderer, akin to the author himself. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p4.15">Clare's poetry was, after all, the product of lonely self-immersion in his natural surroundings. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p4.15">The badger is strangely anthropomorphised (indeed, throughout the poem he will increasingly appropriate human characteristics: in later stanzas the badger "grins" (l.40) and "cackles" (l.54)) and vaguely geriatric: groups of human boys provide the antithesis to his character. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p4.15">They beat and kill him for amusement. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p4.15">Their pleasure in destruction will later extend to burning the forest, which the badger enjoys a symbiotic relationship with. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p4.15">With his "nose on the ground" (l.5) he </s>
</p>
<quote lang="English">
<hi rend="italic">"Roots in the bushes and the woods and makes A great high burrow in the ferns and brakes"</hi> (ll.3-4)</quote>
<p n="p5.15">
<s n="s1.3;p5.15">. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p5.15">The badger lives in harmonious accord with nature, a notion the last stanza expounds further. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p5.15">Where we previously saw the badger's cheerful coexistence with the woods in which he resides, the tamed badger featured in the last stanza </s>
</p>
<quote lang="English">
<hi rend="italic">"runs away from noise in hollow trees Burnt by the boys to get a swarm of bees"</hi> (ll.67-68)</quote>
<p n="p6.15">
<s n="s1.3;p6.15">. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p6.15">This subsequent destructive isolation from his natural habitat illustrates a shared mutual imperative: both badger and wood must be together. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p6.15">To separate them is anathema. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.15">
<s n="s1.1;p7.15">With no authorial persona, the poem's viewpoint oscillates between the individual </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.15">
<s n="s1.3;p8.15">badger and the larger human collective in the town (though Clare's sympathies are easily identifiable with the benign placidity of the singular animal compared to the urban mob.) </s>
<s n="s2.3;p8.15">Human activity is heralded by noise: aural disruption accompanies the badger's capture. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p8.15">The men "laugh and shout and fright the scampering hogs" (l.26), who enter the town to a deafening cacophony: the residents </s>
</p>
<quote lang="English">
<hi rend="italic">"shout and hullo down the noisey streets He turns about to face the loud uproar"</hi> (ll.28-29)</quote>
<p n="p9.15">
<s n="s1.5;p9.15">. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p9.15">Urban life is characterised by loud and abrasive sound: "the drunkard swears" (l.42), the "blackguard laughs" (1.44), dogs bark "in noises loud" (l.48). </s>
<s n="s3.5;p9.15">Clare's social group is a conglomerate of drunks, villains and aggressive animals. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p9.15">In contrast the badger is singular and silent, only incoherently articulating a cackle and groan at his death. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p9.15">The badger is bereft of a voice in a community that regards him as an alien and temporal focus of its amusement: one feels the resonances here are with Clare specifically. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.15">
<s n="s1.6;p10.15">The death of the badger should provide some sort of poetic resolution; the poem's climax and subsequent end. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p10.15">However, the poem's ballad form and unusual structure seem conflicting. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p10.15">The staple ballad relies on the briefest of exposition followed with succinct conclusion, yet the lengthy epilogue that constitutes the last stanza contradicts such conventions. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p10.15">Though the direct opening and swift narrative sequence of 'The Badger' lead naturally to the death of it's protagonist, structurally this is not the poem's centre. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p10.15">Counting the lines of the five stanzas reveals two sections of fourteen and twelve lines arranged around a centre stanza of sixteen lines (the midpoint of which is line 34). </s>
<s n="s6.6;p10.15">Numerically the stanza's resemble a simple palindrome: 14-12-16-12-14. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.15">
<s n="s1.4;p11.15">Clare's mirroring and repetition occur (with far less coherency) on the micro level: between lines (the AABB rhyming couplet offering a simplistic example) and between stanzas or fragments of stanzas. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p11.15">The capture of the wild badger (ll. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p11.15">24-26) closely resembles the taming of the badger in the fifth stanza (ll.55-56). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p11.15">Fragments of the fifth stanza also closely resemble: </s>
</p>
<quote lang="English">
<hi rend="italic">"They urge him on like dogs and show fair play He beats and scarcely wounded goes away"</hi> (ll.57-58)</quote>
<quote lang="English">
<hi rend="italic">"He licks the patting hand and trys to play And never tries to bite or run away"</hi> (ll.65-66)</quote>
<p n="p12.15">
<s n="s1.8;p12.15">There is a transformation, however, that occurs between these reflected lines. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p12.15">Once we return to the themes of play and departure discussed at the start of the stanza, it is clear that the badger has changed. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p12.15">He no longer fights, he shows affection to his masters. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p12.15">He no longer leaves, instead "he scorns to fly" (l.59). </s>
<s n="s5.8;p12.15">Similarly, in the previous example the captured badger is presented as distinct from the dogs that hound him. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p12.15">The baited badger, no longer wild and unruly, "follows like a dog." </s>
<s n="s7.8;p12.15">The emphasis here has shifted: the badger is not pursued by dogs unwillingly, he himself obediently tags behind. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p12.15">The resulting anti-climax is unnerving: the death of the previous badger has been undermined by the tame badger's complacent capitulation to a human master. </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.15">
<s n="s1.7;p13.15">Yet if the lengthy epilogue and the poem's structure contribute towards the bathos at the poem's end, then where is the poetic climax shifted? </s>
<s n="s2.7;p13.15">Punctuation in its absence fosters a constant build throughout. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p13.15">'The Badger' is instead relying on the conjunctive "and" to punctuate sentences. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p13.15">Each line stumbles awkwardly into the next without halt, reflecting the persistent race motif (l.6, l.45): the reader is given little chance to stop. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p13.15">Similarly, the iambic pentameter of the poem lends 'The Badger' a swift and constant rhythm that complements the constant build. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p13.15">Incremental repetition combines with the lack of punctuation to create a dramatic crescendo: the badger defeats innumerable combatants and drives the crowd back on four separate occasions (ll.30, 41, 47, 49). </s>
<s n="s7.7;p13.15">Each juncture effects a successive build in tension. </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.15">
<s n="s1.4;p14.15">The escalating violence of the poem's latter half seems to be catalysed by the exact middle line of the poem. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p14.15">Indeed, the line "The badger turns and drives them all away" (l.34) becomes both a literary and actual turning point: this is effectively the poem's Volta, and the revelation of the badger's physical strength transforms him from an object of awkward ridicule to a fearsome natural opponent. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p14.15">The mastiff and bull-dog he fights have been tempered by man into ferocious fighting creatures, yet the natural integrity of the badger overpowers them. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p14.15">The turning point effects a change in both tone (now brutal) and milieu (the idyll of the forest substituted for the chaos of the town.) </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.15">
<s n="s1.5;p15.15">Clare uses sophisticated arrangement and a rhythmic metre closely associated with Shakespeare and his contemporaries. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p15.15">One could construe the motivation behind Clare's erudite choice of iambic pentameter and palindromic structure as an attempt to technically sophisticate his poetry. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p15.15">The complexity of construction in 'The Badger' parries notions of patronising simplicity in the audience: Clare evidently thought very carefully about the composition of his poem. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p15.15">'The Badger' is in no way the sole product of a "spontaneous overflow of feeling." </s>
<s n="s5.5;p15.15">It is the result of both an emotive and cerebral effort on behalf of the author. </s>
