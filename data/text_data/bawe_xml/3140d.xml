<head rend="underlined bold">Abstract</head>
<p n="p1.50">
<s n="s1.2;p1.50">The present study sought to assess the nutritional status of 11 subjects (2 male and 9 female) with ages ranging from 22-45 years. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p1.50">The assessment methods used were anthropometrical measurements of height, weight, skinfold thickness, bioelectrical impedance, circumference and breath measurements. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.50">
<s n="s1.1;p2.50">The study found 9 out of the 11 participants to be within the healthy range, while one female was undernourished and one male was over overnourished, according to some of the measurements. </s>
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="underlined bold">Introduction</head>
<p n="p3.50">
<s n="s1.13;p3.50">Measurements of nutritional status are important as they can determine a persons' health status and help predict health outcomes. </s>
<s n="s2.13;p3.50">These measurements may be useful in deciding if and when to intervene, in order to improve the nutrition of people in danger of developing diseases caused or made worse by poor nutrition. </s>
<s n="s3.13;p3.50">A variety of measurements, such as dietary, anthropometric, biochemical status, and functional and clinical status measurements (Bates <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>, 2005), can be used to assess nutritional status. </s>
<s n="s4.13;p3.50">They can be used alone, or in combination which will give a more complete evaluation. </s>
<s n="s5.13;p3.50">The method used in the present study is the anthropometric assessment in which measurements such as height, weight, body mass index (BMI), circumference measurements and skinfold measurements are determined. </s>
<s n="s6.13;p3.50">Anthropometric measurements reflect body composition and development and are used mainly to evaluate the progress of growth in pregnant women, infants, children and adolescents, as well as detecting malnutrition and overnutrition in all groups (Whitney <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s7.13;p3.50">, 1996). </s>
<s n="s8.13;p3.50">Measurements for an individual are compared with population standards specific for the individuals' gender and age to see how body composition compares to norms. </s>
<s n="s9.13;p3.50">Uniform anthropometric standards are necessary because any inferences concerning individual or population nutritional status are dependent on the standards used for comparison; to control for the same individual being classed differently according to which standards are used for the evaluation. </s>
<s n="s10.13;p3.50">The basic anthropometric measurements of height and weight are fundamental in this assessment and give the basic measure of skeletal size and soft tissue mass. </s>
<s n="s11.13;p3.50">Height measurements may be used as indicators of general body size and of bone length, and in combination with age as an indicator of the nutritional status of groups (Fidanza, 1991). </s>
<s n="s12.13;p3.50">Various bone components can also be measured for detailed study of body composition. </s>
<s n="s13.13;p3.50">Components can for instance be a guide in indicating syndromes characterised by disproportionate limb or segment length growth. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.50">
<s n="s1.4;p4.50">Weighing should preferably be done in the morning before breakfast, as this will be the time where the body weight is the most accurate and stable from day to day. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p4.50">People often vary what they eat, and excretion of food may also vary during the day. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p4.50">It is therefore important that the weight is measured before intake of food and/or liquid, and preferably with empty bowels. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p4.50">Height measurements should also be taken early in the day, as the body shrinks slightly during the day as a result of gravity, as well as tiredness making the body slouch slightly. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.50">
<s n="s1.7;p5.50">The mid upper arm circumference is utilized to measure reduction in muscle mass and/or subcutaneous tissue, and is especially useful in developing countries where subcutaneous fat is frequently low. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p5.50">From this measurement the mid upper arm muscle area can be calculated. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p5.50">This provides a more valid index of the muscle mass and protein nutritional status as it reflects more accurately the changes in muscle tissue. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p5.50">However, the calculation (see methods section) overestimates muscle area by about 20-25% (Gibson, 2002), and thus may underestimate the severity of muscle tissue loss. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p5.50">Waist-hip circumference ratio can be used to establish the distribution of subcutaneous and intra-abdominal adipose tissue, and is thought to be more precise than skinfold measurements (Gibson, 2002). </s>
<s n="s6.7;p5.50">This measurement is important because an intra-abdominal lipid storage is correlated with a higher risk than that of subcutaneous fat storage (Bates, 2005). </s>
<s n="s7.7;p5.50">The waist-hip circumference cut-off point indicating a heightened risk for cardiovascular disease and death is 1.0 for men and 0.8 for women (Gibson, 2002). </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.50">
<s n="s1.6;p6.50">Approximately half the fat in the body is located just beneath the skin (Whitney, 1996), and the thickness of this fat is assumed to reflect the total body fat. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p6.50">Determining the skinfold thickness is thereby a means of estimating a persons' total body fat. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p6.50">However, the assumptions being made by this method are that the thickness of the subcutaneous fat storage reflects the constant proportion of body fat, and that the sites where the measurements are taken represent the average thickness of the entire subcutaneous adipose tissue (Gibson, 2002). </s>
<s n="s4.6;p6.50">These assumptions cannot be guaranteed, as the distribution of subcutaneous fat varies within gender, race, age, disease, body weight and nutritional status. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p6.50">The sum of skinfolds may be used as a measure of total body fat, though the optimal combination is not established. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p6.50">The present study uses triceps, biceps, subscapular and suprailiac. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.50">
<s n="s1.7;p7.50">Men and women do not have the same distribution of body fat, nor the same percentage. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p7.50">Women have on average more body fat than men, and the distribution is often centred on the lower part (hips and buttocks) of the body, as well as the chest, whereas men tend to store body fat on the abdomen. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p7.50">As well as gender differences, there are also age differences, in that the body tends to store more fat as one gets older. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p7.50">For this reason there are age- and gender- specific standards of comparison. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p7.50">Furthermore, when weighing adults the subject should preferably have only underwear on. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p7.50">However, this might in some cases, such as the present study where a whole group is in the same room, prove difficult. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p7.50">In such a case, one should be weighed with clothes on, and subtract 1-1.5 kg from the recorded weight. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.50">
<s n="s1.1;p8.50">Body Mass Index (BMI) is calculated using the height and weight measurements, and is the most widely used tool to assess undernutrition and overnutrition in adults. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.50">
<s n="s1.5;p9.50">For children under the age of three there are not only different standards for comparison, but also different methods of measurement, since they cannot be expected to stand upright to be measured. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p9.50">The height would be measured lying in the recumbent position, using an infantometer with a moveable footboard and a fixed headboard. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p9.50">The height measurement would be the distance between the two boards. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p9.50">And for weighing, the infant is allowed to sit on a special scale while being weighed. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p9.50">There is also a similar scale for adults who for various reasons cannot stand up, and they can be measured sitting (Whitney, 1996). </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.50">
<s n="s1.7;p10.50">Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) is an easy, non-evasive method of calculating body composition, and can be used to calculate fat free mass (FFM) and total body water (TBW). </s>
<s n="s2.7;p10.50">However, to obtain accurate results the following guidelines must be followed precisely: the subject must not exercise 12 hours prior to the measurement. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p10.50">Five hours must have passed since the last meal. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p10.50">Water must not be consumed in excess before the measurement. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p10.50">The subject must not drink coffee four hours prior to testing. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p10.50">Alcohol must not be consumed 24 hours prior. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p10.50">And it is important to verify the subjects' weight immediately prior to testing. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.50">
<s n="s1.5;p11.50">Anthropometric measurement is a relatively precise, quick, easy and cheap assessment, and is for these reasons, along with the fact that the equipment is easily transported, the most commonly used form of nutritional assessment. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p11.50">However, the accuracy and usefulness of anthropometric assessment is limited by several factors such as the skills of the assessor, accuracy of the equipment, and the interpretation of the measurements. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p11.50">Fluid retention and dehydration will affect such measurements, and exercise will influence muscle size independently of nutrition. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p11.50">Some of these measurements (e.g. skinfold thickness and circumference) are difficult to carry out on certain people, such as obese people, or the elderly (who will most likely have some loose skin that will then be registered as fat even though it might not be). </s>
<s n="s5.5;p11.50">Furthermore, anthropometric studies cannot be used to determine small changes in body composition over short periods of time, as the measurements will change at a slower pace. </s>
