<s n="s2.5;p29.65">When your brain has reduced oxygen supply it can cause some ischaemic damage in the brain which manifests itself as the limb weakness and facial problems as you have experienced. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p29.65">Risk factors for having these strokes include high blood pressure, cardiac problems, having had strokes in the past, a high cholesterol level and a family history, we are looking into all of these causes whilst you are in hospital so that we can aim to modify them and reduce your risks of having further strokes. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p29.65">An increase in your blood pressure and cholesterol can cause narrowing of your arteries which leads to reducing the blood and oxygen supply to your brain. </s>
