<s n="s1.3;p2.18">Rationalism is a philosophical view that was originally developed by Rene Descartes, and is often known as Continental rationalism, as its creator was French. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p2.18">Rationalism states that all knowledge, including scientific, can be obtained using reasoning and deductive logic, after the initial establishment of a self-evident truth. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p2.18">Such a self-evident truth may be a mathematical axiom, for example; when two parallel straight lines are crossed by a third, then the opposite interior angles are equal.<ref target="BAWE_6091d-ftnote.001"/> From this and similar foundations everything we observe around us could be logically deduced. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p3.18">In contrast to this view, was Empiricism, or British Empiricism as it became know due to two of its large contributors Francis Bacon and John Locke, both of whom were British. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p3.18">Empiricism states that all knowledge can only come from experiment and sensory experience. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p3.18">It is considered the basis of modern science, but is not without flaw. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p3.18">Alongside the doctrine of Empiricism, is induction. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p3.18">Induction is a process of reasoning, from specifics, such as particular facts to generalised rules. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p3.18">Here is such an example taken from Cushing; 'from the fact that all men in past ages who have ever existed have died, we might induce the general proposition that all men including those still alive and even those yet to be born, are mortal.' <ref target="BAWE_6091d-ftnote.002"/> </s>

<s n="s1.5;p4.18">Descartes established rationalism in the 1600's. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p4.18">To extract knowledge using this philosophy Descartes would first begin by taking apart everything he could hold as untrue, such as things that he observed; he used the example of dreaming, he said that your mind sees things in dreaming that are often quite untrue, and this implied we cannot trust our senses. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p4.18">Descartes then attempts to establish a self-evident truth, and from this he uses a method of logic deduction to advance his knowledge. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p4.18">In his works '<hi rend="italic">Regulae</hi>' Descartes published rules for which he believed man could obtain certain knowledge. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p4.18">Below is an example of his work; </s>
</p>
<quote lang="English">" Rule II <hi rend="italic"> Only those objects should engage our attention, to the sure and indubitable knowledge of which our mental powers seem to be adequate.</hi> Science in its entirety is true and evident cognition... Thus in accordance with the above maxim we reject all such merely probable knowledge and make it a rule to trust only what is completely known and incapable of being doubted. ... Consequently if we reckon correctly, of the sciences already discovered, Arithmetic and geometry alone are left, to which the observance of this rule reduces us. ... Rule III <hi rend="italic"> In the subjects we propose to investigate, our inquiries should be directed, not to what others have thought, nor to what we ourselves conjecture, but to what we can clearly and perspicuously behold and with certainty deduce; for knowledge is not won in any other way.

<s n="s3.6;p6.18">The former example is ideal; of two parallel straight lines crossed by a third, to make the two interior angles equal. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p6.18">For everyday purposes this most certainly is true, but in the early 20 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> century when Einstein introduced his general theory of relativity, he found that non-Euclidean geometry held true. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p6.18">This implied that human knowledge could not be discovered from logic and deductive reasoning alone, and to some degree all human knowledge is imperfect. </s>

<s n="s2.2;p8.18">Bacon goes onto say; </s>
</p>
<quote lang="English" rend="italic">'Those who have handled sciences have been either men of the experiment of men of dogmas. The men of the experiment are like the ant, they only collect and use; the reasoners resemble spiders, who make cobwebs out of their own substance. But the bee takes a middle course it gathers its material from the flowers of the garden and of the field, but transforms and digests it by a power of its own. Not unlike this is the true business of the philosophy; for it neither relies solely or chiefly on the powers of the mind, nor does it take the matter which it gathers from natural history and mechanical experiments and lay it up in the memory whole, as it finds it, but lays it up in the understanding alternated and digested. Therefore from a closer and purer league between these two faculties, the experimental and the rational (such as has never yet been made), much may be hoped.' </quote>
<p n="p9.18">
<s n="s1.5;p9.18">In this aphorism Bacon attempts to explain his ideal scientific method, is analogous to the bee, which collects the natural material, manipulates it in its own manner, and then uses it for its own purposes. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p9.18">Bacon now identifies the induction process; we must collect our experiences and observations together and analyse these, then act on the most evident facts. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p9.18">Bacon continued by saying that we must make small steps from fact to axiom to law, using the inductive reasoning method. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p9.18">However there was still a problem presented by this method of science, and became known as the problem of induction. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p9.18">The problem of induction occurs in moving from specific instances to general cases, and how and when can this be done. </s>
