<s n="s1.6;p31.37">In the case of discretionary policy, i.e. without commitment, in period t-1 the government cannot make binding decisions over policy in period t until period t arrives. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p31.37">The period-t policy choice will not take into account how private sector decisions are made in period t-1, because when this policy choice is undertaken, private agents decisions have already been made in period t-1 and can no longer be influenced. </s>

<s n="s4.6;p31.37">As a result, economic outcomes will lead to lower welfare than under commitment. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p31.37">This follows from the fact that with rational expectations, policy in period t is perfectly anticipated, but owing to the time sequencing of decision-making, there is no way for the government to influence these expectations. </s>
