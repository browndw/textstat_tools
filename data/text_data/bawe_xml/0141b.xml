<s n="s2.7;p1.22">First, the responses of the enzyme to differing pH and temperature were examined. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p1.22">Optimum pH and temperature were determined to be 9.5 and 44°C respectively. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p1.22">Then, the Michaelis Menten constant was determined by plotting a Lineweaver Burk and Eadie Hofstee plot from the results obtained of enzyme action at differing substrate concentrations. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p1.22">K <hi rend="sub">M</hi> was calculated to be approximately 1mmoldm <hi rend="sup">-3</hi>. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p1.22">The product inhibition of alkaline phosphatase by inorganic phosphate was also examined, and it was established that the lowest phosphate concentration to produce marked change to enzyme activity was 20mmoldm <hi rend="sup">-3</hi>. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p1.22">This is much above the product produced in the other assays, ensuring that no product inhibition occurred during the rest of the experiment. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.22">
<s n="s1.1;p2.22">Finally the order of reaction was confirmed to be first order; the rate of the reaction catalysed by alkaline phosphatase is proportional to the concentration of p-nitrophenyl phosphate at concentrations where enzyme is not saturated with substrate. </s>

<head>Introduction:</head>
<p n="p3.22">
<s n="s1.1;p3.22">The enzyme used in this experiment was alkaline phosphatase, catalysing the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate to p-nitrophenol and inorganic phosphate. </s>

</p>
<p n="p5.22">
<s n="s1.2;p5.22">This reaction is particularly easy to assay due to the fact that the product of the reaction, p-nitrophenol is a coloured compound at low pH. This means that its concentration can be determined simply by measuring absorption at 410nm. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p5.22">The low pH is achieved by addition of a strong base, NaOH <hi rend="sub">(aq)</hi>, which also causes the denaturing of the enzyme, hence stopping the reaction at the required time. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.22">
<s n="s1.6;p6.22">For this first order enzyme catalysed reaction, at low substrate concentrations the rate of reaction is proportional to the concentration of the substrate. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p6.22">However, at higher concentrations the rate reaches a maximum, V <hi rend="sub">max</hi>. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p6.22">This is when the enzyme is saturated. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p6.22">The Michaelis-Menten constant (K <hi rend="sub">M</hi>), is the substrate concentration when the rate of reaction is ½ V <hi rend="sub">max</hi>. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p6.22">K <hi rend="sub">M</hi> is always the same for a particular enzyme with a particular substrate. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p6.22">Its value can be a useful to compare different enzymes catalysing the same reaction as it will indicate which enzyme can function efficiently at low substrate concentrations. (ie. the enzyme with lower K <hi rend="sub">M</hi> value) </s>

<head>Method:</head>
<p n="p7.22">
<s n="s1.6;p7.22">For the effects of pH and temperature on enzyme activity, the method in sections 11.4.2 of the laboratory manual was followed. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p7.22">For the determination of the Michaelis-Menten constant, the tubes were set up as shown in table 3. in the appendix (p.8). </s>
<s n="s3.6;p7.22">To each of these tubes, 1cm <hi rend="sup">3</hi> of buffer was added to make up 3cm <hi rend="sup">3</hi> volumes. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p7.22">The blank for the spectrophotometer was prepared by eliminating the substrate, but making sure to make up the 3cm <hi rend="sup">3</hi> volumes. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p7.22">The reaction was started by the addition of 1cm <hi rend="sup">3</hi> of the enzyme, alkaline phosphatase. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p7.22">Then the steps in 11.4.2 (ii), (iii) and (iv) were carried out. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.22">
<s n="s1.3;p8.22">The experiment analysing product inhibition of enzyme action required tubes with varying concentration of phosphate (Table 7., appendix p. 10) to be prepared. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p8.22">The blank for the spectrophotometer did not include any substrate. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p8.22">The reaction was started and terminated as explained in the laboratory manual. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.22">
<s n="s1.4;p9.22">Finally, the time course assay of the enzyme reaction was carry out by preparing 11 test tubes each containing 2cm <hi rend="sup">3</hi> p-nitrophenyl phosphate (5mM in 0,05M glycine buffer, pH9.5) and 1cm <hi rend="sup">3</hi> buffer. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p9.22">The reaction was started upon addition of 1cm <hi rend="sup">3</hi> of enzyme. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p9.22">Then, the reaction was stopped with addition of NaOH <hi rend="sub">(aq)</hi> at 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 min and then at 2 min intervals until 20 min. </s>
