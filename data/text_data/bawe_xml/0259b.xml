<quote lang="English">Much of Hegel's metaphysics develops independently of any epistemological basis. He avoids the first-person standpoint of Descartes not through any rival theory of knowledge, but by a process of abstraction which, because it abolishes the individual, leaves no room for the theory of knowledge at all. This makes Hegel's metaphysics so vulnerable to skeptical attack that it has now little to bequeath us but its poetry.<ref target="BAWE_0259b-ftnote.002"/>

</p>
<p n="p4.25">
<s n="s1.4;p4.25">With respect to his <hi rend="italic">Phenomenology of Spirit</hi>, I will argue precisely this point. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p4.25">Now, the size and complexity of such an issue as the role of skepticism in Hegel's thought, or a thorough epistemological defense of Hegel's system, is certainly beyond the scope of the present essay. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p4.25">Specifically, I will address what I take to be the gross misconception that Hegel's <hi rend="italic">Phenomenology</hi> proceeds in an epistemologically irresponsible manner, by demonstrating the key role that skepticism has in the establishment of the project as a whole, and its central place as the propelling force of necessity in its dialectical progression. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p4.25">What will emerge is a picture of the <hi rend="italic">Phenomenology</hi> as deeply attentive to skeptical concerns, one in which the skeptical moment is inextricable from the movement of the dialectic itself, having been critically appropriated by Hegel as <hi rend="italic">determinate</hi> negation. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.25">
<s n="s1.5;p5.25">As an entry point into our discussion, and in the interest of charity towards Hegel's critics, we would do well to first note to what extent an acquaintance with the <hi rend="italic">Phenomenology</hi> can offer <hi rend="italic">prima facie</hi> support for the claim that Hegel does <hi rend="italic">not</hi> appropriately value skepticism as such. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p5.25">When introducing the project he will undertake, he questions the value of an attitude that tirelessly doubts the very possibility of a cognition of being and asks: "Should we not be concerned as to whether this fear of error is not just the error itself?" </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0259b-ftnote.005"/>
<s n="s3.5;p5.25">He denounces that "conceit which understands how to belittle every truth, in order to turn back into itself and gloat over its own understanding"<ref target="BAWE_0259b-ftnote.006"/>, claiming this posture to be hiding "behind the pretension that its burning zeal for truth makes it difficult or even impossible to find any other truth but the unique truth of vanity".<ref target="BAWE_0259b-ftnote.007"/> Making obvious reference to Descartes, he criticizes that skeptical method that employs doubt in order to establish a putatively undogmatic first principle, characterizing it as a mere "shilly-shallying about this or that presumed truth, followed by a return to that truth again, after the doubt has been appropriately dispelled - so that at the end of the process the matter is taken to be what it was in the first place".<ref target="BAWE_0259b-ftnote.008"/> Beyond the introduction, we see skepticism being taken up explicitly once more in the section on the freedom of self-consciousness. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p5.25">At first glance, it may understandably raise suspicion that Hegel uses a mere four pages to demonstrate the ultimately self-corrupting contradictions of the skeptic's position. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p5.25">It is here that he refers to that position as "a purely casual, confused medley, the dizziness of a perpetually self-engendered disorder"<ref target="BAWE_0259b-ftnote.009"/> that maintains itself in "restless confusion".<ref target="BAWE_0259b-ftnote.010"/> The skeptical consciousness is identified as "the unconscious, thoughtless rambling which passes back and forth from the one extreme of self-identical self-consciousness to the other extreme of the contingent consciousness that is both bewildered and bewildering". <ref target="BAWE_0259b-ftnote.011"/> </s>

<s n="s3.9;p6.25">This is the distinction between the skepticism he sees as inadequate and his own conception of what he calls "thoroughgoing skepticism".<ref target="BAWE_0259b-ftnote.012"/> It is not that he sees no value in skepticism or skeptical arguments as such: what he finds unsatisfactory about skepticism, as it had been understood up until then, is its unwillingness to recognize its <hi rend="italic">self-completion</hi>. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p6.25">For Hegel, skepticism as it is normally encountered in philosophy is simply not radical enough. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p6.25">What his thoroughgoing skepticism cannot be is a mere suspension of some kinds of belief while others are held fast to dogmatically (e.g. where a base kind of sense immediacy is considered indubitable). </s>
<s n="s6.9;p6.25">Nor can it be a singularly negative stance where the result produced is no more than an insistence upon the impossibility of knowing. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p6.25">Instead, a Hegelian skepticism will be thorough: it will pursue all existing certainties, being satisfied with nothing less than claims with logical necessity. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p6.25">It will also be productive: skeptical inquiry, though in its outset is undeniably negative, yields a positive result insofar as it <hi rend="italic">determines</hi> the content upon which that negativity is exercised. </s>

<s n="s5.11;p8.25">The project is a phenomenology insofar as it looks at the way in which the world <hi rend="italic">appears</hi> to consciousness, and can thereby examine what consciousness thinks it knows by looking at what consciousness takes its objects to be. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p24.25">So, negation works to move the dialectic forward, and to move consciousness to a more adequate form, in a <hi rend="italic">specific</hi> way. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p24.25">Indeed, the immanence of the whole project depends on this idea that the next step is pointed to necessarily out of the very dissolution of the present one (i.e. that it is not introduced from without). </s>

<s n="s4.4;p24.25">Just as it is in the very way consciousness takes its object that causes it to become mired in contradiction, it is the very way in which each form fails that fixes the character of the next attempt, for "in the negation the transition has been made".<ref target="BAWE_0259b-ftnote.041"/> Determinate negation is not an unwarranted addition onto a contradictory concept, but is rather the realization that the dialectical progression from one concept to another is driven from <hi rend="italic">within</hi> the concepts themselves; "the new content is not deduced, but always has proven itself already to be that which endures the severity of contradiction".<ref target="BAWE_0259b-ftnote.042"/> As Harris writes, it is a "systematic progression towards absolute knowledge through the reflective criticism of the forms of belief which present themselves in a genetically necessary sequence - i.e. a sequence in which the breakdown of each form of consciousness leaves the germ of the next one as its natural residue".<ref target="BAWE_0259b-ftnote.043"/> For Hegel, this is skepticism taken to its limit, or seen in its self-completion. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p25.25">Taken up this way in the <hi rend="italic">Phenomenology</hi>, as both a regulating consciousness in the conception of its method, and as the principle of progression through its dialectical turns, it is not difficult to see how profoundly involved skepticism is in Hegel's entire project. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p25.25">Considering even the brief explanations offered here, the idea that Hegel was careless with regard to epistemology becomes increasingly implausible. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p25.25">To claim either that the rigour of justification and necessity was unimportant in his work, or that he took no interest in the issues of skepticism, is contradicted by close attention to the works themselves. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p25.25">Hegel takes skepticism seriously; but, he does not allow it to paralyze philosophy. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p25.25">Indeed, "Hegel contends that skepticism's target is dogmatism, not philosophy, for skepticism, rightly understood, is a permanent element in genuine speculative philosophy".<ref target="BAWE_0259b-ftnote.044"/> This conviction to <hi rend="italic">incorporate</hi> skepticism in philosophy, to recognize opposition and negation in their <hi rend="italic">determinateness</hi>, had persisted in Hegel's thought several years before the <hi rend="italic">Phenomenology</hi> was even begun. </s>
