<s n="s2.6;p7.18">The prior knowledge that Africans bought with them across the Atlantic would aid the economy and thus was an additional incitement for their enslavement. </s>

<s n="s4.6;p7.18">However, it must be taken into account, as has been noted by Philip D. Morgan<ref target="BAWE_0129d-ftnote.010"/>, that the Africans supplied to South Carolina were predominantly males from coastal regions where rice was not grown, and women primarily undertook the cultivation where it was. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p7.18">Therefore, the economic advantage of having Africans with existing skills of rice cultivation could <hi rend="italic">not</hi> have been a leading impetus for enslavement. </s>

<s n="s2.7;p8.18">The importation of eighty percent of all slaves was carried out between 1451 and 1810.<ref target="BAWE_0129d-ftnote.012"/> However, the early nineteenth century was a period in which the cotton industry was still in its very early years of production, consequently not requiring the vast numbers of slave workers previously brought into North America. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p8.18">This is particularly true of New England where there did not exist a staple crop that required such an economic need and 'compelling demand for Negroes'<ref target="BAWE_0129d-ftnote.013"/>, yet, as early as 1638, there existed a slave trade. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p8.18">Even though this has been viewed as merely 'weakly rooted'<ref target="BAWE_0129d-ftnote.014"/>, slavery was not <hi rend="italic">at all</hi> essential for the colony. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p8.18">In an explicit contrast, in Virginia and Maryland slavery became a 'vitally important institution'<ref target="BAWE_0129d-ftnote.015"/>, once legally established in 1660 following the initial arrival of Africans as indentured servants in 1619, signifying regional variation across the colonies of North America. </s>
