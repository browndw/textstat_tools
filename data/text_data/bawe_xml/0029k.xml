<s n="s1.12;p1.10">It is important to stress that the majority of people within Europe had 'little interest in or concern for the new worlds overseas revealed by the great discoveries of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. </s>
<s n="s2.12;p1.10">The manners and customs of exotic peoples excited few'.<ref target="BAWE_0029k-ftnote.002"/> However, there was a significant minority within European societies who did concern themselves with thinking about voyages, discoveries, the extra-European world and its peoples. </s>
<s n="s3.12;p1.10">It is this important sector upon which the essay will primarily be focused. </s>
<s n="s4.12;p1.10">In order to address this question, it is necessary first to examine the underlying beliefs and assumptions that the Europeans held of their extra-European neighbours, before going on to examine whether these were actually borne out upon initial contact. </s>
<s n="s5.12;p1.10">Urs Bitterli gives a useful definition of the term 'contact' - 'By cultural contact is meant an initial, short-lived or intermittent encounter between a group of Europeans and members of a non-European culture... </s>
<s n="s6.12;p1.10">Such contacts are characterized not only by their casualness and limited duration, but also by the rudimentary forms of communication between the representatives of the cultures concerned." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0029k-ftnote.003"/>
<s n="s7.12;p1.10">It is also essential to investigate whether these values and attitudes altered still further with increased long term propinquity with the extra-Europeans. </s>
<s n="s8.12;p1.10">This essay will argue that there was a conflict in the portrayal of extra - Europeans, as the Europeans were anxious to express the fact that they shared some basic similarities to reassure themselves that they were not dealing with totally unknown quantities. </s>
<s n="s9.12;p1.10">This can be seen in terming the majority of natives as pagans in order to create a common identity with which they were already familiar. </s>
<s n="s10.12;p1.10">They were also anxious to convey that there was a common humanity and that all humans were biologically linked as seen in their interest in the genealogy and background of the extra-Europeans. </s>
<s n="s11.12;p1.10">Meanwhile, conversely, the Europeans were also determined to set the natives apart from themselves and depict them as inferior in order to allow the conquest of their territory and the exploitation of the natives. </s>
<s n="s12.12;p1.10">It is this unusual paradox which the essay will address. </s>

<s n="s1.11;p2.10">There is much evidence to suggest that non-European peoples were assimilated rather quickly into the consciousness of the Europeans. </s>
<s n="s2.11;p2.10">It is important to examine why this was the case. </s>
<s n="s3.11;p2.10">It may have been due to fear owing to a lack of connection with Western traditions. </s>
<s n="s4.11;p2.10">A useful example is when the Europeans first came into contact with Native Americans - 'The discovery of new lands therefore brought encounters with peoples vastly different from what the Europeans had seen, read about, or even imagined." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0029k-ftnote.004"/>
<s n="s5.11;p2.10">Consequently, the first chroniclers had to produce a new term to describe them and the concept of the 'noble savage' was created. </s>
<s n="s6.11;p2.10">That is, the Native Americans were extremely friendly and pacifist but lacking laws, a society and a religion. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p2.10">This was indeed vastly different to anything the Europeans had expected to come into contact with, but the creation of the term 'noble savage' was important, because the common denominator was the belief that the natives were unquestionably part of a common identity. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p2.10">Perhaps, due to the great magnitude of inventions permeating through Europe around the time of overseas exploration (such as gunpowder, the compass, telescope and microscope), its people were 'fertile in ways for absorbing new ideas as well as new men'.<ref target="BAWE_0029k-ftnote.005"/> The easiest way to form a common identity with the extra-Europeans was to label them as something that made sense to the Europeans in their own world. </s>
<s n="s9.11;p2.10">Consequently, the non-Europeans were 'assimilated immediately and unselfconsciously as pagan people... [as] paganism was the most inclusive, unambiguous category of otherness'.<ref target="BAWE_0029k-ftnote.006"/> The prime reason for labelling extra-Europeans as followers of paganism was in order to give them a familiar identity. </s>
<s n="s10.11;p2.10">Literature on the topic was so extensive that different peoples from Asia, Africa and the Americas could easily be embraced - the idealized image of Native Americans was that they were 'primitive and friendly pagans'.<ref target="BAWE_0029k-ftnote.007"/> Perhaps most importantly, the fact that the extra-Europeans were considered to be pagans meant that they could be converted to Christianity - 'Newly discovered peoples were fitted into the Christocentric world view by being classified as pagans in need of conversion." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0029k-ftnote.008"/>
<s n="s11.11;p2.10">This belief was held in order to reassure the Europeans that they had nothing to fear upon meeting such a variety of extra-Europeans across the globe during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries - 'they had to reassert the identity and unity of mankind'. <ref target="BAWE_0029k-ftnote.009"/> </s>

<s n="s1.10;p3.10">In terms of classification, Europeans did not take much interest in categorizing extra-Europeans. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p3.10">For example, they did not differentiate between American Indians and ancient Egyptians. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p3.10">Instead of comparing the physical appearance of different extra-European peoples, the Europeans examined other characteristics. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p3.10">In this case, the American Indians and the ancient Egyptians had in common: a belief in gods, superstitions, rituals and artefacts - 'Establishing that commonality was the first step towards assimilation." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0029k-ftnote.010"/>
<s n="s5.10;p3.10">The easy comparability of heathen gods and customs was down to one common source - the devil. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p3.10">The Bible states that Satan authorised paganism. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p3.10">However, the devils' religion, like true religion, was always the same, and thus meeting the devil in extra-European lands was not a cause of great concern as proved by the idiom 'better the Devil you know...' </s>
<s n="s8.10;p3.10">Michael T. Ryan argues that, 'If you can't meet an old friend in a strange country, an old enemy is the next best thing." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0029k-ftnote.011"/>
<s n="s9.10;p3.10">Thus, from the outset, the Europeans were determined to portray the extra-Europeans as a common entity, from which they had nothing to fear. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p3.10">Consequently, most extra-Europeans were depicted as pagans in order to give the Europeans a sense of security, as they felt they could convert the native populations to Christianity, whilst also providing an excuse for subjugation and slavery in the future - a subject about which we will discuss more later. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p4.10">Another way in which the Europeans tried to understand and create an identity for the extra-Europeans was through their genealogy. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p4.10">It was felt that in order to understand their languages, beliefs and customs, it was necessary to uncover their ancestors and establish links back to the earliest days of mankind - 'To understand new peoples, it was necessary to invent their pasts." </s>

<s n="s5.7;p4.10">There was also a great interest in China in the seventeenth century not because of the people, 'who were scoundrels and rascals anyway',<ref target="BAWE_0029k-ftnote.013"/> but because the lineage of its peoples could be traced back so far in books that it rivalled that of the Bible. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p4.10">Thus, the Europeans did not just use paganism to classify the extra-Europeans, they were also interested in their genealogy in order to examine from where their ancestors had originated in order to create a sense of common identity of mankind. </s>

<s n="s1.9;p10.10">Therefore, in conclusion, it would be fair to argue that there were paradoxical depictions of extra-European peoples by the Europeans. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p10.10">On the one hand extra-Europeans were portrayed as part of a wider humanity in order to create a common identity between the European and extra-European cultures, as indicated by an interest in their genealogies. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p10.10">They were seen as pagans waiting for conversion. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p10.10">The best example of this is the formation of the term 'noble savage' in reference to Native Americans. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p10.10">On the other hand, however, the Europeans purposely set the extra-Europeans apart from themselves by depicting them as barbarians and heathens who were uncivilized. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p10.10">This notion was created to allow the subjugation and exploitation of extra-European peoples, which ultimately led to the creation of slavery. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p10.10">It is Ryan who best summarizes this point of view - 'The world, after all, was discovered by Europeans, not vice versa. </s>
