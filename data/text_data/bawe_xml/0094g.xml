<s n="s5.5;p22.26">On the other hand, Fletcher is sceptical about the reform's implications to the floating charge holders: "The prospects for the floating charge holder to receive any material recovery out of the realisations from floating charge assets are [now] subject to uncertainty[.]" </s>

<s n="s1.5;p23.26">The recent reforms have also resulted in other types of vulnerabilities. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p23.26">Firstly, a floating charge is invalid under the s.245(2) of the Insolvency Act (IA) 1986 if it was taken by an existing unsecured creditor 12 months before the company became insolvent.<ref target="BAWE_0094g-ftnote.027"/> Such floating charge will be valid only to the extent of consideration for the creation of the floating charge as set out in s.245(2). </s>
<s n="s3.5;p23.26">This provision is intended to protect the unsecured creditors - otherwise an existing unsecured creditor who takes up a floating charge would be in an (unfairly) advantageous position. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p23.26">Secondly, the administrators have obtained the power to override the interest of a floating charge holder.<ref target="BAWE_0094g-ftnote.028"/> They can sell property that is subject to a charge which as created was a floating charge without the need to obtain a court order. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p23.26">According to Davies, this limitation has been offset by giving the floating charge holder the same priority to a similar property.<ref target="BAWE_0094g-ftnote.029"/> </s>

<head>CONCLUSION</head>
<p n="p26.26">
<s n="s1.8;p26.26">In conclusion, the floating charge can be a very beneficial security. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p26.26">However, there are several factors that reduce the value of security that can be derived from a floating charge - it often falls short of being an ideal security for lenders. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p26.26">The recent legal reforms have made the floating charge less lucrative a security for lenders. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p26.26">Although, the past situation has been unfair to an extent, and therefore, the reforms can be justified. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p26.26">It can be argued that the worsened position of floating charge holders is a rather inevitable consequence of the emergence of the corporate rescue culture. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p26.26">The objective to maintain the company as a going concern and to ensure a better return to the unsecured creditors is likely to contradict the objective to maximise the recovered amount of debt for the floating charge holders. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p26.26">Nevertheless, in the cases of small companies, the floating charge is often the only option. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p26.26">Indeed, in such cases it is a beneficial - if not ideal - security from the perspective of both the company and the lender. </s>
