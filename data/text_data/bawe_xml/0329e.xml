<s n="s3.3;p6.32">Four measurements were taken from the pump: the suction pressure, the delivery pressure, force given by the pump, and the discharge. </s>

<p n="p7.32">

<s n="s2.4;p8.32">Before collecting this data the extension from the pump had to be centred in order to ensure that the system was in equilibrium without resting on other supports. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p8.32">If the shaft were to be resting on a shaft then the force measurement would be incorrect by a significant amount. </s>

<s n="s3.4;p10.32">For 2000 rpm the most extreme delivery pressures were 0.49 bar and 0.13 bar, so it was decided to take measurements every 0.05 bar from 0.45 bar to 0.15 bar. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p10.32">For 3000 rpm the most extreme delivery pressures were 1.30 bar and 0.40 bar, so it was decided to take measurements every 0.10 bar from 1.30 bar to 0.40 bar. </s>

<head>Evaluation of Results</head>
<p n="p20.32">
<s n="s1.4;p20.32">When the pump is running at 2000rpm the performance characteristics, as displayed by Graph 1, are as follows. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p20.32">Efficiency is a parabolic curve in which the maximum value of around 23.5% efficiency occurs at 0.9 litres sec-1 flow rate. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p20.32">Total head decreases at a constant rate as discharge increases, until discharge reaches 0.9 litres sec-1, at which point the total head starts decreasing at an increasing rate. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p20.32">Input power increases at a constant rate almost throughout. </s>
</p>
<p n="p21.32">
<s n="s1.5;p21.32">When the pump is running at 3000rpm the performance characteristics, as displayed by Graph 2, are as follows. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p21.32">Efficiency is a parabolic curve in which the maximum value of around 31.5% efficiency occurs at 1.2 litres sec-1 flow rate. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p21.32">Total head decreases at an increasing rate. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p21.32">However, it is fairly linear between 0 litres sec-1 and 0.9 litres sec-1 flow rate. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p21.32">Input power increases at a constant rate almost throughout. </s>
</p>
<p n="p22.32">
<s n="s1.8;p22.32">It is now possible to compare performance characteristics for when the pump is running at the two different speeds. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p22.32">At speeds of 3000rpm the pump has a maximum efficiency of 8% more than when it is running at 2000rpm. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p22.32">However, efficiencies are the same as each other for flow speeds of up to 0.4 litres sec-1. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p22.32">The total head decreases at the same rate at each speed when compared to the range of the flow rate. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p22.32">For example, if you stretched out the curve for 2000rpm, it would look like 3000rpm to quite a high extent. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p22.32">This suggests that if you tested another speed then its total head would also act in the same way as compared to its range of flow rate. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p22.32">Input power at 3000rpm increases at a faster rate than for 2000rpm. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p22.32">This means that for the same increase in flow rate, a greater power input increase is needed for higher speeds. </s>
</p>
<p n="p23.32">
<s n="s1.1;p23.32">In order to analyse Graph 3, which displays the 'Non-dimensional results', we can consider that the non-dimensional results represent coefficients of the variables within them, and therefore the non-dimensional results change in proportion to the variables, as discussed below. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p24.32">
<formula notation="" id="BAWE_0329e-form.001"/> decreases at an almost constant rate. </s>

<s n="s3.5;p24.32">The only other variable in the equation, which forms ?P, is the suction pressure. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p24.32">The suction pressure also changes at a constant rate. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p24.32">This non-dimensional will therefore change at a constant rate because ?P changes at a constant rate. </s>

<formula notation="" id="BAWE_0329e-form.002"/> increases at a decreasing rate. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p25.32">This is because discharge, Q, increases at a decreasing rate. </s>

<p n="p26.32">
<s n="s1.2;p26.32">
<formula notation="" id="BAWE_0329e-form.003"/> increases at a decreasing rate. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p26.32">This is because force increases at a decreasing rate, which means that torque, T, increases at a decreasing rate. </s>
</p>
<p n="p27.32">
<s n="s1.4;p27.32">It can be seen from Graph 3 that for 3000rpm is larger than for 2000rpm. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p27.32">However, for 3000rpm is smaller than for 2000rpm. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p27.32">This indicates, due to the layout of the graph axes that as the speed increases the values of the non-dimensional numbers and will move closer together. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p27.32">However, the speed would have to increase by a very significant amount for them to have the same value. </s>
</p>
<p n="p28.32">
<s n="s1.5;p28.32">There are some possible sources of random error in this experiment, which may account for any anomalies within the data. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p28.32">Firstly, due to the fact that the delivery pressure and suction pressure were displayed on analogue dials, they may have not been recorded accurately, due to the spacing between numbers of the dial being wide. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p28.32">This therefore means that the values of the pressures can only really be measured effectively to 0.05, when sometimes the pointer may have been in-between these points. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p28.32">A way to rectify this would be to increase the number of markings on the dials. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p28.32">Secondly, when moving the extension to the pump in the measuring of the force, then it may not have been centred correctly, thereby inducing small errors. </s>
</p>
<p n="p29.32">
<s n="s1.5;p29.32">There are also some possible sources of systematic error in this experiment. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p29.32">However, because they are systematic we may not actually know about them. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p29.32">For example, there was one calibration error noticed on the Venturi Manometer when measuring for speeds of 3000rpm. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p29.32">For the first couple of readings the manometer read - 4, when it should have been 0. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p29.32">The results were calibrated by increasing each value by 4, therefore virtually calibrating the manometer readings. </s>

<head>Conclusions</head>
