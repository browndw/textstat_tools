<s n="s1.4;p1.20">Both <hi rend="italic">The Waste Land</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Movern Callar</hi> succeed in representing a contemporary moment; each efficaciously captures the zeitgeist of their age but in highly divergent ways. </s>

<ref target="BAWE_3008d-ftnote.003"/>

<s n="s7.9;p2.20">Nature imparts the freedom and exhilaration she seeks, literarily making her feel high; 'The land was flattening out I was getting so high up and a hot haze had appeared in the clear bright light,'<ref target="BAWE_3008d-ftnote.006"/> where as alcohol and substance abuse often leaves her feeling; 'queerish." </s>

<ref target="BAWE_3008d-ftnote.012"/> Movern's explicit dependence on routine and fascination with the Spanish religious precession suggests she craves the security and structure offered by faith, but by walking; 'towards strobe of the nightclub,'<ref target="BAWE_3008d-ftnote.013"/> she unequivocally turns toward a different leading light for direction. <ref target="BAWE_3008d-ftnote.014"/> </s>

<s n="s2.10;p3.20">One strategy used by Warner to reflect this is making all images and acts explicitly subject to manifold interpretation, a motif encapsulated by the dismembered corpse. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p3.20">On one level, 'His' interment implies there is no God, but severing the unified body may also be demonstrative of contemporary religious multiplicity, as many reject the notion of one God and draw spiritual guidance from various religions. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p3.20">Religion, like the symbolic purpose of the body, is multiple. </s>

<s n="s9.10;p3.20">Movern's buoyant optimism when burying 'His' dissected remains, could be read as a celebratory rejection of imposed hierarchical masculine inflexibility<ref target="BAWE_3008d-ftnote.015"/> and as an indication to embrace multiplicity, a quality often connoted to the female.<ref target="BAWE_3008d-ftnote.016"/> Warner may be implying that future frameworks should be based on more feminine characteristics such as being open and adaptable, values necessary for social advancement. </s>
