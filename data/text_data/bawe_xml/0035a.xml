<s n="s1.2;p2.75">Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the yeast used by bakers and brewers. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p2.75">Its ~13Mb genome has been sequenced, and this along with its similarity to higher organisms in terms of basic biological processes (including biosynthetic pathways, DNA replication and repair, signal transduction, and cell cycle repair), and its ease of genetic manipulation makes it a good experimental organism. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.75">
<s n="s1.3;p3.75">This investigation uses three proteins: p53, SV40 and lamin put into 2 categories, bait and prey. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p3.75">The bait is put with both of the prey, to see which it will interact with. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p3.75">Figure 1 shows how these three proteins are used in this experiment in a yeast-2-hybrid screen, where the 2 haploid cells mate to form a diploid. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.75">
<s n="s1.1;p4.75">The yeast strains used are Y187 (mating type α) and AH109 (mating type <hi rend="bold">a</hi>). </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.75">
<s n="s1.1;p5.75">The yeast's preferred state is as a diploid, therefore it will always attempt to mate to become a diploid if it's in its haploid state, insuring mating without any artificial intervention required. </s>

<head rend="italic">Figure 1. Life cycle of S. cerevisiae</head>
</figure>
<p n="p6.75">
<s n="s1.5;p6.75">SV40 (simian virus 40), has a large T antigen, which is the protein used in this experiment as part of the "bait" construct. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p6.75">It is a DNA binding protein with high affinity for segments of the viral genome, where it works to prevent apoptosis of the host, ensuring its survival. It is tested here to see whether it binds to the proteins lamin or p53. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p6.75">The bait construct also contains the LEU2 gene, a nutritional marker that allows transformed yeast to grow without leucine. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p6.75">(This is important as the yeast strains used: AH109 and Y187 cannot grow naturally in the absence of leucine, tryptophan, uracil or histidine). </s>
<s n="s5.5;p6.75">LEU2 and the T antigen of SV40 are on a plasmid in AH109 (diagram on page 26 of manual). </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.75">
<s n="s1.3;p7.75">P53 and lamin are the "prey" of the experiment. p53 is the product of a tumour suppressor gene, and is involved in regulating the activity of some other genes and prevents cells entering cell division. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p7.75">Lamin are structural components found in most multicellular organisms. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p7.75">Either lamin or p53, along with the TRP1 nutritional marker (allows growth in the absence of tryptophan) are inserted into a plasmid in Y187 (diagram page 25 of manual) and used as pray. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.75">
<s n="s1.1;p8.75">The interaction between one of the prey and the bait, will be shown by the production of the reporter genes by the activation of the upstream activation sequence (which can only occur in the diploid cell, not haploid) </s>

<p n="p9.75">

</p>
<p n="p10.75">
<s n="s1.3;p10.75">Transformation of the bait and prey DNA constructs was carried out as described in the manual on pages 14 and 15. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p10.75">The first alteration made, was the second 30 <hi rend="sup">o</hi>C incubation detailed in steps 12 and 15 was shortened to 30 minutes from 50 minutes, as this was sufficient. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p10.75">The second alteration was that the centrifugation of step 16 was increased from 1000rpm to 2000 rpm, as the lower speed did not give the extent of pelleting required. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.75">
<s n="s1.1;p11.75">The mating of the transformed haploid yeast strains and the calculation of the transformation efficiency was followed exactly as described in the lab manual on page 18. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.75">
<s n="s1.1;p12.75">Testing diploid cultures for the reporter gene was carried out as described on page 20 of the manual, using 16 rather than 36 squares. </s>

<head rend="underlined bold">Results</head>
<p n="p14.75">
<s n="s1.1;p14.75">The transformation efficiency of the haploid yeast strains were calculated (as described in the manual on page 18) to be as follows: AH019-p53 =2008 cfu/µg DNA, AH109-lamin = 1716 cfu/µg DNA, Y187-SV40 = 10 cfu/µg DNA. It can be seen that the most efficient was p53 and the least efficient SV40. </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.75">
<s n="s1.1;p15.75">The number of diploid colonies per transformation mating plate was 220 for Y187-SV40 mated with AH109-p53, and 26 for Y187-SV40 mated with AH109-lamin. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p16.75">Figure 2 shows a photograph of an X-a plate. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p16.75">It can be seen that there was very little p53 growth at all, but on what there is blue can be seen. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p16.75">There is much more lamin growth, showing more diploids were produced and blue can be seen here also. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p16.75">This implies that the reporter gene MEL-1 (produces -galactosidase) was expressed in both p53 and lamin, and therefore interaction occurred between the proteins in both pairs. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p17.75">The values in figure 3 show that a greater amount of ONPG is hydrolysed to o-nitrophenyl and D-Galactose per minute per cell in the case of p53 than lamin. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p17.75">This implies that the interaction between Y187-SV40 and AH109-p53, is much greater than that between Y187-SV40 and AH109-lamin. </s>

<head rend="bold">Discussion</head>
<p n="p18.75">
<s n="s1.3;p18.75">The transformation efficiency of the three proteins into the haploid yeast strains varies enormously. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p18.75">This could be is because of the effectiveness of the different plasmids at incorporating into the yeast. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p18.75">Here both of the prey plasmids transformed with far higher efficiency than the bait plasmids. </s>
</p>
<p n="p19.75">
<s n="s1.2;p19.75">Following transformation, the plasmids were maintained in the yeast strains by being plated onto plates that ensured that they had to synthesize the amino acid missing on the plate, which the yeast were only able to do in the presence of the plasmid. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p19.75">The AH109-lamin and AH109-p53 were grown in the absence of tryptophan, and Y187-SV40 in the absence of leucine. </s>
</p>
<p n="p20.75">
<s n="s1.2;p20.75">The method of transformation used here was lithium acetate, which acts by punching holes in the membrane of the yeast. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p20.75">Other methods that could have been used include electroporation, where the shock of electricity makes the membranes more permeable. </s>
</p>
<p n="p21.75">
<s n="s1.4;p21.75">It would have been expected that the p53 would turn blue, and not the lamin, as other groups in the laboratory were able to show. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p21.75">This is because p53 it would express Mel-1, and therefore produce α-galactosidase, which would hydrolyse X-α Gal causing the yeast to turn blue. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p21.75">This did happen to small extent, but the blue of the lamin also needs to be accounted for. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p21.75">Lamin does contain some (much less that p53) Mel-1, which must have been released as they died, causing the blue yeast. </s>
</p>
<p n="p22.75">
<s n="s1.3;p22.75">The quantification results, as shown in figure 3 support the above theory that the blue colouring shown for lamin interactions was due to released Mel-1 already in the lamin, rather than being caused by protein interactions. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p22.75">It supports this as it shows there to be a greater amount of β-galactosidase units for p53 interactions, by over 10 times greater. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p22.75">For the reporter gene, LacZ (which encodes β-galactosidase) to be expressed, protein interaction must have occurred and therefore for there to be so many more β-galactosidase units for p53 than lamin, it must be p53 that interacts with SV40. </s>
</p>
<p n="p23.75">
<s n="s1.4;p23.75">Rather than using the reporter genes lacZ or MEL-1 ADE2 could have been used. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p23.75">ADE-2 contains a nutritional marker, meaning it could have been selected for on plates lacking adenine, in a similar we to trp- and leu- plates were used here. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p23.75">The marker on the plates if ADE-2 was used would have been red signalling protein interaction. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p23.75">The result expected in this instance would have been activation by interaction of the p53 protein. </s>
