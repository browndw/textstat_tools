<head>Why does the bromination of acetanilide stop at the mono-bromo stage?</head>
<p n="p23.24">
<s n="s1.2;p23.24">The bromination of acetanilide stops at the mono-bromo stage as the nitrogen atom in an amide is much less basic than in an amine as it is conjugated with the carbonyl group. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p23.24">Amine is more reactive due to the increased electron density in the ring however in the amide, nitrogen cannot donate electrons as effectively to the ring system due to the conjugation and hence substitution is far more controlled and ends at the mono-bromo stage. </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head>Why does this bromination occur only at the <hi rend="italic">para</hi> - (4-) position?</head>
<p n="p24.24">
<s n="s1.2;p24.24">Bromination occurs only at the <hi rend="italic">para</hi> position, as the substitution of bromine deactivates the benzene ring - withdraws electrons from the ring and therefore stops the resonance at the <hi rend="italic">para</hi> position. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p24.24">In addition to take the <hi rend="italic">ortho</hi> position the electrophile would encounter significant steric hindrance due to the large substituent e.g. amide, and hence the <hi rend="italic">para</hi> position is more energetically favourable. </s>
