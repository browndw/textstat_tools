<p n="p12.14">
<s n="s1.2;p12.14">The entropy of vapourisation of carbon dioxide was found to be, on average, 77.87 ± 7.11 JK <hi rend="sup">-1</hi>mol <hi rend="sup">-1</hi>, and that of nitrogen to be 77.66 ± 6.04 JK <hi rend="sup">-1</hi>mol <hi rend="sup">-1</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p12.14">These values are in agreement with Trouton's rule that states the entropy of vapourisation of most substances is approximately equal to 85 JK <hi rend="sup">-1</hi>mol <hi rend="sup">-1</hi> . </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.14">
<s n="s1.4;p13.14">The apparatus used in the experiment is simpler than that which would be desirable to obtain fully accurate data. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p13.14">However, the uncertainties calculated show that the results were sufficiently accurate to agree with Trouton's rule. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p13.14">The major sources of uncertainty were the measurement of the volume of water used and the estimation of the temperature change, which at best could only be made to the nearest half-degree. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p13.14">An accurate thermocouple measurement of the liquid would have been more desirable. </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.14">
<s n="s1.1;p14.14">The temperature of the gaseous cryogen should have been measured for each experiment, as the amount of cryogen used in each was significantly different (especially for CO <hi rend="sub">2</hi>) to give a large difference in the amount of energy taken out of the water, and hence seriously affect the overall result. </s>
