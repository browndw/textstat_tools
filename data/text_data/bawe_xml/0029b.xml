<s n="s1.5;p1.13">This essay will assess the three most common interpretations of the Bolshevik Revolution of October 1917 in trying to discover whether the Bolsheviks were successful because they had a mass following. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p1.13">It will examine whether the insurrection was a coup d'Ã©tat conducted by a small and purely self-interested faction, acting entirely for their own benefit - the view subscribed to by many western liberal historians, or whether the successful insurrection was due to the mass support of the Russian people for the Bolshevik party, which was merely realizing their demands - a rigidly enforced Socialist interpretation which all Soviet authors were forced to portray. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p1.13">The final interpretation and the one that this essay will subscribe to is that the Bolsheviks came to power in October 1917 because they had the support of an important minority in Russian society, namely the workers and soldiers, and that the peasants also saw them as the best potential provider of their wishes at the time, especially regarding the re-distribution of the land. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p1.13">Therefore, there was no real opposition to the Bolshevik coup but it would be wrong to describe them as having popular support. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p1.13">The essay will also examine other decisive factors which meant the Bolsheviks were successful in their quest for power, including the significance of Lenin's role in the Revolution as well as the mistakes and unpopularity of the Provisional Government. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.13">
<s n="s1.12;p2.13">Some historians, the vast majority of whom were living in Russia under Communist rule, believe that the Bolsheviks had the support of the masses in Russia and this was the primary reason for their success - 'In the Soviet view, the Bolshevik triumph was based upon its success in winning the support of nothing less than a majority of the population." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0029b-ftnote.001"/>
<s n="s2.12;p2.13">They argue that the Bolsheviks managed to educate the people and form a new mass consciousness. </s>
<s n="s3.12;p2.13">Indeed, between February and October 1917, the membership of the Bolshevik party rose from 24,000 to 350,000. </s>
<s n="s4.12;p2.13">The party even managed to attract the support of the peasants - 'Nevertheless the party succeeded in winning [the peasants] over to its programme... </s>
<s n="s5.12;p2.13">In the words of Lenin, "Here was objective proof, proof not in words, but in deeds, of the people coming over to the side of the Bolsheviks."'<ref target="BAWE_0029b-ftnote.002"/> The increase in support for the Bolshevik party was largely from June onwards and their proposals began to be passed in the soviets in various cities. </s>
<s n="s6.12;p2.13">The July Days had proved that the Bolsheviks had the support of the vast majority of the workers, soldiers and sailors. </s>
<s n="s7.12;p2.13">After the Kornilov Affair, Bolshevik support began to grow even more rapidly as they put forward the motion of a left wing dominated government, which the Soviet passed - 'the social polarization of the summer gave the Bolsheviks their first real mass following as a party which based its main appeal on the plebian rejection of all superordinate authority." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0029b-ftnote.003"/>
<s n="s8.12;p2.13">The Presidium (the organizing committee) of the Petrograd Soviet now had seven members, four of whom were Bolsheviks - 'Bolsheviks thus stood at the head of the institution that was most representative of the popular movement." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0029b-ftnote.004"/>
<s n="s9.12;p2.13">This helped to increase their popularity still further - 'During August Bolshevism was growing almost throughout the entire breadth of the land." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0029b-ftnote.005"/>
<s n="s10.12;p2.13">They were the second largest party in the country after polling 33 per cent in the Petrograd City Duma elections - a massive rise of almost 15 per cent in just three months. </s>
<s n="s11.12;p2.13">This trend continued as the Bolsheviks scored a victory in the local Duma elections receiving 52 per cent of the total vote cast 'winning an outright majority in eleven of the seventeen districts." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0029b-ftnote.006"/>
<s n="s12.12;p2.13">The total number of Bolshevik voters had doubled between June and September. </s>

<s n="s3.9;p4.13">Trotsky argues that it was impossible for the masses to take power anyway - 'just as a blacksmith cannot seize the red hot iron in his naked hand, so the proletarian cannot seize the power, it has to have an organisation accommodated to this task." </s>
