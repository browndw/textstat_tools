<item>Reduce scrap to a minimum</item>
</list>
<p n="p5.80">
<s n="s1.2;p5.80">We tried to keep our production costs low by utilizing capacity and using different shifts when necessary by precise forecasting and efficient inventory management to ensure on-time delivery. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p5.80">The way we used logistics and operations management tools to help us achieve our objectives are described below. </s>

<head>1.2.1) Forecasting</head>
<p n="p6.80">
<s n="s1.3;p6.80">Forecasting is predicting or estimating before hand. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p6.80">It plays a very important role in capacity planning and inventory management and also provides valuable input to other functions of the organisation. </s>

<p n="p7.80">
<s n="s1.5;p7.80">Selecting the forecasting technique was a difficult task for our company (Falcon). </s>
<s n="s2.5;p7.80">With brief discussion and thorough understanding of the market and data available for forecasting it was decided that "Moving Averages" forecasting technique is useful and perform better for our company. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p7.80">We used this technique because it is the simplest way of smoothing past data that is used for forecasting. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p7.80">Most recent data is most relevant in forecasting short-term demand because it reveals latest trends better than data several years old. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p7.80">It is necessary to analyse the data after removing trends and seasonality from the set of data and incorporating them afterwards. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.80">
<s n="s1.3;p8.80">Average sales for the first 12 weeks this year was 5416 units compared with last year's 4670 which is approximately 15% more. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p8.80">This helped us establish this year's weekly aggregate demand at 6250 units or 25000 in a month. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p8.80">Based on this approach our strategy was to forecast for four weeks and accordingly place orders for the raw materials so that we never run out of our raw material stock. </s>

<head>1.3) CHANGING STRATEGIES</head>
<div3>
<head>1.3.1) Level 1: week 13 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> to 16 <hi rend="sup">th</hi>
</head>
<p n="p9.80">
<s n="s1.6;p9.80">We were reactive and chasing demand as it occurs, in 14 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 15 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> week we didn't order any raw material because demand was too low, lower than past year's average. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p9.80">We were concerned with the cash flow so that in an attempt to order lots of raw material we may not run out of cash and go bankrupt. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p9.80">In the first level after gaining some profits we transferred money from current account to deposit account and earned some positive interest. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p9.80">In 16 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> week we didn't produce any aerial so our unit cost for this period increased to £37,000 which was much higher than the lowest unit cost £37 in the day shift. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p9.80">The reason for this we thought we have enough finished goods inventory to supply next week. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p9.80">By this chase strategy we paid huge fixed cost which could have been avoided by utilizing a shift. </s>
</p>
</div3>
<div3>
<head>1.3.2) Level 2: week 17 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> to 20 <hi rend="sup">th</hi>
</head>
<p n="p10.80">
<s n="s1.4;p10.80">Before starting this level we calculated break even analysis which came 3000 units every week so that we may not again miss the opportunity of utilizing capacity and pay the fixed costs. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p10.80">We became proactive rather than reactive since our demand was fluctuating. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p10.80">In the trend there was a rise in the demand and the peak period comes gradually with modest peak in third week followed by highest peak in fourth week. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p10.80">In order to meet this demand we decided to build up stock to buffer against supply problems and finished goods stock to buffer against fluctuations in demand keeping in view the next peak period. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.80">
<s n="s1.4;p11.80">We insisted on make to stock because cost of holding inventory in the game is only 0.5% compared to 12 % penalty of the sales value of under delivered goods. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p11.80">We accumulated finished goods stock than depleted in the peak period and made profits. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p11.80">In this level we added 10% more to our forecasted demand because of scrap, rework and machine down time. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p11.80">By the end of this level i.e. in weeks 19 and 20 we ordered more raw materials due to introduction of a new model XL which requires two units of accessories in addition to the other components, keeping in view one raw material has greater lead time. </s>
</p>
</div3>
<div3>
<head>1.3.3) Level 3: week 21 <hi rend="sup">st</hi> to 24 <hi rend="sup">th</hi>
</head>
<p n="p12.80">
<s n="s1.5;p12.80">During the third level with the introduction of the XL model, the break-even point stood at 2560 units for XL models but was pushed a little higher to 3200 units for standard model per week. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p12.80">A 3200 units figure, being a conservative out of the two, was picked up as a break-even point by our group. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p12.80">It was primarily due to an increase in semi-fixed costs. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p12.80">However, the reason for drop in the break-even units for XL model was increase in the contribution as a result of increase in the selling price. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p12.80">There was a very marginal increase in the cost of the product but the rise in the labour </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.80">
<s n="s1.2;p13.80">cost was covered by the increase in contribution per unit. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p13.80">On the whole break-even point was a useful tool to monitor our progress during the game. </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.80">
<s n="s1.7;p14.80">In a group we decided to keep a healthy stock of 'accessories' because they would only cost £1 and had a two weeks' delivery time. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p14.80">Although being cheap this component was equally important for the production. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p14.80">Increased usage of this component in production of aerials for XL model in level 3 was another reason to keep high inventory of this component in the later weeks. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p14.80">Keeping a stock of 'accessories' did not put much burden on our finances and ensured the availability at all times. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p14.80">We decided to reduce the stock of 'main body' and 'aerial' as these were expensive items to keep in stock and would also increase our cost of holding inventory. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p14.80">Shorter delivery time was another reason to reduce the stock for these items. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p14.80">The only time that we would increase the stock for these items was a weak before expected rise in demand to enable us to increase our finished goods stock. </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.80">
<s n="s1.2;p15.80">By looking at the trend last year it was detectable that every fourth week there is a rise in the demand and peak period comes gradually with modest peak in third week followed by highest peak in fourth week. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p15.80">In order to meet this demand we decided to build up stock to meet customers demand in these peak periods. </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.80">
<s n="s1.4;p16.80">It can be seen from the figures 1.1 and 1.2 below we had inventory cost almost throughout the three levels and the total at the end of 24 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> week was £13,671 compared to £51,620 penalty cost which we had only five times. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p16.80">Initially we were only focused on meeting customers demand and ordering a lot of raw materials so had inventory costs but after looking at bank conditions we started forecasting more accurately to avoid cost of holding inventory also. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p16.80">Than we tried our best to do accurate forecasting but forecasting is never accurate and we had penalties, especially at the end of game in 23 <hi rend="sup">rd</hi> and 24 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> weeks. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p16.80">I think our group under forecasted a little as overall we satisfied 88% of our customers demand and had penalties for the 12% orders we missed to deliver. </s>

<head>1.4) MANAGEMENT OF DELIVERY (SCHEDULING)</head>
<p n="p17.80">
<s n="s1.4;p17.80">To get the right product to right place at right time and for right cost it is necessary to schedule activities in an effectual manner. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p17.80">Because no matter how good scheduling methods are it is unlikely that supply and demand will be in accord. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p17.80">Supply chain then require batching of materials for efficiency. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p17.80">To get the full advantage a balance must be achieved with quantities that promote efficiency and to avoid disadvantages of tied up inventory and money </s>
</p>
<p n="p18.80">
<s n="s1.3;p18.80">From customer's view point the order winner for our product is on time delivery since any shortages in supply are not carried forward. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p18.80">Since the demand is rising which is 15% more than last year we made every effort not to miss the peak in demand where greatest profit were available and not responding late when capacity exceeds demand, increasing inventory and further loss in profitability. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p18.80">In an attempt to satisfy most of our customer's demand we emphasised to keep more finished goods than raw materials as the cost of holding inventory is same 0.5% of the value for both raw materials and finished goods. </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head>1.5) CAPACITY MANAGEMENT:</head>
<p n="p19.80">
<s n="s1.6;p19.80">Capacity is the ability to produce. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p19.80">The overall aim of capacity management is to match the level of demand with the level of production. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p19.80">Less production than the demand means missed opportunity in terms of sales, turnover and profit. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p19.80">It also results in dissatisfaction among customers as a result an organisation looses market share. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p19.80">Over capacity means under utilisation of assets. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p19.80">Therefore, capacity management is another important area in operations management that needs to be carefully worked out. </s>
</p>
<p n="p20.80">
<s n="s1.7;p20.80">We operated our production system on 'made to stock'. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p20.80">Our total production capacity was 10,350 units per week against an average weekly forecast of 6250 units. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p20.80">Running a Saturday shift was not a feasible option in which a unit cost was £47.6, more than the selling price of £45, and which could only produce 600 units. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p20.80">Our strategy was to keep our unit cost at the lowest so that we could earn a reasonable profit from our sales. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p20.80">Based on this strategy we decided to produce at least 5000 units per week running a day shift to take advantage of low labour cost and decided to keep the unsold goods in stock for a peak demand period. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p20.80">It kept our unit cost at £37.0 per unit and helped us earn a reasonably good profit. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p20.80">As a contingency measure we also decided to run a night shift (E37.3) once in four weeks to reach 25,000 units in a month approximately so that we do not miss the peak week. </s>

<head>2.1) INTRODUCTION</head>
<p n="p21.80">
<s n="s1.2;p21.80">If a firm could order merchandise or raw materials and carry inventory with no expenses other than the cost of these items, there would be no need to be concerned about what quantity to order at a given time. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p21.80">However inventory costs are affected by both the cost of purchasing and the cost of carrying inventory i.e. </s>
</p>
<p n="p22.80">
<s n="s1.1;p22.80">Total inventory cost = total carrying costs + total ordering costs </s>
</p>
<p n="p23.80">
<s n="s1.3;p23.80">Carrying cost increase as inventories increase in size as it is sum of storage costs, insurance premiums, costs of money tied up in inventory, loses due to obsolescence or spoilage, opportunity cost, deterioration cost and other expenses. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p23.80">Ordering costs also known as purchase cost or set up cost, this is the sum of the fixed costs that are incurred each time an item is ordered. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p23.80">These costs are not associated with the quantity ordered but primarily with physical activities required to process the order include expenses associated with preparation and processing of purchase orders and expenses related to receiving and expecting purchase items. [1] </s>
</p>
<p n="p24.80">
<s n="s1.6;p24.80">Inventory is held to avoid the nuisance, the time and the cost etc. of constant replenishment. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p24.80">However, to replenish inventory only infrequently would necessitate the holding of very large inventories. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p24.80">It is therefore apparent that some balance or trade-off or compromise is needed in deciding how much inventory to hold, and therefore how much inventory to order. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p24.80">There are costs of holding inventory and there are costs of re-ordering inventory and these two costs need to be balanced. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p24.80">The point at which unit cost of preparing the purchase order for a quantity equals to the unit cost of carrying the materials in store is known as Economic Order Quantity (EOQ). </s>
<s n="s6.6;p24.80">The purpose of the EOQ is to minimise the total costs of inventory. </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head>2.2) INVENTORY CONTROL</head>
<p n="p25.80">
<s n="s1.2;p25.80">When determining how much to order at a time, an organisation will recognise that as order quantity rises, average stock rises and the total annual cost of holding stock rises and the number of orders decreases and the total annual re-order costs decrease. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p25.80">The point at which cost is minimised is the EOQ. This cost behaviour is illustrated by the graph in Figure 2.1. </s>

<p n="p26.80">
<s n="s1.9;p26.80">The first curve is drawn to show the acquisition or procurement costs. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p26.80">This curve can be expected to fall from left to right as the quantity to be bought on each purchase order is increased. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p26.80">This effect arises from the supplier's quantity discounts and, to smaller extent, from administrative savings made as a result of having to prepare purchase orders at less frequent intervals. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p26.80">The second curve is for stock holding costs. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p26.80">It will rise from left to right, as increased amounts are purchased and the cost of inventory investment and storage grow. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p26.80">The third curve is the result of adding first two curves together. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p26.80">This gives a curve of total procurement and stockholding costs. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p26.80">The minimum point of this curve corresponds to the intersection of purchasing and inventory curves. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p26.80">This minimum point indicates the economic order quantity. [2] </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head>2.3) REDUCED COSTS</head>
<p n="p27.80">
<s n="s1.5;p27.80">The way to address demand distortion caused by order batching is to find ways to reduce the cost of order processing and transportation. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p27.80">This will cause EOQ lot sizes to get smaller and orders to be placed more frequently. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p27.80">The result will be a smoother flow of orders that distributors and manufacturers will be able to handle more efficiently. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p27.80">Ordering costs can be reduced by using electronic ordering technology. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p27.80">Transportation costs can be reduced by using third party logistics suppliers (3PLs) to cost effectively pick up many small shipments from suppliers and deliver small orders to many customers. [3] </s>

</div2>
<div2>
<head>2.4) QUANTITY DISCOUNTS</head>
<p n="p28.80">
<s n="s1.3;p28.80">The basic EOQ formula assumes that the purchase price per unit will be the same regardless of the number of units ordered. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p28.80">However, vendors often lower the unit price as the quantity ordered increases, because the lowered unit cost of shipping and handling the order. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p28.80">When quantity discounts are offered, such savings reduce unit acquisition costs still further as the order size increases. [3] </s>
