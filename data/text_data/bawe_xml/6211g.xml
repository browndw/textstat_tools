<p n="p1.14">
<s n="s1.2;p1.14">The sheer bulk of material written about Herodotus and Egypt has, unsurprisingly, constrained me to focus upon a particularly narrow aspect of Herodotean scholarship, namely the veracity of his historical methods and his relationship with his predecessor Hecataeus. </s>

<p n="p2.14">
<s n="s1.3;p2.14">Debate concerning the veracity of Herodotus' historical methods and his relationship to his predecessor Hecataeus has been raging at least as far back as the late nineteenth century. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p2.14">It would be almost impossible to comment upon both aspects separately as both are interrelated. </s>

<p n="p3.14">
<s n="s1.3;p3.14">There are arguably three main schools of thought concerning our inquiry. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p3.14">The third is relatively recent and the other two have been in competition with each other for a considerable length of time. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p3.14">The essential arguments of the two older schools have remained unaltered over time, though in some cases slight details have been revised. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.14">
<s n="s1.3;p4.14">One school argues that Herodotus is telling us the truth and that the details of his account can be matched to corresponding Egyptian evidence. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p4.14">They frequently attribute inaccuracies either to genuine misinterpretation by Herodotus, or alternatively genuinely innocent or deliberately construed misinformation by his sources. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p4.14">I have managed to trace this school back to Sourdille<ref target="BAWE_6211g-ftnote.001"/> and Wiedemann<ref target="BAWE_6211g-ftnote.002"/> at the turn of the twentieth century, though it is probable that the school is older. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p5.14">The other school, named the 'Liar school' by Kendrick Pritchett<ref target="BAWE_6211g-ftnote.003"/>, advocates that Herodotus either created wholly fabricated accounts, due to the fact that he never went to Egypt, or similarly he copied and adapted passages from Hecataeus. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p5.14">The oldest scholar I have found who claims that Herodotus was fabricating his account is Sayce<ref target="BAWE_6211g-ftnote.004"/> who states that 'The majority of the statements made by Herodotus about Egyptian matters are now known to be false, and ... there are many in which we can trace a deliberate intention to deceive'<ref target="BAWE_6211g-ftnote.005"/>. </s>

<s n="s2.3;p7.14">From the 1970's and 1980's onwards the numbers have evened out somewhat, quite possibly due to the emergence of a third 'school' that has gathered pace ever since. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p14.14">It appears that the current state of affairs has the 'Ethnographic School' enjoying a numerical superiority over the Liar and 'Misinterpretation' Schools. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p14.14">Yet there are adherents for both of the older schools. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p14.14">The irony is that the tide may well have turned against the Liar School. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p14.14">Their attempts to overturn what they have deemed overly favourable interpretations by the 'Misinterpretation School', have been seemingly made obsolete by the 'Ethnographic School', which argues that both of the older schools are outdated and no longer worth pursuing in the intensive manner, which was undertaken by past scholars. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p14.14">For many modern scholars, ethnographic coherence is far more important than the practically impossible task of determining whether passages originate from Hecataeus or Herodotus. </s>
