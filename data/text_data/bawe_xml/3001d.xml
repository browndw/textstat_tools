<s n="s1.2;p2.22">The notion of 'chaos' influencing the 'mind' and 'passions' is a direct reflection upon issues of the self, the category of the individual, which permeated the literature and philosophy of the nineteenth century, due to the economic, religious and social upheavals caused by advances in science, the debate on slavery and industrialisation, all of which disrupted the class structure. </s>

<s n="s4.6;p4.22">Whilst Faust desired 'certainty,' Manfred desires 'self oblivion,'<ref target="BAWE_3001d-ftnote.007"/> to lose his subjectivity, in order to return to a place of innocence and surety. </s>

<s n="s12.17;p7.22">Coleridge and Wordsworth were renowned for their pastoral idyllic descriptions; the incongruent killing of the albatross therefore is highly significant, because not only has it often been compared to the crucifixion of Christ, but the bird also appears domesticated and poses no threat when it came 'everyday, for food or play." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3001d-ftnote.019"/>
<s n="s13.17;p7.22">The murder appears entirely arbitrary, unprovoked and the Mariner displays no signs of repentance. </s>
<s n="s14.17;p7.22">This produces an ambiguous moment of transgression, which is complicated further by the arbitrary judgement of the other sailors. </s>
<s n="s15.17;p7.22">Similarly, when the Mariner encounters the 'water-snakes'<ref target="BAWE_3001d-ftnote.020"/> he twice remarks 'I blessed them unaware.' </s>
<s n="s16.17;p7.22">These actions suggest the Mariner is not in control of either virtuous or immoral events, this problematises the Mariner's agency and subjectivity. </s>
