<s n="s1.5;p93.94">When loaded in small increments, the sensitivity of the system was calculated at 11.428 VN <hi rend="sup">-1</hi> with no apparent limit of linearity. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p93.94">This was because the rig did not allow loading anywhere near the estimated maximum allowable load of 2.89 N. Therefore linearity was assumed to continue up till V <hi rend="sub">max</hi> = 33 Volts. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p93.94">The ability to apply greater loading forces would allow the true limit to be determined more accurately. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p93.94">To improve the sensitivity of the system, the simplest and most effective solution would be to decrease the thickness of the beam, as this has an exponential effect upon the strain. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p93.94">All other parameters in the system have a linear relationship with strain so any change would not result in such a significant resultant change. </s>

<p n="p94.94">
<s n="s1.3;p94.94">The rig once connected to the analogue-to-digital converter produced graphs that enabled the resonant frequency to be determined as 20.4 Hz. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p94.94">The time required for the system to settle once oscillated is approximately 2 seconds. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p94.94">The integration of a simple low-pass filter significantly reduces noise, as can be seen between Graph 2 and Graph 3. </s>
