<head rend="bold">Summary</head>
<p>The purpose of this experiment is to understand the method of force measurement. There are several ways of sensing force, as for this experiment, strain gauges are used to do the measurement. As applying an external force to a balanced system, the strain of the strain gauges is changed results in the resistance changes, then output voltage changes due to the change of the resistance. As a result, the relationship between the applied force and the system output can be found out.</p>
<p>The force sensor which is going to be measured and tested consists of three parts. They are a cantilever rig, a Wheatstone bridge circuit and an amplifier. The cantilever rig and the Wheatstone bridge form an analogue experimental transducer. Two strain gauges which are bonded onto the cantilever beam are part of the bridge circuit. After adding forces to the transducer, the output voltage signal is very small therefore the amplifier is used to increase the output.</p>
<p>The experiment is mainly divided into five steps. First of all, the force range can be applied has to be determined to make sure the system will not be damaged. Secondly, a Wheatstone deflection bridge circuit is designed and built in order to convert the change in resistance of the two strain gauges to an output voltage. Thirdly, an amplifier is designed and built in order to amplify the output to an appropriate level. Fourthly, the complete force sensor system can be tested so that the relationship between the output and loading force can be found out and plotted on a graph, in this process, all signals are in analogue format, therefore it can be considered as an analogue test. Lastly, analogue signals can be converted into digital format by computer software in order to do some further processes.</p>
<p>The relationship between the system output and applied force is expected to be a straight line. However, in practice, the result is not linear as there are some factors affecting the system such as temperature effect and measurement misplays. On the digital analysis part, the output waveform against time can be seen from the computer. For further testing, the system outputs with and without applied force are compared. Also, a feedback capacitor produces a significant effect to the output.</p>
