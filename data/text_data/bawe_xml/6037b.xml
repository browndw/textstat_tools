<head rend="underlined">Discussions and Conclusions</head>
<p n="p24.27">
<s n="s1.6;p24.27">The expected result should have shown that heat treatment of the defatted soya bean extracted inactivates or reduces trypsin inhibitor and therefore reduces trypsin inhibitor activity. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p24.27">However, this was not shown in experimental results as the unheated samples had a slightly lower percentage inhibition at 78.4% than the heated sample at 80.2%. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p24.27">As the difference in the percentage inhibition was minimal at 1.8%, this result may have been due to experimental error. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p24.27">Possible causes for the experimental error or why these results were obtained include inadequate heat treatment or the samples may not have been heated for long enough for the inhibitor to be inactivated. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p24.27">The yellow colour obtained increased in intensity when the absorbance was high. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p24.27">This was because there was more BAPNA broken down and a smaller amount of trypsin inhibitor present. </s>
</p>
<p n="p25.27">
<s n="s1.2;p25.27">The reproducibility of the results may be difficult as the results did not correspond to literature trends and the extent of heat treatment is quite difficult to control. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p25.27">However the method is mostly appropriate for this analysis and replicates taken in absorbency values ensure that the results are reliable. </s>
</p>
<p n="p26.27">
<s n="s1.3;p26.27">The literature value for trypsin absorbency with no trypsin inhibitor is approximately 0.400 (Liu, 1997). </s>
<s n="s2.3;p26.27">The experimental value obtained was 0.389 at 410 nm and close to the literature value. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p26.27">The range of absorbance for the difference samples should have varied between 0.10 and 0.40 and the majority of the data obtained did lie within this region. </s>
</p>
<p n="p27.27">
<s n="s1.3;p27.27">The trypsin inhibitor in the reaction reduced the BAPNA and trypsin to produce p-nitroaniline. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p27.27">Trypsin inhibitor inactivation by heat treatment is important because trypsin inhibitor works by blocking the enzyme trypsin from digesting the protein. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p27.27">The trypsin inhibitor in soyabeans needs to be inactivated as it allows for increased protein quality and prevents growth inhibition, so it is safe for consumption. </s>
