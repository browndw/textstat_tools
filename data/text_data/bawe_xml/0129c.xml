<s n="s1.5;p1.16">The concept of globalisation is an ambiguous one. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p1.16">Perhaps the most universal and unbiased definition states that it is "the closer integration of the countries and peoples of the world ... brought about by the enormous reduction of costs of transportation and communication and the breaking down of artificial barriers to the flows of goods, services, capital, knowledge and (to a lesser extent) people across international borders"<ref target="BAWE_0129c-ftnote.001"/> (Stiglitz, 2002, 9). </s>
<s n="s3.5;p1.16">However, there are those who claim that globalisation is not as new a concept as purported. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p1.16">Eslake goes as far as saying that "Globalization is the logical extension of the tendency towards increased specialization and trade which has been going on more or less continually since humans first appeared on the surface of the earth." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0129c-ftnote.002"/>
<s n="s5.5;p1.16">(Eslake, 2003, 2) Whether or not globalisation is a new phenomenon, its costs and benefits will here be analysed and this essay will conclude in arguing that the process creates losers and winners and what is important is for those better off to protect and subsidise others. </s>

<p n="p2.16">
<s n="s1.8;p2.16">There are four strands of thought to consider when concerning the effects of globalisation. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p2.16">
<hi rend="italic">Sceptics</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Deregulators</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Reversers</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Internationalists</hi> all have diverse and conflicting opinions on the causes and solutions of the process. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p2.16">Firstly, <hi rend="italic">Sceptics</hi> believe that the international integration arising as a product of globalisation has in fact not reduced the reallocative or regulative competence of the states and that there has not been a devolution of state sovereignty to a new global order. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p2.16">The balance of power between different groups within countries is the soul cause of action and thus states are still able to function. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p2.16">
<hi rend="italic">Deregulators</hi>, on the other hand, contest this argument but perceive the loss of state jurisdiction as a beneficial process that allows the further allocation of resources and limits state interference. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p2.16">
<hi rend="italic">Reversers</hi> see globalisation as a constraint on public policy making and seek to reverse this effect through a process of 'Renationalisation', restoring national boundaries, protecting sovereignty and preserving democratic governance. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p2.16">Finally, Internationalists advocate the creation of an effective system of global governance aimed at making politics as global as economics. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p2.16">Through the cooperation of states and the formulation of a multifaceted cosmopolitan democracy, the creation of a global regulatory framework that functions at the same level as economic interaction can be achieved. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.16">
<s n="s1.5;p3.16">When considering globalisation, a phenomenon with such broad implications in both politics and economics, there is rare occasion for positive statements and often one is left considering the advantages and disadvantages of its effects in order to form a vague normative assertion. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p3.16">In order to ascertain an answer to the question "Is increased globalisation a good thing?" a similar process must be followed. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p3.16">The current effects of globalisation on the world must be considered, and a balanced conclusion must be made as to whether furthering these effects would be beneficial and to whom. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p3.16">Therefore, what follows is an analysis of the positive and negative effects of globalisation. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p3.16">This is not exhaustive, as the full implications of globalisation could never fully be realised, let alone summarised in an essay of this length. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.16">
<s n="s1.4;p4.16">One of the optimistic intentions of globalisation is for the increase in the range of goods and services available to the world consumer, the increase in the distance over which such transactions can be executed, the increase in the speed with which they occur, and the decrease in the overall cost of the overall process. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p4.16">This has tended to lead to the evolution of individual and indeed social preferences in favour of increasing diversity in the range and origin of goods and services. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p4.16">Saul Eslake sees this process as "facilitated by improvements in education and in communications technologies ... [and] self- reinforcing"<ref target="BAWE_0129c-ftnote.003"/> (Eslake, 2003, 1). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p4.16">This transnational flow is not limited to goods; the increased flow in communication between countries and across cultural boundaries can often lead to a mutual appreciation of 'universal' values such as freedom, democracy, human rights and private economic enterprise. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p5.16">This can, and should in the eyes of <hi rend="italic">Deregulators</hi>, have the affirmative outcome of a further reduction in trade barriers due to reciprocal agreements between nations, or even as a consequence of unilateral liberalisation. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p5.16">The fact that this process is a product of sovereign states exercising their discretion and not of imperial conquest, may suggest that globalisation is a tool by which the self-perpetuating liberal west 'educates' other states and may be paralleled to Gramsci's theory of the Historic Bloc. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p5.16">Indeed, Gramsci recognised this occurrence when writing "Every relationship of 'hegemony' is necessarily an educational relationship and occurs not only within a nation ... but in the international and world-wide field"<ref target="BAWE_0129c-ftnote.004"/> (Gramsci, 1996, 666). </s>
<s n="s4.5;p5.16">Though Gramsci opposed the process of the Historic Bloc, his theory concurs with Friedman's definition of globalisation as "the spread of free market capitalism to virtually every country in the world"<ref target="BAWE_0129c-ftnote.005"/> (Friedman, 1999, 8). </s>
<s n="s5.5;p5.16">Friedman has a more positive outlook on the end result and embraces the inevitability of the subsequent manifestation of a true world culture, encompassing cultural products, languages and images that are shaped and understood on a global platform. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p6.16">One of the main problems associated with this effect is the idea of a homogenised world; whether Cultural Hegemony, Westernisation or Americanisation, the idea that we will end up in a global monoculture is a dangerous one. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p6.16">However, despite the certain existence of this global culture, there should not be a necessity for global uniformity. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p6.16">The theory of comparative advantage can work in terms of culture, and as each specific culture is amalgamated into the transnational structure, it will bring with it its own specific advantages in terms of traditions, beliefs and values. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p6.16">It will, in fact be beneficial to be diverse and distinguishing; the new world economy, as opposed to the current set of faintly unified national economies, will profit from an increase in prosperity, choice and range. </s>

<p n="p7.16">
<s n="s1.5;p7.16">Though states may benefit from a global culture, they may also profit from the process of specialisation and comparative advantage in an economic sense. </s>

<s n="s3.5;p7.16">(Davies, 2000, 3) If countries specialise in what they are best at, the global industry will benefit. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p7.16">This is facilitated namely by low transport costs and allows companies like Mattel to produce Barbie dolls through four specialised countries for less than it would cost to manufacture entirely in the USA. However, Davies argues that specialisation should not be limited to countries and that internal specialisation should be encouraged as much as possible as this leads to further efficiency in the allocation of resources. </s>

<s n="s3.5;p8.16">This emphasis on the individual over the state may have significant consequences if globalisation were to continue; it may undermine the necessity for a nation state and promote decentralisation. </s>

<s n="s4.4;p9.16">Though it may be said that in general, the benefits made available to consumers as a result of globalisation outweigh the hardships imposed on businesses from foreign competition, there is still the problem of the governments inadequacy in providing sufficient recompense, income support or retraining services for those negatively affected in this manner. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p16.16">Stiglitz offers a resolution to the current overclass situation: voting power in institutions such as the IMF and World Bank should be less skewed; there should be an increase in the transparency of decision making and an overall change in the approach to crisis management; a change in the rules on bankruptcy when countries are unable to pay their national debt should be considered and there should be further concern for employment and working conditions.<ref target="BAWE_0129c-ftnote.014"/> (Stiglitz, 2003, 47-67) However, these conditions are fairly <hi rend="italic">Internationalist</hi> and assume that politics should be as flexible as economics in the global sphere. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p16.16">It can also be argued from a <hi rend="italic">Sceptic</hi> point of view that globalisation has not undermined nationhood as a primary framework of collective solidarity, but has helped to loosen some links between nations and states for the better. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p16.16">Therefore, the question of whether or not globalisation is a good thing and should therefore be increased is almost entirely dependent on the point of view one takes; whether a <hi rend="italic">Sceptic</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Deregulator</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Reverser</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Internationalist</hi>, the problems and solutions of globalisation will vary. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p16.16">However, one theme is clear throughout all stems of thought: globalisation, whether a new phenomenon or not, needs to be treated with great caution and respect, the process may create losers as well as winners and what is important is for those better off to protect and subsidise others in order to maintain equality and preserve the good name of globalisation. </s>
