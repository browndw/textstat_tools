<s n="s1.3;p1.21">Having read the given detailed account, it can be seen that certain incidents occurring in the story could be deemed criminal offences, for which either Felicity or Amy, or both, could be potentially liable. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p1.21">In the following paragraphs I will endeavour to identify and explain these offences and conclude whether or not the two could indeed be made criminally liable for them, whilst considering the scope of the applicable criminal law and the principle of fair labelling. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p1.21">I have fragmented this essay accordingly, so as to deal with each identifiable offence in turn. </s>

<s n="s2.2;p2.21">based on the given information, for the sake of this essay it seems practical to treat both defendants as co-principals in the commission of the first two offences mentioned. </s>

<div1 type="section">
<head rend="underlined bold">1. The Offence of Theft</head>
<p n="p3.21">
<s n="s1.12;p3.21">Felicity and Amy were successful on two occasions in implementing their plan to steal mobile phones from train passengers. </s>
<s n="s2.12;p3.21">Based on the given information, it appears that both parties would be liable for the offence of theft. </s>
<s n="s3.12;p3.21">Turning to the relevant statutory provisions contained in the Theft Act 1968, we can see how this is so. </s>
<s n="s4.12;p3.21">Ashworth's useful interpretation of section 1 of the Act breaks down the statutory requirements into five elements - three relating to conduct and two to the fault requirement: there must be (i) an <hi rend="italic"> appropriation</hi>; of (ii) <hi rend="italic">property</hi>; which (iii) <hi rend="italic">belongs to another</hi>; with (iv) an <hi rend="italic">intention of</hi> <hi rend="italic">permanent deprivation</hi>; and that this be done (v) <hi rend="italic">dishonestly</hi>
<ref target="BAWE_0069a-ftnote.001"/>. </s>
<s n="s5.12;p3.21">These conduct and fault requirements should be looked at in turn in relation to the actions and intentions of the two defendants, so as to decipher their liability conclusively. </s>
<s n="s6.12;p3.21">Firstly, the mobile phones that Felicity and Amy targeted did not belong to them but were under the possession of others (it seems justifiable to assume this, as we are told the phones were removed from others' bags/coats - an indication of their ownership), and yet they secretly took them into their own possession, thus being <hi rend="italic">appropriated</hi> in the eyes of the law. </s>
<s n="s7.12;p3.21">A mobile phone clearly comes under the scope of the definition of 'property' detailed in s. </s>
<s n="s8.12;p3.21">4(1) of the Act as including '<hi rend="italic">money and all other property, real or personal...'</hi>. </s>
<s n="s9.12;p3.21">Elements (i), (ii) and (iii) are hence satisfied; the conduct is criminal. </s>
<s n="s10.12;p3.21">The defendants' intentions to permanently deprive can be assumed as it is highly unlikely that the appropriation was intended only to be temporary. </s>
<s n="s11.12;p3.21">The phones were also taken without the consent of those who owned them and it cannot be argued that any of the stipulations contained in s. </s>
<s n="s12.12;p3.21">2, where appropriation would not be considered dishonest, could apply (i.e. the defendants obviously did not believe they either had a <hi rend="italic">legal right</hi> to take the phones nor that they would have been given <hi rend="italic">consent</hi> if their victims had known of the circumstances - the simple fact that they were carrying rulers to mimic concealed weapons shows that this would not be the case as they foresaw the owners' objections to their acts). </s>

<s n="s1.2;p4.21">Felicity and Amy therefore appear to be liable for this offence; the provisions of the 1968 Act can be applied without difficulty. </s>

<s n="s2.6;p5.21">1(1) establishes that a defendant will be liable for this offence if they perform "<hi rend="italic">an act which is more than merely preparatory to the commission of the offence".</hi> </s>
<s n="s3.6;p5.21">Their actions clearly meet this requirement in that not only did the two <hi rend="italic">plan</hi> to thieve, they went as far as reaching into their victim's coat and looking in their pockets for the object they desired. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p5.21">The statute also requires <hi rend="italic">intention</hi> to commit the offence. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p5.21">Obviously, the girls showed such intention by secretly inspecting the Caroline's pockets in the hope of acquiring a phone. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p5.21">The fact that they had already stolen two phones in such a way would, if proven in court, greatly assist their prosecution also. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.21">
<s n="s1.9;p6.21">However, difficulty lies in the fact that there was actually no phone in the pockets to steal; it was impossible to commit the intended offence. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p6.21">In determining liability in such a situation the courts appear somewhat ambiguous. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p6.21">In <hi rend="italic">Partington v Williams</hi>
<ref target="BAWE_0069a-ftnote.002"/> it was held that there could be no liability in such cases "<hi rend="italic">because the commission of the substantive offence was, in the circumstances, impossible</hi>
<ref target="BAWE_0069a-ftnote.003"/>". </s>
<s n="s4.9;p6.21">However, contrasting this decision is the case of <hi rend="italic">Bayley and Easterbrook</hi>
<ref target="BAWE_0069a-ftnote.004"/> where defendants were convicted of "<hi rend="italic">attempting to steal not the actual contents but something, unidentified, that was not in the box</hi>
<ref target="BAWE_0069a-ftnote.005"/>". </s>
<s n="s5.9;p6.21">Clearly, the potential liability depends on the approach adopted by the court in each case. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p6.21">If an act-centred approach is taken, whereby the defendants are judged on the consequences they intended to happen, liability may be escaped. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p6.21">However, it appears the trend<ref target="BAWE_0069a-ftnote.006"/> is to embrace a fault-centred approach suggesting a person should be judged on facts/circumstances as they believed them to be at the time. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p6.21">Felicity and Amy obviously thought that there was a phone in Caroline's jacket pocket and took action based on this assumption to secretly investigate the jacket in the hope of appropriating it. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p6.21">If this could be proven, liability for attempted theft may be imposed. </s>

<s n="s3.3;p8.21">The scope of the law in this area can be criticised, as it purports to convict those who's acts are, somewhat loosely defined, as being 'more than merely preparatory', revealing a relatively broad approach to criminalisation in this area. </s>

<s n="s4.11;p11.21">This line of argument is however likely to fail for several reasons. </s>
<s n="s5.11;p11.21">The law of self-defence turns on two requirements: that "<hi rend="italic">the force must have been necessary, and it must have been reasonable"</hi>
<ref target="BAWE_0069a-ftnote.012"/>. </s>
<s n="s6.11;p11.21">We are not informed of any action taken by Caroline that could possibly necessitate the subsequent action of Felicity, and therefore she is unable to justify her reaction as being reasonable, nor necessary. </s>

<ref target="BAWE_0069a-ftnote.013"/> suggests that this may be the case, where Lord Morris stated<ref target="BAWE_0069a-ftnote.014"/> that it is "most potent evidence" of reasonableness that the defendant only did what they "honestly and instinctively thought necessary". </s>
<s n="s9.11;p11.21">A court adopting this approach would greatly benefit Felicity's defence, yet it would be very unlikely to assume such a sympathetic perspective in such a situation involving the doctrine of prior fault (i.e. the attempted theft which had induced the subsequent scene of confrontation between defendant and victim). </s>
<s n="s10.11;p11.21">Furthermore, the requirement that a reaction in self-defence must be proportionate to the nature of the threat would defeat Felicity's defence argument. </s>
