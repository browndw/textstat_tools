<s n="s3.11;p1.63">The examples of this are pattern recognition, linear prediction, adaptive filtering, monitoring and fault detection. </s>

<s n="s6.11;p1.63">Dynamic characteristics of such system depend on many factors such as speed and loading, which might change over time. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p1.63">Adaptive control is the area concerned with design of controllers and regulators in order to adjust controlled parameters. </s>

<s n="s6.11;p63.63">Based on these results, it seems that Model3 using ARX model is optimal model for model representation of this dynamic system. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p63.63">In part C, the algorithms was implemented by using RLS algorithm including either Instrument Variables (IV) or a Moving Average noise model based on Pseudo Linear Regression in order to improve parameter estimation. </s>
