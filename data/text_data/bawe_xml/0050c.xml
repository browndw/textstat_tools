<s n="s1.1;p2.46">This assignment is about comparing the two most common, and probably reliable, methods of measuring inflation in the UK. Inflation can be defined as a sustained rise in the general level of prices and inflation rate is the rate at which the price level increases. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.46">
<s n="s1.2;p3.46">GDP deflator is a weighted average of the prices of different goods and services, where the weights represent the importance of each of the goods and services in GDP. It measures the price of output relative to its price in the base year, that is, it is an index number - set equal to 100 in the base year. </s>

<p n="p5.46">
<s n="s1.2;p5.46">In more detail, the GDP deflator can be calculated by dividing the YBEU by YBEZ and multiplying the value by 100. </s>

<s n="s1.1;p7.46">YBEU, or GDP index in current prices, can be obtained by the formula ∑PitQit; and subsequently, YBEZ (or GDP index at constant prices) is obtained by ∑Pi0Qit . </s>

<p n="p8.46">
<s n="s1.2;p8.46">By doing this I found out that the price index for the GDP deflator is a Paasche index. </s>

<head rend="underlined">CPI vs. GDP deflator</head>
<p n="p15.46">
<s n="s1.3;p15.46">In order to make the CPI series comparable with GDP deflator, the CPI figures had to be re-referenced. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p15.46">The re-referenced CPI figure could be obtained by dividing the original CPI figures by GDP deflator and multiplying by a hundred. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p15.46">Now the two series can be cross-referenced and compared. </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.46">
<s n="s1.2;p16.46">Although the CPI and the GDP deflator are both reliable measures of inflation in the UK, they each show different trends or movements in prices between the period 1997 Q1 and 2004 Q3. </s>

<p n="p17.46">
<s n="s1.3;p17.46">Using the 'data analysis' function of 'tools' in excel, I was able to compute the correlation coefficient of the two series, which worked out to be -0.9899 to four decimal places. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p17.46">The figure is very close to 1 which indicates that the two series are very closely linked and therefore do not vary too greatly. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p17.46">It is also a negative figure which signify that if one goes up, the other decreases and vice versa. </s>
</p>
<p n="p18.46">
<s n="s1.2;p18.46">Though the CPI and the GDP deflator move together most of the times, this is clearly not the case for our example above. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p18.46">The pink line, indicating the trend of the CPI, moves downwards where as the GDP deflator indicates that inflation is going up. </s>
</p>
<p n="p19.46">
<s n="s1.4;p19.46">Firstly, the GDP deflator is a price index measuring changes in prices of all new, domestically produced, final goods and services in an economy. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p19.46">The GDP deflator is not based on a fixed market basket of goods and services. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p19.46">The basket is allowed to change with people's consumption and investment patterns. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p19.46">Therefore, new expenditure patterns are allowed to show up in the deflator as people respond to changing prices. </s>
</p>
<p n="p20.46">
<s n="s1.2;p20.46">On the contrary, the CPI doesn't use all goods, rather it uses a specific basket of goods which consumers are likely to use. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p20.46">It measures the price of a fixed basket of goods and services purchased by a representative consumer over a given period relative to the price of the same basket in some base year. </s>
</p>
<p n="p21.46">
<s n="s1.1;p21.46">Briefly, the GDP deflator reflects the overall changes in price levels in the economy, while the CPI reflects more on what the consumer faces. </s>
</p>
<p n="p22.46">
<s n="s1.3;p22.46">Using CPI allows us to measure inflation facing consumers and using GDP is better for measuring the inflation in the economy as a whole. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p22.46">For instance, prices of imported goods will not be included in the GDP deflator. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p22.46">Therefore, the GDP deflator would not reflect the rise in the cost of living faced by consumers. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p23.46">The purpose of this assignment is to seasonally adjust time series effectively. </s>

</p>
<p n="p24.46">
<s n="s1.2;p24.46">To be a seasonal time series, the data when graphed must contain seasonal components. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p24.46">The aim of the seasonal adjustment is to smooth out and average out any seasonal factors so that the general trend can properly be observed rather than irregularities. </s>
</p>
<p n="p25.46">
<s n="s1.5;p25.46">The source of the data was ONS Databank online. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p25.46">Firstly I had to select a quarterly data series which had a seasonal component in it. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p25.46">Without it, it would serve no purpose for this assignment. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p25.46">To do this, I had to initially spend time exploring different series by selecting them and displaying them on-screen. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p25.46">I decided to use the Retail Sales Index (RSI) because the seasonality could be seen very clearly in the graph as a cycle within each year. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p26.46">Figures for Retail Sales Index (RSI) from 1994 to 2002, therefore, is given in table 1 under Xt. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p26.46">These figures indicate how much firms have been spending on retailing in each quarter of years. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p26.46">It can easily be observed from the data that in addition to having a general trend, they also fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to seasonal spending patterns. </s>
</p>
<p n="p27.46">
<s n="s1.3;p27.46">Once I had imported the data into Excel, I firstly singled out the period between 1994 Quarter 1 and 2002 Quarter 4, as required. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p27.46">It was then necessary to estimate the trend of the data. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p27.46">To do this, the averages over successive runs of four quarters were required. </s>
</p>
<p n="p28.46">
<s n="s1.2;p28.46">It is assumed that the RSI consists of a trend component (Tt), a seasonal component (St) and an irregular component (Rt). </s>

<s n="s2.3;p32.46">This gives the first trend value for the data because it smoothes out seasonal and irregular movements over the first four quarters. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p32.46">The process is then repeated by obtaining X*3.5 - by replacing quarter 1 of year 1 by the first quarter of year 2, that is, X₁by X5. </s>

<p n="p33.46">
