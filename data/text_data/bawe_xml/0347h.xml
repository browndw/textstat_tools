<s n="s1.2;p2.43">This report investigates into 4 materials that are commonly used in biomedical materials science. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p4.43">Within medicine, it is important that when materials are considered for use within the body, their properties are fully understood, so that no unexpected behaviour occurs. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p4.43">Mechanical failure could be potentially fatal, if the receiver of this technology is frail or affected by a debilitating disease. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p4.43">For example, an arthritis sufferer's newly fitted replacement hip, could fail at the top of a set of stairs, causing them to fall and severely injure other parts of their body. </s>

<p n="p5.43">
<s n="s1.2;p5.43">In order to understand these properties, thorough materials testing must be initiated. </s>

<s n="s1.1;p41.43">The values for Yield Stress, Tensile Stress and Strain were found, and most frequently were as expected from previous acknowledgments (within the Data Book), but these vary slightly, as the samples have had different heat treatments and processes to prepare them. </s>
