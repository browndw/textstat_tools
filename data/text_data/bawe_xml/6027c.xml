<p n="p1.12">
<s n="s1.7;p1.12">The Tamworth pig probably descended from the Old English Forest Pig from 1683 and is now extremely popular throughout Britain and also the World. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p1.12">They originate from the Midlands and the name derives from the Staffordshire town, Tamworth. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p1.12">The Tamworth has long legs, large pricked up ears, a long head and body, a straight belly and a distinctive red/ginger coat. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p1.12">Records show that this colour has not changed since the 1800's and importantly the coat prevents sunburn in summer. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p1.12">They are medium sized with Boars weighing between 535-800 pounds and Sows between 450-650pounds. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p1.12">Sows do not produce large sized litters compared to other breeds; normally about 6-10 piglets but they are very careful mothers. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p1.12">They are a slow maturing breed and are often known to be energetic yet not nasty, but pigs that enjoy life and are can be very affectionate. </s>

<div1 type="section">
<head rend="underlined bold">Statistics of the Tamworth</head>
<p n="p2.12">
<s n="s1.2;p2.12">The Tamworth is listed in the Rare Breed Survival Trust along with many other breeds of pigs. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p2.12">However, the Tamworth is seen as an endangered species due to only 223 breeding females left in the UK. </s>

</table>
<p n="p3.12">
<s n="s1.4;p3.12">This table shows how the Tamworth Pig is an endangered species and apparently there are less than 4000 in the world. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p3.12">The reason as to why these rare breeds are rare is because they do not fit in with modern day production systems. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p3.12">However, this can change if people stop thinking we should not eat rare breeds. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p3.12">Instead they need to be persuaded to possess these animals and eat them, because the demand is what will save them. </s>

<p n="p4.12">
<s n="s1.5;p4.12">This graph is a representation that the Tamworth Pig population had declined dramatically over the last 40 years. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p4.12">The above graph is only portraying data from Canada, which backs up the point that this is not only a localized problem but also a world wide one that is being addressed. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p4.12">Around 1885, exports of the Tamworth Pig to other countries around the world occurred, including America and Australia. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p4.12">In 1877, Canada received the Tamworth Pig but in the mid 1960's a decline occurred due to many reasons such as competition from other breeds and also new regulations. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p4.12">Between 1998 and 2003, 251 registrations were recorded, but from the graph you can see since 1970 slight fluctuations have occurred, showing how the registrations vary from just a few pigs up to just over a 100. </s>

<div1 type="section">
<head rend="underlined bold">Why should the Tamworth be conserved? </head>
<p n="p5.12">
<s n="s1.4;p5.12">There are many reasons as to why the Tamworth should be saved. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p5.12">The bacon and pork has a great quality due to the length and depth of the body and the proportion of fat to lean red meat is very favourable. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p5.12">In the 1990's, out of commercial and rare breed pigs, the Tamworth came out top according to a 'taste test' performed by Bristol University. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p5.12">The Tamworth saw a decline due to competition by mass marketers; hence one of the reasons to preserve the Tamworth is that it would more benefit from a niche market due to its high quality meat. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.12">
<s n="s1.7;p6.12">Another reason is that the Tamworth is exceptionally good at being reared on pastures. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p6.12">It has a long snout which means it is very good at clearing an area, especially woodland. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p6.12">It is an ideal animal for any gardener who wants their land cleared. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p6.12">Being a descendant of the Old English Forest Pig means they suit rough woodlands and forests. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p6.12">They are a disease resistant pig and can cope with extreme temperatures. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p6.12">Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI's) have been created for Conservation measures for these pigs. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p6.12">In which they graze on environmental areas such as National Parks and Nature Reserves. </s>
</p>
<figure id="BAWE_6027c-pic.002"/>
<p n="p7.12">
<s n="s1.2;p7.12">The photo above shows woodland cleared by Tamworth pigs. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p7.12">The pigs are extremely happy to live outside and be able to wander freely throughout brambles and bracken in which they remove by grazing. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.12">
<s n="s1.4;p8.12">Another reason for saving this breed is that cross breeding can occur. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p8.12">In the 18 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> Century, most breeds were crossed with others, however the Tamworth was not, hence it is known as a pure breed. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p8.12">Today, the Tamworth is used to cross with other breeds such as the Berkshire, in order to produce good quality meat. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p8.12">Some breeds do not produce exceptionally good meat, so by crossing them with a Tamworth they benefit much better. </s>

<head rend="underlined bold">Survival</head>
<p n="p9.12">
<s n="s1.7;p9.12">Tamworth Pigs have so many reasons and benefits as to why they should be saved and kept alive. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p9.12">How they are saved is the question though. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p9.12">DNA testing save and safe guarding existing genetics and developing a breeding strategy are all possibilities. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p9.12">Technology still needs to be developed so that the freezing of semen, embryos and tissues can be improved, in order to save certain breeds like the Tamworth. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p9.12">The Rare Breed Survival Trust (RBST), which was established in 1973, has ensured that no British farm animal has been wiped out and the Trust relies heavily on donations to carry out its work. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p9.12">Rare Breed Farms are found in the UK and are essential in order to preserve and maintain these rare breeds. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p9.12">Kentwell Hall, in Long Melford, Suffolk has a Rare Breed Farm in which Tamworth pigs are kept and looked after. </s>
</p>
<figure id="BAWE_6027c-pic.003"/>
<p n="p10.12">
<s n="s1.4;p10.12">In 1978, Kentwell received its first Tamworth Pigs and have bred them ever since. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p10.12">Places such as Kentwell Hall, are essential in order to preserve Rare Breeds, such as the Tamworth Pig. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p10.12">Thousands of visitors arrive each year and this also helps to promote the rare breeds and prove how important it is to conserve them so they do not go extinct. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p10.12">This is an example of commercially exploiting a rare breed like the Tamworth. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.12">
<s n="s1.5;p11.12">The market is extremely important for rare breeds because it is here that will decide the fluctuations of the population. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p11.12">The Tamworth is a rare breed partly because it can not keep up with market needs, therefore it has become rare. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p11.12">Today, supermarkets require specific conditions so many breeds suffer. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p11.12">So, in 1994, The RBST created a scheme in which individual butchers' offer different breed meats so the consumer has a variety of tastes. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p11.12">An example of this is Powters Ltd, Newmarket, Suffolk. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.12">
<s n="s1.4;p12.12">In conclusion, The Tamworth pig is in danger and without Trusts and places such as The RBST and Kentwell Hall, the Tamworth maybe extinct. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p12.12">The Tamworth is now seen on an international scale, despite it being a rare breed. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p12.12">With its good quality meat, grazing benefits and cross breeding, the Tamworth is defiantly worth saving. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p12.12">It just needs more people and the market to realise what an important, yet efficient animal it is. </s>
