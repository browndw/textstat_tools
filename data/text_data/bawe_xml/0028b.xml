<p n="p13.43">
<s n="s1.5;p13.43">Sintering is a simple process whereby a particular mineral or set of minerals in powder form are heated to a high temperature less than the melting point, where the particles bond to each other, producing a porous material. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p13.43">The material usually shrinks significantly, and often the sintering process occurs in a die with a compaction pressure. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p13.43">The vacuum in space generally helps this process. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p13.43">The heat can come from either direct solar energy and/or microwave. </s>

<p n="p14.43">
<s n="s1.2;p14.43">The result is a fairly low density material which can be cut and shaped fairly easily, can hold small loads in compression, and provides good thermal insulation, but cannot take much stress in tension and is brittle. </s>

<p n="p15.43">

<s n="s2.2;p15.43">The belt and the heating elements are of a modified 80/20-nickel/chromium alloy and give a useful life at temperatures up to 1150°C. A tube furnace usually has gases that consist of 95% nitrogen and 5% hydrogen. </s>

<s n="s1.1;p16.43">The tensile strength E <hi rend="sub">n</hi> of sintered iron powders is insensitive to sintering time, alloying, or particle size in the original powder, but is dependent upon the density (D) of the final product according to<formula notation="" id="BAWE_0028b-form.001"/> where E is Young's modulus and d is the maximum density of iron. </s>

<s n="s2.3;p34.43">It is observed that the graph line is not straight, but the trend line can be used to calculate the pressure at which <hi rend="sub">g</hi> = <hi rend="sub">i</hi>. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p34.43">This is the density of iron that is listed in the design specification. </s>
</p>
<p rend="ordered" n="p35.43">
<s n="s1.2;p35.43">Using the length of the uncompressed powder measured at the beginning of the powder compaction stage, the apparent density of the powder in the die cavity, <hi rend="sub">p</hi>, was determined (Table 2). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p35.43">This density is affected by factors such as a change in the amount of powder that is put into the die, the manual pressure that is applied to it, and the measurements of the external and bore radius of the die. </s>
</p>
<p n="p36.43">
<s n="s1.3;p36.43">The apparent density is so called because at the stage when the length L <hi rend="sub">p</hi> was measured, the powder had only undergone manual compression, and not the load of the hydraulic press. </s>

<s n="s3.3;p36.43">Hence, <hi rend="sub">p</hi> was not the final density of the bearing. </s>
</p>
<p rend="ordered" n="p37.43">
<s n="s1.2;p37.43">The laboratory process seemed to be suitable for small-scale processing of bearings, but inappropriate for any large-scale manufacturing. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p37.43">This is because the laboratory process involved the measurement of the powder by weight, which was time consuming and hence, cannot be used on an industrial level. </s>
</p>
<p n="p38.43">
<s n="s1.2;p38.43">A better method to fill the die would be the measurement of the powder required for the bearings by volume. </s>

<p rend="ordered" n="p39.43">
<s n="s1.2;p39.43">The laboratory highlights that fact that changing one variable during the process of manufacture alters the end product, but a change in another variable can prevent the alteration of the product. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p39.43">For example, an increase in the mass of the powder will change the density of the bearing, but the length can also be decreased to keep the density constant. </s>
</p>
<p rend="ordered" n="p40.43">
<s n="s1.4;p40.43">Referring to Table 3, it can be observed that not all the bearings have final measurements that fall under the product design specification listed in the laboratory handout. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p40.43">Hence, the values that are highlighted in bold are those that are the correct final values. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p40.43">The bearing that was loaded with a compaction pressure of 2.0 Tons from our final product seems to be most suitable for the manufacture of required bearing. </s>
