<s n="s1.2;p8.38">Naturalistic inquiry takes a holistic perspective and postulates that those who have the experiences are most knowledgeable about them (Depoy and Gitlin, 1998). </s>

<s n="s1.3;p9.38">To increase credibility, data will be collected using a variety of research methods, and from different sources. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p9.38">This process in know as triangulation and can enhance the rigour of the research (Mays and Pope, 2000; Taylor, 2000; Robson, 2002). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p9.38">Therefore, three hand clinics are being included in this study rather than one, and in order to answer the research questions, three forms of data collection will be conducted: </s>

<p rend="ordered" n="p11.38">
<s n="s1.1;p11.38">Participants will be asked to keep a diary for 4 weeks, to keep a record of when/if they practice the exercise and splinting regime in their own time, and when/if they attend appointments to see the OT.

<s n="s1.2;p15.38">Participants will be invited to participate in one to one interviews with the researcher. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p15.38">The interviewer's appearance should be similar to the interviewee's so as not to come across as too authoritative, and the interviewer should try to make the interviewee comfortable in expressing their true experiences (Robson, 2002; Streubert and Rinaldi Carpenter, 1995). </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.38">
<s n="s1.4;p16.38">Semi-structured interviews are appropriate where a study focuses on the meaning of particular phenomena to the participants (King, 1994, cited in Grbich, 1999); they are therefore the most appropriate interview design for this study. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p16.38">Semi-structured interviews have predetermined questions, but the order in which they are asked can be modified based on what the interviewer feels is most appropriate. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p16.38">The wording, order and explanations of the questions can vary, and questions which seem inappropriate with a particular interviewee can be omitted, or additional ones added (Robson, 2002). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p16.38">The design of semi-structured interviews enables interviewees to elaborate on their answers, and the interviewer to ask probing questions, so comprehensive data can be obtained (See table 2, 'The 4 Components of Asking'). </s>
</p>
<p n="p17.38">
<s n="s1.5;p17.38">In the initial interview, participants will be asked open questions about their attending of appointments and whether they follow the exercise and splinting regime, and in what ways they think it helps. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p17.38">Further and probing questions will be asked, depending on the answers given. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p17.38">Probes are neutral statements which do not bias the subject to respond in any particular way. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p17.38">They are used to encourage more information, or elaborations, for example, "tell me more about it" (Depoy and Gitlin, 1998). </s>
<s n="s5.5;p17.38">Summary questions are also useful at the end of an interview, to enable the interviewer to check they have understood the interviewee correctly (Grbich, 1999). </s>
</p>
<p n="p18.38">
<s n="s1.4;p18.38">The second interview will provide an opportunity to expand, verify and add descriptions to the phenomena being researched. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p18.38">The researcher can refer to limited or inadequately described information to gain further descriptions. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p18.38">Often, the participants will also have additional thoughts about the phenomena, following the initial interview (Streubert and Rinaldi Carpenter, 1995). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p18.38">The second interview will take place after the 4 weeks that the participant has kept a diary, and will also be an opportunity to discuss what is written in the diary. </s>

<head rend="italic">Audio taping</head>
<p n="p19.38">
<s n="s1.2;p19.38">Audio taping is a fundamental data-recording strategy in naturalistic inquiry. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p19.38">Participants must be informed that they are being recorded, so they can give their consent, and they are also to be informed that confidentiality will be maintained, and that they can request the audio-taping to cease at any point (Depoy and Gitlin, 1998). </s>
</p>
<p n="p20.38">
<s n="s1.4;p20.38">Grbich (1999) notes that there is a tendency for respondents to engage in casual conversation on the topic, once the tape recorder has stopped, commenting reflectively on what they have just said. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p20.38">The author says that this 'off-the-record' data often allows the interviewer to see what is behind the interviewee's recorded responses, and the researcher should make a mental note of what had been said and write up these observations as soon as possible after the interview. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p20.38">However, doing this means that information is from the researcher's memory, and not from a reliable source; therefore it could have been misinterpreted and would lead to incorrect data. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p20.38">For the purpose of this study, this will not be recommended; instead, the interviewer will be encouraged to write about any such events in their diary. </s>

<head rend="italic">Transcribing the interviews and field notes</head>
<p n="p21.38">
<s n="s1.3;p21.38">The interviewer will transcribe the interviews verbatim from the audio tapes rather than during the interview. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p21.38">However, whilst in the interviews, notes will be kept of how the interviewee expresses themselves in other ways in relation to the questions being asked, for example, if they are upset, laughing, or demonstrating with their hands. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p21.38">Any relevant expressions will subsequently be added to the transcriptions to give further depth (Robson, 2002; Streubert and Rinaldi Carpenter, 1995). </s>

<p n="p23.38">
<s n="s1.2;p23.38">There are a number of issues in phenomenological research due to its personal nature, and consent should be viewed as an ongoing process (Streubert and Rinaldi Carpenter, 1995). </s>

<p n="p36.38">
<s n="s1.2;p36.38">A strategy to ensure credibility and trustworthiness of the data will be to involve participants in the analysis of the research, by giving them access to the transcribed data, and also the researcher's interpretations of it, and allowing them to comment on the research (Taylor, 2000). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p36.38">This is known as member checking (Mays and Pope, 2000; Robson, 2002). </s>
