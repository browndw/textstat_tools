<p n="p32.51">
<s n="s1.4;p32.51">Regulation in CAM plants is important, as cycles of carboxylation and decarboxylation, and malate storage and release, can easily occur with no advantage to the plant at the cost of ATP. PEP carboxylase, Pyruvate kinase, and Pyruvate phosphate dikinase are three key enzymes that have to be regulated. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p32.51">PEP carboxylase is regulated so that when CO <hi rend="sub">2</hi> is released by malate decarboxylation it is not immediately refixed. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p32.51">Pyruvate kinase must be regulated in the dark so that it does not compete with PEP carboxylase for the available PEP and pyruvate phosphate dikinase is regulated by light and contributes to regulation in NAD(P)+-malic enzyme type plants (1). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p32.51">The regulation of PEP carboxylase and Rubisco is in time rather than space as they are found in all chloroplast containing cells; PEP carboxylase is active only in the dark, and Rubisco active only in the light. </s>

<head rend="bold italic">Significance in relation to environment</head>
<p n="p33.51">
<s n="s1.1;p33.51">CAM is very typical of plants in environments exposed to droughts such as semi-deserts, shallow soils or in the epiphytic environment in tropical forests (1) as it has the ability to minimise water loss. </s>
</p>
<p n="p34.51">
<s n="s1.4;p34.51">The succulent property of many of these plants enables their survival as the large vacuoles and low surface area to volume ratio acts improves water storage. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p34.51">The water-use efficiency is also increased by the leaves taking in CO <hi rend="sub">2</hi> for fixation at night whilst the temperatures and vapour pressure deficit of the air compared to the leaf are much lower, therefore minimising transpiration. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p34.51">For example <hi rend="italic">Agave desertii</hi> has a water vapour concentration difference of 7 times greater at 20 <hi rend="sup">o</hi>C than 5 <hi rend="sup">o</hi>C (1). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p34.51">Anatomical features minimising water loss in CAM plants include think cuticles and reduced stomata size and frequency compared to C <hi rend="sub">3</hi> or C <hi rend="sub">4</hi> plants (3). </s>
</p>
<p n="p35.51">
<s n="s1.2;p35.51">Thanks to the water conserving properties, CAM plants lose 50-100g of water per gram of CO <hi rend="sub">2</hi> gained, compared to 400-500g for C <hi rend="sub">3</hi> plants. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p35.51">C <hi rend="sub">4</hi> plants are better at water conservation than C <hi rend="sub">3</hi> plants losing 250-300g but CAM are by far the most efficient in this respect (2). </s>
</p>
<p n="p36.51">
<s n="s1.6;p36.51">CAM plants are able to adjust their CO <hi rend="sub">2</hi> uptake according to the changing environmental conditions. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p36.51">For example the ice plant <hi rend="italic">Mesembryanthemum crystallinum</hi> can convert to CAM from C <hi rend="sub">3</hi> in response to stress signals such as heat, water or salt stress. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p36.51">This requires the regulation and expression of several CAM genes (18, 19). </s>
<s n="s4.6;p36.51">Other species are able to alter their metabolism to take in CO <hi rend="sub">2</hi> in the daytime if sufficient water is available to maximise carbon gain without forfeiting water. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p36.51">Many plants demonstrate facultative CAM, and all are C <hi rend="sub">3</hi> as seedlings. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p36.51">Some CAM plants, such as the Aizoaceae <hi rend="italic">, Mesembryanthemum crystallinum</hi> germinate in the early part of the year when water is plentiful, and CAM is onset in the dry seasons that follow (1). </s>
</p>
<p n="p37.51">
<s n="s1.3;p37.51">Some CAM plants react to prolonged drought very severely, by sealing the stomata and shedding the roots. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p37.51">This prevents gas exchange, but the internal cycling of CO <hi rend="sub">2</hi> continues. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p37.51">In this state photoinhibition is prevented and the plant can respond immediately to water availability (2). </s>
</p>
<p n="p38.51">
<s n="s1.3;p38.51">CAM is found in aquatic vascular plants, which is at first thought to be strange as they do not require water saving mechanisms. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p38.51">However this is because daytime CO <hi rend="sub">2</hi> availability (caused by water conserving closing of the stomata) becomes rate limiting for photosynthesis, caused either by high diffusional resistances limiting access to CO <hi rend="sub">2</hi> or competition from other species (13). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p38.51">This is a second similarity between most CAM plants. </s>

<p n="p39.51">
<s n="s1.2;p39.51">In cyanobacteria and microalgae, Rubisco has a particularly low affinity for CO <hi rend="sub">2,</hi> therefore operating far below its maximal specific activity (1) and the K <hi rend="sub">m</hi>(CO <hi rend="sub">2</hi>) can be greater than 200 µM, which is high compared to C <hi rend="sub">4</hi> plants. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p39.51">To increase the CO <hi rend="sub">2</hi> concentration at the site of Rubisco and to try to out compete the high levels of atmospheric O <hi rend="sub">2</hi>, they concentrate CO <hi rend="sub">2</hi> internally by the use of CO <hi rend="sub">2</hi> and HCO <hi rend="sub">3</hi>- pumps at the plasma membrane. </s>

<p n="p40.51">
<s n="s1.2;p40.51">Microalgae cannot stop the CO <hi rend="sub">2</hi> escaping by thickened cell walls as C <hi rend="sub">4</hi> plants do as they consist of one to a few cells, each of which can easily access the environment. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p40.51">They need therefore to have cell walls that can prevent the leakage of CO <hi rend="sub">2</hi>, whist allowing the entry of other nutrients. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p41.51">To do this, firstly these organisms accumulate HCO <hi rend="sub">3</hi>- (as well as CO <hi rend="sub">2</hi>) which being charged has a greater diffusion resistance and therefore diffuses out through the membranes more slowly than CO <hi rend="sub">2</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p41.51">The cells take up both CO <hi rend="sub">2</hi> and HCO <hi rend="sub">3</hi>- by active uptake driven by ATP derived from light reactions (2). </s>
<s n="s3.6;p41.51">The HCO <hi rend="sub">3</hi>- must be converted back to CO <hi rend="sub">2</hi> to be used as the substrate for Rubisco. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p41.51">It is thought that Rubisco is packaged into the cell at a specific location within the chloroplast of the cell, and the action of carbonic anhydrase then quickly generates higher CO <hi rend="sub">2</hi> levels from bicarbonate in the chloroplast than elsewhere, a process favoured in the plastid stroma alkaline conditions in the light. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p41.51">This has been observed by an increase in CA activity in multiple compartments upon induction of CCM. This specific chloroplast location is the pyrenoid, which is a structure specific to the chloroplasts of certain algae and hornworts (6). </s>
<s n="s6.6;p41.51">The CO <hi rend="sub">2</hi> can then be used by Rubisco and consequently the Calvin cycle, before it diffuses out of the cell or is out competed by O <hi rend="sub">2</hi> (4). </s>
</p>
<p n="p42.51">
<s n="s1.2;p42.51">Secondly cyanobacteria and microalgae are effective at scavenging CO <hi rend="sub">2</hi> that is leaking out from both the chloroplast to the cytoplasm, and the cell to periplasmic space (6). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p42.51">It is thought that the peculiar internal structure of microalgae such as the localization of rubisco in the pyrenoid, the starch envelope and the concentric thylakoid membranes contribute to the effective CCM and low amount of CO <hi rend="sub">2</hi> loss (6). </s>
</p>
<p n="p43.51">
<s n="s1.1;p43.51">The gene responsible for the transcription factor controlling this apparatus is only induced in low CO <hi rend="sub">2</hi> conditions so as not to be wasteful in the cells' energy by expressing genes that are not required (1). </s>
</p>
<p n="p44.51">
<s n="s1.2;p44.51">The result of this CO <hi rend="sub">2</hi> concentration mechanism in low CO2 conditions for the cells is that oxygenation of Rubisco is suppressed and therefore so is photorespiration. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p48.51">It can be seen be looking at three major mechanisms how plants overcome the problem of Rubisco having a low affinity to CO <hi rend="sub">2</hi>, the competitor O <hi rend="sub">2</hi>, and the leakage of already accumulated CO <hi rend="sub">2</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p48.51">All three of the mechanisms work to concentrate CO <hi rend="sub">2</hi> at the site of Rubisco in slightly different ways, and it can be concluded that the mechanism varies according to the environment in which they live, and that further variations exist within each type discussed. </s>
