<s n="s1.5;p1.27">The rise in deaths due to infection in hospitals generates a need for research into the control of infection; including the area of hand washing. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p1.27">Human hands play a large role in the transmission of infection; hand washing is a simple but successful method of protecting patients from infections (UKCC, 1992). </s>
<s n="s3.5;p1.27">It has been identified that the problems with hand washing lie within the technique used not the hand washing agent (Larson, 1995). </s>
<s n="s4.5;p1.27">Evidence based practice is essential in healthcare which is why research must be completed before practice is changed (Barnard &amp; Seale, 1998). </s>
<s n="s5.5;p1.27">It has been questioned whether the technique used in hand washing is the main factor in the effectiveness of soap based products; this study will investigate this issue using a quantitative approach. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p9.27">The research uses a randomised controlled trial (RCT) which is an unrelated-subject experimental design. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p9.27">Using a RCT allows the researcher to see the effect of a treatment or intervention, usually establishing cause and effect. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p9.27">The experiment is carried out in an attempt to reject the null hypothesis thus support the alternate hypothesis (Hicks, 2002). </s>
<s n="s4.7;p9.27">The design will use two groups; an experimental group and a control group (known as the experimental arm and the control arm). </s>
<s n="s5.7;p9.27">It is important that both arms come from the same population and are as identical as possible, except for the intervention which they are receiving. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p9.27">The experimental arm will receive training on a new technique of hand washing. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p9.27">The control group will not receive this training and will wash their hands according to their existing method of hand washing. </s>

<head rend="bold">Sampling and Participants</head>
<p n="p12.27">
<s n="s1.3;p12.27">A large number of participants should be used in order to increase the external validity of the study, allowing generalisation of results to the population (Gleitman, Fridlund &amp; Reisberg, 2004). </s>
<s n="s2.3;p12.27">For such large clinical trials, a statistician will be consulted for power calculations working out how many participants should be involved. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p12.27">It is likely that approximately three hundred participants will be used. </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.27">
<s n="s1.4;p13.27">Six hospitals will be chosen at random from around the UK and approximately fifty participants will be selected from each hospital, depending on the power calculation. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p13.27">In each hospital, a computer will randomly select the participants from a staff list. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p13.27">Permission is needed to gain access to these. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p13.27">Random sampling will increase external validity and ideally represent the whole population. </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.27">
<s n="s1.4;p14.27">Once sampling is completed and consent given by the participants, the hospitals will be randomly allocated to the experimental or control arm of the study. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p14.27">Randomisation ensures there is an equal chance of each hospital being allocated to either arm. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p14.27">The participants will be allocated in hospital groups so all participants in that hospital will be using the same technique. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p14.27">Separating the arms will increase validity, as the experimental arm will be unable to discuss the study with the control arm, leading to knowledge of the technique being passed on. </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.27">
<s n="s1.6;p15.27">To randomly allocate the hospitals, six envelopes will be randomly sent by a third party informing the hospitals which arm they are participating in. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p15.27">This method ensures there is no selection bias, and the researcher will be unaware which hospitals are in which arm of the study. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p15.27">When using unrelated-subjects the groups of participants should be equivalent at the baseline therefore matched for confounding variable such as age, gender and socio-economic status. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p15.27">This is essential so that differences in the outcomes become attributable to the intervention and not to inherent differences between participant groups. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p15.27">Random selection should ensure the groups are similar; however there may still be anomalies. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p15.27">Therefore once participants have been selected, the group's characteristics will be checked, for example to check the group is not all male doctors. </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.27">
<s n="s1.3;p16.27">Blinding will be used so the researcher does not know which participants are in which arm of the study; limiting the risk of researcher bias. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p16.27">Those collecting the data will also be unaware of participant's allocation. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p16.27">Participant blinding is not practical due to the nature of the intervention. </s>

<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">Intervention</head>
<p n="p17.27">
<s n="s1.3;p17.27">The intervention received by the three hospitals in the experimental arm is the teaching of a new hand washing technique. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p17.27">The technique will be taught in a laboratory with standardised instructions thus ensuring the study is replicable. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p17.27">Participants in the control arm will not receive training and will continue to use their existing technique. </s>

<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">Confounding variables</head>
<p n="p18.27">
<s n="s1.3;p18.27">Confounding variables should be manageable as the study is laboratory based. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p18.27">It is easier to control the surrounding environment because it will be the same for each study. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p18.27">Confounding variables relating to participant characteristics cannot be easily controlled; however using a random sampling method should ensure that the groups are all comparable meaning it is less of an issue. </s>

<p n="p19.27">
<s n="s1.6;p19.27">Once training is completed, participants will be tested in the laboratory. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p19.27">They will be asked to wash their hands using a soap-based hand washing product with the technique assigned to their arm. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p19.27">They will be asked to place their right hand flat in a petri dish; this method of data collection has been chosen as opposed to using swabs as it is easier to replicate. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p19.27">Participants will be instructed and observed by a third party who have no involvement in the analysis of results. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p19.27">Before the experiment each participant will be randomly allocated a number and their petri dishes will be labelled with this. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p19.27">This is so they can be analysed in no particular order and maintain anonymity. </s>
</p>
<p n="p20.27">
<s n="s1.3;p20.27">The outcome measure is the number of bacteria on the right hand after washing. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p20.27">The number of bacteria in the dishes will be recorded for each participant; counted and verified by two people to avoid human error thus increasing reliability. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p20.27">The data collected will be interval data as the numbers have real value, are continuous, and can be manipulated. </s>

<p n="p21.27">
<s n="s1.5;p21.27">At this stage the results will be matched with the participants to compare the two arms. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p21.27">Distribution curves will be drawn for each arm and measures of central tendency calculated. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p21.27">The mean (average), the median (the central number in ordered data), and the mode (the most frequent number) will be displayed on the curve (Hicks, 2002). </s>
<s n="s4.5;p21.27">If these measures all fall on the centre of the curve then the data has a normal distribution and parametric statistical tests can be used; if not then the data is said to be skewed and non-parametric tests must be used. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p21.27">With a normal distribution the standard deviation will be calculated; the smaller this value is the more meaningful the results are (Polgar &amp; Thomas, 2000). </s>
</p>
<p n="p22.27">
<s n="s1.2;p22.27">The statistical test most likely to be used is the T test (unrelated),as the study uses one variable, two experimental conditions, and different participants in each condition. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p22.27">The data collected is interval data meaning that a parametric statistical test can be used; however this assumes the data has a normal distribution. </s>
</p>
<p n="p23.27">
<s n="s1.4;p23.27">Probability tables will be used to gain a <hi rend="italic">p</hi> value; this value shows how likely it is that the results occurred purely by chance (Hicks, 2002). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p23.27">The level of probability accepted in this study is p&lt;0.05; there is a one in twenty chance that results occurred by random chance. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p23.27">Increasing the level of significance would makes results more meaningful however could make a type I error by accepting the null hypothesis when there are actually significant differences. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p23.27">The large number of participants and the ability to control confounding variables should mean a type II error would not be made by accepting the alternate hypothesis when there are in fact no significant differences. </s>

<head rend="bold">Ethical considerations</head>
<p n="p24.27">
<s n="s1.4;p24.27">All participants will be given a fully detailed information sheet to gain informed consent, there must be no coercion of participants. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p24.27">A full risk assessment will be performed and indemnity held by Oxford Brookes. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p24.27">Participant details and results will be treated and stored confidentially and anonymously. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p24.27">Participants may withdraw from the study at any time (British Psychological Society, 1998). </s>
</p>
<p n="p25.27">
<s n="s1.3;p25.27">The main ethical issue in this research is whether it is ethical for the control group not to receive the advanced hand washing training. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p25.27">However this group are not uneducated and will be treating their patients using the existing method. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p25.27">The experimental group will not use the new technique in practice until research is complete as there is currently no evidence to suggest it is an advanced method. </s>

<head rend="bold">Limitations</head>
<p n="p26.27">
<s n="s1.3;p26.27">The experimental arm will have had more recent hand washing training which may influence how strictly they follow the technique thus influencing the results. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p26.27">A further confounding variable may come from having numerous instructors of the technique, however the use of standardised instructions should limit this. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p26.27">The study has low external validity due to it being laboratory based, however numerous steps have been taken to increase external validity and reliability. </s>
