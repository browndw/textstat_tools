<s n="s2.13;p4.11">The wind direction was mostly westerly, occasionally veering south westerly. </s>
<s n="s3.13;p4.11">To the west of the observing site there was a distance of approximately 150 m of short grass, which was bounded by a number of trees. </s>
<s n="s4.13;p4.11">Roughness length for cut grass would be expected to be approximately 6 x 10 <hi rend="sup">-3</hi> m (Stull 1988). </s>
<s n="s5.13;p4.11">This is fairly consistent with the results obtained, with the roughness length calculated for A and B being slightly larger, and for C slightly smaller. </s>
<s n="s6.13;p4.11">The fetch of 150 m would only allow reliable measurements of the wind up to approximately 1.5 m above the surface. </s>
<s n="s7.13;p4.11">In this experiment the wind was measured up to 6.4 m above the surface, which may have caused the values for A and B to be larger. </s>
<s n="s8.13;p4.11">It can also be seen that each set of readings appears to have one slightly anomalous result which does not fit the logarithmic curve. </s>
<s n="s9.13;p4.11">In each case it is the measurement taken by the anemometer at 2.24 m height. </s>
<s n="s10.13;p4.11">This could indicate that this instrument is not functioning properly, but an alternative explanation could be that the wind above this height is being affected by the trees surrounding the observing site. </s>
<s n="s11.13;p4.11">This effect was tested by recalculating the log plot using first just the data up to 2.24 m, then just the data from 2.24 m upwards. </s>
<s n="s12.13;p4.11">This gave two new values each for u* and z, one for the lower wind and one for the upper wind. </s>

<p n="p6.11">
<s n="s1.7;p6.11">It can be seen from Table 1 that the friction velocity of measurement A was larger than B and C, which were quite similar. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p6.11">The value of u* is dependant on wind speed, so this would be expected to be largest for A, were the average wind was stronger, and similar for B and C. The roughness length is largest for A and smallest for C. The log wind profile is only strictly valid in neutral conditions, so the most obvious explanation of these changes is that conditions were unstable for measurement A then became increasingly less unstable for B and C. However, this explanation is only partly supported by observation. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p6.11">There was direct sunlight on the observation site until shortly before the observations took place, so conditions may have been quite unstable initially. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p6.11">There was, however, much more direct sunlight during C than B, which should have led to more instability. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p6.11">There are also other factors which could have affected the amount of turbulence and hence the values of u* and z. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p6.11">A slight change in wind direction could have had an effect, by altering the fetch, or by causing the wind to blow over some of the other apparatus in the observing site. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p6.11">A roughness length of less than a centimeter would be easily affected in such circumstances. </s>

<s n="s1.9;p7.11">The teachpro spreadsheet was used to simulate vertical wind speed and temperature profiles, and investigate how these are affected by varying u* and T*. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p7.11">A larger value of u* gives a more rapidly increasing and larger wind speed. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p7.11">As wind speed increases, there is greater wind shear, and therefore more shear production of turbulence, and corresponding greater vertical momentum flux (u*). </s>
<s n="s4.9;p7.11">The overall stability of the profile is determined by T*. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p7.11">When T* is negative, sensible heat flux H is positive and temperature is highest at the surface, leading to unstable conditions. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p7.11">The wind speed tends towards a constant value as z increases (Figure 2a). </s>
<s n="s7.9;p7.11">When T* is very small, temperature is almost constant with height, meaning conditions are neutral, and H is very small. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p7.11">The wind profile is logarithmic (Figure 2b). </s>
<s n="s9.9;p7.11">As T* increases, H becomes negative and the temperature is reduced at the surface, giving stable conditions and a wind profile that becomes linear as z increases (Figure 2c). </s>
