<head rend="bold">What does the website cover? </head>
<p n="p4.32">
<s n="s1.6;p4.32">Aesthetically, the Fathers 4 Justice website has a bleak and unprofessional appearance. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p4.32">The font used for the website is rather small, which not only makes the writing look more dense and daunting, but can cause difficulties for people with poor eyesight; although the text can be adjusted via the internet settings. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p4.32">It seems that little time and thought has gone into the fashioning of the design, and it has tried to disguise this with its bold black background and purple logo. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p4.32">The black background, far from legitimizing the website's appearance, gives it an overbearing and intimidating tone which somewhat reflects the way people view Fathers 4 Justice and its approach to political activity. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p4.32">The first thing that appears when the Fathers 4 Justice website is loaded is the ever-present logo in the top left-hand corner, and the list of contents below it, giving easy to access to the different sections. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p4.32">The home page comprises of press articles which is not the most striking of layouts and does not help give a good first impression of the site. (<hi rend="italic">Appendix I</hi>) </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.32">
<s n="s1.2;p5.32">It is interesting to compare this to the website of the pressure group 'Families Need Fathers', which has similar objectives as Fathers for Justice, but more of an insider status. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p5.32">They look more towards consulting with government and giving advice to families in need rather than direct action.<ref target="BAWE_0275a-ftnote.004"/> This is reflected in the design of the website: The layout has a more light-hearted, less forceful tone, achieved by the yellow background and a 'happy' picture of a father reading to a child. </s>

</note>
<p n="p6.32">
<s n="s1.6;p6.32">The Fathers 4 Justice website is made up of eleven clearly labelled sections. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p6.32">Two of these have been made redundant since the closure of the organisation: listings of events are no longer available, and new members are not being accepted. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p6.32">However, application for membership was once an available option, and the sign up process appears to be fairly straightforward. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p6.32">But as the website is not very inviting, a person would have to be quite committed to the causes of the organisation to consider becoming a member. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p6.32">There was also the possibility of making an online donation to either the British faction or the American one; or of purchasing merchandise online. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p6.32">This not only contributes to the finances of the group, but also to the spread of publicity and support. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.32">
<s n="s1.6;p7.32">There are few images on the website and these are only small thumbnails which cannot be expanded to a reasonable size. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p7.32">The limited number of photos can only be found by clicking on the 'F4J in action' link or the section about Pierce Brosnan. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p7.32">This makes the website stark in comparison to those of other pressure groups. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p7.32">For example, when accessing the 'Greenpeace' web page, one is greeted with an outburst of colour and vivid images, making the website eye-catching. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p7.32">Fathers 4 Justice could perhaps benefit from this example, and make their website more appealing. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p7.32">Dressing up as superheroes or as Father Christmas' has provided the media with great visual tools and it is a shame that Fathers 4 Justice does not harness this to enhance the webpage. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.32">
<s n="s1.1;p8.32">There is also a lack of other resources such as radio extracts or videos, which could also be a useful tool for attracting and maintaining people's attention. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.32">
<s n="s1.3;p9.32">It is plausible, nevertheless unlikely, that the simplicity of the website may be intentional: By keeping the information short and easy to access Fathers 4 Justice are more likely to get the desired message across, and people can get an overall impression of the organisation by having a quick glance through the website. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p9.32">Having a cluttered website with an excess of information can be overwhelming and discouraging for the reader. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p9.32">Also, the website downloads almost instantaneously which is a positive feature. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.32">
<s n="s1.2;p10.32">However the website has a comprehensive press section which is to be commended, as it provides the reader with an expansive source of information about the organisation, and the way in which it is run. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p10.32">It also helps legitimise the organisation's claims and standing by providing thoughts other than those engineered by Fathers 4 Justice, trying to create a good image. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.32">
<s n="s1.4;p11.32">The website provides an introduction to the formation of the organisation and its aims and objectives. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p11.32">Using short and bold facts, and an explanation of its 'legacy', Fathers 4 Justice has tried to add credibility to its name, and gain the reader's support. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p11.32">This is demonstrated by the 'Pledge' signed by Matthew O'Conner, attempting to incite compassion and give the website a personal feel.<ref target="BAWE_0275a-ftnote.005"/> Fathers 4 Justice has also tried to encourage people to take an interest in the campaign by highlighting the support Pierce Brosnan and Bob Geldorf have for the organisation. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p11.32">The website has various emboldened quotes by Bob Geldorf such as: "I cannot believe what is done to parents in the name of the law"<ref target="BAWE_0275a-ftnote.006"/>, trying to validate its cause. </s>

<s n="s3.3;p13.32">I have been told that the English website is under development, and a new one will soon be launched which resembles the new Dutch one: <seg type="URL" n="http://www.f4j.nl"/>. </s>

<p n="p14.32">
<s n="s1.3;p14.32">There are considerable differences between this website and the current English one, and all the criticisms made so far would have become redundant had the new website been launched sooner. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p15.32">How can the effectiveness be judged? </s>
<s n="s2.7;p15.32">What criteria should be used? </s>
<s n="s3.7;p15.32">There is no way of knowing definitively whether a particular campaign has been successful, or if a government's change in policy is directly related to the actions of a particular group. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p15.32">This makes the evaluation of effectiveness an extremely hard task to undertake. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p15.32">When attempting to find out how effective a pressure group has been, consulting those who have taken part in the group, or in this case, examining the group's website is a good place to start. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p15.32">However, one must be aware of the bias which will dominate the information. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p15.32">A pressure group will attempt to give itself a favourable image, and most likely exaggerate its achievements. </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.32">
<s n="s1.4;p16.32">For single issue groups, it is easier to judge whether or not they have succeeded with their objectives by whether or not these have been achieved. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p16.32">However, groups often have multiple objectives and so their effectiveness is not only related to only one thing. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p16.32">Fathers 4 Justice claim that there are still one hundred children a day who "lose partial or total contact with their fathers in the UK"<ref target="BAWE_0275a-ftnote.008"/>; and court action related to the 1989 Children's Act has not changed,<ref target="BAWE_0275a-ftnote.009"/> and so in this respect its fight for 'justice' has failed. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p16.32">However the issue of parents' rights has been forced up the political agenda, which is a considerable feat, further strengthened by the origin of the group in other countries. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p17.32">One of the main questions regarding the effectiveness of pressure group activities is how it attempts to influence government. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p17.32">The methods employed relate to both the type of group in question, and the resources it has available. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p17.32">The approach undertaken by Fathers 4 Justice is to create publicity and awareness through high profiled stunts to try and shape government policy making. </s>
</p>
<p n="p18.32">
<s n="s1.3;p18.32">The success of a pressure group also depends on the issue it deals with and the type of political system within which it operates. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p18.32">But there is often more than one pressure group with the same policy agenda.<ref target="BAWE_0275a-ftnote.010"/> How can one be sure that a government shift in opinion is due to the actions of Fathers 4 Justice rather than the 'similar' group "Families Need Fathers"? </s>

<s n="s1.4;p29.32">Fathers 4 Justice has only 12,000 members,<ref target="BAWE_0275a-ftnote.026"/> partly because it was only set up a few years ago and never had the time to build up the repertoire other groups such as the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds have been able to. </s>

<s n="s3.4;p29.32">In terms of actual activists, Fathers 4 Justice only uses a selection of core members, and so thousands of activists are not required to make a stand. </s>

<s n="s3.5;p31.32">The press release also alleges that the pressure group will refrain from carrying out the more outrageous stunts, but will instead take a more respectable approach to UK politics. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p31.32">It seems that Fathers 4 Justice has perhaps learnt that its direct action tactics were not the most successful in implementing change, and is now attempting to negotiate with the various institutions of the state, to perhaps gain more of an insider status. </s>

<s n="s2.6;p32.32">Although Fathers 4 Justice has captured the attention of the media on several occasions, its portrayal has not always been positive and there is little proof that it has had a lasting effect on the shaping of government policies. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p32.32">The fact that the group was disbanded earlier this year is perhaps evidence of its own failure in realizing its objectives. </s>
