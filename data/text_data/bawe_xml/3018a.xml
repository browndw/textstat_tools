<s n="s4.7;p5.36">Due to the nature of the layout there will be a space at the far right end of the marquee where the guests will enter. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p5.36">This was deliberately done to enable a welcoming area where guests can have their welcome drinks and generally wait without being cluttered around the tables. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p5.36">The bar will be placed in the lower right corner. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p5.36">It will not be in the way during service but is useful for the drinks reception at the start as the bar will be nearest to the guests. (<hi rend="bold">Please see appendix A</hi>) </s>
