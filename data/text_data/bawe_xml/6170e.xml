<s n="s3.4;p25.168">The issue of confidentiality is essential in many areas, e.g. in business - there is a strong need to protect strategic plans, research data, product information, personnel data etc. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p25.168">We cannot allow other companies to access our data and copy our ideas as it could lead to bankruptcy of our venture. </s>
</p>
<p n="p26.168">
<s n="s1.1;p26.168">Another important case, where confidentiality plays an important role is internet banking - allowing strangers to access our account or read our credit/debit card details can result in stealing money from our account. </s>

<p n="p27.168">
<s n="s1.2;p27.168">Now that we have proved the importance of data protection against unauthorized access we should think who is responsible for determining which data need to be confidential, what the level of protection should be and who is authorized to access and change the data. </s>
