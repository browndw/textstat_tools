<s n="s5.9;p1.11">Nationalities including Ukrainians, Polish and Armenians made this a multi-cultural, multi-religious country which was very hard to generalise about demographically. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p1.11">In terms of classes, Russia had some more traditional groups such as peasants, landowners, autocracy and merchants. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p1.11">Whilst also having some modernising classes such as industrialists, foreigners and intelligentsia. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p1.11">Politically, Russia was run by a single autocratic monarch, seen as ordained by God. </s>

<s n="s2.3;p2.11">Secondly, I plan to look in some depth at the main reasons given by historians on why this revolution 'failed'. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p2.11">Finally I will conclude by suggesting that although the 1905 revolution did not result in a full revolution, this was not its aims, therefore simply classifying it as a failure may not be appropriate. </s>

<s n="s1.8;p3.11">'Until 1905 the struggle against the autocracy was predominantly an affair of individuals and small groups...it was only in that year that the Russian masses...were stirred in to action on a larger scale." </s>

<s n="s2.8;p3.11">The 1905 revolution was the response of the people (or at least some of them) to years of hardship and harsh autocratic rule. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p3.11">It was perhaps the taste for change they felt under Tsar Alexander II (such as peasant emancipation) that led them to question Tsar Nicholas II when he took measures to strengthen autocratic rule.<ref target="BAWE_0010a-ftnote.003"/> The expansion of Russian industry during the 1890's '...was succeeded by a period of depression and industrial conflicts became sharper and more numerous." </s>

<s n="s4.8;p3.11">Strikes, though illegal were becoming more common at this time. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p3.11">Propaganda spread by revolutionaries and the intelligentsia was beginning to reach and interest workers disillusioned by working conditions and unfair treatment by superiors. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p3.11">The peasantry still carried their resentment at the government and landowners over their emancipation which left them tied to the land by the increased power of the village commune, and forced to make redemption payments to the state.<ref target="BAWE_0010a-ftnote.005"/> The peasants saw themselves as rightful owners of the land because they were they ones who tended it. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p3.11">They seem to have borne this bitterness quietly until they sensed their old enemies growing weak in 1905; and turned on the landed and wealthy. </s>

<s n="s8.8;p3.11">Also at this time, poverty and even starvation were not uncommon and were arguably enhanced by government policies which built up huge foreign debts. </s>

<s n="s4.7;p4.11">Bloody Sunday was a non-violent protest to the Tsar, by workers and their families, about poor working conditions, and poor relations with managers. </s>

<s n="s3.9;p6.11">The urban factory workers were angry that they had to work such long hours in such poor conditions, the main reason that they took to striking was due to managers ignoring their wishes and maltreating them.<ref target="BAWE_0010a-ftnote.016"/> The slowly emerging middle and upper classes remained largely loyal to the Tsar until the bloody Sunday disaster, which created more uncontrollable disorder.<ref target="BAWE_0010a-ftnote.017"/> Landowners, capitalists and the urban rich supported the autocracy whilst it was able to control the masses and protect property. </s>

<s n="s2.10;p7.11">As Christopher Read points out, it was not necessarily the 'implications and nuances of the changes taking place' in 1905 which led to the unrest, it was more the fact that these changes '...were being contained within a stubbornly unchanging framework..." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0010a-ftnote.018"/>
<s n="s3.10;p7.11">By easing this unchanging framework with the concessions made in reaction to the demonstrations, the government was able to maintain their position of power. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p7.11">Faced with sympathy strikes, general discontent from people of all classes, the dismay of other European countries, as well as a fear that the army's loyalty was lessening, the government was forced in to conceding to certain public demands. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p7.11">The October Manifesto was able to quell discontent to a large extent; the upper classes felt that they now had some control, whilst the lower classes felt that they had won a small victory on which they could build upon. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p7.11">The Manifesto, though using very vague terminology, and lacking the Tsars sincere approval, promised Russia a more democratic society; that this manifesto infact changed little, perhaps helped lead to a different outcome for the autocracy in 1917. </s>

<s n="s7.10;p7.11">However, the Manifesto's mixture of reassurance of the Tsars' care for his people, sorrow at their current situation, and assurance of future amendments proved enough to ease the political tension; at least for long enough to ensure the Tsar had ensured the safety of his position. </s>

<s n="s1.10;p8.11">Differences between the situation in 1905 and 1917 help highlight its 'failure'; for example, although it could be argued that almost all sections of the Russian population were against the Tsar in 1905, the situation in 1917 was more acute. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p8.11">The opposition was more ready for action, the concessions made in 1905 had been proved insincere, scapegoats for the people's continuing misery such as Russian minorities, had grown angry and organised, and the army defied orders. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p8.11">Moreover, central to the 'failure' of the 1905 revolt, was the reality that its aims were initially not political, but were in fact economical. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p8.11">The strikers wanted better working conditions, and the peasants' land reform, though some sections of the opposition such as the intelligentsia were looking towards a more democratic society, many wanted to accommodate these changes within the existing Tsarist framework. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p8.11">The aims of 1905 were not revolution for the majority of people. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p8.11">Instead their aims seem to have been in search of better life conditions and above all to be listened to by their managers, and the authorities; and at least to some extent these aims were realised in 1905. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p8.11">Through striking, managers were forced to pay attention to their subordinates, and some changes such as a shorter working day were implemented. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p8.11">Likewise, although the sincerity of the October Manifesto, as well as the Tsars' support of it can be questioned, it was still a concession the autocracy were forced to make. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p9.11">To conclude, I approached this question by setting the context by briefly mentioning some of the key characteristics of Russia. </s>

<s n="s3.6;p9.11">These are important to understand why 1905, which could have ended in the overthrow of the Tsar, did not. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p9.11">For example, the fact that the peasants held grievances with the landed elite rather than the Tsar himself meant that when they got the chance to act on their anger the Tsar was safe. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p9.11">Similarly the fact that the workers wanted reform rather than revolution is also significant in understanding the nature of 1905. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p9.11">The causes of the 1905 revolution did not spontaneously appear in that year, however a mixture of factors meant that peoples long felt disillusionment with the government and their situation, could finally be expressed. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.11">
<s n="s1.7;p10.11">The reason why the culmination of all these grievances as well as the poor initial reaction to protest of the government, did not end with full revolution can not be put down to one single cause. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p10.11">That the aims of the broad cross section of society involved in the uprising were not revolution, is I think, very important. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p10.11">That so many sections of the vast population were involved, from the rich, to the ethnic minorities, peasantry to the intelligentsia, white collar workers to foreigners, factory workers to capitalists makes it surprising perhaps that revolution did not occur. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p10.11">However, revolutionary activity was unorganised partly because previously there had been no perceived need for revolution. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p10.11">Other important factors include that this was the first time that confidence in and loyalty to the Tsar was severely challenged. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p10.11">Also, the fact that at this point the Tsar still had scapegoats available to him, in the form of his ministers as well as vulnerable groups in society meant he was still trusted when the October Manifesto was announced. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p10.11">By 1917 the Tsar himself had become the scapegoat, saving the ruling class from blame, he had allowed himself to be put in a position where he could not escape blame; conducting the war. </s>
