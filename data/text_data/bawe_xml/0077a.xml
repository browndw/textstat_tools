<s n="s3.7;p1.16">It contrasts from the Ricardian model of comparative advantage in that it introduces a second factor of production, namely capital, and that it assumes identical production technologies in both countries. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p1.16">There are two goods, two countries and two factors of production; hence the model is sometimes called the 2x2x2 model. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p1.16">The countries have different factor endowments and one good is intensive in the use of one factor while the other good uses the other factor intensively. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p1.16">Consequently, a country would have a comparative advantage in producing the good which uses intensively the factor in which the country is well endowed. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p1.16">For example, clothes are relatively labour intensive in production, and if a country were relatively well endowed in labour (say, India), they would have a comparative advantage in producing clothes. </s>

<s n="s1.10;p3.16">It is the last assumption that identifies the H-O model, and the other rigorous assumptions are put forward to eliminate the possibility that the comparative advantages can be based on other differences between the countries. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p3.16">Thus, the model can appropriately scrutinise comparative advantages and trade by focusing on international differences in relative factor endowments. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p3.16">We have assumed that India is relative labour-abundant and Japan is relatively capital-abundant (or labour-scarce). </s>
<s n="s4.10;p3.16">Moreover, we have assumed that electronics is relatively capital intensive in production and that clothes are relatively labour intensive. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p3.16">With different factor endowments and identical demand, relative factor prices in autarky<ref target="BAWE_0077a-ftnote.002"/> should reflect the countries' factor endowments. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p3.16">This would imply that Japan has relatively inexpensive capital (i.e. low interest rates) and India should have relatively cheap labour (i.e low wages).<ref target="BAWE_0077a-ftnote.003"/> Intuitively, in perfect competition the relative price of the goods must equal their relative costs. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p3.16">As the price of capital increases, the cost of producing electronics must increase proportionally more than the price of clothes. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p3.16">This implies that there is an inverse relationship between the relative price of electronics (the capital intensive good) and the wage-rental ratio (the relative factor price ratio). </s>
<s n="s9.10;p3.16">Additionally, the autarky price ratio<ref target="BAWE_0077a-ftnote.004"/> is higher in Japan than in India. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p6.16">The fact that the two countries have different endowments also affects their production possibility frontiers (PPFs). </s>

<s n="s3.5;p6.16">However, the shapes of the PPFs are also determined by the relative factor endowments as we can see from Graph 1 above. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p6.16">As Japan is relatively capital abundant, their production possibilities are skewed towards the good that is capital intensive in production, namely electronics, and vice versa for India. </s>

<s n="s1.8;p7.16">Before explaining the FPE theorem, it is worth explaining what happens if the countries open up to trade. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p7.16">The H-O theorem states that, given the assumptions of the model, a country will export the good that intensively uses its relatively abundant factor. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p7.16">Thus, in our case, Japan would export electronics and India would export clothes. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p7.16">This is shown in the diagram below (Graph 2). </s>
<s n="s5.8;p7.16">Initially we have that the autarky price ratio is higher in Japan than in India. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p7.16">Since clothes are relatively cheaper in India than in Japan, people in Japan will demand clothes from India and the producers of clothes in India will respond by increasing their supply of clothes. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p7.16">This causes the price ratio in India to fall, and vice versa in Japan. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p7.16">Therefore, the new equilibrium free trade price ratio must lie between the two autarky price ratios, where trade is balanced and where the marginal rate of transformation and the marginal rate of substitution in the two countries are equal to the free trade price ratio p*. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p10.16">As we can see from Graph 3, an increase in the price of clothes will lead to an increase in the production of clothes, and a decrease in the output of electronics. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p10.16">Along a ray from the origin, all isoquants have constant slope, so that the slope at point B is equal to the slope at point C. Since the demand for clothes increase, and clothes being labour intensive, the demand for labour increases proportionately more than the demand for capital. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p10.16">Thus it follows that the wage-rental ratio in B (k <hi rend="sub">2</hi>) is higher than in A (k <hi rend="sub">1</hi>), as a response of the excess demand for labour and excess supply of capital. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p10.16">Hence, an increase in the relative price of clothes will increase the relative return to the factor that is used intensively in the production of clothes (labour), i.e. increase wages. </s>

<s n="s2.2;p12.16">This is known as the Factor Price Equalisation (FPE) theorem, and it states that, under the given assumptions and in particular with no complete specialisation, free trade in commodities will equalise relative and absolute factor prices through the equalisation of relative commodity prices, and thus ensure world Pareto efficiency (illustrated in graph 4 below). </s>
