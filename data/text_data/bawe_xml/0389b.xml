<s n="s1.4;p1.21">The role of process research and development department at AstraZeneca is to discover and develop robust, economic manufacturing processes for new chemical entities. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p1.21">The team also provides supplies of drug substances to fund development programmes and to provide chemical manufacturing controls documentation to satisfy external regulatory authorities. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p1.21">The equipment used in the scale up lab/plant is not that dissimilar to the type of vessel used in a discovery lab. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p1.21">However to describe process chemistry as bucket chemistry would be incorrect and to assume that it just involves scaling up existing process would also be an incorrect description. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.21">
<s n="s1.8;p2.21">The department is divided into five parts; process chemistry; process analysis; development manufacture (pilot plant and large scale lab); process engineering; and projects management. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p2.21">Each of these plays a key role during the chemical development of a new chemical entity and each of these areas employs chemists. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p2.21">The process chemistry area devises the final route of manufacture and optimises the chosen route into a viable manufacturing process. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p2.21">Process analysts develop appropriate analytical methodology to assess the purity of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and the intermediates, specifications are set along the process chemists of intermediates and APIs, a methodology is developed to monitor reactions to help gain the maximum amount of information. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p2.21">Development manufacture are responsible for running the process in the pilot plant or kilo-lab, they work closely with process chemistry to ensure that the process being developed is compatible with the intended site of manufacture. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p2.21">Process engineering help with plant suitability and compatibility, help decide between isolation options for example crystallisation, resolution of specific scale up issues for example agitation and heat/mass transfer, and make sure engineering problems are not solved using chemistry. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p2.21">Project management is the link between the global project teams and process research and development; they coordinate pan-process research and development activities at a high level. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p2.21">The interface between process research and development and other departments for a particular project is overseen by project management along with various outsourcing activities. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.21">
<s n="s1.15;p3.21">Process research and development is a diverse area, there are many interactions with other departments in order to aid the overall production of a successful drug. </s>
<s n="s2.15;p3.21">These departments include discovery, regulatory, formulation, drug metabolism, manufacturing, safety assessment, patent and marketing. </s>
<s n="s3.15;p3.21">The process of producing a new drug is a lengthy and difficult process, from the point of lead identification if can take up to 3 years for the drug discovery team to develop a candidate for selection. </s>
<s n="s4.15;p3.21">The next stage is drug development, which is where process research and development fits in this can take up to 5 years. </s>
<s n="s5.15;p3.21">There are three phases within this, phase I is initial safety and clinical trials, phase II is clinical trials in patients and phase III is wide ranging trials for comparative efficiency and safety prior to marketing. </s>
<s n="s6.15;p3.21">When all this is completed the drug is marketed and launched. </s>
<s n="s7.15;p3.21">The whole process can take in the region of 15 years to complete<ref target="BAWE_0389b-endnote.001"/>. </s>
<s n="s8.15;p3.21">Each phase of drug development requires a differing quantity of the selected drug candidate and it is the job of process research and development to produce a route which is viable to synthesise the drug on these scales; phase I requires 5-10kg, phase II 30-100kg and phase III 100-500kg. </s>
<s n="s9.15;p3.21">Discovery support work alongside process research and development to reduce the time it takes to identify the final route, there are two ways to do this; scale up the discovery route (which generally is not the best way to approach this) or to improve the way in which the best route is selected by starting earlier. </s>
<s n="s10.15;p3.21">It is key for discovery and process to collaborate - it is this collaboration which speeds up the very lengthy process of discovery and development. </s>
<s n="s11.15;p3.21">The supply of the first 1-5kg is often a variant of the discovery route, however once 5kg has been produced the next step requires 30kg. </s>
<s n="s12.15;p3.21">Generally the discovery route is not viable for this larger scale production so in parallel to manufacturing the initial 5kg there needs to be development of an alternative route or the discovery route needs to be dropped all together in order to take the route all the way through the three phases. </s>
<s n="s13.15;p3.21">Statistics show that only an average of 18% of drug candidates survive from clinical phase 1 to registration <hi rend="sup">4</hi>. </s>
<s n="s14.15;p3.21">This means that the optimisation of a chemical process maybe wasted though this risk has to be accepted as generally the alternative processes in many cases deliver the required quantities faster and at much lower prices. </s>
<s n="s15.15;p3.21">The venture to early optimisation can often pay off later on. </s>

<p n="p5.21">
<s n="s1.4;p5.21">Even the most simple discovery routes can have issues making scale up difficult, an example of this is the synthesis of benzthiophene. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p5.21">The initial medicinal chemistry route is shown in figure 1, the starting material used (2-bromothiophenol) is very expensive and not readily available. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p5.21">This could be made in-house but that would mean going backwards and making the route longer which is not desirable, the solution would be to change the route. </s>

<head rend="bold">Figure 2: Initial route to the synthesis of idoxifene</head>

<p n="p7.21">
<s n="s1.3;p7.21">The solution to this is to use the 1,4-diiodobenzene compound to form the intermediate (figure 3), the addition of butyl lithium could be around 10 hours without affecting the yield or quality and changing the solvent allowed the reaction to be carried out at much higher temperatures. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p7.21">There are many factors to consider when deciding on the most viable route. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p7.21">Normally the best route is the cheapest but there are other things to take in account such as safety, health and environment, patents (need to make sure no other patents are infringed), regulatory and operability factors<ref target="BAWE_0389b-endnote.004"/>. </s>

<s n="s2.4;p8.21">In the future there will be an increased pressure to get a drug to market and it is hard to move quickly with this when the route is inefficient, there is also patent pressure as they only last 20 years. </s>

<s n="s3.3;p10.21">There were two problems encountered with this synthesis; firstly the starting material is a viscous liquid and therefore was difficult to handle especially on a large scale; secondly route 1 is not cis selective through tosylation and so route 2 is the preferred route to form intermediate <hi rend="bold">7</hi>. </s>
