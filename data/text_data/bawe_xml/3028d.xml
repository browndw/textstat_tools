<head>What is a Genus?</head>
<p n="p10.53">
<s n="s1.2;p10.53">There is currently great debate among systematists over the definition of genus category as part of a wider discussion about the taxonomic implications of recent developments in phylogenetic analysis (Wood &amp; Collard 1999). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p10.53">I want to illustrate the two main interpretations of the category genus being debated. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p11.53">
<s n="s1.4;p11.53">The first being that of the <hi rend="bold">evolutionary systematic</hi>, species belonging to a particular genus sharing a common ancestry and occupying a similar adaptive zone or ecological situation different to that of related genera (Mayr 1950). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p11.53">Under this definition the genus can either be <hi rend="bold">monophyletic</hi> or <hi rend="bold">paraphyletic</hi>. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p11.53">Species can still have common ancestry, yet it is not necessary that they share a common ancestor within the ontological time spanned by the species of the genus. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p11.53">They must just share an inter-related adaptive zone. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p12.53">
<s n="s1.2;p12.53">The second definition demands species within a genus be more closely related to each other, than to that of other species assigned to related genera. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p12.53">Under the <hi rend="bold">cladistic</hi> definition the species of the genus can only be <hi rend="bold">monophyletic</hi>. </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.53">
<s n="s1.10;p13.53">Advocates of the cladistic system reject that of the evolutionary systematic due to their belief that paraphyletic taxa are not real evolutionary units. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p13.53">Yet, on the other hand problems persist for those who classify taxa in virtue of their monophyletic basis, in that; there is no criterion for specifying how many species should be included in the genus. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p13.53">Evolution is a gradual process over grand periods of time, evolution by punctuated equilibrium is theoretically problematic (Dawkins 1989, 1999; Dennett 1996). </s>
<s n="s4.10;p13.53">So, where do you define lower limits? </s>
<s n="s5.10;p13.53">Which are the terminal species? </s>
<s n="s6.10;p13.53">In the gradual sense of adaptationism a terminal species within a monophylum would share an adaptive strategy with directly related taxa contained within an ancestrally related juxtaposed genus; units in gradual evolution on a monophyletic line. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p13.53">Can this possibly be overcome by recognising the terminal species as an evolutionary coherent unit and classifying it as a monotypic genus? </s>
<s n="s8.10;p13.53">In addition, determination and removal of paraphyletic taxa is particularly problematic when dealing with such forces as convergent evolution. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p13.53">One pragmatic solution from Wood and Collard (1999: 66) is to carefully revise and redefine a genus category in gradistic terms of the first interpretation above, so that paraphyletic taxa are inadmissible. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p13.53">Yet, such as strategy is not an easy task when applying it to taxa of the fossil record. </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.53">
<s n="s1.2;p14.53">Although to highlight difficulties as illustrated above, that adaptationism in its gradual evolutionary sense is problematic in the classification of monophyletic taxa. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p14.53">I still concur with Wood &amp; Collard that: </s>
</p>
<quote lang="English">...a genus should be defined as a species, or monophylum, whose members occupy a single adaptive zone (1999: 66). </quote>
<p n="p15.53">
<s n="s1.5;p15.53">Therefore, we have determined cladistics as the method of choice for identifying monophyletic groups. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p15.53">Yet, we still require an equivocal system for identifying adaptive strategies, or zones as stated by Wood &amp; Collard above. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p15.53">A definition of a genus category that does not permit the entry of paraphyletic taxa; a strategy unique to the monophyletic genus. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p15.53">Wood &amp; Collard (1999:66) combat this by stating that taxonomic units contained within the Homo genus should, by monophyletic definition, be more related to <hi rend="italic">H.sapiens</hi> than to other related genera such as the <hi rend="italic">Australopithicines</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Paranthropines</hi>. </s>

<head>Historical Context; Leakey Debate</head>
<p n="p16.53">
<s n="s1.4;p16.53">Olduvai Gorge in Kenya National Park has been the site of many convention redefining finds of early hominin fossil remains. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p16.53">The first discoveries of prospective Homo remains were found not long after Mary Leakey found 'Zinj' <hi rend="italic">(Zinjanthropus Boisei)</hi>, now known as <hi rend="italic">A.boisei,</hi> in 1960. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p16.53">Mode 1 tooling had previously been found in the area dating to around 2.6-2.3mya (Semaw et.al 1997), yet were only tentatively being connected to 'Zinj', being of small cranial vault size dated to 1.75mya via the first application of radiometric dating (argon/potassium) in anthropology (Leakeyal. 1961). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p16.53">Between 1960 and 1963, in a period of pressure and interest in the public eye to uncover more about out earliest ancestors, Louis Leakey who had been working in the area since the 1930s made a series of discoveries. </s>
</p>
<p n="p17.53">
<s n="s1.6;p17.53">The fossil remains known as OH 7, found by Louis Leakey in 1960, were the dawn of a new era in the debate of <hi rend="italic">Homo</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p17.53">With an increased cranial vault size of 640cc, compared to that of 513cc of <hi rend="italic">A.boisei</hi>, Leakey quickly made the connection between the remains of OH7 and the Mode 1 stone tooling found in the area. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p17.53">Leakey was determined to press <hi rend="italic">H.habilis</hi> (OH7), as a member of the <hi rend="italic">Homo</hi> genus, even though it did not fit the requirements of <hi rend="italic">Homo</hi> classification. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p17.53">Named 'habilis on Raymond Dart's recommendation (Lewin &amp; Foley 2004). </s>
<s n="s5.6;p17.53">Therefore, acting accordingly, Leakey (1964:7) in his 1964 paper redefined the criteria of the <hi rend="italic">Homo</hi> genus to ensure entry of <hi rend="italic">H.habilis.</hi> </s>
<s n="s6.6;p17.53">This caused a great deal of uproar, as it broke convention and it did not fit with contemporary thinking of <hi rend="italic">Homo</hi>. </s>

<div1 type="section">
<head>Criteria for Entry into <hi rend="italic">Homo</hi>
</head>
<p n="p18.53">
<s n="s1.2;p18.53">In the late 1940's Sir Author Keith proposed a figure of 750cc for the bottom limit of Homo, that being a calculated mid-point between the largest known gorilla brain and the smallest human brain. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p18.53">This was one of four main criteria for entry in the Homo genus, and by 1964 this proposal was widely accepted. </s>
</p>
<p n="p19.53">
<s n="s1.4;p19.53">As previously mentioned, OH7's estimated cranium capacity was 640cc, yet not being fully mature it was estimated at adulthood it would have reached a full capacity of 673cc. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p19.53">Although, still too small to be accepted by the general consensus of requirement for entry of <hi rend="italic">Homo</hi> at the time. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p19.53">This did not deter Leakey, who continued to insist the reliability of his argument which included that of one of cultural traits, in that OH-7 was the logically deductive candidate for the maker and user of the Mode 1 tools that had been found in Olduvai Gorge. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p19.53">This being the first time the use of an argument of cultural traits had been utilized to explain reasoning in the fossil record (Lewin &amp; Foley 2004), and caused much wide spread disagreement. </s>
</p>
<p n="p20.53">
<s n="s1.2;p20.53">However, due to other fossil findings that fitted with <hi rend="italic">H.habilis</hi>, (<hi rend="italic">see Fossils table at beginning of next section</hi>), and Leakey's continued pressure on the scientific community <hi rend="italic">H.habilis</hi> and the revision of the original 4 criteria for membership of <hi rend="italic">Homo</hi> have become more or less accepted. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p20.53">Yet, further debate still persists and will be a continued theme of this essay. </s>
</p>
<p n="p21.53">
<s n="s1.1;p21.53">Without taking any formal definitions into account, taking Leakey's (1964:7) revisions into account, in practise fossil hominin species are assigned to <hi rend="italic">Homo</hi> in satisfying at least one of four of the following criteria (Leakey, Tobias &amp; Napier 1964; Tobias 1991): </s>
</p>
<list type="bulleted">
<item>An absolute brain size of 600cc.</item>
<item>The possession of language, as is theoretically possible to infer from endocranial casts.</item>
<item>The possession of a modern humanlike precision grip involving a well developed and opposable pollex.</item>
<item>The ability to manufacture stone tools. </item>
</list>
<p n="p22.53">
<s n="s1.9;p22.53">Yet, these criteria are anything but fixed convention for membership of <hi rend="italic">Homo</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p22.53">It is recently been proposed (e.g. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p22.53">Wood &amp; Collard 1999, Boyd &amp; Silk 2002) than none of these criteria are now satisfactory, as it is not certain whether the criteria accurately represent features essential to membership of <hi rend="italic">Homo</hi>, or unique to the <hi rend="italic">Homo</hi> genus. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p22.53">Doubts and areas for further debate in the course of this essay are as follows; As Martin (1983) suggests, the Cerebral Rubicon is now problematic due to the doubt of absolute cranial capacity being of biological significance. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p22.53">In relevance to the second point of criteria, there is substantial doubt that the language function cannot reliably be inferred from the structure of Endocasts BROCA's AREA, neither are language related parts of the brain as well localised as previous studies implied (Galaburda &amp; Pandya 1982; Gannon et.al 1998). </s>
<s n="s6.9;p22.53">Functional morphological analyses of the hands of the early hominins have indicated that either a precision grip should not only be restricted to the genus of <hi rend="italic">Homo</hi>, as there is evidence for its functional use amongst the <hi rend="italic">Australopithecus</hi> genus whose behaviour and diet is likely to be radically different to that of <hi rend="italic">Homo</hi> according to other related morphological data. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p22.53">Or, that it cannot be assured of the possession of the precision grip amongst any of the early hominins (Susman 1994; 1998). </s>
<s n="s8.9;p22.53">With respect to the fourth criterion Semaw (1997) has suggested that the connection between <hi rend="italic">Homo</hi> and stone tool manufacture, which come from deposits 2.6-2.3 million years old, were almost certainly contemporaneous with both early <hi rend="italic">Homo</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Australopithecus</hi> genera. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p22.53">It is even difficult to find at present a likely candidate amongst the Homo fossil remains as stone tooling appears to precede them. </s>
</p>
<p n="p23.53">
<s n="s1.7;p23.53">The above criticisms are anything but final and will be further discussed in the essay. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p23.53">Yet, Wood &amp; Collard (1999), as discussed in a previous section prefer to adopt an alternative cladistic strategy of trying to identify an adaptive strategy unique to the genus, in the attempt to eliminate paraphyletic taxa. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p23.53">Yet, in that attempt they are forced to identify criteria of that adaptive zone. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p23.53">It is hard to dismiss criteria such as use of Mode 1 tooling requiring sophisticated cognitive architecture as not being an integral part of what is to be part of the Homo genus, or integral to the adaptive zone or strategy of the genus. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p23.53">There must be criteria, grey areas to exist with respect to terminal species in a gradual (not punctuated) monophyletic evolutionary line. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p23.53">Therefore, we shall continue with Wood &amp; Collard's (1999) notion that of a genus should be a monophylum, yet will offer flexibility with respect to criteria in what constitutes an adaptive strategy. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p23.53">Classification of a gradual process is problematic, better to view many criteria instead of few and abduct a decision among convention. </s>
