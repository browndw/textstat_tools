<s n="s2.12;p6.32">(Jafferyal. 1989) It was first introduced in 1956 and used extensively throughout the world on a large number of agricultural and horticultural crops for the control of pest such as aphids, spider mite and pea midge, etc. </s>

<s n="s4.12;p6.32">In addition, Dimethoate is also used as a residual wall spray in farm buildings for house flies. </s>
<s n="s5.12;p6.32">The action spectrum of organophosphate is very broad, it acts on wide range of organisms; animals, plants and insect. </s>
<s n="s6.12;p6.32">(Jafferyal. 1989). </s>
<s n="s7.12;p6.32">The chemical and physical properties of Dimethoate together with its effectiveness contribute to the increasingly preference over the organochlorine pesticides (e.g.: DDT) during the 1960s. </s>
<s n="s8.12;p6.32">Dimethoate is moderately soluble in water and highly soluble in most organic solvents. </s>
<s n="s9.12;p6.32">It is fairly stable in water and acid solution, but relatively unstable in alkaline solution. </s>
<s n="s10.12;p6.32">Dimethoate is often applied as fumigant. </s>
<s n="s11.12;p6.32">Actions of Dimethoate can be contact and/ or systemic, such systemic action can compensate for the poor initial coverage. </s>
<s n="s12.12;p6.32">It is particularly effective to aphids and other insects that suck a poisoned sap; therefore, it could be quite safe for other insect to walk on the Dimethoate contaminated plant. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.32">
<s n="s1.14;p7.32">Once Dimethoate absorbed following ingestion, inhalation or skin contact, it is highly toxic. </s>
<s n="s2.14;p7.32">(Al-Jaghbiral. 1992). </s>
<s n="s3.14;p7.32">Dimethoate functions by interfering the activities of Acetylcholine esterase, which is critical for the proper functioning of nervous systems of both humans and insects (Hassal 1990; Lopez-Carillo and Lopez-Cervantes 1993). </s>
<s n="s4.14;p7.32">Dimethoate is very potent once it is inside the body and it undergoes active phosphorylation with the enzyme acetyl cholinesterase (AchE). </s>
<s n="s5.14;p7.32">This cause AchE inhibition and the build up of neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. </s>

<s n="s9.14;p7.32">Such physiological and psychological effects alter the locomotory (Jensen et al., 1997) and foraging behaviors (Dempster, 1968) of insects. </s>
<s n="s10.14;p7.32">Furthermore, a variety of studies suggested that Dimethoate is canerogenic and mutagenic. </s>
<s n="s11.14;p7.32">(Tripathy et al.) </s>
<s n="s12.14;p7.32">Dimethoate is biodegradable, constantly breaking down via hydrolysis. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p8.32">Aphid is a generalist pest, forming colonies on many crops. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p8.32">Aphid feed on plant material and produce a sweet, sticky extract called honeydew which a black fungus called sooty mould sometimes colonized on. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p8.32">A serious infection on leaves will lower the rate of photosynthetic rate; this dramatically reduces the crop yield. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p8.32">(Ekesi et al.) </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.32">
<s n="s1.8;p9.32">Ground beetles form one of the biggest groups within carabid species; they are very abundant in arable habitats in the United Kingdom. </s>

<s n="s3.8;p9.32">(Luff, 1974; Dixon &amp; McKinlay, 1992) Therefore, certain carabid beetles species are considered to be important biological control agents for aphid pests in arable habitats. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p9.32">(Kromp, 1999; Symondson et al., 2002) Several lines of evidence of cereal aphid dislodgment from plants due to physical and biological factors have been recorded. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p9.32">The chance of aphid decolonization was shown to much lower in areas that own a high ground beetle density. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p9.32">(Winder, 1990).It is suggested that the phenomenon is due to the predation of aphids by ground beetles. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p9.32">Although ground beetles constantly control aphid's population by acting as natural enemies, it is often not powerful enough to reduce the aphid's population below the economic damage threshold. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p9.32">Pesticides are often used to prevent the reduction in yield and the spread of Barley Yellow Dwarf viruses. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.32">
<s n="s1.7;p10.32">Pterostichus madidus is one of the most common ground beetles occur in the United Kingdom, usually found under stones or logs in daytime; often in gardens. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p10.32">It is predatory, but also feeds on plant materials, including fruits. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p10.32">It is well known predator of insect pest such as aphids and slugs and it particularly plays an important role in controlling aphid's population.( Mair, 2002; Luff, 1974; Dixon &amp; McKinlay,1992 ) </s>
<s n="s4.7;p10.32">The systemic action of Dimethoate kills off aphids colonies in a very fast rate. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p10.32">Although the action of Dimethoate is mainly systemic, it is frequently apply as fumigant and statistics of direct contact effect on non-target organisms are worrying. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p10.32">There is increasing evidence that application of organophosphate insecticide reduces carabid beetle activity density and altered community composition in the crop area. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p10.32">(Hassan et al., 1991, 1994) The aim of this study is to investigate the direct effect of Dimethoate to Pterostichus madidus in different concentration. </s>
