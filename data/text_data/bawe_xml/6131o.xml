<s n="s4.20;p8.18">1996). </s>
<s n="s5.20;p8.18">It is important to select the plots according to the vegetation or habitat characteristics to avoid edge effects so that in the gravel pits case, species with complex patterns in nesting and feeding habitats may decrease the precision on the data. </s>
<s n="s6.20;p8.18">The visits need to be several times throughout the suitable seasons. </s>
<s n="s7.20;p8.18">This method is the most applicable for singing birds with territoriality and the observation during the breeding seasons which there are often clear territories for each species (Bibby,. </s>

<s n="s10.11;p10.18">Distinguishable birds are appropriate in this technique, however, it is not suitable for the species that are easily disturbed by the surroundings and the distance from the observer and the difference in song patterns also affect on the probability of the detection of individual birds, resulting in the higher occurrence of nearer, characteristic birds than further, less detectable ones (Sutherland. </s>

<s n="s2.13;p12.18">Due to constrain that this method is time-consuming, the balance with the budget on the project needs to be well organised, Although there are some strengths and weaknesses compared to other techniques as described, as a whole, it is very useful to compare species abundance, population and distribution patterns in a characteristic area like the gravel pit (BTO, 2005. </s>

<s n="s7.13;p12.18">In addition, there are well established data over a long period of time available for comparison. </s>
<s n="s8.13;p12.18">Taking account the seasonal variation in species, early April to the end of July is the best time for breeding species in summer and from late November to the end of February for wintering birds, and visit hours should also be clearly planned (Bibby,. </s>

<s n="s3.17;p13.18">Photography, if possible, may be helpful and reduce the hour of field work. </s>
<s n="s4.17;p13.18">The greater care in carrying out the census is required in this case, for example, Sand Martin (<hi rend="italic">Ripariaq riparia</hi>) which is likely to form arrogated colonies on the slope of sand cliff, can mislead the population estimate due to the failure in plot allocations (BTO, 2005. </s>

<s n="s11.17;p13.18">
<hi rend="italic">et al</hi>. </s>
<s n="s12.17;p13.18">1996). </s>
<s n="s13.17;p13.18">Alternatively, the survey during the intense territorial activity from October to December is also recommended. </s>
<s n="s14.17;p13.18">Since this species is the territorial male, the identification of territory boundaries between individual males together with the record of clusters can also be done (Bibby,. </s>
