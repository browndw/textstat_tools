</p>
<p n="p91.108">
<s n="s1.6;p91.108">At a glance it can be seen that when using the lower power fans a lower payback time is achieved. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p91.108">This is obvious from the 'best designs' chart in appendix 20 , where all but one of the designs utilise the 6 pole 83GW fan, which of all the fans analysed requires the lowest power. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p91.108">Also note that all the fans shown in appendix 20 are 6pole fans. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p91.108">The capital and running costs of the lesser pole fans proved too high for this particular heat exchanger design. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p91.108">The power requirements and initial price of the larger fans are not realistic for the type of heat exchanger in question, however may be more reliable and so provide more long-term benefits. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p91.108">Due to the lack of information on this aspect, further analysis and discussion is impossible. </s>
</p>
<p n="p92.108">
<s n="s1.4;p92.108">The larger fans allow for a larger, more effective heat exchanger. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p92.108">This is visible in the data tables and illustrated in appendix 21. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p92.108">However this increase in effectiveness does not compensate for the capital, and annual costs of the larger fans. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p93.108">When the best results from each fin design are compared, this is illustrated in appendix 20, it can be seen that the louvered fins provide the best payback times. </s>

<s n="s3.7;p93.108">The louvered designs provided a larger surface area and also increase the turbulence of the passing air, giving greatly improved heat transfer. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p93.108">Detailed analysis of why louvered fins improve performance is given in appendix 22. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p93.108">Comparisons between louvered fins and various other fins are shown in appendix 26. </s>
