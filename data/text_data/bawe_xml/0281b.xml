<s n="s1.6;p1.54">This essay argues that the implementation of Structural Adjustment Programmes, such as trade liberalisation, inflation control and fiscal deficit reduction, had a direct influence on the rise of the Brazilian Movement of Landless Rural Workers in the 1990s. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p1.54">These policies did not take into account the country's reality and the result was an increase in poverty and inequality, creating a contingent of rural unemployed people. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p1.54">The peasants could not be incorporated into the urban workforce for two main reasons: lack of formal education and lack of jobs, since the cities were also suffering the consequences of the SAPs. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p1.54">The MST seized the opportunity and recruited almost 70,000 landless families, enlarging by 466.36 percent in a decade. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p1.54">This rise was marked by intensification of land occupations and radicalisation of rural conflicts. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p1.54">Public demonstrations for agrarian reform led the World Bank, who imposed the SAPs in the first place, to release US$ 90 million to fund purchase of land and settlements. </s>
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">1- Introduction</head>
<p n="p2.54">
<s n="s1.1;p2.54">In this essay we argue that the Structural Adjustment Programmes (SAPs) introduced in Brazil by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank had direct influence on the rise of the Brazilian Movement of Landless Rural Workers (Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra, MST) in the 1990s. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.54">
<s n="s1.3;p3.54">Between 1989 and 1999, the government took US$ 8.5 billion in loans from the IMF. In exchange, the country had to adopt neo-liberal policies such as trade liberalisation, privatisation, inflation control and public deficit reduction. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p3.54">Both rural and urban areas were affected by these changes. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p3.54">We will focus on the impact of these policies on the rural areas only; during that decade the landless movement grew by 466.36%. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.54">
<s n="s1.5;p4.54">We begin by introducing the concept of SAPs and its implementation by the IMF and the World Bank in developing countries. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p4.54">Next we present the MST in historical perspective, looking into its grassroots' origins. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p4.54">In the third part, we assess of the influence of SAPs on the growth of the MST in the 1990s. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p4.54">We conclude by claiming that the implementation of SAPs without considering the Brazilian realities penalised the rural poor. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p4.54">The increase in poverty and inequality in the countryside and the rise of land concentration provided fertile ground for the development of the MST, whose success is related both to its fight for access to land and to its opposition to the neo-liberal order. </s>
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">2- Structural Adjustment Programmes</head>
<p n="p5.54">
<s n="s1.3;p5.54">The World Bank introduced Structural Adjustment Programmes as part of the loans package in 1980. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p5.54">The International Monetary Fund adopted the same procedure in 1986. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p5.54">To understand the reasons behind the adoption of conditionality for loans to developing countries, we must look back to the 1970s and understand the roles played by the two institutions within the international economic order. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.54">
<s n="s1.5;p6.54">The World Bank and the IMF were created in the end of the Second World War in the context of the Bretton Woods' agreements, in 1944. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p6.54">While the World Bank's objective was to provide financial resources for countries devastated by the war, the IMF's aim was to assure stability of exchange rates and to make the necessary adjustments to keep this order. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p6.54">Countries running short of foreign exchange could get short-term help from the Fund as far as they agreed to implement certain policies. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p6.54">Underdeveloped countries had been trying to obtain more resources from the Fund and the World Bank since the 1950s, but the majority found the condi-tionality to access credit too harsh. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p6.54">In fact, the IMF used these requirements in order to rationalise money: countries could not blame the Fund for lack of support if they were not willing to follow its rules (Zack-Williams, Brown and Mohan 2000, 15). </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.54">
<s n="s1.8;p7.54">By the late 1970s, underdeveloped countries were attracted by commercial bank's credit. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p7.54">These banks were full of petro-dollars and would not require the Bretton Woods institutions' conditionalities to give loans. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p7.54">In the late 1980s, the developing states' indebtedness was increasing; they had not undertaken the required adjustments. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p7.54">Moreover, these countries were not prepared to deal with the new reality of international economy, which was not based just on trade, but on capital flows as well. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p7.54">New and complex investment products, such as derivatives, were placed in the financial market. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p7.54">Countries were not able to control their currencies through currency market intervention anymore. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p7.54">They should attract investment through economic fundamentals. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p7.54">The inspiration for these fundamentals would come from the neo-classical paradigm, championed by the United States. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.54">
<s n="s1.2;p8.54">Underdeveloped economies willing to receive assistance from the IMF and the World Bank would have to adopt the SAPs, which according to Woodward (1992, quoted in Milward 2000, 25), were 'designed to enable the adjusting country to change the structure of its economy in order to meet its long-term needs of efficient utilisation of factors of production to ensure sustained growth'. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p8.54">In the Milward's words, SAP refers 'to the process whereby the economies of the Third World are being reshaped to be more market oriented' (2000, 25). </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.54">
<s n="s1.4;p9.54">Hence, from 1986 a country that was eligible for the IMF help was required to prepare a three-year adjustment programme set out in a policy framework paper. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p9.54">The SAP would also depend on the amount of the credit in negotiation. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p9.54">In the case of the World Bank, a SAP could involve just a specific sector, such as health. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p9.54">The World Bank had to be part of the agreement if a loan was to be approved to low-income countries. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.54">
<s n="s1.4;p10.54">Under the neo-classical paradigm, the structural adjustment policies are mainly based on three points: macroeconomic stabilization, privatisation and liberalisation. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p10.54">As to macroeconomic stability, tight budget is necessary to bring inflation down to a single digit level and further, to a figure of around 3-4 percent. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p10.54">Privatisation also helps inflation reduction as it eliminates subsidies for public sector and improves efficiency; these policies lead to a decrease of the fiscal deficit as well. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p10.54">Finally, the liberalisation policy asserts that the state should free prices, reduce regulation and subsidies, free labour markets, and reduce trade barriers (Milward 2000, 33; Cheru and Gill 1997, 157). </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.54">
<s n="s1.1;p11.54">The role of the state is to provide an economic environment within which markets can operate, but it should also be concentrated in the promotion of human capital formation through universalisation of literacy, extension of technical education and access to safe drinking water and health facilities by all (Dasgupta 1998, 95). </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.54">
<s n="s1.6;p12.54">One of the criticisms to the neo-classical model is that the assumptions mentioned above do not consider the realities of the countries in which it is implemented. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p12.54">An example is the idea that free trade is the perfect model to achieve full employment of all actors of production. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p12.54">For Milward (2000, 36), this is unrealistic in less developed economies. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p12.54">States do not have equal influence in their trade with each other. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p12.54">In fact, there is an unequal exchange between the primary products from developing countries and the products of advanced economies. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p12.54">'The outcome is that free trade produces an increasing gap between the national income of the poor and rich nations.' </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.54">
<s n="s1.3;p13.54">Another criticism of SAPs refers to the loss of autonomy of countries in the politics of policy formulation. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p13.54">Despite the fact that 'IMF intervention is routinely at request of governmental authorities', therefore it cannot be interpreted as a threat to sovereignty (Held 1989, 196, quoted in Mohan 2000, 80), critics claim that structural adjustment programmes have been applied in a doctrinaire and coercive way which leaves little room for manoeuvre. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p13.54">As these policies are implemented in economies with preceding years of hyperinflation and economic hardship, sometimes even the opposition parties within the country resign themselves to the inevitability of the adjustment. </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.54">
<s n="s1.6;p14.54">However, this does not mean that there is no internal resistance to the SAPs. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p14.54">Latin American countries, for example, have experienced strong opposition to the political neo-liberal policies imposed by the IMF and the World Bank. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p14.54">As a result, political populism, thought to be dead in the 1980s, has been rearing its ugly head again in the region (Mohan 2000, 84). </s>
<s n="s4.6;p14.54">In the past, 'populism was depicted as the very antithesis of the new neo-liberal order through its association with irresponsible state spending and corrupt state-led economic strategies'. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p14.54">The new populism, by contrast, is referred to as a lower-class backlash against austerity, inequalities and market insecurities attendant on neo-liberalism (Roberts 1995, 83, quoted in Mohan 2000, 85). </s>
<s n="s6.6;p14.54">The analysis of recent electoral results in the region - Bolivia and Venezuela for instance - provide evidence of the re-emergence of this phenomenon. </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.54">
<s n="s1.3;p15.54">In countries where political opposition has not been strong, resistance may come from social movements and non-governmental organisations (NGOs). </s>
<s n="s2.3;p15.54">In fact, Brown (2000, 171) reported an increase in the number of civil society associations all around the world created to challenge the neo-liberal consensus. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p15.54">That is the case of the movement of landless workers in Brazil. </s>

<p n="p16.54">
<s n="s1.7;p16.54">The MST is the first national agrarian movement in Brazil. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p16.54">Its grassroots can be traced to the country's history. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p16.54">When the Portuguese crown claimed the land in 1500, it was decided that the territory would be divided into 12 giant provinces, called <hi rend="italic">capitanias</hi>, which were given as gifts to royal friends and relatives. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p16.54">These people were allowed to exploit the areas to their own benefit despite the fact that they did not own the provinces. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p16.54">For over 350 years, slaves brought from Africa were forced to work in sugar fields, goldmines and coffee plantations. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p16.54">During this period, many slaves tried to escape and were killed or recaptured. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p16.54">But some were successful, such as the group that created in 1630 a community called Quilombo dos Palmares in the state of Pernambuco, whose leader, Zumbi, is an MST icon. </s>
</p>
<p n="p17.54">
<s n="s1.4;p17.54">The slavery was abolished in 1888 and a republican government was established one year later. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p17.54">Landowners, suddenly deprived of workforce, lobbied for state intervention. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p17.54">The government promptly responded, prohibiting land invasion and granting property rights to the <hi rend="italic">capitanias</hi>' heirs. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p17.54">The concentration of land had become official and the only alternative to former slaves was to accept low wages. </s>
</p>
<p n="p18.54">
<s n="s1.4;p18.54">In 1893, an itinerant preacher called Antonio Conselheiro started to attract followers with a discourse against the new Republican government, high taxes and the elites. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p18.54">He founded the village of Canudos in the north of the state of Bahia (northeast), where 20,000 people (mainly former slaves) lived and worked together in a big self-sufficient community. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p18.54">The central government accused the group of defending the return of the monarchy and sent four military expeditions to fight Canudos. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p18.54">In 1897, the army executed all the men in the village. </s>
</p>
<p n="p19.54">
<s n="s1.3;p19.54">Another important popular rebellion took place in the South of Brazil, in the state of Santa Catarina. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p19.54">Peasant families revolted against the government decision of granting a British railway company the ownership of 100 kilometres of land that was already occupied by them. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p19.54">The so-called war of Contestado raged from 1912 to 1916 and was won by the official forces, resulting in many deaths. </s>
</p>
<p n="p20.54">
<s n="s1.4;p20.54">The MST claims to be inspired by all these popular rebellions and a few others. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p20.54">In fact, it was in the same Southern region that the movement emerged, during the dictatorship period (1964-1985), with the Catholic Church support through the Pastoral Land Commission (CPT), which was created in 1975 to intervene and prevent violent land conflicts. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p20.54">Helped by priests, who allowed the landless leaders to meet in the church's premises when this kind of association was forbidden, the MST planned its first occupation in Encruzilhada Natalino, in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, in 1979 (Martins 2003, 1). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p20.54">The movement was formally created in 1984. </s>
</p>
<p n="p21.54">
<s n="s1.4;p21.54">In 1985, when Brazil was witnessing many public demonstrations for democratisation, the MST seized the opportunity and organised its first national assembly. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p21.54">During the meeting, the movement decided that the only solution for the agrarian problem was the occupation of unproductive land. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p21.54">The MST also established its 'model of social appropriation'. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p21.54">This model, based on cooperative relations among direct workers and alternative patterns of land appropriation and use, would be applied in settlements of members of the group. </s>
</p>
<p n="p22.54">
<s n="s1.6;p22.54">With the re-democratisation in 1985, the new government approved the national plan for agrarian reform (PRNA) whose aim was to give land to 1.4 million families. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p22.54">Under landowners' pressures, this plan had to be redrafted twelve times before an agreement was reached. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p22.54">The PRNA was reinforced later by the new Constitution, which established that all land not used for its social function - production - should be expropriated by the state and used for agrarian reform. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p22.54">The document specified that unproductive properties are those classified as not achieving 80% of the use of tillable land whose yields are bellow 100% of the average per hectare productive rates. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p22.54">The expropriation process includes long-term payment of compensation through bonds for the value of the land and cash payment for improvements (Sauer 2003, 1-2). </s>
<s n="s6.6;p22.54">This bill was not peacefully accepted. </s>
</p>
<p n="p23.54">
<s n="s1.3;p23.54">In the period between 1985 and 1988, when the new Constitution was being drafted in the Parliament, an organisation of strong opposition to the MST was created. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p23.54">The Ruralist Democratic Union (Uniao Democratica Ruralista, UDR) recruited 200,000 farm proprietors with the aim of joining forces and gathering private armies to fight MST invasions. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p23.54">Their defence was also in the Constitution: the private property right (Wright and Wolford 2003, 105). </s>
</p>
<p n="p24.54">
<s n="s1.5;p24.54">The scenario for conflict was formed. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p24.54">On the one side, the MST was organising occupations of unproductive lands based on the idea that they were supported by the Constitution. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p24.54">On the other side, landowners were defending their private properties, also a constitutional right. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p24.54">The government, caught in the middle, tried to please both sides promising agrarian reform and assuring proprietors they would not be the losers. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p24.54">Wright and Wolford (2003, 105) estimated that, just between 1985 and 1987, 377 rural workers and peasants were murdered in land conflicts. </s>
</p>
<p n="p25.54">
<s n="s1.3;p25.54">By the end of the 1980s, the state had neither delivered a satisfactory reform nor protected the properties from MST invasions. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p25.54">After five years of administration, the president Jose Sarney had achieved just 6% of the PRNA objectives. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p25.54">The situation in the following decade worsened, as the state took economic measures that had direct influence on the rural population. </s>

<s n="s3.5;p53.54">Second, the reduction of fiscal deficit led the state to cut drastically credit to farmers. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p53.54">The budgetary cuts had an impact on infrastructure investments as well, leaving no room for the creation of new jobs to acommodate the rural unemployed. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p53.54">Third, high interest rates, set by the government to curb inflation, rendered commercial banks' loans unaffordable; many proprietors lost their land. </s>
</p>
<p n="p54.54">
<s n="s1.2;p54.54">Economic recession proved to be a fertile ground for the rise and natiowide spread of the landless movement, which comprised almost 70,000 families in 1999. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p54.54">The reaction of the World Bank - setting up a fund for agrarian reform - is consistent with our view that the SAPs underlie the fast growth of the landless movement in the 1990s. </s>
