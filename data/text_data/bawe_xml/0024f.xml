<s n="s1.4;p1.40">The prime reason for the popularity of melodrama in the latter half of the eighteenth and throughout the nineteenth centuries was its inclusion of all those ingredients ensuring audience appeal. </s>

<s n="s3.4;p1.40">Similar to the enormously popular soap operas of today, the content of any typical melodrama would doubtless include emotions of comedy, tragedy and sentiment expressed through easily identifiable stock characterisation. </s>

</p>
<p n="p4.40">
<s n="s1.3;p4.40">
<hi rend="italic">The Murder in the Red Barn</hi> has become a legend. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p4.40">The play has all the popular elements of melodrama, the villain, William Corder, charged for the murder of the poor, innocent village maiden- Maria Martin. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p4.40">The death of Martin's child, the respectable father figure and his wife's mysterious dream by which the murder was discovered. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.40">
<s n="s1.4;p5.40">The fact that this play is based on an actual event however, is the prime reason why it reflected the contemporary social climate. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p5.40">Maria Martin was murdered in the Red Barn. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p5.40">Her lover, William Corder, was arrested on suspect of the murder, brought to trial and executed at Bury St Edmunds in August 1828. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p5.40">The play serves as a suitable opening to my discussion as it demonstrates a centre ground for what the audiences of the time were seeking. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.40">
<s n="s1.5;p6.40">Although the true-life incidents alone were incredibly popular amongst the people, the facts of the highly complex event were changed radically to make it even more popular on the stage. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p6.40">Even before the trial of William Corder, the elements of the case were being sensationalised by media hype. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p6.40">As the Nineteenth Century progressed, new elements of were grafted on to the story until, when the play was performed in 1877, the murder had been perfectly primed to create maximum appeal for the audience. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p6.40">However well the murder fitted with the trends on stage, the story was altered, as were the characters of the people involved. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p6.40">Subplots were created in keeping with the typical melodramas contemporary audiences would have been used to. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.40">
<s n="s1.3;p7.40">For example, little of Maria's true character was conveyed in the play - she had to be presented as the typical victim. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p7.40">She has very little to do on stage other than wait anxiously for Corder and follow the instructions he gives her. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p7.40">Her dialogue is sugary and innocent, </s>
</p>
<quote lang="English"> 'Yes charming angel, when I cease to love that heart which beats so fervently in union with mine, may every hope on earth desert me, and my fortune's purest, brightest, smile beam unpropitious.'</quote>
<p n="p8.40">
<s n="s1.3;p8.40">The fact that the real Maria had had incestuous affairs with first Corder's brother, Thomas, then a married man, Peter Matthews before William, and moreover, that she had given birth to three illegitimate children, is erased from the narrative. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p8.40">The theme of the 'fallen woman' did not become popular amongst audiences until later melodramas. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p8.40">The audience are only presented with Maria's anxiety to legalise her union with Corder. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.40">
<s n="s1.3;p9.40">Although it is true that the real Maria had a sister- Ann Martin, the subplot of Ann's relationship with Timothy Bobbin, was created purely as a form of comical relief running parallel to the central narrative. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p9.40">Their comic roles, together with the gypsy type character Johnny Raw, were popular to melodrama and were therefore added to satisfy audience expectations. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p9.40">They bear no relation to the murder narrative, </s>
</p>
<quote lang="English">ANN: 'Yes you will Timothy; and what's more, you'll kiss me too.' TIMOTHY: 'Shall I? When?' ANN: 'When you catch me' (<hi rend="italic">Runs Off</hi>). TIMOTHY: 'Dang'd if I don't try!' (<hi rend="italic">Runs after her</hi>).</quote>
<p n="p10.40">
<s n="s1.6;p10.40">Many of the elements of <hi rend="italic">The Murder in the Red Barn</hi> are similar to the typical traits of a Gothic drama. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p10.40">A few to include would be the thrill of the unknown, great mystery and darkness and stereotypical settings- secluded and ominous in order to inspire terror. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p10.40">According to the confession of the real William Corder, he shot Maria on his arrival at the barn before he buried her. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p10.40">Horrific as this must have been, melodrama made it even more so. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p10.40">After Maria's exclamation, 'Oh William, William, to thee I trust for future happiness!' </s>
<s n="s6.6;p10.40">Corder enters and a sinister atmosphere builds throughout their dialogue, in which the true characterisation of the villain and the victim are allowed full glory, </s>
</p>
<quote lang="English">MARIA: 'Am I not a poor, forlorn, frail thing, whose heart is bruised and bleeding with excess of agony- whose form is bowed with suffering miseries?' CORDER: 'Tis time the mask should fall, and you know me as I really am.'</quote>

<s n="s1.1;p11.40">This precedes a violent struggle, in which Corder attempts to stab her twice before succeeding, </s>

<quote lang="English">MARIA: 'Spare me! Mercy!' CORDER: 'I have none. Thou diest! No struggling.'</quote>
<p n="p12.40">
<s n="s1.4;p12.40">Although the character traits and settings in the play are typical of the Gothic genre, a clear shift in audience taste and social climate is demonstrated in <hi rend="italic">The Murder in the Red Barn</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p12.40">That is, a moving away from the sublime in the narrative, replacing it with real life events to place the audiences' familiar ground on the stage, as was the desire in the nineteenth century. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p12.40">Both the audiences of the play and the thousands of people eager to acquire a souvenir from the actual crime scene were quick to admit that they really only cared about the entertainment provided by the incident. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p12.40">Justice was not considered much of an importance, 'Every one of them was anxious to carry away something memorial...pieces of the barn-door, tiles from the roof, and, above all, the clothes of the poor victim, were eagerly sought after.'<ref target="BAWE_0024f-ftnote.003"/> </s>

<s n="s4.5;p17.40">A prime difference between <hi rend="italic">The Murder in the Red Barn</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Bells</hi> is the move away in the latter from the stereotypical 'character' melodrama. </s>
