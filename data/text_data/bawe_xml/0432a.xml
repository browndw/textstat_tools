<s n="s1.2;p52.55">We have tried to disentangle the individual effects of social, demographic, nutritional, economic and health care behavioral factors on Childhood mortality in India through a cross sectional analysis of data from 520 districts in India. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p52.55">Results from this analysis may be questioned on several grounds. </s>
</p>
<p n="p53.55">
<s n="s1.3;p53.55">Firstly we have not been able to include some variables on which data was not available but which have been proved to be relevant in earlier studies. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p53.55">This might have caused some omitted variable bias in our results since they are likely to be correlated with other independent variables. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p53.55">These include female labour force participation, separate male and female mortality rates and literacy among mothers. </s>
</p>
<p n="p54.55">
<s n="s1.5;p54.55">Secondly, the error terms in our model may be spatially correlated, i.e. their value at any point in space might be correlated with the values of surrounding points. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p54.55">I have tried to correct for this by including more variables to take care of the correlation between error terms. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p54.55">I have also tried to include state and region dummies into the equation to take care of spatial correlation. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p54.55">The results were similar to ones above. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p54.55">However, if spatial correlation is still present it would give us unrealistic standard errors and show some insignificant variables to be significant. </s>
</p>
<p n="p55.55">
<s n="s1.13;p55.55">If we overlook these problems with our model, our analysis can yield some interesting policy prescriptions. </s>
<s n="s2.13;p55.55">Previous research has already laid stress on direct government interventions in Reproductive and Child Health and we shall not repeat that point, although two things are worth mentioning. </s>
<s n="s3.13;p55.55">One is the importance of antenatal care and the other is the quality of health care facilities provided by the government. </s>
<s n="s4.13;p55.55">The increased likelihood of child mortality among severely undernourished children implies that the state should identify them and allocate resources to save them. </s>
<s n="s5.13;p55.55">Such a focused strategy would be much more efficient in reducing the incidence of infant and child mortality and helping India achieve the targets set in the Millenium Development Goals, which seem far fetched going the current rate. </s>
<s n="s6.13;p55.55">Despite the fact that child marriage is illegal in our country, it is still highly prevalent in rural settings. </s>
<s n="s7.13;p55.55">Our analysis shows that increased proportion of girls married at the less than 18 years increases the infant mortality rates. </s>
<s n="s8.13;p55.55">Strict law enforcement and spread of awareness about the ill effects of child marriage are required. </s>
<s n="s9.13;p55.55">Secondly the study shows that social deprivation can be a very important factor influencing childhood mortality. </s>
<s n="s10.13;p55.55">Hence, measures need to be taken to improve the social standing of females, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. </s>
<s n="s11.13;p55.55">There is also a need to address the living conditions of slum dwellers in urban areas. </s>
<s n="s12.13;p55.55">Measures such as reservations that have been taken over the years to uplift the backward classes have clearly not had their impact on the lowest quartiles. </s>
<s n="s13.13;p55.55">The government then probably needs to review its strategy tackle deprivation among backward classes. </s>
