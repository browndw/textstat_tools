<s n="s1.7;p1.19">Organisational culture influences individual and group behaviour and it can be managed to facilitate success within groups and organisations. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p1.19">There has been academic debate whether highly integrated organisational culture, "strong" organisational culture is a key factor in success. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p1.19">It can be argued that stimulation of individuals within the organisation to high performance and contribution to their well-being is feasible for any organisation. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p1.19">Thus, finding a suitable organisational culture is important in human resources management (HRM) considerations. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p1.19">However, the precise nature of an appropriate organisational culture is disputable, for example the official descriptions of companies do not reflect how the life as a part of the organisation is perceived by individuals and groups. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p1.19">In the light of cases in organisational culture it is possible to derive support to both sides of the academic debate. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p1.19">Nevertheless, the extent of integration of the ideal organisational culture seems to be limited, even though there is a clear case for ensuring the element of control in a successful organisational culture. </s>

<head rend="bold">2. "Strong" Organisational Culture</head>
<p n="p2.19">
<s n="s1.2;p2.19">In order to understand the scope of "strong" organisational culture, the concept of organisational culture has to be clarified. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p2.19">Schein defined organisational culture in his work: </s>

</p>
</note>
<p n="p3.19">
<s n="s1.1;p3.19">Schein's definition is broad and it can be rather easily observed that the definition allows a wide inclusion of factors into concept of organisational culture. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.19">
<s n="s1.2;p4.19">However, "strong" organisational cultures have distinguishing characteristics. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p4.19">Firstly and most importantly, the vision of the organisational culture is strict in "strong" cultures, as Rosenfeld and Wilson define it: </s>

<p n="p5.19">
<s n="s1.4;p5.19">It must be noticed here that Wilson is a critic of so-called "excellence school" that is in favour of "strong"-culture theory. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p5.19">But, it is clear that the definitive characteristic of "strong" culture is the drive for integration and it discourages anything that is in contradiction of its perceived essence. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p5.19">Secondly, in "strong" cultures there is a certain level of control to discourage devious behaviour. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p5.19">Methods used to discourage particular types of behaviour are often sanctions and failures to reward. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.19">
<s n="s1.3;p6.19">The integrity in "strong" cultures must be enforced, it is arguably not self-sustaining, as sub-cultures will eventually develop and deviate from the original culture. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p6.19">Porter et al argued that there is an observable connection in numerous cases of a "strong" organisational culture accompanied with financial success and increased competitiveness.<ref target="BAWE_0094b-ftnote.003"/> This implies that any deviations should indeed be discouraged. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p6.19">Porter et al based their arguments on findings of Sorensen, who found empirical evidence of existence of a relationship between "strong" cultures and financial success. <ref target="BAWE_0094b-ftnote.004"/> </s>

<s n="s1.1;p7.19">On the contrary, Wilson has argued already in 1992 that similar conclusion can be reached, but the underlying theoretical issues are supported by questionable empirical evidence; his argumentation was a reply to such findings by Kotter et al.<ref target="BAWE_0094b-ftnote.005"/> Wilson identified four limitations of the empirical proof: </s>

<head rend="bold">3. Uses and limitations of a "strong" organisational culture</head>
<p n="p14.19">
<s n="s1.4;p14.19">Even though the cases below are primarily about the "strong" organisational culture, the three models of corporate culture and organisational performance can be identified in the cases below. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p14.19">In addition to "strong" culture theory, there is "culture-fit" theory, which encourages adaptation to the values of environment, but paying attention to the internal values as well. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p14.19">Secondly, in so-called "adaptive-culture" theory the values of the culture are seen as tools of adapting to change in the environment. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p14.19">The characteristics of the three theories can be overlapping as well in some cases they can be mutually inclusive, i.e. they all can be observed in a "strong" culture. </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.19">
<s n="s1.4;p15.19">A classic case of a "strong" organisational culture is Ford Motor Company. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p15.19">The organisational culture of the car manufacturing giant was very "strong" in the early twentieth century, it did not allow deviations from the rules of the organisation.<ref target="BAWE_0094b-ftnote.008"/> They had their own "Sociological department" that enforced "aright" behaviour of the workers at work and in their free time, any failures to comply with company standards resulted in a reduced wage or expulsion.<ref target="BAWE_0094b-ftnote.009"/> Such high level of control created employee discomfort and it arguably contributed into the already large labour turnover. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p15.19">To illustrate, in 1913 turnover was 423% in spite of relatively high wages.<ref target="BAWE_0094b-ftnote.010"/> Individuals tend to dislike excessive control, certain extent of privacy is needed, workers are barely happy in an Orwellian<ref target="BAWE_0094b-ftnote.011"/> organisational culture. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p15.19">Hence, high level of control can cause negative impact on individuals and this speaks against "strong" organisational cultures. </s>

<s n="s2.6;p16.19">This can be depicted in the example of skin and body products retailer The Body Shop. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p16.19">The majority of The Body Shop's outlets are franchises and there is a very limited amount of control, the franchisees can sell their own related products and modify the store concept, which has been a key to their success.<ref target="BAWE_0094b-ftnote.012"/> However, in early 1990s a franchisee of six outlets, suffering of a mental disorder without her managers knowing of it, became hostile to the culture of the company and let her outlets to degrade, which resulted in damage to company's reputation and extensive litigation and the top management was forced to escalate the level of control.<ref target="BAWE_0094b-ftnote.013"/> On basis of The Body Shop's case, it can be argued that some level of control is needed in order to eliminate the risk of hostile deviations against the organisational culture itself. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p16.19">The organisational culture is a means of management and the managers should appreciate and manage it rather than to let the culture to guide themselves. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p16.19">Organisations such as The Body Shop claim that their success is largely based on freedoms of the franchisees and this is clearly the case. </s>

<s n="s3.5;p18.19">For example, in his work Greenberg describes Starbucks as a healthy organisational culture, due to its low turnover.<ref target="BAWE_0094b-ftnote.014"/> Indeed, the culture at Starbucks appears to ensure the employee welfare and it is characterised by integrated values.<ref target="BAWE_0094b-ftnote.015"/> But, pressure groups argue that the organisation exploits the Third World and promotes inequality in the developing countries.<ref target="BAWE_0094b-ftnote.016"/> Greenberg's view is solely finance-based, and hence limited. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p18.19">This implies that wider considerations of all levels, individual, group, organisational and environmental, should be made about judgement of the success of an organisational culture. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p18.19">Starbucks might be a profitable organisation, but the negative economic externalities sourcing from their failure to respond to the needs of their environment reduces dramatically the value of Starbucks as an example of a successful "strong" organisational culture. </s>

<s n="s2.5;p19.19">Element of control seems to be the most crucial and disputable one, but there is a demand for a certain level of control in order to ensure that the employees work towards the goals agreed on by management. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p19.19">However, excessive control causes discomfort amongst individuals and groups leading into reduced motivation to work. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p19.19">Nevertheless, managers must make their choices about HRM solutions and try to adjust the organisational culture to what is most suitable for them, as it is by no means clear whether to choose "strong" culture or not. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p19.19">It is not likely that the academic debate will be solved in favour of one side or the other, as the real world is one of diversity and uncertainty and therefore, the power of models is restricted. </s>
