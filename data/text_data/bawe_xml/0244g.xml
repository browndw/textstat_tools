<p n="p1.17">
<s n="s1.4;p1.17">In contrast to the majority of European countries it was only in the years before 1914 that industrialisation began to rapidly occur in Russia. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p1.17">As with other industrialising countries this brought with it many problems such as poor working conditions, long hours and a move from the countryside to more urban areas. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p1.17">The reason that this caused such radicalism in the Russian labour movement particularly, and not to such an extent in the rest of Europe, can be attributed to many factors. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p1.17">Rebellious traditions, an oppressive regime which seemed to give more freedom with the October Manifesto but then took it all away again, and the presence of a revolutionary intelligentsia all contributed to growing radicalism in the labour movement. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.17">
<s n="s1.5;p2.17">Firstly I will look at the effect of industrialisation and a Marxist theory attempting to explain the revolutionary tendencies of the Russian labour movement explored by the historian Christopher Read. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p2.17">Some Socialist Soviet historians believed that the radicalism came from two types of worker; 'advanced' and 'backward'. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p2.17">'Advanced' workers are thought to have been radical because "the further a worker developed away from the countryside the more revolutionary, the more 'conscious' and the more 'advanced' s/he was thought to become." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0244g-ftnote.001"/>
<s n="s4.5;p2.17">As they often experienced the rise to becoming a skilled labourer and therefore higher wages, they expected more, had more to lose and gained better literacy levels to understand what was going on in the world around them. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p2.17">This then made them more likely to strike or take part in organised rebellions against the Tsar. </s>
</p>
<note place="foot" id="BAWE_0244g-ftnote.001">
<p n="pn1.1">
<s n="s1.1;pn1.1">Christopher Read 'Labour and Socialism in Tsarist Russia' in Dick Geary (ed.) <hi rend="italic">Labour and Socialist Movements in Europe before 1914</hi> (Oxford, 1992) p. 158. </s>
</p>
</note>
<p n="p3.17">
<s n="s1.4;p3.17">The argument for the 'backward' worker is that "those who were left behind in the process, low paid, short-term, frequently female workers, were thought to be 'backward', lacking in 'consciousness' and even potentially counter-revolutionary." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0244g-ftnote.002"/>
<s n="s2.4;p3.17">These people would riot spontaneously as opposed to plan a rebellion but could be a threat to the stability of the state in the same way as the 'advanced' workers. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p3.17">Although Read goes on to point out that the theory is not accurate for the majority of Russian labourers, it is a good starting point to see the potential effects on labour militancy of a rapid period of industrialisation. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p3.17">In addition, it is due to this background of societal change that meant that a variety of other factors had a greater effect on the radicalisation of the labour movement. </s>

</p>
</note>
<p n="p4.17">
<s n="s1.3;p4.17">Possibly the most important group of people in encouraging radicalism were the university educated thinkers and writers, the intelligentsia, who were much better received due to the unstable condition of Russian society. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p4.17">This existence of "a brilliant, creative and, in many cases, heroically self-sacrificing intelligentsia devoted to the eradication of social injustice in Russia"<ref target="BAWE_0244g-ftnote.003"/> ensured that labour in Russia would retain its radicalism. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p4.17">They were able to do this as parties, circles and workers' groups tended to consist of a small intellectual nucleus around which clustered a group of workers enabling the intelligentsia to stand by and, when the opportunity arose, became the articulators and leaders of the mass labour movement. <ref target="BAWE_0244g-ftnote.004"/> </s>

<p n="p5.17">
<s n="s1.5;p5.17">Another important factor which contributed to labour radicalism was the existence, and sometimes non-existence, of trade unions. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p5.17">I say this because trade unions were legalised and prohibited throughout the years leading up to 1914 and under either circumstance there was instability for the state. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p5.17">The existence of legal labor organisations before 1905 had a great affect on the workers; two in particular run by Sergei Zubatov in Moscow and Georgii Gapon in St. Petersburg. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p5.17">Despite membership being quite small "thousands came into contact with these organizations through lectures and meetings" and the different sections served as "centres for discussion and formulation of economic demands." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0244g-ftnote.005"/>
<s n="s5.5;p5.17">In addition there was the emergence of a Central Bureau of Trade Unions in St. Petersburg in1906 which led to "the unionization of some 9,500 'militant' metalworkers in the space of just three months."<ref target="BAWE_0244g-ftnote.006"/> </s>

</note>
<p n="p6.17">
<s n="s1.4;p6.17">Also in St. Petersburg the presence of trade unions led to the employers forming the Petersburg Society of Mill and Factory Workers (PSMFO) and their "consistent refusal to accept the unions as legitimate bargaining agents for 'their' workers became central points in employer argumentation and practice in this period." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0244g-ftnote.007"/>
<s n="s2.4;p6.17">The struggle between the two sides led to increased radicalism and it is thought that the workers protest became less spontaneous and more intentional. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p6.17">Therefore the summer strikes generated new types of protest with "work slowdowns, boycotts on jobs and work orders, picketing, and work stoppages in selected shops." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0244g-ftnote.008"/>
<s n="s4.4;p6.17">These types of action were much more infuriating for the owners and it was often harder for them to find proof and punish those who were responsible. </s>

</note>
<p n="p7.17">
<s n="s1.6;p7.17">However even when trade unions were banned, for example with the 1912 Convention, it did not ease the tensions and arguably forced the workers into more aggressive and radical ways of protesting. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p7.17">Changes in the way the workers expressed their opinion were doubly problematic for the state because they were the front line for the protests even if they were not protesting against the Tsar. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p7.17">This was because "Relations between workers and employers were frequently mediated by government authorities, transforming conflicts over workplace conditions into political confrontations." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0244g-ftnote.009"/>
<s n="s4.6;p7.17">It is argued that the Tsar should have helped the situation by taking steps to de-politicise industrial relations but "in the prevailing conditions nothing could have been more difficult to implement,"<ref target="BAWE_0244g-ftnote.010"/> and the state would have probably ended up losing the majority of its control over the factories. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p7.17">The final problem with the prohibiting of trade unions is that the workers were left with no other way to express their views except by becoming more aggressive or trying the traditional method of petitioning the Tsar directly. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p7.17">However, petitioning the Tsar could be a dangerous step as many found out at the beginning of the 1905 Revolution. </s>

<s n="s2.5;p8.17">Despite the workers' peaceful intentions the Tsar's troops fired upon them killing and injuring many and causing uproar from workers across the Russian Empire. </s>
