<s n="s1.4;p1.7">George Moore experienced many problems with the circulating libraries and publishers when seeking to publish his novel <hi rend="underlined">Esther Waters</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p1.7">Some of his earlier works such as <hi rend="underlined">A Modern Lover</hi> (1884) had been deemed not suitable for family readership due to their lack of "moral proportion"<ref target="BAWE_3003d-ftnote.001"/> and consequently some of them were banned. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p1.7">I would like to discuss why <hi rend="underlined">Esther Waters</hi> in particular was so shocking to its original readers, and what it has to do specifically with its heroine. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p1.7">I feel it would also be interesting to compare Esther with Hardy's heroine Tess (<hi rend="underlined">Tess of the D'Urbervilles</hi> 1891) as similar figures in society, yet who experience contrasting ends. </s>

<s n="s1.10;p2.7">George Moore (1852-1933) was the son of an Irish landowner and racehorse breeder, and with little early education, he was hardly literate at 16 years old. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p2.7">After his father died he went to study in Paris and during his time in France he was influenced greatly by the young artists and writers of the time. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p2.7">He was particularly influenced by the social realist novelists, such as Zola and Balzac, who were interested in the idea of 'telling the truth'<ref target="BAWE_3003d-ftnote.002"/> and exposing social injustice. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p2.7">As a novelist, Moore saw his role as writing "contemporary history, an exact and complete reproduction of social surroundings of the age we live in".<ref target="BAWE_3003d-ftnote.003"/> When composing <hi rend="underlined">Esther Waters</hi>, he wrote to a friend that "people have always written how servants worry us. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p2.7">I am going to write about how we worry servants"<ref target="BAWE_3003d-ftnote.004"/>. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p2.7">When considering why the novel was so shocking, it is important to consider the context of the Victorian period that Moore was writing in. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p2.7">Samuel Johnson had proclaimed a century before "for vice is necessary to be shown, should always disgust"<ref target="BAWE_3003d-ftnote.005"/> and the novel was certainly a place where the narrative was strictly used to make moral judgements. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p2.7">Chastity was the "cardinal value"<ref target="BAWE_3003d-ftnote.006"/> and any character that did not conform was normally given a minor role and would face a tragic consequence. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p2.7">Yet in <hi rend="underlined">Esther Waters</hi>, the central protagonist is an illiterate female, a working class servant and a single mother with an illegitimate child. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p2.7">On all accounts the main subject of Moore's novel is shocking. </s>

<s n="s1.8;p3.7">Tess is also a 'fallen woman', a single mother and a working servant and she faces similar plot circumstances. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p3.7">Yet Tess, who is distinct above her peers by her beauty and descent, faces the tragedy of her child dying, marrying and killing her seducer and execution at the end. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p3.7">I would like to discuss how Esther's representation is different from Tess' in identical situations, as a suggestion of why their consequences are so different. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p3.7">When Esther gives birth to Jackie<ref target="BAWE_3003d-ftnote.007"/>, the narrative describes the scene with a high level of subjectivity, although it starts objectively, we soon see the scene and those characters in it from Esther's point of view. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p3.7">We read how she feels and what she thinks as the narrative even stops and starts with her consciousness. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p3.7">The birth, although an illegitimate one, is still seen as a celebration; in stark contrast to Tess' birth, which is not even mentioned. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p3.7">Esther is able to confess her incident to her mother<ref target="BAWE_3003d-ftnote.008"/> with direct speech clearly and explicitly without pretence, whereas Tess's confession is simply mentioned in the narrative. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p3.7">Tess mournfully procrastinates her confession to Angel and we finally read that "her narrative ended"<ref target="BAWE_3003d-ftnote.009"/> whereas Esther is forthright and without disguise as she explains the truth to Fred, even dictating a possible response that he might have.<ref target="BAWE_3003d-ftnote.010"/> In conclusion to the comparison, it is clear that Moore gives Esther the voice, through direct speech and narrative focalisation, to express her feelings and actions, in contrast to Tess who is the passive recipient of her circumstances. </s>

<s n="s4.5;p6.7">Hardy writes long, dense scene-setting paragraphs that, although Tess may be in the scene, are completely distant from and regardless of her, whereas Moore is always concerned (often through Esther's use of rhetorical questions) with Esther in a situation. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p6.7">At Derby Day<ref target="BAWE_3003d-ftnote.015"/>, we do not read much about the horse racing itself, because Esther does not know much about it, instead Moore depicts the hustle and bustle of the crowd because it interests Esther. </s>
