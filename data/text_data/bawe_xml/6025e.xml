<p n="p21.26">
<s n="s1.12;p21.26">A closed circuit Spirometer is used in this experiment. </s>
<s n="s2.12;p21.26">The Spirometer is filled with air and subject breath through the mouth piece. </s>
<s n="s3.12;p21.26">Valves are presents in the tube ensuring that gas only travel one-way. </s>
<s n="s4.12;p21.26">Expired air passed through a soda lime carbon dioxide absorber before it enters the Spirometer. </s>
<s n="s5.12;p21.26">It is very important to keep the carbon dioxide content low in the gas in Spirometer. </s>
<s n="s6.12;p21.26">High carbon dioxide content in Spirometer gas will suppress the rate of diffusion of carbon dioxide form the alveolar capillaries to the alveolar space, leaving a high partial pressure of carbon dioxide in subject's blood. </s>
<s n="s7.12;p21.26">The high [HCO <hi rend="sub">3</hi>-] in circulation lowers the blood pH and the subject will experience acidosis. </s>
<s n="s8.12;p21.26">Therefore, it is very important to keep the carbon dioxide content in Spirometer low or similar to natural exciting value (partial pressure of carbon dioxide under barometric pressure = 0.3mmHg). </s>
<s n="s9.12;p21.26">As majority of carbon dioxide expired is absorbed by the soda lime filter, the total gas volume in the Spirometer decreases with time. </s>
<s n="s10.12;p21.26">It is demonstrated in the spirograph that the trace tends to rise with time. </s>
<s n="s11.12;p21.26">The total carbon dioxide production is approximately equal to the decrease in volume of the gas chamber in Spriometer. </s>
<s n="s12.12;p21.26">The rate of carbon dioxide production is equivalent to the slope of Spirograph trace. </s>
</p>
<p n="p22.26">
<s n="s1.5;p22.26">The result shows that subject have a relatively larger total lung capacity and residual volume comparing with the average value in the same age and sex group. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p22.26">Subject has a larger tidal volume and smaller Inspiratory reserve volume and expiratory reserve volume compare to the average value. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p22.26">These indicate that subject is breathing deeper than normal people, and this is related to the muscular training of the subject. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p22.26">Subject is an active choir member and she had regular training for more than ten years. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p22.26">Those training strengthen the elastic fibres and so they are able overcome the compliance of lungs allowing the lungs to inflate and deflate at a faster rate. </s>
