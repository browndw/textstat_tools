<s n="s3.4;p1.91">The company has been chosen on the basis different parameters like brand name, specialty of products etc. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p1.91">Though Fabindia is a well-known name in India and to some extent around the world, it has only recently ventured in to the export market, which gives us the opportunity to analyze and maybe predict its future course of action. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p2.91">American entrepreneur John Bissell founded Fabindia, expanded to fabulous India, in 1960. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p2.91">The company is unique as all its products are sourced from "7500 craftsman and artistes" (fabindia.com, 2005) from all over India, mainly rural parts. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p2.91">Through this unique feature Fabindia has been able to keep alive India's traditional textile industry while creating a distinct style of its own. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p4.91">The product is the most important element of the marketing mix of Fabindia. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p4.91">Right from the time it was founded in 1960, its product offering is how Fabindia differentiates itself from the competition. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p4.91">Its product mix and branding and how Fabindia uses them to market effectively is discussed in the following section. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p5.91">The first of three levels of the product (Strategic Marketing notes, 2005) is the core product that deals with what the buyer is actually buying. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p5.91">For Fabindia, providing the core benefit translates to providing furnishings to decorate homes. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p5.91">It is at the second level, when the actual product is formed and attributes like quality, features etc. are incorporated, that Fabindia has done exceedingly well. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p5.91">Fabindia aims for people who want "fashionable products at reasonable prices " (Fabindia.com/presskit) hence, it has made its <hi rend="italic">offered</hi> product different from the g <hi rend="italic">eneric</hi> product of home furnishings. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p5.91">(Levitt, 1980). </s>
<s n="s6.6;p5.91">This differentiation appeals more to Fabindia's customers. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.91">
<s n="s1.3;p6.91">The third and final level, augmented product is where Fabindia can make its presence felt in the UK. It has just started exporting via its e-commerce site, which has very basic offerings on warranty, delivery and credit aspects. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p6.91">Now, in order for Fabindia to do well it has to come up with attractive offers like delivery slabs of 7 days /10 days/15 days and charge accordingly. </s>

<s n="s1.1;p11.91">- The depth, though varying for various products, is still substantial, with cushion covers having 126 variants (including 18 types and 7 colours) and placemats having 7 variants. </s>

<p rend="bulleted" n="p12.91">
<s n="s1.1;p12.91">- All product lines of Fabindia are soft furnishings that go`through the same distribution channels i.e. either piecewise`through their website or through wholesale distribution, which makes them closely related hence consistent. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p14.91">_ <hi rend="italic">By expanding width by adding more product lines:</hi> The actual product width of Fabindia is huge, including tableware, lamps etc., but being a new entrant in the export market it has not offered many of its products. </s>

</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p15.91">
<s n="s1.1;p15.91">_ Considering demand of its exported products it can think of adding more distribution channels or even opening up stores in UK. This area has been dealt with in detail further in the assignment when the distribution strategy of Fabindia is discussed. </s>

<head rend="bold">3.1.3 Branding</head>
<figure id="BAWE_0090b-pic.002"/>
<p n="p16.91">
<s n="s1.3;p16.91">Of all the product considerations, branding is most important to Fabindia's exporting success. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p16.91">A growing market segment of people are aspiring to have and 'elite-life style' (Hassan and Katsanis, 1995: 140) on a global scale, which can be cited as one of the reasons for Fabindia's success at the domestic and international level. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p16.91">Its success in branding can be understood if an analysis of the 'brand levels' (Kotler, 2000: 404) is done: </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p17.91">
<s n="s1.1;p17.91">_ <hi rend="italic">Attributes:</hi> Fabindia suggests a casual carefree and a free spirited attitude. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p18.91">
<s n="s1.2;p18.91">_ <hi rend="italic">Benefits:</hi> The brand provides a functional benefit of a high quality product and thus durable. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p18.91">The emotional benefit is of experiencing the culture of a country, India in this case. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p19.91">
<s n="s1.1;p19.91">_ <hi rend="italic">Values:</hi> Fabindia is associated with values like creativity and social responsibility providing employment to the poorer people of India. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p20.91">
<s n="s1.1;p20.91">_ <hi rend="italic">Culture:</hi> Fabindia represents the Indian culture standing for diversity, colour and uniqueness. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p21.91">
<s n="s1.1;p21.91">_ <hi rend="italic">Personality:</hi> Fabindia suggests a very vibrant, trendy and tasteful personality. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p22.91">
<s n="s1.1;p22.91">_ <hi rend="italic">User:</hi> Fabindia does not really suggest the age group of its target users but considering its price range and intellectual image its brand image would appeal to all age groups alike. </s>
</p>
<p n="p23.91">
<s n="s1.5;p23.91">In his article David Aaker clearly states that until and unless a company is facing a strategic threat or an emerging opportunity, it should not think about "vertical extension of its brand or repositioning". </s>
<s n="s2.5;p23.91">Fabindia has always branded itself as being a high quality, niche market company. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p23.91">This has partly to do with the quality of its products which are very high together with a feeling in people that they are wearing something authentically Indian. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p23.91">This can be cited as one of the reasons behind its success in exporting to countries like USA, Italy etc. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p23.91">Fabindia is replicating the same brand strategy in the UK, which can be seen on their website. </s>

<head rend="bold italic">3.2 Pricing</head>
<p n="p24.91">
<s n="s1.2;p24.91">The importance of pricing cannot be over estimated in the success of any product, but in Fabindia's case it is more interesting as numerous small companies in the UK sell literally the same products having the same appeal at lower prices. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p24.91">In this section various pricing strategies of Fabindia that will help it cope with the new market will be looked at. </s>
</p>
<div4>
<head rend="bold">3.2.1 Value based pricing</head>
<p n="p25.91">
<s n="s1.4;p25.91">Nagle and Holden in their book 'The strategy and tactics of pricing' write that "it is important not simply to process orders at whatever price customers are willing to pay but rather to raise customers' willingness to pay a price that better reflects the products true value", which is what Fabindia exactly does. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p25.91">Customers buying Fabindia products buy-in to the <hi rend="italic">value</hi> it has to offer rather than the <hi rend="italic">price</hi>. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p25.91">Taking a look at the history of Fabindia's pricing strategy in India and abroad it can be found that it never gives away a discount on its products, which means that customer satisfaction is due to the inherent quality that the customer see in the product, rather than the discount. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p25.91">This helps Fabindia to steer clear of competition as its customers show loyalty. </s>
</p>
</div4>
<div4>
<head rend="bold">3.2.2 Product line pricing</head>
<p n="p26.91">
<s n="s1.3;p26.91">Fabindia is using a product line pricing strategy (Kotler, 2000:475) whereby it has well established price levels for its products. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p26.91">Each of its products has a price ranging from high to medium to low. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p26.91">This can work as a double-edged sword for the company as it might happen that customers associate the various price points to high, medium and low quality products or that Fabindia attracts customers from different classes having varying degrees of paying capacity. </s>
</p>
<p n="p27.91">
<s n="s1.2;p27.91">The Fabindia product brochure on its website clearly communicates the difference between for example, a high priced bed sheet for $235 and a low priced one for $29 (Fabindia.com), in terms of material used, design, kind of artwork and level of craftsmanship. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p27.91">This helps the customers to choose from a wide price range giving them price flexibility. </s>

<head rend="bold italic">3.3 Place - Marketing Channel</head>
<p n="p28.91">
<s n="s1.4;p28.91">This section will look into the important aspect of the availability of products for Fabindia consumers. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p28.91">Its website, <seg type="URL" n="www.fabindia.com"/>, is the main source of exporting goods but it has other options like wholesale exports and upcoming retail stores to give it a foothold in its target markets. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p28.91">As Fabindia has been very successful with its exclusive retail outlets both in India and countries like Italy and U.A.E, it has become a big retail player. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p28.91">The following section will give more insight on how Fabindia can use its marketing channel expertise to replicate the same kind of success in the U.K. </s>

<figure id="BAWE_0090b-pic.003">
<head rend="bold">Fig 3. Fabindia retail store in Rome, Italy</head>
</figure>
<p n="p29.91">
<s n="s1.6;p29.91">Though historically Fabindia has been a wholesale export house it is trying to cash in on its success and brand name by expanding rapidly around the world. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p29.91">It plans to open 12 new stores by 2008, both in India and abroad (Indian Business Insight, 2005) and is on the look out for retail options. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p29.91">Fabindia has evolved from a producer-wholesaler-customer model to producer-retailer-customer as well as to a producer-customer model. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p29.91">Retailing has helped Fabindia successfully increase its turnover manifold and it is now a $ 26m company (The Times of India, 2005). </s>
<s n="s5.6;p29.91">Following the exclusivity route (Stern, El-Ansary and Coughlan, 1996) Fabindia has successfully regulated the type and number of intermediaries it has creating a distinctive dealership advantage. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p29.91">This might have a slight disadvantage, as when demand increases exclusive dealership would not be able to cope with it. </s>
</p>
<p n="p30.91">
<s n="s1.4;p30.91">The main export source of Fabindia has been or will be the direct marketing channel, in this case its e-commerce site. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p30.91">The use of the Internet means that Fabindia can reduce retail costs but in a segment like home furnishings people do want to touch and see a product before buying it, so, it cannot be a long-term strategy. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p30.91">For Fabindia delivery is also a crucial aspect because being a new entrant into the UK market on time delivery will increase customer satisfaction hence customer loyalty of its products. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p30.91">The delivery channel presently used by Fabindia is the courier services of the global company UPS International, which being reputed should help in delivering reliably. </s>
</p>
<p n="p31.91">
<s n="s1.5;p31.91">A combination of the above two models, direct marketing and retail, can work best for Fabindia in the longer term. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p31.91">This is true, especially in UK, as it is a new market for Fabindia and to sell more it does need to establish itself first. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p31.91">Once it has found a customer base and people want to shop again they can do it over the Internet. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p31.91">Also, Fabindia can sell those special products over the Internet that are not present in the retail store. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p31.91">This way it can maximize the advantages of both, retail and direct marketing. </s>
</p>
</div4>
<div4>
<head rend="bold">3.3.2 Wholesaling</head>
<p n="p32.91">
<s n="s1.1;p32.91">Fabindia started as a wholesale export company and though it is focusing on retailing and direct marketing presently, it still carries out wholesale export orders especially for resorts, hotels and corporates. (fabindia.com/business). </s>
</p>
<p n="p33.91">
<s n="s1.3;p33.91">For wholesalers, the minimum order for export is $ 5,000, of which 40 % is advance and the rest is routed through bank, preferably Citibank (Personal reference - Ms. Nisha, Fabindia). </s>
<s n="s2.3;p33.91">Since the minimum order is small, many importers, traders etc. keep on placing orders as per need, season, fashion, and trends. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p33.91">Thus the market penetration is fairly wide and dependency on few clients is avoided as orders/works are spread. </s>
</p>
<p n="p34.91">
<s n="s1.1;p34.91">By concentrating on wholesaling Fabindia is performing a number of marketing functions (Stern, El-Ansary and Coughlan 1996), both for its customers and itself, like: </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p35.91">
<s n="s1.1;p35.91">Market coverage: Fabindia is covering large geographical areas of the necessary markets at a reasonable cost. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p36.91">
<s n="s1.1;p36.91">Sales contact: It is saving the cost of maintaining an outside sales force. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p37.91">
<s n="s1.1;p37.91">Market information: It is getting better feedback on customer product and service requirements. </s>
</p>
<p n="p38.91">
<s n="s1.1;p38.91">Wholesaling is creating a separate kind of market for Fabindia and by giving it due importance, it has kept all its selling options open. </s>
</p>
</div4>
</div3>
<div3>
<head rend="bold italic">3.4 Promotion - Marketing Communications</head>
<p n="p39.91">
<s n="s1.3;p39.91">The place for marketing communication in the mix of Fabindia is interesting. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p39.91">Fabindia as a policy do not advertise anywhere as they are of the opinion that their product in itself is enough advertisement for them. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p39.91">But after entering the foreign market they are concentrating more on promotions, the methods of which we will look in this section. </s>
</p>
<div4>
<head rend="bold">3.4.1 On-line marketing</head>
<p n="p40.91">
<s n="s1.6;p40.91">On line marketing could prove really advantageous for Fabindia, reason being that using the World Wide Web as a marketing tool could "heighten customer satisfaction and loyalty" (Grossman, 1998:13). </s>
<s n="s2.6;p40.91">Products can be customized according to customer needs thereby giving personalized interaction based on a feeling of one to one communication. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p40.91">So when one enters the website of Fabindia, they can look at the available options, decide the colour, type of craft, size of the product etc. and order required quantities of items from their homes globally. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p40.91">Fabindia is trying to cash in on the philosophy of using the Internet for hassle free information to expand its customer base all around the world. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p40.91">Using services like newsletters, personalized web accounts etc., the customer can give feedback or ask for any information. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p40.91">This way Fabindia is creating awareness about its company but more importantly about the "experience" that is Fabindia. </s>
</p>
</div4>
<div4>
<head rend="bold">3.4.2 Public Relations</head>
<p n="p41.91">
<s n="s1.2;p41.91">As far as communicating to its customers goes, public relations are the heart and soul of Fabindia. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p41.91">As discussed earlier, Fabindia does not advertise its products making it unique straightaway and a subject of curiosity for its customers. </s>
</p>
<p n="p42.91">
<s n="s1.6;p42.91">In his article 'PR gets personal', Thomas L Harris suggests, "In its marketing support function, public relations are used to achieve a number of objectives. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p42.91">The most important of these is to raise awareness, to inform and educate, to gain understanding, to build trust, to make friends, to give people reasons (and in some cases permission) to buy and finally to create a climate of consumer acceptance." </s>
