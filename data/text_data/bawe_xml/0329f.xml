<head>Author's Assessment of the Project</head>
<p>This project can be seen to have a high engineering content. In terms of physical engineering design, problems of mounting experimental equipment within the tank were explored fully and solved, allowing for a greater knowledge of how to complete experiments in the future. These could either be done using the equipment produced, or using ideas explored in this project's equipment design. A high aspect of experimental work and theory was also applied in this project, which are essential skills in all engineering fields. This is because in order to further knowledge of certain concepts within engineering, it has to be ensured that previous knowledge is fully understood, which then puts the user in a position to increase this understanding.</p>
<p>This project is very relevant to engineering due to the information gained from it. The relationships between vortex rings and a free surface may have future relevance to commercial engineering applications such as in products such as aircraft that produce a large amount of lift. However, until this knowledge can be applied to commercial applications there is a high value in simply learning about under what circumstances the observed effects apply.</p>
<p>This project should be considered an achievement because it has used a wide range of engineering techniques in order to investigate a specific aim of determining the influence of a free surface on a vortex ring travelling parallel to it. It should also be considered an achievement due to the fact that a certain degree of useful results have been found and analysed in evidence to the specification of the project. However, one weakness of the project is that the results are not entirely conclusive about when a vortex ring will not be affected by a free surface anymore. This would have been achieved if further experiments could have been done.</p>

<head>1.0 Summary</head>
<p n="p1.141">
<s n="s1.1;p1.141">The aim of this project was to investigate the influence of a wall on the movement of a vortex ring travelling in water, with the final intention of determining whether a tank used for vortex generation in the fluids department is big enough so as not to have an effect on the rings produced within it, i.e. whether it can be assumed that there is an infinite distance between the rings and the wall. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.141">
<s n="s1.3;p2.141">An existing vortex ring generator was used with modifications within it in order to vary the distance of a wall from the rings being produced. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p2.141">The rings were produced using a piston/nozzle arrangement, within which the variables of piston velocity and piston stroke length were altered. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p2.141">Altering these variables changed the internal properties and size of the vortex rings produced, enabling comparison between the wall distance and different vortex ring scenarios. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.141">
<s n="s1.4;p3.141">It was discovered that at as the wall distance decreased, the effect on the vortex rings increased to a high extent. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p3.141">In most cases the vortex rings changed direction and moved towards the wall and hit it, instead of continuing in their intended vertical motion. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p3.141">At wall distances of 135mm, only comparatively minor changes in direction were noted. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p3.141">However, greater distances were not experimented with due to physical complications with the tank layout. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.141">
<s n="s1.1;p4.141">Although the evidence cannot be considered as conclusive, the data found does suggest that the diameter of the tank is large enough not effect the movement of the vortex rings within it. </s>

<head>3.0 Introduction</head>
<p n="p5.141">
<s n="s1.2;p5.141">The aim of this project was to investigate the influence of a wall on the movement of a vortex ring travelling in water, with the final intention of determining whether a tank used for vortex generation in the fluids department is big enough so as not to have an effect on the rings produced within it, i.e. whether it can be assumed that there is an infinite distance between the rings and the wall. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p5.141">It was also desirable to determine at what particular distance the wall begins to influence the vortex rings. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.141">
<s n="s1.1;p6.141">The project was put forward by Dr Peter J Thomas as a response to analysts suggesting that the tank of water did not have a large enough diameter for the rings produced within it not to be influenced by the walls. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.141">
<s n="s1.1;p7.141">Experimentation will be done on an existing vortex ring generator with modifications in order to investigate the effect of a wall in the vicinity of the vortex rings. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.141">
<s n="s1.2;p8.141">The vortex rings that have been produced can be thought of as being similar to smoke rings that a proficient smoker can blow. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p8.141">The differences are that in this case the rings are produced in water by the movement of a piston, and are visualised using a dye, rather than through the use of smoke. </s>
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head>4.0 Literature Review</head>
<p n="p9.141">
<s n="s1.4;p9.141">Vortex rings have been investigated to a large extent for at over a century, using increasingly sophisticated methods to produce them and investigate their behaviour. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p9.141">Initially, basic methods such as allowing "a drop of water, lightly colored (sic) with milk or food dye, to fall from an eye-dropper or a burette into a glass of water" (Shariff, 1992) were used. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p9.141">As technology increased more technical and repeatable techniques were developed, producing the method of pushing fluid through a nozzle using a piston. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p9.141">More recently, computer models have been set up in order to model vortex rings, with varying degrees of success. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.141">
<s n="s1.2;p10.141">Vortex rings are not only formed in the laboratory, they are occasionally formed in nature, such as from volcanoes in the form of smoke rings, or even by dolphins in the form of air rings. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p10.141">Figure 4.1 shows a beluga whale blows a ring at the Vancouver Aquarium. </s>
</p>

</figure>
<p n="p11.141">
<s n="s1.2;p11.141">Another case, although not related to this project, is the production of vortex rings as dark solitons decayed in a Bose-Einstein Condensate (Anderson, Haljan, Regal, Feder, Collins, Clark, Cornell). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p11.141">This is an example of how "accelerating ions in superfluid helium create quantized vortex rings" as stated in (Shariff, 1992). </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.141">
<s n="s1.5;p12.141">The technique of vortex ring production, where fluid is pushed through a nozzle is the most commonly used, as it is fairly simple to produce and has a high degree of repeatability. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p12.141">The reason that pushing fluid through a nozzle produces a vortex ring is that "a blob of fluid emerges from the hole", which then "rolls up into the form of an oblate spheroid owing to the self-induction of the vorticity produced at the edge of the hole." </s>
<s n="s3.5;p12.141">(Maxworthy, 1974) or as described by (Glezer, 1988) "The flow separates at the edge of the orifice and a cylindrical vortex sheet forms and rolls up into a vortex ring." </s>
<s n="s4.5;p12.141">A model of this self-similar roll-up is described by Shariff and then modelled and computed to an extent, by Nitsche and Krasny (1994), that photos of actual roll-up and computed roll-up would be fairly difficult to identify from one another by eye. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p12.141">The vortex ring formation process is also modelled to a high extent more recently by Mohseni, Ran, and Colonius (2001). </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.141">
<s n="s1.1;p13.141">Many different aspects of vortex rings have been investigated which include the factors that determine whether a ring is laminar or turbulent, the properties of these forms, interactions between vortex rings and other bodies, and also visually appealing phenomena such as leapfrogging of rings. </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.141">
<s n="s1.4;p14.141">In 1987 Glezer examined the factors which determine whether a "given vortex generator produces either an initially laminar ring, which may or may not undergo instability and transition to turbulence, or an initially turbulent ring." </s>
<s n="s2.4;p14.141">(Glezer, 1988) Through experimentation with different nozzle diameters, piston velocities, and stroke lengths, a "transition map that reveals a reasonably well defined boundary separating vortex rings that are turbulent upon formation from those that are not" (Glezer, 1988) was produced. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p14.141">This was important because a range of dimensionless parameters were formed which allow for translation onto other similar experiments, which do not necessarily use the same geometries. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p14.141">Glezer states that his experimental set up has "properties that make it attractive as a standard" (Glezer, 1988). </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.141">
<s n="s1.10;p15.141">Glezer's work was important because it defined to a reasonable extent when a vortex ring would be either laminar or turbulent on formation. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p15.141">This is important because the properties of laminar and turbulent rings are inherently different from one another. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p15.141">Shariff discusses the properties of laminar and turbulent rings to a high extent in his paper 'Vortex Rings'. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p15.141">Essentially, a turbulent vortex ring can be described as "a compact turbulent region with net linear momentum, statistically invariant with respect to rotation about one axis" (Shariff, 1988) Vortex rings can not only be turbulent initially upon formation, but a laminar vortex ring can also become turbulent. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p15.141">Maxworthy suggests that this is due to an azimuthal instability within the ring core. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p15.141">The conditions that determine whether a vortex ring changes from laminar to turbulent, and possibly back again, depends, according to Maxworthy (1972), on its Renold's number. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p15.141">At low values, a laminar ring will continue its movement until the edge of a tank or another boundary is reached. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p15.141">At a Renold's number of greater than 600, an azimuthal instability will occur, yet the ring will not transform into a turbulent state. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p15.141">For higher values of Renold's number, Maxworthy states that in his observations a ring would gain an azimuthal instability and then "the wavy structure collapsed into a turbulent blob and the vorticity was effectively cancelled by turbulent diffusion" (Maxworthy, 1972). </s>
<s n="s10.10;p15.141">At very large values of Renold's number the ring would become turbulent, an "apparently disorganised vorticity field" (Maxworthy, 1972), and from this a new vortex ring was formed. </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.141">
<s n="s1.4;p16.141">These studies of vortex rings are relevant to the project at hand, due to the fact that the form of vortex ring is relevant to its subsequent activity. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p16.141">However, studies on vortex ring interactions with various bodies have been done which are relevant to a greater extent. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p16.141">Much of these experiments are concerned with the interactions between a vortex ring and objects that are placed in its way. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p16.141">D. Rockwell, in 'Vortex-Body Interactions', investigates the "interactions of a vortex, or combinations of them, with a cylinder, blade, or foil". </s>
</p>
<p n="p17.141">
<s n="s1.4;p17.141">Vortex rings have also been fired towards a wall normal to its axis in order to investigate the effects of the wall on the ring as it draws closer to it, as it collides with it, and after it collides with it. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p17.141">Boldes and Ferreri in 'Behaviour of vortex rings in the vicinity of a wall' investigated this to quite a high extent. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p17.141">In this it was discovered that a "vortex ring traveling (sic) toward a wall situated normal to its axis may undergo momentary inversions of its forward momentum." </s>
<s n="s4.4;p17.141">(Boldes, 1973) </s>
</p>
<p n="p18.141">
<s n="s1.5;p18.141">However, the most relevant piece of research that has been done, in terms of this project, is the work Yue, Zhang, and Shen in their work 'The Mechanism of Vortex Connection at a Free Surface'. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p18.141">This is relevant because they consider a free surface parallel to the axis of the vortex ring, which is the same situation as that in this project. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p18.141">They consider this through numerical modelling of the problem, resulting in some extremely interesting images of the impact of rings with the free surface, which can be related to back to the project work done. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p18.141">Figure 4.2 shows what can be considered as one of the major findings in this work, the evolution of the vortex ring as it approaches and meets the free surface. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p18.141">Yue states, "The key to understanding the mechanism of vortex connection at a free surface is the surface layers": a viscous layer, and a thicker blockage layer. </s>

</figure>
<p n="p19.141">
<s n="s1.2;p19.141">More recently, work on vortex rings has been far more specific and technically complicated. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p19.141">This is due to the fact that the basics of vortex rings were understood by the end of the 1980s, and with computer advancement in the 1990s, more complex ideas could be explored. </s>
</p>
<p n="p20.141">
<s n="s1.8;p20.141">Much of the previous work on vortex rings is either based on experimental data or numerical modelling. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p20.141">However, there seems to be a lack in a combination of the two. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p20.141">This may be due to the fact that in order to do this, a specialisation in both computer and practical techniques would be needed. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p20.141">It is important to draw on both models and real-life tests because an effective computer model represents a fairly good understanding of the topic at hand. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p20.141">However, to know that it is an effective model, it should be compared to what actually happens. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p20.141">An example of this is the above Figure 4.2. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p20.141">From observation during this project, the figure can be seen to be visually fairly representative of the true situation, however there is little reference to this within Yue's paper. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p20.141">One paper that makes good use of a comparison between experimental and numerical studies is by Nitsche and Krasny, who, as stated before, produce a startlingly realistic model of the formation of a vortex ring at the end of a cylinder. </s>
</p>
<p n="p21.141">
<s n="s1.6;p21.141">Many of the experimental studies given use similar apparatus in order to do the same experiments, a piston-cylinder-nozzle arrangement is used. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p21.141">Glezer made an attempt to standardise this in 1988, as stated previously, by which time many of these similar experiments had been done. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p21.141">It would have seemed wise to attempt to standardise this at an earlier date. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p21.141">In Maxworthy's 1977 paper 'Some experimental studies of vortex rings', a number of different apparatus set-ups are used in different locations. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p21.141">This is explained by the statement that it a "certain unique piece of apparatus existed at each one (location) that could not be conveniently reassembled or manufactured in a common place." </s>
<s n="s6.6;p21.141">(Maxworthy, 1977) Even though this is understandable due to time and money constraints, it could have been an opportunity to standardise this apparatus, due to the relevance and scale of the reports submitted by Maxworthy. </s>

<head>11.2 Flat Plate</head>
<p n="p134.141">
<s n="s1.2;p134.141">A large number of experiments were completed which varied the distance of a wall from the piston. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p134.141">Also, an experiment was done related to wall distance that investigated the diameter of vortex rings under different piston conditions; piston velocity and piston stroke length. </s>
</p>
<p n="p135.141">
<s n="s1.2;p135.141">It was proved that as the piston velocity was increased, the diameter of the vortex rings increased at a decreasing rate, until a maximum was reached at about 30 cm/s for piston velocity. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p135.141">Likewise, as piston stroke length was increased, the diameter of the vortex rings increased at a slightly decreasing rate. </s>
</p>
<p n="p136.141">
<s n="s1.9;p136.141">It was also discovered that as that as piston velocity and piston stroke length were increased, and the subsequent ring diameter increased, the destroy length for the two closest walls, decreased. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p136.141">This happens because as the diameter of the rings increases, the distance to the wall decreases, thereby increasing the interaction between the rings and the wall. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p136.141">However, as the wall distances increase, correlation between ring diameters and destroy length decreases to a high extent. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p136.141">However, a slight negative skew can still be seen. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p136.141">In order to illustrate any correlation to a higher extent, a small calculation was done in order to find the distance between the ring core and the wall. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p136.141">This value was then plotted against destroy length. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p136.141">A large amount of correlation was seen for results for 50mm and 65mm, however this correlation decreased vastly for further away walls. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p136.141">A possible reason for this is that as the distance from the wall to the core of the ring increases, the distance that the ring has to travel before hitting the wall increases. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p136.141">Therefore, the ring may still be affected to a high extent but other mediums of ring decay will be given a greater opportunity to affect the ring movement such as the transition from laminar to turbulent. </s>
</p>
<p n="p137.141">
<s n="s1.6;p137.141">Observations of under which conditions the rings hit the wall, were drawn towards the wall, or were not affected by the wall were taken. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p137.141">It was discovered that as the wall distance increases, the number of rings hitting the wall decreases to an extent, drawing towards the wall rather than actually hitting it. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p137.141">The reason for this is because before the ring hits the wall, it decays through turbulence etc. instead, yet they would have hit the wall if they had not decayed. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p137.141">This can still be considered as the rings being affected by the wall, as it has altered their otherwise vertical motion. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p137.141">At the higher wall distances, a proportion of the rings did not appear to be affected by the wall. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p137.141">This shows that at these distances the wall does has a greatly reduced effect on the rings produced when compared to the closer wall distances. </s>
</p>
<p n="p138.141">
<s n="s1.6;p138.141">It can therefore be concluded that the tank does have a large enough diameter to be considered as an infinite distance away from the piston centre. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p138.141">When the wall is placed 135mm away from the piston centre, a significant percentage of the rings are still affected in some way by the presence of a wall. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p138.141">If the wall distance was increased any more then no rings would hit the wall, but a small number may still draw towards it to an extent. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p138.141">This therefore implies if the distance of the wall from the piston is increased further, i.e. to a distance equal to the wall of the tank, then no effect will be witnessed. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p138.141">The certainty of this conclusion could be improved greatly through further experimentation with a greater wall distance in order to check that no influence exists. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p138.141">This was not possible in this case though due to obstructions present. </s>

<p n="p139.141">
<s n="s1.2;p139.141">Due to inaccuracies within the 120mm tube experiment no significant conclusions have be drawn. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p139.141">However, the experiments would prove useful as a precursor to any additional investigations using the same apparatus, due to the fact that flaws identified can be repaired in future designs. </s>

<p n="p140.141">
<s n="s1.3;p140.141">The specification for the project has been met to a fairly high extent. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p140.141">This is due to the fact that it has provided evidence to suggest that the tank has a large enough diameter so as not to affect the movement of vortex rings produced within it. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p140.141">However, further experimentation would be needed in order to state this to a high degree of certainty. </s>
