<s n="s1.8;p1.15">Environmental law inevitably affects every citizen of the EU. The issues transcend national boundaries, for instance regarding river pollution or global warming. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p1.15">Therefore, the EU has gradually formed its own body of environmental law, "populated by a staggering array of actors and interests"<ref target="BAWE_0315d-ftnote.001"/>. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p1.15">Now, "the EC regulates the 'European environment' as a whole"<ref target="BAWE_0315d-ftnote.002"/>, using a range of legal principles such as the precautionary principle, the polluter pays principle and the integration principle. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p1.15">Yet, these have emerged out of an ad-hoc evolution, which can lead EC environmental law to be viewed as "a bundle of paradoxes"<ref target="BAWE_0315d-ftnote.003"/>. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p1.15">There is a conflict between the furtherance of the Community's economic aims and environmental protection. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p1.15">There are concerns that "the policy for the environment is primarily directed towards the completion of the internal market"<ref target="BAWE_0315d-ftnote.004"/> and cannot therefore be an autonomous area of policy-making. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p1.15">Nevertheless, Lord Clinton-Davis claims that "environmental policy has been one of the great success stories of the Union"<ref target="BAWE_0315d-ftnote.005"/>. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p1.15">This could be pre-emptive, given the feared ignorance of environmental issues amongst the new member states. </s>

<s n="s1.8;p2.15">At the outset of European integration, the priority was maintaining peace by way of economic integration and the creation of a common market. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p2.15">Thus, environmental legislation up to 1972 "mirrored the economic approach of the EEC Treaty"<ref target="BAWE_0315d-ftnote.006"/>. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p2.15">The environment was protected as a secondary and perhaps inadvertent consequence of some economic directives<ref target="BAWE_0315d-ftnote.007"/>. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p2.15">The Community's attitude to environmental protection at this time was "incidental", and "inarticulate"<ref target="BAWE_0315d-ftnote.008"/>. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p2.15">In 1972 international cooperation on environmental matters began with the UN Stockholm conference. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p2.15">This led to the Paris summit, where the Community declared that "economic expansion is not an end in itself"<ref target="BAWE_0315d-ftnote.009"/>. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p2.15">This assertion proved instrumental in the "attempt to wrest EC government out of the narrow economic sphere"<ref target="BAWE_0315d-ftnote.010"/>. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p2.15">It is essential that a credible environmental strategy is developed in conjunction with economic goals and not subsidiary to them. </s>

<head rend="italic">Approximation of laws</head>
<p n="p3.15">
<s n="s1.5;p3.15">The first EC environmental measures were founded on the approximation of laws, under Articles 94 and 308 EC. Article 94 allows measures that secure the harmonisation of laws affecting the common market, for example regarding the lead content of petrol<ref target="BAWE_0315d-ftnote.011"/>. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p3.15">The rationale is that differing environmental standards distort competition, thus jeopardising the efficacy of the common market. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p3.15">Industrialists would have to spend more in some states to meet their higher standards hence many measures are "attempts to ensure a level playing field"<ref target="BAWE_0315d-ftnote.012"/>. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p3.15">Article 308 is a residual power where it is "necessary to attain, in the course of the operation of the common market, one of the objectives of the Community"<ref target="BAWE_0315d-ftnote.013"/>, for instance the Wild Birds Directive <ref target="BAWE_0315d-ftnote.014"/>. </s>

<p n="p4.15">
<s n="s1.11;p4.15">A major turning point came following the SEA<ref target="BAWE_0315d-ftnote.015"/> in 1987, which "gave a considerable impetus to environmental legislation"<ref target="BAWE_0315d-ftnote.016"/>. </s>
<s n="s2.11;p4.15">It provided a "constitutional base"<ref target="BAWE_0315d-ftnote.017"/> for introducing environmental legislation and "the objectives of the Community's environment policy were enshrined in the Treaty"<ref target="BAWE_0315d-ftnote.018"/>. </s>
<s n="s3.11;p4.15">Most environmental legislation is now passed under article 175, whereas the harmonising procedures<ref target="BAWE_0315d-ftnote.019"/> are used in limited circumstances<ref target="BAWE_0315d-ftnote.020"/>. </s>
<s n="s4.11;p4.15">The TEU<ref target="BAWE_0315d-ftnote.021"/> added the environment to Articles 2 and 3 of the EC Treaty. </s>
<s n="s5.11;p4.15">Following TEU, decisions on the environment are made by QMV<ref target="BAWE_0315d-ftnote.022"/> coupled with co-decision, which makes the process easier and gives a more prominent role to the European Parliament and its Green MEPs. </s>
<s n="s6.11;p4.15">This represents a fundamental shift in the balance of power underpinning the legal order. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p4.15">Before, the member states could protect national environmental interests via their vetoes. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p4.15">Furthermore, TEU improved Article 2, which now refers to "a high level of protection and improvement of the quality of the environment"<ref target="BAWE_0315d-ftnote.023"/>. </s>
<s n="s9.11;p4.15">By virtue of the ToA<ref target="BAWE_0315d-ftnote.024"/>, Article 6 includes the environment, requiring environmental considerations to be integrated into every aspect of Community law and policy. </s>
<s n="s10.11;p4.15">These developments show that the EC has articulated a desire to pursue sustainable development whilst respecting the environment. </s>
<s n="s11.11;p4.15">Nonetheless, the SEA was something of a "tacit bargain"<ref target="BAWE_0315d-ftnote.025"/> between the "green troika"<ref target="BAWE_0315d-ftnote.026"/> and the environmentally lagging countries. </s>
