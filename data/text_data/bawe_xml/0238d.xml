<p n="p1.11">
<s n="s1.9;p1.11">Schacter's study of affiliation has suggested that all human beings need the company of others. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p1.11">We are sociable animals and therefore need to have interpersonal relationships. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p1.11">These relationships can range from romantic to casual friendships. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p1.11">However the topic most investigated by psychologists is romantic relationships, as nearly all human beings strive to achieve this relationship. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p1.11">Several theories have been suggested as to why human beings are attracted to others essentially the origins of affiliation. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p1.11">An evolutionary theory would suggest that it is a way of preserving ourselves, as we find safety and comfort in the presence of others. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p1.11">Or that we simply wish to ensure that our genes are passed on in the form of our offspring. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p1.11">Other theories suggest that we are attracted to other human beings simply by factors such as similarity or physical attractiveness. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p1.11">Although that in itself has been suggested to indicate 'good genes' by evolutionary psychologists. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.11">
<s n="s1.9;p2.11">How physical attractive someone is, is considered to be one of the first things we notice about a person. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p2.11">If a woman's face is seen to resemble that of a young child she is thought of as attractive. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p2.11">Essentially if she has large eyes a small nose and chin. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p2.11">Men are considered attractive if they possess a square jaw, small eyes and thin lips. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p2.11">As Cunningham suggested that this indicated maturity, Eysenck (2001). </s>
<s n="s6.9;p2.11">The 'halo effect' suggests that we form our total impression of a person from this one outstanding trait. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p2.11">We associate physical beauty with goodness, and physical attraction with beauty. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p2.11">Bringham in 1971 suggested that men and women both agree that physically attractive people are thought of as poised, sociable, interesting, independent, exciting and sexually warm, Eysenck (2001). </s>
<s n="s9.9;p2.11">Also physically attractive children are thought of as better behaved and considered more intelligent. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.11">
<s n="s1.12;p3.11">The 'matching hypothesis' though suggests that we do not seek the most physically attractive person. </s>
<s n="s2.12;p3.11">Instead we search for someone who is similar to ourselves in physical attractiveness. </s>
<s n="s3.12;p3.11">We seek this compromise as we have a fear of rejection from someone who more physically attractive than ourselves. </s>
<s n="s4.12;p3.11">In 1966 Walster conducted an experiment in which he found that the hypothesis was disproved. </s>
<s n="s5.12;p3.11">Students were asked to rate partners who had been randomly selected. </s>
<s n="s6.12;p3.11">It was found that students preferred partners who were more physically attractive not someone who matched them, Atkinson (2000). </s>
<s n="s7.12;p3.11">However three years later Walster and Walster repeated the experiment but this time the students met beforehand. </s>
<s n="s8.12;p3.11">This time it was found that there was a greater likeness for similar attractiveness. </s>
<s n="s9.12;p3.11">This was possibly because they had more time to think about the qualities they wanted in a partner, and had had enough time to be able to look past how attractive the person was, Eysenk (2001). </s>
<s n="s10.12;p3.11">The theory that similarly attractive people attract was supported by Murstein's research in 1972, Eysenk (2001). </s>
<s n="s11.12;p3.11">He showed pictures of couples and engaged couples and asked people to judge them in terms of physical attractiveness. </s>
<s n="s12.12;p3.11">He found that there was a tendency for the couples to be rated in terms of similar attractiveness. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.11">
<s n="s1.8;p4.11">Similarity in attitude is also another factor that has been suggested as why we are attracted to other human beings. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p4.11">In 1961 Newcomb found that 58% of people who shared similar attitudes and lived together were more likely to develop a friendship, Atkinson (2000). </s>
<s n="s3.8;p4.11">In contrast to 25% likelihood of people who had different attitudes forming a friendship. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p4.11">Therefore it does seem to be an important factor in determining interpersonal attraction. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p4.11">However Bryne in 1968 suggested that attitude similarity had more of an effect on interpersonal attraction when the attitudes themselves were of importance, Eysenk (2001). </s>
<s n="s6.8;p4.11">If a certain attitude were important to an individual it would be the similarity between the two people on this topic that would be of most importance concerning attraction. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p4.11">Bryne did a further laboratory study in 1971, where participants had to complete an attitude questionnaire and then later make judgements about another person about whom attitudes are shown. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p4.11">He found we tend to like those with similar attitudes and tend to dislike those with dissimilar. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.11">
<s n="s1.7;p5.11">Similarity seems to be valued very highly in what is attractive about fellow human beings, as similarity in personality is also considered an important factor. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p5.11">In 1958 Winch argued that married couples will be happier if they each have complementary needs, so a domineering husband and submissive wife would be well suited, Eysenk (2001). </s>
<s n="s3.7;p5.11">However most evidence indicates that similarity of personality is important. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p5.11">Burgess and Wallin in 1953 studied 1000 engaged couples with reference to 42 personality traits, Eysenk (2001). </s>
<s n="s5.7;p5.11">Finding there was significant within couple similarity concerning at least 14 of the personality characteristics. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p5.11">However when considering interpersonal attraction individual differences must be considered. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p5.11">As some people attach more significance than others to physical attractiveness, personality and attitude. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.11">
<s n="s1.21;p6.11">The evolutionary theory suggests that our behaviour must be adaptive otherwise individuals would not have lived long enough to pass them on to their offspring. </s>
<s n="s2.21;p6.11">Our social behaviour towards relationships has been developed over thousands of years, as it has been the most successful at producing offspring. </s>
<s n="s3.21;p6.11">Males and Females both seek sexual partners who are most likely to produce healthy children. </s>
<s n="s4.21;p6.11">This could explain why physically healthy partners are generally preferred to unhealthy ones. </s>
<s n="s5.21;p6.11">Also men tend to prefer women who are younger than them because younger women are more likely to be fertile. </s>
<s n="s6.21;p6.11">In 1930 Fisher devised a hypothesis entitled the 'runaway process'. </s>
<s n="s7.21;p6.11">Stating that females are initially attracted to the features of a male that have survival value. </s>
<s n="s8.21;p6.11">This is also described as the 'sexy sons' hypothesis, Eysenk (2001). </s>
<s n="s9.21;p6.11">The female looks for a physically attractive male, as firstly their desirable characteristics will be passed on to the son. </s>
<s n="s10.21;p6.11">Therefore his reproductive chances will be enhanced thus the mother's genes are perpetuated. </s>
<s n="s11.21;p6.11">Females it has been suggested also select mates on the basis of non-inherited characteristics, most especially their possession of resources. </s>
<s n="s12.21;p6.11">This is because for women there is a large investment being put it when it comes to having children. </s>
<s n="s13.21;p6.11">Therefore they look for a good investment, which in terms of a partner means having good resources. </s>
<s n="s14.21;p6.11">So he will be able to provide for her and her child. </s>
<s n="s15.21;p6.11">Buss's cross-cultural study in 1989 suggests both men and women follow the same patterns of behaviour as predicted by the evolutionary theory when searching for a partner. </s>
<s n="s16.21;p6.11">Finding that men look for women younger than themselves and women for men older than themselves. </s>
<s n="s17.21;p6.11">This is because younger women are more fertile and older men are more likely to have obtained greater resources. </s>
<s n="s18.21;p6.11">Davis's study in 1990 on the contents of personal advertisements gives further weight to the evolutionary theory. </s>
<s n="s19.21;p6.11">He found women more often than not advertised their physical beauty, whilst men emphasised their wealth or other resources. </s>
<s n="s20.21;p6.11">However the notion that romantic relationships have reproduction as their primary goal does not apply to all romantic relationships. </s>
<s n="s21.21;p6.11">He does not account for homosexual relationships or heterosexual relationships in which there is no intention to have children. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.11">
<s n="s1.5;p7.11">There is also the Propinquity Effect, which concerns the attraction of other human beings, we tend to like those we find ourselves near and whom we tend to interact. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p7.11">Kerckhoff reports of the Nashville study in which couples within the area applying for a marriage license had there separate addresses measured in miles apart from each other. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p7.11">61.6% of couples lived within 20 blocks of each other, Kerckhoff (1956). </s>
<s n="s4.5;p7.11">Festinger, Schacter and Back in 1950 found much the same when studying residents in a new housing project. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p7.11">41% named their next-door neighbour as their best friend, 2% two doors away and 10% three doors away. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.11">
<s n="s1.9;p8.11">The attraction of other human beings is that we need human contact. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p8.11">If we are isolated we become fearful and we find comfort and safety in other people. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p8.11">Physical attractiveness seems to play an important role in what attracts us to a specific person. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p8.11">It seems that we are more likely to associate good values upon a physically attractive person than someone less so. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p8.11">Whilst similarity seems too more important in developing an attraction with someone. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p8.11">Whilst the evolutionary theory can be disproved as it does not apply to homosexual relationships and childless marriages. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p8.11">It does however give explanation to certain types of social behaviour towards relationships. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p8.11">Why men tend to prefer younger women and why women prefer older men. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p8.11">However why one person is attracted to another is always going to be hard to explain, as it is such an individual thing. </s>
