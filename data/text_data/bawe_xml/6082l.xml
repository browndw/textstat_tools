<p n="p29.34">
<s n="s1.1;p29.34">The methodology and apparatus used show a fairly high degree of accuracy (with difference of results within Â± 0.05cm <hi rend="sup">3</hi>) and minor sources of errors. </s>
</p>
<p n="p30.34">
<s n="s1.4;p30.34">The main source of error is probably the personal judgement with naked eyes of <hi rend="underlined">end point</hi> (also see p. ) - the solution in conical flask changes from colourless to the first permanent pale pink by one-drop addition, which is always difficult to control, from the run down of KMnO <hi rend="sub">4</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p30.34">On the other hand, the consistency of pink colour can be obtained quantitatively by measuring absorbencies of solution in the conical flask after each titration. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p30.34">An accurate photospectrometer set at an appropriate wavelength can be used. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p30.34">It is expected that the higher the absorbance value the higher the pink intensity, thus a positive correlation. </s>
</p>
<p n="p31.34">
<s n="s1.6;p31.34">The second major source of error could be <hi rend="underlined">transfers</hi> of solutions, thus it is practically hard to not lose any tablets contents. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p31.34">After transfers, the wet surfaces of containers sufficiently mean some loss of iron. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p31.34">Ideally, the number of transfers and apparatus should be kept at minimum. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p31.34">The mortar can be used in weighing as well as grinding iron tablets. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p31.34">The number of transfers is therefore reduced by not using a weighing boat. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p31.34">It is however good to have rinsed the apparatus after transfers. </s>
</p>
<p n="p32.34">
<s n="s1.5;p32.34">It is preferred to vortex the solution of Fe and H <hi rend="sub">2</hi>SO <hi rend="sub">4</hi> to ensure it is "thoroughly mixed" and to avoid "undissloved solid" in the flask. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p32.34">A shaking time could also be set. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p32.34">It is important to keep the consistency: A clean dry conical flask should be used for each titration. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p32.34">It is crucial to keep the burette straight, parallel to the clamp stand and perpendicular to the bench, when reading the burette volumes. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p32.34">A piece of white paper can be cut and placed behind the burette of dark purple KMnO <hi rend="sub">4</hi>, for easier burette volumes readings. </s>
</p>
<p n="p33.34">
<s n="s1.4;p33.34">The Fe tablets are weighed <hi rend="italic">accurately</hi> by using four-decimal-place electronic scale, in order to obtain more reliable and valid results. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p33.34">It is good laboratory practice to have rinsed the weighing boat, pestle, mortar and the funnel after each transfer, and then the washings were added to the flask. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p33.34">Other accurate apparatus is used e.g. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p33.34">100cm <hi rend="sup">3</hi> Graduated flask and 50cm <hi rend="sup">3</hi>-burette (calibrated to Â±0.05cm <hi rend="sup">3</hi>). </s>

<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">Conclusion</head>
<p n="p34.34">
<s n="s1.3;p34.34">From 2.4 Calculations and 2.5 Questions (p. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p34.34">4 &amp; 5), the percentage of iron in iron(II) Sulphate tablets has been estimated as16.3%, which is approximately half of the claimed content (32.5%) by the manufacturer. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p34.34">This practical has helped to further familiarised with the titration techniques. </s>
