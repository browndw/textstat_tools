<p n="p3.39">
<s n="s1.4;p3.39">This essay will make a critical account of the responses given by IR theory to the above type of questions, responses that have usually revolved around dichotomies such as realism versus idealism or communitarianism versus liberalism and cosmopolitanism. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p3.39">On the one hand, universalism and cosmopolitanism have been accused of giving insufficient consideration to moral pluralism and diversity, neglecting local or national identity for the sake of a supposedly transcendent moral universal truth or ideal that may actually reflect the Western European historical tradition. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p3.39">On the other hand, realism has been criticised as overlooking the interdependent fate of human beings and their equal worth as moral subjects. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p3.39">Similarly, communitarianism has been accused of over-emphasising the moral priority of the community over the individual, arguing for an embedded self, which is considered by liberals as a constraint upon human freedom. </s>

<s n="s3.4;p4.39">The essay will show how the IR responses have tried to prove the prevalence of one perspective, generally neglecting the degrees of overlap between the two allegedly opposing standpoints. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p4.39">It will argue that if reconciliation between the two perspectives is looked for, then the first step to be made is to admit the relevant truths in both since an either/or approach is sterile. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p5.39">Firstly this essay will focus on the 'responses' offered by communitarianism, realism and cosmopolitanism to the dilemma of moral pluralism and universalism. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p5.39">Moral pluralism refers in this essay to the existence of a plurality of world-views, which are said to be contextual and contingent giving birth to certain ways of life, behaviours and public cultures, which significantly differ from one community to another. </s>

<s n="s4.5;p5.39">Rights are ranked differently in different places. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p5.39">For instance, the idea of human rights seems incompatible with East Asian values since the virtue of personal autonomy, which underpins it, is not a basic virtue there.<ref target="BAWE_0195e-ftnote.001"/> As Linklater mentions, "human subjects cannot perceive the world other than through the distorting lens of language and culture which has already made them what they are as moral subjects". <ref target="BAWE_0195e-ftnote.002"/> </s>

<s n="s1.3;p6.39">However, all these incommensurable paradigms form and complete the truth about humanity since, as universalism highlights, certain moral universal standards exist and ought to be respected irrespective of community, nation, state or territory, their culture and morality. </s>
