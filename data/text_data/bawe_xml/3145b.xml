<s n="s1.6;p7.20">Several criticisms have been raised in response to Augustine's theodicy. </s>

<s n="s3.6;p7.20">The conception of an unqualifiedly good creature committing sin is incomprehensible, if angels are finitely perfect they will never sin despite being free to do so, if they do sin they cannot have been flawless implying that God as their creator must share responsibility for their Fall. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p7.20">It has been argued that the emphasis on the Fall and the self creation of evil 'ex nihilo' is conflicting as if God created a perfect world it is not evident how evil could arise, however I do not find this to weaken the theodicy as Augustine does not maintain that evil is created "ex nihilo" rather that it is not created at all as it is a lack of something not an entity in itself. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p7.20">As Hell is considered to be part of God's initial design then he must have anticipated that the world would corrupt. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p7.20">Scientific advancement has also hindered the Augustinian theodicy as it would appear due to evolution that humans are in fact striving towards perfection, not away from it. </s>

<s n="s1.9;p8.20">Weaknesses of the Irenaean theodicy have also been identified. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p8.20">Flew and Mackie<ref target="BAWE_3145b-ftnote.011"/> (1982) are successful in criticising the theodicy as they argue that humans with the same degree of freedom vary in their ability to sin, therefore God could have made humans so that they always freely choose what is right. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p8.20">They give the example of a saint and a depraved human, it is logically possible for the saint to sin but morally impossible, similarly it is logically possible for the depraved human to not sin but morally impossible. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p8.20">God could have created perfect humans that were free to sin but remained sinless. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p8.20">Smart (1970) retaliates by criticising what he referred to as the 'Utopia thesis' as concepts e.g. good are linked to other concepts e.g. courage, temptation etc. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p8.20">The perception of goodness would be meaningless if there were no experiences of temptation and no circumstance for one to choose good above evil - a morally untemptable being could not be thought of as good. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p8.20">I do not find this to overcome Flew and Mackie's criticism as they suggesting the creation of beings that still experience temptation but are sufficiently more resilient to it, not beings that experience no temptation at all. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p8.20">Even if one accepts evil as the result of free will being misused, this only accounts for moral evil and does not provide explanation for the existence of natural evil<ref target="BAWE_3145b-ftnote.012"/>. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p8.20">In addition to this criticism the proposition of heaven for all individuals regardless of their actions seems unjust and the extreme amount of suffering is unacceptable and unnecessary for humans to become like God. </s>

<s n="s5.7;p9.20">This could lead to inaction and indifference towards others' suffering. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p9.20">Hick's theodicy does not account for those who die young as they do not have the chance to overcome suffering and develop morally<ref target="BAWE_3145b-ftnote.014"/>, the theodicy also fails to account for the unequal distribution of suffering as some people experience minimal suffering therefore nothing challenges them to undergo moral growth. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p16.20">I found this website to be helpful with regard to the problem of evil as it provided a comprehensive account of the problem evil poses for the existence of God. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p16.20">The contents of the document were clearly stated which made it very easy to find the information that was relevant to me as much of the webpage addressed aspects of the problem of evil that I did not include in my essay. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p16.20">This website was most useful for criticising Hick's 'soul-making' theodicy as a variety of criticisms were presented. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p16.20">Once again because this source was a website I was reluctant to use information that could not be confirmed by my other sources in case it was unreliable. </s>

<p n="p17.20">
<s n="s1.7;p17.20">This book was incredibly useful as it outlined the main arguments for the problem of evil clearly and concisely. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p17.20">Vardy examined what evil is and defined the problem of evil. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p17.20">This book was particularly helpful in criticising the free will defence. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p17.20">Vardy rejects evil being viewed as a greater good. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p17.20">He refers to both natural and moral evil which was helpful as a lot of books only focus on moral evil. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p17.20">It is evident that Vardy believes in the existence of God in spite of the problem of evil, yet he does not believe that the arguments raised in response to evil are successful in overcoming it. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p17.20">The main drawback to "The Puzzle of Evil" is that it was difficult to identify the main points to include as due to the word limit of the essay I could not include all of the arguments/criticisms that were presented. </s>
