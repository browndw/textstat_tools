<s n="s2.2;p6.13">The bacteria that are not discoloured are called 'acid-fast', and are <hi rend="italic">Mycobacteria</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Actinomycetes</hi>, which contain a waxy cell envelope preventing the penetration of most stains. </s>

<s n="s3.4;p7.13">After this counter stain, acid-fast organisms are red and the others are blue. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p7.13">This stain is common to Gram staining, in that carbol fuchsin will not easily rinse away in positive cells, an acid alcohol is used as decolouriser, and the counterstain is methylene blue, which, as mentioned above, is sometimes used to replace crystal violet in Gram staining. </s>

<s n="s2.2;p9.13">Spores can resist many adverse environmental conditions, and their identification is very important in analysing body fluid or tissue because only a few genera produce spores such as <hi rend="italic">Bacillus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Clostridium</hi>, which together cause a number of diseases such as botulism, tetanus, anthrax, and gangrene. </s>
