<s n="s2.9;p1.17">The essay will begin by giving a definition of the 'European Commissions'<ref target="BAWE_0355a-ftnote.002"/> Leniency Notice and Cartels followed by a concise discussion of the difficulty of detecting and proving the existence of a cartel which consumers must view in light of the 'leniency notice'<ref target="BAWE_0355a-ftnote.003"/>. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p1.17">The essay will attempt to address the issues derived from the policy objectives of imposing penalties on those individuals who commit an offence but in effect are not penalised. </s>

<s n="s5.9;p1.17">The Commissions notice was firstly introduced in 1996. </s>

<s n="s8.9;p1.17">Nevertheless, despite its limitations its successes so far are promising and undeniably models as a weapon for the beginning of the destruction of cartels. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p1.17">The essay will conclude that the operation of the notice may still have to be improved before it can be as successful as the US notice. </s>

<s n="s6.10;p2.17">However, cartels are fissile in nature. </s>

<s n="s2.12;p3.17">Despite this, retributive concerns have arisen in regard to the operation of the notice. </s>
<s n="s3.12;p3.17">This is because the notice 'compromises some core values of criminal and penal jurisprudence, by excusing and rewarding a major offender'<ref target="BAWE_0355a-ftnote.014"/> in a cartel. </s>
<s n="s4.12;p3.17">Therefore, the notice may be seen as a social and criminal limitation as a whole. </s>
<s n="s5.12;p3.17">However, this limitation can be justified in light of the following argument. </s>
<s n="s6.12;p3.17">The notice is 'not...available to a cartel member who...coerced other members of the cartel." </s>

<s n="s9.12;p3.17">Further, in violations like cartels there will be several parties involved therefore, 'even though one party gets off, there will be others to prosecute, and their prosecutions will be more certain." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0355a-ftnote.018"/>
<s n="s10.12;p3.17">This means that the policy objectives of imposing penalties on those individuals who have committed an offence and should be punished are not compromised so that cartel practices are detected and brought to an end. </s>

<p n="p5.17">
<s n="s1.13;p5.17">The absence of criminal liability is one of the limitations of the EU competition law, which in turn adversely affects the operation of the notice. </s>
<s n="s2.13;p5.17">This can be explained in terms of the fact that, immunity from criminal sanctions provide more of an incentive for an individual or a corporation in a cartel to come forward and win the race to the courtroom door. </s>
<s n="s3.13;p5.17">This may be because 'businessmen do not like being labeled as criminals'<ref target="BAWE_0355a-ftnote.023"/> thereby risking their reputation and the implications of a criminal record. </s>
<s n="s4.13;p5.17">Therefore, criminal liability creates fear and acts as a severe sanction for cartel activity, which in turn enforces the use of the notice. </s>
<s n="s5.13;p5.17">The US notice is an example of this as it has continued to be successful because 'it benefits from its location in a context of criminal justice." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0355a-ftnote.024"/>
<s n="s6.13;p5.17">In turn, the EC notice must provide the same equivalent version of this severe penalty in order to provide a foundation for the effective use of the notice. </s>
<s n="s7.13;p5.17">This is created in the form of imposing high fines for cartel activity, which the commission has been doing. </s>
<s n="s8.13;p5.17">There is no doubt that high fines deter companies from entering into a cartel and creates a strong incentive for companies to take advantage of the notice by gaining immunity. </s>
<s n="s9.13;p5.17">However, despite this, firms may still find ways of compensating these fines for example, 'passing fines on to customers in the form of higher prices, companies can indemnify individuals." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0355a-ftnote.025"/>
<s n="s10.13;p5.17">In contrast 'a prison sentence cannot be compensated by any means." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0355a-ftnote.026"/>
<s n="s11.13;p5.17">Thus, the penalty of high fines may not be enough of a serious sanction to deter individuals from engaging in cartel activity as 'a jurisdiction without...criminal sanctions will never be as effective at inducing amnesty applications as a program that does." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0355a-ftnote.027"/>
<s n="s12.13;p5.17">Hence, this acts as a potentially very important limitation of the effect that the lack of criminal sanctions has on the operation of the notice. </s>

<s n="s15.21;p12.17">This in turn reduces the 'higher burden akin to the EU notice to secure first place in line for immunity.<ref target="BAWE_0355a-ftnote.076"/> Further, the US notice 'is inherently transparent because they 'have eliminated, to a great extent, the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in its application'<ref target="BAWE_0355a-ftnote.077"/> because each company knows that if they are the first to submit evidence they will receive immunity, and they can also use the marker process, to their benefit, to ensure that they mark their place in the line. </s>
<s n="s16.21;p12.17">Therefore, the DOJ cannot use their own discretion to state which company should be prosecuted and which should have immunity. </s>
<s n="s17.21;p12.17">This strengthens the transparency of the US notice. </s>
<s n="s18.21;p12.17">In turn, the lack of a marker system in the EC notice may deter prospective applicants and most importantly 'such a barrier to reporting quickly is also counter to the aims of an immunity system that is meant to encourage companies to race to confess once infringements are found." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0355a-ftnote.078"/>
<s n="s19.21;p12.17">Therefore, it seems that a similar process as in the US for a marker system may need to be adopted in order to improve and strengthen the certainty, transparency and predictability of the operation of the notice. </s>
<s n="s20.21;p12.17">However, as apart of the notice possible future revision 'a marker-style system for applying for immunity is being seriously considered'<ref target="BAWE_0355a-ftnote.079"/> by the commission. </s>
<s n="s21.21;p12.17">The dawn raid test may also need to be explicitly defined; this would in turn reduce the discretionary nature of the term and may improve the predictability of the notice for a prospective undertaking. </s>

<head rend="underlined">Conclusion</head>
<p n="p17.17">
<s n="s1.8;p17.17">The notice is effective as it addresses the difficulty of detecting and proving the existence of a cartel and also the retributive concerns surrounding leniency for cartel offenders. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p17.17">It has been successful since its introduction in 1996 as it has resulted in a number of cartels being detected. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p17.17">The limitations of the notice such as the lack of criminal sanctions, amnesty plus, a marker system and the fact that a cartel member may be liable to civil and criminal proceedings in member states and the continuous lack of transparency and certainty may reduce the effectiveness of the operation of the notice within the EU. Moreover these limitations fall into the three prerequisites needed to create a successful leniency notice, namely severe sanctions, heightened fear of detection, and transparency. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p17.17">Thus, it is likely that the EC notice may not as yet emulate the successes of the US notice until certain improvements have been made. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p17.17">The improvements consists of the introduction of criminal sanctions for cartel behaviour, the addition of amnesty plus and a marker system, the issues of confidentiality and the vagueness of the meaning of the dawn raid test are addressed and lastly if the member states are willing to align their laws with the ECN Model Leniency programme. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p17.17">However, it must be noted that the notice is a recent reform which needs time to develop as the US notice has had time to develop. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p17.17">In time the notice will create success stories like that of the US as long as it continues to improve on its limitations. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p17.17">The commission is no doubt working to achieve this objective, and this is reflected through the 'draft Commission Notice on Immunity from fines' and the introduction of the ECN model Law. </s>
