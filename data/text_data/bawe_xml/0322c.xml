<ref target="BAWE_0322c-ftnote.001"/>
<s n="s3.6;p1.34">In order to form any discussion comparing two such outstanding personalities as Martin Luther King, Jr. and Fidel Castro Ruz, the subject of charisma is always liable to play an important role. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p1.34">However, these two characters, whose careers catapulted them to the forefront of public observation at almost the same time but in entirely different contexts, offer more than just an intriguing public persona. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p1.34">This discussion aims at highlighting outstanding comparable themes, themes based on the characters more so than the careers of these two men. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p1.34">Due to the untimely death of Martin Luther King, Jr. in 1968, a fair comparison restricts the majority of the discussion to focus upon an acute time period between about 1953 and 1970. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p2.34">The discussion will begin by giving a brief summary of the social and political environments in which King and Castro's careers would take part, followed by a short summary of the careers themselves. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p2.34">This serves simply to set the tone for the thematic study, to give the reader a context allowing for an understanding of the situation that King and Castro must work within and should not be taken as a strict comparison. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p2.34">The main body of the discussion focuses on select themes that allow for either a similar or contrasting comparison. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p2.34">Such themes include young lives, oratory and the use of propaganda medium, relationship with US political institutions and Communism, attitude toward the use of violence, and the level of control exercised by the two men over their respective following and organisations. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.34">
<s n="s1.2;p3.34">One obvious but nonetheless major point to address regarding social change, in this comparison, is that Fidel Castro became the ruling body in Cuba following his revolution, taking political power after rising from below to affect social change from above. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p3.34">Martin Luther King had no political agenda for himself instead aiming to affect social change from below, with among others, lobbying tactics and direct action campaigns. </s>

<p n="p4.34">
<s n="s1.11;p4.34">Following Cuban independence from Spain in 1898, the country had been run by various administrative bodies who shared one common objective; to maintain the economy through reliance on the United States. </s>

<s n="s5.11;p4.34">Under Dr. Grau San Martin, the revolutionaries could only hold power for one hundred days due to US pressure, and Felguncio Batista, who had assisted the 1933 take over, defected, forcing Grau to resign. </s>
<s n="s6.11;p4.34">For the next eighteen years, Batista puppets, Batista himself, Grau San Martin and Carlos Prio served as Presidents, the latter two gaining office without their old revolutionary intent. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p4.34">Batista then seized power in 1952, ruling as dictator until 1959 when Fidel Castro's revolutionary guerrillas took power. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p4.34">Politically, all administrations had proved corrupt. </s>
<s n="s9.11;p4.34">Under Batista, Cuba saw an increased injection of US capital, fuelling nationalist resentment. </s>
<s n="s10.11;p4.34">In truth however, the non-Batista governing bodies before 1952 had proved corrupt and ineffective. </s>
<s n="s11.11;p4.34">After 1952 Batista was able to bring political stability to the island, but over reliance on US capital and poor organisation eroded the economy. </s>

<s n="s2.11;p5.34">Following his failed attack on the Moncada army barracks of 1953, Castro was sent to jail. </s>
<s n="s3.11;p5.34">Upon early release, he fled to Mexico, forming a revolutionary grouped who then travelled back to Cuba in 1956 aboard their purchased yacht, Granma. </s>
<s n="s4.11;p5.34">His eighty-two man landing party were all but crushed by the Batista regime, but Castro survived and eventually regrouped, gaining support from local peasantry, and others fighting a nationalist cause. </s>

<s n="s7.11;p5.34">His Communist Party of Cuba was established as the main ruling body of the island in 1965 and despite promises of a return to democratic institutionalisation during his time in the mountains; Fidel proclaimed that the old style bourgeois democracy would only corrupt the country. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p6.34">As previously noted, Martin Luther King had no desire for political power. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p6.34">During his career as a civil rights campaigner, King's intention was to force the issue of social justice upon the current political administration, primarily through the use of direct action. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p6.34">An abundance of social injustice existed in the United States throughout the first half of the twentieth century, injustice resulting from an ever expanding gulf in class relations and social acceptance. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p6.34">One particular group would find social acceptance particularly hard to attain; the black population of America, who made up approximately ten-percent of the nation. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p6.34">Race relations, especially in the deeper Southern states of the US, had suffered greatly since the turn of the century, as white supremacists maintained a hard-line racist stance, a stance that dated back generations to a time when southern whites owned blacks as slaves. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p6.34">The Emancipation Proclamation and resultant 14 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 15 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> amendments to the constitution that followed by 1870, had designated that <hi rend="italic">all persons</hi> born in the United States would receive equal protection of the laws and voting rights. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p7.34">King's careers as a Baptist Preacher began in earnest when he became pastor of Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in 1954. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p7.34">However, Montgomery would catapult King into the public eye only a year later. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p7.34">He declared that the Negro was realising at last that he was <hi rend="italic">somebody</hi>, and in 1955-56, the black community of Montgomery proved his proclamation right. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p7.34">Rosa Parks, a soft-spoken black woman refused to vacate her seat on a bus as was customary, so that a white man could sit in her place. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p7.34">Following her arrest, black leaders in the city, including King, decided to set up a permanent organisation to run a bus boycott and handle other racial difficulties. espite his initial reluctance, elected President of the MIA, a post guaranteeing him personal responsibility for mobilising support for the boycott itself and thus beginning his career as a prominent civil rights campaigner. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p7.34">His first years as a civil rights campaigner would prove difficult as President Eisenhower won a second term in office, owing to increased Southern support following his reluctance to enforce desegregation. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.34">
<s n="s1.9;p8.34">On many occasions throughout King's career, concessions were not made in their entirety by white supremacists and Southern state representatives despite boycott and direct action campaigns. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p8.34">Despite this, King was able to bring the civil rights campaign under the scrutiny of the public, using the media to his advantage in such respects. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p8.34">Accepting the Presidency of the newly formed SCLC in 1957, King embarked upon ten years of non-violent action campaigns, generally focussed on the South. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p8.34">Following his successful Birmingham campaign he led a march to Washington, delivering his most memorable speech to an enormous live and television audience. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p8.34">Subsequent President's John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson showed greater promise in the civil rights field, both conversing with King during his career regarding such matters as voting rights, and under Johnson a voting rights bill passed was signed in 1965. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p8.34">In the eyes of black militants however, King's non-violent action never really achieved enough. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p8.34">King decided to personally condemn Johnson and the war in Vietnam, a war that he believed kept vital resources from the President's supposed 'War on Poverty.' </s>
<s n="s8.9;p8.34">Unfortunately for King, his outspoken comments alienated many followers, and his movement began to stutter, at a time when 'black power' was emerging as a more desirable alternative. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p8.34">King's movement was undoubtedly faltering by the time of his death on 4 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> April 1968, but his commitment to the cause and substantial effort toward the achievement of the gains of the civil rights movement cannot be questioned. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.34">
<s n="s1.3;p9.34">In order to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the personalities of King and Castro, it is of great importance to establish brief accounts of events and personalities that played a role during the younger years of the two men's lives. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p9.34">A personality itself can begin to form through the teachings and inspirations received at developing stages of younger life. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p9.34">Experiences can have both positive and detrimental affects on the developing mind-set of an individual, the two most important experiences at a younger age being parentage and education. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.34">
<s n="s1.6;p10.34">In the case of Fidel Castro, perhaps we must look no further, in determining the evolution of his personality, than the relationship he shared with his father, which according to historian Lowry Nelson, was not close. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p10.34">He resented the fact that 'his father exploited the peasants on his plantation and paid no taxes on his land or income." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0322c-ftnote.006"/>
<s n="s3.6;p10.34">Incidentally, part of his main support base as a revolutionary would come from the peasantry. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p10.34">The very nature of his family's well-to-do status would never sit well with Fidel, a man who, as <hi rend="italic">líder máximo,</hi> would harbour resentful ideological feelings about such a class. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p10.34">Fidel's resentment toward his father, regarding the mistreatment of sugarcane workers, boiled over to such an extent that, at the age of just thirteen, he staged an insurrection aimed at organising the workers into a strike. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p10.34">This episode serves as a great indicator for the progression of Fidel's revolutionary mentality. </s>

<s n="s3.5;p12.34">Castro would actively participate in off-campus revolutionary activities as university life developed a revolutionary environment of its own, complete with violent incursions and coercive riots. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p12.34">In a similar way to Martin Luther King, Fidel's oratory skills would develop at university as he took the role as vice-president of the student organisation of the law school. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p12.34">In his earlier days, as a college student, Fidel even gained experience as a hiker in the Sierra Maestra range, the very mountains that nearly twenty years later would play such an important role in his life as the emergent leader of 'The Revolution'. </s>

<p n="p13.34">
<s n="s1.4;p13.34">In a similar fashion to that of Castro, we can form a brief evaluation of Martin Luther King's younger life by looking at his upbringing and education. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p13.34">King was born into a well-off family, not to unlike Fidel Castro in that respect, but in a completely different context, as race played as much, if not greater a role, than class in twentieth century America. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p13.34">Born to a Baptist preacher in Atlanta, Georgia, King did not resent his well-to-do upbringing like Castro, rebelling far less than Fidel and receiving painful punishment on the rare occasions he did. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p13.34">Kings father, who named both himself and his son Martin Luther King following a name change, desired that Martin would become a Baptist preacher and so Martin was encouraged from an early age to speak confidently, a skill that would mature at an alarming rate and develop into an outstanding virtue. </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.34">
<s n="s1.3;p14.34">King matched, and perhaps even surpassed the Castro intellect and desire to learn. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p14.34">Predominantly enjoying and following a theologically based line of teaching, King studied under many a professor and read and developed understanding of the writings of many theologians and philosophers. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p14.34">Beginning his educational career at Morehouse College, King then graduated to Crozer Theological Seminary near Philadelphia before embarking upon a doctoral study at Boston University. </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.34">
<s n="s1.6;p15.34">During his short civil rights career, one talent stands out above all others, the ability to orate to an exited, expectant and anticipant crowd. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p15.34">King's ability to speak confidently increased rapidly as he took part in oration contests on more than one occasion during his education. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p15.34">As a confident speaker he was able to make friends easily, impressing many lady friends as well, especially in the north where a racist attitude did not predominate. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p15.34">Ordained as his father's assistant at Ebenezer Baptist church in 1948, three years before he attended Boston, King had proven his ability as a very promising preacher at just seventeen. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p15.34">His trial sermon was a 'resounding success' as his father said "crowds kept coming, and we had to move to the main auditorium." </s>

<s n="s1.4;p16.34">A more detailed social representation of the United States during King's unbringing has been noted above, but by far the more outstanding feature of society to receive King's focus and devotion was that of social and especially racial injustice. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p16.34">During summer breaks from Morehouse, King became all the more aware of the abundant existence of racism. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p16.34">However, an important stage in his young life came when he served on an interracial group and, with a more apologetic, understanding, and cooperative attitude than was normal for a black man, decided to blame racism on the system. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p16.34">King believed that white supremacist attitudes were a product of environment and history, and this attitude helped to shape King's developing non-violent attitude. </s>
</p>
<p n="p17.34">
<s n="s1.3;p17.34">Another factor regarding his non-violent approach stemmed from the readings and role-model status King gave to men whom he understood and believed answered many of his questions as an academic. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p17.34">To a certain extent, Fidel Castro similarly reserved a certain amount of adoration for revolutionary role-model José Martí. </s>

<s n="s3.7;p18.34">However, these two agree categorically along one theme; oratory. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p18.34">Oates' biography itself is much more explicit than Lings' as it attempts to paint a far more positive portrait of King, but examples of King's oratorical abilities can not escape the attentions of either of these authors or indeed anyone formulating a serious discussion regarding the civil rights campaigner. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p18.34">Similarly, Tad Szulc dedicates a section of the opening paragraph of his book "Fidel: A Critical Portrait" to the oratorical talents of the Cuban Revolutionary leader. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p18.34">Despite King and Castro's vastly different racial, ideological and social environments, perhaps the greatest, and most similar trait they possess, is the ability to speak to and captivate and audience. </s>
