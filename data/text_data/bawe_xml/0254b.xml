<s n="s1.8;p42.42">To conclude, the general design does fulfill all the specifications set to it. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p42.42">A stylus instrument has been designed which allows the users to measure the roughness average of surface, which is displayed in analogue or digital form. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p42.42">The mechanical system has been analysis and clearly defined, several parameters that affecting the dynamic characteristics of the pick-up system is discussed as well. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p42.42">In this stylus instrument, a LVDT is chosen for a transducer since it has many advantages over other displacement sensors. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p42.42">In one word, the overall system can be described as four parts: sensor, transducer, process data, and output. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p42.42">Sensor collects original information from a surface, transducer transforms it into an electrical signal, then an amplifier and a filter are used to improve the data signal during data processing. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p42.42">After that, output is represented with gauge mechanism or computer. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p42.42">Finally, surface roughness is achieved. </s>
