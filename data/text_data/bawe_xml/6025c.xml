<s n="s3.8;p2.20">Later in 1948, Swiss scientist Paul MÃ¼ller received the Noble Prize in medicine for his discovery of the insecticide property of DDT. Since then, DDT was manufactured in large quantities in the United States and Britain, during the second half of World War II. During the 1940s and 1950s, DDT was used extensively on the maintaining of hygiene and preventing epidemics of insect and acarine borne diseases, such as malaria and typhus. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p2.20">By 1958, massive spraying of DDT occurred extensively thought out Africa, Asia and South America as an insecticide to control the malaria-transmitting mosquito, <hi rend="italic">Anopheles</hi>. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p2.20">Initially, the use of DDT was very successful particularly in the control of malaria, as well as against agricultural pest. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p2.20">However, by the 1950s, resistance problem had developed. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p2.20">As soon as the DDT spraying ended, the number of malaria cases each year quickly returned to its pre-DDT level in most of the tropical countries such as Africa and India. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p2.20">Besides this, the serious environmental impairments such as poisoning and eggshell thinning, which people thought was caused by DDT were manifested. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p3.20">In the early 1950s, Derek Ratcliffe of the British Nature Conservancy found that there were number of broken eggs in eyries of peregrine occurring in several regions of British Isles, which he considered to be an abnormal phenomenon. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p3.20">Soon after that, a national wide survey has undertaken by the Nature Conservancy. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p3.20">The result of the survey was astonishing, the population of the new generation of peregrine had declined greatly and that less that one-fifth of the birds successfully rose young in 1961 and 1962. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p3.20">The paper gave a strong impact in the USA, leading to an examination on the population of peregrine and the other birds of prey. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p3.20">The outcome was even worse; the species was extirpated in the North America and had decreased markedly in many countries in Europe. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.20">
<s n="s1.4;p4.20">In mid-1966, Derek Ratcliffe suggested that the phenomenon of eggshell thinning was likely to be the possibility of egg breakage. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p4.20">Shortly, the formula of eggshell index was invented; this formula helps to cut down the measuring time of the large number of specimen without damaging. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p4.20">Using this technique, Ratcliffe examined large amount of Peregrine and Sparrowhawk eggs collected in UK since 1900. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p4.20">His findings show that there was a marked decrease in eggshell thickness in both species in the mid-1940s. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.20">
<s n="s1.6;p5.20">Large amount of research was done neither on Sparrowhawk nor Peregrine but in the brown pelican (<hi rend="italic">Pelecanus occidentalis</hi>), which was experiencing the most dynamic degree of eggshell thinning. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p5.20">The colony on Anacapa Island showed almost complete reproductive failure. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p5.20">Most of the nests were abandoned and remains of crushed eggshell were found throughout the colony. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p5.20">The thickness of eggshell has decreased by half on average. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p5.20">A similar massive study was carried out by the Canadian wildlife service on colonies of cormorants on lake Huron during 1972- 73. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p5.20">The outcome was not as severe as that was found in California but it was bad enough to cause almost completed reproductive failure. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.20">
<s n="s1.5;p6.20">The evidences showed the clear linkage between egg breakage and the reproductive failure. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p6.20">A widespread of analytical work was carried out, showing that there was a relatively high concentration of organchlorine resides in the combination of eggshell compared to the pre-war level. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p6.20">Also, it was shown in raptorial birds, included Peregrine that the higher the level of contamination of the parent by DDE, the greater the degree of eggshell thinning in its eggs. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p7.20">Cooke (1979) has shown by light and electron microscope examination that shell thinning in peregrine eggs involves roughly proportional decreases in thickness of outer and thicker palisade layer and inner and thinner mammillary layer of the shell; suggesting that thin shell result form a decreased rate of deposition. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p7.20">Though the precise physiological and biochemical mechanism involved are still imperfectly understood, there is one common hypothesis suggested by Paul Miller: DDT is readily metabolized into a stable and equally toxic compound, DDE. DDT and DDE are fat-soluble and are stored in adipose tissues. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p7.20">DDE is re-released into the bloodstream when adipose was used for energy during reproduction or from levels of metabolites obtained via recent prey. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p7.20">While in the uterus, DDE inhibited the enzymes carbonic anhydrase and calcium ATP-ase. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p7.20">This enzyme disruption caused partial blockage of the layering of calcium and carbonate on the eggshell, which induced eggshell thinning, and disruption of embryo gas transpiration. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p7.20">This, in turn, facilitated eggshell breakage; embryo toxicity and the resulting crash of the peregrine falcon and Sparrowhawk. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.20">
<s n="s1.3;p8.20">As the consequence of the severe eggshell thinning, the use of DDT was banned in the Scandinavian over the period 1969- 72, and in Holland in 1968. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p8.20">In the Great Britain, voluntary restrictions on both DDT and dieldrin started in 1962, and completed at the end of 1975. </s>

<p n="p9.20">
<s n="s1.3;p9.20">The population of Peregrine and Sparrowhawk started to recover as soon as the DDT was first banned in various countries in the late 1970s according to the decline to the organochlorine residues in the populations of both species. </s>

</p>
<p n="p18.20">
<s n="s1.10;p18.20">The eggshell index of Peregrine falcon,<hi rend="italic"> Falco peregrinus</hi> in 1905 was 2.0. </s>

<s n="s6.10;p18.20">Although the problem was not noticed before 1950, laboratory work shows that the eggshell index started to decrease very shortly after the introduction of DDT. The eggshell index started to rise between 1960 and 1970, contribute to the ban of DDT in Scandinavian and Holland. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p18.20">The eggshell index increased very rapidly after 1970, reaching its peak 1.8, in 1990. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p18.20">This is due to the various reintroductions, breeding program and the banning of DDT in many European countries. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p18.20">According to the graph, there was as slight decrease in eggshell index in 1900-2000. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p18.20">This maybe because the egg has been collected form polluted areas; the population of Peregrine had in fact recover to its pre-war level in 1985. </s>
