<p n="p1.24">
<s n="s1.7;p1.24">For too long the history of the Cold War has been written from a 'top-down' perspective examining elites and decision-makers. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p1.24">Whilst political scientists have become mired in using rational International Relations models, historians have rarely cast their net beyond realpolitik, frequently falling foul of detailed narrative around contingencies which often never occurred. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p1.24">The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the end of the 30-year rule for many documents in the West, which both led to a spate of archival-based sources available to historians, cemented this diplomatic and empirical approach. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p1.24">Moreover, archival work alone is a dangerous place from which to survey the Cold War, since both sides of the Iron Curtain employed 'newspeak' rather than rational discourse, even behind closed doors. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p1.24">In short, this 'New Cold War history' can become overly narrative driven and blind to broader analysis. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p1.24">However, as a result of the growing interest in cultural history following the 1980s 'linguistic turn', recent study, particularly in the so called 'Constructivist' school, has challenged Cold War historians to spread their wings methodologically, and explore the culture of the conflict. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p1.24">In spite of noteworthy 'hot' episodes, such as Vietnam, the Cold War was in most part a conflict of words and images delivered to an audience soaked in its products. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.24">
<s n="s1.6;p2.24">One unmined area of Cold War culture is Hollywood Bomb Cinema. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p2.24">Bomb Cinema denotes films where the nuclear bomb is an explicit part of the theme or narrative and includes a body of films, widely forgotten, from classics such as <hi rend="italic">Dr Strangelove</hi> (1963) to off-beat cult favourites like <hi rend="italic">Them</hi> (1954).<ref target="BAWE_0005c-ftnote.001"/> However, Bomb Cinema remains predominantly the preserve of film departments and media journalists who examine issues such as plot synopsis and entertainment value. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p2.24">Working under Freud's avowal that a cigar is sometimes only a cigar, their inquiry is devoid of any attempt to unearth hidden realities. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p2.24">Apocryphal moments are not examined for anything more than meaningless and pleasurable fantasy. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p2.24">For example, in reviewing <hi rend="italic">Strangelove</hi>, <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi> film critic simply called it a 'farcical comedy about the end of the world' and paid most attention to the 'remarkable performances by Mr Peter Sellers and Mr George. </s>

<p n="p3.24">
<s n="s1.9;p3.24">So why should historians concern themselves about films with images of the bomb? </s>
<s n="s2.9;p3.24">Put simply, the sheer number of these films reveal how deeply concerned Americans were about the bomb. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p3.24">Paul Boyer has argued that the bomb itself is a virtual Kantian category - an internal filter - that shapes our very understanding of the world.<ref target="BAWE_0005c-ftnote.003"/> Taking a psychoanalytic perspective, the bomb is indicative of a repressed dread in US society, concerned about survival, morality, and rebirth. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p3.24">Thinking about the function of these films, Hayden White argues that historical and fictional discourses have common aspects in narratives and transmit messages about shared reality. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p3.24">Accordingly, at any given historical point, there exists a common pool of narratives that every culture disposes for its members who might wish to draw upon them for the transmission of messages.<ref target="BAWE_0005c-ftnote.004"/> As a statistically proven part of the filmgoer's diet - indeed <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi> reported in February 1964 that 'demand to see <hi rend="italic">Strangelove</hi> has been so great...it has been decided to put on special late night showings' - Bomb Cinema is one amongst many narratives available to society in order to understand the bomb.<ref target="BAWE_0005c-ftnote.005"/> Certainly, from an early stage, the significance of the intersection between the cinema and the bomb was recognised by policymakers. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p3.24">For example, the Supreme Command Allied Powers (SCAP) censored references to Hiroshima and Nagasaki in films made during the occupation of Japan. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p3.24">Jacques Derrida, in his work on the 'nuclear subject', has argued that since the terrifying reality of nuclear war can only be the signified referent and never the real referent of a discourse, the view of fictitious projects, such as Bomb Cinema, occupy a space equal to the views of 'experts'.<ref target="BAWE_0005c-ftnote.006"/> Furthermore, in its satirical fashioning or 'black comedy', as apparent in <hi rend="italic">Strangelove</hi>, Bomb Cinema is increasingly about the workings of power. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p3.24">By giving a privileged opportunity to laugh at those in authority, Bomb Cinema can afford the individual the bitter-sweet illusion of panoptical power on the inside, by stripping away his real Cold War position of powerlessness on the outside. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p3.24">Seen in this way, the term subversion is synonymous with liberated power for the individual. </s>

<p n="p4.24">
<s n="s1.9;p4.24">By deconstructing key bomb films, it will be argued that by 1963 and <hi rend="italic"> Strangelove</hi>, Bomb Cinema had become an agent of subversion. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p4.24">The state sponsored <hi rend="italic">Strategic Air Command 1955 (SAC)</hi>, which projected a halcyon era of acquiescence and all-pervasive Cold War conformity, stands as the archetypal propaganda film for point of comparison. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p4.24">
<hi rend="italic">Strangelove</hi> exploded absolutely the state led propaganda line. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p4.24">However, far from heralding the first cataclysmic step outside of the propaganda paradigm, <hi rend="italic">Strangelove</hi> is best seen as an umbrella for earlier subversive messages emerging in certain 1950s bomb films. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p4.24">Working under the constant eye of the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), the distinctly science fiction wing of Bomb Cinema used covert images to depict the anxieties that accompanied life with the bomb.<ref target="BAWE_0005c-ftnote.007"/> Indeed, Stanley Kubrick was an avid watcher of 1950s SF, and <hi rend="italic">Strangelove</hi> can be seen as consciously linking disparate aspects of a genre. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p4.24">Part of the so-called 'Cold War camp', SF films like <hi rend="italic">The Thing</hi> (1951), <hi rend="italic">The Day The Earth Stood Still</hi> (1951), <hi rend="italic">Them</hi>,<hi rend="italic"> Forbidden Planet</hi> (1956) and <hi rend="italic">The Incredible Shrinking Man</hi> (1957) were intentionally self-parodic, utilising 'grand guignol' horror techniques of invasions of predatory insects and plants, in order to appeal to a generation of rebels without a cause, plagued by fears of isolation. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p4.24">Yet, as Peter Biskind recognises, these films were very rarely in universal agreement and did have varying degrees of departure from the propaganda paradigm.<ref target="BAWE_0005c-ftnote.008"/> My methodology is interdisciplinary and borrows from the recent Cold War Cultures School in history, including my supervisor, Dr. Patrick Major, requiring the socio-political contextualisation of films, as well as the production and reception history. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p4.24">Thus, this paper uses not only the films themselves but also draft scripts, biographies and newspaper reviews and articles of the period. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p4.24">The issues examined here - nuclear proliferation, Organisation Man, scientists and technology - are the most prevalent in Bomb films. </s>

<p n="p5.24">
<s n="s1.13;p5.24">Nuclear proliferation is the most obvious theme in bomb films. </s>
<s n="s2.13;p5.24">In our period, the nuclear powers exponentially increased their arsenals of destructive potential, within the prevailing and public strategy of Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD). </s>
<s n="s3.13;p5.24">Ex-US Defense Secretary (1961-68), and architect of MAD, Robert McNamara later called proliferation 'the foundation of stable deterrence in a nuclear world...resting on the understanding that if either side initiates the use of nuclear weapons, the other side will respond with sufficient power to inflict unacceptable damage'.<ref target="BAWE_0005c-ftnote.009"/> World War II laid a precedent for the state taking a manipulative role in fashioning Hollywood films. </s>
<s n="s4.13;p5.24">
<hi rend="italic">SAC</hi> - aided in its making by the US Air Force, who allowed the B-36 bomber to be filmed - defends the arms race completely. </s>
<s n="s5.13;p5.24">It depicts the bomber force as a safeguard to protect Americans from the bomb. </s>
<s n="s6.13;p5.24">Real SAC imagery is always at work, such as the billboard sign at the base entrance, 'the nation and your security are at stake', and the Command's motto, 'Peace is our Profession'. </s>
<s n="s7.13;p5.24">The dialogue supports this argument too with Rusty asserting 'we're the only thing that keeps the peace'.<ref target="BAWE_0005c-ftnote.010"/> In the hands of trustworthy fellows, such as Dutch, nuclear weapons are seen as banal and manageable. </s>
<s n="s8.13;p5.24">However, the main function of the film was to ingrain in citizens the moral resolve needed to live in the Cold War. </s>
<s n="s9.13;p5.24">Security officials knew it would have been impossible to protect Americans from nuclear attack. </s>
<s n="s10.13;p5.24">For example, Millard Caldwell - head of the Federal Civil Defense Administration 1950-52 - believed that 'when a situation is utterly hopeless, it may be better not to say so. </s>
<s n="s11.13;p5.24">The doctors often conclude against telling the hopeless cancer patient what the situation is'.<ref target="BAWE_0005c-ftnote.011"/> By cultivating an image of safety, <hi rend="italic">SAC</hi> hoped not only to curb the problem of panic, the invisible fifth column at home, but to ensure continued support for the policy of deterrence. </s>
<s n="s12.13;p5.24">It is worth remembering that, at the time of the film's release, the Alert America campaigns were in full swing, and the gospel of self-help was the new mantra of civil defence planners. </s>
<s n="s13.13;p5.24">By showing reluctant cold warriors, and their even more reluctant wives, subordinating their civilian lives to the demands of the state, <hi rend="italic">SAC</hi> urges civilians both to accept the secrecy of the Military Industrial Complex (MIC) and even buy into it. </s>

<hi rend="italic">Them</hi> also looks despairingly at proliferation and examines the harmful effects of radioactive fallout; an issue particularly prevalent at the time of the film's release given the alarming implications of the Bikini test shots and the 1954 Lucky Dragon incident. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p8.24">According to Allan Winkler, fallout focused public fears because it threatened a less violent form of extinction and presented the danger of both psychological, as well as physical deformity.<ref target="BAWE_0005c-ftnote.015"/> Learning that the radioactive man-eating ants crawled out of a New Mexico test site, <hi rend="italic">Them</hi> rejects the safety of atmospheric testing, and the ability of statesmen to keep a lid on the nuclear Pandora's box. </s>
