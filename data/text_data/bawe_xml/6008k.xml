<s n="s1.3;p1.27">Sensory profiling, also known as descriptive analysis, is a method to identify, define and quantify the intensity of different sensory characteristics that can be identified in a set of food products. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p1.27">It is a process in which 8-12 trained panelists detect and describe both the qualitative and quantitative attributes contributing to the sensory characteristics of the food. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p2.27">Other than price, sensory quality is also an important issue for deciding which food products to purchase. </s>
