<div2>
<head rend="bold">1.2 Context and Motivation</head>
<div3>
<head>1.2.1 Why need of the new system?</head>
<p n="p7.126">
<s n="s1.4;p7.126">In recent years, the online computing environment has afforded exciting new opportunities to buy and sell goods and services for both businesses and individuals. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p7.126">In the United Kingdom, the number of people making Internet card payments (using credit or debit card) increased 50 percent between 2003 and 2004 to 20 million (APACS 2004). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p7.126">Nearly 15 million people in the UK now use the Internet to access their bank accounts, and millions more regularly shop online. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p7.126">This growing customer use of the Internet and credit cards has provided businesses with chance to expand their customer bases provide quicker and more efficient services and reduce overheads. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.126">
<s n="s1.3;p8.126">With such a dramatic uptake of online shopping, however, have come increased risks of online credit card fraud. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p8.126">In particular, businesses that provide online shopping are more vulnerable than ever before to the risk of credit card fraud and associated loose. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p8.126">According to Card Watch the Plastic card fraud losses on UK-issued cards from 1995 - 2004 have risen to £504.8 million. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.126">
<s n="s1.1;p9.126">The financial cost to cardholders of card fraud is largely borne by the banking industry, but the personal cost in time, inconvenience and frustration while an incident is investigated - being without cards, waiting for fraudulent expenditure to be reversed or offset, the sense of violation - is immeasurable. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.126">
<s n="s1.1;p10.126">So, I believe there is a need for a new system which could reduce the amount of money lost due to online fraud and make online shoppers more confident while doing online shopping from anywhere in the world. </s>
</p>
</div3>
<div3>
<head>1.2.2 The need for strong Authentication and Fraud Detection Methods</head>
<p n="p11.126">
<s n="s1.3;p11.126">Even as innovative business models and impressive advances in technology fuel industry's vision of the Internet as a dynamic medium of commerce and communication, security issues continues to weaken confidence in online business. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p11.126">One of the most vexing and serious security issues is related to identity verification. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p11.126">If users and devices accessing the networks are not properly identified, enterprise risk exposure to threats like fraud, identity theft etc. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.126">
<s n="s1.2;p12.126">The project aims to solve this problem by offer strong authentication methods using Windows Forms and SMS technology to identify the user. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p12.126">After in-depth research Neural Networks algorithms combined with Data Mining has been used to identify fraudulent transactions at early stages. </s>
</p>
</div3>
<div3>
<head>1.2.3 Lack of Interoperable Solution</head>
<p n="p13.126">
<s n="s1.3;p13.126">To accommodate diverse usage scenarios, enterprises frequently deploy multiple authentication and detection mechanism. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p13.126">Because these solutions rely on proprietary hardware, protocols and middleware, they do not interoperate easily with other products. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p13.126">The project aims to offer an interoperable solution to online problem, so that solution can easily be integrated with any other solutions to further extend the model. </s>
</p>
</div3>
<div3>
<head>1.2.4 why did I choose to work on Transactional Model?</head>
<p n="p14.126">
<s n="s1.3;p14.126">Financial sector and the use of technology in that sector has been a personal interest since I was a kid. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p14.126">I have always been impressed with the way technology have transformed this sector from those fish-market like trading floors to tranquil floors. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p14.126">I have also been interested in technical challenges the financial industry been facing these days. </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.126">
<s n="s1.4;p15.126">The project idea was conceived when I was working in British Telecommunication. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p15.126">For academic year 2004-2005 I did an Industrial placement, which has been a great learning exposure for me. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p15.126">The year gave me sufficient time to decide upon my project topic and work on something in which I had genuine interest. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p15.126">Another motivation while working was to do a project which in some ways provided solution to some current problems prevalent in the market. </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.126">
<s n="s1.2;p16.126">Having keen interest in transactional modelling and especially authorisation phase of the process that involves authentication and identity checks of the users, I started to research the market and closely understand the problem. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p16.126">It was after that research I realised that the credit card fraud problem is not just for UK but the situation is even worst in countries such as Australia, United Stated of America etc. </s>
</p>
<p n="p17.126">
<s n="s1.1;p17.126">So, It was the time when I knew what I wanted to do for my final year project and come up with a solution which is practical and with right amount of resources and funding could be implemented in real-life scenario. </s>
</p>
<p n="p18.126">
<s n="s1.2;p18.126">My next aim was to design the project in a most sophisticated and state of art technology. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p18.126">While doing my research I came across various technologies that I could have used but I went with .NET because of it's benefits and its upcoming attracting in financial firms. </s>
</p>
<p n="p19.126">
<s n="s1.3;p19.126">After all careful considerations I decided to implemented the project in .NET technology supported by SQL Database. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p19.126">Before starting the final year I did an intensive course in .NET for three months to have in-depth understanding of the technology and successfully gained the accreditations of Microsoft Certified Solution Developer. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p19.126">The technology aspect is covered in more detail in Appendix B. </s>

<s n="s2.7;p40.126">Not only is this an important convenience for the customers, it also means more revenue for the merchants. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p40.126">Many merchants say that 20% of their revenue is through online stores. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p40.126">Another benefit that merchants gain from online store is the reduction in overhead costs, as the merchants don't need to employ staff to take orders. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p40.126">With the right payment processing tools, these functions are all done automatically. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p40.126">And lastly an online store helps merchants to reach markets across the countries. </s>

</p>
<p n="p42.126">
<s n="s1.3;p42.126">But, as e-commerce has been an extra source of income for online traders, it has also been a source of income for people who make revenue by using stolen cards and information. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p42.126">Fraud is increasing dramatically these days with expansion of modern technology, resulting in the loss of billion of pounds each year. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p42.126">Revenue lost through Credit Card fraud in the United Kingdom has been growing rapidly over last five years with £504.8 million lost in 2005 (Report by Association of Payment Clearing Services, London APACS). </s>

<p n="p43.126">
<s n="s1.4;p43.126">The <hi rend="italic">Concise Oxford Dictionary</hi> defines fraud as "criminal deception; the use of false representations to gain an unjust advantage." </s>

<s n="s3.4;p43.126">However, in recent years, the development of new technologies (which have made it easier for us to communicate and helped increase our spending power) has also provided yet further ways in which criminals may commit fraud. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p43.126">Traditional forms of fraudulent behavior such as money laundering have become easier to perpetrate and have been joined by new kinds of fraud such as mobile telecommunications fraud and computer intrusion. </s>
</p>
<p n="p44.126">
<s n="s1.6;p44.126">Credit Card fraud can be divided into two types: Offline and Online Fraud. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p44.126">Offline Fraud is committed by using a stolen physical card at storefront or call center. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p44.126">Online Fraud commonly known as cardholder - not present fraud occurs, when the transaction is made remotely, which means customer is not physically present at the merchant's shop but either is doing a telephone purchase or an online transaction. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p44.126">In an online transaction, no signatures or card imprints are required, only need is of a valid payment card details. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p44.126">Online Fraud accounts for most proportion of money lost because of Credit Card Frauds. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p44.126">It's due to week authentication methods, which makes it easier to commit online fraud as compared to Offline fraud where new technologies have really helped in reducing the amount of revenue lost each year. </s>

</p>
<p n="p62.126">
<s n="s1.2;p62.126">In a similar way, online traders can request that the customer confirm or enter the CVN, usually a three- or four-digit number now printed on the back of the majority of credit cards. </s>
