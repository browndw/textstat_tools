<s n="s1.4;p1.17">A new age of transportation commenced in 1830s America when the first railroad, from Baltimore to Ohio, went into operation following decades of agitation for an enhanced mode of transport. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p1.17">The revolutionary birth of the railroad was greeted with the 'enthusiastic consensus that railways were sublime and that they would help to unify, dignify, expand and enrich the nation'<ref target="BAWE_0129j-ftnote.001"/>, through the prosperity that would be garnered from increasing trade and development, which would be facilitated by the railroads dynamism. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p1.17">This new medium of transport did indeed have an immense impact on the nations' economy as it stimulated industry as well as agriculture, by enabling farmers to retail their crops in distance markets only accessible by railroad. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p1.17">However, it was not always a case of improvement as regional specialisation tended to occur, and thus many Americans experienced prosperity at the expense of others: 'it brought immediate economic disaster for some, feverish land speculation, and long term economic disaster for all.' <ref target="BAWE_0129j-ftnote.002"/> </s>

<s n="s2.3;p2.17">The railroad transformed American life and culture dramatically and was vastly significant in generating popularity for the most renowned amusement resort in turn-of-the-century America, Atlantic City, which was situated at the northern tip of Absecon Island in New Jersey. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p2.17">However, it would only become so renowned as a result of the importance of the railroad, and thus its importance was crucial. </s>

<p n="p5.17">
<s n="s1.6;p5.17">The completion of the Pennsylvania and Reading railroads, running between New York, Philadelphia and Atlantic City (*after the Civil War?*), was extremely significant in generating popularity of the resort as it enabled pleasure-seekers to travel there from a wide expanse of surrounding states, including Cleveland, Chicago, Detroit, Pittsburg, and even Canada. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p5.17">In 1873, 'nearly half a million people made the fifty-five mile trip from Philadelphia to Atlantic City'<ref target="BAWE_0129j-ftnote.010"/>, emphasising the importance of the railroad in generating popularity for the mass resort. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p5.17">Furthermore the bridge across the Delaware River, constructed by the Pennsylvania Road in the late 1880s, meant that railcars could avoid the transfer across Philadelphia. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p5.17">This allowed tourists to travel a more direct route to Atlantic City and cut down travel time and expenses, generating further popularity for the resort especially among the less well off. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p5.17">The railroad was thus an indispensable means of delivering people to this seaside resort, and it would not have grown so popular without the railroad, as there would not have been the same level of accessibility thus would not have had the vast numbers of visitors. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p5.17">As M. D. Youngman asserts: 'As to the means of reaching Atlantic City the directions are extremely simple...-'Apply at any railroad ticket office.''<ref target="BAWE_0129j-ftnote.011"/> Accordingly the popularity of Atlantic City became nationwide, as people across the country were able to travel there by this advanced means of transportation. </s>

<s n="s3.5;p6.17">The importance of the railroad in generating popularity for this resort can be seen because it 'opened the...great sequoias of tourism'<ref target="BAWE_0129j-ftnote.012"/> by encouraging low fared excursions. </s>

<s n="s5.5;p6.17">The railroad had an overwhelming physical presence in daily life and Americans found it 'thrilling, and proved passionately fond of everything connected with it'<ref target="BAWE_0129j-ftnote.014"/>, including Atlantic City, yet they were more interested in their own experience than concerning themselves with the economic and labour implications of the railroad. </s>

<s n="s4.5;p7.17">'Such advances could not fail to increase human happiness'<ref target="BAWE_0129j-ftnote.015"/> and the feeling of liberation felt at what was, then, the fastest passenger service in history. </s>
