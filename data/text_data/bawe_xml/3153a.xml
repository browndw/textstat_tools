<p n="p1.49">
<s n="s1.4;p1.49">Tourism can be thought of as a rather complicated activity that overlaps various different sectors of the society and economy. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p1.49">Without planning, it may generate several unwanted and unexpected impacts (World Tourism Organization, 1994). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p1.49">Therefore tourism should be developed and managed in a controlled and sustainable way, based on sound planning. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p1.49">Moreover, it should be integrated within the wide planning process in order to promote certain goals of economic, social and environmental enhancement which may be accomplished through appropriate tourism development (Hall, 2000). </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.49">
<s n="s1.3;p2.49">This coursework will provide a critical analysis of what a tourism plan/ planning is and what are the benefits of its implementation. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p2.49">It will evaluate the planning process, the elements that should be included within a tourism plan and the methods of implementation. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p2.49">Furthermore, it will set out the implications of adopting a tourism plan for a specific destination. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.49">
<s n="s1.4;p3.49">The selected area for the purpose of this coursework is Kranjska Gora in Slovenia, which at the time of writing does not have an existing tourism plan. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p3.49">Kranjska Gora is situated in the area of the Zgornjesavska valley, located at the north west of Slovenia between the Karavanke Mountains and the Julian Alps. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p3.49">Kranjska Gora is a year-round mountain tourist resort as well as an important winter sports resort with a variety of skiing slopes available. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p3.49">The size of the municipality of Kranjska Gora is 256,3 kmÂ² (Municipality of Kranjska Gora, undated; Kranjska Gora, undated). </s>

<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">DEFINITION OF A TOURISM PLAN/PLANNING</head>
<p n="p4.49">
<s n="s1.4;p4.49">Tourism planning relates to the same basic concepts and approaches as general planning; however, it is adapted to the specific characteristics of the tourism system.A plan can be defined as a set of various decisions for action in the future (Hall, 2000). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p4.49">Several authors agree that the most significant feature of any type of planning, including tourism planning, is its orientation towards the future (Hall, 2000; Gunn, 2002). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p4.49">According to Inskeep (1991), planning for tourism is a step-by-step process which should be continuous, comprehensive, integrated, and environmental, focusing on achieving sustainable development and community involvement. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p4.49">Gunn (2002) similarly suggests that tourism planning should be directed towards four main goals: <hi rend="italic">sustainable use of resources,</hi> <hi rend="italic">enhanced visitor satisfaction</hi>,<hi rend="italic"> integration of local community and area</hi> and <hi rend="italic">improved economy and business success.</hi> </s>

<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">BENEFITS OF TOURISM PLANNING </head>
<p n="p5.49">
<s n="s1.7;p5.49">Numerous authors emphasize the importance of tourism planning (Godfrey and Clarke, 2000; Hall, 2000; Gunn, 2002; Inskeep, 1991). </s>
<s n="s2.7;p5.49">According to Gunn (2002) the purpose of planning is to create plans of action for a foreseeable future and implement them. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p5.49">Furthermore, the tourism sector goals and objectives can be achieved more effectively and efficiently if carefully planned and integrated into the country's overall development plan and programme. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p5.49">In addition, careful planning at all levels and good management are necessary to optimize the benefits of tourism and preventing or at least mitigating any problems that may occur (Inskeep, 1991). </s>
<s n="s5.7;p5.49">Hall (2000) similarly suggests that planning can help to minimise potential negative impacts, maximise economic returns to the area, and thus encourage a more positive response from the local community towards tourism in the longer run. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p5.49">Moreover, in the countries, where not much tourism has developed yet, planning can provide the necessary guidelines for its development. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p5.49">On the other hand, for the areas where tourism is already well established, planning is often needed to revitalize the sector and maintain its future viability (World Tourism Organization, 1994). </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.49">
<s n="s1.4;p6.49">In Kranjska Gora tourism planning could help to achieve long-term sustainable development of the area, ensuring that the natural, cultural, and other resources of tourism are conserved for the future use. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p6.49">Moreover, it could bring benefits to the society and provide level of tourist satisfaction essential for tourism success in the area and country as a whole. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p6.49">Tourism development plan for Kranjska Gora should provide a framework through which the area's tourism policy will be acted upon, ensuring the development reflects local values, and is an overall benefit to the tourism industry. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p6.49">As such the tourism plan should analyse the present situation in Kranjska Gora as well as provide recommendations for improvement in the area, based on sustainable development (e.g. modernisation of the ski lifts, improved road access etc.) (Strategy of Slovenian Tourism, undated). </s>

<head rend="bold">ELEMENTS OF A TOURISM PLAN, TOURISM PLANNING PROCESS and IMPLICATIONS FOR THE DESTINATION</head>
<p n="p7.49">
<s n="s1.3;p7.49">Tourism planning at the destination level is a step-by-step process of resource and market analysis, action and review. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p7.49">Elements of a tourism plan together with the tourism planning process will now be evaluated and implications for the destination suggested. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p7.49">PASOLP planning approach, adapted from Baud-Bovy and Lawson (1998), in combination with Godfrey and Clarke's (2000) and World Tourism Organization's (1994) approach to tourism planning, will be used. </s>
</p>
<div2>
<head rend="bold italic">Tourism policy and committee structure</head>
<p n="p8.49">
<s n="s1.1;p8.49">At the first stage a tourism policy should be set as a framework through which tourism issues are/will be analysed and decisions taken. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p9.49">
<s n="s1.2;p9.49">Municipality of Kranjska Gora should firstly establish a dedicated team or committee, who should create a tourism plan for Kranjska Gora jointly with local resident groups; local and national government; regional tourism groups; special interest community groups; business associations; private sector groups; and external consultant advisers if necessary. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p9.49">Organization and coordination among them is the key to success. </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="bold italic">Tourism resource audit</head>
<p n="p10.49">
<s n="s1.2;p10.49">A destination's tourism resource base is the core of that location's tourism appeal. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p10.49">One main function of the tourism resource audit is to identify the area's key assets and to examine destination's strengths and weaknesses from a supply point of view (Godfrey and Clarke, 2000; Inskeep, 1991). </s>

</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p12.49">
<s n="s1.2;p12.49">Primary and secondary attractions should be evaluated; for example, primary resources of Kranjska Gora are its natural resources (mountains) which provide all-year tourist services from winter sports to mountainous tourism. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p12.49">Sports tournaments are another primary attraction of the area (World Cup competitions in alpine skiing and ski flights on the giant ski-jump in Planica, the neighbour village of Kranjska Gora); </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p13.49">

<head rend="bold italic">Tourism market analysis</head>
<p n="p18.49">

<s n="s1.7;p49.49">Communities, regions and countries benefit substantially from the proper tourism planning. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p49.49">Due to the tourism growth and its numerous and diverse impacts, Kranjska Gora should adopt a plan to manage these effects efficiently. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p49.49">It is necessary that planners consider both the costs and benefits that tourism brings to the area and that the principles of sustainable development are followed (Wall and Mathieson, 2006). </s>
<s n="s4.7;p49.49">Furthermore, in today's highly competitive tourism world, places with well planned tourism development are likely to be the most successful tourism destinations. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p49.49">A proper tourism plan, which would analyse Kranjska Gora's current position with regard to tourism, identify development opportunities as well as constraints, is therefore of a great importance for the destination. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p49.49">As such it could help to achieve higher tourist satisfaction levels and bring significant benefits, with minimal disturbance, to the society, local economy and the environment (Inskeep, 1991). </s>
<s n="s7.7;p49.49">It is crucial that the plan and its sub-components have respective time frames, towards which all involved parties, responsible for tourism development in Kranjska Gora, work in a coordinated manner to achieve the common long-term goals and objectives. </s>
