<head rend="bold">Questions </head>
<div3>
<head rend="bold">Why , after 7 days incubation , is there merit in exposing the tubes to room air and reincubating them ? </head>
<p n="p9.27">
<s n="s1.1;p9.27">Assuming that they were not contaminated in the first place ,To test the possibility of infection with micro-organisms from aerial contaminants which demonstrates the need to follow the technique for aseptic pipetting closely more specifically to work quickly avoiding exposing one's samples to air. </s>
</p>
</div3>
<div3>
<head rend="bold">What does this extra test signify? </head>
<p n="p10.27">
<s n="s1.2;p10.27">In the extra test, mould growth was observed in two of the test tubes whilst turbidity was observed in one test tube. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p10.27">2 test tubes remained clear. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.27">
<s n="s1.1;p11.27">This extra test signifies that infection with pathogenic microoganisms from the air around can happen fairly easily hence the importance of taking all steps to maintain aseptic conditions initially and ensuring these conditions are maintained to prevent contamination later. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.27">
<s n="s1.1;p12.27">It also signifies the presence of more than one micro organism present in the air around us bacteria which cause turbidity and spores which result in mould growth . </s>

</div3>
<div3>
<head rend="bold">What kinds of contaminating bacteria would NOT grow in the medium under the conditions of incubation </head>
<p n="p13.27">
<s n="s1.1;p13.27">Anaerobic bacteria - as air was present in the test tubes </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.27">
<s n="s1.1;p14.27">Bacteria that need temperatures lower than 20째 C to grow (psychrophiles) grow , or temperatures very much higher than 25째C ( thermophiles ) </s>
</p>
</div3>
<div3>
<head rend="bold">Are these organisms common in air and dust ? </head>
<p n="p15.27">
<s n="s1.1;p15.27">No. Psychrophiles (cold-loving microorganisms) are found mostly in the depths of the oceans, in ice and snow and in the arctic regions most of our common spoilage whilst Thermophiles (heat-loving microbes) with an optimum above 60째C are found in extreme environments such as geological hot springs. </s>

<head rend="bold">Suppose in making an aseptic transfer that 10 aerial contaminants get access to the dispensed culture medium. What is likely to happen if :</head>
<p rend="ordered" n="p16.27">
<s n="s1.1;p16.27">
<hi rend="bold">a) the medium is liquid</hi>: given the right growth conditions of temperature the aerial contaminants will grow and divide rapidly resulting in a very large culture of microorganisms in the culture medium. </s>
</p>
<p rend="ordered" n="p17.27">
<s n="s1.1;p17.27">
<hi rend="bold">b) the medium is an agar medium</hi> : Given the right growth conditions the aerial contaminants will multiply however if there are different kinds they will grow in isolation from each other and will not spread out over the surface of the agar , instead they will grow in clumps or colonies . </s>

<head rend="bold">DISCUSSION &amp; CONCLUSION</head>
<p n="p18.27">
<s n="s1.1;p18.27">This experiment tested the hypothesis that all natural materials, including air, water, dust skin and soil contain microorganisms that may infect cultures or sterile solutions. </s>
</p>
<p n="p19.27">
<s n="s1.2;p19.27">It was also important to demonstrate that simple precautionary measures in aseptic techniques can be used to prevent contamination and exclude these microorganisms. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p19.27">The importance of working quickly , working close to the bunsen flame ( where air current flows upwards) and holding the tubes as near horizontal as possible was clearly demonstrated after observing the test tubes which had been exposed to air for an hour. </s>
</p>
<p n="p20.27">
<s n="s1.2;p20.27">The results from the first week demonstrated that aseptic pipetting can be carried out successfully as no turbidity or mould growth was observed after one week except in one sample from the bench results . </s>
<s n="s2.2;p20.27">Whilst the results after exposure to air indicated that contamination from the air does occur . </s>

<head rend="underlined bold">EXERCISE 1 QUESTIONS</head>
<div2>
<head rend="bold">Why is it necessary to dry the surface of agar plates before they are streaked ? </head>
<p n="p21.27">
<s n="s1.1;p21.27">If it is not dry the liquid will not be absorbed and separated colonies will not be obtained . </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="bold">Why are agar plates of bacterial cultures incubated inverted ? </head>
<p n="p22.27">
<s n="s1.2;p22.27">This is because as the bacterial cells grow and multiply they produce moisture and this would fall back onto the surface of the nutrient agar if the plates were not inverted. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p22.27">This might contaminate the surface further and result in improper dilution/spread of the microorganism. </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="bold">Explain the principle of streaking a plate to obtain isolated colonies</head>
<p n="p23.27">
<s n="s1.1;p23.27">The principle of streaking a plate is to spread out a drop of bacterial culture on an agar plate such that it becomes progressively more and more dilute resulting, if carried out correctly in individual cells being deposited on the surface of the agar . </s>
</p>
<p n="p24.27">
<s n="s1.1;p24.27">These individual cells would then divide severally during their incubation and result in the formation of a bacterial colony visible to the naked eye . </s>
</p>
<p n="p25.27">
<s n="s1.1;p25.27">A colony 'in theory' represents the off spring of a single cell hence its members ought to be genetically identical </s>
</p>
</div2>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="underlined bold">EXERCISE 3 QUESTIONS</head>
<div2>
<head rend="bold">Why are isolated bacterial colonies (i.e. those well separated from other colonies) on the surface of agar media typically circular in plain view? </head>
<p n="p26.27">
<s n="s1.2;p26.27">Each bacterial colony results from a single cell . </s>
<s n="s2.2;p26.27">As agar is a solid medium the multiplying cells cannot spread out across its surface and they instead grow where initial cell was deposited in these circular looking clumps or groups. </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="bold">What shape would you predict for a mould colony growing suspended in the middle of a bottle of a liquid medium? </head>
<p n="p27.27">
