<s n="s2.2;p1.43">These methods can work simultaneously or alone. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.43">
<s n="s1.3;p2.43">Radiation- is the transfer of energy via electromagnetic waves. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p2.43">This requires no medium therefore can work in a vacuum. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p2.43">This is the main transfer of energy emitted from stars (and all other bodies above absolute zero) through space. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.43">
<s n="s1.3;p3.43">Conduction- works via the physical interaction between molecules. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p3.43">All molecules above absolute zero vibrate to some degree, these vibrations transfer energy from one molecule to all the adjacent molecules. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p3.43">Fourier's law governs heat transfer via conduction. </s>

<p n="p4.43">
<s n="s1.3;p4.43">Convection- takes place through the motion of fluid. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p4.43">On a macro scale level the flow of fluid transfers energy from/to a surface. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p4.43">Conduction slightly contributes to this method at the micro scale level. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.43">
<s n="s1.5;p5.43">When more than one of these methods contributes to heat transfer the total heat transferred can be split into the component amounts. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p5.43">For the purpose of this experiment each method will take place but it is possible to calculate the amounts for which each contributes. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p5.43">Firstly conduction can be neglected as it only acts over the leads that suspend the element. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p5.43">As these leads are long and thin the heat transfer via conduction is minimal. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p8.43">The ideal method for calculating the heat transfer via radiation is to create a vacuum inside the vessel. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p8.43">This would totally restrict any heat transfer via convection as there is no medium for it to occur in. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p8.43">The trouble is that a complete vacuum cannot be obtained with this equipment so a slightly different method has to be used. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p8.43">This involves calculating the emissivity of the element by plotting element and vessel temperature against varying pressure (to the power of four). </s>
<s n="s5.6;p8.43">Then extrapolating the graphs back to zero pressure. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p8.43">The corresponding temperatures can then be used in the following equation to calculate the emissivity; </s>

<s n="s2.5;p11.43">At ambient pressure (atmospheric) the temperatures of the element and vessel are taken. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p11.43">These are then used in conjunction with the previously calculated emissivity and electrical power input to the element to calculate the heat transfer via convection. </s>

</p>
<p n="p16.43">
<s n="s1.2;p16.43">At low pressure there are relatively few particles in the vessel so any excited particle has the ability to bounce back and forth from the element to vessel wall with little obstruction of other particles. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p17.43">At high pressure there are relatively many particles in the vessel. </s>

<s n="s3.3;p17.43">This slows down the heat transfer from the element to vessel as the energy is dissipated over many more particles. </s>
