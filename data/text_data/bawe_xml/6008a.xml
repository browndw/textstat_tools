<p n="p25.34">
<s n="s1.5;p25.34">The red layer on the nutrient agar slope showed that there was bacterial growth. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p25.34">The nutrient broth turned turbid meant there was bacterial growth as well. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p25.34">There were red and identical streak lines on the nutrient agar plate. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p25.34">This showed that there was bacterial growth and a pure culture was obtained. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p25.34">However, there was no isolated colony present as the bacterial growth was not separated far away enough or the growth was too concentrated and there were still a large number of cells. </s>
</p>
<p n="p26.34">
<s n="s1.4;p26.34">There were a lot of bacterial growths in the three inoculating media. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p26.34">These showed that inoculating of pure cultures could be successfully achieved under aseptic conditions and by using aseptic techniques. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p26.34">If the streak lines were not identical or there was growth present not on the streak lines, the agar plate was contaminated and resulted in an impure culture. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p26.34">For microbiological investigations, it is essential to learn the skills of inoculating cultures onto culture media and subculturing from one medium to another. </s>
</p>
<p n="p27.34">
<s n="s1.8;p27.34">There may be errors in performing the experiment. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p27.34">The caps of the bottles containing the media may be closed too tightly. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p27.34">Thus air cannot go into the bottles and the cultures could not grow properly without sufficient air. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p27.34">There may not have isolated colonies obtained on the nutrient agar plat. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p27.34">This is due to removing too much bacterial growth from the original colony, not using a sterile loop for each streak stage or streaking a wet plate. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p27.34">In the repeated plate, the loop should be flame sterilised in each successive step as many cells remained on the loop. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p27.34">To prevent aerial contamination during streaking, the plate is held at an angle sufficient to perform the streaking process or the plate is left on the bench with the lid tilted wide enough for performing streaking. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p27.34">These provide some barriers to minimise aerial contamination. </s>
</p>
<p n="p28.34">
<s n="s1.3;p28.34">Aseptic technique is a procedure to guarantee sterility and to reduce contamination. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p28.34">This usually involves disinfection of working areas, minimisation of microbial access from the air to the exposed media and use of flame to kill bacteria which may enter bottles when they are opened. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p28.34">Aseptic technique is very important and needed to be applied when handling microorganisms. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p29.34">It is necessary to dry the surface of agar plates before they are streaked because water contained many micro-organisms which will contaminate the plate. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p29.34">Then we cannot inoculate a pure culture. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p29.34">The moisture present will interfere with the production of discrete colonies. </s>

<p rend="ordered" n="p30.34">
<s n="s1.4;p30.34">The agar plates of bacterial cultures are incubated inverted as to prevent the condensed moisture on the lid from dropping onto the bacterial growth. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p30.34">Moisture dropping down onto the agar will cause fluid to run across the agar medium and cause contamination. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p30.34">This is also used to reduce bacterial contamination as the bacteria need to go upside down to approach the agar, even they get into the plate through the gap in between the lip and the base. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p30.34">Also, this provides a path for gaseous exchange as the bacteria need air to grow well. </s>
