<s n="s2.6;p3.24">During this period major cities, particularly New York, flourished as a result of rapidly expanding foreign trade that dramatically impacted the urban economy. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p3.24">Increased shipping and improved railroad transportation led New York to emerge as America's pre-eminent city and economic capital during this era. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p3.24">Spiralling growth in key sectors, such as finance, transformed New York from a port city into a leading industrial and commercial metropolis. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p3.24">Coupled with escalating real estate values, this transformation was decisive in enabling ideas of taller buildings to become a feasible reality. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p3.24">Sophisticated technological advances of the era prompted the rapid and bewildering development of skyscrapers in America. </s>

<p n="p4.24">
<s n="s1.3;p4.24">The history of the skyscraper is frequently equated with the development of the elevator, which made tall buildings practical. </s>
