<s n="s2.7;p2.38">We will discuss the transition of the sublime understanding from Burke to Kant in the 18 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> century and then consider the work of the Romantic and Mystic Arthur Schopenhauer, writing in the mid-19 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> century. </s>

<s n="s7.7;p2.38">The accounts of the sublime in the 18 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> - 19 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> century attempt to reconcile this apparent paradox. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.38">
<s n="s1.6;p3.38">Burke and Kant were the first philosophers to develop the sublime as an <hi rend="italic">essential</hi> part of a theory of aesthetics. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p3.38">Burke and Kant are notably similar in the way they view the general differences between the beautiful and the sublime. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p3.38">Both thinkers see the beautiful as light, delightful, appealing and delicate and the sublime as dark, profound, overwhelming and rugged. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p3.38">The sublime not only differs from but is <hi rend="italic">distinct</hi> from the beautiful (they are mutually excusive), but their accounts of what the sublime is differ hugely. </s>

<p n="p4.38">
<s n="s1.4;p4.38">Burke's major work, <hi rend="italic">A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful,</hi> was the first work to fully distinguish, with some success, the beautiful from the sublime. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p4.38">Whilst the beautiful produces a direct and benign pleasure, the sublime experience is at once thrilling and exhilarating, an indirectly delightful horror. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p4.38">The sublime object or event, such as the ocean, provides a threat of destruction to the subject.<ref target="BAWE_0407b-endnote.001"/> Here there is the sense of danger which creates in the subject a sense of terror or horror, but at the same time the subject is a spectator, shielded from the real threat of destruction. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p4.38">It is an essential part of the sublime experience that the spectator is at a distance or removed from the object or event.<ref target="BAWE_0407b-endnote.002"/> The pleasure comes, on the most basic level, from knowing that you are safe in the face of disaster. </s>

<p n="p6.38">
<s n="s1.3;p6.38">The imagination, as we will later see in Kant, cannot provide a conception of infinity or an overwhelming force or the vastness of an ocean, so to compensate it embraces the idea of infinity or force or vastness. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p6.38">The imagination responds to such pressures actively and positively, almost rising to a challenge. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p6.38">Coming into contact with the sublime has a positive effect on us; it strengthens our powers of conception and, to some extent, our raises our perceived achievements as human beings.<ref target="BAWE_0407b-endnote.004"/> </s>

</p>
</note>
<p n="p7.38">
<s n="s1.11;p7.38">Burke's method of examining the sublime is essentially different from Kant's. </s>
<s n="s2.11;p7.38">Burke undertakes an empirical exploration of the sublime, and is therefore largely limited to examining the observable effect of the sublime. </s>
<s n="s3.11;p7.38">His position therefore seems based on our psychological and physiological responses to objects and events (through our senses), making his theory a scientific one. </s>
<s n="s4.11;p7.38">Using the example of the ocean we can extrapolate: The entire expanse of water is so large that the eye cannot take it all in at once. </s>
<s n="s5.11;p7.38">It stretches the eye beyond its biological capacity, in effect our senses fail to capture the object in the same way that the imagination fails to capture it. </s>
<s n="s6.11;p7.38">In this example there is both a bodily exertion and a cognitive one; an intelligible and sensible epistemological tension. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p7.38">Likewise eternity and infinity are all sublime because they cannot be presented to the mind in a clear and distinct way (neither the senses nor mind can contain them). </s>
<s n="s8.11;p7.38">This shows us the limits of our empirical understanding. </s>
<s n="s9.11;p7.38">The question that seems to remains unanswered after reading Burke is whether 'the sublime' <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the object perceived or the subjective response, or in an interaction of the object and subject. </s>
<s n="s10.11;p7.38">Of course if we commit to saying that what the object provides is a sense of terror, we cannot also say it is the direct source of pleasure and this is something that Kant will later pick up on. </s>
<s n="s11.11;p7.38">We might then have to settle on premise that the sublime 'experience' is the object interacting with the mind, or the imaginations assimilation with the object or spectacle. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.38">
<s n="s1.8;p8.38">Burke's analysis of the sublime is distinctive because he deems that man-made forms of the sublime (poetry, art) can be affective. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p8.38">Writers in the 18 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> century, such as Milton, create a sense of the sublime in poetry by drawing from a sense of an external, hostile force. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p8.38">Words and language can bring about a renovation of the way one experiences the world. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p8.38">The Sublime is: "Whatever is in any sort terrible, or is conversant about terrible objects, or operates in a manner analogous to terror" (1.7 P.36).<ref target="BAWE_0407b-ftnote.003"/> The same cannot be said for visual artists, for although Burke does not suggest that a painting cannot evoke a sublime response, but he makes it clear why writing is much more affective.<ref target="BAWE_0407b-endnote.005"/> Ignorance, the unknown and confusion are all vital apparatus when it comes to re-creating the sublime. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p8.38">Words alone allow the mind to link incongruent things together and create a more chaotic and overwhelming spectacle. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p8.38">It is difficult to make an idea clear and effecting; "To make anything very terrible obscurity in general seems to be necessary." </s>
<s n="s7.8;p8.38">(2.3 P.54) Burke uses as an example the portrait of Satan in Milton's <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>
<ref target="BAWE_0407b-ftnote.004"/> to illustrate the successes of poetical sublime; "The images raised by poetry are always of this obscure kind..." </s>
<s n="s8.8;p8.38">(2.4 P.57) For Burke there need not be a distinction between the sublime experience and its description by talented writers.<ref target="BAWE_0407b-ftnote.005"/> For Kant, as we shall see, the sublime is a product of raw nature, and cannot be re-created in art. </s>
</p>
<note place="foot" id="BAWE_0407b-ftnote.003">
<p n="pn1.1">
<s n="s1.1;pn1.1">Through his suggestion that the sublime is closely linked to language (note his terminology: <hi rend="italic">conversant</hi>) he allows writing and poetry a special sublime merit. </s>

<s n="s2.3;pn1.2">On the other hand the most lively and spirited verbal description I can give raises a very obscure and imperfect <hi rend="italic">idea</hi> of such objects; but then it is in my power to raise a stronger <hi rend="italic">emotion</hi> by the description than I could do by the best painting." </s>

<s n="s4.5;p9.38">Although Kant shares Burkes aim of tackling the paradox of pleasure produced by something terrible, Kant's motivation for analysing the sublime is more profound and fundamental for the rest of his philosophical enquires. </s>
