<p n="p1.15">
<s n="s1.3;p1.15">Firms in perfect competition are said to be price takers, i.e. they cannot influence the price of a good or service. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p1.15">Perfectly competitive firms are price takers because each firm produces a tiny fraction of the total output of a particular good and buyers are well informed about the prices of other firms. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p1.15">However, monopolies can charge whatever they like as they are the only firm which provides that good or service. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.15">
<s n="s1.6;p2.15">In perfect competition, price is independent of the quantity sold and so the change in total revenue resulting from a one-unit increase in the quantity sold equals price. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p2.15">Therefore marginal revenue equals price and marginal revenue does not vary with quantity. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p2.15">Also, the demand curve for individual firm is horizontal, i.e. perfectly elastic, as the firm is a price taker. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p2.15">However, the market demand curve for the entire industry is downward slopping. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p2.15">The monopoly faces the downward slopping demand curve too. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p2.15">This means price changes as quantity changes and marginal revenue will be less than price. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.15">
<s n="s1.3;p3.15">In perfect competition, firm's supply curve is based on the marginal cost curve. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p3.15">The industry supply curve is the sum of the firm's supply / marginal cost curves. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p3.15">For monopoly, the industry supply curve becomes the marginal cost curve of the firm. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.15">
<s n="s1.1;p4.15">Let us see the diagram below, </s>
</p>
<figure id="BAWE_6008q-fig.001">
<head>S: industry supply curve MC: marginal cost curve D: industry market demand curve MR: marginal revenue curve Q <hi rend="sub">C</hi> : quantity produced by the perfectly competitive industry Q <hi rend="sub">M</hi> : quantity produced by the monopoly P <hi rend="sub">C</hi> : price set by the competitive industry P <hi rend="sub">M</hi> : price set by the monopoly P <hi rend="sub">A</hi> : highest price charged</head>
</figure>
<p n="p5.15">
<s n="s1.9;p5.15">In perfect competition, the market equilibrium occurs where the supply curve and the demand curve intersect. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p5.15">Each firm takes the price P <hi rend="sub">C</hi> and maximizes its profit by producing the output at which its own marginal cost equals the price. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p5.15">As each firm is a small part of the total industry, there is no incentive for any firm to try to manipulate the price by varying its output. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p5.15">If the industry is monopolized, the industry supply curve becomes the MC curve of the firm. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p5.15">The new monopolized industry will maximizes its profit by producing Q <hi rend="sub">M</hi>, where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p5.15">As marginal revenue is below the demand curve, output Q <hi rend="sub">M</hi> is smaller than output Q <hi rend="sub">C</hi>. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p5.15">The monopoly charges the highest price P <hi rend="sub">M</hi> for which output Q <hi rend="sub">M</hi> can be sold. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p5.15">Overall speaking, monopoly restricts its output and charges a higher price compared with a perfectly competitive industry. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p5.15">That is why monopoly is less efficient. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.15">
<s n="s1.2;p6.15">Monopoly is a form of market failure and is less efficient than competition. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p6.15">Market failure prevents some of the gains from trade from being achieved. </s>
</p>
<figure id="BAWE_6008q-fig.002"/>
<p n="p7.15">
<s n="s1.2;p7.15">Under perfect competition, quantity produced is Q <hi rend="sub">C</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p7.15">Consumers pay P <hi rend="sub">C</hi> for each unit bought and obtain a consumer surplus <hi rend="sup">1</hi> represented by the blue triangle. </s>
</p>
<figure id="BAWE_6008q-fig.003"/>
<p n="p8.15">
<s n="s1.8;p8.15">A monopolistic industry will restrict output to Q <hi rend="sub">M</hi> and sell that output at a price of P <hi rend="sub">M</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p8.15">Consumer surplus will be reduced to the smaller blue triangle. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p8.15">Consumers lose partly by having to pay more for what is available and by getting less of the good. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p8.15">Some of the loss in consumer surplus accures to the monopoly. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p8.15">Thus the monopoly gets the difference between the higher price (P <hi rend="sub">M</hi>) and P <hi rend="sub">C</hi> on the quantity sold (Q <hi rend="sub">M</hi>), i.e. the monopoly has taken the red rectangle part of the consumer surplus. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p8.15">This portion of loss of consumer surplus is not a loss to society and hence is not a loss of efficiency. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p8.15">It is just a redistribution from consumer surplus to the monopolist. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p8.15">As output has been restricted, the rest of the consumer surplus becomes a loss. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.15">
<s n="s1.2;p9.15">Actually the total loss resulting from the lower monopoly output (Q <hi rend="sub">M</hi>) is the grey triangle. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p9.15">The part of the grey triangle above P <hi rend="sub">C</hi> is the loss of consumer surplus and the part of the triangle below P <hi rend="sub">C</hi> is a loss to the producer (a loss of producer surplus <hi rend="sup">2</hi>). </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.15">
<s n="s1.2;p10.15">The grey triangle, which measures the total loss of both consumer and producer surplus, is called the deadweight loss. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p10.15">Deadweight loss measures the loss of allocative efficiency as the reduction in consumer and producer surplus resulting from a restriction of output below its efficient level. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.15">
<s n="s1.5;p11.15">A monopoly's reduced output and higher price results in the monopoly capturing some of the consumer surplus. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p11.15">It also results in the elimination of the producer and the consumer surplus on the output that a competitive industry would have produced but that the monopoly does not. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p11.15">Deadweight loss measures the degree of market failure or allocative inefficiency created by a monopoly. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p11.15">Usually a monopoly will produces an output below that at which average total cost is at a minimum. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p11.15">However, even the monopoly really does so, consumers still do not have the opportunity of buying the good at that price. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.15">
<s n="s1.7;p12.15">There is a possibility that a monopoly will not produce any deadweight loss. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p12.15">That is the time when the monopoly is perfectly price discriminating. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p12.15">The more perfectly the monopoly can price discriminate, the closer its output gets to the competitive output. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p12.15">If a monopoly can perfectly price discriminate, it will charge a different prices to different consumers according to their willingness to pay on each unit sold. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p12.15">The monopoly can also increase the quantity of output to exactly the same as the perfectly competitive industry. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p12.15">When the monopoly perfectly price discriminates, its marginal revenue curve is the same as the demand curve. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p12.15">The last item sold will cost P <hi rend="sub">C</hi> which is the same as its marginal cost. </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.15">
<s n="s1.1;p13.15">
<hi rend="sup">1</hi> The difference between the value of a good and its price is consumer surplus. </s>
