<s n="s1.3;p21.75">A sprained ankle is a common inversion injury with twisting of the weight bearing foot. </s>

<item>the calcaneofibular ligament (a round cord). </item>
</list>
<p n="p22.75">
<s n="s1.5;p22.75">During an inversion injury the fibres of the anterior talofibular ligament are the first to be damaged, as they are the weakest component. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p22.75">The mechanism of <name type="other"/>'s injury would suggest damage to the lateral aspect of the ankle joint as this was described as being the site of most severe pain and swelling immediately after the injury. <name type="other"/> may have sustained a strain or tearing injury to his lateral ligament. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p22.75">On examination, a ligament is more likely to be a strained if bruising is light and torn if bruising is severe. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p22.75">The anterior talofibular ligament extends anteromedially from the lateral malleolus to the neck of the talus. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p22.75">On examination pain may therefore be felt over the anterior part of the ankle joint where the ligament has its attachment. </s>
</p>
<p n="p23.75">
<s n="s1.5;p23.75">In severe sprains following an inversion injury, the lateral malleolus of the fibula may also be fractured. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p23.75">This is supported by the fact that <name type="other"/> felt unable to weight bear on the limb immediately after the injury. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p23.75">The Ottawa ankle rules suggest that if the patient is unable to weight bear immediately after the injury or at the time of x-ray, there is an increased risk of a clinically significant fracture and an unstable injury. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p23.75">However this is not diagnostic. </s>

<p n="p67.75">
<s n="s1.6;p67.75">
<name type="other"/> should be encouraged to rest the ankle in order to reduce any further damage. <name type="other"/> should also aim to elevate the leg above the level of the heart and use ice indirectly (i.e. wrapped in a towel) over the ankle joint in order to reduce the swelling. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p67.75">Many of the problems associated with ankle injuries are due to the presence of blood and oedema in and around the joint. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p67.75">This restricts the range of motion of the joint and can act as an irritant causing excessive synovial reaction. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p67.75">As well as ice, compression and elevation, it is important for the <name type="other"/> to avoid factors which will promote blood flow and swelling, e.g. hot showers, heat rubs, alcohol, excessive weight bearing. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p67.75">After <name type="other"/> is seen in the follow up clinic he should be encouraged to aid his rehabilitation at home by performing calf stretching and strengthening exercises and exercising the range of movement of the ankle joint. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p67.75">As the fibula is involved in maintaining the stability of the ankle joint, balance training and proprioception are also an important part of rehabilitation. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p69.75">The ankle is a weight bearing joint which can withstand forces of up to five times an individuals body weight during walking and running [1]. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p69.75">The fibula itself bears up to 1/6/ individual's body weight. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p69.75">Ankle ligament injuries occur frequently and if associated with fractures have a prolonged healing period [1]. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p69.75">Management of fractures can be divided into operative and non-operative. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p69.75">The choice between the two depends on the type of fracture, its stability and the patients age. </s>
</p>
<p n="p70.75">
<s n="s1.4;p70.75">The fracture is classified as being stable or unstable - a stable fracture requires minimal splinting whereas an unstable fracture may require reduction and internal fixation. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p70.75">Fractures above the level of the tibial plafond are assumed to include an injury to the syndesmosis. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p70.75">These fractures are very unstable and a syndesmosis screw is usually required to stabilise the injury. </s>

<s n="s2.5;p71.75">The fracture was not displaced and was therefore classified as stable. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p71.75">In the past such fractures have been managed using casts or braces. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p71.75">However, it is now thought that unconstrained movements of an isolated lateral malleolus injury do not lead to abnormal joint kinetics. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p71.75">Therefore, many of these fractures are now managed without a cast and with immediate weight bearing when comfortable for the patient. </s>
</p>
<p n="p72.75">
<s n="s1.6;p72.75">A comparison of two conservative methods of treatment for isolated SE II fractures of the lateral malleolus showed that treatment consisting of immediate weight-bearing and mobilisation resulted in earlier rehabilitation than 4 weeks immobilisation in a plaster cast [2]. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p72.75">The same study found that there were no reported complications associated with early mobilisation of the SE II fractures and no difference in the pain experienced by the two groups [2]. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p72.75">These findings were supported by another study in which patients were treated with an elastic bandage and immediate weight bearing [3]. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p72.75">However, both studies contained groups of a small size and so further evidence is needed to confirm such findings. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p72.75">Early mobilisation reduces muscle wasting in the leg promoting a quicker recovery. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p72.75">The fracture should be reviewed and x-rayed after a few weeks to ensure the fracture has not become displaced. </s>

<s n="s3.5;p73.75">It is important to explain to the patient the reason why the fracture does not require a cast. </s>
