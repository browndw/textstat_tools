<head rend="bold italic">Introduction</head>
<p n="p1.46">
<s n="s1.5;p1.46">Hannah Arendt is one of the most original thinkers of our modern age. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p1.46">She was born into a middle-class Jewish family in Germany in the beginning of the 20 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> century. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p1.46">Exhibiting a strong passion and sensitive insight into intellectual activities at an early age, she studied philosophy under two most influential modern philosophers, Jaspers and Heidegger. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p1.46">During World War II, being a Jewish woman, she suffered from Nazi-German's anti-Semitism and was once sent into prison for a short time. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p1.46">She managed to escape to the States in 1941 and spent the rest of her life there. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.46">
<s n="s1.6;p2.46">These life experiences have unavoidably diverted her attention from pure theoretical and philosophical activities to practical area of politics. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p2.46">In <hi rend="italic">The Origins of Totalitarianism</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Eichmann in Jerusalem</hi>, Arendt answered the puzzling question, for all those who suffered and survived World War II, how is totalitarian domination and evil of both Nazism and Stalinism possible in the modern age. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p2.46">Without doubt is Arendt a great writer with extraordinary literary talent. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p2.46">Unlike most of the German scholars, her style is articulate, imaginative and passionate. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p2.46">However, judged from the standard of traditional political philosophical writing, these two studies have far more empirical facts than theoretical construction, and therefore are not so significant in terms of theory of political philosophy. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p2.46">Nevertheless, we could find some clues to her "hidden continent of thought" in <hi rend="italic">Between Past and Future</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Human Condition</hi>, in which she developed her most important concept of political "action". </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.46">
<s n="s1.4;p3.46">Arendt found the archetype of "action" in speech and action in the political arena of Greek polis: being seen and heard by one's peers. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p3.46">However, many of Arendt's critics argued that it is unjustified for Arendt to graft "action" onto the modern society. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p3.46">Arendt has ignored the conditions of "action" in ancient Greek: a small and comparatively homogeneous population and slave economy, which is non-existent in the modern society. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p3.46">According to them, Arendt's concept of action is no more than the dream of a philosopher and nostalgia of the irretrievable past, without much relevance to modern politics. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.46">
<s n="s1.3;p4.46">This essay starts with the question whether Arendt is a modern thinker or an anachronism. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p4.46">By examining "labor", "work", "action" with her theory of concept of history and comparing her with Marx, the essay attempt to show that not only is Arendt one of the most creative and original thinkers in the area of political philosophy, but she also belongs to the modern age. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p4.46">Her writings are firmly rooted in the modern condition; dealing with the problems only arising in the modern age; giving her solution to the predicament of human in a new and unprecedented way. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.46">
<s n="s1.6;p5.46">In the first section, Arendt's concepts of labor, work and action are introduced. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p5.46">I attempt to show these three are historical structure as the interrelation between them and between <hi rend="italic">vita activa</hi> and <hi rend="italic">vita contemplative</hi> depends on the particular historical settings. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p5.46">The next section continues the discussion of Arendt's identification of a modern historical consciousness and its break with tradition, under which Arendt's hierarchy, labor, work and action comes into being. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p5.46">The historiography of early Greek, Plato, Hegel-Marxian and their corresponding interrelation with politics will be discussed. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p5.46">In the next section, Bradshaw's interpretation of Arendt's "labor", "work" and "action" will be introduced and critically analyzed. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p5.46">Finally, by comparing and contrasting labor/action and alienation/world-alienation between Marx and Arendt, I point out that their theories are not necessarily antithetical but complementary. </s>
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold italic">Labor, Work and Action</head>
<p n="p6.46">
<s n="s1.5;p6.46">According to Suchting, the phrase "the human condition" was borrowed from Montaigne, whose age, "like our own, was characterized by rapid and fundamental changes in every sphere of life. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p6.46">It is in such periods, when the traditional, customary framework of principles, implicit and explicit, is no longer able to provide an unquestioned orientation for thought and action". </s>
<s n="s3.5;p6.46">(Suchting, 1962: 47) In one word, "the human condition" signifies an opening-up of a new historical epoch and its departure from the history and the tradition. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p6.46">Another more important reason for using this phrase is that it stresses the conditions under which human beings lead their life. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p6.46">As long as they stay on the earth, they are conditioned not only by the law of nature, biological process of their body, but also by some self-made process to a more and more considerable extent. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.46">
<s n="s1.8;p7.46">Arendt designates three fundamental human activities under the term <hi rend="italic">vita activa</hi>: labor, work and action. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p7.46">Each of them "corresponds to one of the basic conditions under which life on earth has been given to man". </s>
<s n="s3.8;p7.46">(1958: 7) Labor is human's metabolism with nature. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p7.46">It is the most natural and spontaneous category of <hi rend="italic">vita activa</hi>. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p7.46">All the products of labor are consumed immediately, leaving no long-lasting end-product behind. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p7.46">"Work provides an 'artificial' world of things, distinctly different from all natural surroundings." </s>
<s n="s7.8;p7.46">(Arendt, 1958: 7) Action is most "human" activity among the three, which is highly related with another concept of plurality: living among man, being seen and heard by one's peers. "...it is only in acting that a man defines himself, by making his essence into a tangible reality in the form of deeds" before the audience. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p7.46">(O'Sullivan, 1976: 231) </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.46">
<s n="s1.4;p8.46">Obviously, these three activities are not of same weight in Arendt's scale. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p8.46">"Labor, work, and action are not merely different forms of activity but comprise a scale in which each marks the achievement of a progressively higher level of consciousness." </s>
<s n="s3.4;p8.46">(O'Sullivan, 1976: 229) Whether the scale is level of self-consciousness is problematic or not, in Arendt's hierarchy, labor is at the bottom, which is bound up with human's biological needs and dictated by the law of nature. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p8.46">And action is the highest achievement of human beings. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.46">
<s n="s1.6;p9.46">The differences between labor/work and work/action need to be closely analyzed here. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p9.46">Ring pointed out that "The distinction between work and labor centers upon what each activity produces, rather than the experiences of production itself." </s>
<s n="s3.6;p9.46">(1989: 435) His reason is that the labor's product is the most perishable stuff, such as food, while work produces cloth for example, which lasts longer than food, and is therefore more stable and secure. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p9.46">Therefore, "The distention between work and labor is objective, rather than subjective." </s>
<s n="s5.6;p9.46">(1989: 435) His interpretation is illuminating, but he ignores work, in Arendt's terms, is a category of human activity with higher self-consciousness. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p9.46">In other words, technically speaking, making clothes may be no more complicated than growing crops, but it does take into account more human elements besides the uncontrollable natural conditions. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.46">
<s n="s1.1;p10.46">On the other hand, </s>
</p>
<quote lang="English">Fabrication is distinguished from action in that it has a definite beginning and a predictable end: it comes to an end with its end product, which not only outlasts the activity of fabrication but from then on has a kind of 'life' of its own. Action, on the contrary, as the Greeks were the first to discover, is in and by itself utterly futile. It never leaves and end product behind itself. If it has any consequences at all, they consist in principle in an endless new chain of happenings whose eventual outcome the actor is utterly incapable of knowing or controlling beforehand. The most he may be able to do is to force things into a certain direction, and even of this he can never be sure. (Arendt, 1961: 59-60)</quote>
<p n="p11.46">
<s n="s1.6;p11.46">It may be problematic to say labor, work and action are positioned in sequence in the scale of self-consciousness. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p11.46">"These categories are not categories in the Kantian sense, i.e. a-historical structures of mind. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p11.46">They are themselves historical structures". </s>
<s n="s4.6;p11.46">(Ricoeur, 1983: 61) Here, "historical" does not mean that certain categories of the three only exist or disappear during some specific historical period. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p11.46">As Arendt made clear, as long as people stay on the earth, they are bound to all of these three activities. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p11.46">The point is that the inner structure between these three and the relation between <hi rend="italic">vita activa</hi> and <hi rend="italic">vita contemplative</hi> depends on the particular historical settings. </s>

<p n="p12.46">
<s n="s1.7;p12.46">What's the relation between labor, work and action in the so-called "history"? </s>
<s n="s2.7;p12.46">In this section, I will examine the historical consciousness in the time of early Greece, Plato, and Marx in order to connect to the hierarchy of the three human activities. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p12.46">Arendt reminds us in <hi rend="italic">The Concept of History</hi> that history is not an independent and self-contained discipline, but is embedded in men's perception of the nature of the world and human themselves. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p12.46">There is no history without the existence of human beings. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p12.46">What's more, "The character of political experience and a specific understanding of history imply each other. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p12.46">In thinking and acting politically, we cannot help thinking and acting historically." </s>
<s n="s7.7;p12.46">(Hansen, 1993: 26) </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.46">
<s n="s1.5;p13.46">According to Arendt, in the eyes of Greeks, human are the only mortal beings in the cosmos, which means only human beings "move along a rectilinear line in a universe where everything, if it moves at all, moves in a cyclical order". </s>
<s n="s2.5;p13.46">(Arendt, 1961: 42) Therefore, the task of history is to save men from the ashes of time, which is taken by poets and historiographers, like Homer and Thucydides. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p13.46">Their writings recorded great deeds and great words of human beings. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p13.46">Action is history itself. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p13.46">The non-philosophical way of remedy to the paradox of the futility of human activities, sets up the example for Arendt, though it is lost and overshadowed by Plato's <hi rend="italic">vita contemplativa</hi>. </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.46">
<s n="s1.4;p14.46">Plato denied his contemporaries the realization of immortality in politics, for in his time, Greek polis was already in the decline. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p14.46">He believed mortal men could "immortalize" in the capacity of thought, in <hi rend="italic">vita contemplativa</hi>. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p14.46">All the earthly affairs, <hi rend="italic">vita activa</hi>, are in continuous flux, and are therefore inferior to philosophical thinking, whose object is the eternal idea. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p14.46">Likewise, Plato's Republic, ruled by philosopher-king, is made up of soldiers (action) and laborers (work and labor). </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.46">
<s n="s1.2;p15.46">This hierarchy, which marks the beginning of the western political philosophy and exerts long-lasting influence upon western political world, is violently challenged by its last disciple Marx. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p15.46">Marx's doctrines, "labor created man", "violence is the midwife of history", "working class will be the only legitimate heir of classical philosophy" stand in radical opposition to Plato's teachings. </s>

<p n="p16.46">
<s n="s1.4;p16.46">"Marx's leap from theory into action, and from contemplation into labor" (Arendt, 1961: 29) does not come from nowhere. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p16.46">Combined with his labor theory, Marx's messianic project is an attempt to realize Hegel's philosophy of history, which regards the whole of world history as one continuous development. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p16.46">"The overwhelming mass of the most divergent values, the most contradictory thoughts and conflicting authorities, all of which had somehow been able to function together, were reduced to a unilinear, dialectically consistent development". </s>

</p>
<p n="p18.46">
<s n="s1.2;p18.46">Marx's break with the tradition, according to Arendt, is partly due to the development of modern science, and is culminated with the emergence of modern technology. </s>

</p>
<quote lang="English">Since the rise of modern science, whose spirit is expressed in the Cartesian philosophy of doubt and mistrust, the conceptual framework of the tradition has not been secure. The dichotomy between contemplation and action, the traditional hierarchy which ruled that truth is ultimately perceived only in speechless and actionless seeing, could not be upheld under conditions in which science became active and did in order to know. (1961: 39)</quote>
<p n="p19.46">

<s n="s2.4;p19.46">In this way, man turns both history and nature into a process, which he could act upon. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p19.46">According to Arendt, it is "the modern concept of process pervading history and nature alike" that "separates the modern age from the past more profoundly than any other single idea." </s>

</p>
<quote lang="English">...in the initial stages of the modern age, man was thought of primarily as <hi rend="italic">homo faber</hi>, until, in the nineteenth century, mans was interpreted as an <hi rend="italic">animal laborans</hi> whose metabolism with nature would yield the highest productivity of which human life is capable. Against the background of these schematic definitions, it would be adequate for the world we have come to live in to define man as a being capable of action... (1961: 63)</quote>
<p n="p21.46">
<s n="s1.2;p21.46">Both Ancient Greek and modern societies have allowed considerate amount of freedom to human action and define man as a being capable of action, rather than of labor and fabrication. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p21.46">But Arendt sensed the danger that in the modern world, action is often reduced to work and labor, which could cause unprecedented disaster to the human society. </s>

<head rend="bold italic">Critique of Bradshaw's Interpretation</head>
<p n="p22.46">
<s n="s1.2;p22.46">In the previous sections, we have explored Arendt's hierarchy of labor, work and action along with their inner structure in Ancient Greece, Plato's republic and Marx's classless society. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p22.46">In this section, I will provide a more detailed account of Arendt's concepts of labor, work and action based on the critique of Bradshaw's interpretation. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p23.46">Bradshaw argued Arendt's concept of action is a deliberate rebellion against the tradition. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p23.46">"She rejected the idea that there is a transcendent object of contemplation from which affairs of the world are judged and the idea that history generates some comprehensive meaning 'acting behind the backs of men.'" (1989: 5-6) </s>
<s n="s3.3;p23.46">In other words, Arendt neither sympathized with the preponderance of <hi rend="italic">vita contemplativa</hi> over <hi rend="italic">vita activa</hi> in Plato's Republic, nor did she believe Marx's paradise on the earth will be realized in the unfolding of history. </s>
</p>
<p n="p24.46">
<s n="s1.2;p24.46">Arendt's concept of action is to defend genuine politics against the encroachment of both philosophy and society. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p24.46">In Bradshaw's interpretation, these two trends are represented by Plato and Marx respectively: </s>
</p>
<quote lang="English">Philosophy is antithetical to politics because it stresses the life and thought of the individual; society is antagonistic to politics since it is chiefly concerned with the common 'housekeeping' needs of men. The juxtaposition of political action to philosophizing and social housekeeping is similar to the contrast of action with work and labor. Philosophy is an enemy of politics because traditional philosophy, as Arendt understood it, was based on the model of work. And society is anathema to politics because it is occupied with the laboring activity. (1989: 13)</quote>
<p n="p25.46">
<s n="s1.7;p25.46">Work is the worldliest activity among the three categories of <hi rend="italic">vita activa</hi>, which builds up the artificial but long-lasting home and objective world for human beings. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p25.46">Plato is the first man to "liberate <hi rend="italic">homo faber</hi> from his dependence on the realm of action" (1989: 15), at the same time he is to blame for the decline of man's capacity of action. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p25.46">"Any application of the model of work to politics denigrates action as a purposeful activity sui generis. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p25.46">For Plato, politics was not meaningful in itself, but only to the extent that it provided a secure place in which the philosopher could pursue his love of the divine". </s>
<s n="s5.7;p25.46">(1989: 15) "Once men began to think about the world they inhabited, they lost something of their capacities, or at least displaced these capacities on false objects and goals. </s>

</p>
<p n="p26.46">
<s n="s1.5;p26.46">According to Bradshaw, traditional political philosophy is responsible for the degeneration of action into work. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p26.46">On the other hand, Marx is wrong "for making the laboring activity the basis of his theory of human emancipation" (1989: 14), which further reduces work to labor. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p26.46">"Once men start to view the products of their own hands as having no other end but to make more products, it is a short step from there to treating all the world, both natural and man-made, as the means to man's infinite making". </s>
<s n="s4.5;p26.46">Labor for labor's own sake, signifies for Bradshaw, "the mastery of <hi rend="italic">homo faber</hi> degenerates into the slavishness of <hi rend="italic">animal laborans</hi>; the objective world declines into the consumer world of modern society". </s>

<s n="s1.5;p27.46">To conclude, Bradshaw connected Arendt's critique of labor with Marx and work with Plato. </s>
