<s n="s1.6;p36.70">All playing pieces should then be placed on the start square, located on the first level. </s>

<s n="s4.6;p36.70">Their next action depends on which square they land on - unless the consequences of that square is that they should not move during the next turn, then they should pass the die on and wait till their next turn. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p36.70">To win the game you must complete the final task. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p36.70">Your score should then be calculated based on; amount of cash, number of programmers, programmer specialities and speed of development (in relation to other players). </s>

<p n="p37.70">
<s n="s1.5;p37.70">Two alternate ways of winning/playing the game are the "last man standing" and "poker" rules. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p37.70">The last man standing rules work by making it so you cannot go down a level and eliminating the last player to reach each level. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p37.70">This way only one player is actually able to reach the top and automatically wins. </s>

<s n="s3.3;p38.70">It will be possible to have the iteration between levels of the waterfall, which was added to the model later on, due to the ability to choose to move up and down between levels. </s>
</p>
<p n="p39.70">
<s n="s1.2;p39.70">On each level there will be things to do with software engineering practises relevant to that stage, coming through in the form of tasks and choice squares. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p39.70">For instance, an example of a choice square for the design level would be whether to use a structured design methodology, which may require you to complete all the optional tasks, or use a RAD methodology which might require greater programmer skill but less tasks needing doing. </s>
</p>
<p n="p40.70">
<s n="s1.2;p40.70">Because there will be things such as chance cards which might pop up and make life a lot easier if you had made a certain choice or performed a certain task, players will get a better concept of whether they like taking that kind of risk in real projects. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p40.70">We will be trying to set the game up so this facet of play really does come through. </s>
</p>
<p n="p41.70">
<s n="s1.2;p41.70">On top of all that we have also tried to take a side-swipe at the business and management side of software engineering in the form of having the programming teams, trading of workers, resource management etc. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p41.70">By having competing teams, some maybe racing to get there first, others maybe taking it slow and steady, building up cash supplies and taking on every optional task, we hope to highlight that there is not right or wrong way to go about software engineering but only possible ways. </s>
