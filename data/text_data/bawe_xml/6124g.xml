<s n="s1.10;p1.20">In human prehistory, the transition from hunter-gatherers to agriculturists represents one of the significant subsequent developments in the evolution. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p1.20">In its original form, the subsistence changes are considered as transported from the Near East to Britain, introduced development of new productive bases, field monuments and social hierarchies (Thomas 2003: 67-73). </s>
<s n="s3.10;p1.20">At the same time, continuity is also observed in the basic lithic industries, utilitarian potteries and occupations of the same coastal localities (Richardsal. 2003: 288-293). </s>
<s n="s4.10;p1.20">Therefore the nature of the transition between Mesolithic and Neolithic period is a major research concern at present (Richards and Hedges 1999: 891-897). </s>
<s n="s5.10;p1.20">The dietary shift from maritime to terrestrial base foods is included in these significant changes at Mesolithic-Neolithic transition (Richards 2003: 31-36). </s>
<s n="s6.10;p1.20">Particularly, archaeological record represents the continuation of marine subsistence activities and gradual transition to domesticated terrestrial foods, whereas the current interpretation of stable isotope data suggests that a rapid abandonment of marine resources in Neolithic (Richardsal. 2003: 288-293). </s>
<s n="s7.10;p1.20">Thus, this essay intends to provide over view of the different results in archaeological and stable isotope evidences for examining the diet shift between Late Mesolithic and Early Neolithic in Northwest Europe. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p1.20">First section is going to introduce the transition theories and models, as well as the study of archaeological material records from European sites. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p1.20">Subsequent section is going to represent stable isotope measurements of human skeletal remains from Mesolithic and Neolithic sites, characterising the complete dietary changes. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p1.20">The concluding discussion summarises the isotope methodological issues with limitations and sample bias in order to discuss the interpretation of dietary shift at Mesolithic-Neolithic transition, and examining whether Neolithic people had marine base consumption, or not. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.20">
<s n="s1.10;p2.20">Among authors, there are variety of the definitions for Mesolithic period, Zvelebil (1986: 5-16) has been summarized the definition as "Cultural adaptations by the resident hunter gatherer societies to temperate climate, with major changes in population growth and the form of stone tools. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p2.20">The economically it is mainly based on hunting, fishing and gathering, and it lasted between 8000-4350BP" (Zvelebil 1986: 5-16). </s>
<s n="s3.10;p2.20">Furthermore, between 5300 and 5200 radiocarbon years BP, the main characteristics of the British Neolithic 'package' appear throughout the British Isles (Richards 2003: 31-36). </s>
<s n="s4.10;p2.20">These are often assumed introduction by immigrant agriculturalists or adopted by indigenous people (Richards and Hedges 1999:891-897). </s>
<s n="s5.10;p2.20">This section is particularly going to represent the major transition theories and models with archaeological material remains, these evidences tend to contradict a rapid dietary shift at Mesolithic-Neolithic transition. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p2.20">In general, there are three main explanations for the transition to farming. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p2.20">First theory is the notion of agriculture as the superior mode of production. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p2.20">This theory includes the demic diffusion model, which is popularised by V. Gordon Childe (Zvelebil 2000:59). </s>
<s n="s9.10;p2.20">The second major theory is based on the notion of population, resource imbalance as relating to the transition to farming. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p2.20">Finally, the third theory is based on the notion of social competition within and between societies (Zvelebil 1986: 5-16). </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.20">
<s n="s1.5;p3.20">Furthermore, the processes for the transition to farming are described in the several models, one of the most simplified versions is wave of advance model by Ammerman and Cavalli-Sforza (Zvelebil 1986: 5-16). </s>
<s n="s2.5;p3.20">This model has been applied quantitative methods from radiocarbon data, which led to produce regression analysis of the spread rate of agricultural diffusion from assumed origin in Jericho to approximately 1km per year on average (Gkiastaal. 2003:45). </s>
<s n="s3.5;p3.20">The estimation of the agricultural arrival in different parts of Europe is indicated by figure 1 (Ammerman and Cavalli-Sforza 1984:53). </s>
<s n="s4.5;p3.20">The availability model of the transition to farming is the process towards the adoption of farming passes through several forms of frontier situations, which occurs simultaneously in geographical space. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p3.20">As figure 2 represents, this framework stresses the importance of early stages in the transition and emphasises its length (Zvelebil 1986: 5-16). </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.20">
<s n="s1.7;p4.20">According to these transition theories and models, the Neolithic innovations, in especially agricultural practice, appear in the archaeological records throughout Britain within a few hundred years, therefore the dietary shift at Mesolithic-Neolithic transition has been also considered as the gradual, 'piecemeal' adoption (Richards 2003: 31-36). </s>
<s n="s2.7;p4.20">These gradual dietary shift and cultural continuity is frequently supported by the archaeological records from Danish Mesolithic and Neolithic period, where has one of the richest artefactual evidence in coastal Western Europe (Richardsal. 2003: 288-293). </s>
<s n="s3.7;p4.20">Ertebølle culture has been lasted approximately 5400 and 3900 cal BC in Late Mesolithic northern Germany, Denmark and south western Sweden. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p4.20">It is followed by the Funnel Beaker culture (TRB) in early Neolithic, dated between 3900 and 3300 cal BC, with the evidence of cereal cultivation as well as animal husbandry (Richardsal. 2003: 288-293). </s>
<s n="s5.7;p4.20">Ertebølle culture is known as an abundant fishing, shell-gathering and sea-mammals hunting along coastal sites, with elaborate archaeological fishing tool evidences (Richardsal. 2003: 288-293). </s>
<s n="s6.7;p4.20">The evidences of sea mammals hunting are identified in table 1 (Milneral. 2004: 9-22). </s>
<s n="s7.7;p4.20">More recently, underwater excavations have revealed the spectacular condition of organic evidences, such as wooden fish traps, fish spears and boats, from the now submerged Ertebølle shoreline (Milneral. 2004:9-22). </s>

</table>
<p n="p5.20">
<s n="s1.3;p5.20">Particularly, these archaeological evidences are often represented from shell middens, basically it is defined as a cultural deposit of which principal component is shell. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p5.20">The study of shell midden has contributed to interpret subsistence changes in Mesolithic Neolithic transition, and demonstrate the importance of marine resources as a substantial contribution to Mesolithic diets (Thomas 2003: 67-73). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p5.20">In Britain and Denmark, the occupation continuity is identified with the evidence of typical Neolithic ceramic and remains of domesticated animals above the Late Mesolithic contexts of shell middens (Milneral. 2004:9-22). </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.20">
<s n="s1.2;p6.20">However, it is frequently argued that the coastal sites were possibly the task-specific camps, and main settlements could be located inland. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p6.20">This perspective has suggested the collecting foods, and removing for consumption at other settlement sites, and this is reinforced by recent excavations, for example, bulky foods have been butchered and discarded to ease of transport at the coastal camps for transport to interior sites (Milneral. 2004:9-22). </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.20">
<s n="s1.7;p7.20">According to the combination of archaeological evidences and agricultural transition models, the gradual shift at Mesolithic-Neolithic transition and cultural continuity were expected. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p7.20">However, the study of the proportion of stable isotope from Mesolithic and Neolithic human skeletons do not support the idea of a slow, gradual and 'piecemeal' adoption, but indicate a rapid and dramatic change from marine to terrestrial based diets (Milneral. 2004:9-22). </s>
<s n="s3.7;p7.20">Thus, this section is going to provide the over view of stable isotope analysis, moreover represents data interpretation of stable isotope studies of dietary shift. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p7.20">Both of carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis have largely contributed to the understandings of human diets in Mesolithic and Neolithic periods from protein portion of human skeletons. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p7.20">Generally, the δ¹³C value indicates whether the main dietary protein from marine or terrestrial sources, whereas the δ¹⁵N value indicates the trophic level of the protein consumed collagen (Richardsal. 2003: 288-293). </s>
<s n="s6.7;p7.20">The basic estimated values for evaluation between marine and terrestrial based diets are represented in table 2 (Richards and Hedges 1999:891-897). </s>
<s n="s7.7;p7.20">However, the δ¹³C values is a quantitative measurement of the amounts of two types of protein that have been consumed, for example δ¹³C values of -16‰ suggest a diet with approximately half terrestrial and half marine protein (Richards and Hedges 1999:891-897). </s>

<table id="BAWE_6124g-tab.002">

</table>
<p n="p8.20">
<s n="s1.5;p8.20">The perspective of a rapid dietary shift at Mesolithic Neolithic transition has been mainly came from the early work of Tauber, who firstly applied stable isotope value of radiocarbon dated human skeletal remains in Mesolithic and Neolithic Denmark, and observed a rapid dietary shift (Richardsal. 2003: 288-293). </s>
<s n="s2.5;p8.20">Tauber concluded that there is a rapid change in diets associated with the introduction of the Neolithic culture into Denmark approximately 4000cal BC (Richards 2003: 31-36). </s>
<s n="s3.5;p8.20">Richardsal. (2003: 288-293) quote Tauber's data in figure 3(Richardsal. 2003: 288-293), although this idea of a rapid shift had little impact on archaeology. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p8.20">The source of error is known as choice of samples from archaeological contexts, using coastal Mesolithic samples and interior Neolithic samples, the sample size of human skeletons tend to be small, and results are confined to Denmark (Milneral. 2004:9-22). </s>
<s n="s5.5;p8.20">Moreover, this Tauber's work is chronologically dispersed due to the absence of applying "marine-reservoir effect", which causes approximately 400 radiocarbon year gap in samples (Richardsal. 2003: 288-293). </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.20">
<s n="s1.2;p9.20">Recently, Richards et al (2003:288-293) have reassessed this previous work of Tauber, and have reported on new carbon and nitrogen stable isotope values and radiocarbon dates from Danish Mesolithic and Neolithic humans, and have been confirmed Tauber's findings (Richardsal. 2003: 288-293). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p9.20">Table 3 and figure 4 represent carbon and nitrogen isotope values of Danish Mesolithic and Neolithic individuals (Richardsal. 2003: 288-293). </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.20">
<s n="s1.2;p10.20">This Tauber's work has also been supported by data from the coasts of southern Wales, the Mesolithic shell middens at Oronsay in Scotland (Richards 2003:31-36), Ireland, British inland and coastal sites (Richards and Hedges 1999:891-897), Ukraine (Lillie and Richards 2000:965-972), eastern Denmark, Portugal and western Sweden, except the samples from Baltic Sea due to its complex history (Rowley-Conwy 2004: 91). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p10.20">Thus, the human remains from these Mesolithic sites have been representing a primarily marine-based diet (Richards and Hedges 1999:891-897). </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.20">
<s n="s1.4;p11.20">However Richardsal. (2003: 288-293) suggest no distinct Mesolithic diets are identified by stable isotope data. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p11.20">It represents complex ranges of dietary throughout the Mesolithic Britain, Scandinavia, and Denmark, compared narrow diet range with some overlap data from the Mesolithic-Neolithic transition (Richardsal. 2003: 288-293). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p11.20">The isotope data are represented in figure 5, individuals are from Britain and Southern Scandinavia with radiocarbon dated (Milneral. 2004:9-22). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p11.20">The complex range of diet throughout Mesolithic is confirmed by the study of oyster consumption, in which introduced Milner (2002:89-95), that the oyster contributed very little to the overall Ertebølle diet, usually less than 10 per cent in terms of calories (Milner 2002: 89-95). </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.20">
<s n="s1.5;p12.20">Moreover, Richards and Hedges (1999: 891-897) also have sampled from British Early and Middle Neolithic coastal and inland sites, include Neolithic tombs, ritual monuments, enclosure, as well as cave. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p12.20">The site locations are plotted on a figure 6 (Richards and Hedges 1999:891-897). </s>
<s n="s3.5;p12.20">These human remains from the early Neolithic have represented no evidence of significant consumption of marine foods after the introduction of Neolithic. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p12.20">However it cannot suggest there were complete change of diets in all parts of Britain after 5400BP. It is significant that marine foods were being ignored at coastal sites, although the importance of marine foods in Mesolithic diets is suggested by the Mesolithic shell midden. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p12.20">Therefore Richards and Hedges (1999:891-897) have been conclude there was a rapid change in diets at least in coastal southern Britain, which was associated with the introduction of Neolithic material culture and the first appearance of domesticated plants and animals. </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.20">
<s n="s1.2;p13.20">According to previous section, a rapid dietary shift at Mesolithic-Neolithic transition is supported by the stable isotope studies, therefore interpretation for the reasons on the abundance of marine food in Neolithic have been studied by Thomas (2003:67-73), Richards (2003:31-36) and Milneral. (2004:9-22). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p13.20">This section is going to introduce isotope methodological issues with the some explanations, which mainly describe the rejection of marine food at European Neolithic. </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.20">
<s n="s1.6;p14.20">Richards (2003: 31-36) has contributed to explain the mechanisms behind a rapid spread of Neolithic-Mesolithic dietary shift throughout Britain by contrasting British and Danish isotope data with two modern analogies: one is the colonisation of Greenland by Danish settlers, and another is the spread of maize agriculture into North America. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p14.20">In the study of Greenland, instead of a rapid spread of European culture into the existing indigenous population, Danish immigrants started to consume the same foods as those of native people consumed. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p14.20">In the North American study, native samples indicate a gradual adoption of domestication over a millennium, instead of a rapid adoption as the case of Mesolithic-Neolithic transition (Richards. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p14.20">2003: 31-36). </s>
<s n="s5.6;p14.20">Thus, these modern analogies could not explain a rapid dietary and cultural shifts at Mesolithic-Neolithic transition, therefore Richards (2003: 31-36) concluded that the possibilities of practicing powerful religious elements by indigenous inhabitants in British Neolithic period. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p14.20">The idea of religious elements has been supported by Milner et al.(2004:9-22), who argue that Neolithic peoples rejected marine diets as part of religious beliefs and myth about the sea. </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.20">
<s n="s1.3;p15.20">Furthermore, Thomas (2003:67-73) have argued that the complete shift in dietary preferences as a cultural prohibition or taboo on marine foods at least in southern England. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p15.20">These prohibition or taboo have been required the avoidance of not only fish, but also consumption of seals and shellfish (Rowley-Conwy 2004: 91). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p15.20">The recent works have revealed the common practice of dead disposal in rivers, suggesting a fundamental change in the relationship between human and the sea (Thomas 2003: 67-73). </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.20">
<s n="s1.4;p16.20">Moreover, there are several issues of isotope data interpretation. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p16.20">Milneral. (2004:9-22) suggest that an oversimplification of isotopic data from widely distributed skeletal remains from Mesolithic and Neolithic sites. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p16.20">The composition of human bone collagen has been reflected by the protein portion of the diet (Milneral. 2004:9-22), therefore do not reflect the total diet of an individual, this problem is explained as 'Preliminary models" which show that a diet dominated by plant-food might includes up to 20 per cent of marine protein without raising theδ¹³C values of bone collagen above 21‰, this would standardly be interpreted as a diet dominated by terrestrial food (Barbereba and Borrero 2004:191-195), therefore certainly do not demonstrate the complete abandonment of marine resources (Milneral. 2004:9-22). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p16.20">Moreover, Thomas (2003: 67-73) has explained the dietary shift from marine to terrestrial foods does not always show the shift from hunter-gatherer to agriculture society at Mesolithic-Neolithic transition, because stable isotope analysis can not distinguish between wild and domesticated resources, therefore Rowley-Conwy (2004: 91) have argued the Neolithic terrestrial foods might be as wild rather than domestic, and the Neolithic population is not easily sustained without a predominantly agricultural economy (Rowley-Conwy 2004: 91). </s>
</p>
<p n="p17.20">
<s n="s1.3;p17.20">Furthermore, the reason why several archaeological evidences have supported the cultural continuity is that there are the significant interpretational differences between the isotope data and the artefactual evidences. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p17.20">These differences are often derived from representing different phenomena, for example isotope data often refers to the dominant protein intake by an individual during the last 10 years before death, whereas the faunal assemblages often refer to the generalised dietary tendency in specific environment over long period (Barbereba and Borrero 2004:191-195). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p17.20">Thus, it is not preferred to completely rely on the stable isotope results for interpretation of dietary shift at Mesolithic Neolithic transition. </s>
</p>
<p n="p18.20">
<s n="s1.6;p18.20">Furthermore, the change in subsistence economy has might been derived from the environmental factors, it is discussed by Milner (2002:89-95), a Litorina Sea regression might have contributed to the dramatic reduction in the numbers of oysters, and led to a shift in subsistence practices to a farming economy, although it is hard to know the level of influence pressure on the oyster in Mesolithic and Neolithic period. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p18.20">However, Milner (2002:89-95) have concluded that the combination of these environmental factors and other social economic transformations might be the result of these subsistence shift at Mesolithic-Neolithic transition. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p18.20">Moreover, the sample size bias is came from less available British Mesolithic samples, due to the submerged shoreline, therefore only seven individuals are dated to Mesolithic and 67 individuals are dated to Neolithic, although the minimum numbers of individuals are hard to assess (Milneral. 2004:9-22). </s>
<s n="s4.6;p18.20">Milner et al.(2004:9-22) have been studied the estimation of total population size for Mesolithic Britain, with assuming a population density of 0.1 individuals per ㎢, and one million of simplicity of estimated population, and seven identified individuals in Late Mesolithic Britain, therefore representing 0.000007 per cent of the total population with stable isotope analysis. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p18.20">This estimated population densities are giving some idea of Mesolithic and Neolithic period, although there should have been population fractionation. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p18.20">Thus, the limited sample size urges caution in interpretation (Milneral. 2004:9-22). </s>
</p>
<p n="p19.20">
<s n="s1.5;p19.20">As discussed above, the complete shift in main diets at Mesolithic-Neolithic transition are largely supported by stable isotope results from human skeletal remains. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p19.20">However, Preliminary model and isotope limitations largely suggest the possibilities of terrestrial diets intake in Mesolithic, and marine foods intake in Neolithic. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p19.20">Furthermore, the cultural continuity is observed from archaeological material remains. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p19.20">Thus this essay hardly suggests the complete abandonment of marine foods in Neolithic period. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p19.20">The dietary shift is considered as more gradual changes, which tend to be supported by agricultural transition theories and archaeological remains from Northwest Europe. </s>
</p>
<p n="p20.20">
<s n="s1.4;p20.20">This conclusion attempts to summarise the brief discussion of the dietary shift from maritime to terrestrial base at Mesolithic-Neolithic transition, with comparing results between archaeological remains and stable isotope measurements. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p20.20">Although it is unknown the introduction of Neolithic material culture into Britain either by immigrants or adopted by indigenous people, this essay largely suggests the dietary shift is considered as rather gradual than rapid and abrupt transition, which is supported by the limitations of stable isotope measurements, sample bias, transition theories, as well as abundant archaeological remains, which tend to support the cultural continuity at Mesolithic-Neolithic transition. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p20.20">Thus this essay mainly supports the possibility of marine foods consumption in Northwest Europe Neolithic. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p20.20">In the future, further experimental investigation and more data accumulation are required for clear evaluation of the complete dietary shift at Mesolithic-Neolithic Europe. </s>
