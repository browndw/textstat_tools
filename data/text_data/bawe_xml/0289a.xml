<div2>
<p n="p1.37">
<s n="s1.1;p1.37">a) 79.5% of sales came from the UK last year (£29.5bn as compared to global sales of £37.1bn) </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<p n="p2.37">
<s n="s1.1;p2.37">b) 30.9% of Capital Expenditure was overseas (£746m out of a total of £2,417m) </s>

</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<p n="p4.37">
<s n="s1.1;p4.37">Tesco Personal Finance made £202m, £101m of that is Tesco's share, with the other 50% going to the Joint Venture partner, RBS </s>
</p>
</div2>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">Question 3</head>
<p n="p5.37">
<s n="s1.2;p5.37">Currently, Barclays Bank PLC hold almost 271m shares, 3.48% of the company. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p5.37">It is also worth noting that employees and directors hold significant shares and share options - although not enough to warrant disclosure as the total amount does not come to more than 3% of the company </s>
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">Question 4</head>
<div2>
<p n="p6.37">
<s n="s1.1;p6.37">The auditors are PriceWaterhouse Coopers </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<p n="p7.37">
<s n="s1.1;p7.37">The auditors gave an unqualified approval of the accounts, giving the company a clean bill of health </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<p n="p8.37">
<s n="s1.1;p8.37">The auditors were paid £1.7m for the statutory audit, £0.4m for other audit related services and £2.0m for non-audit services, a total of £4.1m for the year </s>
</p>
</div2>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">Question 5</head>
<p n="p9.37">
<s n="s1.1;p9.37">Total net debt decreased by £248m (6.5%) between the 2004 (restated) accounts and the 2005 accounts </s>
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">Question 6</head>
<p n="p10.37">
<s n="s1.3;p10.37">The implication is that the balance sheet is prepared conservatively, in line with accounting conventions. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p10.37">It also implies that the actual balance sheet is stronger than the reported balance sheet. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p10.37">Had the company needed to strengthen the balance sheet it could have revalued the properties and included their current market values, however given the financial strength of the company this does not seem to be necessary - and means that should the company need to strengthen the accounts at a later stage this could be a way to do it </s>
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">Question 7</head>
<div2>
<p n="p11.37">
<s n="s1.4;p11.37">First impressions of the company based on the accounts are that it is doing extremely well. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p11.37">Retail is currently a touch marketplace and to report these kinds of results mean that the company is significantly outperforming the market and improving on last year - in fact it is leading the sector. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p11.37">Comparing 2004 to 2005 continuing operations, and also comparing to the 53 week year in 2004 which will mean that the figures are conservative - Sales rose from £33.5bn to £37bn and profit increased by £222m and both profit and retained profit showed healthy increases. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p11.37">EPS and DEPS both increased and dividend cover increased from 2.38 to 2.42 times. </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<p n="p12.37">
<s n="s1.1;p12.37">Specifically on the figures, again comparing 2004 (53 weeks) to 2005 to ensure all figures can be compared on the same basis: </s>
</p>
<list type="ordered">
<item>Sales +10.5%</item>
<item>Gross Profit (PBIT) +22.6% </item>
<item>Operating profit +12.3%</item>
<item>Profit for the year +24.1%</item>
<item>Retained Profit +33.4%</item>
<item>Dividends +13.8%</item>
<item>EPS +17.8%</item>
<item>Underlying EPS +12.6%</item>
<item>Underlying undiluted EPS +12.2%</item>
</list>
</div2>
<div2>
<p n="p13.37">
<s n="s1.2;p13.37">The share price performance during the year was good - an increase of 17.8% on earnings per share, with underlying undiluted EPS rising by 12.2%. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p13.37">The share price itself rose from circa 250p at the start of the financial year to circa 320p at the end, with the main increase coming from the August 2004 - February 2005 period. </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<p n="p14.37">
<s n="s1.3;p14.37">Directors pay in total decreased by 24%; however this was due to 2 retirements of highly paid Executive Directors during the year. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p14.37">As an example, the CEO's pay increased by 7.2%, and this was broadly reflected in the increase in packages of the other Directors. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p14.37">This is significantly less than the increase in performance so the Directors cannot be accused of receiving pay for poor performance - quite the opposite in fact </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<p n="p15.37">
<s n="s1.2;p15.37">Pension values increased significantly, again taking the CEO as an example, the value of his pension fund increased the 21.7%, again broadly reflective of the other Directors. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p15.37">Again however, this does not seem to be hugely out of kilter with company performance, and is most likely to be due to an improved investment performance in the year </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<p n="p16.37">
<s n="s1.3;p16.37">The executive incentive scheme seems to be in line with good corporate governance procedure. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p16.37">Pay is heavily geared to performance, with 60-80% of total remuneration dependent on short and long term performance and specific targets set. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p16.37">This does mean that the executives have a large number of shares and share options in their packages but given the structure of remuneration and company performance this does not seem excessive and compares well with the employee schemes, SAYE (which the Directors are also part of) and Shares in Success, in which £65m (+14%) was allocated. </s>
</p>
</div2>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">Question 8</head>
<div2>
<p n="p17.37">
<s n="s1.1;p17.37">Average FTE pay was £12,713 to nearest £, +6.8%, based on total global employees </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<p n="p18.37">
<s n="s1.1;p18.37">Average FTE cost was £14,544 to nearest £, +9.3% on the same basis, the difference being the cost of social security and pensions.√ </s>

<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">Question 9</head>
<div2>
<p n="p19.37">
<s n="s1.1;p19.37">At the UK level, average store size has risen by 14.6% over the past 5 years (31,677 sq ft from 27,636 sq ft), fairly steady increments over the period </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<p n="p20.37">
<s n="s1.2;p20.37">At the UK level, weekly sales per sq ft have risen 9.8% or £2.14 from £21.75 to £23.89 over the 5 year period. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p20.37">This rise was less steady, with a dip in 2003 and the lions share of the increase (£1.41) being between 2004 and 2005-09-19 </s>
