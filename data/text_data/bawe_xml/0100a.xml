<s n="s1.8;p1.18">Various properties of enzymes were investigated in this class. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p1.18">Enzyme activity is affected by factors such as pH, temperature, cofactors, inhibitors, etc. pH and high temperatures changes the structure of enzymes and therefore their ability to bind with the substrate. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p1.18">Low temperatures do not provide enough energy to drive the reaction. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p1.18">The optimum pH and temperature of alkaline phosphatase are pH 9.0 and 50° respectively. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p1.18">The Michaelis-Menten constant was determined by measuring the rate of reaction using different concentrations of substrate. </s>

<s n="s1.9;p2.18">Compartmentalisation plays a significant role in increasing the efficiency of a cell. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p2.18">Apart from providing membranes for embedment of enzymes, different environments are created for different enzymes to work at their maximum efficiency. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p2.18">Different enzymes work at different optimum temperatures and pHs. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p2.18">Most enzymes work best at 37°, which is the normal temperature of human body. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p2.18">Around the optimum temperature, enzyme activity increases with temperature, but decreases as it reaches a certain point, this is when the hydrogen bonds in the enzyme is broken and it starts to denature. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p2.18">The enzyme will show no activity at all when it is totally denatured. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p2.18">When the temperature decreases, the activity of enzyme decreases as there is insufficient kinetic energy to drive the reaction. pH plays an important role in enzymes, for example, enzymes in the gut cannot function in the ileum due to extreme differences in pHs. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p2.18">Enzymes in the gut will have a low optimum pH and will be denatured by the alkaline environment in the ileum. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p2.18">This is because pH affects the hydrogen bonds, disulphide bonds and the hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions. </s>

<s n="s4.5;p3.18">P-nitrophenol is yellow in alkaline pHs, whereas the others are colourless, therefore the rate of reaction could be calculated from the absorbance of the reaction mixture. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p3.18">To ensure that the mixture is alkaline enough, sodium hydroxide is added in the end of the reaction, it can also stop the reaction by denaturing the enzyme. </s>
