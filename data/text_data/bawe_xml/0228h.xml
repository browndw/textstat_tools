<s n="s4.8;p3.56">This method was refined and a more complicated method was produced. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p3.56">This involved calculating new variables using MATLAB commands. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p3.56">However this produced a line of best fit which fit well through all the points. </s>

<s n="s1.14;p53.56">Graph 1 produced a graph for lateral force data. </s>
<s n="s2.14;p53.56">This was plotted with only the points displayed. </s>
<s n="s3.14;p53.56">The graph showed a linear pattern up to angle 2.5 degrees after which point it was non linear. </s>
<s n="s4.14;p53.56">This meant that when the tyre is cornering after it turns more than 2.5 degrees the lateral force on the tyre increases in a non linear fashion. </s>
<s n="s5.14;p53.56">Graph 3 highlights the linear part of the data. </s>
<s n="s6.14;p53.56">During this stage as the slip angle increases the lateral forces also increase at the same rate. </s>
<s n="s7.14;p53.56">When the cornering stiffness was increased the gradient of the linear line also increased. </s>
<s n="s8.14;p53.56">When the cornering stiffness decreased the gradient part of the linear line also decreased. </s>
<s n="s9.14;p53.56">This shows that the cornering stiffness is directly related to the gradient of the linear line. </s>
<s n="s10.14;p53.56">But once the slip angle is greater than 2.5 degrees the cornering stiffness has a different effect. </s>
<s n="s11.14;p53.56">In graph 5 it can be seen that the line follows the points closely. </s>
<s n="s12.14;p53.56">Overall it can be seen from the graph that once the slip angle gets higher than 2.5 degrees the lateral force does not increase much. </s>
<s n="s13.14;p53.56">It can also be shown that there is a limit to the lateral force on a tyre of around 4400 N. If required to find the lateral force at a particular slip angle it can be easily read from the graph. </s>

<s n="s12.13;p54.56">It can also be shown that there is a limit to the longitudinal force on a tyre of about 4500N. If required to find the longitudinal force at a particular slip ratio it can be easily read from the graph. </s>

<s n="s4.5;p55.56">Using MATLAB was an easy process. </s>
