<s n="s1.3;p1.23">The issue of domestic violence against women has again come to the forefront with the release of the film 'Provoked' based on the famous case of <hi rend="italic">Kiranjit Ahluwalia</hi>
<ref target="BAWE_0404c-ftnote.001"/> who had burnt her husband to death, after undergoing ten years of physical and sexual abuse in 1989. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p1.23">She was convicted for murder by the trial court and sentenced to life imprisonment but on appeal, she could successfully plead a psychological condition of 'Battered Woman Syndrome' (BWS) wherein a woman, because of the traumatic stress of living in a constant state of fear, may feel unable to escape from the relationship and may resort to violence to survive.<ref target="BAWE_0404c-ftnote.002"/> Her charge was reduced to man slaughter on the ground of diminished responsibility and was given 3 years imprisonment which she had already served thereby being released in 1992. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p1.23">This Paper attempts to critically examine the concept of BWS in pleading provocation as a partial defence to murder and whether it applies to all women or based on a euro-centric notion of passive, weak, fearful, white middle class victim of domestic violence while locating it in the larger context of sexual divisions in law. </s>

<s n="s1.1;p3.23">Traditionally, the defence of provocation to murder has been available in cases where the defendant had suffered a sudden and temporary loss of self control so that he was no longer in control of his actions, as was held in <hi rend="italic">Duffy's</hi> case<ref target="BAWE_0404c-ftnote.004"/> wherein the court observed that a long course of conduct causing suffering and anxiety are not by themselves sufficient to constitute provocation including a history of abuse which induce a desire for revenge.<ref target="BAWE_0404c-ftnote.005"/> Though even in <hi rend="italic">Ahluwalia's</hi> case the Court of Appeal stuck with the 'sudden and temporary rule', it held that the defence of provocation would not be negated simply because of the delayed reaction in cases of women subjected frequently over a period to violent treatment, provided there was a sudden loss of self control at the time of killing.<ref target="BAWE_0404c-ftnote.006"/> </s>

<s n="s1.2;p4.23">However, this principle of loss of self control as the basis for provocation has been criticised by feminists on the ground that it is based on a male behaviour whereby the male defendant suddenly loses self control and kills another person. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p4.23">According to Helena Kennedy, the cultural differences and different socialisation processes of men and women are not taken into account wherein women are less likely to respond to provocation immediately, due to physical and psychological reasons, thereby self defence and provocation being less available to them.<ref target="BAWE_0404c-ftnote.007"/> But the law takes a very narrow and restricted view of provocation based on male categories wherein if the crime is not committed in the 'heat of the moment' and the defendant had the time to 'cool down' then the defence of provocation is not applicable. </s>

<head rend="bold">Self Defence</head>
<p n="p5.23">
<s n="s1.3;p5.23">In BWS cases, in addition to the defence of provocation, self defence could also be forwarded since in many cases, women end up killing their partners either to save their lives or their children and if properly applied, it may likely to result in an acquittal than either provocation or diminished responsibility.<ref target="BAWE_0404c-ftnote.008"/> But this involves a rethinking of the conventional theory of self defence which was conceived as an equal fight between men, of similar stature and strength, where the introduction of a weapon could tilt the scale in favour of one against the other. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p5.23">But in most cases of battered women who kill, because of their physical disadvantage in relation to their partners, they use a knife or revolver or other weapons to protect themselves. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p5.23">This might nullify their plea of self-defence since the use of weapons might imply excessive force and the act of procuring it might be regarded as a deliberate and calculated move and not in immediate response to an attack. <ref target="BAWE_0404c-ftnote.009"/> </s>

<s n="s1.2;p6.23">Also, the circumstances under which a battered woman kills her abuser often do not reflect standard notions of 'imminent danger' since she might strike when her abuser is made vulnerable by sleep or alcohol which might be perceived as unreasonable since the woman was in no imminent danger at the time of her attack. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p6.23">This male view of the law of self-defence, coupled with gender stereotypes, limits the ability of judges and jurors to define a battered woman's conduct as reasonable.<ref target="BAWE_0404c-ftnote.010"/> Aileen McColgan opines that "the test of reasonableness must be assessed in the context of the defendant's own circumstances including the disparate physical size, strength and training of defendant and deceased which would have a bearing on the reasonableness of the force used by her thereby keeping in mind her own individual context.<ref target="BAWE_0404c-ftnote.011"/> </s>

<p n="p7.23">
<s n="s1.3;p7.23">However, the notion of 'battered woman syndrome' has been criticised due to its over reliance on the psychological condition of the woman as 'learned helplessness' whereby she is reduced to a passive victim of long term abuse without any agency to resist or escape from her situation. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p8.23">In addition, black feminists have contended that the notion of BWS is predicated on the gender characterisations which are mostly applicable in a white heterosexist society of women being emotional, submissive, dependant, etc while ignoring the historical and cultural experiences of black women wherein centuries of slavery and racial discrimination have made them actively resist and counter both racism and sexism. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p8.23">Sharon Angella Allard notes that while this theory might explain the reasonableness of a battered woman's behaviour, the construction of 'woman' that imbues the idea of BWS is based upon limited societal constructs of appropriate behaviour for white women and the racist stereotypes and media demonised images of black women as aggressive, strong and violent do not fit into the description of passive victim required by the BWS in order to plead lenient penalty on the ground of 'learned helplessness'. </s>

<p n="p9.23">
<s n="s1.3;p9.23">Allard gives the examples of two battered women, one being white and the other, black, who were both accused of battering death of the children in their custody. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p9.23">While the white woman was let off since she was quite emotionally tortured by her abuser, the poor black woman was charged with manslaughter, hence showing that the treatment of battered women varies in the court, depending on whether she is white or black.<ref target="BAWE_0404c-ftnote.014"/> Moreover, the concept of BWS based on the common gender notions of violent male and passive female falls flat in the context of battering in lesbian relationships wherein both the abuser and the abused are of the same sex thereby allegedly having similar personality traits. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p9.23">Due to the double handicap of being a woman and a lesbian in a sexist homophobic society, the instances of lesbian battering do not come to light and are not taken into account in majority of domestic violence discourses. </s>

<s n="s1.1;p11.23">According to Naffine, while law professes to organise around a universal 'person', abstracted from his social context, in fact the law endows its legal subject with a very specific sort of qualities whereby the legal model of the person implies a white middle class heterosexual man and hence excluding majority of the population including working class and black men from the legal subjectivity.<ref target="BAWE_0404c-ftnote.016"/> The sexist bias of the law is further perpetuated by the traditional liberal divide between the public and the private wherein men are supposed to inhabit the public world of government and market place while women are supposed to be ghettoised in the private sphere saddled with the child bearing and child rearing responsibilities. </s>

<head rend="bold">Phases of Critical Legal Feminism</head>
<p n="p13.23">
<s n="s1.2;p13.23">The feminist critique of law has undergone various phases wherein in the first phase, the present character and outlook of law are largely left unquestioned i.e. it uncritically accepted the impartial and objective nature of law but argued that same principle of objectivity and non-discrimination should be applied to women and they should get equal opportunity in education, employment, property rights, voting rights etc. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p14.23">The second phase of the feminist critique is concerned with the deep-seated mail bias which encompasses every aspect of law. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p14.23">It argued that the law embodies a male culture, a male way of doing things which is hidden by the rhetoric of impartiality and neutrality thereby obscuring law's actual partiality: its preference for men and their view of the world.<ref target="BAWE_0404c-ftnote.019"/> According to Catherine Mackinnon, some feminists have attempted to emphasise the differences between men and women and seek special measures in terms of pregnancy benefits, maternity leave, etc but in this analysis, 'the man has become the measure of all things'. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p14.23">Thus, she advocates the 'dominance approach' in which the issue of gender equality is a question of the unequal division of power, specifically of male domination and female subjugation. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p15.23">Though it exposed the inherent male nature of the law and its institutions like court, police etc, this phase is also criticised for essentialising women's experiences and the whole category of 'woman' has become a suspect since the feminist discourse for long has concentrated only on the gender identity of women without taking into account other intersecting identities of race, class, sexual orientation, disability, etc which equally impact and affect women's social realities. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p15.23">This universalising tendency of the second phase feminism is sought to be corrected in the third phase wherein the analytical categories through which law proclaims to be impartial are questioned in order to expose the disjuncture between the rhetoric of law and its sexist practice. </s>

<s n="s3.3;p17.23">The feminists acknowledge that not only do women experience a higher rate of severe and lethal domestic violence than men but also socially structured gender inequality is a primary reason for the high rate of violence against women, while simultaneously recognising that domestic violence gets multiplied by the intersections of particular race, ethnic, class, gender, and sexual orientation systems of oppression and discrimination.<ref target="BAWE_0404c-ftnote.022"/> </s>

<s n="s1.3;p20.23">Though national legislations protecting women against domestic violence exist in most countries including India where the 'Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act' was passed in 2005, the patriarchal nature of the state along with a lack of political will to eradicate violence against women have rendered these legal reforms ineffective. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p20.23">These laws would be of no use unless they are accompanied by attitudinal changes in the mindset of judges, police officials and other service providers including doctors and para-medical staff who are still entrenched in sexist biases and refuse to recognize domestic violence as a potent form of violation of certain basic rights of women. </s>

<p n="p22.23">
<s n="s1.3;p22.23">I would like to contend that the idea of 'battered woman syndrome' did manage to focus on the differential experiences of women and their way of dealing with violence and abuse in contrast to the male reaction to violence and attack, which had hitherto informed the legal principles of self-defence and provocation as defences to murder. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p22.23">Though BWS attempted to pathologise and individualise women's conditions who suffer years of domestic abuse to a state of learned helplessness, it fell short of implicating the entire social structure which justifies and perpetuate gender violence at every level. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p22.23">Instead of locating violence as a means of controlling power and dominance over women, BWS separated the abusive situation of women from the larger societal structure of male violence. </s>
</p>
<p n="p23.23">
<s n="s1.3;p23.23">Thus, any theory of domestic violence, whether a legal concept to explain women's actions of murdering their abusers in order to claim self defence or provocation, or a sociological analysis explaining the causal effects, has to keep in mind the multifarious nature of violence operating in society inclusive of race, class, gender and sexual orientation factors. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p23.23">The BWS incorporates the idea of 'intersectionality' and pays equal attention to all those factors which render women susceptible to abuse and violence including poverty, lack of welfare and support services, non-access to legal remedies, etc and focus on the entrenched structural disabilities of the patriarchal social order instead of highlighting the psychological condition of survivors. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p23.23">Otherwise it would have limited utility in advancing the cause of the victims of domestic violence like Thornton, women of colour etc. who do not fit into the dominant notions of BWS. Thus, protection for battered women depends as much on social movements for structural changes and social justice as it does on culturally competent services for individual women and communities.<ref target="BAWE_0404c-ftnote.027"/> </s>
