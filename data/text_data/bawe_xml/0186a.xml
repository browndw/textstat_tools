<s n="s1.2;p1.21">An evaluation of the work of the TRC requires us to remember, at the very outset, that <hi rend="italic">reconciliation</hi> is a complex, multi-dimensional concept, and any attempts at defining and measuring the term should, therefore, be approached with a certain degree of caution.<ref target="BAWE_0186a-ftnote.001"/> Towards this end, it is interesting to note Hamber and van der Merwe's identification of at least five different understandings of the concept of reconciliation in South Africa, non-racial, intercommunal, religious, human rights, and community building; these ideologies may comfortably co-exist, but have been at the core of conflict between different groups during the process of the TRC.<ref target="BAWE_0186a-ftnote.002"/> This theory is useful in our present context as it provides the basis of one of the ways in which the various grounds of criticisms levelled against the TRC may be categorised. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p1.21">The dissatisfaction that a particular individual, group or institution might express towards the work of the TRC, based upon its predominant ideology of reconciliation, does not necessarily translate into dissatisfaction with the performance of the TRC but possibly with one or more of the principles that it bases itself upon, such as its use of the language of Christian forgiveness, to name just one example. </s>

<s n="s1.3;pn1.1">Hamber and van der Merwe argue that "reconciliation is a complex and relatively new term for South Africans, and indeed for the world", and thus, "a uniform and populist understanding of reconciliation still appears to be a long way off." </s>

<p n="p2.21">
<s n="s1.2;p2.21">The TRC arose in response to the need to find a method to deal with the legacy of the human rights violations committed within or outside South Africa between 1960, when the Sharpeville disaster took place, and the inauguration of Mr. Nelson Mandela as the first democratically-elected President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p2.21">The process of expelling the ghosts of South Africa's tumultuous past required not only an attempt to right individual wrongs, but also that this be done in a manner that was not incompatible with the nation's peaceful entry into the new era, and the development of its fledgling democracy. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.21">
<s n="s1.5;p3.21">The situation under which the TRC was to work was certainly not devoid of constraints. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p3.21">As an institution, it cannot be denied that it had an important political role and presence, and it was a delicate task indeed to navigate the perilous path towards reconciliation in the midst of great political and socio-economic change, as the nation struggled to find its feet, and as its people became more self-aware. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p3.21">The colossal scale of the work it undertook in its short lifespan is in itself awe-inspiring. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p3.21">The TRC's task, according to the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act, No 34 of 1995, was to broadly promote national unity and reconciliation in a spirit of understanding that transcended the conflicts and divisions of the past. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p3.21">It's aims, as summarized by Boraine, were to give back to victims their human rights, to restore moral order, to record the truth, to grant amnesty to those who qualified, to create a culture of human rights and respect for the rule of law and ultimately, by so doing, to prevent the recurrence of the violations of human rights of the past.<ref target="BAWE_0186a-ftnote.003"/> One can scarcely disagree that "The logistical problems alone of accomplishing such Herculean tasks in so large and diverse a country, facing material limitations and with 34 years of brutality to cover are awe-inspiring."<ref target="BAWE_0186a-ftnote.004"/> </s>

<p n="p4.21">
<s n="s1.1;p4.21">In order to measure the degree of success or failure of the TRC in adhering to its aims, as set down in its mandate, it would be necessary to examine the impact of the work of the Commission as a whole, as well as that of its three committees, the Committee on Human Rights Violations, the Amnesty Committee, and the Reparations and Rehabilitations Committee. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.21">
<s n="s1.3;p5.21">The very breadth of the TRC's mandate almost necessitated a vast amount of criticism from various quarters, including legal challenges.<ref target="BAWE_0186a-ftnote.005"/> One of the most vociferous criticisms against the TRC was the charge that it has been overly lenient in its methods of bringing perpetrators to heel; many feel that amnesty was given too quickly and easily, in exchange for a mere recollection of one's story, and that this amounted to letting the perpetrators of gross human rights abuses roam free. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p5.21">However, as Boraine argues, individual amnesty was granted only in exchange for full disclosure, and was subject to a number of conditions, such as that the offence in question was politically motivated and committed under the auspices of a politically known entity. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p5.21">Thus, of the 7,000 individuals who applied, the commission recommended amnesty for only 1,200.<ref target="BAWE_0186a-ftnote.006"/> </s>

<p n="p6.21">
<s n="s1.4;p6.21">Many, however, are of the opinion that "...justice was traded for truth, ... releasing hundreds of perpetrators (who applied for amnesty and met the criteria) from potential prosecution or the jail sentences they were then serving for political crimes." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0186a-ftnote.007"/>
<s n="s2.4;p6.21">The Amnesty Committee's approach to the notion of 'political motive' as applied in Amy Biehl's case often seems to have the effect of protecting perpetrators of gross human rights abuse from criminal and civil liability, a fact that is, admittedly, often difficult to reconcile oneself with. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p6.21">However, the amnesty clause in the TRC Act was the result of a compromise, and a price was to be paid for a peaceful transition; "It was a case of neither too much nor too little justice." </s>

<s n="s1.5;p11.21">An assessment of the work of the TRC necessitates an evaluation of the various methods by which the state may penalise criminal behaviour, at the core of which there is the much debated issue of which form of justice is 'most just'. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p11.21">It is interesting to note that where retributive justice, generally practiced by criminal justice systems, "begins ... with the notion of culpability and aims at a penalty, involving the infliction of stigmatising suffering upon the offender", restorative justice, on the other hand, "mainly directs its action towards the analysis of the damages caused by the offence upon the passive object of the crime (the victim) so that he/she is granted just reparation.".<ref target="BAWE_0186a-ftnote.016"/> In other words, where retributive justice regards crime as a violation of <hi rend="italic">the state and its laws</hi>, restorative justice regards crime as a violation of <hi rend="italic">people and their relationships</hi>. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p11.21">This suggests a 'straight and relatively unambiguous dichotomy' between retributive and restorative justice, the most important distinction being, in the context of justice in post-apartheid South Africa, that "victims are central in the latter and peripheral in the former." </s>

<s n="s5.5;p11.21">"Perhaps most centrally, adherents of this approach are concerned that retributive approaches will undermine the transitions themselves and potentially lead back down the road to civil war or further human rights abuses by destabilizing fragile new regimes and crystallizing opposition to them among their old enemies."<ref target="BAWE_0186a-ftnote.018"/> </s>

<ref target="BAWE_0186a-ftnote.021"/>

<s n="s5.7;p12.21">Thus, before writing off the TRC's methods of bringing perpetrators to justice as ineffectual (and consequently unjust), it must be borne in mind that evaluations in a number of jurisdictions suggest that restorative justice "offers much greater potential for achieving mutually satisfactory outcomes from positions of conflict that does the standard criminal justice response." </s>
<s n="s6.7;p12.21">Morris and Young assert that "conventional justice is very ineffective at addressing in meaningful ways either offenders' accountability or victims' needs - the very objectives stressed by restorative justice". </s>
<s n="s7.7;p12.21">They argue that restorative justice is a 'better' response to criminal conflict, firstly because "it is intrinsically good, (it treats victims and offenders as valuable in themselves and apart from any system or community benefits that may accrue)", and secondly because "it is instrumentally good (it encourages attitudinal and behavioural change in victims and offenders that benefit them directly, and the system and the community indirectly)." <ref target="BAWE_0186a-ftnote.022"/> </s>
