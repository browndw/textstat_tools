<p n="p1.16">
<s n="s1.11;p1.16">Popularity is often seen as the essence of a president's success; granted few tangible Constitutional powers and dependent upon media interest, he has little to rely on except dashing looks and a jolly smile. </s>
<s n="s2.11;p1.16">Popularity (defined as "being liked or supported by many people"<ref target="BAWE_0302h-ftnote.001"/>) is ultimately determined by a president's personality, and can go some way to ensuring elections are won, economic growth is encouraged, and misdemeanour is forgotten. </s>
<s n="s3.11;p1.16">Roosevelt, for example, is famed for his "fireside chats" during a period of economic turmoil and Clinton's presidency continues to be celebrated by many despite personal and political problems. </s>
<s n="s4.11;p1.16">In the short term, therefore, character determines popularity and hence how successful a president is perceived to be due to media influence and interaction with the public. </s>
<s n="s5.11;p1.16">Yet popularity alone does little to explain the prevalence of presidents such as Washington and Lincoln, whose personalities are long forgotten, in twenty-first century rankings of successful presidents. </s>
<s n="s6.11;p1.16">Nor does it explain why some presidents, whose popularity was high throughout their time in office such as Theodore Roosevelt, are little- known for being great today. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p1.16">It appears that popularity, therefore, is a fickle measure of success, dependent upon "current political issues, differing perspectives on historical eras, and historical scholarship." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0302h-ftnote.002"/>
<s n="s8.11;p1.16">When determining presidents' accomplishments in retrospect many scholars have argued that, rather than popularity, "the bottom line of the presidency is effective governance." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0302h-ftnote.003"/>
<s n="s9.11;p1.16">"Effective governance," however, relies upon one thing; appropriate situations, over whose occurrence the president has little or no control but which he has potential to manipulate using his personality. </s>
<s n="s10.11;p1.16">Character therefore continues to be the determining factor of a president's success, but certainly not in relation to popularity. </s>
<s n="s11.11;p1.16">With long term perspective it appears much more likely that it is the president's personality (which does not necessarily render him popular) which <hi rend="italic">manipulates chance events and situations</hi> which thus determines a president's success. </s>

<p n="p2.16">
<s n="s1.10;p2.16">Despite being dependent upon character and fortune, numerous scholars continue to state that "in order of priority, effective governance ranks first"<ref target="BAWE_0302h-ftnote.004"/>- meaning, by "effective governance," how much legislative success they have, how they treat the economy, use the veto, and so on. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p2.16">Even Pfiffner who writes that "presidential character is manifestly important"<ref target="BAWE_0302h-ftnote.005"/> later concludes that "policy leadership is the <hi rend="italic">sine qua non</hi> of a successful presidency,"<ref target="BAWE_0302h-ftnote.006"/> ranking personal appeal behind both moral leadership and effective governance. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p2.16">Such categories, however, can be seen to comply with a stereotype of what citizens would like to believe the man supposedly "deciding the fate of their country" has the most control over, and over which he should be judged. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p2.16">In reality, however, the views of scholars such as Neustadt who concludes that "we now are... dependent... upon the mind and temperament"<ref target="BAWE_0302h-ftnote.007"/> of the president are more pragmatic. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p2.16">A president's personal impact on the occurrence of events is minimal; once in office, the elected president finds himself at the centre of a mass of bureaucracy, surrounded by many with more experience than him and presented with problems about which he can do very little. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p2.16">Furthermore, the president is granted very few Constitutional powers. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p2.16">Despite requiring him to swear to "preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States," the actual powers the document grants him go little farther than giving him the opportunity to appoint certain officials, fill vacancies and grant pardons- though even these often require Congressional approval. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p2.16">Effective governance is certainly important, but is impossible without certain character traits. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p2.16">Despite some public and scholars' (such as Pfiffner) expectations, therefore, most problems in the US such as poverty and the economy are unlikely to be affected, let alone solved, by one person, however "powerful" he is perceived to be. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p2.16">The most he can do is hope to face situations which can be presented in a favourable manner to the public, hence achieving perceived success despite having very little influence upon such events himself. </s>

<s n="s1.9;p3.16">The president's influence on the economy certainly falls into such a category. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p3.16">The economy is often used when judging presidents' success; Hoover, for example, is consistently derided for purported mismanagement of it which supposedly led to the Great Depression. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p3.16">Quite apart from the fact that it is impossible to judge an administration's effect on the economy until at least five-ten years after they have been in power, it is questionable how much influence any one person, or even group of people, can have on the economy. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p3.16">Often affected by events (such as September 11th 2001 which "severely damaged business and consumer confidence initially"<ref target="BAWE_0302h-ftnote.008"/> and prompted the government to "shut down financial markets... for a week"<ref target="BAWE_0302h-ftnote.009"/>) that are out of the government's control, or even strengthening or weakening apparently upon a whim, it is the most that a president can do to take credit when the economy is strong and reassure or create positive spin when it is not; in effect, using his personality encourage popularity by presenting a favourable picture of his presidency, whilst in reality he has affected very little. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p3.16">In the long term it becomes apparent that presidents have little direct effect on the economy, relying upon chance, or fortune, to prevent a depression. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p3.16">Clinton provides a perfect example. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p3.16">The man who proclaimed "it's the economy, stupid" and was fortunate to preside whilst the market was strong continues to be feted and ranked in the top ten most successful presidents. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p3.16">Today, however, he is seen by scholars as controlling an administration which had a disastrous effect on the financial system. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p3.16">Though the economy may be used to judge a president by many, therefore, in reality an individual can affect very little whilst in power but seek popular acclaim for favourable conditions, and create positive spin on negative circumstances. </s>

<ref target="BAWE_0302h-ftnote.010"/>
<s n="s4.16;p4.16">This is not such a simple task, however. </s>
<s n="s5.16;p4.16">To succeed, the president must often mobilise public support and attempt to "gain the upper hand with Congress,"<ref target="BAWE_0302h-ftnote.011"/> utilising the infamous "power to persuade" which "amounts to [much] more than...[just] reasoned argument." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0302h-ftnote.012"/>
<s n="s6.16;p4.16">Even with a popular or persuasive president, however, Congress still may not pass the legislation. </s>
<s n="s7.16;p4.16">Andrew Johnson and Richard Nixon, for example, found that their heavy-handed approach was unsuccessful. </s>
<s n="s8.16;p4.16">Though presidents may blame their lack of legislative success on a Congress whose majority is not in favour of his party, such sentiment does not always hold. </s>
<s n="s9.16;p4.16">Bush Senior achieved much legislative success "even though the opposition Democrats controlled both houses of Congress,"<ref target="BAWE_0302h-ftnote.013"/> for example. </s>
<s n="s10.16;p4.16">Conversely, Bush Junior should have found passing legislation easy as, for the first time since 1957 both Houses are Republican. </s>
<s n="s11.16;p4.16">It has not been that easy, however, and Bush has struggled to push all of his agenda through. </s>
<s n="s12.16;p4.16">Just this month, for example, "House Republican leaders... abandoned their efforts to win approval of a budget for the coming year after they were unable to bridge widening differences on fiscal policy in their party." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0302h-ftnote.014"/>
<s n="s13.16;p4.16">It is up to the president to create the image of a united administration. </s>
<s n="s14.16;p4.16">Once again, it becomes apparent with long-term perspective that any legislative success is due to the president manipulating chance circumstances. </s>
<s n="s15.16;p4.16">Bush, for example, was able to push through controversial anti-terrorist legislation such as the Patriot Act following the attack on the twin towers. </s>
<s n="s16.16;p4.16">Once again, therefore, the character of the president is essential in working around chance circumstances to paint a favourable image of a potentially unsuccessful administration and manipulate chance events to attempt some legislative (or economic) success. </s>

<s n="s1.17;p5.16">If personality and the reliance upon fortune is key for perceived economic and legislative success, then a president's relationship with the media is of vital importance; perhaps more important than any legislative action he could attempt. </s>
<s n="s2.17;p5.16">Since Kennedy used television to craft his image with the first presidential news conference in Washington's State Department auditorium, presidents' actions have been closely tracked by television, radio and newspaper (and now also the internet). </s>
<s n="s3.17;p5.16">Becoming increasingly hostile and cynical over the years following events such as Watergate, Vietnam and the Clinton impeachment situation, it is important for the president to build a rapport with the media early on to encourage them to present unfortunate news with a positive spin. </s>
<s n="s4.17;p5.16">Though Bush is much derided by some members of the public for saying or doing things which make him appear unintelligent, he does have a very good relationship with the media. </s>
<s n="s5.17;p5.16">Once again fortune played a part, as he had the good luck to enter office after a president whose administration had be berated by the media towards the end of its term with scandals about pardons and the pricey New York office space. </s>

<ref target="BAWE_0302h-ftnote.016"/>
<s n="s10.17;p5.16">Though this may not change the way that the media views his policies, if he gives press conferences early and often, and comes across in speeches as informal and amiable, then much of the (uneducated) public will look favourably upon him. </s>
<s n="s11.17;p5.16">Presidents also tailor their speeches and schedules to suit a media which cares more about the sound bite and quirky news story than in-depth coverage and analysis. </s>
<s n="s12.17;p5.16">At Thanksgiving, for example, the president is guaranteed news time by the gimmick of pardoning a turkey. </s>
<s n="s13.17;p5.16">It could even be claimed that a president could be seen as successful even if he never had a single piece of legislation passed and the economy was in tatters. </s>
<s n="s14.17;p5.16">As long as he was telegenic and created enough interest for the media to write unusual stories, then the majority of the public would not realise as the media tends to focus on sound bites and quirky news clips rather than in-depth analysis. </s>
<s n="s15.17;p5.16">When Clinton was flying to California to talk about the budget, for example, it was his haircut that was the focus of the news bulletin, whilst the budget barely received a passing comment. </s>
<s n="s16.17;p5.16">When it later becomes apparent that administrations are based upon lies and spin, the president can only hope that chance events ensure his presidency is reflected positively, and that the media continues to focus on favourable events. </s>

<s n="s1.12;p6.16">A president's personality and reaction to the media can (or even, in today's society, is certain to) mean the difference between whether a candidate becomes elected to Presidency or not. </s>
<s n="s2.12;p6.16">Though in practice the media may only sway a minority of uncommitted voters, it is vital in order to get a potentially previously unknown candidate recognised at the very least. </s>
<s n="s3.12;p6.16">With advertisements and campaigning costing millions of pounds and sound bites lasting an average of seven seconds (despite once having been forty-five), it is almost impossible for a candidate to get his policies and beliefs presented to the public. </s>
<s n="s4.12;p6.16">Even if he was able to, candidates today appear very similar; even more so than their parties that they represent, who at least differ on moral viewpoints. </s>
<s n="s5.12;p6.16">It therefore comes down to the candidate who can best present himself in photos and on fliers, who can get the media's attention, and who is the most eye-catching in the short sound bite. </s>
<s n="s6.12;p6.16">Such importance is clarified by the example of the Kennedy-Nixon Great Debate of 1960. </s>
<s n="s7.12;p6.16">During the first ever televised presidential debate, the seventy million viewers who tuned in saw Kennedy as a young, energetic candidate whilst Nixon was underweight, "arrived at the debate in an ill-fitting shirt, and refused make-up to improve is colour and lighten his perpetual 'five o'clock shadow.'"<ref target="BAWE_0302h-ftnote.017"/> Though in substance the two were evenly matched and those that heard it on the radio pronounced Nixon the winner, those that watched the debate declared Kennedy the victor by a large margin. </s>
<s n="s8.12;p6.16">When the time came to vote, "more than half of all voters reported that the Great Debates had influenced their opinion [whilst] 6% reported that their vote was the result of the debates alone." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0302h-ftnote.018"/>
<s n="s9.12;p6.16">Needless to say, Kennedy won the 1960 election. </s>
<s n="s10.12;p6.16">The effect of personality on popularity is therefore not only essential to a president when he is in power, but also before he is elected. </s>
<s n="s11.12;p6.16">This is confirmed by the tactics of today's candidates who often attack each others' character through negative campaigning and investigating each others' history (in short, attacking the one tool they are both reliant upon) rather than their policies. </s>
<s n="s12.12;p6.16">Once in power, it is the use of this strong personality to manipulate the media which is essential in presenting chance events positively, thus creating the enduring perception of a successful president. </s>

<s n="s7.9;p13.16">No doubt each president also faced problems during their terms in office- inevitable given their position, but the good fortune of positive historical portrayal (particularly favourable in regard to the Founding Fathers) ensures that the victories are forever remembered whilst the loses (such as Jefferson's unpopular reaction of "an embargo upon American shipping"<ref target="BAWE_0302h-ftnote.043"/> to the threat of the Napoleonic Wars) are gradually forgotten as those who they affected pass away. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p13.16">Substance may have been more important in elections then with very little media to speak of, but today their perceived success has much more to do with a few key victories than consistent achievements whilst in office. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p13.16">Despite being almost impossible to visualise their personalities, therefore, all presidents viewed with hindsight are judged by criteria outside of their control; "chance" events which conclude (or appear to conclude) favourably often irrespective of the president's actions. </s>

<s n="s2.13;p14.16">If a successful personality is understood to render a popular president, then it is almost certainly the deciding factor in elections- both for the power to persuade people to donate money to the candidate's cause as well as appeal for votes. </s>

<s n="s11.13;p14.16">Though Pfiffner claims that "there is widespread consensus in American politics that presidential character is as important as intellect, organisational abilities, television presence, or effectiveness in public speaking,"<ref target="BAWE_0302h-ftnote.045"/> when judging the success of a range of presidents over a period of time personality is certainly, as has previously been suggested, a fickle friend. </s>
<s n="s12.13;p14.16">Not only is "the desirability of many character traits depend[ent] upon the historical circumstance,"<ref target="BAWE_0302h-ftnote.046"/> but personality is often forgotten or distorted over time, particularly when considering the earlier presidents who have less documentary and media coverage. </s>
