<head>Introduction</head>
<p n="p1.31">
<s n="s1.1;p1.31">We have decided to compare the inflation rate and GDP growth rate of Malaysia and United Kingdom in this assignment. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.31">
<s n="s1.6;p2.31">Malaysia is a developing country, situated in Southeast Asia. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p2.31">Its growth for the past three decades is one of Asia's fastest. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p2.31">Malaysia transformed itself from a raw material producer into an emerging multi-sector economy. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p2.31">Growth was driven by exports, mainly in the electronics industries, and as a result, Malaysia was hit hard during the global economic slowdown in the year 1997 to early 2000. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p2.31">Malaysia's main export destinations are the United States, Singapore and Japan. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p2.31">These three countries account for almost half of Malaysia's export. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.31">
<s n="s1.7;p3.31">The United Kingdom is a developed country, situated in Western Europe. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p3.31">It was the dominant industrial and maritime power of the 19 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> century. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p3.31">During the two world wars, United Kingdom's economic might depleted. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p3.31">After the dismantling of the British Empire, the UK underwent a massive rebuilding process, converting it into a modern and prosperous country today. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p3.31">The United Kingdom is a leading trade power, and it is also one of the world's financial capitals. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p3.31">Tertiary industries, particularly banking, insurance, and business services account for the largest proportion of UK's GDP, while industry declined in importance. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p3.31">United Kingdom's main trading partners are United States, Germany and France. </s>

<div1 type="section">
<head>The Model</head>
<p n="p4.31">
<s n="s1.2;p4.31">In this model, we hypothesize that inflation and GDP growth are positively related. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p4.31">This ought to be consistent with the idea that an increase in output would result in an increase in consumption, hence an increase in the price level. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.31">
<s n="s1.1;p5.31">A detailed rationale behind the choice of countries and variables will be provided later on. </s>
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head>The Process</head>
<p n="p6.31">
<s n="s1.2;p6.31">However, before we dwell further into the results of the analysis, we should explain the process that we used in order to get the results above. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p6.31">First of all, we chose the two variables. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.31">
<s n="s1.7;p7.31">He, we chose inflation and GDP growth. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p7.31">These variables were chosen because of the uniqueness of their relationship. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p7.31">Economists have been arguing on whether there is a close, if not any, relationship between inflation and GDP growth. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p7.31">We decided that we would like to analyse this arguments on our own. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p7.31">After choosing the variables, we needed to choose two countries. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p7.31">In order to have a distinct comparison, we decided on choosing Malaysia and United Kingdom. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p7.31">The decision to choose these two countries was based on the fact that the pairing offers us a developing-developed country combination and also due to our familiarity of these two countries. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.31">
<s n="s1.5;p8.31">Next, we collected time series data on inflation and GDP growth of these two countries. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p8.31">The data was collected from the World Development Indicators CD and was imported to Excel. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p8.31">The data collected were annual observations from the year 1961 to the year 2001. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p8.31">We chose to collect the data for only 40 years because we believe that the period is long enough for us to see the relationship between the two chosen variables. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p8.31">This period also includes the years of economic crisis, such as the world oil crisis in the 1970s and also Asian economics slowdown in 1997. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.31">
<s n="s1.2;p9.31">No seasonal adjustment of the data was required since there is no seasonal component in the data. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p9.31">Even if there were a seasonal component in the data (the business cycle), it would be quite impossible to de-seasonalize it since the length of a period in a cycle is never the same and hence de-seasonalizing would just prove to be a futile exercise. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.31">
<s n="s1.2;p10.31">Using the data analysis tools in Excel, a detailed analysis on the data was made. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p10.31">The results of this analysis are given in Table 1. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.31">
<s n="s1.2;p11.31">Scatter diagrams of each country's GDP growth and inflation were plotted. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p11.31">Scatter diagrams show the relationship, if any, between variables. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.31">
<s n="s1.2;p12.31">Graphs of inflation and GDP growth for both countries from the year 1961 to 2001 were also plotted. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p12.31">These graphs were drawn in order to see the trends and movements of the variables over the years, and also the relationship between the two variables' trend. </s>

</table>
<p n="p13.31">
<s n="s1.3;p13.31">Looking at Table 1, we observe that for some statistical indicators, the results from both sets of data differ significantly. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p13.31">For example, from the sample variance and also standard deviation, we can see that the GDP growth in Malaysia diverged more from the mean compared to United Kingdom's. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p13.31">An interesting point that should be pointed out is the distinction between the mean of both variables for both countries. </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.31">
<s n="s1.2;p14.31">United Kingdom had a mean inflation of 6.8% and mean GDP growth of 2.5%. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p14.31">Meanwhile, Malaysia had a GDP growth mean of 2.9% and an inflation mean of 7%. </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.31">
<s n="s1.1;p15.31">These figures weaken the argument that inflation and GDP growth have a positive relationship since the data shows otherwise. </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.31">
<s n="s1.7;p16.31">Figure 1 shows Malaysia's inflation and GDP growth rate from 1961 to 2001. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p16.31">Up to the early of 70s, Malaysia had a generally high GDP growth rate and also very low inflation. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p16.31">The GDP growth rate in that period was constantly over 5% and inflation sometimes dipped under 0%. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p16.31">From the 70s to middle of the 80s, both inflation and GDP growth rate fluctuated rapidly, with inflation at first skyrocketing to around 18% in the early 70s and turning into deflation in 1975. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p16.31">In 1985, there was a slump, causing negative GDP growth and also a deflation of about 8%. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p16.31">After that, Malaysia recovered with a high GDP growth of around 8% and an inflation rate of around 4%. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p16.31">This lasted until 1997, when an economic downturn caused the GDP growth to dip under 0% and the inflation rate to rise to around 8%. </s>
</p>
<p n="p17.31">
<s n="s1.7;p17.31">In Figure 2, United Kingdom's GDP growth rate and inflation were plotted for the years 1961 to 2001. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p17.31">Up to the 70s, United Kingdom had an inflation rate and GDP growth rate of around 3-5%. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p17.31">Following that, the inflation rate started to climb rapidly, reaching around 26% in 1975. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p17.31">At the same time, GDP growth slumped to around -1%. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p17.31">The economy recovered after that with the inflation rate falling to around 14% and GDP growth at 3%. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p17.31">In the early 80s, the GDP growth rate once again sub-zeroed and inflation rose to around 19%. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p17.31">Since then, the inflation rate fell steadily to around 4% level and the GDP growth rate also steadied around 4%, except for the years 1990- 1992, when inflation rose to around 7% and GDP growth rate fell to around -1%. </s>
</p>
<p n="p18.31">
<s n="s1.2;p18.31">In Figures 3 and 4, inflation and GDP growth rate for each country were plotted on scatter diagrams. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p18.31">From the scatter diagram, we could draw a regression line. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p23.31">We also managed to get the correlation coefficient for both set of data. </s>

</table>
<p n="p24.31">
<s n="s1.2;p24.31">From the correlation coefficients, we can see that the results for Malaysia and United Kingdom differ. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p24.31">For Malaysia, the positive coefficient shows that there is a direct relation between the variables, while the negative coefficient for United Kingdom indicates an inverse relation. </s>
</p>
<p n="p25.31">
<s n="s1.2;p25.31">In conclusion, we found that there is insufficient evidence to support our hypothesis that the two variables are positively related. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p25.31">This is proved by the correlation coefficients and also the scatter diagrams. </s>
</p>
<p n="p26.31">
<s n="s1.6;p26.31">There are a few possible explanations regarding this conclusion. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p26.31">One of the possible explanations is that since Malaysia is a developing country and United Kingdom is a developed country, there might be a different relationship between variables. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p26.31">One can argue that this distinct economic background of both countries might result in these countries react differently to shocks. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p26.31">The degree of dependency on foreign trade of these two countries differs greatly. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p26.31">Hence these two countries might react differently to price changes. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p26.31">A developed country might have a bigger foreign reserve and stronger currency compared to a developing country. </s>
</p>
<p n="p27.31">
<s n="s1.4;p27.31">Another reason that no relationship can be found through this analysis is that due to the difference in the time lag between the reactions of the variables in both countries. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p27.31">The time lag in United Kingdom seemed to be consistent (about 2 years), meaning that a rise or fall in GDP growth was followed by inflation rising or falling 2 years later. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p27.31">However, in Malaysia the lag in the reaction varies. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p27.31">Hence comparing the data of the two variables of the two countries while observing the time lags would be quite impossible. </s>
</p>
<p n="p28.31">
<s n="s1.3;p28.31">An academic might also argue that the Keynesian view of inflation accompanying economic growth should be revised. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p28.31">It is because, in today's world, where the economy is affected by so many factors, a standard rule might not apply. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p28.31">For instance, in this analysis, the different background conditions for Malaysia and United Kingdom lead to totally different results. </s>
