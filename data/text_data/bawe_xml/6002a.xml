<p>2. The texts are used for research purposes only; they should not be reproduced in teaching materials.</p>
<p>3. The texts are not reproduced in full for a wider audience/readership, although researchers are free to quote short passages of text (up to 200 running words from any given text).</p>
<p>4. The BAWE corpus developers (contact: BAWE@warwick.ac.uk) are informed of all projects, dissertations, theses, presentations or publications arising from analysis of the corpus.</p>
<p>5. Researchers acknowledge their use of the corpus using the following form of words: "The data in this study come from the British Academic Written English (BAWE) corpus, which was developed at the Universities of Warwick, Reading and Oxford Brookes under the directorship of Hilary Nesi and Sheena Gardner (formerly of the Centre for Applied Linguistics [previously called CELTE], Warwick), Paul Thompson (Department of Applied Linguistics, Reading) and Paul Wickens (Westminster Institute of Education, Oxford Brookes), with funding from the ESRC (RES-000-23-0800)."</p>

<p n="p2.7">
<s n="s1.3;p2.7">"We unconsciously learned a great deal from nature" <ref target="BAWE_6002a-endnote.001"/>, said Fleming of his family, whose childhood was spent on his family's farm in Scotland, one mile from the nearest house. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p2.7">Fleming inherited Â£250 when his uncle died, and his brother, who already owned an established medical practice, encouraged Fleming to put the money towards the study of medicine. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p3.7">Fleming was one of the first people to administer the chemical treatment Salvarsan for syphilis, developed by Paul Ehrlich in 1909. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p3.7">After seeing the wounds of French soldiers in World War I Fleming contemplated that there must be a chemical treatment like Salvarsan that would help fight microbe infection. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p3.7">He discovered the enzyme lysozyme by accidentally sneezing into a bacterium-laced Petri dish. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p3.7">Lysozyme had natural antibacterial properties, but not against strong infectious agents, so Fleming continued his search. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.7">
<s n="s1.2;p4.7">In 1928 Fleming left a culture plate smeared with <hi rend="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</hi> bacteria, known for turning wounds septic, open; by his next observation, a spore of <hi rend="italic">Penicillium P. notatum</hi> had drifted in from the microbiology laboratory on the floor below and the bacteria cells were lysing. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p4.7">He "correctly deduced that the mould must have released a substance that inhibited the growth of the bacteria" <ref target="BAWE_6002a-endnote.002"/>. </s>

<s n="s2.4;p5.7">His discovery raised little interest, and Fleming discontinued his research. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p5.7">Eight years later a team of scientists at Oxford University lead by Howard Florley directed further research, and in 1941 demonstrated its chemotherapeutic properties and added lots of information. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p5.7">Finally penicillin was recognised as a vital drug, much better than those prescribed at the time </s>

<s n="s2.3;p6.7">By 1941 vast batches of synthetic penicillin were in production that could defeat some of the most common and lethal diseases of the time, such as gangrene and tuberculosis. </s>

<p n="p7.7">
<s n="s1.4;p7.7">Although Alexander Fleming was not the first to describe the antibacterial properties of <hi rend="italic">Penicillium</hi>, he was the first to recognise the significance of his findings. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p7.7">Fleming modestly admitted this: "My only merit is that I did not neglect the observation and that I pursued the subject as a bacteriologist" <ref target="BAWE_6002a-endnote.004"/>. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p7.7">Although his major discoveries were coincidental, those singular contributions have changed the practice of medicine. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p7.7">The establishment of penicillin as a fundamental drug inspired the search for other antibiotics and in the decade after its launch a number of new antibiotics were discovered, greatly widening the scale of antibiotic therapy. </s>
