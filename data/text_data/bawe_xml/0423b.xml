<p n="p17.69">
<s n="s1.1;p17.69">The Tribunal process commences with a repudiation of the normalcy of 'expected' and 'inevitable' delays, inconveniences and lack of funds in a post-conflict situation administered by the UN, and provides a platform from which the Roma can reclaim their histories, future and 'truth' by re-framing their treatment by UNMIK from a discourse of 'mere misfortune' to one of judgment of violations. </s>
</p>
<p n="p18.69">
<s n="s1.1;p18.69">Thus, the Tribunal aims challenge the 'crime of silence' in relation to the health violations of the Roma in the IDP camps and, as a wider concern, seeks to situate the violations within a broader global movement that examines the systematic, structural violation against minority communities resulting from a privileging of other interests (for example, 'development', 'nation-building', 'democracy', 'security' and the interests of transnational corporations) over human rights relating to health and life. </s>

<s n="s3.3;p23.69">Accordingly, given this outlook, it would be beneficial ultimately to remove the focus on a 'victims' perspective' as without accepting shared responsibility, it is difficult to re-claim the responsibility, power and direct space for re-claiming truth, of each individual, which can be focused towards shared goals (representing 'a multitude of singularities').<ref target="BAWE_0423b-ftnote.033"/> </s>

</p>
<p rend="ordered" n="p63.69">
<s n="s1.3;p63.69">(1) The Tribunal represents a supportive public space in which to articulate and create a historical record of the violations, and to highlight the failure of existing mechanisms to address human rights abuses. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p63.69">This re-claims 'law' for the violated community, affirms solidarity with minority communities, and educates the public. </s>

</p>
<p rend="ordered" n="p65.69">
<s n="s1.2;p65.69">(3) To this end, the Tribunal will highlight existing action, consider and decide upon strategic action to be taken at all appropriate levels, with the aim of reclaiming the power of enforcement in terms of acting upon the judgments reached to mobilise world public opinion to invigorate social and political pressure. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p65.69">The purpose of such pressure will be to contribute to efforts to bring the UN/UNMIK to account as part of the overall campaign to put an end to both the impunity enjoyed by international institutions in relation to violations against minority communities, and the privileging of economic or political interests over basic human rights concerns. </s>
</p>
<p n="p66.69">
<s n="s1.1;p66.69">Any such strategic action is likely to include: the removal of all Roma from contaminated areas; the provision of appropriate and comprehensive medical treatment to all affected persons desiring such treatment; ongoing medical, financial and other relevant support for long-term health consequences and any other consequences arising from the delay in rectifying the violations (such as loss of employment opportunities and learning difficulties in children due to permanent cognitive dysfunction). </s>

</div2>

<head rend="bold">The Tribunal as a Process</head>
<p n="p67.69">
<s n="s1.1;p67.69">In addition to any mandated action in relation to the specific subject violations, the Tribunal is a contribution to a peoples' law movement generally (through a recording of alternative 'truths' to preserve against the dominant writing of history) and a practical application of a new political project that rejects the current unjust world order and imagines alternatives. </s>
</p>
<p n="p68.69">
<s n="s1.3;p68.69">It is likely that issues will arise during the Tribunal process that will require further investigation, deliberation and action that may not be finalised within the scope of the Tribunal. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p68.69">The Tribunal process ought to indicate at least such need and call on further initiatives to follow these up. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p68.69">The power of enforcement lies in the ability of the Tribunal, as a component part of a creative global movement for peace and justice, to appeal to public conscience and to mobilise around the emerging truths to create political pressure throughout the world. </s>
</p>
<p n="p69.69">
<s n="s1.2;p69.69">The actual steps to be taken, and the relevant actors to call upon, will depend on the Tribunal process. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p69.69">However, at this stage, it is envisaged that recommended options may include: the agreement by relevant NGOs or other civil society organisations to monitor the situation in Kosovo; the establishment of further tribunals in relation to human rights in UN missions; a series of workshops within UN bodies, and between UN representatives and relevant groups to learn from the violations and discuss alternative future approaches or priorities in peacekeeping.<ref target="BAWE_0423b-ftnote.040"/> </s>
