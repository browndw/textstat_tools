<s n="s1.3;p1.66">This report will critically advise on the proposed Organisational changes put forward by the Operations Director at CFS Insurance. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p1.66">It is the intention of this piece to identify key stakeholders in the proposal, analyse the potential risks posed to the organisation - and strategies for management. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p1.66">Aims and Objectives are provided alongside a project implementation strategy that suggests a new IS provision, exploration of the re-engineering and standardization of processes and provides a timescale for implementation that complements advice on the financing of the project. </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="bold">Project Stakeholders</head>
<p n="p2.66">
<s n="s1.2;p2.66">Identification of project stakeholders is essential in determining the aims and objectives of the project so as to satisfy all those concerned with the success or failure of the project. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p2.66">Here major stakeholders are identified, and strategies for their management put forward. </s>
</p>
<div3>
<head rend="bold">Employees / Trade Unions</head>
<p n="p3.66">
<s n="s1.5;p3.66">Staff were dissatisfied with levels of recognition and work pressure management following the previous changes with the merging of internal areas of insurance areas. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p3.66">It is imperative that this project has the support of staff on an individual basis, and in turn the support of the Trade Unions that represent 60% of the employees (and also have a significant financial stake as shareholders). </s>
<s n="s3.5;p3.66">The proposed changes will affect 78% of the current staff's job roles. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p3.66">With the large influence of Trade Unions compounding the potential affect of a badly managed implementation employees are deemed to have <hi rend="underlined">high</hi> stake, and a <hi rend="underlined">high</hi> level of influence on success. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p3.66">Therefore it is the intention to certainly inform fully with the option of negotiation and possibly participation. </s>
</p>
</div3>
<div3>
<head rend="bold">Customers</head>
<p n="p4.66">
<s n="s1.4;p4.66">The existing customers that CFS provides for will have an indirect interest in the undertaking of this project. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p4.66">As CFS strives to provide 'excellent service to customers...' it is of high importance that this strategic objective is not compromised by the activities of this project and that customers do not remove their 'stake' due to this. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p4.66">The customer has a <hi rend="underlined">low</hi> interest in the project and a relatively <hi rend="underlined">low</hi> level of influence on the success of the implementation. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p4.66">Therefore informing the customer is the strategy most likely to be implemented if needed. </s>
</p>
</div3>
<div3>
<head rend="bold">High Street Agents</head>
<p n="p5.66">
<s n="s1.5;p5.66">With reference to CFS's strategic objective again - '...first-class support for our high-street agents', it is again imperative that a compromise is not reached. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p5.66">The high street agents have a relatively high level of interest in not suffering a reduced level of service whilst the project is undertaken. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p5.66">Whilst this may not be detrimental to the project as such, it could have an adverse affect on the relationship with the company and should therefore be managed. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p5.66">The high-street agents have a <hi rend="underlined">high</hi> interest in the projects successful and timely completion, but a <hi rend="underlined">low</hi> level of influence on the success of the projects completion. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p5.66">Therefore the high-street agents shall be consulted so as to satisfy their needs throughout the project. </s>
</p>
</div3>
<div3>
<head rend="bold">Shareholders</head>
<p n="p6.66">
<s n="s1.5;p6.66">The shareholders will be concerned with the success of the project so as to realise the financial benefits which completion would bring. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p6.66">As the shareholders are essentially investing the finance for the project a Return on Investment will be critical for maintenance of their stake. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p6.66">Therefore any adverse affect on the business through the carrying out of this project will have to be averted, and risk kept to a minimum as requested by the Operations Director. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p6.66">The Shareholders, who in turn shall make their wishes clear to the directors should be managed as a stakeholder with a <hi rend="underlined">high</hi> level of interest in the completion of the project and the expected gains, but with a relatively <hi rend="underlined">low</hi> level of impact on the direct success of the project. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p6.66">Therefore the shareholders shall be consulted about the proposed changes to the core operations of the company. </s>

</p>
<p rend="ordered" n="p9.66">
<s n="s1.1;p9.66">To have implemented an IT System to handle the new, varying, nature of employee work and to attain at least 80% positive feedback from staff. </s>
</p>
<p rend="ordered" n="p10.66">
<s n="s1.1;p10.66">To empower workers in a learning culture leading to at least a 95% positive job satisfaction amongst employees within at least 2 months of the project live date. </s>
</p>
<p rend="ordered" n="p11.66">
<s n="s1.1;p11.66">To have increased the average claims handled per person by at least 15% within 3 months of the completion of project implementation. </s>
</p>
<p rend="ordered" n="p12.66">
<s n="s1.1;p12.66">To impact positively by at least 10% on overall turnover as a result of the higher operational flexibility provided by the new structure. </s>
</p>
<p rend="ordered" n="p13.66">
<s n="s1.1;p13.66">To have altered the physical layout of the office to accommodate the ten regional teams and the life insurance team as individual entities in an environment geared for group-work by the beginning of the undertaking of the new method of working. </s>
</p>
</div3>
<div3>
<head rend="bold">Scope</head>
<p n="p14.66">
<s n="s1.3;p14.66">The project intends to affect the nature of 78% of the current staff's workloads. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p14.66">This change encompasses all areas of operational activity within the company and will require massive effort in terms of staff training, IT infrastructure and day-to-day project management so as to maintain the current level of service over the transitional period of time. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p14.66">The project will affect all areas of insurance except Life, and will require training for all levels of staff involved in each sector to ensure an overall appreciation of all insurance for each region. </s>

<div3>
<head rend="bold">Evaluation Technique</head>
<p n="p15.66">
<s n="s1.3;p15.66">The project scope describes the areas that will be affected predominantly by the changes proposed. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p15.66">In order to determine whether the project has been successful, it is necessary to determine a system by which to measure success. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p15.66">Each of the objectives can be quantified and surveyed using focus groups for the more intangible aspects such as the level of empowerment felt by workers, whereas analysis of sales figures and work-rates will yield the statistics required to deliver a verdict on the success of the other more quantitative objectives. </s>

<p n="p16.66">
<s n="s1.3;p16.66">Despite these individual strategies, there needs to an overall policy for risk review, so as to identify new risks, quantify them, responds to them and indeed to monitor and control them. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p16.66">It is proposed that the risks are monitored by the project steering group at every meeting so as to prepare for the eventualities for new risks emerging throughout implementation or indeed at another point in the project. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p16.66">What follows is a list of the direct risks posed to the project, or indeed to the organisation as a result of undertaking the project, alongside advice on the management of such risks. </s>

<s n="s2.4;p20.66">Management strategy will be based on experience from previous implementations of strategy on operations. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p20.66">Whereas before staff felt their efforts were not recognised, staff will be fully informed and consulted as to the nature of the new working practices and the way that the implementation of the project shall be carried out. </s>

<p n="p23.66">
<s n="s1.1;p23.66">Staff inability to meet the demands of the business would have a <hi rend="bold">high</hi> level of impact on business operations - meaning the work would not be completed at all, or indeed would be completed to a significantly lower standard than required. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p29.66">It is important that CSF maintain the elements to their service that are working, and indeed attracting customers. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p29.66">It is not the intention of this report to send all the employees 'back to the classroom' to learn about the various types of insurance. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p29.66">Instead, the project implementation strategy will concentrate on existing knowledge dissemination, and standardisation of processes so as to minimise the volume of new concepts that staff have to deal with. </s>

<head rend="bold">Project Timescale</head>
<p n="p30.66">
<s n="s1.5;p30.66">The pace of change can be refined when the results of the pilot implementation become apparent. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p30.66">It is the initial recommendation of this report that six months are set aside for the duration of this project. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p30.66">As the suggested change is so large, and affects so many staff, adequate time needs to be set aside to ensure the success of this business-critical project is not compromised merely through haste. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p30.66">Conversely, a project that takes too long can lead to issues regarding staff turnover, higher vulnerability to adverse interest rate fluctuation as well as disillusionment and loss of focus throughout. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p30.66">To counter, it is the recommendation of this report to create a steering group in order to maintain the project focus over the six months, respond to newly occurring risks and problems and if necessary to take decisive action using a 'Stop-Hold-Select-Go' philosophy. </s>

</div3>
<div3>
<head rend="bold">Pilot Phase</head>
<p n="p31.66">
<s n="s1.3;p31.66">Before undertaking such a project in full, it is essential that some experience is gained of the potential problems, as well as justifying fully the true viability of such an organisational restructuring. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p31.66">It is proposed that a pilot study is carried out in a test environment where a group is trained and committed to a particular region, working in parallel alongside existing staff. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p31.66">By carrying out the pilot phase of the project, the following particulars should become clearer: </s>
</p>
<list type="bulleted">
<item>The problems that will have to be overcome in a full-scale implementation</item>
<item>The information requirements of workers in their new roles</item>
<item>The time-scales for implementation on a larger scale</item>
<item>Procedures and techniques for training in IT and insurance-types</item>
</list>
<p n="p32.66">
<s n="s1.1;p32.66">If the pilot phase is wholly unsuccessful then project abandonment is a route that must be considered by the steering group for the project. </s>
</p>
</div3>
<div3>
<head rend="bold">Strategy &amp; Leadership</head>
<p n="p33.66">
<s n="s1.4;p33.66">Existing team leaders are assumed to be in their positions for their leadership skills and product knowledge in their particular area. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p33.66">These members of staff will be core to the training of existing lower level staff members, and due to their leadership skills will be in an ideal situation to share their knowledge in workshops with other staff. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p33.66">These staff will also become critical in the development of a knowledge management system (alongside external consultants) to ease the knowledge burden on existing 'shop-floor' staff. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p33.66">It is also intended to involve these section leaders in the standardization of insurance administration across the various types before the new processes are re-engineered and presented to the workforce. </s>
</p>
<p n="p34.66">
<s n="s1.2;p34.66">It is essential to gain 'buy-in' from the staff that will be affected. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p34.66">Therefore the timetable for training and the work levels that will be expected concurrently must be negotiated so as to ensure the staff members are comfortable with the change. </s>
</p>
<p n="p35.66">
<s n="s1.1;p35.66">In terms of top-level empowerment, a steering group is to be setup to head the project. </s>
</p>
<p n="p36.66">
<s n="s1.1;p36.66">he steering group is to consist of those who have become involved in the process re-engineering (the 'experts' in the new system) alongside senior level support from the Project Manager (chairing the group), the Operations Manager, the Operations Director, the IT Manager, and representatives from select areas of the company as and when they are in anticipation of, or indeed in the process of being affected. </s>
</p>
</div3>
<div3>
<head rend="bold">Employee Support</head>
<p n="p37.66">
<s n="s1.2;p37.66">As discussed earlier, processes need to be examined by a core group consisting of innovative staff members and section leaders so as to determine a methodology to reduce the knowledge burden on the 'shop-floor' staff. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p37.66">A clear thought process behind the new job roles will yield significant efficiency benefits as well as reducing the learning curve required before the company can start reaping the benefits of the change. </s>
</p>
<p n="p38.66">
<s n="s1.3;p38.66">Support for employees is intended to primarily come from other employees and a close knit team that works around one regional leader. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p38.66">The regional leader will be chosen for their inter-personal and efficiency and will not bear any relation to the length of time that he/she has been working for the company. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p38.66">The layout of the office and the new culture of the organisation will embrace knowledge sharing and constant learning in process. </s>
</p>
<p n="p39.66">
<s n="s1.6;p39.66">Finally, IT will play a major role as the enabler of change via support for employees by providing two main interfaces. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p39.66">The first will be a system that allows consistency between different insurance types, displaying only a change in the context of the operation of the system. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p39.66">The user will then only have to be trained on one system to facilitate the various different types of information that may be required for each. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p39.66">Secondly, the user will be presented with a Knowledge Management System, accessible from all levels of user with read/write access for all. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p39.66">This will allow for the sharing of important information so that staff can maintain their learning even when they are carrying out the business processes. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p39.66">The intention is that the benefits will continue to be seen from the changes on a constant basis in the future, not just on the basis of this one major change. </s>
</p>
</div3>
<div3>
<head rend="bold">Contractor Participation</head>
<p n="p40.66">
<s n="s1.4;p40.66">It is proposed to involve contractors in several core areas of negotiating such organisational change. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p40.66">It is assumed that development knowledge for systems such as ERP and KMS do not exist within the IT department at present. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p40.66">As such it is recommended that ERP does not necessarily need to be created from scratch, but an outsourced package from a vendor should be sought alongside training and support facilities. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p40.66">In terms of KMS, it is recommended that this be kept in-house utlilising 'Lotus Notes' or another such recommended product with support from the current IT provision. </s>
</p>
<p n="p41.66">
<s n="s1.2;p41.66">As processes need to be standardized for the learning curve reduction discussed earlier, it is proposed to consult business experts externally in order to iron out inefficiencies and adapt a policy of activities that will maximise the workload that can be managed under the new system. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p41.66">This is the ideal opportunity to get the processes refined and correct before staff are trained. </s>
</p>
</div3>
<div3>
<head rend="bold">Staff Participation &amp; Trade Union Involvement</head>
<p n="p42.66">
