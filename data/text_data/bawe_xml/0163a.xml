<s n="s1.10;p2.19">This is a sad question that many of us would be grateful to never have to ask ourselves. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p2.19">But as technology takes giant steps into ever more advanced ways of making life better, it also discovers methods of clinging on to life - however unwillingly a person may want to. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p2.19">So science leads us to philosophical questions that are not something new. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p2.19">Is life truly better than death, even if that life is only filled with unspeakable pain, physically or mentally? </s>

<s n="s10.10;p2.19">I aim to explore both sides of the debate as I reach a conclusion, in my opinion, of whether medical euthanasia is truly defiant of the core principles and values of the medical profession. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.19">
<s n="s1.6;p3.19">Euthanasia has always been a highly charged topic, presenting a controversy morally, emotionally and politically, and the presentation of former human rights lawyer, Lord Joffe's Bill: Assisted Dying for the Terminally Ill has brought the issue into the public eye. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p3.19">Opinion on this subject is highly divided and strongly debated. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p3.19">In order to appreciate the complete argument we should begin with a definition of the term euthanasia. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p3.19">According to Collins' English Dictionary, euthanasia is defined the most straight forward of terms as "the act of killing some one painlessly, especially to relieve suffering from an incurable illness". </s>
<s n="s5.6;p3.19">There are many aspects, categories and sub categories of euthanasia. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p3.19">In this essay we will look at those forms which involve a medical third party, usually a doctor. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.19">
<s n="s1.7;p4.19">Medical intervention into euthanasia takes place in several different methods. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p4.19">One of these methods is the most usual injection of a lethal drug. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p4.19">This is known as active euthanasia, as it is a deliberate act done to shorten life<ref target="BAWE_0163a-ftnote.002"/> and could be voluntary (at the request of the patient), non voluntary (done at the request of a proxy speaking on behalf of a patient who cannot speak for himself. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p4.19">This is purportedly done for the patient's own good) and involuntary (done without the authority of the patient of his proxy. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p4.19">Again purportedly for the patient's own good or to terminate the burden his existence places on society.) </s>
<s n="s6.7;p4.19">The most common form of medical intervention into euthanasia is what has been termed "Physician Assisted Suicide" or PAS. This involves providing the means for a patient to induce his/her own death. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p4.19">This could mean writing or filling a prescription for medications in a quantity large enough to cause death when taken by the patient.<ref target="BAWE_0163a-ftnote.003"/> </s>

<s n="s1.4;p5.19">Other controversial issues are the issuing of Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) orders, where a patient can instruct the hospital staff to refrain from resuscitating her if she suffers cardiac arrest. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p5.19">According to the British Medical Association and Royal College of Nursing guidelines, the decision to do this lies in the hands of the consultant with appropriate consultation of the family. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p5.19">Also at the centre of the debate are the decisions to switch off life support. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p5.19">It is now the doctor who makes the first step in suggesting that life support be turned off. </s>

<p n="p6.19">
<s n="s1.6;p6.19">Should medical professionals be involved in conduct that is designed to bring about death? </s>
<s n="s2.6;p6.19">One of the basic principles of medicine is the precept "First do no harm". </s>
<s n="s3.6;p6.19">Deliberately taking the life of another, even if that life was ebbing away, constitutes murder, both in the eyes of the judiciary and possibly in the eyes of the public. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p6.19">The consequences of doctors being involved in Euthanasia can go in two different directions. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p6.19">To the few who are strong willed and capable of making a competent decision about how they would want to end their lives- but due to illnesses that cause their body to decay- are unable to, the knowledge that a doctor they trust could end their life in a peaceful manner would be a relief. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p6.19">But what then of the weak willed and the easily bullied? </s>

<s n="s1.7;p7.19">Many of problems already being witnessed by the Netherlands which has legalized euthanasia and physician assistance in certain circumstances by its <hi rend="italic">Termination of Life on Request and Assisted Suicide (Review Procedures) Act</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p7.19">One of the most important consequences is the erosion of the relationship between doctor and patient. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p7.19">A physician shall do all he can to cure, most times becoming a friend to the patient. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p7.19">The Remmelink report, a study conducted by the Dutch government into Euthanasia, prior to the 2002 Act revealed that "more than half of Dutch physicians considered it appropriate to introduce the subject of euthanasia to their patients. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p7.19">They seemed not to recognize that they were thereby telling the patient that his or her life was not worth living, a message that would have a powerful effect on the patient's outlook and decision." </s>

<s n="s6.7;p7.19">Dr. Herbert Hendin, M.D., Executive Director of the American Suicide Foundation and Professor of Psychiatry at New York Medical College said that when a suffering patient requests euthanasia, it is a strong cry for mental and physical relief. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p7.19">The assurance of a "caring, sensitive, and knowledgeable physician who can address their fear, relieve their suffering, and assure them that he or she will remain with them to the end, most patients no longer want to die and are grateful for the time remaining to them"<ref target="BAWE_0163a-ftnote.005"/> </s>

<s n="s6.6;p8.19">Research shows that "the Netherlands has moved from assisted suicide to euthanasia, from euthanasia for people who are terminally ill to euthanasia for those who are chronically ill, from euthanasia for physical illnesses to euthanasia for psychological distress, and from voluntary euthanasia to involuntary euthanasia (called "termination of the patient without explicit request"). <ref target="BAWE_0163a-ftnote.007"/> </s>

<s n="s1.11;p16.19">Whether it is the sanctity of life or the sanctity of the quality of life is a debate that will haunt the subject of euthanasia for a long while to come. </s>
<s n="s2.11;p16.19">The topic will always be opposed by pro life, religionist activists. </s>
<s n="s3.11;p16.19">Yet it will always be fought for by people who believe in autonomy and choice, right up until the end of life itself. </s>
<s n="s4.11;p16.19">The question facing us today is whether medical professionals should be involved in this practice. </s>
<s n="s5.11;p16.19">Is it the antithesis of proper medicine? </s>
<s n="s6.11;p16.19">Perhaps it is unavoidable that doctors and nurses will be embroiled in this issue. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p16.19">They play a key role in our lives and more often than not, become part of our lives. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p16.19">Euthanasia is an issue that if not legalised and regulated will still continue in the shadows. </s>
<s n="s9.11;p16.19">The Netherlands model may not be what we wish for the U.K., but the Oregon model has shown no signs of abuse. </s>
<s n="s10.11;p16.19">Doctors quietly assist suicide by prescribing the necessary drugs and do no more. </s>
<s n="s11.11;p16.19">Statistics show most of the time, the patients do not follow through with their plans. </s>

<p n="p17.19">
<s n="s1.6;p17.19">If Euthanasia was legitimised, doctors would definitely play a key role, as they do not. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p17.19">Strict guidelines should ensure that a patient who asks for help in committing suicide is first counselled extensively and assessed by independent parties as to whether this request was made competently and under duress. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p17.19">Granting the request should be the final resort. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p17.19">This is key; euthanasia must never be the first resort. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p17.19">However strict guidelines require much manpower and resources. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p17.19">With a health care system that is already strapped for funds and resources it is doubtful how well euthanasia can be regulated. </s>
</p>
<p n="p18.19">
<s n="s1.4;p18.19">In conclusion, all rests on what society's concept of proper medicine is. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p18.19">Is it, as afore mentioned, limited only to cure? </s>
<s n="s3.4;p18.19">Or does it encompass the patient's best interests and a goal to improve the quality of life? </s>
<s n="s4.4;p18.19">Perhaps the oath sworn by all doctors says it all: </s>

<s n="s1.5;p19.19">"Most especially must I tread with care in matters of life and death. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p19.19">If it is given me to save a life, all thanks. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p19.19">But it may also be within my power to take a life; this awesome responsibility must be faced with great humbleness and awareness of my own frailty. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p19.19">Above all, I must not play at God." - </s>
<s n="s5.5;p19.19">Hippocratic Oath </s>
