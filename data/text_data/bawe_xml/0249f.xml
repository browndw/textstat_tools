</p>
<p n="p20.68">
<s n="s1.3;p20.68">The switch marked (D) was switched off, the variable output control knob on the supply panel set to zero, and the output voltage selector set to 1 (three-phase). </s>

</p>
<p n="p21.68">
<s n="s1.5;p21.68">The variable output control was turned to about 25% and the values for the three line-to-neutral voltages were recorded (O2) to check they were all within 1 or 2% of one another to enable errors to be spotted and corrected, to reduce inconsistencies at a later stage. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p66.68">Instrumentation of greater accuracy should eliminate discrepancies, and decrease the tolerance levels from 1 or 2% to a fraction of 1%. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p66.68">Eliminating the need to read the peak current manually by counting off an oscilloscope, and instead recording a readout from a much more precise machine would produce far more accurate results. </s>

<p n="p67.68">
<s n="s1.3;p67.68">The three-phase induction motor upon which the laboratory was conducted showed that for loads requiring power levels much lower than the rated values, the efficiency of the motor is very low indeed. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p67.68">This results in wasted energy and therefore increased cost with prolonged usage. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p67.68">The speed at which the motor rotates is also a lot higher at low torque values, possibly resulting in excessive wear to the motor. </s>
</p>
<p n="p68.68">
<s n="s1.3;p68.68">The motor performs, as is to be expected, at greatest efficiency when operated at its rated values. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p68.68">When the motor becomes overloaded, efficiency starts to fall, and power factor plateaus and at that point the motor stalls. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p68.68">When in operation at loads greater than the rated power levels, the motor can quickly overheat, so should not be used in this state for more than a couple of minutes. </s>
