<s n="s2.2;p14.34">This could come from a wing of finite length which adds downwards momentum, thus changing the pressure distribution or arises at the wingtips, which causes higher pressure below the wing and lower pressure above it will cause the air to "roll around" the wingtip, creating a vortex which is shed behind the aircraft. </s>
