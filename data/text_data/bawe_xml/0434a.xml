The position of the SPCC correlates closely with the orientation of the AP axis and the direction of the stream flows. Meanwhile, the cell cortex under goes polarized changes, with the anterior cortex of the embryo ruffles and the posterior becomes smooth in a process called pseudocleavage. Several important changes take place at this stage: (1) Organization of cortical maternal partitioning proteins (PAR proteins), (2) migration of the oocyte pronucleus to the posterior, (3) migration of germline P granules to the posterior. Sperm asters are required for female pronuclear movement and premitotic positioning of the pronuclei. Soon when the two pronuclei meet, they migrate to the embryo's centre. Here the pronuclear-centrosomal complex rotates 90 degree and the pronuclear envelope breakdown to set up the bipolar spindle. Posterior displacement of the spindle takes place with the accumulation of polarization. Finally, the first asymmetric cleavage takes place and result in a larger anterior AB, and a smaller posterior P <hi rend="sub">1</hi>
