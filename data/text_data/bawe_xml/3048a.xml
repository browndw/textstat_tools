<s n="s1.2;p1.58">In a climate of academic controversy over political and historical upheaval in the Middle East, CUP plan to publish the postponed <hi rend="italic">Illustrated History of the Middle East</hi> with an additional chapter reflecting current events in Iraq and Palestine. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p1.58">PEST and SWOT analysis (Appendix I) reveals multiple opportunities to exploit CUP's strength in the subject area. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.58">
<s n="s1.4;p2.58">Despite strong market share in general Asia History publishing (where OUP's sales have been declining) CUP lags behinds both OUP and Blackwell in <hi rend="italic">hardback</hi> sales. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p2.58">(Appendix III). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p2.58">OUP have been steadily increasing hardback sales in Asia History: it is essential that we bring out new hardback material in this area to compete. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p2.58">The new title will aim to increase our market share in hardback History, gaining competitive advantage by developing the marketing mix with a superior product and pricing. </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="underlined bold">Subject Knowledge</head>
<p n="p3.58">
<s n="s1.2;p3.58">The monograph series <hi rend="italic">Cambridge Studies in Islamic Civilization</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cambridge Middle East Studies</hi> have augmented our Middle East programme with publications from senior scholars and promising newcomers. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p3.58">Our extensive list and personal acquaintance with leading academics in this discipline creates real sales opportunities, promoting the title with experience, market familiarity and a tried-and-tested marketing plan in both the wider subject field and Histories list. </s>

<head rend="underlined bold">Competition</head>
<p n="p5.58">
<s n="s1.3;p5.58">OUP, our biggest competitor in hardback History publishing, are publishing <hi rend="italic">The Modern Middle East: A Sourcebook for History</hi> in February 2006. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p5.58">This hardback is twice as long with only 11 integrated illustrations in comparison with our 99 colour plates, giving our title competitive advantage: it will target the trade as well as academic market. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p5.58">The length and format of the OUP title does not allow it to crossover so easily. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.58">
<s n="s1.3;p6.58">Blackwell's market share in Asia History publishing is increasing (Appendix III) and their hardback sales in General History exceed ours. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p6.58">However, to our advantage smaller academic publishers like Blackwell cannot target segments outside the specialised academic market. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p6.58">As a major university press, we can afford to target general readers as well as the comparatively small group of specialised academics. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p7.58">The marketing plan details how these benefits will be communicated to the target markets. </s>
