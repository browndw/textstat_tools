<s n="s3.8;p1.25">The economic interdependency which emerged prior to the Second World War was subsequently consolidated by the post-bellum foreign policy of the United States in order to promote regional stability. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p1.25">From this, cooperation has developed around a core of economic and production networks. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p1.25">This core of functional interdependency still forms the concrete basis from which regionalism in Pacific Asia is occurring today. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p1.25">Despite a proliferation of potentially divisive issues that have abounded since the turn of the century, economic cooperation provides the impetus for cooperation concerning new and increasingly salient issues which are potentially dangerous conflict ridden. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p1.25">Beginning with locating Japanese imperialism in its historical context, this essay demonstrates that notwithstanding the political and military nature of expansion, the Japanese colonial project had a lasting economic legacy which pervaded the cold-war period and to some extent remains today. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p2.25">Japanese imperialism was the precursor for economic regionalism based on modernisation and industrialisation in East Asia. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p2.25">With an analysis of the economic legacy of the empire and of contemporary regionalism it is possible to assess how useful regional bilateral and multilateral ties have become and whether the economic basis for a united region remains significant. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p2.25">Regional networks that crystallised during the twentieth century as a result of Japan engaging the region have increasingly become strained by new issues in the era of globalisation. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p2.25">This assertion does not signify the impotency of functional and pragmatic economic interdependence but emphasises the need to accommodate the new and highly salient issues which pervade the epoch. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p3.25">Beginning with locating Japanese imperialism in its historical context, this essay will aim to demonstrate that despite the political and military nature of expansion, the Japanese colonial project had a lasting economic legacy which pervaded the cold-war period and is still prominent today. </s>

<s n="s1.6;pn1.1">The term 'East Asia' will be employed throughout this essay to imply a region including both the nations of northeast and southeast Asia, 'China, Japan, South Korea and the ten members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)'. </s>
<s n="s2.6;pn1.1">Nations to the north, south, west, or in the centre of Asia, or supposedly 'non-Asian' nations with an interest in the region such as Australia and the United States, are not included in this definition of East Asia, Takashi Terada, 'Constructing an "East Asian" Concept and Growing Regional Identity: From EAEC to ASEAN+3', <hi rend="italic">The Pacific Review</hi>, Vol.16, No.2 (2003), p.252. </s>
<s n="s3.6;pn1.1">When the latter, 'non-Asian' states are included in relation to the region, the term 'Pacific Asia' will be used. </s>
<s n="s4.6;pn1.1">The implication of this second distinction is that cross-Pacific issues which impact on East Asia and vice-versa are entering into the discussion. </s>
<s n="s5.6;pn1.1">Finally, when other 'Asian' states are involved - those not regarded as part of 'East Asia' or 'Pacific Asia' in the above distinction - the term 'Asia' will be used to denote the region in question Glen Hook, 'Japan and the Construction of Asia-Pacific', in Andrew Gamble and Anthony Payne (eds.) <hi rend="italic">Regionalism and World Order</hi>, Basingstoke : Macmillan Press, 1996, p.170. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p4.25">There are rich and profound historical and political discourses concerning imperialism which help to conceive of it as a particular form of political and economic development rather than simply a militaristic, historical aberration.<ref target="BAWE_0255d-ftnote.002"/> Unfortunately, this essay does not have the scope to include such a discussion at any great length. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p4.25">Moreover, when studying Japanese imperialism in particular - and East Asian relations in general - it is essential to remain aware of the need to ignore the tendency to impose Western-specific theoretical models if they do not apply.<ref target="BAWE_0255d-ftnote.003"/> Again, such a discussion is beyond the scope of this essay, but hopefully it is implicit in the argument that follows. </s>

<p n="p5.25">
<s n="s1.5;p5.25">Hilary Conroy sets Japanese imperialism within the context of imperialism as a political phenomenon, referring to the theories of Hobson, Lenin, Schumpeter, Aron, Morgenthau and Waltz, in order to explain how imperialism must be understood as a consequence of the political thought of an era in which the "national interest [was] defined in terms of power". </s>

<s n="s3.5;p5.25">It was at this time that the Korean peninsula was referred to as a "dagger pointed at the heart of Japan". </s>
<s n="s4.5;p5.25">Japanese imperialism was conceptualised in <hi rend="italic">realpolitik</hi> terms of national survival. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p5.25">In a desperate attempt to modernise, or else succumb to the Great Powers, the attainment of territory and wealth was assumed to be an urgent requirement.<ref target="BAWE_0255d-ftnote.005"/> Japanese expansionist wars were wars 'waged in order to establish Japan as an independent state'.<ref target="BAWE_0255d-ftnote.006"/> As the Japanese scholar Takahashi Kamekichi stated, "Japan's wars with China and Russia and its annexation of Korea were all wars for the sake of Japan's independence and self-support".<ref target="BAWE_0255d-ftnote.007"/> Japanese imperialism is best understood as an extraordinary fusion of the political and economic motivations to expand which permeated the era.<ref target="BAWE_0255d-ftnote.008"/> </s>

<p n="p6.25">
<s n="s1.5;p6.25">At the height of expansion, immersed in the rhetoric of leading Asia into modernity, Japanese elites recognised that in order to realise their goals they 'would need to have at [their] disposal...the greater part of the region's resources'. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p6.25">The intensification of militarist expansion paved the way for conflict with Russia, Britain and the United States.<ref target="BAWE_0255d-ftnote.009"/> In 1940, at the height of its hubris, Japan officially announced the concept of the Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere (GEACPS). </s>
<s n="s3.5;p6.25">The GEACPS was to have more than just connotations of economic interdependence - it was to be the basis of a political, social and cultural homogeneity extending across East Asia determined by supposedly ethnically superior Japanese elites.<ref target="BAWE_0255d-ftnote.010"/> In order to fully realise these ambitions, the Japanese decided they would have to completely remove the Western powers from the region. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p6.25">Therefore, at the end of 1941 they launched the infamous attack on the United States Navy at Pearl Harbour and nullified the British naval threat in Singapore. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p6.25">At this point, the Japanese empire straddled a vast unchallenged territory, 'from Rangoon to the mid-Pacific, from Timor to the Mongolian steppe'.<ref target="BAWE_0255d-ftnote.011"/> </s>

<s n="s1.6;p7.25">Rejecting the official dogma, which heralded notions of cultural, moral, political and economic philanthropy and 'pan-Asian' prosperity, John Dower highlights the racial perspective of Japanese expansionism, which was inspired by modern Western born concepts of social Darwinism combined with apparently Confucian ideals of "proper place".<ref target="BAWE_0255d-ftnote.012"/> What becomes clear through such accounts is that the peculiar fusion of Occidental and Oriental ideas resulted in anything but an altruistic conceptualisation of modernising the region to compete with the West. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p7.25">Although the Japanese never achieved a homogenous, identity bound empire, since political conflict against communism raged to the north and clashes of religion and culture were widespread to the south, the barbaric subjugation imposed upon the region served one concrete end - industrialisation and modernisation.<ref target="BAWE_0255d-ftnote.013"/> The Japanese national interest hinged on 'the spoils of war'. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p7.25">If expansion had not been primarily belligerent, war and oppression became regarded as pragmatic measures through which commercial success would breed political might. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p7.25">Wars were 'to be fought over rice, minerals, markets and farming land'. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p7.25">Quite rightly, Donald Calman warns against forgetting that military atrocities and officially sanctioned oppression were 'monstrosities'.<ref target="BAWE_0255d-ftnote.014"/> Furthermore, issues such as slavery and the exploitation of "comfort women" still haunt the region's history today.<ref target="BAWE_0255d-ftnote.015"/> However, it is important here to flush out from the dark history of Japanese imperialism the economic aspects which were very much intertwined with the political motivation to expand. </s>

<s n="s2.7;p8.25">François Godement, without ignoring Calman's warning, highlights the modernising influence of the extension of Japanese economic development across the region - although some fared better than others - 'between 1896 and 1936...[Taiwan's] GNP rose by 260 per cent'.<ref target="BAWE_0255d-ftnote.016"/> Japanese imperialism undoubtedly led to the modernisation and development of its colonial acquisitions. </s>
