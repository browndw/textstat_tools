<s n="s1.5;p1.27">The British General Election of 2001 resulted in Britain's lowest voter turnout since 1918. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p1.27">Only 59.1% of the population cast a vote, and this increased only slightly to 61.2% in 2005. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p1.27">Considering turnout had never dropped below 71.5% between the years 1970 and 1997<ref target="BAWE_0275c-ftnote.001"/>, concerns have been raised regarding why turnout has declined so substantially in recent years, and has then failed to make much of a recovery in 2005. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p1.27">It is important to contemplate what may have caused this drop in turnout, and what attempts have been made to improve it. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p1.27">It is also significant to look at the behaviour of the youngest cohorts of voters, and how it compares to the oldest. </s>

<p n="p2.27">
<s n="s1.1;p2.27">There are two main arguments that have been put forward when explaining the drop in voter turnout, the first being that the electorate has lost interest in politics and the political process, and the second being the failure of political parties to mobilize voters and encourage them to vote. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.27">
<s n="s1.5;p3.27">Contrary to popular belief, there is little evidence to assert that in recent years people have lost interest in politics. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p3.27">MORI has been carrying out regular surveys over the years, and has found that in 2005, at least 61% of the population stated that they were 'interested' or 'fairly interested' in politics, which is close to the 60% who declared the same in both 1973 and 1997<ref target="BAWE_0275c-ftnote.002"/>. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p3.27">This reveals that the level of political interest has been quite stable over time. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p3.27">So if apathy does not explain the recent decline in turnout at British General Elections, what does? </s>
<s n="s5.5;p3.27">One view is that people no longer feel motivated to vote, which can be attributed to many factors such as a fall in party identification and the way people view the political scene<ref target="BAWE_0275c-ftnote.003"/>. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p4.27">Fewer people have strong attachments to political parties, and so feel less committed to voting for them and showing their support. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p4.27">This is due, in large part, to the fact that many people see the policies of the two major parties, Conservative and Labour, as being very similar, and so do not associate themselves with either one of them. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p4.27">This was especially so with the 2001 election, when only 21% of the population saw a "great deal" of difference between Labour and Conservative<ref target="BAWE_0275c-ftnote.004"/>- a slight increase from the 17% who thought so in 1997. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p4.27">With a lack of strong party identification, people are not so bothered about the result of the election, and so do not see much point in voting: "What does voting achieve, and what difference does it make which politician or party wins?<ref target="BAWE_0275c-ftnote.005"/>" In the 2001 election, only one in three people said it was personally important who won the election<ref target="BAWE_0275c-ftnote.006"/>. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p5.27">Another reason many people have been less motivated to vote, is the feeling of alienation people from the political process. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p5.27">This is largely due the level of 'political efficacy' people believe they possess. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p5.27">Political efficacy is the "belief that one can influence the outcome of political decisions"<ref target="BAWE_0275c-ftnote.007"/>, and the stronger it is, the more likely people will turn out to vote. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p5.27">So it is more a feeling of disengagement rather than lack of interest in the political process which discourages people from voting. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p5.27">This also stems from the fact that most of the population do not relate to politicians, who along with political institutions, are viewed sceptically and with distrust. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p5.27">Politicians are seen as putting their own interests first, and disregarding the genuine needs of the people. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p6.27">The feeling of alienation and lack of political efficacy is largely related to the electoral system used in Britain, which some people argue is another discouraging factor in the British electoral process<ref target="BAWE_0275c-ftnote.008"/>. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p6.27">With the 'First-past-the-post' system, people do not feel fairly represented, and think that their votes will count for nothing. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p6.27">For example, in the 2005 election the contest was closer in terms of Conservative versus Labour votes, however, when these were projected into seats, Labour still had a clear majority. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p6.27">This led people to believing that the outcome was decided, so their votes would not have made much of a difference. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p6.27">This is especially so in Labour 'safe seats' which leads to the next point of how types of constituencies affect turnout. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p7.27">Constituencies which are considered as being 'safe seats' are more likely to have a lower turnout than those which are seen as being 'marginal seats'. </s>

<s n="s3.5;p7.27">The votes cast in 'safe' constituencies are in general, unlikely to make much of a difference to the results of the election. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p7.27">This feeling of unimportance was accentuated in both the 1997 and the 2001 elections by the media continuously stressing that each election was a 'foregone conclusion'<ref target="BAWE_0275c-ftnote.009"/>. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p7.27">Opinion polls also forecasted the outcomes long before Election Day, leading people to believe that there really was not much they could do about the outcome. </s>

<p n="p8.27">
<s n="s1.4;p8.27">Another reason the type of constituencies has affected turnout in the more recent elections, is the different levels of attention given by the political parties to the different constituencies. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p8.27">Political parties tend to spend the majority of their resources and efforts trying to secure marginal seats, and pay less attention to safe ones. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p8.27">This leads people living in the safe constituencies to feeling 'ignored', and so makes potential voters stay at home on Election Day. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p8.27">This is an example of how political parties have failed to mobilise electors. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.27">
<s n="s1.4;p9.27">The social composition and characteristics of the people living in different constituencies also affects turnout. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p9.27">People living in more affluent areas or living in privately-owned accommodation are seen as being more stable and so more likely to vote<ref target="BAWE_0275c-ftnote.010"/>. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p9.27">The opposite can be said for people living in wealthy areas, which have a larger number of manual or unemployed workers, or people living in rented accommodation. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p9.27">It happens to be the case that most of the people living in these areas tend to be disillusioned Labour supporters, and so perhaps account for the decline in voter turnout between the 1997 and 2001 elections. </s>

<p n="p12.27">
<s n="s1.2;p12.27">Many Conservatives were also disappointed with their party and the scandals and splits within it and so did not turn out to vote. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p12.27">However, it should be noted that a considerable proportion of the Conservatives switched their loyalty to another party<ref target="BAWE_0275c-ftnote.012"/>, rather than not voting, and so it did not really affect the turnout level. </s>

<s n="s2.6;p22.27">However, as with the rest of the electorate, perceptions about political involvement depend greatly on how the conception of politics is viewed. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p22.27">In reality, many youths are quite active when it comes to political matters, but not necessarily those regarding traditional party politics. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p22.27">An increased number of people have participated and expressed their views through Non-Governmental Organisations, pressure groups and organised protests. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p22.27">Despite this, it is true that many of they youngest potential voters do feel alienated from British politics. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p22.27">Many justifications are given for this, ranging from lack of knowledge of the political world, to the attitudes of parties towards the youngest voters. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p23.27">It is fair to say that the youngest age group able to vote will not have been as exposed to political processes as the older ones, and therefore may not have had to develop the strong voting habits older voters tend to have. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p23.27">Having had less political knowledge, youths may be more likely to take for granted preconceptions portrayed for example, by the media. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p23.27">The political participation of youths will also be quite strongly influenced by those of their parents. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p23.27">It is more probably that a young person growing up will become a non-voter if their parents also happen to be so. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p23.27">This contrasts greatly with the generation of older voters, who are more likely to have developed strong voting habits in their youth, and see it as duty rather than an option. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p23.27">Older voters are less likely to be shaken by short-term variables such as the level of interest of an election and so will vote anyway, regardless of the campaign.<ref target="BAWE_0275c-ftnote.021"/>. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p23.27">This perhaps reflects the different values instilled in youths growing up today compared with those of older generations. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p24.27">Younger voters do feel detached from the political process, and this is largely because they feel a lack of attention from politicians, who tend to focus on the "middle-age, middle-England" voters<ref target="BAWE_0275c-ftnote.022"/>. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p24.27">This leads to beliefs that politicians do not 'listen' to young people, which in turn frustrates them and discourages them from voting. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p24.27">Also, what frequently occurs is that young people cast their votes at their first elections, but end up disappointed with the result and apparent lack of influence. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p25.27">The actual practical aspects of voting also affect the youngest and the oldest voters in different ways. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p25.27">Older votes are likely to have less to do with their everyday lives, and so have more time to accompany political events and go down to the polling station and place their votes. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p25.27">It has been suggested that this may be looked upon as being an opportunity of going out and meeting people<ref target="BAWE_0275c-ftnote.023"/>, providing them with more of an incentive. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p25.27">Young people on the other hand, have a less stable lifestyle and feel the need to focus on issues other than politics such as start-up problems, personal relationships, and working on their careers. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p25.27">So, there is quite a lot that could discourage the youngest age group from voting in comparison to the oldest age group, but this does not mean that the political interest does not exist. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p26.27">Perhaps what one can deduce from this, is that measures must be taken to try and improve turnout and electoral participation in the next General Elections, or Britain could be facing a Democratic Crisis where a minority of the population casts a vote on Election Day. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p26.27">The government may find that even those who they have taken for granted will vote may lose the motivation to do so. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p26.27">By looking at the causes of the decline in turnout, it is easier for one to come up with attempts of improving it, and studies have shown that electoral reforms are not necessarily the best way to do so. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p26.27">It is the substance of the campaigns which need to change, not the methods used to vote with. </s>

<p n="p27.27">
<s n="s1.2;p27.27">Finally, the youngest cohorts of voters should not immediately be dismissed as being apathetic, as although it may not be apparent at first, young people are often heavily engaged in political affairs. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p27.27">People need to be more open-minded when analysing their involvement, as it is not always in the traditional sense, and can be very different to that of the older electors. </s>
