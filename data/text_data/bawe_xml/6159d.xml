<s n="s1.8;p1.29">Bread is an important element of a healthy balanced diet. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p1.29">Bread is part of the 'fibrous' food group, which includes bread, potatoes, pasta, rice, noodles and breakfast cereals. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p1.29">These foods are high in fibre and rich in vitamins from the B complex, they should be the main part of every meal. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p1.29">Bread is mass-produced commercially for the domestic consumer giving a relatively low final cost. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p1.29">Many people prefer bakery bread either because of the fresh traditional taste or because of its low additive concentration. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p1.29">With the use of a domestic breadmaker the consumer can decide exactly what goes into their bread and have a freshly baked loaf to greet them and their family in the morning. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p1.29">There is a variety of domestic breadmakers, with a great range of price, features and design. </s>

</p>
<list type="bulleted">
<head>Kenwood (traditional, slow process):</head>
<item>2hrs 30mins baking time</item>
<item>Rectangular pan with circular sweeping motion of the paddle. This gave the bread a non-uniform texture, as the corners were not properly mixed.</item>
<item>The bread had a fluffy sticky texture.</item>
<item>The paddle was connected to the pan leaving a hole in the bread when removed.</item>
<item>There was a concave depression in the top of the bread, which coincided with the window. This is due to heat transmission through the glass leaving a region of cooler air inside the pan.</item>

<list type="bulleted">
<head>Kenwood (quick process)</head>
<item>1hr baking time</item>
<item>The exterior of the bread had a smooth appearance and non-uniform colouration.</item>
<item>The bread gave the impression to be denser than the bread from the slow process. Also it resembled a 'sponge'.</item>
<item>The taste was stodgy and sticky, with underdone areas around the paddle hole.</item>
</list>
<list type="bulleted">
<head>Breville (large, fan assisted)</head>
<item>3hrs 25mins baking time</item>
<item>Loaf was difficult to remove from pan, shouldn't use metal utensils because may damage non-stick coating.</item>
<item>Paddle stays in bread so has to be cut out, must take care as it remains hot.</item>
<item>Uneven mixing of the dough, swirls are present in the loaf.</item>

<p n="p3.29">
<s n="s1.3;p3.29">Testing of the bread could have been quantitative rather than qualitative. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p3.29">This would have given scientific comparisons between the different breads. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p3.29">The following criteria could have been followed: </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p4.29">
<s n="s1.2;p4.29">Moisture content, the loaf could be weighed once it came out of the pan, then dried out and re-weighed. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p4.29">Then the moisture percentage could be calculated. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p5.29">
<s n="s1.2;p5.29">Colour, a "colourometer" or "reflectometer" could be used to determine the colour of the crust. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p5.29">This would probably correspond to the breadmakers temperature. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p6.29">
<s n="s1.1;p6.29">Crustiness, a hardness test such as Rockwell or Brinell could be performed on the crust. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p7.29">
<s n="s1.3;p7.29">Density, the loaf fresh out of the maker could be weighed and then the volume and finally density calculated. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p7.29">The volume could be obtained by measuring the displacement in water. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p7.29">The bread would have to be wrapped in a non-porous material such as cling-film to prevent water absorption. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.29">
<s n="s1.2;p8.29">Instead of using the brand recommended recipes in each machine, the same recipes could be used. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p8.29">This would give a fairer comparison for quantitative criteria. </s>
