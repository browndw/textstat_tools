<p n="p73.77">
<s n="s1.6;p73.77">All of the coefficients in the above models are significant at the 5% level with the exception of <hi rend="italic">Sex</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">IQ</hi> model (which is significant at the 11% level) and <hi rend="italic">owner</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">RComp</hi> model (which is significant at the 6% level). </s>
<s n="s2.6;p73.77">IQ increases with birthweight ratio, with an increase of 1 corresponding to an increase in IQ of 22.739 points. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p73.77">IQ differs between the genders, with males having a lower IQ by 3.277 points. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p73.77">In terms of social characteristics, having a mother who left education at or before the age of 16 equates to a 7.452 point decrease in IQ, having a mother living in owner-occupied accommodation equates to a 5.373 point increase and living in a family receiving social service benefits equates to a 8.970 point decrease. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p73.77">Similarly, having a mother who left education at or before the age of 16 equates to a 10.209 point decrease in reading comprehension score, having a mother living in owner-occupied accommodation equates to a 6.063 point increase and living in a family receiving benefits equates to a 9.562 point decrease. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p73.77">Test of motor impairment score depends heavily on birthweight ratio and gestational age, with an increase in ratio of 1 corresponding to a 4.725 decrease in ToMI score and an increase in gestational age of one week corresponding to a 0.469 decrease. </s>

<p n="p74.77">
<s n="s1.5;p74.77">Generally, it appears as though cognitive development depends heavily on the social background of the infant. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p74.77">Reading comprehension score appears to depend almost completely on social background, indicating that improvement in this area is affected heavily by the environment in which they are raised rather than the effect of preterm birth. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p74.77">The other measure of cognitive development, IQ, does appear to be affected heavily by birthweight ratio, suggesting that preterm birth can have an effect on general cognitive development. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p74.77">On the other hand, motor development does not appear to be based heavily on social background, with the chosen model suggesting it is mainly affected by birth characteristics. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p74.77">Infants who are born closer to term and who weigh more than expected display better motor skills. </s>

<p n="p75.77">
<s n="s1.8;p75.77">The study has some significant limitations. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p75.77">The final models arrived at are still not totally satisfactory. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p75.77">While the model for IQ seems to fit pretty well, the models for the other two variables show non-Normality and evidence of non-constant variance, suggesting that some of the assumptions of modelling have been violated. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p75.77">This casts doubts on the reliability and usefulness of the final models. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p75.77">A key assumption of linear regression is that the variables being modelled follow a Normal distribution. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p75.77">This did not appear to be the case for reading comprehension score and test of motor impairment score, so a generalised linear model may be a better approach to modelling these variables. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p75.77">In particular, in the case of test of motor impairment score, a log-linear model may be more appropriate. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p75.77">It may also be worth examining interactions between the independent variables, or looking at quadratic effects. </s>
</p>
<p n="p76.77">
<s n="s1.3;p76.77">One concern when examining the data is that gestational age is measured in weeks. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p76.77">A more useful variable might be gestational age measured in days, which would allow for further analysis of this birth characteristic. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p76.77">This might prove be an interesting extension of the study. </s>
</p>
<p n="p77.77">
<s n="s1.4;p77.77">Furthermore, since the study only considered those infants born with a gestational age of 32 weeks or under and those weighing under 2kg, the model can only be applied to predicting infants in this range. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p77.77">The results of the findings of the study cannot be extended to infants born at term or afterwards. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p77.77">The data set does not appear to be that representative of the general population, with an average IQ of below 100 and higher proportions of the social characteristics than would be expected. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p77.77">An interesting and useful extension of the study would be to consider data from all births, allowing further application of the model. </s>
