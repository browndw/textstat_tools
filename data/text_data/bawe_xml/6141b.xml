<s n="s4.15;p1.40">Epidemiological prevalence is worldwide, surmounting to 33% infection rate in the UK alone. </s>
<s n="s5.15;p1.40">Transmission is via bite wounds and infected saliva entering the blood system. </s>
<s n="s6.15;p1.40">Research reveals that entire, free-roaming males are the most vulnerable to the infection due to fighting behaviour most typically seen in males. </s>
<s n="s7.15;p1.40">The virus belong to the Retroviridae family of viruses and is classed as a Retrovirus. </s>
<s n="s8.15;p1.40">The virus is further subclassed as a Lentivirus, in which FIV and HIV both belong. </s>
<s n="s9.15;p1.40">The lentiviruses are slow developing, symptoms taking years to show. </s>
<s n="s10.15;p1.40">These viruses weaken the immune system of the host resulting in the host becoming more susceptible to infections. </s>
<s n="s11.15;p1.40">In cats, the white blood cells are depleted, leaving them less able to fight infection and so will succumb to secondary and opportunistic infections. </s>
<s n="s12.15;p1.40">There are four main phases of infection. </s>
<s n="s13.15;p1.40">Each with associated clinical symptoms ranging from lymphadenopathy to neurological disorders and tumours and finally resulting in death.. </s>
<s n="s14.15;p1.40">Spread of virus infection is minimised by early diagnosis using the ELISA serological method, neutering and restriction of movement. </s>

<s n="s2.2;p2.40">A relatively new feline viral disease, this virus was first isolated and named as recently as 1987 in Davis, California and it was then that scientist first realised that the virus possessed similar biochemical properties with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and thus this pathogen was named named Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV)<hi rend="sub">4</hi>. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.40">
<s n="s1.2;p3.40">In general, domestic cats are vaccinated against the most common feline infectious diseases such as flu; enteritis; FeLV (feline leukemia); and chlamydia. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p3.40">To date, however, there is no efficient vaccination available for FIV and this immunosuppressant disease therefore remains a common pathogen which is becoming more globally prevalent. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.40">
<s n="s1.2;p4.40">Although FIV is becoming more widely known it is unclear how much information is available to the general public. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p4.40">The aim of this report is to provide the reader with a concise general overview of the causes and effects of the Feline Immunodeficiency Virus infection, more specifically to convey the primary facts of the classification, epidemiology, clinical signs, diagnosis and prevention of this terminal feline pathogen. </s>

<p n="p5.40">
<s n="s1.1;p5.40">In order to understand the nature of FIV and it's effects on the domestic cat, it is necessary to appreciate the properties of the virus that is responsible. </s>

<p n="p6.40">
<s n="s1.2;p6.40">The feline immunodeficiency virus belongs to the Retroviridae family of viruses. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p6.40">The Retroviridae family further divide into 3 subfamilies. </s>

<p rend="ordered" n="p7.40">
<s n="s1.1;p7.40">Subfamily Oncoviriae: This family includes viruses such as feline leukemia (FeLV). </s>
</p>

<s n="s1.1;p8.40">Subfamily Spumavirinae: This family includes viruses such as bovine foamy virus, feline foamy virus and they usually result in anemia. </s>
</p>
<p rend="ordered" n="p9.40">
<s n="s1.2;p9.40">Subfamily Lentivirinae (lenti meaning 'slow'): This family includes viruses which are slow developing. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p9.40">FIV and HIV both belong to this group. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.40">
<s n="s1.4;p10.40">Morphologically, the Retroviridae virus is an enveloped virus, spherical in shape and possessing single-stranded RNA. They are typically 80-130 nm in diameter <hi rend="sub">2</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p10.40">Lentiviruses are a small group of viruses that cause very slow developing infections that are often called 'slow virus diseases' or slow infections. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p10.40">This means that the primary clinical symptoms of the disease may take years to show <hi rend="sub">3</hi>. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p10.40">It describes an infection that is persistent in nature with a very long incubation phase followed by a long, progressive and invariably lethal disease. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.40">
<s n="s1.2;p11.40">A lentivirus such as the feline immunodeficiency virus affects the immune system of the host by virus replication and then by efficiently destroying the helper-T-cells which are responsible for enhancing the important immunological function of the lymphocyte cells. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p11.40">These are complex cells and they have two main functions; i. to kill cells which have been infected with pathogens, and ii. they have a key involvement in controlling the immunological process. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p13.40">The epidemiology of the feline immunodeficiency virus occurs worldwide. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p13.40">In 1989, Yamamoto reported that the prevalence in Europe of FIV has been reported as a range of 2% in Germany and The Netherlands, to 33% in the UK with evidence that the US infection prevalence percentages varied from 1-16% and Japan showing a very high prevalence of infection of up to 44%. </s>

</p>
<p n="p14.40">
<s n="s1.3;p14.40">The reason for the marked differences in infection rates may be due to the varying animal behaviour. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p14.40">Recent epidemiology investigations by Courchamp and Pontier in 1994 have reported that FIV transmission is influenced by behaviour. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p14.40">An article by Yamamoto (1989) stated that higher rates of infection are shown in cats that are typically free-roaming and more exposed to other infected cats, and are therefore more susceptible to the most common mode of transmission which is the bite wound. </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.40">
<s n="s1.3;p15.40">The feline immunodeficiency virus was first discovered and isolated in 1987. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p15.40">This is comparatively recent to other known viruses, however in a recent article by Reid <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> (1992), it was reported that FIV has been around since 1966. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p15.40">They know this because sera isolated from infected cats were stored in Europe as long ago as 1966. </s>

<p n="p16.40">
<s n="s1.3;p16.40">FIV is primarily spread to other cats by a puncturing bite wound. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p16.40">The infection has been found to be more common is male cats than in female cats, in particular the free-roaming, territory-defending male cats, and increasingly in those cats living in high density populations, such as feral colonies. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p16.40">Infection rates have been found to be lower in cats that are kept mainly indoors where possible, and cats use for breeding purposes have been found to have lower prevalence of infection due to their restricted living conditions <hi rend="sub">4.</hi> </s>
</p>
<p n="p17.40">
<s n="s1.2;p17.40">It is important to note that there is no evidence that FIV can be transmitted to mammals other than cats. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p17.40">Retroviruses are species-specific, which means that a feline retrovirus will infect only cats and similarly, a human retrovirus, such as HIV will only infect humans <hi rend="sub">5</hi>. </s>
</p>
<p n="p18.40">
<s n="s1.1;p18.40">There is some evidence that in rare cases, FIV antibodies can be transmitted to a newborn kitten via an infected Queen either during passage through the birth canal (in <hi rend="italic">utero</hi>), and also via the kitten ingesting milk provided by a Queen that has been infected during gestation or lactation <hi rend="sub">4</hi>. </s>
</p>
<p n="p19.40">
<s n="s1.4;p19.40">It is a common misconception that, like FeLV, the FIV infection can be transmitted by casual contact such as the sharing of food bowls, grooming, sharing litter boxes and living in close contact with other cats that may also be infected. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p19.40">This is not the case. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p19.40">The saliva must enter the blood stream to cause the infection. </s>
