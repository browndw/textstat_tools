<s n="s1.9;p1.14">It cannot be denied that the European Commission occupies a "central position"<ref target="BAWE_0315c-ftnote.001"/> within the framework of the EU institutions. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p1.14">The Commission has come a long way from its humble beginnings in the 1950s. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p1.14">The Commission's "influence usually looms large"<ref target="BAWE_0315c-ftnote.002"/>, as it possesses legislative, executive, administrative and judicial functions. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p1.14">It has been at the heart of the Single European Market project and much EU policy emanates from the Commission. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p1.14">However, it does not necessarily follow that the Commission is the government of the EU, even if it views itself thus. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p1.14">The traditional image of the Commission is of a monolithic supranational bureaucracy and for many euro-sceptics "the European Commission is a natural bogeyman"<ref target="BAWE_0315c-ftnote.003"/>. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p1.14">Yet, it is far from being omnipotent and lacks some crucial features of a government. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p1.14">Indeed, it can be argued that it is "a bit of a dog's breakfast"<ref target="BAWE_0315c-ftnote.004"/> as it suffers from "structural fragmentation"<ref target="BAWE_0315c-ftnote.005"/>. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p1.14">Furthermore, the Commission has been plagued by allegations of corruption and for it to be a proper government, it needs legitimacy and accountability. </s>

<p n="p2.14">
<s n="s1.11;p2.14">It is firstly appropriate to consider what is meant by the term government. </s>
<s n="s2.11;p2.14">It is important to remember that the EU operates under a "sui generis" structure. </s>
<s n="s3.11;p2.14">Therefore, one cannot really compare the Commission to any of the national governments of the member states. </s>
<s n="s4.11;p2.14">Nevertheless, any pseudo-governmental body must have authority and a means of exercising control over the people or states it governs. </s>
<s n="s5.11;p2.14">A government should propose and pass legislation in the interests of the people. </s>
<s n="s6.11;p2.14">This should span a wide range of policy areas including the basic welfare of the people, as well as global issues such as defence. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p2.14">In democratic countries, governments are elected by the people, to whom they are accountable. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p2.14">In many systems, the Government is accountable to a Parliament, whose job it is to scrutinise legislative proposals. </s>
<s n="s9.11;p2.14">Governments can be organised in many ways, but it is a common feature nowadays to have a large civil service and bureaucracy. </s>
<s n="s10.11;p2.14">Governments generally have a cabinet of ministers, each responsible for a particular policy area. </s>
<s n="s11.11;p2.14">The government is led by one person, in Britain the Prime Minister or in Germany the Chancellor, who has ultimate authority. </s>

<div1 type="section">
<head rend="italic">Broad Notions of the Role of the Commission</head>
<p n="p3.14">
<s n="s1.12;p3.14">The role and functions of the Commission by no means form a perfect parallel with the classic notion of a government. </s>
<s n="s2.12;p3.14">The Commission's official powers set out in Article 211 EC do not do justice to its real job. </s>
<s n="s3.12;p3.14">The Commission, as "a collegiate, vertically-organised institution"<ref target="BAWE_0315c-ftnote.006"/>, is at the heart of the EU and acts as its engine. </s>
<s n="s4.12;p3.14">It has a plethora of functions and is not characterised by "any rigid doctrine of separation of powers"<ref target="BAWE_0315c-ftnote.007"/>. </s>
<s n="s5.12;p3.14">Dionyssis Dimitrakopoulos<ref target="BAWE_0315c-ftnote.008"/> divides its functions into two categories. </s>
<s n="s6.12;p3.14">The first contains systemic roles, namely maintaining the EU as a credible system of governance, for instance by monitoring the implementation of the Treaty. </s>
<s n="s7.12;p3.14">The second comprises sub-systemic roles, namely policy initiation and formation. </s>
<s n="s8.12;p3.14">To achieve this, the Commission has a strong underlying philosophy, which was expounded by Jacques Delors during his presidency. </s>
<s n="s9.12;p3.14">The Commission has developed "a strong sense of Europe's destiny"<ref target="BAWE_0315c-ftnote.009"/> and is viewed as "the conscience of the Union"<ref target="BAWE_0315c-ftnote.010"/>. </s>
<s n="s10.12;p3.14">Ideologies often exist in a government and this lifts the Commission over and above the realms of a mere secretariat. </s>
<s n="s11.12;p3.14">Additionally, the Commission plays an important role in the "projection of an external EU image"<ref target="BAWE_0315c-ftnote.011"/> regarding, inter alia, trade and CFSP. This provides the EU with the requisite sense of leadership for a government. </s>
<s n="s12.12;p3.14">Additionally, it has the final say when the Council of Ministers is split and circumstances dictate that the EU must make a decision. </s>

<p n="p4.14">
<s n="s1.9;p4.14">The right to legislate is a fundamental trait of any government. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p4.14">However, the Commission's legislative role is not quite watertight. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p4.14">Although the Commission proposes legislation, the Council and European Parliament make numerous amendments in order to get laws passed. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p4.14">This echoes to a certain extent the workings of a government, in that laws need to be voted through a chamber of representatives. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p4.14">Yet, the Commission's proposals often get diluted into a form far from its original idea. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p4.14">Nevertheless, "the Commission's control of the policy agenda is formidable"<ref target="BAWE_0315c-ftnote.012"/> and it has an almost exclusive right of drafting under the First Pillar. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p4.14">Furthermore, it enjoys delegated legislative power from the Council in certain areas such as agriculture<ref target="BAWE_0315c-ftnote.013"/>. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p4.14">The Commission acts as a "motor of integration"<ref target="BAWE_0315c-ftnote.014"/> by developing the Community's overall annual legislative plan. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p4.14">However, this is a far cry from the Queen's Speech or a political party manifesto in that it is vaguer than would be expected from a true government. </s>

<s n="s5.7;p5.14">By virtue of Articles 81-88, it can investigate and decide whether a firm or a member state is in breach of Community Law. </s>

<s n="s5.6;p6.14">In reality, the bulk of the Commission's workload is administrative and there appears to be an ever-present tension between its bureaucratic and political functions. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p6.14">These administrative functions, such as drawing up and administering the budget, add weight to the argument that the Commission acts in some ways like a government for the EU. </s>

<s n="s6.9;p7.14">It is a fundamental democratic principle that judicial decisions should be independent of government interference. </s>

<s n="s1.9;p14.14">To conclude, the Commission does not have a clearly defined role, mainly because the Treaty is somewhat ambiguous on its functions and it has evolved in a "highly fragmented"<ref target="BAWE_0315c-ftnote.041"/> fashion. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p14.14">In some respects, the Commission is very like a government. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p14.14">It "fulfils many of the traditional tasks of government"<ref target="BAWE_0315c-ftnote.042"/> and these legislative and executive functions fit into the archetypal model of a cabinet of ministers and a civil service. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p14.14">However, its role as a law enforcer renders it "a curious hybrid"<ref target="BAWE_0315c-ftnote.043"/>. </s>

<s n="s6.9;p14.14">It does not carry out any front-line policy management functions that would be expected of a government. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p14.14">Neither does its method of appointment provide it with sufficient legitimacy to be well-accepted amongst the European electorate. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p14.14">Therefore, the Commission is not quite the government of EU, but it is "far more than a mere secretariat to the Council"<ref target="BAWE_0315c-ftnote.045"/>. </s>
