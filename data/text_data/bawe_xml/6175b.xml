<s n="s2.13;p75.76">These designed methods consist of the proportional control design, the Modified Ziegler-Nichols (MZN) PID control design and the Bode maximum available feedback design. </s>
<s n="s3.13;p75.76">In case of pure proportional control, the control action is simply proportional to the control error. </s>

<s n="s5.13;p75.76">Such a control method results in a large number of steady state errors as shown in the experimental results. </s>
<s n="s6.13;p75.76">The MZN PID control might be the solution to this problem. </s>
<s n="s7.13;p75.76">This control method includes the term of the integral action which is proportional to the time integral of the error. </s>
<s n="s8.13;p75.76">This experimental results show that the steady state error always becomes zero. </s>
<s n="s9.13;p75.76">The Bode maximum available feedback design method is an alternative way to design a controller. </s>
<s n="s10.13;p75.76">Based on the experimental results, the Bode maximum available feedback design method seems the best design method. </s>
<s n="s11.13;p75.76">The reason for this is that such a design method provides the lowest percent overshoot of response and also provide the fastest system except system 1 and 2 in which show that the MZN PID control is faster than the Bode maximum available feedback design method. </s>
