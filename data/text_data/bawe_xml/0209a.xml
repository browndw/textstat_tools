<s n="s1.12;p2.14">Denning's most memorable contribution was his gift to women: the 'deserted wife's equity,' an example of the fabled judicial law creation that Denning is so fondly renowned. </s>
<s n="s2.12;p2.14">When Denning was appointed, law was undergoing radical reform concerning gender equality and women's rights. </s>
<s n="s3.12;p2.14">Aged patriarchal values of male superiority were staging their last strive for survival, whilst law reform was typically unhurried. </s>
<s n="s4.12;p2.14">Women had restricted proprietary rights and the majority of title papers were in the husband's name. </s>
<s n="s5.12;p2.14">"Under the old common law as it existed until 70 years ago she had no rights at all apart from those of her husband. </s>

<ref target="BAWE_0209a-ftnote.002"/>
<s n="s7.12;p2.14">When a husband deserted his wife, she had no legal right to remain in the home, Denning commenting: "I could see an injustice, it cried out for a remedy." </s>
<s n="s8.12;p2.14">His first reform opportunity was in H v H<ref target="BAWE_0209a-ftnote.003"/> where a deserted wife was threatened with eviction when the husband wanted to sell their matrimonial home. </s>
<s n="s9.12;p2.14">In an act of pure judicial creativity, Denning "did not cite a single case" and "dealt with it on principle,"<ref target="BAWE_0209a-ftnote.004"/> claiming that "at common law the husband has no right to turn the wife out of the house," and that "he has no right in law to claim possession except under S17 Married Women's Property Act 1882." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0209a-ftnote.005"/>
<s n="s10.12;p2.14">Whilst the decision grasped the just principle it stood alone, unprecedented and heavily reliant on S17 entitling judges to "make such an order with respect to property in dispute as he thinks fit." </s>

<s n="s6.8;p3.14">This was a fictitious creation. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p3.14">Furthermore, Bendall exaggerates protection, the right becoming binding on successors in title; in this instance the trustee of the husbands bankruptcy, Denning deciding that "of all the creditors, she has the most crying claim of all." </s>

<s n="s1.6;p10.14">Denning contributed immensely to the development of women's rights in the home, akin to his work for the 'deserted wife's equity.' </s>
<s n="s2.6;p10.14">Where issues continued for deserted wives, normal women were gaining a right in the home despite registration in the husbands' name, with Denning at the forefront. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p10.14">The first achievement was establishing a share in the proceeds of sale for the wife, Denning protesting against his fellows in Hoddinott v Hoddinott<ref target="BAWE_0209a-ftnote.032"/> where the court ruled that wife's would not receive any proceeds unless contracted to do so. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p10.14">Denning effectively overruled this, disregarding the doctrine of precedent, and stating that "beneficial interests in the matrimonial, or furniture, belongs to one or the other absolutely, or it is clear that they intended to hold it in definite shares. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p10.14">The court will give effect to these intentions;" striking an accommodating approach. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p10.14">In Rimmer v Rimmer<ref target="BAWE_0209a-ftnote.033"/>, Denning ruled to give equal share; this was fair as she had made substantial mortgage repayments, the decision effectively giving the courts a free hand. </s>

<s n="s1.14;p11.14">Subsequent progression established women a share in the house, however precedent was restricting: "The wife had right to the house or any share in it unless she could show a contract by the husband with her or a gift by him to her or a trust by him for her in regard to it." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0209a-ftnote.034"/>
<s n="s2.14;p11.14">Denning disregarded this stating, "I do think that line of argument is valid today...in many cases...the intention of the parties is not clear... the court has to attribute an intention to them,"<ref target="BAWE_0209a-ftnote.035"/> again affording the judge a 'free hand.' </s>
<s n="s3.14;p11.14">Denning's approach is refreshingly realistic for the period, suggesting that when living together "it does not matter who does the saving or the spending or payments:" you intend to "live together for the rest of your lives." </s>
<s n="s4.14;p11.14">His application ensured justice in a good many cases, e.g. </s>
<s n="s5.14;p11.14">Rimmer v Rimmer<ref target="BAWE_0209a-ftnote.036"/> and he extended and justified the principle once again by using S17 MWPA<ref target="BAWE_0209a-ftnote.037"/> in Appleton v Appelton,<ref target="BAWE_0209a-ftnote.038"/> similar to the deserted wife's equity. </s>
<s n="s6.14;p11.14">He stated "... </s>
<s n="s7.14;p11.14">I prefer to take the simple test: What is reasonable and fair in the circumstances as they have developed, seeing that they are circumstances which no one contemplated before?" </s>
<s n="s8.14;p11.14">This is Denning in his element, deciding the just result, then grappling for tool to implement it: creative but mischievous. </s>
<s n="s9.14;p11.14">S17 affords complete discretion, ideal justification where law fails to provide adequate provisions. </s>
<s n="s10.14;p11.14">At this period there was radical social adjustment, women's rights markedly enlarged but law reacted lethargically, still supporting old patriarchal values: the social segregation and suppression of women. </s>
<s n="s11.14;p11.14">Denning was their hope, and whilst he abused his power, the greater good was worthwhile. </s>
<s n="s12.14;p11.14">Yet Denning moved too far, perhaps deliberately. </s>
<s n="s13.14;p11.14">The test was too broad and on appeal in the Lords, whilst agreeing that "the principle he sought to establish was fair in all circumstances that it had happened"<ref target="BAWE_0209a-ftnote.039"/> S17 was only procedural: the test was questioned. </s>
<s n="s14.14;p11.14">Yet Denning and the Appeal court continued to use it, such as in Pettitt v Pettitt<ref target="BAWE_0209a-ftnote.040"/> and later Gissing v Gissing<ref target="BAWE_0209a-ftnote.041"/> believing it "fair and just."<ref target="BAWE_0209a-ftnote.042"/> </s>
