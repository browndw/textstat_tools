<s n="s4.5;p25.27">Gruen<ref target="BAWE_6211d-ftnote.035"/> states that it was written by an Egyptian Jew in the early Roman Empire. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p25.27">I would also agree with the scholars who advocate the First Century AD because of the style of the polemic against idolatry. </s>

<p n="p27.27">
<s n="s1.3;p27.27">To conclude, the Wisdom of Solomon appears to be a text written by an Egyptian Jew in Greek during the First Century AD. The literary style is very much Hellenistic while the ideas contained within it appear to be a blend of Greek, Jewish and Egyptian ideas. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p27.27">Jewish identity is expressed both by means of open criticism of other cultures and assertions of Jewish values. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p27.27">The general concept of piety included the search for Wisdom, by means of an undying devotion to a God who had never failed his people and taught them the secrets of heaven to those who were pure enough. </s>
