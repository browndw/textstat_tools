<list type="simple">
<item>Severity: High</item>
<item>Heuristic: Accommodation: Style</item>
<item>Learnability: Visibility</item>
<item>Description: The design of the first page is simple but not very clear. It is written with usage of easy scripts and does not contain much graphics nor sophisticated flash animations. This solution enables the quick loading and browsing of the website but makes it very unstylish. Unfortunately also the composition of data gathered on this page makes it very hard to find appropriate information. The composition is inconsistent and contains of plain text (different fonts and sizes), tables and picture. The title of home page : "Faculty of Engineering and computing </item>
<item>ROOM / STAFF LOCATOR " does not even fit the blue space provided for it. It all looks like a big untidiness and mixtures of styles. What is more there is a lot of unused white space on both sides of the screen.</item>
<item>Solution: Redesign the website to make it more attractive and user satisfying. Try to make few sub pages instead of using one page that contain all information, e.g. separate sub page for each floor or institute.</item>
<item>Rationale: The design of this website is unattractive and therefore use of it will not be satisfying for the potential user. Try to encourage users to browse the website by making it more stylish. </item>

<head rend="bold italic">Staff list</head>
<list type="simple">
<item>Severity: Medium</item>
<item>Heuristics: Ease of Use: Navigation</item>
<item>Description: Staff list is a table with names and details of staff members working in Armstrong Siddeley building. The names in the left column are not links except from "S.Amin" which should be a link to his lecturer page. Unfortunately this link does not work.</item>
<item>Solution: Delete the link from "S.Amin" as system users are not supposed to browse Internet pages. Possibly add the links to the other names and change the linking address for "S.Amin" but I do not think that is useful in our system. I would suggest adding a link which will directly take user to the Building map and show him/her a way to selected staff member.</item>
<item>Rationale: The home pages are not helpful in finding a way to lecturers' rooms.</item>

<item>Heuristics: Learnability: Consistency</item>
<item>Description: On the home page there is a page title at the top unfortunately when user clicks on the link to ground floor map this title disappears</item>
<item>Solution: Add page title to all sub pages.</item>
<item>Rationale: This page changes to completely new when user clicks on the link. Beside the user who will approach the system when one of the floor maps is already opened does not know which floor's map it is.</item>

<head rend="bold italic">Finding a room</head>
<list type="simple">
<item>Severity: Medium</item>
<item>Heuristics: Accommodation: Conviviality</item>
<item>Description: The system is extremely unusable. Right now the user has to find the name on the list first and make a note with appropriate room number. Than the user has to figure out from the room number the appropriate floor. Finally user has to find appropriate link and find the room on the floor map. This can be a cause of mistakes, as the system bases on user memory and skills. It does not do anything to help the user.</item>
<item>Solution: Change the system of finding room of staff member. Let system do the hard work of matching the name with room number and make it display appropriate map with highlighted proper room and directions.</item>
<item>Rationale: System should not rely on the user, it should work the other way round. We cannot make user to be used by system. We cannot demand that the user will have a pen, paper, and the most important time to manually find the room in the system.</item>

<div3>
<head rend="bold italic">Menu</head>
<list type="simple">
<item>Severity: High</item>
<item>Heuristics: Ease of Use: Navigation</item>
<item>Description: After clicking on the link to ground floor map there is no way to go back, to change floor or whatsoever. The only way to go back is to click on browser "Back" button.</item>
<item>Solution: Add a side menu with Home page link, floor links and search link.</item>
<item>Rationale: This is a very simple page and it does not need a lot of effort to navigate it properly. To achieve that system will need a search engine, as it operates on data base and side menu which will allow user to change currently displayed content.</item>
