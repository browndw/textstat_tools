<s n="s3.5;p28.80">Renolds peers are likely to be in a similar position to Renold over current affairs, hence relying on debt financing. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p28.80">It could of course always mean the companies are in the process of expanding, or undergoing some major change. </s>

<s n="s3.6;p30.80">This decrease will reduce the number of investors; hence drive the share price down. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p30.80">However the dividend yield is also related to the markets perception of future growth prospect for the firm. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p30.80">The lower dividend yields could signify the company is looking to invest more money in growth, i.e. increased development in china. </s>

<s n="s3.4;p31.80">This is a promising sign and will encourage shareholders. </s>

<p n="p32.80">
<s n="s1.4;p32.80">The negative interest cover ratio in 2005 is likely to be due to heavy borrowing to fund the increased development in china, restructuring and acquisitions. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p32.80">In previous years the interest cover has been high, ~3.5 in 2004, showing the company to be in a sound financial position. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p32.80">This was probably the reason for the numerous investments that took place, however the PLC did not predict the decline in markets and currency, and increase in costs. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p32.80">The value in 2005 of below 1 demonstrates that interest cover is insufficient to cope with outgoing financial expenses, which will worry shareholders. </s>

<s n="s2.6;p33.80">This shows that Renold have an insufficient debt collection procedure. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p33.80">However the PLC is likely to do a lot of business on credit and so this high collection period is deemed acceptable with the UK average for credit payments being ~70 days. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p33.80">The drop in collection time in 2005 is a good sign and will encourage shareholders as it shows the company is becoming more efficient. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p33.80">However this decrease could also be to do with the financial problems the company encountered this year. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p34.80">Fixed asset turnover has been increasing steadily throughout the past 5 years. </s>

<s n="s3.4;p35.80">A summary of revisions due to this policy can be seen on P51 of the Annual Report. </s>
