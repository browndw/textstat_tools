<s n="s1.1;p5.15">Psychologists at Middlesex University and the University of Sussex have been researching whether a students' worries about their finances and debt has an impact on their mental health. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.15">
<s n="s1.3;p6.15">In their study, students were asked to put statements such as "I worry about my financial situation" on a scale indicating how much they agree to the statement. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p6.15">This allowed the researchers to assess attitudes towards finances. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p6.15">They were also asked questions that looked at various aspect of mental health such as happiness, depression and vitality. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.15">

<hi rend="bold">'Many students are anxious about top-up fees and...debt'</hi> Kat Fletcher NUS National President</quote>
<quote lang="English">Sian Davies, NUS Students with Disabilities' Officer said, "Previous research has estimated that between 30% and 50% of students suffer from a mental health problem at some point during their time at University, a level far higher than the national average of 1 in 4. If this higher average is contributed to by financial concerns then the long term picture for students' mental health is a bleak one."</quote>
<p n="p11.15">
<s n="s1.1;p11.15">Highlighted in the published paper is the fact that government policies appear to contradict themselves, on the one hand promising to reduce inequity in health and on the other creating policy that may seriously affect students mental health. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.15">
<s n="s1.1;p12.15">Recommendations made by the psychologists suggest that the government needs to take a greater responsibility to ensure students positive mental health and well being. </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.15">
<s n="s1.1;p13.15">With student debts estimated to reach an average of £30,000 by the academic year 2009/10, it is almost certain given trends already seen through national research that worries of debt and an inability to manage finances will increase. </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.15">
<s n="s1.2;p14.15">The past few months have also seen a decrease in the number of applications to University for this September. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p14.15">Many critics of new funding policies for higher education believe that this is primarily due to the increase in the cost of the tuition fees that students will be liable for. </s>
</p>
<quote lang="English">NUS president Kat Fletcher said, "The expected drop in applications is extremely concerning. Many students are anxious about top-up fees and the debt they will face having completed their studies."</quote>
<p n="p15.15">
<s n="s1.1;p15.15">With a link now proven between financial worries and mental health problems, it seems essential to follow up on the recommendations provided by the psychologists in order to ensure the mental well being of future generations of students. </s>
