<p n="p2.45">
<s n="s1.1;p2.45">I will discuss the policies in 4 areas. </s>

<div2>
<head>2.1 Economic growth</head>
<p n="p3.45">
<s n="s1.2;p3.45">The economic growth is the percentage increased in real national output in a given time period. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p3.45">Given the importance of the economic growth in reducing poverty and improving living standard, ensuring a sustained growth is a key priority for every country. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.45">
<s n="s1.3;p4.45">In the classical model, the total output is supply determined. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p4.45">The strong assumption of price and wage perfect flexibility implies the total output always equals to the potential output. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p4.45">Classical economists believe "free markets are inherently self-stabilising", thus any attempts of intervention will only "mess things up". </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.45">
<s n="s1.2;p5.45">In contrast another more realistic "fixed price model" suggests that the output is demand determined and can deviate from the potential output. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p5.45">When the economy is in recession, an expansion in fiscal policy can shift aggregate demand curve to the right(AD1) by increasing government spending(see dig.1), and the multiplier effect will generate higher output in the short term by△y=△G/1-b(1-t) where b =marginal propensity to consume, c=current tax rate. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.45">
<s n="s1.1;p6.45">In December, the chancellor announced the PBR, forecasting GDP growth of 3.25% this year (see dig2) and said in his pre-budget speech: "Britain will extend the longest period of uninterrupted growth in the industrial history of our country". </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.45">
<s n="s1.1;p7.45">However, the 2004 annual economic summary from national statistics points out "UK economic growth has continued to be primarily driven by government expenditure and household consumer spending" .UK budget deficit has increased from 1.53% of GDP (2002) to 2.94%(2004), and it may exceed the limit set by the euro zone of 3% by 2005. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.45">
<s n="s1.4;p8.45">In the fixed price model, the increased output might be less than the full multiplier effect in the long run due to the crowing out effects. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p8.45">Governments often borrow money (by issuing bonds) to fund the additional spending. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p8.45">Therefore in dia.1, the MD shifts to right and forces the interest rate increasing, which "crowds out" the private investments because of the higher costs for the borrowing. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p8.45">Correspondingly the AD1 curve shifts back to AD2 and responds to a lower output. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.45">
<s n="s1.4;p9.45">An alternative way to stimulate the depressed economy is loose monetary policy. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p9.45">In the money market, if the central bank lowered its lending interest rate to R1 by raising the money supply (dig3), the borrowing for private investment is more attractive and result in shifting LM1 curve to the rightLM2. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p9.45">In the goods market, the AD1 curve will correspondingly shift to AD2 thus the total output increases. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p9.45">In the long term, the expanding aggregate demand may lead to the higher demand for the money by shifting the MD1 curve to the right MD2, and the interest rate will rise to R2 which is still lower than R1. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.45">
<s n="s1.1;p10.45">The UK current interest rate is 4.75%, and it is considered to be quite high and uncompetitive for the UK manufacturing industry and the retailers compared to the other countries with lower interest rate. </s>

<head>2.2 Employment </head>
<p n="p11.45">

<s n="s3.4;p11.45">In dig.4, it shows the increase in demand for output will require more labour demand. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p11.45">The wage stickiness and price rigidity imply there are exists the possibility of "involuntary" unemployment. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.45">

<p n="p15.45">
<s n="s1.2;p15.45">·Tax reforms: Taking Corporation tax for instance, a reduction of the tax rate may encourages more private investment as a result of greater profitability. </s>

</p>
<p n="p16.45">
<s n="s1.2;p16.45">·Transfer payment adjustment: An increase in unemployment benefit, social security benefits, and welfare payment will boost the aggregate demand. </s>

<s n="s3.5;p18.45">As a result of higher domestic investment will offer more jobs in labour market. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p18.45">In the 2004 pre-budget report, the chancellor announced the implementation of the changes recommended by the Graham Review of the Small Firms' Loan Guarantee by end 2005 to encourage more private investments. </s>

<s n="s2.3;p30.45">An early example was the Medium-Term Financial Strategy implemented by Mrs. Thatcher, which involved planned reduction in public spending in 4 to 5 years. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p30.45">The lower government spending will shift the AD (dig5) downward, so the exceeding demand can be eliminated. </s>
</p>
<p n="p31.45">
<s n="s1.1;p31.45">However, the contractionary fiscal policy is unpopular from the political consideration since the shift back of AD curve may cause the economic recession. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p32.45">In May 1997, Labour government decided to move decisively to establish the independence of the Bank of England. </s>

<s n="s3.4;p33.45">In the IS-LM mode (see dig7), the higher interest rate will cause additional demand for the money, which will shift LM curve upward hence lower price in good market. </s>

<head>2.4 Balance of payment</head>

<s n="s1.3;p34.45">Balance of payment is an accounting record of all transactions made by a country. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p34.45">The most frequently used component is the merchandise trade balance, which is defined as the difference between a nation's exports and imports. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p34.45">Based on the data provided by the national statistics, The UK's deficit on trade in goods and services worsened in October 2004 to stand at £3.8 billion -compared with the deficit for September of £2.9 billion. </s>
</p>
<p n="p35.45">
<s n="s1.6;p35.45">In an open economy, the government can affects trade balance and exchange rate. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p35.45">In the case of fiscal expansion, such as growing public investment and the government subsidies, the corresponding upward shifting IS curve (dig7) will engender a increasing aggregate demand at a higher interest rate R1. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p35.45">In the short-term, the current account maybe worse off. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p35.45">This is because, firstly the demand for imports is proportional to aggregate demand, where the extend depends on the marginal propensity to import, and secondly, the raising interest rate pushes down the exchange rate, leading to the more expensive exports. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p35.45">This effect of fiscal policy was central to discussions of the "twin deficits" (budget and trade) theory. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p35.45">Nevertheless, if the competitiveness of the UK exports can be enhanced as a result of the developing technology and labour productivity in the long term, it should give a boost to the export demand due to the cheaper cost and the better quality. </s>
</p>
<p n="p36.45">
<s n="s1.2;p36.45">Besides, the government can also raise tariff barriers against foreign good. </s>

</p>
<p n="p37.45">
<s n="s1.5;p37.45">For the monetary policy, the central bank may consider depreciate the domestic currency by lowering interest rate. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p37.45">As the LM curve shifts downward (dig 8), the higher exchange rate indicates the dearer importer and cheaper exports. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p37.45">But it doesn't necessarily reduce the trade deficit because the expanding aggregate demand also implies more demand for the imports. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p37.45">So the effectiveness of the policy is ambiguous. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p37.45">It depends on the marginal propensity to imports and price elasticity of the exports. </s>
