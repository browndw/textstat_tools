<quote lang="English">"Monopoly is inefficient... Of course, I already knew that. Monopolists are rich and lazy; they have no competitors to put pressure on them, so they run their firms badly." (Friedman, D. 1986) </quote>
<p n="p1.16">
<s n="s1.5;p1.16">This quote, as cited by David Friedman, encapsulates a dominant, traditional view of monopolised markets and industries. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p1.16">This negative perception stems from the productive, allocative and welfare inefficiencies associated with the monopoly 'price making' structure, whereby the quantity and price are set equal to marginal cost, (P=MC) resulting in artificially high prices, under production and the extraction by the monopolist of supernormal profits; overall, leading to economic inefficiency. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p1.16">However, there are some economists and theorists of today who disagree with the traditional conception of monopoly economic inefficiency. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p1.16">Using ideas drawn from neo-classical theory and the work of economists such as Joseph A Schumpeter, this essay aims to address the extent to which monopolies can actually induce economic efficiency. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p1.16">The factors of vertical integration, horizontal market contestability, technology, the role of advertising and market demand elasticity, as laid out above in the problematic, will be used as tools to structure this essay and hence analyse the extent to which monopoly can induce economic efficiency. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.16">
<s n="s1.16;p2.16">A firm which is involved in more than one successive stage of production is said to be 'vertically integrated'. </s>
<s n="s2.16;p2.16">According to European Union Competition policy vertical integration <hi rend="italic">may</hi> result in the exploitation of further economies of scale, cost savings, lower prices and hence increased productive efficiency. </s>

<seg type="URL" n="www.tutor2u.net/economics"/>)</hi> The implicit ambiguity contained in this statement leads onto the question of why a firm may jeopardise existing efficiency levels in order to vertically integrate. </s>
<s n="s5.16;p2.16">Jeffrey Perloff claims that "if a firm can perform most of the necessary stages of production at lower cost than it would incur buying from other firms, it would vertically integrate." </s>
<s n="s6.16;p2.16">(Perloff, J., 2001, p.530) Firms will take into account the increased costs associated with integration, such as management costs and legal fees, in addition to the extra costs of the increased production. </s>
<s n="s7.16;p2.16">If the benefits of integration, in the form of economies of scale cost savings for example, outweigh these costs, the firm will integrate, thereby increasing economic efficiency in the form of lower costs potentially higher outputs and possibly lower prices for consumers. </s>
<s n="s8.16;p2.16">Perloff identifies a number of further benefits firms accrue from integration. </s>
<s n="s9.16;p2.16">Firstly, vertical integration lowers 'Transaction costs'. </s>
<s n="s10.16;p2.16">These are the costs associated with trading with other firms, such as contractual costs and prices of goods. </s>
<s n="s11.16;p2.16">Asymmetric information, under non-integration, also keeps costs higher. </s>
<s n="s12.16;p2.16">For example, non-integrated firms may incur these costs in monitoring the quality control of the goods they are purchasing from sellers in order for production. </s>
<s n="s13.16;p2.16">However, integration can overcome these costs, through internal quality control management. </s>
<s n="s14.16;p2.16">Secondly, vertical integration increases stability for companies. </s>
<s n="s15.16;p2.16">Relying on upstream firms to maintain a steady supply and price of stock, can cause instability; there are no fixed guarantees that the required goods will be delivered on time and meet the required quality control standards. </s>
<s n="s16.16;p2.16">Vertical integration can overcome this problem. </s>

<s n="s1.11;p4.16">These efficiencies described above, are directly associated with the process of vertical integration itself. </s>
<s n="s2.11;p4.16">However, vertical integration in certain market structures can increase efficiency further. </s>
<s n="s3.11;p4.16">For Neo-Classical economists, vertical integration is perceived as a response to inefficiencies associated with monopoly market power in both 'upstream' and 'downstream' markets, leading to what is known as 'double marginalisation'. </s>
<s n="s4.11;p4.16">From our knowledge of monopoly's, we know that they set P=MC in order to extract supernormal profits. </s>
<s n="s5.11;p4.16">Fig 1. demonstrates the pricing strategy of a monopoly. </s>
<s n="s6.11;p4.16">The shaded area between Average Cost (AC) and the price paid by consumers (D = P*) represents the supernormal profits obtained by the firm under this pricing strategy. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p4.16">Double marginalisation arises through the failure of the 'downstream' firm to take the 'marginal pricing strategy' of the 'upstream' firm into account and hence engage in a marginal pricing strategy of its own, resulting in unnaturally high consumer prices. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p4.16">Jean Tirole refers to this inefficiency as a 'Vertical Externality'. </s>
<s n="s9.11;p4.16">(Joskow, P., 2005, p.5) Aggregate profits are lower under double marginalisation than for the vertically integrated structure, which provides the incentive to firms to integrate and hence remove this negative externality. </s>
<s n="s10.11;p4.16">According to Joskow: "prices charged to consumers will fall and, as a result, consumers are made better off by vertical; integration." </s>

<s n="s1.8;p6.16">Vertical integration can also improve efficiency in structures where the 'upstream firm' is a monopoly and downstream structure is characterised by competition. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p6.16">In this case, according to economists such as Graham and Vernon (1971) an upstream monopolist, attempting to extract supernormal profits by setting prices above marginal cost, will in fact cause the downstream, competitive firms to substitute away from the monopoly products, resulting in inefficient production at the next stage. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p6.16">(Cited in Schmalensee, R., 1973, p.442) Vertical integration internalizes marginal cost pricing, allowing the firm to overcome this inefficiency and "restore an efficient utilization of inputs used in the production of the downstream good or service". </s>
<s n="s4.8;p6.16">(Joskow, P., 2005, p.7) From the evidence laid out above, it appears that vertical integration in some cases can induce some level of economic efficiency. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p6.16">According to Tirole, the welfare and efficiency derived depends on the motivation behind vertical integration. (<hi rend="underlined">
<seg type="URL" n="www.med.govt.nz"/>)</hi> Similarly, Joskow advocates efficiency motivations for vertical integration in favour of foreclosure (anti-trust) motivations. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p6.16">Furthermore, the European Union Competition Policy states that: "when companies combine via merger, this generally has a positive impact on markets: firms usually become more efficient, competition intensifies and the final consumer will benefit from higher quality goods at fairer prices. </s>

<s n="s1.11;p7.16">The level of contestability within a market can also be an indicator of or even an incentive for monopoly's to induce higher levels of economic efficiency. </s>
<s n="s2.11;p7.16">William Baumol (1922) defines contestable markets as those "where an entrant has access to all production techniques available to all incumbents, is not prohibited from wooing the incumbents customers, and entry decisions can be reversed without cost." (<seg type="URL" n="www.edexcel.org.uk/VirtualContent/70279.pdf"/> p.8) </s>
<s n="s3.11;p7.16">The logic behind the theory suggests that the more contestable the market, i.e. the easier to enter and exit, the more incentive there is for firms to 'enter' or 'exit' the market as freely as they wish. </s>
<s n="s4.11;p7.16">Markets where incumbent firms are making supernormal profits (Fig 2, The dotted rectangle, Q1, PM) create extremely high incentives for outsider firms to enter the market, under cutting the incumbents prices, extract supernormal profits and the incumbents' entire market share, before exiting the market without incurring any sunk costs (Fig 2, market share = shaded pink rectangle PN) . </s>
<s n="s5.11;p7.16">These are known as 'hit and run tactics'. </s>
<s n="s6.11;p7.16">Therefore, it follows that in a contestable market, even if the incumbent firm has monopolised the market, it may not exercise its power, i.e. through high prices and restricted output to gain high profits, in order to try and prevent 'outsiders' from entering. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p7.16">The rationale behind this being that the dominance of the market, but with normal profits is better than no profit or market share at all. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p7.16">To demonstrate this idea in terms of real life application, the Office of Fair Trading in the UK surveys the contestability of markets when analysing the potentiality of a firm to dominate through exertion of market power, thereby suggesting that if a market is contestable, even a firm operating as a monopoly poses little threat to operate in an economically inefficient manner. (<seg type="URL" n="www.edexcel.org.uk/VirtualContent/70279.pdf"/> p.8) </s>
<s n="s9.11;p7.16">However, the extent to which a monopoly will refrain from operating at a profit maximising level, in order to deter entry into a market is heavily contested by some economists. </s>
<s n="s10.11;p7.16">For them, it would make more sense to maximise profits until new firms enter the market. </s>
<s n="s11.11;p7.16">It is only at this point that the incumbent monopoly should drop its prices, in order to squeeze the new entrants out of the market. </s>

<s n="s7.12;p8.16">Monopoly will invest in ever increasingly efficient modes of production, even if this means disregarding previously used resources, because "competition from innovations is an ever-present threat that disciplines before it attacks."

<s n="s7.9;p9.16">Dr. Donghyun Park, in his paper "Advertising and the Meaning of Competition.", uses the analogy of voting behaviour to illustrate this point: "Just as informed voters are better able to place better qualified candidates in office, better informed consumers are better able to reward more efficient firms and punish less efficient firms" by either purchasing or not purchasing their goods. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p10.16">As monopoly faces a downward sloping demand curve, when performing under single pricing strategy, a net 'deadweight welfare loss' to society is created, that is the output that is lost in a market characterised by monopoly rather than perfect competition. </s>

<s n="s4.11;p15.16">From this it is clear to see that the change in quantity demanded in response to a change in price is relatively small when compared to the more elastic market, which is characterised by a flatter demand curve. </s>
