Once again it is the father figure of Mr. Knightley who reprimands Emma's bad behaviour out of genuine concern for her. </s>

<s n="s3.7;p10.27">The winter becomes the spring. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p10.27">The change of season signals hope, as spring is a conventional image of youth and regeneration, supporting the idea that all is not lost. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p10.27">This splitting up of the play explains the term tragicomedy. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p10.27">In comparison, at the end of Chapter VII, Volume III, Emma feels she has reached her lowest point and reveals 'she never had been so depressed':'Time did not compose her. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p12.27">Chapter VII, Volume III is the most emotional and dramatic chapter concerning the feelings and thoughts of Emma the reader has yet seen. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p12.27">Due to the disapproval of Knightley, Emma actually sheds 'tears' at the end of the chapter. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p12.27">Austen uses direct narrative to portray Emma's true feelings and describes the situation through Emma's perspective. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p12.27">Even though the omniscient narrator uses third person, the reader feels closely related to Emma at this point in the novel as the language used is that of which one can imagine Emma using herself. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p12.27">The reader feels as though they are looking into Emma's mind and can immediately observe what her thoughts are. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p12.27">Due to the surprising misery Knightley's reprimand has on Emma, it is perhaps this specific point in the novel when Emma's feelings towards Knightley are made clear to the reader and even to herself. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p12.27">It is obvious how highly she regards Knightley's opinions and due to this idea, this chapter may mark the turning point and the beginning to the path of self- understanding and lead her to what she really desires. </s>

<p n="p13.27">
<s n="s1.2;p13.27">In parallel, Leontes in Act 3, Scene 2, realises his awful mistakes and therefore can move forward from these. </s>
