<div2>
<head rend="bold">Segmenting into Releases</head>
<p n="p8.60">
<s n="s1.2;p8.60">It maybe possible that although the client's date is absolute, the entire project does not need to be finished at the same time e.g. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p8.60">Client management may not exactly need to use the Produce patients system letters until the next financial quarter. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.60">
<s n="s1.1;p9.60">Risks: </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.60">
<s n="s1.2;p10.60">Need to be careful in approaching the client. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p10.60">If it appears that OPUS are proposing to enter production with an incomplete system, they will simply reject OPUS. Nobody wants to risk business on something that is not finished. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.60">
<s n="s1.1;p11.60">Risk mitigation: </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.60">
<s n="s1.2;p12.60">Client can be educated about release development, a process in which a system is developed and implemented in self-contained chunks e.g. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p12.60">Produce patients records is not unfinished; it is a complete release of a system to which subsequent releases will add further functionality. </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.60">
<s n="s1.1;p13.60">Concept of release development to align the schedule by defining releases to include </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.60">
<s n="s1.3;p14.60">whatever is required by the absolute date. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p14.60">Anything the client agrees can be deferred goes into release 2 (or release 3). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p14.60">If you can complete release 1 by the required date, OPUS has successfully aligned the project to your client's requirements (and contract). </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="bold">Reduce Functionality</head>
<p n="p15.60">
<s n="s1.3;p15.60">If the date is absolute and cannot be segmented the system into releases, it may be possible to compress the schedule by reducing functionality. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p15.60">This is another type of release development in which release 1 contains all the components of the complete system scaled down to a lower level of functionality. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p15.60">Subsequent releases will enhance the system to the full functional levels that were originally planned. </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.60">
<s n="s1.3;p16.60">To reduce functionality, step through all the deliverables with the client and identify sections or pieces that are not absolutely necessary. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p16.60">It is vital that you enroll the client in this process. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p16.60">First, the client must </s>
</p>
<p n="p17.60">
<s n="s1.2;p17.60">understand why the system is being cut back. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p17.60">Second, only the client can identify functionality that can be deferred. </s>
</p>
<p n="p18.60">
<s n="s1.1;p18.60">Risks: </s>
</p>
<p n="p19.60">
<s n="s1.1;p19.60">Same as segmenting into Releases. </s>

</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="bold">Additional Staff to the team</head>
<p n="p22.60">
<s n="s1.3;p22.60">Another approach to aligning the schedule is to assign additional staff either internal or external. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p22.60">E.g. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p22.60">Adding two more systems analyst and two programmer to the project team to speed up the activities. </s>
</p>
<p n="p23.60">
<s n="s1.1;p23.60">Risks: </s>
</p>
<p n="p24.60">
<s n="s1.2;p24.60">Depends upon the availability of other staff or potential employees, as and the extent to which the activities are independent of one another. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p24.60">May take time to hire a new person and the person will take time to adopt to the OPUS culture and project activities. </s>
</p>
<p n="p25.60">
<s n="s1.1;p25.60">Risk mitigation: </s>
</p>
<p n="p26.60">
<s n="s1.2;p26.60">Plan early. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p26.60">Adding people is more realistic if planned to have done at the beginning than if the requirement appears after the project has started </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="bold">Subcontracting</head>
<p n="p27.60">
<s n="s1.4;p27.60">One way to spread the work over more people is to subcontract (our source) part of the project to another company that specializes in systems development. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p27.60">"The productivity of focused companies can be as much as 100 percent greater than that of their larger, more structured counterparts". </s>
<s n="s3.4;p27.60">In a tight project, they can sometimes provide the boost that the project needs. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p27.60">This approach maybe more be expensive, but meeting the schedule may be worth it especially when considering follow-up business with NHS. </s>
</p>
<p n="p28.60">
<s n="s1.1;p28.60">Risks: </s>
</p>
<p n="p29.60">
<s n="s1.1;p29.60">May not deliver on time or up to the required quality. </s>
</p>
<p n="p30.60">
<s n="s1.1;p30.60">Risk mitigation: </s>
</p>
<p n="p31.60">
<s n="s1.1;p31.60">Carefully evaluate the subcontractors and plan early. </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="bold">Encourage, motivate, reward and provide flexibility to the team</head>
<p n="p32.60">
<s n="s1.2;p32.60">Another approach is to get company's permission to ignore office standards, conventions, bureaucratic paperwork (maybe even time consuming QA paper work but subjected to careful review), or any other corporate demands in a focused attempt to get the job done correctly. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p32.60">If, for example, bringing the team physically together would help but the company policy is for individuals to work at their assigned desks, request space dedicated to the project and bring the team together. </s>
</p>
<p n="p33.60">
<s n="s1.1;p33.60">e.g. if the hot shot programmers are more productive working from 6pm-5a.m wearing jeans and a T-shirts with explicit text, give them the opportunity and block any attempt by the company's HR to intervene. </s>
</p>
<p n="p34.60">
<s n="s1.1;p34.60">If team members wasting time on company's meeting, employee evaluations and even disciplinary action ask that they be excused for the duration (for the sake of the project). </s>
</p>
<p n="p35.60">
<s n="s1.1;p35.60">Risks: </s>
</p>
<p n="p36.60">
<s n="s1.1;p36.60">If full team commitment cannot be gain it is of no use and may escalate to internal battles which may hinder the project e.g. continuous harassment and annoyance that will shift the team's concentration away from the project. </s>
</p>
<p n="p37.60">
<s n="s1.1;p37.60">HR department may not cooperate. </s>
</p>
<p n="p38.60">
<s n="s1.1;p38.60">Risk mitigation: </s>
</p>
<p n="p39.60">
<s n="s1.1;p39.60">Apply HR techniques such as above to get the maximum output from the team. </s>
</p>
<p n="p40.60">
<s n="s1.7;p40.60">"But these organizations miss the fact that Microsoft and other successful commitment-oriented companies don't require overtime. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p40.60">They hire people who love to create software. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p40.60">They team these people with other people who love to create software just as much as they do. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p40.60">They provide lavish organizational support and rewards for creating software. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p40.60">And then they turn them loose. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p40.60">The natural outcome is that software developers and managers choose to work long hours voluntarily. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p40.60">Imposter organizations confuse the effect (long hours) with the cause (high motivation)" </s>

</div2>

<head rend="bold">Use/Buy CASE tools</head>
<p n="p41.60">
<s n="s1.2;p41.60">Use of CASE tools can significantly improve the efficiency and productivity of the project e.g. usage of automated testing software for stress testing will cut down lot of time and effort in developing in-house stress testing programs. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p41.60">The packages maybe expensive especially specialised ones, however it's well worth while if it cuts down effort and time significantly. </s>

<p n="p42.60">
<s n="s1.1;p42.60">Risks: </s>
</p>
<p n="p43.60">
<s n="s1.1;p43.60">Off the shelf packages may not meet the exact requirements and actually take more time in customising or worse provide false data. </s>
