<head rend="underlined bold">Conclusions</head>
<p n="p19.34">
<s n="s1.2;p19.34">From the experiment I think that glycerol is a Newtonian fluid because from 3 RPM onwards, the viscosity was generally constant at both increasing and decreasing speeds. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p19.34">An explanation for why the velocity increased and decreased for increasing and decreasing speeds respectively may be that the spindle head may just have been slipping across the liquid rather than moving it, as the slow spindle head was not enough to move the strong cross links in the liquid. </s>
</p>
<p n="p20.34">
<s n="s1.3;p20.34">I think that the 1% guar gum is not a Newtonian fluid because the viscosity changed with speed. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p20.34">As with the glycerol, the spindle may have been slipping across the strong crosslinking at slow speeds. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p20.34">Towards the end of the experiment, at between 1.5 RPM and 0.3 RPM at decreasing speeds, the strong crosslinking may have began to be broken, giving a high viscosity reading. </s>
