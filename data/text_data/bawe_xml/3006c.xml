<s n="s2.7;p3.15">Modernism rejected previously established forms and artistic ideals. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p3.15">Evident in <hi rend="italic">The Waste Land</hi> is the breakdown of chronology in literature and the shift towards the process of reflection.<hi rend="italic"> The Waste Land</hi> has been linked with James Joyce's <hi rend="italic">Ulysses</hi> as well as with non-literary works, which share aspects that allow us to identify them as being Modernist works of art. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p3.15">Such works "originally signified cultural disruption and radically new ways of interpreting the world". </s>
<s n="s5.7;p3.15">However, readings of <hi rend="italic">The Waste Land</hi> from a 'post-modern' perspective have placed it within the literary canon.<ref target="BAWE_3006c-ftnote.002"/> In order to 'make sense' of the text, Rodrigues and Garratt propose ways in which a reader should focus on the text as a piece of Modernist literature. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p3.15">Their suggestions are strongly related to the methods of textual analysis employed by Cultural Materialists; "to work on the material - the words, the shapes"; "to piece together the references, allusions and collage-like nature of the material"; and "to situate the works historically and critically so that their difficulty is translated into effective meaning and feeling." </s>

<s n="s1.6;p4.15">Through the application of Cultural Materialist ideas about contextual significance in textual analysis, it is possible to understand the text through the way in which it subverts hegemonic forms. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p4.15">Modernist artists were in part, reacting against the established and accepted lavish narrative techniques of the Romantic period. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p4.15">The most obvious evidence of this within the text is its form and structure. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p4.15">It is divided into sections, or books, much like some of the epic poems written by Romantic poets, for example Milton or Keats. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p4.15">However, despite passages of narrative, Eliot's verse becomes fragmented and more abstract. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p4.15">A clear example is the transition of the narrative passage at the beginning of 'A Game of Chess' into a more disjointed form: </s>
</p>
<quote lang="English">The Chair she sat in, like a burnished throne, Glowed on the marble, where the glass Held up by the standards wrought with fruited vines (Lines 77-9)</quote>
<p n="p5.15">
<s n="s1.7;p5.15">The passage is a clear introduction and can be credited with classic poetic techniques, for example the assonance between the words 'throne' and 'Glowed'. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p5.15">However, line 110 indicates a development of both language and style. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p5.15">The verse moves into a dialogic passage between what we might assume to be a male and female. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p5.15">One could suggest that this is linked to the literary modernist technique of "Rework[ing] slang and argotic expressions of everyday encounters into the texture of ... prose and verse." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3006c-ftnote.004"/>
<s n="s5.7;p5.15">The technique of collage was popular among Modernist artists across a wide range of genres. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p5.15">Eliot, together with other writers like Guillaume Apollinaire employed this technique as is evident in this shift in style. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p5.15">Thus, the text can be seen to be undermining previously accepted realist styles of writing and replacing them with a reflective collage of reality. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p6.15">Written in 1922, <hi rend="italic">The Waste Land</hi> not only subverts traditional classical forms, but also established ideals of society. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p6.15">In "The Burial of the Dead", Eliot manipulates and challenges hegemonic Romantic ideas about nature in order to evoke immediately the sterility of the modern experience. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p6.15">George Williamson comments on the "paradox of the seasons" which "inverts the attitude towards the life-cycle...giving an ironic turn" to the text. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p6.15">This is related to the modernist interrelation of memory and desire, which was largely due to the work of Freud and psychoanalysts alike. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p7.15">Cultural Materialism applies a Marxist critique and attempts to identify within a text, power relationships which reflect how society is a construction of contesting sites of power. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p7.15">Understanding the text on this level might suggest that it is one which concerns and questions identity and reality. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p7.15">The poem moves swiftly through a multitude of fictional characters. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p7.15">In particular the various female figures that are represented might reflect a societal ignorance towards identity and a sanctioning of man. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p7.15">Cultural Materialism employs various methods of textual analysis in order to 'make sense' of a text. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p7.15">Although he is perhaps not considered a cultural materialist, Mikhail Bakhtin's idea of how the novel is built upon varieties of social vocabularies also evokes the importance of the text's own historical culture. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p7.15">Through observing <hi rend="italic">The Waste Land</hi> on this level, it is possible to illustrate how Eliot presents this ignorance of identity and authority of man. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.15">
<s n="s1.11;p8.15">It is possible to divide 'A Game of Chess' into three sections, each of which focuses on a different female figure. </s>
<s n="s2.11;p8.15">All of these women, in a sense, are reflective of an artificial, infertile society. </s>
<s n="s3.11;p8.15">The first is presented through a narrative voice whose sensual language evokes a sexuality suggesting it is male. </s>
<s n="s4.11;p8.15">Indeed, this female figure has been interpreted as being a prostitute. </s>
<s n="s5.11;p8.15">This is also evident in the contrast drawn between the aristocratic and lavish surroundings, and 'her strange synthetic perfumes' (line 87), which suggests that she does not belong there. </s>
<s n="s6.11;p8.15">The perfume, itself, is used as a metaphor, suggesting that although this woman is outwardly secure, she is inwardly 'troubled, confused' (line 88); her appearance is false. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p8.15">The lines 111 - 139 introduce us to a woman whose own heteroglossia suggests she is hysterical. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p8.15">Her irrational threat to 'rush out as I am, and walk the street' (line131) is suggestive of her hysteria. </s>
<s n="s9.11;p8.15">She appears to represent a weaker sex and modern infertility and thus empowers the male sex. </s>
<s n="s10.11;p8.15">In the final section the dominant speaker can be read as a female publican whose heteroglossia is more fluent, but expressive only of gossip and thus remains artificial; there is no depth. </s>
<s n="s11.11;p8.15">The presentation of these women as being infertile and lacking true identity through the use of different voices and vocabularies seems to empower man over them. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.15">
<s n="s1.6;p9.15">Eliot uses language to perhaps challenge identity and break away from realist and symbolic art forms. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p9.15">Literary modernists were often concerned with the exploration of the "relationship of words to reality" and "attempt to set in crisis accepted ways of coding and understanding a changing world." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3006c-ftnote.006"/>
<s n="s3.6;p9.15">Cultural Materialism allows an interpretation of Eliot's "creative play with words"<ref target="BAWE_3006c-ftnote.007"/> as an exploitation of identity and empowerment through the absence of the Romantic notion of 'self', where the poet is omnipresent. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p9.15">There is no continuous narrator or identifiable voice, which seems to alienate the reader; we could question if we are ever spoken to directly. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p9.15">The way in which the speaker changes constantly, suggests that none of them are given power over us; through isolating the reader, the text refuses us any sense of power also. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p9.15">However, many of the figures portrayed are in some way victims of society, both pre-modern and modern; Cultural Materialism allows us to suggest that Eliot's cathartic work perhaps empowers these figures by articulating their inner anxieties rather than asserting a power over the reader. </s>

<s n="s5.8;p11.15">New technologies of the modern period allowed society to <hi rend="italic">see</hi> the effects of the First World War; the previous belief in the 'nobility' of war was called into question. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p11.15">Within such a context, the binary opposition of life and death is particularly prominent. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p11.15">In book three, 'The Fire Sermon', it is made significantly poignant through the use of war-like images. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p11.15">Furthermore, the amalgamation of senses in lines 185-6 embodies this opposition, illustrating 'life' through the human sense of touch: 'cold blast', but also implying 'death' through the way the speaker can 'hear / The rattle of the bones'. </s>

<s n="s1.8;p12.15">The First World War went further to effect behaviour and expectations, particularly in social, sexual and gender relations. </s>

<s n="s4.8;p12.15">One of the sexual dimensions represented could be described as a dry, baron interchange inseparable from neurosis and self-destruction. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p12.15">This is particularly clear in the scene described by Tiresias in lines 230 - 256 which illustrates "a seduction seemingly without any love or passion". </s>
<s n="s6.8;p12.15">The typist displays no desire to engage in sexual activity, "but no desire to resist seduction". </s>
