<s n="s3.7;p4.43">However pneumonia is not always the result of infection. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p4.43">In many cases, the result is Pontiac fever. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p4.43">This can have either no symptoms, or brief mild headaches and fever. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p4.43">Without treatment this is self-limiting and clears in two to five days, and is thought to account for many of the undiagnosed infections due to its high attack rate, but zero mortality rate. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p4.43">It is not known whether this is caused by bacterial toxin or the result of a strong immune response to the pathogen. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.43">
<s n="s1.2;p5.43">Industrial settings and larger populations of immunocompromised people have brought about increased numbers of infections. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p5.43">The disease is usually caused by altering the environment for human benefit, so work to improve the water sources containing <hi rend="italic">L. pneumophila</hi> could cause the occurrence of other opportunistic pathogens in human hosts. </s>

<s n="s3.5;p8.43">Places it can be found include heated reservoirs, cooling towers, evaporative condensers, large air conditioning systems, hot tanks, clinical respiratory devices, showers, mist machines in grocery stores and whirlpool spas. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p8.43">The water in each of these sources is nutrient poor for <hi rend="italic">L. pneumophila</hi> and induces the bacterium into stationary phase. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p8.43">The organisms are carried in contaminated water droplets, from which they are inhaled and consequently cause disease, however human-to-human transmission has not been observed. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.43">
<s n="s1.1;p9.43">Part of the support of transmission from water supplies to humans by aerosol droplets arises from the correlation of the peaks in disease in mid to late summer to the peaks in air conditioning use (7). </s>

<p n="p10.43">

<head rend="underlined">Attachment</head>
<p n="p14.43">
<s n="s1.3;p14.43">Attachment via a complement-mediated route has been proven feasible but is thought to be unlikely in macrophage, due to the low levels of complement in the human lung. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p14.43">Another possible method is the pili of <hi rend="italic">L. pneumophila</hi> acting as a ligand to bind to lectin on the protozoa (7) supported by an insertional mutation in the structural gene for pili (pilE <hi rend="sub">L</hi>), reducing adhesion in both amoebae and human monocytes by about half (12), and type IV pili being known to mediate host-cell attachment by the pathogenic <hi rend="italic">Neisseria</hi> species (13). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p14.43">It is therefore thought to be a legitimate candidate for the job in <hi rend="italic">L. pneumophila.</hi> </s>

<head rend="underlined">Entry</head>
<p n="p15.43">
<s n="s1.4;p15.43">The entry is thought to differ between hosts. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p15.43">Coiling phagocytosis (figure 2a) occurs in macrophage, when the plasma membrane engulfs the bacteria within coils of itself (1). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p15.43">The receptors involved are known to be CR1 and CR3 (complement receptors). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p15.43">Coiling phagocytosis has not been observed in amoebae and so entry here is thought to be independent of microfilaments, and possibly receptor mediated, although these receptors are unknown. </s>

</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="underlined">Phagosome establishment</head>
<p n="p16.43">
<s n="s1.4;p16.43">Once entered into the host cell (either 1 or 2 at a time (20)), <hi rend="italic">L pneumophila</hi> are inside a nascent (non-acidifying) phagosome with a single membrane. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p16.43">They export factors locally (demonstrated by other cellular phagosomes still fusing lysosomes) via the Dot/Icm secretion system, which cause modifications, most likely to the membrane of the phagosome, and prevent it from fusing with the endocytic pathway: vital for their survival (7). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p16.43">It has been seen that this replicative phagosome is missing the glycoprotein LAMP-1 on its membrane, which is seen on normal phagosomes as an endocytic pathway marker (5). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p16.43">The bacteria in these phagosomes are in stationary phase. </s>
</p>
<p n="p17.43">
<s n="s1.4;p17.43">This isolated phagosome then interacts with the mitochondria, and is engulfed by rough endoplasmic reticulum, becoming an autophagosomal vacuole. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p17.43">Inside this protected phagosome it converts to its replicative form, where it is acid tolerant and does not require the assistance of Icm/Dot. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p17.43">Furthermore numerous virulence traits are not expressed, the key trait being the ability being able to block membrane fusion. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p17.43">This allows the phagosome to bind with the lysosomal compartment proving a harsh but nutrient rich replication niche. </s>

<head rend="underlined">Depletion of amino acids, and lysis of macrophage</head>
<p n="p18.43">
<s n="s1.6;p18.43">When replication is complete, and amino acids are depleted, the progeny of <hi rend="italic">L. pneumophila</hi> collect in the secondary messenger guanosine 3', 5' - bispyrophosphate (ppGpp). </s>
<s n="s2.6;p18.43">This induces the expression of virulence factors causing its new virulent phenotype, promoting transmission of <hi rend="italic">L. pneumophila</hi> to a new phagocyte. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p18.43">This has been seen by cells in their post-exponential state converting to the virulent phenotype only when incubated in post-exponential phase culture supernatant lacking amino acids. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p18.43">Important traits include osmotic resistance, which increases survival in the extracellular environment, motility, which helps dispersal and contact with a new host cell, a cytotoxin, which promotes escape from the current host, and the ability to evade phagosome-lysosome gives it a better chance for survival in the next phagosome, where the cycle repeats (7). </s>
<s n="s5.6;p18.43">
<hi rend="italic">L. pneumophila</hi> have been observed in the host cell swimming away from ruptured hosts, however approximately 24 hours later, no motility is detected (3). </s>
<s n="s6.6;p18.43">This demonstrates the induction of the virulence factors just for the short period when it is necessary to enable it to find a new host. </s>
</p>
<p n="p19.43">
<s n="s1.10;p19.43">The promotion of escape from the current host occurs by the development of pores in the host membrane. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p19.43">This can be seen in macrophages in the form of tissue damage, however it has not been observed in amoebae, where the pores are thought to exist in the membrane of the single celled organism (7). </s>
<s n="s3.10;p19.43">Through these pores effector molecules are sent to help evade phagosome-lysosome fusion. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p19.43">For up to a limited number of pores eukaryotic cells can survive (possibly by blocking them (5)), but any more and lysis occurs. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p19.43">Pore formation requires the presence of the Dot/Icm complex, which mediates the activation of caspase 3 (8). </s>
<s n="s6.10;p19.43">Caspase 3 induces nuclear apoptosis by cleavage of a specific substrate (7). </s>
<s n="s7.10;p19.43">Another Dot region is also involved, with a very similar function but located in a separate but unknown loci (6). </s>
<s n="s8.10;p19.43">The genes in this region are called dotH, dotI and dotO (5). </s>
<s n="s9.10;p19.43">Apoptosis allows <hi rend="italic">L. pneumophila</hi> to rapidly infect an increasing number of cells, in each using up the nutrient supply, and causing them to die. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p19.43">It is therefore extremely important to the cytopathogenicity in the early stages of infection (8). </s>

<head rend="underlined">Contribution of amoebae to disease</head>
<p n="p39.43">
<s n="s1.8;p39.43">It is thanks to their natural host, amoebae, that <hi rend="italic">L. pneumophila</hi> are able to evade the immune system of human macrophages. </s>

<s n="s4.8;p39.43">These factors are then transferred to human macrophage, and allow infection. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p39.43">Experimental evidence from Gao et al (4) compared the growth kinetics in 89 mutants with similar phenotypic defects in virulence traits and found very similar patterns arise for both hosts. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p39.43">This shows that similar mechanisms are involved in replication in the protozoan and human hosts. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p39.43">Growth in amoebae prior to human infection is shown to enhance entry into macrophage by 100 to 1000 fold (11). </s>
<s n="s8.8;p39.43">Growth in amoebae also makes the bacteria more resistant to antimicrobial agents, and alters fatty acids and surface proteins, although it is not known if these affect the virulence (3). </s>

<s n="s4.4;p40.43">(As observed in a guinea pig model of infection by measuring 50% lethal dose (TD <hi rend="sub">50</hi>) (16)) It is thought that the higher virulence at higher temperatures is the result of environmental stress that <hi rend="italic">L. pneumophila</hi> may sporadically encounter in their natural host. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p41.43">In view of the evidential studies it can be said that <hi rend="italic">L. pneumophila</hi> is a problem organism in a number of ways. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p41.43">It is a problem organism due to its ability to replicate in the human macrophage, despite this not serving as its natural host. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p41.43">It is convenient for the organism that the pathway used, and virulence factors expressed in amoebae, work incredibly well upon infection in alveolar monocytes. </s>
</p>
<p n="p42.43">
<s n="s1.5;p42.43">
<hi rend="italic">L. pneumophila</hi> are able to exploit mechanisms of their host to evade the immune system in multiple ways. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p42.43">Firstly <hi rend="italic">L. pneumophila</hi> is capable of avoiding fusion with lysosomes that usually follows phagocytosis. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p42.43">This allows the phagosome to express the ideal conditions for converting to its replicative form. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p42.43">Upon completion of conversion, loss of virulence traits blocking membrane fusion and lysosome fusion occurrence enables it to take advantage of a second niche for replication. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p42.43">Expression of an autophagy-like process facilitates host cells lyses by the high production of pores, and <hi rend="italic">L. pneumophila</hi> has once again taken advantage of that host. </s>
</p>
<p n="p43.43">
<s n="s1.1;p43.43">The surveillance of the intracellular environment to react to pH, iron and amino acid levels etc, enable <hi rend="italic">L. pneumophila</hi> to express virulent traits such as motility and gene expression at the appropriate times to take full advantage of the host, including transmission between hosts on exhaustion of the nutrient supply. </s>
