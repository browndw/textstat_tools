<s n="s2.4;p1.35">In this context, distribution, or channel strategy, relates to tourism and hospitality as a critical factor of competitiveness (Buhalis, 2001a; Lynch, 2003). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p1.35">The aim of this assignment is thus put into view; how can companies monopolize on ICT and <hi rend="italic">Electronic Distribution</hi> to gain competitive advantages. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p1.35">The assignment presents an international travel package, examined through 3 distribution channels subsequently discussed, evaluated to relevant theories from a consumer and business perspective to determine the comparative effectiveness of each channel. </s>

</p>
<p n="p3.35">
<s n="s1.9;p3.35">Travel plans require the gathering of numerous sources of information on particular destinations; thus the intangibility, and distance, of such products is a considerable emotional investment, irreplaceable if anything goes wrong (Buhalis <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s2.9;p3.35">, 2001b, O'Connor, 1999; La <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>, 2002). </s>
<s n="s3.9;p3.35">Tourism <hi rend="italic">distribution</hi> hence consists in providing sufficient information, combination, and travel plan services via suitable and accessible <hi rend="italic">points-of-sale</hi> (Buhalis, 2001a; Middleton <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 2001). </s>
<s n="s4.9;p3.35">Globalisation, the theory of converging markets in response to modernity, intensifies information demand; and so, <hi rend="italic">distribution channels</hi> are effective tools to ease decision-making, and reduce perceived risks (Buhalis, 2001a; Levitt, 1983). </s>
<s n="s5.9;p3.35">Until the early 90's <hi rend="italic">electronic</hi> distribution channels were described as 'a cosy status quo between the <hi rend="italic">CRSs</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">GDSs</hi>'; used by the airline industry and later adopted by tourism and hospitality (Buhails <hi rend="italic"> et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s6.9;p3.35">, 2001b; O'Connor, 2004, p.185). </s>
<s n="s7.9;p3.35">Despite an evolutionary link between the two, CRSs leading to GDSs, connecting growing numbers of these systems often proved costly and technical; often requiring a <hi rend="italic">Switch</hi> to translate transactions into a compatible, computer language (O'Conner, 2004). </s>
<s n="s8.9;p3.35">Despite lucrative mass bookings, these distribution channels proved expensive and inflexible; particularly in marketing more dynamic, and complex, hotel products versus simpler, stable, airline seats (Buhalis <hi rend="italic"> et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s9.9;p3.35">, 2001b; O'Connor, 2004). </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.35">
<s n="s1.4;p4.35">While such channels still exist, suppliers seek faster, economical, more direct means to distribute information to evermore demanding tourists (Buhalis <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s2.4;p4.35">, 2001b). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p4.35">As a result tourism and <hi rend="italic">ICT</hi> developments, are closely interrelated and unclear as to which industry depends on the other (Buhalis, 2003; Law <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 2004; Middleton <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 2001). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p4.35">Even so, global <hi rend="italic">reach</hi>, information access speed and <hi rend="italic">richness</hi>, rely on continued ICT progress; that is, a demand for precise and quickly flowing information throughout the tourism industry needs ICT progress to ease these functions (Buhalis, 2003; O'Connor, 1999). </s>

</p>
<p n="p6.35">
<s n="s1.13;p6.35">Initially created to aid research groups, the <hi rend="italic">internet</hi> has grown considerably as a global marketing platform; where firms and consumers rapidly and effectively exchange information, products, and services (La <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s2.13;p6.35">, 2002; May, 2000; O'Connor, 1999). </s>
<s n="s3.13;p6.35">Thus, the travel and tourism industry with its propensity to seek information on services and products, tied with increased tourism demand; has placed the Internet as one of the industry's most used communication and distribution channels (Middleton <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s4.13;p6.35">, 2001; Law <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s5.13;p6.35">, 2004; Wynne <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 2001). </s>
<s n="s6.13;p6.35">The <hi rend="italic">Web</hi> allows suppliers to directly target the desired consumers at any time and location with an internet connection; achievable by lower distribution costs with desirable speed and flexibility (Middleton <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s7.13;p6.35">, 2001; Law <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s8.13;p6.35">, 2004). </s>
<s n="s9.13;p6.35">Conversely, some suppliers benefit from outsourcing services to third-party retailers; who may in turn increase global reach and awareness by indirect marketing (La <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 2002). </s>
<s n="s10.13;p6.35">While core consumer needs remain unaffected, the Web has reformed the exchange of information through accessible <hi rend="italic">websites</hi>; empowering travellers to arrange, evaluate, and perform their own transactions at any given time from, almost, any location with suitable web connections (Middleton <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s11.13;p6.35">2001; O'Connor, 1999; La <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 2002; Law <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>

<div2>
<head rend="underlined">Issues of the Web:</head>
<p n="p7.35">
<s n="s1.10;p7.35">While considerable information is available, finding relevant and credible subject material can be complicated by the relatively unstructured nature of the web (O'Conner, 2004). </s>
<s n="s2.10;p7.35">The additional, unbridled, user presence and demand tied with more information-rich <hi rend="italic">websites</hi> now sees more detailed graphics, videos, and sound that take up considerable loading time (O'Conner, 2004). </s>
<s n="s3.10;p7.35">A more serious issue for both consumers and firms is exposure to increasingly open societies and potential dangers of <hi rend="italic">cyber-crime</hi> (Chou <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 1999; Smith, 2004). </s>
<s n="s4.10;p7.35">Excluding the many <hi rend="italic">viruses</hi> that can infect computers, personal data and credit card numbers may be fraudulently misused; gained through deceit or by <hi rend="italic">cracking</hi> (Chaffey, 2002; May, 2000; O'Conner, 2004). </s>
<s n="s5.10;p7.35">Combating such acts includes offering secure dealings with <hi rend="italic">encryption</hi> and security <hi rend="italic">software</hi>, such as <hi rend="italic">SSL</hi> and <hi rend="italic">SET</hi> (Chaffey, 2002; O'Connor, 2004). </s>
<s n="s6.10;p7.35">Even so, such crimes harm individuals financially, but more so by creating distrust in an already fragile relationship; the theory being the lack of social presence in online transactions hinders the development of loyalty, which suffers further by such crimes (Gefen <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s7.10;p7.35">2003; May, 2000; Reichweld <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s8.10;p7.35">, 2000). </s>
<s n="s9.10;p7.35">A recent issue is a growing concern to meet Web <hi rend="italic">Accessibility</hi> guidelines and make web content accessible to disabled people (WAI, 1999). </s>
<s n="s10.10;p7.35">Overall, the web promotes business encounters and global trade of information, yet payment and relationship building remain problematic; delaying <hi rend="italic">e-commerce</hi> practice by firms and acceptance by consumers (May, 2000). </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="underlined">Privacy &amp; Branding:</head>
<p n="p8.35">
<s n="s1.12;p8.35">Firms may attempt to personalize online visits and build relationships of trust by recognizing users between encounters; known as <hi rend="italic">eCRM</hi> (Jelassi, 2005; May, 2000). </s>
<s n="s2.12;p8.35">This may require firms to track purchase patterns, and build geo-demographic databases by way of <hi rend="italic">cookies</hi> and online registration forms (Jelassi, 2005; May, 2000). </s>
<s n="s3.12;p8.35">Yet users may oppose such tactics on the basis of invasion of privacy, or the latter case, lack of time or devotion to fill out forms or disclose information (Chaffey <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s4.12;p8.35">, 2003; May, 2000). </s>
<s n="s5.12;p8.35">Moreover, while firms many use this data to <hi rend="italic">e-mail</hi> consumers with similar product and service information, the connotation of this method relates to unsolicited mail or <hi rend="italic">SPAM</hi> (Chaffey <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s6.12;p8.35">, 2003). </s>
<s n="s7.12;p8.35">While e-commerce can use traditional trust building relationships their success is arguable; the theory being the lack of face-to-face contact cannot be replaced by computers (Papadopoulou <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>, 2001). </s>
<s n="s8.12;p8.35">Efficient <hi rend="italic">e-branding</hi> thus emphasizes a more social online presence with virtual societies, user comments, and other receptive tools to ease interaction and build trust (Gefen <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s9.12;p8.35">, 2003; McCole, 2002). </s>
<s n="s10.12;p8.35">Yet risk to <hi rend="italic">brand equity</hi> through minimal awareness and poor web-design can demote perceived quality and brand association; ultimately deterring brand loyalty (Aaker <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s11.12;p8.35">, 2000 cited in Chaffey <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 2003). </s>
<s n="s12.12;p8.35">Firms thus need to carefully consider moving online, either by modified <hi rend="italic">brand</hi> <hi rend="italic">identity</hi> or other means including <hi rend="italic">partnerships</hi>, <hi rend="italic">extended</hi> <hi rend="italic">brands</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">new-digital brands</hi> (Chaffey <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 2003). </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="underlined">E-Distribution Players:</head>
<p n="p9.35">
<s n="s1.14;p9.35">As stated, internet provides firms direct global and economic control of distribution, together with involving consumers in incorporating their <hi rend="italic">values</hi> into a transaction (Paraskevas, 2005; Tapscott <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 2000). </s>
<s n="s2.14;p9.35">In so doing internet alters distribution structures, creating new <hi rend="italic">intermediaries</hi> and channels or evading these altogether; <hi rend="italic">reintermediation</hi> or <hi rend="italic">disintermediation</hi> (Chaffey, 2002; O'Connor, 1999; Law <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s3.14;p9.35">, 2004; Wynne <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s4.14;p9.35">, 2001). </s>
<s n="s5.14;p9.35">The benefits of the latter include reduced costs in selling services through middlemen, allowing firms to regain control over price and inventory (Chaffey, 2002). </s>
<s n="s6.14;p9.35">Such benefits can be passed <hi rend="italic">directly</hi> to consumers by price reductions and aid in raising potential loyalty (Chaffey, 2002). </s>
<s n="s7.14;p9.35">While firms can capitalize on this tactic, and impact intermediary practices, profit is in some cases less apparent; and so the role of travel retailers is far from erasable (Chaffey, 2002; O'Connor, 1999; Law <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s8.14;p9.35">, 2004; Wynne <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s9.14;p9.35">, 2001). </s>
<s n="s10.14;p9.35">Indeed some consumers require support in selecting services and products thus creating, or reintroducing, web-intermediaries with new value-added web services (Chaffey, 2002; O'Connor, 1999; La <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>, 2002; May, 2000). </s>
<s n="s11.14;p9.35">This has produced many web-based firms specialised in selling airline seats and hotel rooms; offering choice, convenience, and value to consumers and increasing distribution for travel firms (La <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>, 2002). </s>
<s n="s12.14;p9.35">As per Tapscott <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>. </s>
<s n="s13.14;p9.35">(2000) shifting distribution trends, tied with the parameters of control and value, define five key players; subsequently adapted to the travel and tourism industry by Paraskevas (2005). </s>
<s n="s14.14;p9.35">(Consult Appendix 3). </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.35">
<s n="s1.2;p10.35">
<hi rend="italic"> Principals</hi> include any tourism firm with products to sell such as airlines, hotels, and attractions; for the purpose of converting travel into desirable prices for consumers (Middleton <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>, 2001; Paraskevas, 2005). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p10.35">Solely focused on <hi rend="italic">individual</hi> capabilities and market intelligence, these players jointly discover desired prices with consumers, who further benefit with integrated value (Paraskevas, 2005; Tapscott <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 2000). </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.35">
<s n="s1.2;p11.35">
<hi rend="italic"> Aggregators</hi> select, price, organize and convenience delivery (part or all the way) of services offered by various Principals into optimal travel <hi rend="italic">packages</hi>; targeted to meet the needs of the <hi rend="italic">average</hi> consumers within specific market segments (Paraskevas, 2005; Tapscott <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 2000). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p11.35">Despite the variety offered by packages, consumer involvement and value integration, is relatively low (Paraskevas, 2005; Tapscott <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 2000). </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.35">
<s n="s1.1;p12.35">Conversely, <hi rend="italic">Integrators</hi> structure and direct a network of Principals to design and deliver packages that meet specific, <hi rend="italic">individual</hi>, consumer needs; with the purpose of involving consumers as value drivers, who are charged according to the levels and amount of service required (Paraskevas, 2005; Tapscott <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 2000). </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.35">
<s n="s1.2;p13.35">
<hi rend="italic">Alliances</hi> are collaborative groups of participants seeking to creatively contribute towards a shared goal; these are often governed by rules and standards relating to matters of interaction, behaviour, and determination of value and prices (Paraskevas, 2005; Tapscott <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 2000). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p13.35">Yet while consumers of <hi rend="italic">products</hi> can be involved in value integration by way of contributory participation, this is not viable in services owing to the <hi rend="italic">inseparable</hi> nature of the experience where consumers purchase and use the final experience; they are <hi rend="italic">buyers</hi>, not <hi rend="italic">contributors</hi> (Paraskevas, 2005; Tapscott <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 2000). </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.35">
<s n="s1.2;p14.35">
<hi rend="italic">Infomediaries</hi> are the proverbial mediators which facilitate the distributive exchange and delivery of information, goods, and services; thus servicing both the providers and consumers of service (Paraskevas, 2005; Tapscott <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 2000). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p14.35">Such networks are high and low relative to control and involvement; while they offer valuable information, this remains unforeseeable and uncontrollable (Paraskevas, 2005; Tapscott <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 2000). </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="underlined">Price &amp; Brand Implications:</head>
<p n="p15.35">
<s n="s1.8;p15.35">The Internet has radically altered distribution by way of reach, direct or indirect, and rich information available; yet this implicates pricing and branding strategies (Bowie <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s2.8;p15.35">, 2005; Porter, 2001). </s>
<s n="s3.8;p15.35">The Web's borderless nature has widened geographic competition and complicated differentiation among firms; and so competition shifts toward price (Porter, 2001). </s>
<s n="s4.8;p15.35">Thus the affects of <hi rend="italic">Price Transparency</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Brand Dilution</hi> greatly impact Principals using diverse Web channels in reaching consumers (Bowie <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s5.8;p15.35">, 2005). </s>
<s n="s6.8;p15.35">As the <hi rend="italic">Merchant Model</hi> shows (Consult Appendix 4), Principals efficiently market via the Web directly to consumers with minimal brand dilution; yet extending brand reach via other web-players reduces the control of price and consumer brand awareness (Bowie <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s7.8;p15.35">, 2005). </s>
<s n="s8.8;p15.35">In brief, more distant and shifting brand extensions, bear more brand dilution; tied with increased consumer bargaining power via comparative pricing, and reduced cost control by channel conflict (Bowie <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 2005; Porter, 2001). </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.35">
<s n="s1.2;p16.35">With the purpose to investigate the topic areas discussed thus far, the assignment dismantles a travel package offered by an <hi rend="italic">Aggregator</hi> and evaluates similarities and differences as per the <hi rend="italic">Principals</hi> involved, and a chosen <hi rend="italic">Integrator</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p16.35">While a level of subjectivity <hi rend="italic">will</hi> be involved in this evaluation, the aim will be to keep this to a minimum. </s>

<s n="s8.8;p29.35">As the theory suggests, this is increasingly vital to encourage online purchases by way of not only informative, but additionally secure and privacy sensitive transactions. </s>
</p>
<p n="p30.35">
<s n="s1.4;p30.35">As the evaluations have illustrated, various firms have taken to the web as a means to increase global reach, yet they leave room for improvement. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p30.35">Beginning with the aggregator for example, while the site offers access to rich content by way of eased navigation, the lacking search capability may hinder users' further access to onsite and external information. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p30.35">It would thus be recommendable the site consider providing at least a basic form of search engine; in so doing, the company could better <hi rend="italic">interact</hi> with its users by way of providing search access for the excluded flight element of the package, and further justify the use of cookies by the site. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p30.35">On this assumption users may become more inclined to book the package, knowing they may concurrently search the web for potential flights to Cape Town, which will be stored for future access. </s>
</p>
<p n="p31.35">
<s n="s1.4;p31.35">Ultimately, this site is recommended to incorporate at least basic security measures into the booking form; and while it can be argued that an online bookings are dissimilar to true online transactions, they stills involve users submitting personal information online. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p31.35">By providing added security measures, as per the theory, the company could thus increase trust levels between the user and supplier. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p31.35">Additional changes to improve the value adding features on the website could include the adoption of a virtual tour, such as the one in SharkCageDiving.net. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p31.35">This would further benefit the company in meeting the increased demand for more <hi rend="italic">graphic</hi> information; the proverbial a picture is worth a thousand words (O'Connor, 2004). </s>
</p>
<p n="p32.35">
<s n="s1.4;p32.35">Indeed one of the more exemplary sites of this assignment, South African Airlines further supports this view. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p32.35">The site is a good example of the proper use of both security measures, and justified privacy intrusion, to develop higher levels of trust with users to encourage online transactions and return visits. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p32.35">Yet despite its efforts to present site content in an organized lay out, the lack of graphics may result in the site appearing less aesthetically pleasing to graphically demanding users. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p32.35">A recommendation would thus be to include a 'welcome' animation of relevant images, such as crew members tending to passengers, in an effort for the website to simulate the <hi rend="italic">human touch</hi> and professional <hi rend="italic">service</hi> available to consumers. </s>
</p>
<p n="p33.35">
<s n="s1.9;p33.35">Research suggests developments of electronic distribution have also resulted in disintermediation to a considerable scale, particularly within the South African tourism industry (Wynne <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s2.9;p33.35">, 2001). </s>
<s n="s3.9;p33.35">Thus, being a relatively new online integrator, presents cybercapetown the opportunity to better <hi rend="italic">reach</hi> a global market through its site; yet <hi rend="italic">substantial</hi> room for improvement remains. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p33.35">As discussed, to effectively meet the demand for rapid flowing information throughout the tourism industry, requires progress in ICT maintenance (Buhalis, 2003). </s>
<s n="s5.9;p33.35">An immediate recommendation would thus be upgrading maintenance programs and efforts to ensure the smooth operation of the site's navigation and search bar; unhelpfully affected by errors. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p33.35">This could benefit the company in aiding users to access the extensive amount of information the site offers, and potentially engage in already secure transactions, thus spreading positive word of mouth. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p33.35">Reducing excess scrolling with anchors, in addition to restructuring the layout of the site, would further strengthen the readability and organized appearance of the website. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p33.35">Moreover, it is recommended the site make more use of personalization such as a 'shopping cart' option similar to the one offered by Amazon.com. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p33.35">This could justify the sites invasion of privacy through cookies while further providing users with the incentive to use a site which promises to <hi rend="italic">remember</hi> the user upon return. </s>
</p>
<p n="p34.35">
<s n="s1.14;p34.35">The Principals in this assignment, as the analysis suggests, have demonstrated that while the internet <hi rend="italic">has</hi> provided increased levels of direct marketing for such channels, to an extent more <hi rend="italic">niche</hi> and <hi rend="italic">boutique</hi> companies have yet to fully employ the usage of electronic distribution. </s>
<s n="s2.14;p34.35">Indeed the Website Evaluation (Appendix 7) indicates these sites are relatively difficult to access via their often complex URL, supporting the theory that they may benefit from outsourcing their site design services to online intermediaries or infomeadiaries (La <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s3.14;p34.35">, 2001). </s>
<s n="s4.14;p34.35">A recommendation of this nature however, has to be carefully considered, owing to the increased risk of brand dilution; assumed to be an already delicate element to this market. </s>
<s n="s5.14;p34.35">To this extent a more plausible recommendation would be to outsource to a <hi rend="italic">specialized</hi> integrator, thus benefiting the companies through increased reach while providing those lesser effective sites the opportunity to possibly benefit from outside market intelligence. </s>
<s n="s6.14;p34.35">Such is the case with the Auberge Burgundy, among the weakest of sites, which under this assumption could benefit from outsourcing its site to an internet savvy integrator to effectively improve on the company site. </s>
<s n="s7.14;p34.35">Similar <hi rend="italic">reintermediation</hi> would benefit the shark cage diving Principals, which as suggested by the analysis lack the opportunities to be accessed through integrators. </s>
<s n="s8.14;p34.35">Under this assumption, the Principals could thus benefit from increased visits via higher levels of access to the company sites by desired target markets. </s>
<s n="s9.14;p34.35">As with all the latter mentioned Principals a final recommendation, would be to provide basic levels of security and privacy measures. </s>
<s n="s10.14;p34.35">Even with the continued use of bookings such measures could entice users to consider the Principals further when making decisions, and gathering travel information. </s>
<s n="s11.14;p34.35">Additional personalization of site experiences to selected target markets could allow such niche companies to develop stronger levels trust and loyalty. </s>
<s n="s12.14;p34.35">The final issue of accessibility is an area which has affected all websites; indeed the web as a whole. </s>
<s n="s13.14;p34.35">While it may be argued that this particular package requires a certain level of fitness, the use of the internet in accessing information is not limited to able bodied individuals. </s>
<s n="s14.14;p34.35">Thus a final a recommendation is for the selected channels to pursue future goals in meeting the necessary guidelines to enrich the knowledge of all individuals. </s>
</p>
<p n="p35.35">
<s n="s1.5;p35.35">Ultimately the implications of the assignment present a considerable modification of the original travel package, and to some extent, may have skewed the overall findings and discussion. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p35.35">While in some cases modifications were inevitable, owing to technical errors of the web, some were more related to the incapability of certain channels to meet more <hi rend="italic">specialized</hi> demands; a possible area for improvement for both Principals and Intermediaries. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p35.35">Nonetheless, the assignment demonstrates how the dynamic nature of the tourism industry, tied with distributive capacity of ICT phenomena such as the internet, have established new parameters of modern marketing and pricing strategy (Middleton <hi rend="italic"> et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s4.5;p35.35">, 2001). </s>
<s n="s5.5;p35.35">Ultimately, developments in distribution channels provide the travel and tourism industry the means with which to better integrate the value of desired consumers; providing firms the opportunity to better design effective online services, transactions, and security measures to enhance the levels of required trust in exchanging valuable information over the increasingly important world wide web. </s>
