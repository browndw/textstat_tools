<s n="s2.4;p2.44">These three sides of the same theme have led to multiple interpretations and readings in the light of postmodernism, trauma studies or advocacy criticism. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p2.44">In 'The Novels of Graham Swift', Tamás Bényei states that literary criticism of Swift's novels either tends to study what Linda Hutcheon names "historiographic metafiction" and predominantly looks at <hi rend="italic">Waterland</hi>, or, review of all of his novels, focusing on mourning and melancholia<ref target="BAWE_3160d-ftnote.002"/>. </s>
