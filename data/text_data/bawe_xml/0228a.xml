</p>
<p n="p47.98">
<s n="s1.2;p47.98">
<hi rend="underlined">The user will have to wait for the feedback before scanning a new item</hi> - If the user scans too many barcodes before the previous ones are returned the system would slow down, increasing usage time which would be unacceptable. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p47.98">A possible solution to this would be to increase memory and store barcodes in a temporary memory area but this would increase costs. </s>
