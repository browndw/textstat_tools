<s n="s3.15;p4.12">To be a disease it needed a specific organic malfunction, however, hysteria lacked these characteristics to make it a scientific disease. </s>
<s n="s4.15;p4.12">This is partly because both neurasthenia and hysteria were subjective in their diagnosis. </s>
<s n="s5.15;p4.12">A patient could have a desire to be labelled sick. </s>
