</p>
</note>
<p n="p2.30">
<s n="s1.3;p2.30">Until recently, the question of reparations has not been considered as a global one. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p2.30">Our task will be to question the possibilities of creating a global regime of reparations for slavery; the main obstacle in the establishment of a global regime of reparations is being the identification of the claimants as individuals or as a group, of the entity (government, state, corporation) or the people (individuals living in a society) who to be given reparations. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p2.30">This issue is not only about allocating financial reparations from one group to another; it also reveals the conception of justice we have today, the role of human rights in the shaping of a new idea of justice, the relation between law and justice and the importance of justice as the foundation of a sustainable development. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.30">
<s n="s1.7;p3.30">How to build a global regime of reparations when the disparities in the treatment of different cases seem to be irreconcilable? </s>
<s n="s2.7;p3.30">For instance, Native American and Inuit claims of land ownership were accepted and legitimated while the interned Japanese Canadian during WWII received compensation; so did Israel from Germany for the suffering endured by the Jews under the Nazi regime. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p3.30">But the question of reparations not only for the African Americans but the Africans from the continent, who still suffer today from the injustice of slavery, slave trade and the racist aspect of colonization, is highly disputed. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p3.30">In France, the question of reparations is of another type. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p3.30">The French society faces conflicting memories, individual and collective, in relation to the colonial past and its present effects. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p3.30">The aim of the memorial laws which I will describe in the next sections is to acknowledge the injustice done in the name of colonization by the state. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p3.30">The recognition of slavery as a crime against humanity has only been used as a legal instrument to compel the French government to give compensation by the M.I.R (International Movement for Reparations), a movement based in Martinique. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.30">
<s n="s1.1;p4.30">The reparations can be asked because of the official violation of rights undertaken by governments as a systematic policy in the past. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.30">
<s n="s1.5;p5.30">At a global scale, the recognition of slavery and slave trade as a crime against humanity - which has no prescription - can ground a legal claim for reparations provided to the descendants of victims of severe violations of their basic human rights during the slave trade and colonization. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p5.30">The moral argument which has been debated by many scholars and justice theorists seems to be undisputable. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p5.30">Every moral agent today is aware that colonization and slavery were unjust and wrong. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p5.30">The political argument is present but questionable. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p5.30">Are the apologies or 'regrets' offered by the French President and the British Prime Minister sincere or fashionable? </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.30">
<s n="s1.3;p6.30">The question remains: What kind of reparations is due and to whom? </s>
<s n="s2.3;p6.30">Is a theory of reparations for ancient wrongs applicable in reality? </s>
<s n="s3.3;p6.30">If it is material, then this material gain for descendants of slaves who suffer from racial discrimination should not turn out to be a new type of injustice for other groups. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.30">
<s n="s1.1;p7.30">This essay tries to encapsulate (I) the philosophical grounds of a fair and sustainable regime of reparations for descendants of victims of slavery and racist aspects of colonization and (II) the practicality and feasibility of a legal regime of reparations. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p8.30">The first argument is a very obvious and twofold one. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p8.30">On the one hand, the crime of slavery and trade, if committed today, would be punished by law and their perpetrators would be liable for them and prosecuted. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p8.30">Indeed, the first articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights state the unalienable rights which are freedom and equality (article 1), non-discrimination (article 2), the right to life (article 3), the prohibition of slavery (article 4), and the right to an equal protection of the law (article 7). </s>
<s n="s4.6;p8.30">The international criminal law, from the Nuremburg to the Iraq trials, seeks to punish the people responsible for crimes against humanity. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p8.30">On the other hand, the victims of these crimes would receive compensation and reparations. </s>

<p n="p9.30">
<s n="s1.11;p9.30">Moreover, the right of someone who suffered abuses to claim reparations is not extinguished with his or her death and can be pursued by his or her heirs. </s>
<s n="s2.11;p9.30">But the longer the period between the wrong and the claim for reparation, the more contested this claim will be because of the nature of history and time. </s>
<s n="s3.11;p9.30">Other causal facts can enter into consideration when the present effects of a past wrong are being envisaged. </s>
<s n="s4.11;p9.30">In her paper 'Historical injustice and reparations: Justifying claims of descendants', Janna Thompson ponders on this issue and gives an answer. </s>
<s n="s5.11;p9.30">To make claims for reparations for descendants of slaves, it is necessary to link the present harm suffered by the descendants and the harm done to the ancestors in a causal relation which should be automatic and within the scope of the first injustice. </s>
<s n="s6.11;p9.30">It seems difficult to meet these two conditions over a period of 200 years. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p9.30">Nevertheless, Thompson argues that the suffering of the descendants of persecuted families is directly and automatically connected to the injustice done to them in the past because the identity of an individual is forged on the remembrance of the history and past of the family he or she belongs to. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p9.30">The anger, pain and sadness are an automatic effect of the awareness of the injustice. </s>
<s n="s9.11;p9.30">The time and place where the injustice occurred does not matter but its meaning for the present generation has to be considered as a direct consequence of it and of the fact that no apology and no recognition has been expressed to them<ref target="BAWE_0409d-ftnote.003"/>. </s>
<s n="s10.11;p9.30">Mari Matsuda, a leading thinker of the Critical Legal Studies movement and the Critical Race Theory, argues that the race consciousness of African-American today is the consequence of systematic injuries and exploitations that their ancestors suffered as slaves. </s>
<s n="s11.11;p9.30">This consciousness justifies the reparations and makes the refusal to pay or to acknowledge them a perpetuation of the injuries. </s>
