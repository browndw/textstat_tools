<s n="s3.11;p47.48">The magnetic field is applied externally and thus it's strength is known - however, the frequency of radiation required to bring about resonance is different to what would be expected, which implies the electron experiences additional magnetic influences. </s>
<s n="s4.11;p47.48">These other magnetic effects are caused by the local magnetic environment in which the electron is found, ie., through spin-orbit coupling. </s>
<s n="s5.11;p47.48">When an electron is placed in a magnetic field it's degeneracy is split dependant upon the B-fields magnitude. </s>
<s n="s6.11;p47.48">The energy separation between levels is proportional to the effective magnetic field strength and the gyromagnetic factor. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p47.48">The gyromagnetic factor is characteristic of the complex under measurement. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p47.48">For a free electron, the g-factor is 2.0023 (g <hi rend="sub">e</hi>), and when the observed g-factor is greater than g <hi rend="sub">e</hi>, the local field is larger than that applied externally. </s>
<s n="s9.11;p47.48">The magnetic field set for which the data was collected requires radiation with frequency of 9.22GHz. </s>
<s n="s10.11;p47.48">This is in the X-Band range, and has a wavelength of ca. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p48.48">Nuclei that possess non-zero spin contribute additional magnetic components to the field. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p48.48">This gives rise to a hyperfine, 2I+1 splitting pattern. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p48.48">The magnitude of the hyperfine splitting constant tells us how probable it is that the paramagnetic electron is found close to a magnetic nucleus. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p48.48">This is has a very important implication - if the ligands possess magnetic nuclei, then the constant tells us to what extent the metal's paramagnetic electron is delocalised onto the ligands. </s>
