<s n="s7.7;p2.29">Furthermore, Giandomenico Majone's seminal work concerning EU regulatory policy will serve as an exemplar of theorising EU governance and provide food for thought on how theories attempting to explain the EU may develop within the multi-level governance perspective.<ref target="BAWE_0255c-ftnote.001"/> In this essay, the term 'multi-level governance' is regarded as the general conceptual framework for which other scholars simply refer to as "governance", "new governance" or 'the governance agenda'. <ref target="BAWE_0255c-ftnote.002"/> </s>

<s n="s3.6;p4.29">The turn towards conceptualising governance in the EU, as a 'policy oriented perspective', occurred as a vacuum emerged in European studies when International Relations theorists became disinterested in the EU meta-narrative because it did not appear to offer new, dynamic implications for the international system. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p4.29">The new generation of theorists became interested in 'single policies or policy fields', 'public opinion studies', and the specific analysis of the EU polity. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p4.29">Research agenda that are usually confined to the domestic political arena became the focus of scholars seeking to understand the complexities of the EU. This process was invigorated in the 1990s with the renewed impetus for integration after the passing of the Single European Act. </s>

<p n="p8.29">
<s n="s1.6;p8.29">The potential of the multi-level governance approach lies in the possibility to move beyond the conventional idea of state power as understood in terms of the traditional concept of sovereignty. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p8.29">This conceptualisation of the autonomous state is linked to sovereignty as an immutable positivist phenomenon. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p8.29">One way in which the multi-level governance approach can explain the international relations that occur within the EU is via a revision of the concept of sovereignty so that it is understood as socially constructed and, hence, changeable. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p8.29">In this sense, the EU as a multi-level system of governance can effectively coexist with nation states - one does not imply the impossibility of the other.<ref target="BAWE_0255c-ftnote.016"/> Where perhaps Hooghe and Marks have erred is in relying on the traditional distinction between the international, or, in this case, the supranational, and the national to the extent of simply reversing rather than rectifying the old problematic. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p9.29">An effective use of the multi-level governance approach must include the following concepts: first, that the policy process, or any number of policy processes, are influenced by a variety of actors at different levels (the supranational, the national and the sub-national); secondly, that this dispersal of influence engenders a dispersal of authority whereby the nation state no longer monopolises governance; and, thirdly, that cross-border interactions within the EU have blurred the traditional distinction between the domestic and the international spheres. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p9.29">This represents the 'upwards', 'downwards' and 'horizontal' dispersal of authority "beyond" the state to supranational and local institutions as well as non-government organisations.<ref target="BAWE_0255c-ftnote.017"/> What it does not represent is the death of the nation state because it remains a vastly important level of governance.<ref target="BAWE_0255c-ftnote.018"/> In the work of Hooghe and Marks there is an emphasis on the empirical verification of state sovereignty as 'diluted' by these processes. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p24.29">There have been recent attempts to explain the changing nature of domestic institutions as a consequence of this idea of Europeanisation, where institutions have changed to meet the demands of EU policy. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p24.29">Christoph Knill and Dirk Lehmkuhl have identified three ways in which EU policy can affect domestic institutions. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p24.29">Firstly; by way of 'positive integration', EU policies impose direct pressure on national governance structures, usually implying that institutions must change in order to comply with EU law. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p24.29">For example, this has occurred in policy areas concerning 'environmental protection, health and safety...consumer protection' and so forth. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p24.29">Secondly; 'negative integration' - which does not directly impose necessities that force institutional change - causes a sort of national reappraisal of institutions and change may occur in order to maximise the benefits of EU policy at the domestic level. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p24.29">In this sense, 'the abolition of trade barriers for beer, for instance, has no impact on how the production of beer is regulated on the national level', but new forms of competition may require new domestic policies in order to remain competitive. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p24.29">Thirdly; 'framing integration' is a form of Europeanisation which changes attitudes in domestic politics thereby creating 'a degree of support mobilization for domestic reforms'.<ref target="BAWE_0255c-ftnote.053"/> </s>

<s n="s1.5;p25.29">Theories of Europeanisation advance our understanding of the 'varying adaptation' which is consequential of 'the extent to which European policy beliefs and ideas have mobilised the support of domestic actors for European reforms; and...the extent to which European support was sufficient to enable domestic reformers to put through national reforms in the light of given institutional opportunities and constraints'. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p25.29">Therefore, there is likely to be less support for implementing EU policies where there is a conflict with long standing institutional governance structures at the national level that require reform. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p25.29">In contrast, 'framing integration' aims at 'providing political leaders with additional legitimacy for their reform models, by assisting in the development of solutions for domestic problems or, finally, by altering the expectations and beliefs of domestic actors'.<ref target="BAWE_0255c-ftnote.054"/> The distinction between Europeanisation theories and the theory of integration as developed by Hooghe and Marks is that the former provide a useful explanation of the interaction between domestic and supranational actors and institutions without attempting to imply that this has profound relevance for the role of the state or that authority has shifted to the supranational level. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p25.29">As the multi-level governance approach demonstrates, there must be an explanation of how governance works rather than what it represents. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p27.29">Majone effectively and skilfully explains the rise of market regulation in Europe and explains how it proliferated within the EU polity.<ref target="BAWE_0255c-ftnote.057"/> His theory is constructed around the core theme of 'regulatory policy making' and three ideas that help to comprehend how it became a primary concern of EU governance are important: 'the tightness and rigidity of the Community budget; the desire of the Commission to increase its influence by expanding its competencies; and the preference of multi-national firms for dealing with a uniform set of rules rather than with...different national regulations'. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p27.29">He emphasises that traditional theories of European integration cannot explain these phenomena because they are unerringly state-centric and, therefore, ignorant of the role played by supranational institutions, trans-national corporations, non-government organisations and local governments. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p28.29">To over come this problem, a theory must explain the following: 'first, problems of "regulatory failure" in an international context, which limit the usefulness of purely intergovernmental solutions; and second, the fact that regulation, as a very specialised type of policy making, requires a high level of technical and administrative discretion'. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p28.29">Majone rightly identifies the Commission as a 'central node in a vast "issue network that includes not only experts from the national administrations, but independent experts...academics, public interest advocates like environmentalists and leaders of consumer movements, representatives of economic and professional organisations and of regional bodies'. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p28.29">Therefore, given the issues of budgetary concerns, economics, bureaucracy, 'the poor credibility of purely intergovernmental arrangements' and the high level of expertise required to handle regulatory policy making it is not surprising that the EU has experienced a proliferation of market regulation policy which has to take on an 'increasingly innovative character.<ref target="BAWE_0255c-ftnote.059"/> There is an explicit affinity with the multi-level governance approach to be found in Majone's work. </s>
