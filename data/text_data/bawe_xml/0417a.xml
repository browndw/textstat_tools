<quote lang="English">Claims for recognition often take the form of calling attention to the putative specificity of some group and then affirming its value, thereby tending to promote group differentiation. Claims for redistribution [of political and economic recourses], on the other hand, often call for abolishing economic institutions and arrangements that underpin group specificity. Accordingly, they tend to decrease differences between groups.<ref target="BAWE_0417a-ftnote.004"/>

<s n="s5.9;p8.27">Indeed this concept also integrates a major problem for the disability community - that of being labeled. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p8.27">However, Baxi's explanation of practices of identity illustrates a way out of the identity politics dilemma. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p8.27">The greatest concern with this theory is not whether it resolves the difficulties posed by multiple identities and the politics of difference, but whether it is practical in a world still heavily grounded in the concepts of individual and group rights. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p8.27">While the human rights model of practices of identity would allow for more voices in the disability movement (and all other movements), the reality of the situation is that the international human rights regime is still very much based on the premise that human rights must be either group rights or individual rights. </s>
