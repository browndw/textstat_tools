<p n="p1.76">
<s n="s1.2;p1.76">Undoubtedly, there are many companies that provide interesting case-studies for a discussion of their strategic marketing planning and the way that they have affected or been affected by the international marketing environment, its changes and its trends. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p1.76">Toyota with the implementation of Lean Manufacturing and Motorola with the adoption of Six Sigma principles are only two of the most well-known examples. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.76">
<s n="s1.1;p2.76">However, this assignment is based on <hi rend="bold">easyJet</hi>, a European Airline Industry which, by using a pioneering strategy, had a significant impact on the way that European airlines do business. </s>

<p n="p3.76">
<s n="s1.4;p3.76">The current assignment initially examines the company and its strategy. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p3.76">Following on, under the perspective of macro-environment, the main events and trends that have affected the European aviation market are presented and analysed. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p3.76">Moreover, micro-environment of easyJet is defined, and, in order to provide a clearer picture of the company, a SWOT analysis is presented. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p3.76">Furthermore, possible future events and trends and the way that marketeers should respond to them are examined and lastly, the conclusions drawn up from this analysis are set out. </s>

<head rend="bold italic">1.1 The Company</head>
<p n="p4.76">
<s n="s1.2;p4.76">According to the official web-site of easyJet (<seg type="URL" n="www.easyjet.com"/>), Stelios Haji-Ioannou founded the company and the family still remains the main shareholder. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p4.76">He is also responsible for some other easyGroup companies such as easyInternetcaf√©, easyMoney.com and easyHotel.com and although there are some "<hi rend="italic">cross-marketing</hi>" agreements, easyJet operates independently. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.76">
<s n="s1.2;p5.76">Gilligan and Wilson (2003, p. 490) mention that Mr. Haji-Ioannou based his policy on the low-cost US carrier, Southwest Airlines, considering how he could reinvent the airline operations practice. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p5.76">Focused on the low-cost company's ethos, he based easyJet at Luton (lower labour costs and airport fees than Heathrow or Gatwick) and whenever possible, he chose as easyJet's destinations, less busy secondary airports in Europe. </s>

</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="bold italic">1.2 The Strategy</head>
<p n="p6.76">
<s n="s1.2;p6.76">EasyJet has been always focused on eliminating any unnecessary costs and thus able to keep costs low by various ways. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p6.76">According to Gilligan and Wilson (2003, pp. 490-491) and to easyJet's official web-site, the ways of implementing its strategy are: </s>

<s n="s1.3;p8.76">
<hi rend="italic">Maximization of aircraft utilization</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p8.76">Instead of flying for 6 hrs/day (industry average), each easyJet's aircraft flies on average of 11.5 hrs/day. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p8.76">Thus, instead of using 3 aeroplanes, easyJet does the same work with 2. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p9.76">
<s n="s1.2;p9.76">
<hi rend="italic">Booking over the Internet</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p9.76">Having used the Internet to sell its first ticket in April 1998, today easyJet sells approximately 95% of all its seats over the Internet. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p10.76">
<hi rend="italic">Ticketless travel</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p10.76">All the transactions between customer and company are made with the use of credit card and the customer only receives a particular reference number, which should be with him at the check-in and of course a valid form of photographic ID. Thus, there is an important reduction on the cost of issuing, distributing, processing and reconciling millions of tickets each year. </s>

<p rend="bulleted" n="p11.76">
<s n="s1.4;p11.76">
<hi rend="italic">Selling drinks and refreshments, instead of offering a free lunch</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p11.76">It is worth mentioning Mr. Haji-Ioannous's opinion about free lunches: <hi rend="italic">"When someone is on a bus, he doesn't expect any free lunch.</hi> </s>
<s rend="italic" n="s3.4;p11.76">I couldn't see why we cannot educate our customers to expect no frills on board." </s>
<s n="s4.4;p11.76">(Gilligan and Wilson 2003, p. 491) </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p12.76">
<s n="s1.2;p12.76">
<hi rend="italic">No travel agents</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p12.76">Instead of using travel agents, easyJet prefers direct sales since agents and computer reservation systems can add 25% to operating costs. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p13.76">

<s n="s1.2;p15.76">
<hi rend="italic">One class of seating</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p15.76">On easyJet there are no business class passengers, thus no extra space is needed. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p16.76">
<s n="s1.4;p16.76">
<hi rend="italic">Yield management</hi>. easyJet uses a kind of lottery to sell flight seats. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p16.76">The more the demand for a ticket, the higher its price. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p16.76">This strategy has worked very well for easyJet, since a lot of passengers book their tickets well in advance for popular flights, anticipating cheaper tickets. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p16.76">The result of this policy is more than 80% of flights' seats are booked. </s>
</p>

<p n="p21.76">
<s n="s1.1;p21.76">According to Adcockal. (1998, p. 32) the Macro-Environment consists of uncontrollable variables such as Social, Technological, Economical and Political ones (also known as STEP), which companies have little influence over. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p23.76">Sweeney N. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p23.76">(2003) states that since people nowadays enjoy more free time, their demands for short trips for leisure have increased, leading to increasing sales of low-cost flight tickets. easyJet realised this trend and offers a variety of destinations throughout Europe, although recently it expanded its network to Africa (Morocco).

<head rend="bold">3.1.2 Environmental Consciousness</head>
<p n="p24.76">
<s n="s1.2;p24.76">During the last decade an increasing number of people have become concerned about green issues. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p24.76">Thus, it is very important for a company's image to be in accordance with any environmental legislation. </s>
</p>
<p n="p25.76">
<s n="s1.1;p25.76">According to DEFRA's (Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs) official web-site (<seg type="URL" n="www.defra.gov.uk"/>), European Union Emissions Trading Scheme <hi rend="italic">"...is one of the policies being introduced across Europe to tackle emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases and combat the serious threat of climate change</hi>". </s>
</p>
<p n="p26.76">
<s n="s1.1;p26.76">easyJet seems to be environmentally-focused and through its policy appears to be a strong supporter of EU ETS. easyJet uses brand new aeroplanes - thus reducing fuel consumption-, but also tries flying point-to-point rather than wasting resources on unnecessary connecting flights (easyJet's web-site, [25/10/06]). </s>
</p>
<p n="p27.76">
<s n="s1.1;p27.76">Moreover, according to easyJet-news, this environmental-friendly policy is further promoted by means such as the easyBus express, (a minibus connecting central London and Luton airport) and by encouraging people to use public transport to and from airports (easyJet advertises Stansted and Gatwick express trains by links on its home-page). </s>

<s n="s2.4;p33.76">Gilligan and Wilson (2003, p. 490) note that this resulted in an increase of new airlines that tried to enter the new and very promising market without, however, much success. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p33.76">A lot of them quickly faced various problems and by 1996, of the 80 companies that had started up, 60 went bankrupt. </s>

<p n="p34.76">
<s n="s1.2;p34.76">The expansion of the EU to include ten new countries -which actually signified ten new potential aviation markets- (Economist, 2004) has created a significant opportunity for easyJet. </s>

<p n="p36.76">
<s n="s1.1;p36.76">According to Adcockal. (1998, pp. 34-36) a company's micro-environment consists of some very important elements such as: The Company, the Competitors, the Suppliers, the Publics, the Marketing Intermediaries and the Customers. </s>
</p>
<p n="p37.76">
<s n="s1.1;p37.76">Although in the present assignment some of these elements have already been analysed (e.g. the Company, see 1.1, 1.2), many of them require a further analysis in order to fully describe the marketing environment. </s>

<head rend="bold italic">4.1 Suppliers </head>
<p n="p38.76">
<s n="s1.3;p38.76">According to easyJet's official web-site, Boeing (aircraft type: 737) and Airbus (aircraft type: A319) are the main suppliers of easyJet's aircrafts. </s>

<s n="s3.3;p38.76">Although Airbus A319 has some significant differences from the Boeing 737 (weight, size and number of seats), easyJet is orientated to use both of these aircrafts in the same way, consistent to its philosophy: <hi rend="italic">"any aircraft, any route"</hi>. </s>
</p>
<p n="p39.76">
<s n="s1.2;p39.76">However, it is believed that easyJet should attract the double amount of its current customers, in order to fill up its new fleet. </s>

</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="bold italic">4.2 Competitors</head>
<p n="p40.76">
<s n="s1.4;p40.76">As it has been stated before, the deregulation of European Airline Industry resulted in the increase of low-cost airlines. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p40.76">Thus, apart from the traditionally well-established airlines (i.e. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p40.76">KLM, BA) that easyJet had to face, there have been some new competitors too, such as Virgin Express, Ryanair and Air Berlin. </s>

<p n="p41.76">
<s n="s1.4;p41.76">In the case of an airline industry, the most common intermediary are travel agents. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p41.76">However with easyJet, things are slightly different since it does not use travel agents to promote its product. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p41.76">Instead it uses a direct sales policy through the Internet. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p41.76">Nevertheless, various web-sites that advertise and promote cheap flights could be considered as marketing intermediaries. </s>

<head rend="bold italic">4.4 Publics </head>
<p n="p42.76">
<s n="s1.1;p42.76">'Publics' is one of the most significant elements of Micro-Environment, since public opinion and social trends can affect a company's policy and reformulate its marketing strategy. easyJet tries to anticipate social trends and to be rather proactive than reactive to forthcoming social changes. </s>
</p>
<p n="p43.76">
<s n="s1.1;p43.76">Till now, easyJet's policy seems to be quite effective since it succeeded in establishing transactions through the Internet -making this policy a trend in the European aviation market- and furthermore, easyJet is focused on implementing environmental legislations (see 2.6), satisfying its consumers' environmental concerns. </s>

<p n="p45.76">
<s n="s1.1;p45.76">For easyJet, the target market are people who pay their tickets on their own, regardless of financial or social background (Gilligan and Wilson 2003, p. 492) and easyJet simply focuses on accomplishing what it has actually promised: low fares, safety, quality services and on-time performance. </s>
</p>
<p n="p46.76">
<s n="s1.2;p46.76">However, it is commonly stated that easyJet's customers are more concerned about the price of the ticket, rather than the service itself. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p46.76">Thus, brand loyalty to easyJet is rather rare and it must continuously vie for its market share. </s>

</p>
<p n="p64.76">
<s n="s1.1;p64.76">Furthermore, since new airlines will probably try to enter the low-cost airline market (i.e. subsidiaries of traditional companies) and the majority of easyJet's customers could not be characterised as brand loyal, easyJet must not only continue offering high-quality services at the same price, but also it must find ways to deter this entrance. </s>
</p>
<p n="p65.76">
<s n="s1.2;p65.76">In addition, Dibbal. (1996, p. 53) suggest that it is crucial for market leaders to keep a balance between protecting their existing position and searching for a new market share. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p65.76">If one examines easyJet as part of easyGroup, one could realise that Mr. Haji-Ioannou has tried to implement the strategy of keeping its market position and trying to find new market shares using easyGroup's companies (new products/ services). </s>

<p n="p71.76">
<s n="s1.3;p71.76">One may wonder why easyJet performed so well, especially when so many other airlines went bankrupt. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p71.76">The British Chartered Institute of Marketing have defined marketing as, "...<hi rend="italic">the management process responsible for identifying, anticipating and satisfying customer's requirements profitably."</hi> </s>
<s n="s3.3;p71.76">(Adcockal. 1998, p.3) </s>
</p>
<p n="p72.76">
<s n="s1.2;p72.76">It is clear that easyJet succeeded because it effectively implemented the aforementioned definition. easyJet identified people's need to travel inexpensively, anticipated the demand for affordable tickets and eventually satisfied customers' needs. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p72.76">It foresaw a 'market gap' and although it promoted a rather common 'product' (flight ticket), the 'philosophy' and the operations that lay behind it were particularly innovative. </s>
</p>
<p n="p73.76">
<s n="s1.1;p73.76">Furthermore, according to Proctor (2000, p. 16) <hi rend="italic">"An important dimension to strategic market management is to be proactive rather than simply reactive to environmental change"</hi>. </s>
</p>
<p n="p74.76">
<s n="s1.2;p74.76">easyJet achieved its goals by an efficient proactive strategy and managed to remain a market leader by putting into effect various innovative strategies. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p74.76">It also managed to keep up with the different social trends (i.e. green issues) and in some way, easyJet promoted in Europe the trend of booking flight tickets on-line. </s>
</p>
<p n="p75.76">
<s n="s1.2;p75.76">Secondly, one may wonder how easyJet managed to become one of the market leaders in such a competitive environment. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p75.76">According to Proctor (2000, p. 2), "<hi rend="italic">Competition involves finding a different way to satisfy customers from other companies in the market place</hi>". easyJet accomplished this, by reforming the traditional way of doing business and by finding alternative low-cost means of satisfying customers. </s>
</p>
<p n="p76.76">
<s n="s1.2;p76.76">Finally, the future development of easyJet will be probably based on the same 'tried and tested' principles. </s>
