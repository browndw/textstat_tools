</p>
<p n="p2.74">
<s n="s1.3;p2.74">On 7 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> April 2005 Renold issued a second profit warning in as many months.<ref target="BAWE_0249c-ftnote.001"/> Following close after the issue of the annual report this could be taken to indicate that management had failed to realise the full impact of the increased cost of raw materials would have upon their customer base. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p2.74">In fact Renold were in the red for the first six months of this financial year. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p2.74">Difficulties in the automotive industry in particular with lower orders than expected from GM, have added to Renold's problems. <ref target="BAWE_0249c-ftnote.002"/> </s>

<s n="s1.4;p3.74">Management are having little success in passing on cost increases to the automotive industry. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p3.74">The cost reduction programme, by moving manufacture to Poland continues, but talks on starting production in China are still underway. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p3.74">Share prices were 59p in April 2005 following the second Renold profit warning and only dropped to 58.5 p in December 2005 despite the companies continuing problems. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p3.74">With no further share dividends paid since January 28 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> 2005 this would not be a good time to purchase more shares in the company. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.74">
<s n="s1.2;p4.74">Therefore the recommendation would be to hold on to existing shares at this time. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p4.74">If the China talks are successful there is the possibility that Renold's position in 2006 could be greatly improved, especially if debts can also be reduced (by the sale of the Burton-on-Trent plant) as Renold management expect and the current strong order book continues. </s>
