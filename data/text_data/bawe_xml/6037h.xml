<p n="p41.47">
<s n="s1.1;p41.47">Both the method used achieved the aim of determining the protein content; however the Bradford method was more accurate, sensitive and easier as it only used one reagent. </s>
</p>
<p n="p42.47">
<s n="s1.4;p42.47">The Lowry method gave protein content values higher than expected results for all the samples ranging from 5.46 - 6.79 g/100 ml. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p42.47">The reason for these higher values may have been due to inaccurate dilution of the milk samples. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p42.47">The dilution of milk in the Lowry method was higher than in the Bradford method and this may account for the slightly higher results if dilution was slightly inaccurate. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p42.47">In both methods the dilution factor had to be taken into consideration in the calculations. </s>
</p>
<p n="p43.47">
<s n="s1.3;p43.47">The unknown sample had two different protein contents according to the methods used. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p43.47">The Lowry method determined protein content for the unknown sample of 6.79 g/100 ml where as the Bradford method had a value of 2.55 g/100 ml. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p43.47">The unknown sample may have been semi-skimmed milk as the literature value for its protein content is 3.3 g/100 ml and this value lies between the experimental values. </s>
</p>
<p n="p44.47">
<s n="s1.2;p44.47">The lower than expected absorbency readings on the BSA standard curves at 0.7 mg/ml may have been due to inadequate measurement of the BSA or mixing of the samples. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p44.47">This could be improved by using a more accurate pipette and thorough mixing of the samples using a vortex. </s>
</p>
<p n="p45.47">
<s n="s1.3;p45.47">The reproducibility of the Bradford method data is achievable and should produce accurate results as the method is sensitive, fast, and easy and has proved to be the preferred method as results match literature values. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p45.47">The Lowry method is less suitable to reproduce data as it is time consuming and produces a slightly wider range of results. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p45.47">However the results obtained by the Lowry method were only approximately 3 g above the literature value and this method is good for similar applications. </s>
</p>
<p n="p46.47">
<s n="s1.3;p46.47">According to the nutritional information on the label of whole milk, there is 3.4 g/100 ml protein. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p46.47">The result obtained for whole milk from the Bradford method was very close to the literature value at 3.46 g/ 100 ml. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p46.47">However the value obtained for the whole milk using the Lowry method was 5.76 g/100 ml, higher than the actual protein content. </s>
</p>
<p n="p47.47">
<s n="s1.2;p47.47">Protein content determination is important for both assessing the nutritional value of foodstuffs and estimating the population protein intake. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p47.47">Proteins are vital in the body as cells are composed of them and their metabolism regulated by them. </s>
