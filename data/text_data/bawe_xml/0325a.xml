<s n="s1.3;p23.25">Although Fourier himself had used these series to solve differential equations, he failed to provide a thorough explanation of them due to the absence of precise definitions of a function and an integral during his time.<ref target="BAWE_0325a-ftnote.005"/> At the time it was hardly considered that a series could not be integrated term by term, so Fourier series was the only trigonometric series used for representing a function. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p23.25">The question was, did it converge?<ref target="BAWE_0325a-ftnote.006"/> As far as Dirichlet was aware the only paper to have been written on the subject of the convergence of Fourier series was by Cauchy in 1826. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p24.25">Cauchy shows in his [1826] how Poisson's work on convergence had been non-rigorous, though ironically Dirichlet shows in his [1829] that Cauchy had also made an error: Cauchy took a convergent series, transformed it by means of complex function theory and resulted in the claim that the sum of a series of continuous functions is itself continuous. </s>
