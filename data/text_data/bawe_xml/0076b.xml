<s n="s1.3;p53.60">When the shadow exchange rate is higher than the current fixed exchange rate, it means that the currency is actually overvalued and should be depreciated. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p53.60">When there is a large enough domestic credit expansion that led to a higher shadow exchange rate than the fixed one, the fixed exchange rate regime must collapse and the exchange rate will jump to the shadow exchange rate in order to avoid an arbitrage opportunity. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p53.60">This is the reason for sudden exchange rate jump during the crises in 1990s. </s>

<s n="s2.3;p56.60">If <formula notation="" id="BAWE_0076b-form.029"/> (there is probability of fixed exchange rate regime to collapse), then the UIP will capture this and domestic interest rate is higher than foreign interest rate. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p56.60">This is the reason why interest differential rose over time before the crises. </s>

<p n="p57.60">
<s n="s1.2;p57.60">Such extensions are able to explain the behaviour of fixed exchange rate and interest differential observed from the crises but the "first generation" model is still unable to explain other problems. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p57.60">This is due to limitations of this model such as price stickiness in a country. </s>

<p n="p58.60">
<s n="s1.7;p58.60">In the model, it is assumed that prices are flexible in all countries. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p58.60">However, this is not true. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p58.60">So far, the empirical evidence showed that currency crises happened in regional area (Europe or East Asia) which also formed the country's main trading partners. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p58.60">For example, during the ERM crisis, UK and Italy had real exchange rate appreciation of about 10%. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p58.60">Furthermore, they have positive inflation differential with Germany and this has caused both UK and Italy to lose their competitiveness in terms of trade leading to sizeable trade deficits in both countries. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p58.60">During the crisis, both countries also experienced recessions and this might be caused by the overvaluation of their currencies. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p58.60">From this, it is evident that prices cannot be adjusted immediately even though the government has the intention of lowering inflation rates by joining a fixed exchange rate regime. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p59.60">Another limitation of this model is that it is not realistic enough by assuming the government's policies are exogenous. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p59.60">In this model, the policymaker is pursuing a constant rate of domestic credit expansion and made no effort to intervene until its reserves are exhausted. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p59.60">It should be allowed for the possibility of other policies adopted by the government and these should be endogenous policy decision for the government. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p60.60">The "first generation" speculative attack model is a traditional speculative attack model that is being referred to by many economists. </s>

<s n="s4.4;p60.60">It is the inconsistency of recent crises with the predictions of this model that has called for the development of further models, such as the "second generation" model which addresses the weaknesses of the "first generation" model". </s>
