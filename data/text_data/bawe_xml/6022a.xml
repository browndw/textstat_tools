<head>DISCUSSION</head>
<div2>
<head>Total Acidity:</head>
<p n="p44.60">
<s n="s1.1;p44.60">From the literature we know that the legal minimum values for the acidity of vinegar when expressed as Acetic Acid % are > 4%. </s>
</p>
<p n="p45.60">
<s n="s1.1;p45.60">From the results we obtained, we can clearly state that samples 1 and 3 generally meet the above minimum value, and sample 2 is far below the minimum requirements. </s>
</p>
<p n="p46.60">
<s n="s1.2;p46.60">Specifically, the first (5.45%) and third (6.41%) sample values are considered very high, and this can be contributed to the method. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p46.60">In this method we titrate not only acetic acid but all the acids that are in the samples, so this is an error based on the method that should be taken into serious consideration when expressing the results. </s>
</p>
<p n="p47.60">
<s n="s1.1;p47.60">As far as the second sample is concerned, the relative low value (2.96%) that is calculated can be justified by the fact that there might be mineral acids dissolved in the sample. </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head>pH paper:</head>
<p n="p48.60">
<s n="s1.1;p48.60">The literature values for pH in Vinegar are usually close to pH value ~3. </s>
</p>
<p n="p49.60">
<s n="s1.2;p49.60">From the results we have using the pH paper, we can observe that sample number 1 and 2 are very close to that value but the value for sample 3 is way far that value. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p49.60">Perhaps the presence of Mineral Acids (pH ~ 1-2) in the 3 <hi rend="sup">rd</hi> sample has altered this result. </s>
</p>
</div2>

<head>Reactions with silver nitrate and barium chloride solutions:</head>
<p n="p50.60">
<s n="s1.1;p50.60">We know that the test with the AgNO <hi rend="sub">3</hi> is a test to determine the presence of Cl- and the test using the BaCl <hi rend="sub">2</hi> is a test to determine SO <hi rend="sub">4</hi>-. </s>
</p>
<p n="p51.60">
<s n="s1.3;p51.60">After performing these tests, we observed that the tests using BaCl <hi rend="sub">2</hi> were all negative, something that indicates that there is no presence of SO <hi rend="sub">4</hi>- in our samples. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p51.60">When performing the tests using AgNO <hi rend="sub">3</hi> we observed turbidity and precipitants in samples1 and 2, and small turbidity in the tube containing sample 2. </s>
