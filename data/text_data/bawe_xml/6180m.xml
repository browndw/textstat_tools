<s n="s2.3;p1.20">The paper thus aims to establish a defensible form of relativism. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p1.20">In particular, I look at objections to and consequently forms of epistemological relativism (ER). </s>

<p n="p2.20">
<s n="s1.3;p2.20">The essay starts with clarifying the theory of relativism in general and clearly stating what form of ER is used in the essay. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p2.20">The rest of the essay looks at the objections which can be made to this version of general form of ER. Each objection, and to what extent is it able to withstand the objections which were made against relativism. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p2.20">The objections suggest that ER is mistaken as: it suggests that reality is shaped by our conceptual framework, the thesis of relativism--is true in some non-relativistic sense, the ER collapses into subjectivism and that it cannot evade that there is, after all, an absolute notion of truth. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.20">
<s n="s1.3;p3.20">The project aims to refine the theory so that it coheres with our intuitions. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p3.20">This is mostly done by specifying aspects of the form of relativism which have been criticised. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p3.20">The last part tries to sum up what is left of relativism after all objections are considered, and thus preset the viable / defensible form of ER. </s>

<p n="p4.20">
<s n="s1.4;p4.20">To begin with, more needs to be said about the relativist theory. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p4.20">Any relativist theory is a version of the main idea of relativism: "For all X-judgements, some feature, F, of an X-judgement is relative to Y." </s>
<s n="s3.4;p4.20">This essay considers cognitive or alethic version of relativist theory, where the scope of relativism is limited to relativism about truth variable of a judgement. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p4.20">The truth of a judgement is then relative to the conceptual framework of the thinker's epistemic community, which in other words is the domain of the judgement. </s>

<quote lang="English"> (AR) "The truth of any judgement is relative to the conceptual framework of the thinker's epistemic community." (Preston 1992:61)</quote>
<p n="p5.20">
<s n="s1.3;p5.20">In other words, whether something is true really only depends on the epistemic framework, ie the concept scheme the thinker has. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p5.20">Truth variability of a judgement then does not only depend on how thinks are but also on what things mean. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p5.20">Relativised truths can consequently tells us something about the epistemic framework. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.20">
<s n="s1.2;p6.20">One very useful argument to demonstrate how the theory is supposed to work in practice is the argument from paradigms<ref target="BAWE_6180m-ftnote.001"/>. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p6.20">One can understand the argument in the flowing way, if one start with different proposition or standards of what counts as a good argument, it is obvious that one will also come to different conclusions. </s>

<p n="p7.20">
<s n="s1.8;p7.20">One of the fundamental objections to AR, as argued by Whyte, is based on the distinction between what we hold for true and what really is true. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p7.20">AR asserts that truth of a proposition depends on the conceptual framework, i.e. the concepts which one holds. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p7.20">But this contradicts the equivalence principle (EP: "for any proposition 'p', the assertion that p is true if and only if p"<ref target="BAWE_6180m-ftnote.002"/>), as relativism would grant that people were true about various astronomical theories, e.g. the geocentric model of universe, which then turned out to be false. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p7.20">Consequently, if relativism about truth has an unrestrained scope to which proposition it applies, then a relativist must hold that while geocentric model was true in the times of Copernicus, Heliocentric model is true in our times, which is a blatant contradiction as only one of them can/could obtain. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p7.20">Relativism also needs to make sense of epistemic transitions, i.e. why people decided to abandon believes which were truth. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p7.20">Another incoherence which follows from AR + EP is that since in 14 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> century it was held to be true that the earth is flat, then people in that time must have lived on a so called Discworld©. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p7.20">If, as EP holds, reality copies truth and, as relativism argues, truth changes with our conceptual framework, then it would follow that <hi rend="bold"> reality is shaped by our conceptual framework.</hi> </s>
<s n="s8.8;p7.20">This, in the light of examples mentioned, seems counterintuitive, as it has inconsistent consequences. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p9.20">There are a few ways how relativism can respond, i.e. forms that it can take to avoid that this objection applies. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p9.20">In particular, a relativist can question whether the EP applies to relative truths as defined by the ER. While EP seems to hold for truths of absolute nature in certain areas, relativism on the other hand redefines the concept of truth in a way that makes it meaningless to apply EP. As ER subverts the concept of 'true' for 'true for', i.e. "p is the case relative to that person's conceptual scheme"<ref target="BAWE_6180m-ftnote.005"/>, "absolute categories are inapplicable." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_6180m-ftnote.006"/>
<s n="s3.5;p9.20">But for this to be possible, AR needs to limit the scope of judgements it applies to, or at least exclude the areas where EP clearly applies, e.g. physics, which tries to describe world as it is, in contrast to relativist world which is always relative to our framework. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p9.20">Thus a defensible form of ER would hold that p judgement is true in a specific way, namely p true for the thinker if it is true relative to the conceptual framework of the thinker's epistemic community, where this excludes knowledge where EP applies. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p9.20">Aesthetics is an area where ER can be applied without worries about inconsistency. </s>

<s n="s1.12;p12.20">There are two possible ways to respond to this. </s>
<s n="s2.12;p12.20">First, we can try to redefine the concept of absolute truth. </s>
<s n="s3.12;p12.20">A defensible form of total relativism would hold that absolute truths like the relativist thesis itself are possible in the world as painted by relativism. </s>
<s n="s4.12;p12.20">Absolutely true statements, in the sense that they are valid for every framework, are coherent with the relativist thesis / idea. </s>
<s n="s5.12;p12.20">For a statement to be valid / true for every framework, it would have to be true relative to each of the epistemic frameworks. </s>
<s n="s6.12;p12.20">This is possible if the statement is based on a part of the framework which obtains in every framework, this can be called the shared framework in the sense that each shares this part with every other epistemic framework. </s>
<s n="s7.12;p12.20">Thus a defensible form of ER redefines the notion of absolute truth, into truth which is true relatively to the shared framework. </s>
<s n="s8.12;p12.20">This changes the picture form a number of separate frameworks to a web of frameworks which share a common middle ground. </s>
<s n="s9.12;p12.20">While this means that a total relativist thesis does not necessarily have to be self-refuting, a redefinition of absolute truth does not mean that the shared framework is a sufficient base for the thesis. </s>
<s n="s10.12;p12.20">The shared framework, or the middle ground, needs to sufficiently complex so that ER can be told to be true for it. </s>
<s n="s11.12;p12.20">For this to work, we would have to take a closer look at what actually obtains as a shared epistemic framework. </s>

<s n="s3.5;p13.20">Diverging secure attunements, i.e. "the places where the community draws the limits of rational discourse,"<ref target="BAWE_6180m-ftnote.010"/> will produce differences in what counts as a reason and consequently disagreements, as to what exactly is true relative to which framework. </s>
