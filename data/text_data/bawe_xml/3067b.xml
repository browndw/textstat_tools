<p rend="bulleted" n="p4.18">
<s n="s1.6;p4.18">Publishers: After the lawsuit of the Association of American Publishers (AAP) on behalf of five major publisher members, there is a continuation of accusing GBS of copyright violation. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p4.18">Some publishers, e.g. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p4.18">Bloomsbury, strongly disagree what GBS has been doing. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p4.18">They are calling on internet users to boycott Google. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p4.18">(The Guardian, Mar 4, 06) However, other publishers, e.g. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p7.18">GBS is a new thing facing international publishing. </s>

<s n="s4.6;p7.18">Its operational idea and business model is totally different from what publishing industry is like. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p7.18">Moreover, its ambitious plan is so big to not only involve all publishing-related people, but also include some in-copyright books. </s>

<s n="s2.4;p11.18">Normally, publishing is a business of money-spending on Ad or promotion. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p11.18">But GBS is a new business model which is based on splitting advertising revenue with publishers. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p13.18">Google was found in Sept 1998 and headquartered in USA. Now it has grown up as one of global leading internet searching service companies with over 5000 employees working in about 20 overseas offices in the world. </s>

<s n="s3.3;p16.18">Possibly, this is why it can make a quick response to issues aroused GBS and took a effective solution to the relevant issues, e.g. starting to use the name of GBS with more precise business orientation; extending GBS from Book Library Project (BLP) only to including BLP and "Google Books Partner Programme - for publishers' service" </s>
