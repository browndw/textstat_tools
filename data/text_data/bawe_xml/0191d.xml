<s n="s2.5;p4.18">James must first obtain the leave of the court; this is based on the existence of an arguable case. </s>

<s n="s2.5;p5.18">"A litigant who seeks redress for a public law wrong in a private action must establish, in order to have standing, that the public law wrong has invaded some legal right of his or hers, recognized in private law, or has caused him or her some special damage." </s>

<s n="s4.4;p8.18">However, James is not guaranteed a remedy, since judicial review does not always afford the citizen redress, and the granting of a remedy and the ultimate success of the application is discretionary. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.18">
<s n="s1.6;p9.18">A significant element of the motivation for James to apply for judicial review is derived from the fact that the action sanctioned by the new policy of the local authority, i.e. the construction of the proposed factory outlets, has not yet begun. </s>

<s n="s3.6;p9.18">However, in the event that the construction process had begun, it is probable that the possibility of James succeeding in his claims would be further complicated, though it would not affect his capability to take legal action, except of course in terms of technicalities such as time limits. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p10.18">The case of <hi rend="italic">Fleet Street Casuals</hi>
<ref target="BAWE_0191d-ftnote.012"/>, despite being a leading case on interpretation of the rule of standing, leaves a certain amount of uncertainty as to the precise legal principles that apply to the law of standing; though a liberal approach to standing was taken, there was a large measure of judicial discretion, and it is doubtful whether there is a single test for standing under the new procedures under Order 53. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p10.18">Since standing is, in practice, a matter of "mixed law and fact", the determination of whether "Save Our Green Peace" has sufficient interest is dependant upon statutory interpretation, the general context of the case, and judicial discretion.<ref target="BAWE_0191d-ftnote.013"/> From <hi rend="italic">Fleet Street Casuals</hi>, it is clear that the question of what constitutes sufficient interest is partly a question of legal principle and partly of fact, to be decided in the light of the circumstances of the case before the court. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p10.18">"So it will often be impossible to be entirely sure, in advance of litigation, whether any particular applicant has a sufficient interest." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0191d-ftnote.014"/>
<s n="s4.4;p10.18">Thus, the question of sufficient interest has to be judged in the light of the relevant statutory provisions, the substance of the applicant's complaint, whether the case raises issues that are justiciable, and the seriousness of the alleged illegality. </s>

</p>
<p n="p12.18">
<s n="s1.14;p12.18">That there is a fundamental objection to citizens challenging a decision of a public authority has been adequately demonstrated by the restrictive view of public interest litigation taken by the courts in the <hi rend="italic">Rose Theatre</hi> case. </s>
<s n="s2.14;p12.18">Schiemann J. considered the question of whether standing had been established by the trust formed from local residents, consisting of archaeologists of a certain expertise and leading actors. </s>
<s n="s3.14;p12.18">It was found that where a number of individuals do not have an interest, the act of their joining together to form a group does not create an interest for the group thus formed. </s>
<s n="s4.14;p12.18">Thus, despite being concerned with the preservation of national heritage, and possessing expert knowledge about the monument, it was found that the applicants failed to meet the requirements for standing, and that in fact, upon consideration, no individual had the standing to move for judicial review. </s>
<s n="s5.14;p12.18">This approach is unduly protective of the powers of the Secretary of State, and reflects a reluctance on the part of the courts to become a channel for pressure group activity, possibly on the basis of the administrative difficulties that would be consequent to an increased volume of judicial review, and also on the grounds that the formulation of policy is the task of the Parliament, rather than that of courts.<ref target="BAWE_0191d-ftnote.015"/> The crucial distinction in the context of standing, however, is whether the private interest of the applicant is affected, or if judicial review is sought not for the recognition or enforcement of some private right, but simply on the basis of the wider public interest, or as an attempt to regulate official power. </s>
<s n="s6.14;p12.18">Challenges of the latter sort have been permitted by the courts on a restrictive basis, but mainly in the context of large, well known groups, such as Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace and the World Development Movement, which play an important role in the lobbying process for the protection of the environment. </s>
<s n="s7.14;p12.18">Five years after <hi rend="italic">Rose Theatre</hi>, the important role of pressure groups was highlighted with the <hi rend="italic">Pergau Dam</hi>
<ref target="BAWE_0191d-ftnote.016"/> case, where the World Development Movement successfully challenged the payments from the overseas aid budget to build a dam in Malaysia. </s>
<s n="s8.14;p12.18">Both the cases have a number of implications for the future of pressure group activity through the courts; am important question raised is that of the role of membership in helping a pressure group overcome the rules of standing. </s>
<s n="s9.14;p12.18">"The Law Commission... has acknowledged that interest groups may have good grounds for having standing, in the public interest, to make an application for judicial review." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0191d-ftnote.017"/>
<s n="s10.14;p12.18">However, the judicial approach towards permitting pressure groups to bring a matter of public interest before the court is quite flexible and thus fairly unpredictable. </s>
<s n="s11.14;p12.18">The <hi rend="italic">Rose Theatre</hi> case can be interpreted in such a way as to suggest that an ordinary citizen, in the absence of an express statutory right is unable to challenge decisions, even where this would serve public interest. </s>
<s n="s12.14;p12.18">In the case before us, it appears that the local movement "Save Our Green Space", with charitable status and is concerned with religious, ecological and environmental principles, may move for leave for judicial review; however, the result of such an action cannot be determined with any certainty. </s>
<s n="s13.14;p12.18">After <hi rend="italic">Pergau Dam</hi>, there is a possibility that it might be successful. </s>
<s n="s14.14;p12.18">One factor that is to its advantage is that it is an established pressure group, unlike that in Rose Theatre, which was created specifically for the purpose of dealing with the issue at hand. </s>
