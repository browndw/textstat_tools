<s n="s1.1;p1.68">Formation of the vertebrate limb requires specification of cell position along 3 axes: the proximal-distal axis, the antero-posterior axis and the dorso-ventral axis. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.68">
<s n="s1.2;p2.68">These 3 axes are governed by signalling centres: the apical ectodermal ridge and the progress zone for the proximal distal elements, the polarizing activity region for the antero-posterior axis and the overlying ectoderm that determines the dorso-ventral axis. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p2.68">These signalling centres emanate proteins which cross-talk linking the formation of each axis to each other. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.68">
<s n="s1.3;p3.68">A decade of intensive studies has identified some signals that pattern the different axes. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p3.68">The apical ectodermal ridge releases Fibroblast growth fators (Fgfs) in particular Fgf- 4 and Fgf-8 which mimic it if removed. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p3.68">Fgf-8 is also involved in the formation of the fore and hind limb formation as it forms a feedback loop with Fgf-10 mediated by Wnt3a, which is induced by Tbx 5 and 4 via Wnt2b and Wnt8c respectively. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.68">
<s n="s1.2;p4.68">The polarizing activity region releases Sonic Hegdhog (Shh), a limb morphogen, which is induced by Gli3 a protein implicated in human Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome, which forms a feedback loop (mediated by Formin, Gremlin, a Bmp antagonist and of course Bmp) with Fgf-8 and Fgf-4. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p4.68">Sonic Hedgehog is also induced by dHand, a transcription factor, and in the forelimb by Hoxb8. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.68">
<s n="s1.3;p5.68">However, dorso-ventral patterning is very different as it does not rely on a gradient of expression but more on an ON/OFF system. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p5.68">Wnt7a, another member of the Wnt family, is restricted to the dorsal region by Engrailed1 and induces the expression of <hi rend="italic">Lmx1</hi> without Î²-catenin dependent activity to specify the dorsal fate. </s>

<s n="s2.3;p6.68">This is an extremely complex organ, which is not necessary for embryonic survival (therefore makes it a fantastic candidate for studying how structures develop in the right places in the embryo), is initiated when the vertebrate body plan is being mapped out and finished when the precise array of organised cells and tissues have been generated. </s>

</p>
<p n="p7.68">
<s n="s1.2;p7.68">Limb patterning is established along 3 dimensions: the proximal-distal axis which consists in the replacement of the initial cartilage by bone and accompanied by the rises of the stylopod (humerus/femur), zeugopod (radius, ulna/ tibia and fibula) and autopod (carpal fingers/ankle and toes). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p7.68">The second axis is the anterior-posterior axis (thumb to little finger) and finally the third one is the dorsal-ventral axis (knuckles/palm respectively). </s>

<s n="s3.3;p11.68">Following their migration, they are concentrated at the dorso-ventral junction of the limb bud and this defines the compaction step (see section III) (Tickle, 2004; Niswander, 2003). </s>

<s n="s1.1;p12.68">Following experiments in which the entire ridge was removed and resulted in the cessation of outgrowth and a truncated limb, it was concluded that this organization centre is critical for the developing limb and each step mentioned is mediated by key signal which will be discussed later (Mahmood <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 1995; Niswander <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 1993; Niswander, 2003). </s>

<head>Figure 3. The progress zone model (at the top) versus the early specification model (at the bottom) proposed by Dudley <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> . Interaction between the AER and the progress zone was discovered through the removal of the ridge at progressive stages which resulted in more distal limbs truncation (Niswander, 2003). This observation led to the proposal of the progress zone model which states that the length of time mesenchyme cells spend in the progress zone determines the positional value they acquire, in other words distal or proximal (Niswander, 2003; Tickle, 2004). Although it is the most popular model, an alternative model has been suggested by Dudley <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> in 2002 to explain the phenotype that results from AER removal: all proximal-distal fates are already specified in the early bud and the role of AER is to promote expansion and differentiation of the different limb elements in a proximal-distal sequence. The stylopod precursor is represented in blue, the zeugopod precursor in black and the autopod precursor in red. The shaded zone represents the progress zone.

<s n="s1.3;p17.68">AER function is specified by the fibroblast growth factors (Fgfs). </s>
<s n="s2.3;p17.68">It is a gene family containing 15 known members that encode heparin-binding proteins which most of them are secreted constitutively. </s>

</p>
<p n="p18.68">
<s n="s1.1;p18.68">These genes were identified to encode the outgrowth signals as beads soaked in Fgf could substitute for the apical ectodermal ridge and sustain limb bud outgrowth (Niswander <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 1993; Tickle, 2004; Mahmood <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 1995). </s>
</p>
<p n="p19.68">
<s n="s1.2;p19.68">Two protein members seem to be more involved than the others: Fgf-4 and Fgf-8. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p19.68">Although these proteins have the same overall effect, their signal transduction pathway differs greatly. </s>
</p>
<p n="p20.68">
<s n="s1.2;p20.68">Fgf-8, previously identified as androgen-induced growth factor, is believed to be the most divergent member of the family since its amino acid sequence shows the least similarity than the others. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p20.68">It therefore probably regulates developmental processes not previously associated with Fgfs (Mahmood <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 1995). </s>
</p>
<p n="p21.68">
<s n="s1.2;p21.68">
<hi rend="italic">Fgf-8</hi> is expressed in all three germ layers and in 2 neuromeric boundary regions of the brain (Mahmood <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 1995). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p21.68">Its expression in those regions suggests that it might affect morphogenetic movements or cell adhesive processes that help to establish the initial number of cell in the early limb bud and the also play a role in spatial organization (Mahmood <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 1995; Niswander, 2003). </s>
</p>
<p n="p22.68">
<s n="s1.1;p22.68">Interestingly, the use of whole-mount RNA in situ hybridization, has detected <hi rend="italic">Fgf-8</hi> RNA in nephrogenic mesoderm cells adjacent to the Wolfian duct prior to their differentiation, suggesting that its expression is linked to embryonic kidney development and has very important role in tubulogenesis (Crossley <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 1996). </s>
</p>
<p n="p23.68">
<s n="s1.4;p23.68">However, the most striking role of Fgf-8 is in its involvement in AER derived mitogenic activity that regulates limb bud outgrowth (see section B). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p23.68">This was stated due to its presence in the ectoderm of limb bud prior to the onset of limb bud growth in both mouse and chicken embryos. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p23.68">However, it is not sufficient to induce a limb; it probably acts in conjunction with other determinants such as retinoic acid or other <hi rend="italic">Hox</hi> genes. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p23.68">It is also involved in the compaction step of the ridge formation (Niswander, 2003). </s>
</p>
<p n="p24.68">
<s n="s1.4;p24.68">This protein signals through Fgfr2, which belongs to the fibroblast growth factor receptor family. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p24.68">This is a group of four transmembrane proteins with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity (Xu <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 1998). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p24.68">They all share common features (they are listed in table 1 along with their role) and all have the same signalling pathway. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p24.68">See figure 5 for a schematic representation. </s>

<figure id="BAWE_0103a-fig.002">
<head>Figure 5. Schematic representation of the Fgfrs signalling. The FGFs induce formation of receptor homodimers. The dimerisation activates the receptor in each monomer, by undergoing mutual phosphorylation, (each subunit phosphorylates multiple tyrosine residues on the other subunit), which subsequently provides binding sites for target proteins such as protein phosphatases, protein tyrosine kinases and many more. These target proteins, in this case, an adaptor protein binds to the phosphorylated residues via its SH2 domain (these are independent structures found in many proteins). The adaptor protein also contains 2 SH3 domains and binds to the GEF, which activates ras (attached to the membrane through its farnesyl group). Ras then binds to MAPK3 (mitogen activate protein kinase 3), activating the MAP kinase cascade. The overall result is growth and cell differentiation. Adapted from Davey, 2005.</head>

<p n="p25.68">
<s n="s1.3;p25.68">But the most important domain is the immunoglobulin (Ig) like domain. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p25.68">Deletion of this domain or inactivation using a Cre recombinase uncouples the interaction between Fgf-8 and Fgf-10 (which defines the reciprocal regulation loop) resulting in limbless embryos (Xu <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 1998). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p25.68">It is therefore critical for Fgf binding and for normal Fgfr2 activity. </s>

<figure id="BAWE_0103a-pic.004">
<head>Figure 6. Reciprocal regulation loop during limb induction. As stated earlier on, <hi rend="italic">Fgf-10</hi> is required for limb outgrowth and its expression on the mesenchyme precedes <hi rend="italic">Fgf-8</hi> expression (Moon and Capecchi, 2000; Xu <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> ., 1998). Fgfr2IIIb, a major isoform of the receptor, is localized to the surface ectoderm and interacts with Fgf-10 (cells expressing Fgfr2IIIb proliferate due to promotion by Fgf-10) and induces <hi rend="italic">Fgf-8</hi> expression. Reduction of the expression of <hi rend="italic">Fgf-8</hi> results in a decreased <hi rend="italic">Fgf10</hi> expression in both the anterior and posterior extremes of the mesenchyme (Moon and Capecchi, 2000). This shows that Fgf-8 signalling in turn positively regulates <hi rend="italic">Fgf-10</hi> . FGF-8 does so by interacting with Fgfr2IIIc, which is expressed in the adjacent mesoderm, induces and maintains Shh (Crossley et al., 1996). However, the latter statement clashes with results from Mahmood <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> . (1995) in which addition of the protein after removal of the ridge failed to maintain <hi rend="italic">Shh</hi> expression in the posterior mesoderm. A possible explanation of this discrepancy is that different Fgf-8 isoforms have different functions in vivo (different isoforms were used in each experiments). Source: Adapted from Xu <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> ., 1998 and Niswander <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> ., 1993.<hi rend="bold">Note:</hi> Fgfr2 is not only limited to limb induction, it is also essential for placental formation. Defect in Fgfr2 results in a block in the trophoblast cell proliferation and the outcome is a failure in labyrinthine portion of placenta (Xu <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> ., 1998).</head>

<s n="s3.5;p27.68">Fgf-4 is efficiently secreted from cells and along with Fgf-9 and Fgf-17 is expressed in the posterior part of the ridge (Niswander <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 1993; Tickle, 2004). </s>
<s n="s4.5;p27.68">Fgf-4 can also substitute for the ridge but although the limb develops completely, there are a few digit abnormalities. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p27.68">This suggests that Fgf-4 does not perform the mechanical function of the ridge (Niswander <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 1993). </s>

<s n="s2.2;p29.68">Another feature in which Fgf-8 differs from Fgf-4 is that the latter is critical for the progress zone cell proliferation (Niswander <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 1993). </s>
