<p n="p1.151">
<s n="s1.4;p1.151">Cryptography is the art of sending secret messages. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p1.151">For thousands of years it has been used by governments, terrorists and lovers to keep their correspondence from being read; during that time it has changed the course of wars and condemned people to death. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p1.151">However it is only with the birth of the internet that cryptography has been used by more than a select few. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p1.151">Cryptography is fundamental to how we use the internet and to modern e-commerce, for example anyone who has ever bought or sold something online has had their credit card details encrypted. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.151">
<s n="s1.9;p2.151">Traditionally and for thousands of years people have used what is known as private-key cryptography. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p2.151">As is traditional in texts on cryptography I shall refer to the receiver and sender of secret messages as Alice and Bob (rather than just A and B). </s>
<s n="s3.9;p2.151">Suppose Bob wants to send a secret message to Alice using a private-key cryptosystem. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p2.151">In order to do this Alice and Bob must previously agree on an encryption/decryption method and on a <hi rend="italic">key</hi>. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p2.151">This would typically be: a special number or phrase, a table of what to encode different letters and words as, or even the specific settings of a decryption/encryption machine such as the famous German Enigma machine used in WWII. Once these are agreed upon (secretly of course) Bob applies the encryption method using the key to the plaintext message he want to send Alice in order to get a ciphertext which he communicates to Alice. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p2.151">On receiving the ciphertext Alice applies the decryption method using the key to reveal the plaintext message (see fig. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p2.151">1). </s>
<s n="s8.9;p2.151">Ideally an eavesdropper (traditionally known as Eve) who intercepted the ciphertext would find it extremely difficult (preferably impossible) to derive the original plaintext message since she will not have the required key. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p2.151">Ideally there will a very large number of possible keys to prevent Eve just guessing the correct one. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.151">
<s n="s1.3;p3.151">A simple example of a private key cryptosystem is what is known as a monoaphabetic substitution cipher; in this system each letter of the alphabet is replaced by a different letter and the resulting text forms the ciphertext. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p3.151">The key in this case is a table mapping each letter to its replacement. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p3.151">Decryption is obviously straightforward if you have this key but much harder if you don't; although it is in fact possible by analyzing the frequency of the different letters as first described by the Arab scientist al-Kindi in the ninth century. </s>
</p>

<head>Figure 1: Schematic of private-key cryptography</head>
</figure>
<p n="p4.151">
<s n="s1.5;p4.151">There is however a major problem inherent in private-key Cryptography: that of agreeing on the key itself. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p4.151">Alice and Bob must both have knowledge of the key before the secret message can be sent. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p4.151">The key needs to be agreed upon secretly and this causes both security and logistical issues. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p4.151">At first this wasn't much of a problem: a general such as Julius Caesar could agree a key with people in Rome before heading off on campaign. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p4.151">But with the communications revolution of the 19 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 20 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> centuries (telegraph, radio, telephone etc.) governments and businesses needing to communicate in secret still had to courier the keys by hand, leading to huge logistical costs and potential for treachery by the couriers. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.151">
<s n="s1.4;p5.151">The problem of key distribution grew even more serious with the birth of modern computing and the internet. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p5.151">How could two people (who might be the other side of the world from each other), meeting on the internet and wishing to communicate in secret, ever hope to do so? </s>
<s n="s3.4;p5.151">To send a message secretly they must agree on a key, but there is no way to send this key to begin with without risking it being intercepted. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p5.151">Before this problem was solved modern e-commerce was impossible. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.151">
<s n="s1.2;p6.151">The beginnings of a solution to this problem came in 1975, from three American cryptographers: Ralf Merckle, Whitfield Diffie, and Martin Hellmann. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p6.151">They developed an idea known as public-key cryptography. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.151">
<s n="s1.5;p7.151">In this system there are two keys, a public-key and a private-key. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p7.151">If Bob wants to send a message to Alice, then this time Alice takes the initiative: she picks a private-key and keeps it secret even from Bob, from this she derives a second public-key in some way from the private-key and makes this public-key freely available for anyone to see and use to send her secret messages. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p7.151">Bob then uses Alice's public-key to encrypt his plaintext message which he transmits to Alice. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p7.151">However in public-key cryptography the encryption/decryption method is designed such that while the public-key can be used for encrypting messages, only Alice's secret private-key can be used to decrypt the ciphertext (see fig. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p7.151">2). </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.151">
<s n="s1.1;p8.151">Our eavesdropper Eve has access to both the Public Key and the ciphertext but still cannot derive the plaintext from these. </s>
</p>
<figure id="BAWE_0052a-pic.002">
<head>Figure 2: Schematic of public-key cryptography</head>
</figure>
<p n="p9.151">
<s n="s1.2;p9.151">The huge advantage of this system is that there are no logistical or security issues in agreeing on a Key since the public-key can be made available to everyone; it no longer has to be a secret so can be transmitted safely on the same medium as the ciphertext will be. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p9.151">Such systems allow <hi rend="italic">secure and practical</hi> communication over the internet. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.151">
<s n="s1.4;p10.151">Merckle, Diffie, and Hellmann had come up with the general concept of this system but hadn't come up with a practical example. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p10.151">A key requirement of this system is that the public-key can be derived from the private-key easily but not vice-versa (otherwise Eve could easily convert the freely available public-key into the private-key and hence decrypt the plaintext). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p10.151">Mathematically what was needed was some kind on "one way function" which is "easy" to compute but with a "hard" to compute inverse. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p10.151">Here "easy" means computable in a reasonable amount of time (such as a few seconds) and "hard" means only computable in an unreasonable amount of time (such as a million years). </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.151">
<s n="s1.4;p11.151">The search for a practical implementation of a public-key cryptosystem took two years. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p11.151">In 1977 the computer scientists Ron Rivest and Adi Shamir along with the mathematician Len Adlemen published a joint paper [1] describing what came to be known as RSA (after their initials). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p11.151">The basic idea is this: Alice chooses two large prime numbers p and q, she multiplies them together to get N. The "one way function" is this multiplication, multiplying p and q to get N is quick to do, but p and q can only be deduced from N by prime factorization; however this is extremely time consuming for large N (as we shall see later). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p11.151">The actual detail of the method is more complex and I will describe how it works in the next section before proving <hi rend="italic">why</hi> it works mathematically. </s>

<s n="s2.6;p151.151">Hundreds of years ago when mathematicians like Euler and Fermat were proving the theorems that make RSA possible, it would have been absolutely inconceivable that their work in this area of number theory, one of the purest topics in pure mathematics, could ever have any kind of practical application. </s>
