<head>Analysis of history</head>
<p n="p13.33">
<s n="s1.11;p13.33">The presenting symptoms (i.e. wheezing, breathlessness, reduced PEFR) are typical of an acute asthma attack and given Mr <name type="other"/>'s history of chronic asthma, this is the most likely diagnosis. </s>
<s n="s2.11;p13.33">The onset of breathlessness at night also points towards asthma. </s>
<s n="s3.11;p13.33">As <name type="other"/> appears to be a particularly fragile asthmatic, it is likely that his recent infection has precipitated this acute attack. </s>
<s n="s4.11;p13.33">On admission <name type="other"/> was unable to complete sentences and his PEFR was significantly reduced (38% of normal) indicating an acute severe attack. </s>
<s n="s5.11;p13.33">A PEFR between 33%-50% usually suggests a severe attack, whilst &lt;38% is regarded as life-threatening. </s>
<s n="s6.11;p13.33">On examination, the respiratory and cardiovascular systems should be examined. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p13.33">Specific signs should be sought in order to allow the severity to be assessed further. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p13.33">For example an increased respiratory rate (>25/min) and tachycardia (>110/min) would be expected in a severe attack. </s>
<s n="s9.11;p13.33">However bradycardia, hypotension and a reduced respiratory effort (or silent chest) may develop as the episode increases in severity and becomes life threatening. </s>
<s n="s10.11;p13.33">Other signs associated with hypoxia may also occur in life-threatening attack such as cyanosis, exhaustion and confusion. </s>
<s n="s11.11;p13.33">ABG values are also important for assessing the severity therefore results will be obtained if available. </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.33">
<s n="s1.5;p14.33">Important differential diagnoses to exclude would include an acute infective exacerbation of COPD, pulmonary oedema (cardiac asthma), URTI, PE, pneumothorax, anaphylactic shock and airway obstruction by a foreign body or tumour. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p14.33">Most of these are unlikely given his history. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p14.33">For example Mr <name type="other"/> has no history of COPD, has never smoked and has not travelled recently. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p14.33">On admission, a CXR would be performed and therefore allow pneumothorax, pleural oedema and infection to be ruled out. </s>

<s n="s4.5;p30.33">Two weeks later at clinic, he reported a stable PEFR of around 450-500 and despite one incidence of dyspnoea, which required the use of home oxygen (for ~1.5hrs) he was generally well. </s>

<p n="p32.33">
<s n="s1.4;p32.33">Asthma is increasing in prevalence, particularly in the Western world, where approximately 5-15% of the population may be symptomatic and receiving treatment. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p32.33">However despite improvements in treatment, mortality rates have also been decreasing and asthma accounts for almost 1500 deaths per year in the UK. Interestingly there is also a geographical variation, with the condition being more common in developed countries such UK, New Zealand and Australia where some of the highest rates can be found. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p32.33">In contrast, asthma is much more rare in Africa, Central Europe and Far Eastern countries such as China and Malaysia. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p32.33">Studies investigating this variation have shown a correlation with 'Westernised' life-styles that include living conditions that favour house-dust mites and atmospheric pollution (Ward et al, 2002). </s>

<s n="s1.5;p33.33">This case has highlighted the importance of rapidly diagnosing and initiating treatment in patients with a suspected asthma attack. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p33.33">In a case such as this it is essential that appropriate therapy is given immediately with a view to regaining control of the asthma, no matter what the cause of the attack. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p33.33">These patients should be closely supervised and subsequent re-assessment should be carried out frequently to ensure that any further deterioration is detected and addressed appropriately. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p33.33">Once the patient has been stabilised, further investigations should be performed to identify potential causes for the acute exacerbation (e.g. infection, recent change in medication). </s>
<s n="s5.5;p33.33">This case has also highlighted the importance of patient education and the need to consider psychosocial factors such as unemployment when treating chronic asthmatics. </s>
