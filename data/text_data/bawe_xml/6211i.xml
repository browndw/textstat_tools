<quote lang="English">'"Progress" is a notion alien to Egypt and most ancient cultures, which view the current and future ages as "regressions" from an ideal "Golden Age" when mankind and divinity more closely interacted. In Egypt, the notion of an ideal past is linked to complex philosophical understandings of time itself, viewed as a repeating cycle or spiral capable of being manipulated by ritual. On the theoretical level, "progress" was neither desirable nor necessary'<ref target="BAWE_6211i-ftnote.003"/>.</quote>

<s n="s1.4;p21.25">My final criticism concerns the lack of working definitions within the article. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p21.25">Namely the use of the terms 'rational' and 'irrational' are both unhelpful and not applicable to Egypt or Greece. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p21.25">This problem is not an isolated one and various scholars utilize a variety of terms when discussing this subject. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p21.25">Although I have difficulty in deciding upon accurate terms to use for this discussion, in my opinion, the term 'irrational' must be abandoned for several reasons. </s>
</p>
<p n="p22.25">
<s n="s1.2;p22.25">Firstly, the term 'irrational' is not remotely applicable to Greek or Egyptian medical practice let alone any other culture, since what we tend to deem as 'magical' are based on complex theories about the nature of the cosmos and are, therefore, hardly irrational. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p22.25">Furthermore, David is the first to use 'irrational' and intriguingly even the title of the work in which her article is published is called 'Magic and Rationality in Ancient Near Eastern and Graeco-Roman Medicine'. </s>
</p>
<p n="p23.25">
<s n="s1.3;p23.25">Another term used by Pinch in place of 'irrational' is 'supernatural'<ref target="BAWE_6211i-ftnote.029"/>. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p23.25">This in itself is a slight improvement. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p23.25">However, an observation by Collins that in Classical thought, the gods were not supernatural but within the confines of nature, makes this a dubious replacement, since Egyptian thought probably matched Classical thinking. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p24.25">The real culprit word in terms of definitions is 'medicine'. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p24.25">To a reader it evokes modern medical science and already causes anachronism before any talk of ancient healing practices are mentioned. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p24.25">The way in which it is used is also instructive to those examining modern attitudes to the art of healing. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p24.25">No mention is ever made in scholarship of a 'medical amulet' or a 'medical spell'; they are called 'healing amulets' and 'healing spells'<ref target="BAWE_6211i-ftnote.030"/>. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p24.25">The one exception to this rule concerns the 'medical papyri' but often this appears to be allowed since no one papyrus is either solely 'magical' without accompanying prescriptions or anatomical works. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p24.25">Even in the one case where the term 'medical' is applied to an ancient document, the reader unacquainted with the text may not be aware of its partly 'magical' content. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p24.25">The use of 'magical' in healing contexts only exacerbates the situation since the word 'magic' is overloaded with negative connotations. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p25.25">All this makes it clear that English is not capable of handling the ancient distinctions in healing (when there are any). </s>
<s n="s2.5;p25.25">The choices of terms are either charged with negative connotations or evoke too modern a concept. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p25.25">Nevertheless, I think we can reasonably dispose of the terms 'irrational' and 'rational' altogether when discussing ancient healing. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p25.25">To conclude briefly, David's article employs unsuitable terminology, some of which is not found in other authors of the field. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p25.25">The distinct similarities between 'magical' cures within the Greek and Egyptian medical systems are not discussed and the distinctions between Egyptian healers are too pronounced and what is more contrary to the evidence. </s>
