<head>Figure 2.1, a cross section of an influenza particle <hi rend="sup">13</hi> . In brief, influenza is a roughly spherical particle with three main envelope proteins or glycoprotein spikes embedded asymmetrically in a host derived lipid envelope. Upon the inner surface of the envelope, Matrix protein or M1 coats the entire surface, stabilising the particle structure. Within the particle, RNP complex and NP proteins bind directly to the eight negative sense single stranded RNA genome segments forming helical structures. </head>

<figure id="BAWE_0127i-pic.002">
<head>Figure 2.2, the HA molecule <hi rend="sup">3</hi> . HA binds to sialic acid on the surface and following endocytosis, a pH decrease in the endosome occurs. This causes HA1 <hi rend="italic">N</hi> -terminus to be pulled out from the lipid envelope and bury itself into the endosomal membrane. This results in virus endosome fusion and release of the genome into the cytoplasm.</head>

<s n="s3.5;p10.52">Regular selection pressure from antibodies and the lack of proof reading ability in the viral RNA polymerase <hi rend="sup">4</hi> leads to an accumulation of sense mutations in the HA sequence which enable the virus to evade the immune response and infect susceptible hosts. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p10.52">This finding was confirmed by Knossow <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> in 1984 whose X-ray crystallography data illustrated that escape mutants have very small changes in HA structure. </s>

They were then tested in a HI assay by addition of 25µ l to 100µ l PBS and subsequent dilution of MAb2 1:2 across the plate. After incubation at room temperature for 1 hour, erythrocytes were added and 45 minute incubation was performed. It was observed from the HI assay that virus samples 2 and 3 had no end point and therefore were true double mutants. Virus sample 1 had a possible end point at the ½ dilution point.</head>
