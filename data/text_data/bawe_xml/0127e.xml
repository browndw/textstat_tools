<s n="s1.3;p36.69">For both BEV infected cell lines whether actinomycin D is present or absent, two peaks in RNA polymerase activity are apparent. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p36.69">The first peak at four hours is due to primary replication of the BEV. The lag time between initial infection and the peak at four hours is due to the need for RNA polymerase to be synthesized by BEV using host translational mechanisms such as ribosomes. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p36.69">The first peak is therefore smaller than the second peak, which is due to secondary replication of BEV genome; at ten hours as only initial BEV genomes will be present in the cells causing a higher percentage of RNA polymerase activity to be evident at ten hours. </s>
</p>
<p n="p37.69">
<s n="s1.2;p37.69">Both BEV infected cell samples also exhibit a decrease in RNA polymerase activity at six hours into the experiment. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p37.69">The results obtained for the RNA polymerase activity at six hours may be anomalous because as the experiment progresses, RNA polymerase activity is likely to increase rather then decrease as more BEV genome and polyproteins become available for replication. </s>
</p>
<p n="p38.69">
<s n="s1.6;p38.69">There are two possible reasons as to why this may have occurred. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p38.69">The first may be due to the how effective the BHK21 cells were at producing the BEV progeny. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p38.69">Usually, BEV production reaches a peak at around five hours into an experiment, yet figure 2 demonstrates that two cycles of genome replication and therefore two cycles of BEV growth are apparent during the time course of the experiment. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p38.69">As a high multiplicity of infection was used, all of the cells should have been infected initially and therefore only a single BEV growth cycle should be apparent. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p38.69">Therefore it is possible that some of the BHK21 cells were more efficient at replicating BEV genome than other BHK21 cells. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p38.69">Some BHK21 cells may have been able to replicate BEV more efficiently as they were perhaps about to divide themselves and therefore translation of proteins and abundance of nucleotides would be optimal and favor BEV replication. </s>
</p>
<p n="p39.69">
<s n="s1.3;p39.69">The second reason as to why a decrease in RNA polymerase activity occurs at six hours could be due to the technique used to obtain these results. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p39.69">During one phase of this experiment the cell extract was spotted onto Whatman No1 filter paper circles and then washed in trichloroacetic acid and ethanol. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p39.69">These discs were then incubated in order to dry them therefore if these discs were not completely dry when the final stage of this procedure was carried out, it is possible that some RNA polymerase may have been washed away leading to lower than expected results. </s>
</p>
<p n="p40.69">
<s n="s1.2;p40.69">From observing figure 2, there is a difference in the percentage activity of RNA polymerase between the BEV infected cells with actinomycin D present and those with actinomycin D absent. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p40.69">BEV infected cells with actinomycin D absent have a lower percentage RNA polymerase activity than the BEV infected cells with actinomycin D present. </s>
</p>
<p n="p41.69">
<s n="s1.3;p41.69">As actinomycin D does not inhibit the viral RNA polymerase there should theoretically be little difference between the percentage activity of RNA polymerase of both the BEV infected cell lines. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p41.69">However, because both BEV infected cell lines follow a similar trend of a peak of RNA polymerase activity at four and ten hours and a decrease at six hours a possible difference between the data sets may again be due too the efficiency of the cells at producing BEV. It may be possible that BHK21 cells infected with BEV and actinomycin D were more efficient at translation therefore producing more RNA polymerase causing the enzymes activity to be higher in this cell line the BEV infected cells where actinomycin D was absent. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p41.69">The cells which were infected with BEV alone may have required BEV to stimulate translation of mRNA molecules to a higher intensity which may have taken more time to achieve and as such accounting for the lag in RNA polymerase activity and sudden increase in RNA polymerase activity seen in BEV infected cells without actinomycin D over the time course of the experiment. </s>
</p>
<p n="p42.69">
<s n="s1.2;p42.69">Another possible reason for this occurrence may be due to the presence and absence of the actinomycin D. initially, the BEV infected cells with actinomycin D present have a higher percentage of RNA polymerase activity then the BEV infected cells with actinomycin D absent. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p42.69">It is therefore possible that the BEV infected cells where actinomycin D was present were inhibited at a faster rate, enabling the host cells energy and components to be directed towards BEV progeny synthesis and a faster and more effective rate, leading to the general higher levels of RNA polymerase activity in BEV infected cells with actinomycin D present. </s>

<s n="s2.2;p44.69">There may also be the beginnings of a third peak at fourteen hours although as no further data was collect this hypothesis cannot be confirmed. </s>
</p>
<p n="p45.69">
<s n="s1.1;p45.69">For data set B, there appears to be three peaks of intracellular viral RNA at four hours, seven hours and fourteen hours, which is very similar to the trend exhibited by data set A for BEV intracellular RNA. </s>
</p>
<p n="p46.69">
<s n="s1.3;p46.69">It is evident that BEV RNA increases during the experiment. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p46.69">The first peak at four hours for both data sets is possibly due to the synthesis of new RNA genomes as translation can occur directly from the BEV genome. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p46.69">The newly synthesized genomes can then in turn be used to translate polyprotein and replicate to produce more BEV genomes. </s>
</p>
<p n="p47.69">
<s n="s1.2;p47.69">The second peak at seven hours for data set B and eight hours for data set A signifies the second cycle of genome replication. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p47.69">The amount of intracellular viral RNA will be higher at the eight hour peak than the four hour peak as the primary replicated genomes can now be used as templates for further genome replication. </s>
</p>
<p n="p48.69">
<s n="s1.1;p48.69">A lag period is evident between both the primary genome replication event and the secondary genome replication event as proteins such as polyprotein C and the RNA polymerase enzyme need to be synthesized in order for replication to occur. </s>
</p>
<p n="p49.69">
<s n="s1.3;p49.69">A dramatic decrease in the intracellular viral RNA is present at roughly seven hours for both data sets and again between eight and ten hours for data set B. Such a decrease in viral RNA may be due to the degradation of the replicative intermediate molecule which is also RNA. New BEV genomes cannot be directly synthesized from genomic RNA as no enzyme exists in the host cell or the BEV genome which can perform such a reaction. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p49.69">Therefore a negative sense RNA molecule is synthesized and acts as a template so viral RNA polymerase may make more BEV genomes. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p49.69">As the negative sense RNA is only required for genome replication, it is degraded after sufficient genome replication has been completed, effectively leading to a decrease in intracellular viral RNA as shown by figure 4. </s>
</p>
<p n="p50.69">
<s n="s1.4;p50.69">The beginnings of a third peak for data set A at fourteen hours and the third peak at the same time period for data set B may be possibly due to a third cycle of genome replication, although if this were the case, the end point dilution for intracellular viral RNA should be higher as more BEV genomes would be available as templates for replication to occur. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p50.69">There are therefore two possible reasons why this trend has occurred. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p50.69">The first is that the third peak is indeed the beginnings of a third peak but as no further samples of intracellular viral RNA were taken from other time points it is unknown how the data for both sets would continue. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p50.69">Another possible reason is that different BHK21 cells were able to replicate the BEV genomes at a more efficient rate and the possible beginnings of a third genome replication cycle at fourteen hours may be due to the inefficient cells beginning a delayed cycle of genome replication. </s>
</p>
<p n="p51.69">
<s n="s1.3;p51.69">It is evident from observing figure 4 that intracellular viral RNA levels for data set B is, on average, higher than those for data set A. The cells sampled to provide data set B may have been more efficient at the replication of the BEV genome, possibly as some BHK21 cells infected with BEV were more efficient at translation. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p51.69">Therefore more RNA polymerase enzymes and polyproteins could be produced, enabling the replication intermediate of the genome to be produced at a higher efficiency hence causing intracellular viral RNA levels to increase. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p51.69">These cells may have also contained higher levels of nucleotides important for the replication of the genome enabling the process to occur more efficiently therefore producing more intracellular RNA at a faster rate. </s>

<s n="s2.2;p55.69">Both data sets show peaks in infectious virus at seven to eight hours at these time points and therefore BEV has successfully translated structural proteins to produce empty capsids and replicated its RNA genome enabling infectious progeny to be produced. </s>

<p n="p57.69">
<s n="s1.3;p57.69">I believe that the data value for eighteen hours for data set A is anomalous as it is unlikely that a high proportion of the BHK21 cells were so inefficient at producing BEV progeny that infectious virus levels peaked at eighteen hours. </s>

<s n="s3.3;p57.69">As such, a possible reason as to why this result is so high may be due to contamination from another virus causing the infectious virus levels to become very high or due to error in determining the TCID <hi rend="sub">50</hi> value which was open to individual interpretation and therefore subjected to miscalculation leading to a higher than expected result. </s>

<p n="p58.69">
<s n="s1.3;p58.69">As figures two and four have both shown secondary peaks for RNA polymerase activity and intracellular RNA respectively, a conclusion can be drawn that some of the BHK21 cells were better at producing virus. </s>
