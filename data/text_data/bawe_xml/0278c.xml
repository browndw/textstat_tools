<s n="s3.5;p1.11">The trademark, Levi's® and their very first product, 501 ® Original Jeans are well recognized around the world and is registered in more than 160 countries with its headquarters in North America, Europe and in Asia. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p1.11">As stated by Peter Drucker, "The purpose of a business is to create a satisfied customer"; in order to suceed in today's competitive marketplace the company must be customer-orientated, where they must be able to successfully recognize the needs and wants of the customers. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p2.11">The most succesful marketing strategy the Levi Strauss &amp; Co have adaopted would be promotion, the main factor which allowed the Levi Strauss &amp; Co to maintain its Brand leadership. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p2.11">Levi Strauss &amp; Co has a high promotion spending, especially on TV commercials, which are considered to be the main contributor in advertsement strategy. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p2.11">For example, the company put £5 million on an iconic TV advertisement showing "a group of young people twisting and contorting their limbs into strange positions"<ref target="BAWE_0278c-ftnote.004"/>, which led to a rise in the market share from 10.6% in 1999 to 11.1% in 2000. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p4.11">Once the Levi's® established its brand, the price of 501 ® Original Jeans became inelastic, where even though the price increased the demand fell only slightly since high price signified high quality. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p4.11">Also, as a leading brand, Levi's® worked to sustain its brand image successfully. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p4.11">For example it did not allow Tesco from selling 501 ® Original Jeans since it undermines its brand image. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p4.11">Instead, Levi Strauss &amp; Co introduced discounts Jeans with a brand called Signature, which is sold in Wal-Mart Store in America. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.11">
<s n="s1.2;p5.11">The fact that the Levi Strauss &amp; Co is able to establish and sustain its brand leadership and maintain high profit from selling 501 ® Original Jeans is also due to its successful tactics against the competitors by constantly "comparing its products, prices, channels of distribution and promotional methods"<ref target="BAWE_0278c-ftnote.006"/> to identify areas where it can gain a competitive advantage. </s>

<p n="p6.11">
<s n="s1.4;p6.11">Lees Jeans is one of the main rivals of the Levi's®, where both of them are associated with American west, designed and priced similarly. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p6.11">However, Levi's® has a higher market share, where perception of Levis being more "powerful and vivid"<ref target="BAWE_0278c-ftnote.007"/> led the consumers to choose Levi's® over Lees Jeans, especially teenagers and young adults, the main targets of the Levi's®. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p6.11">However, it could be stated that the advertisements are too iconic, where it only targets teenagers and young adults. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p6.11">Since signature is introduced in Wal-Mart, a common supermarket, advertisement would need to appeal to a broader base including people in their 30s and even 40s. </s>

<s n="s2.6;p7.11">An example of Levi's® focusing on the customer value is one to one marketing, where Levi's introduced personal pair system to design 501 ® Original Jeans according to individual customer's measurements. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p7.11">They use what is called, "the 'Original Spin' program, an in-store computerized kiosk to let the consumer select between specific models, fabric, leg openings, buttons and colors. </s>

<head>Brand Stretchability</head>
<p n="p8.11">
<s n="s1.6;p8.11">Levi's® did attempt to extend its brand by selling men suits under its name but it failed dramatically since Denim was perceived as "informal, denim association "<ref target="BAWE_0278c-ftnote.011"/>. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p8.11">This is also a failure in perceiving market opportunities where they failed to recognize the benefits consumers look for from the products. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p8.11">However, Levi's introduced Docker®, a very successful brand where for example, "Dockers® Khakis quickly became the No. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p8.11">1 khaki pant brand in the United States and still holds that leadership status today"<ref target="BAWE_0278c-ftnote.012"/>. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p8.11">Also, in march 2005, Levi's® entered into "a licensing relationship with GMI Europe to manufacture and sell men's and women's lifestyle footwear under the Levi's® brand name in the U.S., Canada and Latin America"<ref target="BAWE_0278c-ftnote.013"/>, which was based on the consumer appeal of the Levi's® brand footwear in Asia. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p8.11">However, there is always a risk of stretching its brand too much, where it might lose its core market and objective, which is producing fashionable and quality denim. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p9.11">Well-Segmented market is another factor, which allowed Levi's® to gain a competitive advantage over its competitors. </s>

<s n="s3.9;p10.11">Levi's® however focuses its market on teenagers and young adults as they have more disposable income and tend to be more in to the fashion. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p10.11">In order to get closer to the youth market, not only Levi's® produces iconic advertisements but also Levi's® introduced 'Antidote' with digital agency, Lateral. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p10.11">Antidote is an user-generated content, "a living, growing snapshot of what people are thinking and doing across Europe, which aim to "actively try to link different groups together with similar interests, or common themes"<ref target="BAWE_0278c-ftnote.014"/>. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p10.11">Even though this might help to promote Levi's® brand to the youth groups, the company should always focus on the effectiveness and quality of the site, where it is possible that it will undermine the brand. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p10.11">In regards to geographical factor, Levi Strauss &amp; Co has headquarters in North America, Europe and in Asia as "products do not always occupy the same stage in the life cycle between different countries"<ref target="BAWE_0278c-ftnote.015"/> and also the wants of the consumers can be distinctive in each area due to various factors such as climate and culture. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p10.11">For example, Jeans in America are in mature stage, where as it is in growth stage in eastern countries and Europe. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p10.11">Moreover, recently as the European market is falling down in the women's market including the profit made from 501 ® Original Jeans, Levi Strauss &amp; Co tries to focus on its premium repositioning. </s>
