<p n="p15.30">
<s n="s1.3;p15.30">The text seems not to show abstract clearly as it is neither having title nor exactly summarising the story however 'well', the beginning of the sentence can be considered as a signal that the narrative is about to commence. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p15.30">Furthermore the following sentence, 'Gabriel who's... the point' can be abstract as it is showing a main fact which is about relationship between Gabriel and rugger bugger type man. </s>

<p n="p16.30">
<s n="s1.3;p16.30">Orientation seems to start from 'Gabriel who's ... in line one to the end of the first paragraph, ... rugger bugger type' or can be the first sentence of the second paragraph, 'so eight pints later... like this'. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p16.30">Although the beginning sentence of orientation might be also abstract it includes information about main characters, Gabriel and the bloke. </s>

</p>
<p n="p23.30">
<s n="s1.8;p23.30">From the Descriptive perspective firstly the frame of the text is structured with main headline, main text with several sub-headlines, illustrations drawn next to some paragraphs, an information box with an illustration, the following information box at the end. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p23.30">The text is overall looked as texts divided in each small paragraph. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p23.30">It is also a portrait text separated into left and right parts in the middle. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p23.30">In addition the topic is being presented in a fairly informal way with plain words. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p23.30">It is also written rather persuasively and comically for example it says '<hi rend="italic">Ronald lies to children'</hi> . </s>
<s n="s6.8;p23.30">It is also possibly overstating in sub-headlines such as '<hi rend="italic">killing animals'</hi> or '<hi rend="italic">harming your health'</hi>. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p23.30">The preferred reading is to show various negative aspects of Ronald McDonald and to spread these ideas throughout society. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p23.30">Finally the ideal reader of the text are children who love fast foods such as McDonalds, their parents, people who criticise McDonalds food industry and agree with ideas on the text and people who have not known facts in the text before. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p24.30">Next social values are interpreted based on discourse features of the text from the following four points which are image, vocabulary, grammar and genre. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p24.30">Firstly the text of image is well organised visually by using several illustrations. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p24.30">The text uses slightly large formats overall while rather small formats are used in information boxes. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p24.30">In addition addressed of publishers at the end is a good example of REAL position. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p24.30">The combination of visual and written modes encourages people to look at the text more. </s>
</p>
<p n="p25.30">
<s n="s1.9;p25.30">The text includes numerous negative vocabularies such as <hi rend="italic">damaging, killing or harming</hi> from the sub-headlines. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p25.30">It also uses plain words instead of academic words. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p25.30">It can be seen some lexical cohesion. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p25.30">As an example of elegant repetition <hi rend="italic">natural forests</hi> in the main text implies <hi rend="italic">the earth</hi> in the sub-headline. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p25.30">In an information box on the middle of the right side, clown refers to Ronald as synonyms in the context. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p25.30">In addition a sentence, 'DON'T BE TRICKED BY THE 'CLOWN'!' is considered a strong statement of the writer as it is written with capital letters and inverted commas. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p25.30">The effect of negative vocabularies choice encourages pessimistic image of Ronald McDonald. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p25.30">Overall the text tries to avoid becoming a boring text while using lexical cohesion. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p25.30">At the same time it enables to attract reader's interests more. </s>
</p>
<p n="p26.30">
<s n="s1.8;p26.30">Throughout the text present tense is used while modal verbs cannot be seen. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p26.30">As effects it is interpreted that these features emphasise the absolute truth statement. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p26.30">It often includes passive constructions for example <hi rend="italic">'natural forests are cut down for space...'</hi> </s>
<s n="s4.8;p26.30">or '<hi rend="italic">millions of chickens, cows and pigs are cruelly imprisoned...'.</hi> </s>
<s n="s5.8;p26.30">The effect is that Ronald is predominantly foregrounded as it says <hi rend="italic">Ronald</hi> diagonally on the left top corner in each paragraph. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p26.30">The agent also has a greater thematic role throughout the text. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p26.30">In addition sub-headlines uses nominalisation such as '<hi rend="italic">harming your health</hi>' or '<hi rend="italic">robbing the poor</hi>'. </s>

<p n="p27.30">
<s n="s1.1;p27.30">The text is a categorised genre as not only notice that McDonald has numerous negative points but also advertisement about statements by a NETWORK FOR KIDS AGAINST MCDONALD'S. Therefore the text provides advertising text style such as precise syntaxes and idioms while it is a type of notice as the mixing of genres. </s>

<p n="p28.30">
<s n="s1.8;p28.30">The third interpretation is associated with social context in the text. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p28.30">The text is a part of the following social frameworks, environments, business, employments, health, foods, family and education. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p28.30">We need to have acquired some social knowledge as follows in order to understand these social frameworks. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p28.30">Junk foods do not provide better nutrition while the fast food industry spread all over the world. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p28.30">People cannot help going to McDonalds because of its convenience, reasonable prices and friendly homey atmosphere in the place. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p28.30">Children would rather eat fast foods than vegetables because of the taste. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p28.30">A number of big companies in the world including McDonalds gains cheap lands or ingredients from developing countries and damage the environments. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p28.30">The industry is still strong position in the business world while having huge criticism. </s>
</p>
<p n="p29.30">
<s n="s1.7;p29.30">Finally deconstructive interpretation of the text is discussed. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p29.30">The text seems to be concluded with contradiction for the preferred reading. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p29.30">The text says <hi rend="italic">'It's up to us to think for ourselves and to get together to make the world a better place'</hi> at the end of the information box. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p29.30">It is fairly clear that the text shows terrible criticisms for the McDonalds business and social drawbacks by the industry overall. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p29.30">However the sentence basically says that we should establish better society by <hi rend="italic">ourselves</hi> which should include everyone including writers of the text and employees for McDonalds. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p29.30">Here it seems to be a contradiction because the text is supposed to be in an opposite position from the McDonalds industry however it also suggests cooperation with the enemy, McDonalds at the same time. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p29.30">Therefore it seems somehow to undermine the preferred reading. </s>
</p>
<p n="p30.30">
<s n="s1.3;p30.30">To sum up CDA is a way to consider social situation while analysing texts. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p30.30">It makes me realise that texts are strongly associated with social and institutional contexts within society. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p30.30">Therefore CDA enables readers to provide deep understanding and some questions about social ethics by finding contradictions in texts. </s>
