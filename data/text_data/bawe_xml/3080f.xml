<s n="s2.15;p2.6">When read in relation to the New Historicist theory as stated by Stephen Greenblatt in <hi rend="italic">The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism</hi> (pg 2251) it can be said that this poem 'should be restored to the past in order to make it count in the present;' that in order to fully grasp the significance of this work of literature, it should be examined in the light of the social and political climate in which it was written<ref target="BAWE_3080f-ftnote.004"/>. </s>

<ref target="BAWE_3080f-ftnote.005"/>
<s n="s5.15;p2.6">Although this is a poem written during the Elizabethan era, the first stirrings of this 'spirited upheaval' are being felt, such as the Essex rising as mentioned in Greenblatt's essay. </s>
<s n="s6.15;p2.6">Therefore by writing of a queen who is 'attended' by the 'Graces' (Love and Virtue) Raleigh is engaging in a dialogue of flattery with the Queen and firmly asserting his loyalty to her.<ref target="BAWE_3080f-ftnote.006"/> Most 'of Raleigh's poems were intimately linked with his place in the court and in particular, with his fantastic courtship with the Queen' and this one is no exception<ref target="BAWE_3080f-ftnote.007"/>. </s>
<s n="s7.15;p2.6">By focusing on the 'historicity of the text and the textuality of history' we can see that this poem is both fostered by the prevailing cult of the 'Fairy Queen' that surrounded Elizabeth I and is generating such an image<ref target="BAWE_3080f-ftnote.008"/>. </s>
<s n="s8.15;p2.6">Indeed, it is an example of how 'life and literature stimulate and play upon each other." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3080f-ftnote.009"/>
<s n="s9.15;p2.6">New Historicism hopes to find 'through historical research, a stable core of meaning within the text." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3080f-ftnote.010"/>
<s n="s10.15;p2.6">In this case it is possible to guess at the intention of the poet if we take into account the volatile politics of the Elizabethan era, and the importance that the Queen herself placed on fostering the 'ideal of perfection to which she was wedded at the moment of her consecration." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3080f-ftnote.011"/>
<s n="s11.15;p2.6">Raleigh himself stated 'Now we have a Present made,' in reference to his poetic dramatization, strengthening the idea that literature shapes history just as it is shaped by history<ref target="BAWE_3080f-ftnote.012"/>. </s>
<s n="s12.15;p2.6">It is fair to suggest that in doing so, 'drama is holding a mirror up to nature,' not only reflecting the image of 'nature' but reflecting <hi rend="italic">onto</hi> it. </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3080f-ftnote.013"/>
<s n="s13.15;p2.6">Through the poetry and propaganda during Elizabeth I's reign, such as that seen in the works of Raleigh and Edmund Spenser who also wrote of a 'fairy Queene,' 'Elizabeth is transformed almost completely beyond human personality, appearing as an image of static timeless perfection." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3080f-ftnote.014"/>
<s n="s14.15;p2.6">This was an important political tool at a time when few members of the population would ever actually see the Queen, and therefore her hold on her subjects had to be maintained through rumour and public image. </s>
<s n="s15.15;p2.6">Therefore the 'most excellent and glorious person of our soveraine the Queene, and her kingdome in Faery Land' written of by Spencer, Raleigh and their contemporaries played a key role in creating this mystifying and eternal image of the Virgin Queen. <ref target="BAWE_3080f-ftnote.015"/> </s>
