<s n="s5.6;p1.37">Since its demerger from Six Continents (formerly Bass Plc) in 2003, IHG has been focusing on transforming itself from a hotel owner into a hotel management and franchise company. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p1.37">At present, the Group aims to expand its hotel business in the mainland China. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.37">
<s n="s1.6;p2.37">At the end of 2004, the Group operating profit has increased by 17% than the prior year. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p2.37">The Group has a higher gearing level yet it is more or less than its key competitors within the UK hospitality industry. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p2.37">IHG is one of the FTSE 100 index companies. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p2.37">As at 31 October 2004, the P/E ratio of the Group is 18.6, much higher than the industry average and its key competitors. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p2.37">Although there is no great difference of the share value of IHG at the same date one year after, the Group has a desirable stock market valuation. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p2.37">IHG even has a better performance than the competitors and has outperformed the FTSE 100 index during the past 6 months. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.37">
<s n="s1.4;p3.37">Various brokers express optimistic estimations for the future business of IHG and recommend investors to buy its shares. </s>

<s n="s4.4;p3.37">Its good corporate image and the match of the hotel operations to meet the mainland Chinese needs suggest that the IHG could gain lucrative returns from the Chinese market. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.37">
<s n="s1.1;p4.37">Together with the positive prospects of the future of global hospitality industry, all these suggest that there is room for market capitalisation growth of IHG. In light of this, it is recommended that buying IHG shares at current market price is a good decision before its future rise as a result of higher demand. </s>

<s n="s3.3;p5.37">In April 2003, Six Continents Plc separated into two groups, IHG comprising the hotel operations worldwide with the controlling stake of Britvic (the UK's second largest soft drinks manufacturer), and Mitchells and Butlers PLC (MAB) comprising the retail business (ihgplc.com). </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.37">

<s n="s2.8;p7.37">This is supported by Holmes et al (2005), with the notion that an annual financial report of a company is the principal way for different stakeholders to understand the activities, progress and future plans of that company. </s>

<s n="s5.8;p7.37">They also assist the comparison against competitors and averages within the industry (Atrill and McLaney, 2002). </s>
<s n="s6.8;p7.37">According to Mintel (2004), IHG's major competitors in the UK hospitality sector are the Hilton Group Plc (HG) and the Whitbread Plc (WTB); therefore they are used to evaluate IHG's market position in the industry. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p7.37">Other main competitors, including Millennium &amp; Copthorne Hotels Plc, De Vere Group Plc, and CHE Hotel Group Plc are also used to obtain the industry averages of different aspects of business performance. </s>

<p n="p8.37">
<s n="s1.6;p8.37">Despite the general limitations when utilising financial statements to evaluate the wealth a business (Atrill and McLaney, 2002), it is important to note that there are additional limitations of IHG financial statements. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p8.37">Firstly, IHG has changed its financial year end from 30 September to 31 December since 2003 as a consequence of the period covered by its financial statements (i.e. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p8.37">P&amp;L account, cash flow statement) is 12 months ended 31 December 2004, while 15 months ended 31 December 2003. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p8.37">Secondly, the performance of MAB before the separation is also included in the financial statements of 2003 which represents 20% of the total revenue (IHG Annual Report, 2004, pp 38). </s>
<s n="s5.6;p8.37">Averages of 2003 figures are taken to a basis of 12 months in this report, yet it is believed that there are deviations with the true view of the Group performance. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p8.37">To gain a better comparison, the unaudited 2003 P &amp; L account, which is on a 12 months basis with the exclusion of MAB business is therefore used. </s>

<s n="s2.5;p11.37">As illustrated in Table 3 and Table 4, IHG's overall profitability in 2004 has increased following the hotel industry recovery from the impact of global insecurity and SARS (WTO, 2005d). </s>
<s n="s3.5;p11.37">Regardless the decrease of turnover in Americas and only a slight growth in total hotel revenue, together with declined operating profit of the soft drink business, the increased managed and franchise hotel business of the Group gain benefits of reduction in cost of sales as a result of higher gross profit margin and a significant increase in total operating income with 17%. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p11.37">The hotel businesses across the three geographical sectors, particularly in EMEA and Asia Pacific region show improvements as a result of 25.5% growth in operating profit. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p11.37">The overall RevPAR has also increased by 2.4% to £4126m. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.37">
<s n="s1.3;p12.37">The rise in net profit margin indicates that IHG has efficiently controlled the costs (i.e. operating, administrative, distribution) in the generation of revenue from sales. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p12.37">Moreover, a higher turnover is generated despite the 10.7% decline in total capital invested in 2004 showing that there are improvements in the Group's productive efficiency. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p12.37">All these cost control and productive efficiencies result to an increase in net profit available to ordinary shareholders. </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.37">
<s n="s1.3;p13.37">Externally, IHG shows a better profitability performance than both key competitors and industry average. </s>

<s n="s3.9;p15.37">This is attributed to the share capital restructuring of IHG by two consecutive share repurchase programmes during the year (IHG Annual Report, 2004, note 30). </s>
<s n="s4.9;p15.37">The considerable increase in earnings (51%) and the effect of repurchase programmes lead to a better outcome on the return of profit available to ordinary shareholders. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p15.37">The share capital consolidation with new share nominal value of 112p further reduces the number of ordinary shares from 739m to 622m at the end of the fiscal year, and consequently, a higher earning per share occurs. </s>

<s n="s3.3;p17.37">The declined and relatively low current and acid test ratios suggest a worsening liquidity position for IHG. The more reliable ratio of operating cash flows to maturing obligations reveals that the working capital is not effectively managed by the Group and there might be problems for IHG to cover its short term financial obligations (Atrill and McLaney, 2002). </s>

<s n="s4.9;p24.37">For instance, the total hotels turnover has only increased by 0.7% than the prior year. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p24.37">The growth of hotels operating profit has also been generalised to the contributions of the three regions mentioned in the Chairman's review. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p24.37">The fact is that the trading in Americas has just improved slightly with 1.2% growth in operating profit. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p24.37">Besides, its weakening liquidity situation is not declared that a net cash outflow of £338m is occurred after the payment for special dividends. </s>

<head rend="underlined bold">3.2 Political Factors</head>
<p n="p26.37">
<s n="s1.6;p26.37">Firstly, the hospitality industry is exposed to the threats of terrorism with the latest incident occurred last month in Amman, the capital of Jordan where 3 hotels were bombed (CatererSearch.com, 2005). </s>
<s n="s2.6;p26.37">Although the increasing trend of global tourism suggests that terrorism has little impact on people confidence to travel around, it is only limited to those unaffected destinations (World Tourism Organisation (WTO), 2005a). </s>
<s n="s3.6;p26.37">According to PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC, 2005), the slowdown of UK economy together with the bomb attacks in London have adversely affected UK hotel businesses. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p26.37">While PWC (2005) claims that the impact of attacks will be short-lived with little effect on hotel performance outside the capital, more recently, the UK police commissioner warns that the country is still being a top target for terrorists (BBCnews, 2005a). </s>
<s n="s5.6;p26.37">Certainly it would further generate a significant influence on tourist confidence travelling to the UK. Furthermore, companies are facing with increased insurance premiums as a result of terrorism (BBCnews, 2005b,c). </s>
<s n="s6.6;p26.37">IHG might be unable to cover the cost of insuring its business and employees in case of terrorist attacks. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p27.37">The labour-intensive nature of hotel business is also affected by the UK legislations in relation to increased minimum wage and pensions contributions (hospitalitynet, 2004). </s>
<s n="s2.3;p27.37">Total payroll cost per available room has raised (hospitalitynet, 2005a) and the government has announced its initiatives to further raise the minimum wage (BBCnews, 2005d). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p27.37">Besides, IHG has a pension deficit of £172m in 2004 (IHG Annual Report, 2004), it could be suggested that its profitability might be threatened by the increased pension funds. </s>

<p n="p28.37">
<s n="s1.3;p28.37">Climate change and epidemic pose serious impact on hospitality businesses (WTO, 2005b,c). </s>
<s n="s2.3;p28.37">This is revealed by the previous incidents of SARS, Indian Ocean seaquake, tsunami and Hurricanes Katrina and Rita (WTO, 2005a). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p28.37">With increasing concerns of the widespread avian flu epidemic in Europe nowadays, it is blamed that the over-reaction by the media would create unnecessary panic to people and hence discourage international tourism (WTO, 2005c). </s>
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="underlined bold">3.5 Economic factors</head>
<p n="p29.37">
<s n="s1.3;p29.37">Despite the adverse effects of hurricanes and raising oil price, US has reported economic recovery with 4.3% annual growth rate (BBCnews, 2005e). </s>
<s n="s2.3;p29.37">Regarding the hospitality sector, besides the positive results of US tourism for the year 2004 as reported by the WTO (WTO, 2005d), the Smith Travel Research (hospitalitynet, 2005b) estimates that there will be growing demand of hotel rooms with 8.1% increase for RevPAR in the US lodging industry in 2005. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p29.37">Certainly, IHG would be benefited from it since its number of hotels in the Americas amounted to 79% of the total hotel system (Table 13). </s>
</p>
<p n="p30.37">
<s n="s1.2;p30.37">Yet the high oil prices do not discourage tourism demand at present (WTO, 2005e), the revenue of IHG would be hindered from high cost of sales. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p30.37">Fluctuation in currency exchange rates between the UK sterling and other currencies, particularly the US dollar and Euro would affect also the Group's profit, net asset and interest cover. </s>

<head rend="underlined bold">3.6 Social Factors</head>
<p n="p31.37">

<s n="s2.5;p31.37">However, there will be changes in travel destinations as shown in Figure 1, with growing popularity of East Asia and the Pacific while reverse for Europe and Americas. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p31.37">People are more affluent nowadays which has encouraged more leisure travel (WTO, 2005d; Mintel, 2004). </s>
<s n="s4.5;p31.37">There is also strong growth for mainland Chinese tourism and the Chinese are regarded as one of the top tourism spenders (WTO, 2005d). </s>
<s n="s5.5;p31.37">Since most Chinese travellers are more likely to choose mid-priced accommodation (Mok and Defranco, 1999), the Holiday Inn brands of IHG which focus on serving the mid-scale market would gain competitive advantages. </s>

<head rend="underlined bold">3.7 Technological Factors</head>
<p n="p32.37">
<s n="s1.4;p32.37">With the wide exposure of information technology around the world, people pursuing nowadays are high speed internet access and a variety of entertainment technologies such as videophones (BBCnews, 2005f). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p32.37">This has generated on-line booking trends and growing demand of entertainment technologies in hotels (CatererSearch.com, 2005). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p32.37">On the other hand, driven by the increasing usage of cellular mobile with prediction of two billion users by the end of 2005, it is reported that there is continual decline in hotel telecom revenues (hospitalitynet, 2005a). </s>

<s n="s3.3;p36.37">The announcement from HG with its initiative to reunify with the US Hilton Hotels Corporation (HHC) on 14 Oct 2005 (Birmingham Post, 2005) lead to expansion in both share price and volume of IHG (Cranage, 2005), while there is decline on 25 Oct as a result of the negative news from the WTB (EveningStandard, 2005). </s>

<s n="s1.6;p37.37">Various brokers express optimistic estimations for the future business of IHG and recommend investors to buy its shares (DigitalLook, 2005; Thomson, 2005; YahooFinance, 2005). </s>
<s n="s2.6;p37.37">Although past performance shows that there is a decreasing trend of the Group revenue (ThomsonOneBanker, 2005), the fact is that the business of MAB was also included before the separation. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p37.37">Therefore, it could not provide a full picture of the performance of IHG. Rather, the Group reports 8.1% growth of RevPAR in the first half of 2005 (Turner, 2005) and positive cash flow (IHG interim report, 2005). </s>
<s n="s4.6;p37.37">Besides, it has successfully finished almost of its disposal programme (Garrahan, 2005) and gain management and franchise agreements (ihgplc.com). </s>
<s n="s5.6;p37.37">Its good corporate image and the match to meet the mainland Chinese needs suggest that the Group could achieve its aim of gaining lucrative returns from the Chinese market. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p37.37">Furthermore, the floatation of the Group's 47.5% stake of Britvic (SundayBusiness, 2005), the adverse impact of the completion deal of HG with HHC, the rumours of possible bid from Starwood (Saigol, 2005), together with the positive prospects of the future of the global hospitality industry, all these imply that there is room for market capitalisation growth of IHG. In light of this, it is suggested that buying IHG shares at current market price is a good decision before its future rise as a result of higher demand. </s>
