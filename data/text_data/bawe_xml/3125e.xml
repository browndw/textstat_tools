<p n="p1.12">
<s n="s1.8;p1.12">In this essay it will firstly introduce why language acquisition by apes is interesting to psycholinguistic research and for me personally. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p1.12">It will then look at two specific questions from the topic area. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p1.12">The first question is whether apes are capable to acquire and use language. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p1.12">It will be examined while discussing experiments of two chimps, Washoe and Kanzi. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p1.12">The second question is why humans are capable to acquire and use language. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p1.12">It will be considered with two main views by Piaget and Chomsky. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p1.12">Finally this essay will be concluded by evaluating how my reading has provided an answer towards these questions. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p1.12">There is also a further question arising at the end. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.12">
<s n="s1.8;p2.12">It is assumed that language acquisition and the use by non human primates is one of most interesting topic in psycholinguistic research. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p2.12">According to Harley (2001) the study of psycholinguistics is concerned with understanding, producing and remembering language. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p2.12">It seems that the topic is in particular related to understanding language since it is required to analyse the nature of language. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p2.12">Moreover while looking at language use by apes it leads to a further consideration on language acquisition by human beings. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p2.12">In addition this topic is interesting for me personally to find out if humans have any chances to communicate with other primates through human language system. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p2.12">As it was discussed in the class animal communication is different from humans. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p2.12">However communication with other primates will be possible when they have achieved acquisition of human language. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p2.12">In order to investigate the possibility the topic needs to be examined. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.12">
<s n="s1.8;p3.12">In addition there are particularly two questions which are interesting and most relevant to psycholinguistic research in this topic area. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p3.12">The first question is whether apes are capable to acquire and use language at equivalent level to humans. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p3.12">It is said that apes such as chimpanzees are cognitively intelligent to have a rich communication system in the wild (Harley, 2001). </s>
<s n="s4.8;p3.12">Furthermore a chimp called Sarah had achieved as high cognitive abilities as humans at the similar age. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p3.12">She recognised that it is not necessary to change the amount of water when pouring it from a tall, thin glass into a short, fat glass (Harley, 2001). </s>
<s n="s6.8;p3.12">However as it was discussed in the class it has been claimed that vocal tracts of apes are not structured to produce speech (Harley, 2001; Steinberg et al, 2001). </s>
<s n="s7.8;p3.12">Therefore language here does not necessarily mean spoken language. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p3.12">However it involves with both semantic associations among words and syntactic rules in sentences as Harley (2001) regards them as essential features of human language. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.12">
<s n="s1.8;p4.12">While a number of experiments have been attempted with various apes such as chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutuns the most famous and successful representatives are the cases of Washoe and Kanzi. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p4.12">Washoe, a chimpanzee had started to learn American Sign Language (ASL) when she was at approximately one year old (Harley, 2001). </s>
<s n="s3.8;p4.12">ASL is standard sign language widely used for people with hearing impairment in North America. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p4.12">It has words and syntax as all spoken languages do (Harley, 2001). </s>
<s n="s5.8;p4.12">While she was taught eating habits, toilet training and other social activities as a human child she had achieved some linguistic acquisition (Harley, 2001). </s>
<s n="s6.8;p4.12">For example she showed remarkable success on creativity of new signs. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p4.12">In other words she was able to invent a new word such as <hi rend="italic">waterbird</hi> for an object she had not learnt before. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p4.12">The word which refers to swan is created by combining previously learned two words, <hi rend="italic">water</hi> and <hi rend="italic">bird</hi> (Carroll, 1999). </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.12">
<s n="s1.11;p5.12">On the other hand most researchers have concluded that Washoe had only achieved rudimentary syntax and word order. </s>
<s n="s2.11;p5.12">Although she was able to combine words up to five items there is not enough evidence if they are syntactically structured (Harley, 2001; Steinberg et al, 2001). </s>
<s n="s3.11;p5.12">For example she was likely to say <hi rend="italic">sweet go</hi> although it is supposed to be <hi rend="italic">go sweet</hi> in the correct order (Aitchison, 1998). </s>
<s n="s4.11;p5.12">In addition Harley (2001) argues that Washoe's creativity is not certainly proved. </s>
<s n="s5.11;p5.12">For example waterbird can be produced by accident on the day of training randomly making signs such as 'water shoe' or 'water banana' (Harley, 2001). </s>
<s n="s6.11;p5.12">Furthermore Washoe's vocabulary size is not comparable to the one by human children. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p5.12">While normal children reach to approximately 14,000 words by 72 months Washoe only learned 130 sign words in four years (Carroll, 1999, Steinberg et al, 2001). </s>
<s n="s8.11;p5.12">Furthermore how Washoe's linguistic skills are measured is controversial. </s>
<s n="s9.11;p5.12">Since she had been trained by certain staffs they might have understood her language better. </s>
<s n="s10.11;p5.12">Therefore they might misunderstand her gestures as sign language or had over-interpretation what she had produced. </s>
<s n="s11.11;p5.12">According to Harley (2001) deaf native signers claimed that there is a significant discrepancy between the understanding by trainers and their views. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.12">
<s n="s1.11;p6.12">However it is said that another chimp, Kanzi had achieved much successful linguistic abilities. </s>
<s n="s2.11;p6.12">He is a pygmy chimpanzee while Washoe is a common chimpanzee. </s>
<s n="s3.11;p6.12">Bonobos are generally more intelligent and much suitable for social life and communicative behaviours than other apes (Harley, 2001). </s>
<s n="s4.11;p6.12">Kanzi's linguistic skills are measured with a keyboard. </s>
<s n="s5.11;p6.12">In other words when he touched it synthesised English speech in reference to objects, actions or locations was produced. </s>
<s n="s6.11;p6.12">The visual symbols shown on the keyboard were arbitrary geometrical while each matches a particular word (Steinberg et al, 2001). </s>
<s n="s7.11;p6.12">Firstly Kanzi was remarkable as he started to use keyboards spontaneously without explicit training (Aitchison, 1998). </s>
<s n="s8.11;p6.12">This shows Kanzi's high knowledge since Washoe was required explicit training associating a particular symbol and word in a context (Harley, 2001). </s>
<s n="s9.11;p6.12">Moreover 80 % of his output was spontaneous utterances (Harley, 2001). </s>
<s n="s10.11;p6.12">It is also found that Kanzi had demonstrated a great achievement on fixed word order. </s>
<s n="s11.11;p6.12">For example he was able to put the action before the object such as 'hide peanut' or 'bite tomato' (Aitchison, 1998). </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.12">
<s n="s1.8;p7.12">It is certainly acceptable that he shows high linguistic abilities. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p7.12">On the other hand some of Kanzi's abilities have been questioned among researchers. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p7.12">Although he is said to distinguish verb meanings between <hi rend="italic">get</hi> and <hi rend="italic">take</hi> (Harley, 2001) his semantic understanding is not equivalent to humans. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p7.12">For example Kanzi had used a word, 'strawberry' to refer to multiple purposes such as the object, going the field and requesting to eat it which humans do not (Harley, 2001). </s>
<s n="s5.8;p7.12">In addition it has been claimed that his syntactic knowledge is slow to grow and does not go over the equivalent level of human children at age of three (Harley, 2001). </s>
<s n="s6.8;p7.12">In addition it is questionable that other bonobos experiments have not been reported until recently as it has been past over 20 years since Kanzi's date had gathered in 1980s. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p7.12">Furthermore Steinberg et al (2001, pp155) states 'why Kanzi's younger sister, Mulika has yet to achieve results equal to those of Kanzi'. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p7.12">These points might suggest that high linguistic abilities are limited to Kanzi. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.12">
<s n="s1.13;p8.12">With two chimps' research it is considered that apes are not capable to acquire and use language at the similar level to humans. </s>
<s n="s2.13;p8.12">In order to understand language further it is necessary to investigate why humans are capable to acquire and use language while all other apes cannot. </s>
<s n="s3.13;p8.12">There are mainly two views to discuss the question. </s>
<s n="s4.13;p8.12">According to Steinberg et al (2001) pro-intelligence theorists such as Piaget argue that humans have certain aspects of intelligence which is required for language acquisition. </s>
<s n="s5.13;p8.12">In this theory intelligence does not mean knowledge but rather refers to means for acquiring knowledge. </s>
<s n="s6.13;p8.12">They believe that humans acquire language while learning or understanding intelligence from actions and experiences (Steinberg et al, 2001). </s>
<s n="s7.13;p8.12">Piaget has demonstrated the argument with four stages of cognitive development. </s>
<s n="s8.13;p8.12">For instance the first, sensorimotor stage gives infants before age of two a chance to attain knowledge that objects have continuous existence after it disappears from their views. </s>
<s n="s9.13;p8.12">Piaget states this learning enables infants to associate objects and its name in his cognition hypothesis (Harley, 2001). </s>
<s n="s10.13;p8.12">The hypothesis says that language necessarily develops by increasing cognitive skills such as perceptual processes (Harley, 2001). </s>
<s n="s11.13;p8.12">Therefore it is assumed that linguistic acquisition is universally relative to cognitive development. </s>
<s n="s12.13;p8.12">However it has been claimed that the idea does not apply to children with disorder such as Down's syndrome. </s>
<s n="s13.13;p8.12">In other words some children with the syndrome have achieved full competence in their language while most do not (Harley, 2001). </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.12">
<s n="s1.7;p9.12">Moreover it is assumed that hearing-impaired children who are more likely to be disadvantaged for cognitive development should delay in linguistic acquisition than those who are not. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p9.12">However research shows there are not huge differences in language acquisition although one learns spoken language and others acquire sign language (Harley, 2001). </s>
<s n="s3.7;p9.12">Therefore it is less evident to conclude that the hypothesis is true. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p9.12">In addition human infants from seven up to twelve years old in third stage of cognitive development recognise amount of water is same between a short wide glass and a tall thin glass (Harley, 2001). </s>
<s n="s5.7;p9.12">It is also proved that a chimp called Sarah had the cognitive ability as it states above. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p9.12">However it is researched that she would not achieve the same linguistic ability as human children age of twelve. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p9.12">Therefore the idea is limited in explaining the question with these objections. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.12">
<s n="s1.11;p10.12">Another explanation towards language capability by humans is brought by innatists like Chomsky. </s>
<s n="s2.11;p10.12">They approach the question as they are born with basic ideas of grammar called Universal Grammar (UG). </s>
<s n="s3.11;p10.12">It applies to every language in the world as it is essential basis in grammar of all languages. </s>
<s n="s4.11;p10.12">Humans begin to acquire a particular language with UG when they receive certain speech input from the world (Steinberg et al, 2001). </s>
<s n="s5.11;p10.12">A good example is Pidgin and Creole language. </s>
<s n="s6.11;p10.12">The former has been developed while trying to communicate with different language speakers originally between slavery. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p10.12">The latter has been grown as a native tongue between children of pidgin speakers. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p10.12">Although Pidgin language has fairly simplified syntax Creole language is syntactically rich (Harley, 2001). </s>
<s n="s9.11;p10.12">It is explained that it happens as all humans have basic syntactic ideas in UG. Chomsky also argues that language acquisition is nothing to do with intelligence. </s>
<s n="s10.11;p10.12">Therefore apes are not capable to acquire language at satisfactory level although they have achieved certain intelligence (Steinberg et al, 2001). </s>
<s n="s11.11;p10.12">On the other hand it is less evident to determine the view since it might result from limitation in apes' intelligence or lack of analytical skills (Steinberg et al, 2001). </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.12">
<s n="s1.8;p11.12">In addition Harley (2001) points out why language development is slow and causes full of errors when we have an innate ability to acquire it. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p11.12">Moreover it is controversial that socially isolated children were not able to achieve more than rudimentary syntax. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p11.12">According to Bickerton (1990) Genie had understood the rule of past tense but had a difficulty in the actual use. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p11.12">Chelsea also created unusual sentences such as '<hi rend="italic">The woman is bus the going</hi>' (Aitchison, 1998). </s>
<s n="s5.8;p11.12">Therefore Chomsky's UG does not apply to those who received speech input later than usual. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p11.12">It is also found that the approach focuses on only syntactic acquisition. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p11.12">However as it states at the beginning semantics between words is another important element while considering language acquisition. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p11.12">Therefore it is a fairly limited view to answer the question. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.12">
<s n="s1.7;p12.12">To sum up it is found that apes are not capable to acquire and use language at the equivalent level to humans from my reading. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p12.12">However this does not include fairly recent research and ongoing experiments with bonobo which is said to bring positive findings on the question. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p12.12">Therefore it is assumed that my reading has reasonably provided the answer with past research but not in current experiments. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p12.12">In addition my reading suggests a number of views by different researchers towards the second question. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p12.12">However it seems that all ideas lack explanations in some aspects or bring contradictions. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p12.12">Therefore it is not possible to give an exact answer. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p12.12">Finally it would be interesting to look at if there are any indicators to differentiate human from other primates in language capability through evolutional processes. </s>
