<s n="s3.4;p1.34">Despite the narrower operational scope, the mission of Greenpeace UK is consistent with that of the parent organization, with emphasis on "...non-violent, creative confrontation to expose global environmental problems, and force solutions for a green and peaceful future..." with the core aim "...to ensure the ability of the Earth to nurture life in all its diversity." </s>

<s n="s1.2;p2.34">In general, the web site itself is an outreach device that aims to promote and advance its cause to different audience with diverse interests. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p2.34">Not only are regular "news" updates to key campaigns posted, visuals are also available for download and circulation, supporters can be recruited, letter campaigns organized and documents archived and searched, daily diaries are posted by activists to share their experiences of major events with their international audience in a very personalized way. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.34">
<s n="s1.2;p3.34">Specifically, the web site showcases an extent of issues and provides diverse information with specific aims. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p3.34">On the welcome page, there is a general overview of the main features of the site and the introductory links stream you towards the direction you may be heading for. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.34">
<s n="s1.4;p4.34">The web site is segmented into a few core sections. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p4.34">Firstly, there is a section titled "About Greenpeace" which consist of general facts and information that is catered to the general public. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p4.34">The unique features include the visual tours of Greenpeace ships with interesting diary extracts of live experiences. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p4.34">There is also substantial coverage on the research and development aspect of this pressure group, as there are extensive links on the new technologies, laboratories, the scientific team and the impact of science on its campaigns and policies. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.34">
<s n="s1.1;p5.34">Next, there is also a section covering the past and current activities of this pressure group that is titled "Campaigns" and "Special campaign projects" respectively as well as an outreach section catered towards interested volunteers or donors, activists and potential job seekers in this field. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.34">
<s n="s1.3;p6.34">Lastly, it has research and journal articles that are targeted at journalists, researchers or students. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p6.34">If one is looking for educational resources, the coverage of topics is not extensive but there is more focus on depth on three core topics on the Amazon, GM food and Nature power which is substantiated with teaching materials. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p6.34">In addition, there is an online "media centre" which has an advanced media search engine that can search for documents by media type, campaign or dates which is very useful for one to navigate through the extensive archive of press releases, media briefings, reports and images and latest campaign news. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.34">
<s n="s1.2;p7.34">In all, the usefulness and relevance of the website depends on what your search agenda is and the information that you are trying to retrieve. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p7.34">The coverage and scope of this pressure group's website can be labeled accurately as extensive enough for its agenda and whether you are a researcher, journalist, student, teacher or activist, there is definitely a piece of information relevant and useful to a certain extent. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.34">
<s n="s1.5;p8.34">Moreover, the effectiveness and usefulness is enhanced by the layout and organization of content of the website. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p8.34">The links facilitate the retrieval of information as it does not take many links to get to something useful. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p8.34">An added advantage is that the site is user friendly; the headings are all on the left column, the special commands are clear and help information is readily available as there is a help section as well as a site map. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p8.34">Besides, there is an internal search engine that can retrieve information efficiently though the effective aspect can be improved on. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p8.34">Lastly, there is also a QNA section which answers your queries directly without having to navigate through the site. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.34">
<s n="s1.5;p9.34">There are also additional features which enhance its effectiveness and attractiveness. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p9.34">It seeks to publicize its activities and policy positions by adopting a personal touch. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p9.34">There are E Cards for spreading messages to loved ones, an online catalogue as well as an E Bulletin which is an efficient way of publicity and awareness that is delivered straight to the inbox. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p9.34">Moreover, one can personalize the webpage; there's a section called "My Greenpeace" that allows one to personalize the Greenpeace website according to the Greenpeace campaigns, information and types of documents that might interest oneself, then the latest news and updates in those areas will automatically be flagged up on the homepage every time one enters the site. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p9.34">Therefore, personalization can help you access the information that you need with ease. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.34">
<s n="s1.2;p10.34">Despite the seemingly perfect features, there are some improvements which can be made. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p10.34">These improvements that are proposed are based on a comparative approach; comparing the layout and content information of Greenpeace's website with the websites of World Wide Fund (WWF) and Friends of the Earth (FOE) as they are the two pressure groups that are most similar in outlook and agenda. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.34">
<s n="s1.5;p11.34">Unlike WWF, Greenpeace's web site lacks an annual review or an assessment chart to track the progress of the organization and success as a pressure group. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p11.34">Hence, perhaps it should have an overall report available in PDF format that highlights its financial statements, latest or upcoming events and future developments. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p11.34">Furthermore, if you are trying to find out the structural organization of its workings as a subsidiary, there is insufficient information on this aspect. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p11.34">There is a section on the history and evolution of Greenpeace that has a general timeline but it is only updated till year 2002. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p11.34">Hence, it should have more current updates on the operational aspect of the pressure group. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.34">
<s n="s1.3;p12.34">In addition, the search engine should be more specific like WWF's which can generate new search results within some options like within results, all of WWF.org.uk, or WWFlearning.org.uk. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p12.34">It would also be helpful if the website was accessible in other languages. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p12.34">Lastly, the currency of the website is questionable as it was last edited on 14 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> October 2004 though the press releases and articles are all up to date. </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.34">
<s n="s1.1;p13.34">Hence, from the website alone, it is possible to deduce that Greenpeace is truly an independent, campaigning organization that sought to fulfill its mission though its real effectiveness cannot be simply inferred from the website as it depends on both internal and external factors. </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.34">
<s n="s1.2;p14.34">Its effectiveness will be based on assessing Greenpeace as an entity not in terms of its subsidiaries as the goals and activities of its subsidiaries should parallel that of the parent organization as well. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p14.34">In particular, the extent of effectiveness really depends on the measurement criterion of effectiveness and as we examine the various main factors that make it more or less effective, we are able to get the overall extent of its effectiveness or ineffectiveness over time. </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.34">
<s n="s1.2;p15.34">The main factors that measure the effectiveness of Greenpeace and other pressure groups are as follows; the nature of membership, resources, access to media and politics and lastly the tactical approach or strategies that it adopts. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p15.34">By examining each factor in specific, we will be able to derive the effectiveness of Greenpeace in each separate sphere. </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.34">
<s n="s1.5;p16.34">To begin with, the size and quality of membership is a crucial factor that will determine the success of a cause group, in particular environmental groups like Greenpeace. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p16.34">It is important that Greenpeace is able to retain its members as well as attract new members. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p16.34">Its membership mobilization capabilities can be a direct reflection of its viability and sustainability as a credible and effective pressure group. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p16.34">Table 1<ref target="BAWE_0137f-ftnote.003"/> illustrates that Greenpeace's membership peaked in 1991 and then steadily declined. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p16.34">This could be due to a shift in global sentiments worldwide as public environmental awareness receded globally and with it the membership of many environmental groups.<ref target="BAWE_0137f-ftnote.004"/> Thus far, Greenpeace has maintained its membership numbers despite the decline in the 1990s and this is a reflection of its effectiveness at retaining membership more than attracting new membership. </s>

<s n="s1.1;p17.34">Another important factor that will affect the effectiveness of the pressure group is the availability and organization of its resources; structural organization, financial resources and staffing resources. </s>
</p>
<p n="p18.34">
<s n="s1.5;p18.34">In terms of internal group structure such as decision making, conflict reduction mechanism and leadership, Greenpeace is very much differentiated from other environmental pressure groups. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p18.34">The very nature of Greenpeace's global membership and worldwide operations requires a centralized leadership that will be able to take into account of the different interests and viewpoints of their members while being able to develop effective policies and to respond to changing events. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p18.34">This helps to explain why Greenpeace has opted for hierarchical structures with little democratic control over the direction of their campaigns. </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0137f-ftnote.005"/>
<s n="s4.5;p18.34">Such an operational structure has its advantages but a central problem is the management of internal interest diversity which is worsened by power struggles between individuals and branches. </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0137f-ftnote.006"/>
<s n="s5.5;p18.34">The ineffectiveness is exacerbated by the highly publicized exits of members and the formation of breakaway organizations which can be detrimental to its reputation. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p19.34">The control and availability of its financial resources is also an indirect measure of its effectiveness as the success of its campaign and outreach activities are limited by financial resources. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p19.34">In 1999 Greenpeace received â‚¬126 million from donations, which rose to â‚¬157.7 million in 2002. </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0137f-ftnote.007"/>
<s n="s3.5;p19.34">Despite the rise in donations, Greenpeace is much smaller financially than the companies and governments it usually targets, with a global income of only about â‚¬165 million in 2002 (Tables 2 and 3)<ref target="BAWE_0137f-ftnote.008"/>. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p19.34">It is also notable that expenditure on fund-raising has risen substantially (up 124 per cent) within the organization worldwide in five years, brought about mainly through the national offices seeking to maintain and increase their supporter base. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p26.34">In terms of campaigning style, Greenpeace was once the vanguard of radical environmentalism and direct action in the 1970s but it has professionalized over time and has become more strategically managed, hence it has adopted other styles of campaigning. </s>
