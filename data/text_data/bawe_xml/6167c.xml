<s n="s1.1;p2.40">Introduction: </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.40">
<s n="s1.1;p3.40">Anon (1988) stated "the packaging as the enclosure of products, items or packages in a wrapped pouch, bag, box, cup, tray, can, tube, bottle or other container form to perform one or more of the following functions: containment, protection and/ or preservation, communication and utility or performance". </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.40">
<s n="s1.14;p4.40">Packaging provides a barrier between the food and the environment. </s>
<s n="s2.14;p4.40">And it control light transmission, the transfer of heat, moisture and gases, and movement of microorganisms or insects (Fellows, 1988). </s>
<s n="s3.14;p4.40">Light transmission is employed in packages that are intended to display the contents and provide a platform for labeling. </s>
<s n="s4.14;p4.40">But the light transmission is restricted when foods are susceptible to deterioration by light, such as the oxidation of lipids, loss of color and denaturation of protein. </s>
<s n="s5.14;p4.40">For example low-density polyethylene (LDPE) transmits both visible and ultraviolet light, polyvinylidene chloride transmit visible light but absorb UV light. </s>
<s n="s6.14;p4.40">Packaging should also have certain level of heat resistance, especially when packaging hot food then package shrinking may occur. </s>
<s n="s7.14;p4.40">The permeability of the packaging material to gases and moisture and the packaging procedures employed can influence the type of microorganisms that grow within the package. </s>
<s n="s8.14;p4.40">For fresh food, such as fruit, vegetable and meat, which still respire after harvesting, the water vapor may condense inside the packages if the existed water can not be vapor out of the package that may lead spoilage occur. </s>
<s n="s9.14;p4.40">At the same time, the gases produced by content such as the carbon dioxide, ethylene, have double-side influences. </s>
<s n="s10.14;p4.40">On one hand, the high density of carbon dioxide in the package that can limit the microorganisms growth to achieve the extend shelf-life, on the other hand, the gases may deteriorate or over harvested the food. </s>
<s n="s11.14;p4.40">By researching, the water existing in the package may occur interaction with the certain film and generate hazard compounds when the environment of outside have changed, such the high temperature, high moisture. </s>
<s n="s12.14;p4.40">So the consideration of what kind of materials can run the job for individual food should be prior to the packaging. </s>
<s n="s13.14;p4.40">Another essential property of film is mechanical strength which is the ability of packages to protect foods from mechanical damage had been measured in this practical. </s>
<s n="s14.14;p4.40">The factor of material mechanical strength is influenced by the temperature of material and the length of time that the force is applied (Briston, 1974). </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.40">
<s n="s1.2;p5.40">The materials of package are varied. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p5.40">In this practical, we chose paper, regenerated cellulose 350 MS, regenerated cellulose 340 D.M.S, polyethylene, polypropylene, aluminium foil and Cryovac S film whose permeability of water vapor, violate compound and the tensile strength had been tested. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.40">
<s n="s1.4;p6.40">Paper almost used for food packaging is made from wood. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p6.40">Some papers are made from repulped waster paper which increases the incident of contamination of microbes and the paper may give off odors which are likely to cause tainting of the contents (Brennan, 2006). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p6.40">In food manufactory, the coated papers are more commonly used. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p6.40">For example, aluminium coated paper enhance the barrier property of water vapor and gases. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.40">
<s n="s1.4;p7.40">Regenerated cellulose (cellophane) differs from the polymer films in that it is made from wood pulp. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p7.40">It can provides general protect against dust and dirt, some mechanical protection and is greaseproof. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p7.40">When the environment is dry it is a good barrier to gases, but becomes highly permeable when wet. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p7.40">The codes are used to reflect the property of regenerated cellulose films: </s>

</p>
<p n="p12.40">
<s n="s1.3;p12.40">Polyethylene (PE) commonly called polythene which can be divided into LDPE, MDPE and HDPE with different density. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p12.40">LDPE have most widely used in the food packaging due to its strength, low permeability to water vapor and it forms a very strong heat seal. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p12.40">But it is not good barrier to gases oils and volatiles (Brennan, 2006). </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.40">
<s n="s1.2;p13.40">Polypropylene is a clear glossy film with good optical properties and a high tensile strength and puncture resistance. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p13.40">It has moderate permeability to moisture, gases and odors, which is not affected by the changes in humidity ((Fellows, 1988). </s>

<s n="s3.15;p37.40">And the proportion of water is 75%. </s>
<s n="s4.15;p37.40">During 7 days, the paper covering meat lost weight about 44.18%, and meat became dry and contracted. </s>
<s n="s5.15;p37.40">The color of meat changed from cherry red to dark red and although there was not significant green patch found, we could not evaluate the meat packaged in paper that was not spoiled due to the meat was exposed in air where contain lots of microorganisms can lead the meat contaminated. </s>
<s n="s6.15;p37.40">Base on the result, the paper just can package ready-to-eat foods that do not required storage for long period. </s>
<s n="s7.15;p37.40">Polypropylene was good moisture barrier, so even during the 7 days, the weight had no significant change that means there was no moisture or litter moisture go through the polypropylene into environment, at the same time, polypropylene was low oxygen permeability, so the intensity of oxygen in the package was limited that avoided the oxidation interaction inside the package and contributed the quality better than other samples. </s>
<s n="s8.15;p37.40">But we could find lots of water condensed from meat could not be emitted from package that may lead the meat total became green in the second Monday morning. </s>
<s n="s9.15;p37.40">So the polypropylene is not suitable for foods contained lot of water that may lead alternation. </s>
<s n="s10.15;p37.40">By compared the percentages of weight lost of meats packaged by 340 D.M.S reg-cellulose and 350 M.S reg-cellulose were 10.05% and 6.21% respectively. </s>
<s n="s11.15;p37.40">The 350 M.S.'s property is moistureproof that had been proved by the data of this test. </s>
<s n="s12.15;p37.40">But the meat's quality can not maintain satisfactory after packaging 3 days, some green patches had been found caused by oxygen that can transmission though cellulose into package. </s>
<s n="s13.15;p37.40">The 340 DMS packaged meat had been determined spoil in the 2 <hi rend="sup">nd</hi> day. </s>
<s n="s14.15;p37.40">There was a green patch about 1 cm diameter in the center of meat. </s>
<s n="s15.15;p37.40">So cellulose is used for foods that do not require a complete moisture or gas barrier. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p38.40">Using polyethylene and polyethylene with holes to package potatoes and observed the changes in 3 different environments. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p38.40">No matter in fridge at 4° or in shelf at room temperature or in dark box at room temperature, polyethylene without holes had less water lost, in another words, polyethylene is a good water vapour moisture barrier. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p38.40">The holes on the surface of package accelerated the moisture evaporation that leaded more than 67% weight lose compared with polyethylene without holes. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p38.40">Compared the weight lost in fridge about 4 ° with the weight lost in room temperature about 25°, the previous had less sprouting than the later, the one reason may be the low temperature decreased the biochemical reaction in the potatoes and prolonged the shelf life and limited respiration rate. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p38.40">The potatoes stored in warm temperature sprouted quickly than in the low temperature and light also contributed the color turn to green. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p39.40">Compared 6 different packaging material to range the permeability to odours and flavours, we could found, if set no packaged chocolate was the standard of strongest mint flavours, polyethylene was greater than cellulose and polypropylene and foil. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p39.40">In principle, polyethylene should have lower odours permeability than cellulose, I thought the reason contributed the result was the seal of polyethylene was not very hermetic, so the mint odors leaked inside and affected the plain chocolate flavours. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p39.40">The original packaging was good odor barrier which was associated with double membranes including foil and cellulose so less mint odor in the chocolate after 7 days. </s>

<s n="s2.4;p40.40">The result showed us that in each package, the cheese all sweated but the changes occurred in different days with different material that means all material have certain level gas permeability, and the vacuum packaged in PE and heat sealed, then another vacuum packaged with reg. cellulose 350 MS over the already packed sample had the less vacuum lose compared with others. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p40.40">Foil packaged cheese grew lots of mould may caused by the leaks between the foil. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p40.40">Cryovac S film packaged cheese oiling at the 2 <hi rend="sup">nd</hi> days but Cryovac S film limited the mould growth on the surface of cheese. </s>
