<hi rend="bold">Solution 4.1</hi> Silicon is not used as piezoelectric material because in order to translate deformation into an electrical signal using piezoelectric effects we need a thin film material. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p1.34">In addition silicon is cubic and covalent rather than ionic and non-centro symmetric. </s>
