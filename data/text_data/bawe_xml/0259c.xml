<s n="s1.7;p1.35">It is the method of the phenomenological reduction that distinguished Husserl from all others. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p1.35">Not only did he spend his entire career carefully writing further and further elaboration of its proper conception, but although many of his students took on the general idea of the reductions and incorporated it into their own work, not one followed him in its complete application. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p1.35">In fact, by the end of his life, Husserl's students had all to some degree or another turned away from his teachings, being convinced that Husserl had taken phenomenology down an overly idealist path. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p1.35">Now, it is obvious from the opening quote that the charge of idealism would be readily admitted by Husserl himself. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p1.35">From as early as Ideas 1, Husserl began to argue that the only possible conclusion to be taken from the phenomenological method was that of transcendental idealism.<ref target="BAWE_0259c-ftnote.002"/> And although he maintained this position with increasing conviction for the remainder of his life, at the same time he maintained that by this he was taking no stance on metaphysics, or at least not an idealist metaphysical stance. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p1.35">He explicitly fought against his work being interpreted along the lines of idealism typically conceived (i.e. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p1.35">Berkeylan idealism), seeing his own contribution as staying within the realm of epistemology. </s>

<p n="p2.35">
<s n="s1.5;p2.35">Despite Husserl's insistence to the contrary, the charge of metaphysical idealism can still be argued for convincingly. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p2.35">Roman Ingarden, in his work <hi rend="italic">On the Motives which led Husserl to Transcendental Idealism</hi>, takes up precisely this issue.<ref target="BAWE_0259c-ftnote.003"/> In this paper, I will first explain Husserl's reduction in terms of his philosophical project as a whole, its role as key methodological tool becoming apparent. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p2.35">Second, I will argue, following some of the criticisms laid out by Ingarden in <hi rend="italic">Motives</hi>, that the reduction in the way Husserl conceived of it, can and must be interpreted as taking a particular metaphysical stance: an idealistic one. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p2.35">It will be crucial, in order to fully understand Ingarden's criticisms, and to do as much justice to Husserl as possible, to come to grips with how this idealism is unique, and therefore not to be confused with a Berkeleyan-style metaphysical idealism. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p2.35">Despite the fact that Husserl denied vehemently that he was committed to any metaphysical position, idealistic or otherwise, it will become clear that Ingarden's criticisms are justified, and that, acknowledged by Husserl or not, the reduction not only suggests, but insists significant metaphysical implications. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p3.35">Although Ingarden is by no means the originator of the interpretation of Husserl as a metaphysical idealist, I have chosen his work for two reasons. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p3.35">First, Ingarden was for many years a student of Husserl, considered for much of that time to be Husserl's favourite. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p3.35">From this we can fairly expect that Ingarden had excellent opportunity to gain a sophisticated grasp of Husserl's work. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p3.35">Second, Ingarden was for his entire career centrally concerned with the idealism/realism debate, his thoughts made fully manifest in his magnum opus <hi rend="italic">Controversy over the Existence of the World</hi>. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p3.35">The problem of idealism is not Ingarden's side project; it is the driving issue of his philosophical career. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p3.35">What this adds up to, in my mind, is a potentially more interesting and worthwhile critic. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p3.35">Indeed, I take Ingarden's critique to be based on a sound and charitable reading of Husserl, and I think he quite rightly elaborates (what he argues to be) inevitable metaphysical conclusions. </s>

<p n="p5.35">
<s n="s1.3;p5.35">Influenced heavily by his early career in mathematics, as well as the reigning ideal of scientific objectivity, Husserl's goal was to set up for cognition absolute foundations.<ref target="BAWE_0259c-ftnote.004"/> Philosophy, as the investigation into the meaning of being, and thus the most ultimate human discipline, must, for Husserl, identify itself with the scientific ideal, i.e. it must be <hi rend="italic">objective</hi> and <hi rend="italic">apodictic</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p5.35">What this demands is "the demonstration of an absolutely certain, indubitable philosophical cognition and the elaboration of a method of inquiry that may be systematically employed in order to ensure the validity of such cognition".<ref target="BAWE_0259c-ftnote.005"/> Through the method he spent his entire life carefully elaborating, he believed to have established a way to provide clear and incontrovertible evidence for and thereby knowledge of that which is. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p5.35">Phenomenology, and its method of the reduction, was the only philosophy to achieve this standard. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p6.35">The term 'phenomenology' refers back to Kantian terminology, where the <hi rend="italic">phenomenon</hi> is taken as reality-appearing-to-consciousness, as opposed to the <hi rend="italic">noumenon</hi>, or the realm of being of reality-as-it-is-in-itself. </s>

<s n="s3.8;p7.35">Clearly, taking on this belief would exclude phenomenology from succeeding in describing the real essence of any one of its objects of investigation. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p7.35">However, phenomenology as a whole takes its beginning in the conviction that, contrary to Kant, the essences of things <hi rend="italic">are</hi> to be found in reality as it appears to consciousness. </s>
