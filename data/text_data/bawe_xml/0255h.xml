<s n="s5.6;p6.13">For American historians, if the historical intention of their scholarship was not to achieve the pinnacle of objective and empirical factual history, thereby mistakenly taking Ranke as its epitome, then the development of a political history intended to bolster liberal academic prestige was the priority. </s>

<s n="s2.7;p8.13">In 1908, George B. Adams proclaimed that "the first duty of the historian" was to discover "wie es eigentlich gewesen", and in this address to the nascent American Historical Association he called Ranke their "leader". </s>
<s n="s3.7;p8.13">The academic history of this school was steeped in a scientific thirst for objectivity and factual sophistication. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p8.13">Undeniably, this was paramount in Rankean historicism but their brief and simplistic reading of his work led them to assume that Ranke believed that the only job of the historian was to establish 'facts for their own sake'.<ref target="BAWE_0255h-ftnote.010"/> Iggers has shown that it is necessary to revise this view of Ranke, and believes that the process for re-interpreting his work began with Ferdinand Schevill, who pointed out that these American historians had created a "leader" that "bore little resemblance to the real Ranke, who had been led to the study of history by philosophical and religious interests". </s>

<s n="s1.9;p9.13">Ranke's misunderstood legacy amongst twentieth-century historians has in some cases given rise to the belief that Ranke wished to indiscriminately sever the relationship between history as an art and as a science. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p9.13">In 1902, J.B. Bury noted that "history is a science, no more, no less", because of the "minute method of analysing...sources and scrupulously exact conformity to facts". </s>
<s n="s3.9;p9.13">However, this is the stripping down of history to its bare bones - removing the literary aspect of narration, which for Ranke would have meant the destruction of history. </s>

<s n="s5.9;p9.13">'Careful evaluation and authentication of primary source material is one of Ranke's most significant legacies'.<ref target="BAWE_0255h-ftnote.012"/> True, but it is only one aspect. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p9.13">The dangers of misinterpreting Ranke are numerous - they can lead to boring factual history as championed by Bury and also, perhaps at the extreme, it can lead to moral relativism. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p9.13">The idea that all epochs and attitudes are equal before God and that all morals are of equal value can lead to the formation of dangerous philosophies. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p9.13">Since 'absolute truth is unattainable' then 'all statements about history are connected or relative to the position of those that make them', hence one set of morals becomes just as perfectly justifiable and acceptable as another.<ref target="BAWE_0255h-ftnote.013"/> However, a closer look at Ranke's philosophy shows us that, true to his belief in an all-pervasive universal element governing history, the particularity of specific individuals and epochs was set "apart from certain unchanging, eternal dominant ideas, such as moral ideas". </s>
<s n="s9.9;p9.13">Morality was not subject to change because it was part of 'the universal human reality transcending each of its individual expressions'.<ref target="BAWE_0255h-ftnote.014"/> </s>

<s n="s2.12;p10.13">The rediscovery of the 'rhetoric and aesthetics of historiography' has become important because its modernity was 'defined by its academic or - in a broader sense of the word - by its scientific character'. </s>
<s n="s3.12;p10.13">The problem inherent in this approach is that it leads to a tendentious interpretation. </s>
<s n="s4.12;p10.13">It is possible to see Ranke as the epitome of mediation between these diverging points of view because he combined a 'new academic standard' with renewed 'literary quality'. </s>
<s n="s5.12;p10.13">In order to "show how it really had been", Ranke elevated empirical qualities above the dated and imprecise rhetoric and dialogue which was preferred by historians of older generations, such as Francesco Guicciardini. </s>
<s n="s6.12;p10.13">He viewed rhetorical dialogues as 'language tricks' which were subordinate to 'convincing argument' based on well corroborated evidence. </s>
<s n="s7.12;p10.13">The process of unmasking historical intention was not abandoned by him, but Ranke, as we have already seen, did not wish to impose the prejudice of contemporary society upon the past. </s>
<s n="s8.12;p10.13">That said it is important not to ignore the artistic style of Ranke's history - 'whereas the principles of research are scientific in their nature and belong to the realm of modern methodological rationality, the principles of writing history are artistic...and belong to the realm of literature'. </s>

<s n="s2.6;p12.13">He has argued that Ranke did indeed base his history upon the foundations of sound scientific research, but that above and beyond that he adhered to higher philosophical and theological principles. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p12.13">Krieger has pointed out that, '[f]or Ranke, then, what was beyond the fact was more valuable than the fact itself', and he believes that Ranke's affinity with natural science went beyond the basic level of methodological research to the search for a "higher principle" in 'nature and life'. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p12.13">However, one cannot escape the constant recurrence in his work of the 'dramatic invocation of history as the dwelling place and revelation of God'. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p12.13">These ideas reached 'higher than the empirical reality of discrete events'.<ref target="BAWE_0255h-ftnote.019"/> Surely then his adherence to these abstract notions, ideas that were more important and more profoundly set in his historical philosophy, show us that he was merely concerned with scientific principle as a more precise tool than rhetoric, in particular the rhetoric of invented speech, with which to convince his audience. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p12.13">For Ranke, 'individual reality' and individual historical events were a 'manifestation of a universal principle', a consequence of "laws, more mysterious and greater than one usually thinks".<ref target="BAWE_0255h-ftnote.020"/> </s>
