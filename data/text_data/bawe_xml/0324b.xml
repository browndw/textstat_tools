<p n="p9.20">
<s n="s1.4;p9.20">The Rawlsian conception of justice is definitely a useful alternative to the utilitarian conception of justice. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p9.20">The first difference between the two conceptions of justice is that the utilitarian approach does not consider how benefits and burdens are distributed in a society. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p9.20">Since Utilitarianism seeks to maximise the sum of utility over an entire society, even an unjust distribution that will achieve maximum utility is considered ideal. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p9.20">For example, it may be plausible that utility is maximised in a society which practices slavery. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.20">
<s n="s1.4;p10.20">In this respect, the Rawlsian conception of justice is a more desirable alternative. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p10.20">Rawls argues that the principle of utility can be extended only to individuals but not to society as a whole. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p10.20">Specifically, a society cannot be the sole decision maker who has the autonomy to shift benefits and burdens as it wishes in order to reach some greater good. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p10.20">Hence, the utilitarian inability to adequately explain our individual commitments to justice seems to enhance the appeal of Rawls's conception of justice. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.20">
<s n="s1.3;p11.20">Closely linked to the point above, the Utilitarian conception of justice also negates individualism and violates individual choice. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p11.20">The decision-making heuristic for Utilitarianism is derived from the perspective of a sole impartial ``perfect legislator'', which conflates the many diverse desire systems present in a society and imposes a single desire system by which to measure utility.<ref target="BAWE_0324b-ftnote.008"/> Hence, Rawls's conception of justice is certainly more attractive as "justice as fairness" gives more room for individual choice and hence greater support to men's self respect. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p11.20">Another fellow critic of utilitarianism, Nozick also affirmed Rawls's view that the sacrifice of one individual for the greater social good does not bring due respect to a person as "a separate person, that his is the only life he has" <ref target="BAWE_0324b-ftnote.009"/>. </s>

</p>
<p n="p14.20">
<s n="s1.4;p14.20">Firstly, Rawls's position on justice has important features in common with utilitarianism's; which ironically exposes his arguments to very same objections that he levels against the utilitarian. </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0324b-ftnote.012"/>
<s n="s2.4;p14.20">Both views regard the concept of justice as a "derivative" status and must be viewed as "subordinate" to a "higher criterion" <ref target="BAWE_0324b-ftnote.013"/>. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p14.20">Utilitarians believe in the principle of utility as the higher standard while Rawls's two principles are the "correct higher criterion" <ref target="BAWE_0324b-ftnote.014"/>. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p14.20">Significantly, Nozick, classifies both the utilitarian and the Rawlsian principles of justice as end-result principles. <ref target="BAWE_0324b-ftnote.015"/> </s>

<s n="s1.2;p15.20">Most importantly, the two conceptions of justice converge when "justice as fairness" could be the most utilitarian result in a society, hence upholding Rawls's notion of justice together with the Utilitarian conception of an ideally just society. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p15.20">Clearly, there are many similarities as much as there are differences between the two, and the recognition of the former weakens the argument that Rawls has put forth an alternative theory, much less a superior one. </s>

<p n="p16.20">
<s n="s1.4;p16.20">Secondly, how plausible is it that individuals would choose Rawlsian principles over Utilitarian principles? </s>
<s n="s2.4;p16.20">Rawls's formal aim is to show that the parties in the original position would prefer his own conception of justice. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p16.20">His justification was that due to the veil of ignorance in the Original Position, rational individuals are forced to choose the rules of society through "Maxim Strategy"; a rational individual who is ignorant of the structured society to come will maximise what one could get if they were in the minimum or worst off position. </s>

<p n="p17.20">
<s n="s1.4;p17.20">While the above situation is desirable for a state of justice to prevail, it is questionable how applicable this imaginary state of affairs is to the real world. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p17.20">After all, how does Rawls know how rational beings behave in the "original position"? </s>
<s n="s3.4;p17.20">He makes a serious assumption that everyone is rational and capable of a sense of justice. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p17.20">In all, he fails to put forth a theory of how society works, much less a feasible theory of how society ought to work. </s>
</p>
<p n="p18.20">
<s n="s1.6;p18.20">Lastly, there are also some theoretical flaws in Rawls's argument. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p18.20">If we follow his argument that the veil of ignorance appears to "exclude any attempt to maximise expectations which would lead toward utilitarianism" <ref target="BAWE_0324b-ftnote.017"/>, it would blind us to the fact that probability calculations are possible in the original position. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p18.20">There is no reason why one cannot use personal information (talents and capabilities) for calculating the likelihood of one's condition. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p18.20">Despite the veil of ignorance, the parties in the original position can still calculate to maximise general expectation and naturally incline toward utilitarianism.<ref target="BAWE_0324b-ftnote.018"/> Furthermore, the notion of individual choice is merely an illusion if we are forced by circumstances to make the choice of Rawlsian principles over utilitarian principles. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p18.20">Important conditions laid down by Rawls are designed not only to simply the choice problem but also "to ensure the moral quality of the outcome"<ref target="BAWE_0324b-ftnote.019"/>. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p18.20">Hence, it seems that the conceptions of justice derived from his methodology stems out of prudence rather than from a genuine understanding of justice. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p20.20">Indeed, the Rawlsian conception of "justice as fairness" is a more desirable alternative to the utilitarian conceptions of justice because it is ultimately a normative inquiry about a justice that ought to be or determines what ought to be. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p20.20">It is important that we value Rawlsian conception of "justice as fairness" as an achievement in itself and assess its success by his intentions of the writing together with its success as an alternative to another school of thought. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p20.20">However as much as we give credit to its idealistic worth, the Rawlsian conception has failed to be a feasible alternative to the Utilitarian conceptions of justice. </s>
