<head rend="bold">CONCLUSION</head>
<p n="p25.25">
<s n="s1.5;p25.25">Understanding the origin and developmental pathway of plant organs, physiology, and morphological variation and the traits of changes in genes offer vital clues to answer the evolution of plants. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p25.25">Genetic analysis on particular genes and the identification of their functions on morphological control over a plant body tells how plants are created. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p25.25">The relationship with external factors such as the environment also needs to be taken into account, however, no single environmental components only but a genome can evoke changes in morphology and physiology of plants. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p25.25">The application of findings to various purposes such as for agriculture has shown remarkable contribution. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p25.25">Recent progress on the methodology has expanded the possibility for study and the understanding of plant world. </s>
