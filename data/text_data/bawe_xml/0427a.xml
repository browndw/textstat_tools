<p n="p1.61">
<s n="s1.3;p1.61">The above proverb was quoted by James Wolfensohn, President of the World Bank, 1995. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p1.61">He argues that educating girls has a catalytic effect on the economic development which includes higher productivity and faster economic growth. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p1.61">However, in many countries, especially in the developing countries, males get higher level of schooling than female, i.e. there is an educational gender gap. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.61">
<s n="s1.2;p2.61">It is believed that female and male education has affected output and growth in different ways. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p2.61">Female education, as with male education, can improve productivity and contribute directly to the output of the economy and, indirectly, through social gains by reducing fertility and infant mortality(especially in developing countries), improving family and child health, and increasing the quantity and quality of children's educational attainment. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.61">
<s n="s1.1;p3.61">Studies using cross-country macro-level data pick up not only the direct effects of female education, but also the indirect effects not captured using micro level data. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.61">
<s n="s1.3;p4.61">The aim of this paper is to estimate a neoclassical growth model that includes male and female education as separate explanatory variables. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p4.61">The average long-run effects of male and female education on output per worker are estimated for a cross-section of countries using <hi rend="italic">long time averages</hi> of the data. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p4.61">The results support the World Bank's emphasis on the importance of female education in raising labour productivity. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.61">
<s n="s1.4;p5.61">This paper follows the paper by Stephen Knowles, Paula K. lorgelly and P.Dorian Owen. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p5.61">(2002). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p5.61">'Are educational gender gaps a brake on economic development?' </s>
<s n="s4.4;p5.61">They based their results on data obtained for a mixed group of countries for the period 1960 to 1990 using OLS on time averages of the data and concluded that female education contributed significantly to the labour productivity across countries. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.61">
<s n="s1.1;p6.61">The following paper uses the same technique for a sample of 38 countries consisting of developed and developing countries over the period 1995 to 2004 and attempts to prove that female education plays a significant role in the overall development of the economy. </s>

<head rend="bold">2. Literature Review</head>
<p n="p8.61">
<s n="s1.4;p8.61">The cross-country macroeconomic literature seems far from reaching a common consensus on the role of female education. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p8.61">Some studies report OLS regressions with positive effects of both male and female education on growth. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p8.61">For example, Benovat (1989) reports the above result using primary and secondary school enrolments. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p8.61">However, since none of the regressions use both male and female enrolments in the same equation, the results may not be significant for the study of gender gaps in education. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.61">
<s n="s1.3;p9.61">Hill and King (1995) go one step ahead and introduce educational gender gap in cross-sectional output regression. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p9.61">They also use school enrolments as a proxy for level of education. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p9.61">Their results show a positive significant impact of female education on GDP. According to them the social benefits of women's education range from improving economic growth to increasing life expectancy in the population, to improving the functioning of the political processes. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.61">
<s n="s1.5;p10.61">By contrast, Barro and Lee (1994) find that there is a significant negative partial correlation between economic growth and female secondary schooling. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p10.61">They use average years of schooling instead of enrolment rates. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p10.61">They explain the negative coefficient as a result of backwardness due to a high spread between male and female secondary educational attainment. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p10.61">This in turn would mean a higher growth potential through the convergence mechanism. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p10.61">However, according to Sims, C.A (1996), a major problem with the results of these studies is that the equations estimated are ad hoc and it is not clear how the coefficients are to be interpreted. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.61">
<s n="s1.3;p11.61">The studies by Barro include life expectancy as a proxy for health component of human capital. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p11.61">According to Knowles and Owen, when education is not aggregated by gender it is not statistically significant in models that include life expectancy. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p11.61">The level of educational attainment then has no explanatory power for growth. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.61">
<s n="s1.4;p12.61">In response to the problems above, Caselli et al (1996) re-estimate Barro and Lee's equations using GMM estimator. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p12.61">They obtain a significant positive coefficient on female schooling and a negative one on male schooling. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p12.61">They argue that female education captures the positive fertility effects and negative human capital effects, former outweighing the latter. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p12.61">Male education on the other hand only represents the human capital effects and therefore has a negative coefficient. </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.61">
<s n="s1.4;p13.61">Other studies, e.g. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p13.61">Knight et al (1993) using five-year panels find education to have significant negative effect. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p13.61">They assume that this could be due to five-year intervals being too short to account for the effect of education on growth. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p13.61">They argue that cross-sectional data using time averages may be the preferred proxy in estimating the effects of human capital investment on growth. </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.61">
<s n="s1.2;p14.61">It is to be noted that one thing that all the studies in this area have in common is the lack of explicit theoretical framework. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p61.61">The aim of this paper was to see whether increasing female schooling leads to higher levels of labour productivity across countries and whether educational gender gaps are an impediment to economic development. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p61.61">Although the existing papers using cross-country macro level data have failed to reach a common conclusion and this paper is not free from bias in the data, the results obtained support the World Bank's claim about the importance of female education in improving output per worker. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p61.61">Therefore, a reduction or elimination of the prevailing educational gender gaps would lead to overall development across countries through the convergence mechanism. </s>
