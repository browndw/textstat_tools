<s n="s2.7;p7.10">In light of this, Lord Steyn emphasised the significant benefits derived from the retention of such information. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p7.10">For example, it would mean that compelling evidence that was lawfully obtained could not then be dismissed in future cases. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p7.10">Furthermore it could be used to eliminate the innocent, correct miscarriages of justice and detect the guilty: 'The Home Office statistics show that there is a 40% chance that a crime scene sample will be matched immediately with an individual's profile on the database." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0122a-ftnote.017"/>
<s n="s5.7;p7.10">However the appellants believed that it was disproportionate, and in agreement with Sedley LJ in his dissenting judgement of the Court of Appeal hearing, argued that the authorities should use their discretion to decide whether to retain evidence.<ref target="BAWE_0122a-ftnote.018"/> However, Lord Steyn argued, and the others agreed, that retention of information was proportionate to the aims of public policy. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p7.10">One reason given in support of this was that the person (from whom the samples were obtained) would only be detected again if the authorities had found a duplicate match. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p7.10">Moreover the legislation in place restricted the use of the information so that it only dealt with the policy aims of reducing crime and increasing detection rates.<ref target="BAWE_0122a-ftnote.019"/> Therefore, even though Baroness Hale dissented from the majority in terms of whether the retention of fingerprints, DNA profiles and samples engaged with art 8(1), she still came to the same conclusion that the retention of such information is compatible with the article as a whole. </s>
