<p n="p1.13">
<s n="s1.3;p1.13">GM (genetically modified) foods are a source of much controversy in today's world. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p1.13">Tales of "killer tomatoes" abound - however, behind the scandal and gossip, a real threat lurks. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p1.13">The dangers of GM foods are not mere gossip; they are valid concerns, which need to be addressed before any more harm is done. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.13">
<s n="s1.4;p2.13">To discuss the dangers of genetic modification, first we must understand the concept of genetics. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p2.13">Every living thing known to date is made up of small building blocks, known as "cells". </s>
<s n="s3.4;p2.13">These cells contain a genetic code, unique to each individual, which tells the cell what it should be. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p2.13">In essence, this code, or "DNA", is the biological description of what each creature is, from human hair and eye colour, right down to the shape of bacteria. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.13">
<s n="s1.4;p3.13">Selective breeding, the process of selecting and encouraging desirable traits in a subject population, has been used by humankind for hundreds of years. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p3.13">The principle behind it is the idea that crossing two parents with strong genes leads to the child inheriting those strong genes. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p3.13">If one continues to match parents with certain genes, the traits these genes represent will gradually become more pronounced in the offspring. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p3.13">This has lead to the evolution of distinct types of animal, such as the domesticated dog, whose instincts to attack people and livestock have been selectively bred out over generations. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.13">
<s n="s1.5;p4.13">Genetic modification is different. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p4.13">It uses artificial methods, such as specially designed viruses, to introduce the desired DNA directly into a subject, be it a plant seed, or a living animal. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p4.13">Nor does this DNA have to be a gene the subject could usually carry. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p4.13">Genetic modification has created goats which produce spider silk in their milk (more at <seg type="URL" n="http://www.newscientist.com/channel/health/gm-food/dn1807"/>), and pets which glow under UV light (more at <seg type="URL" n="http://www.newscientist.com/channel/health/gm-food/dn4411"/>). </s>
<s n="s5.5;p4.13">These unnatural combinations show the potential of genetic modification, for good, or for harm. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.13">
<s n="s1.3;p5.13">The potential benefits of genetic modification are great. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p5.13">It holds the possibility to revolutionise the agricultural industry, through pest-resistant plants, abundantly fertile and hardy crops, and even meat-flavoured vegetables. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p5.13">However, these benefits may be far outweighed by the potential threats of GM foods. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.13">
<s n="s1.5;p6.13">The process by which most plants reproduce is termed "pollination". </s>
<s n="s2.5;p6.13">It involves the DNA of a plant, contained in small cells called "pollen". </s>
<s n="s3.5;p6.13">Each grain of pollen contains randomly selected DNA, totalling half of the DNA of the original plant. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p6.13">These cells, scattered to the winds, or communicated by insects, land on specialised parts of other plants, and allow the mixing of genes of the two plants - half from the pollen of one plant, half from the recipient plant. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p6.13">The offspring created thus has genes, and therefore traits, of both of the parent plants. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.13">
<s n="s1.3;p7.13">However, GM crops contain DNA not normally found in such a plant. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p7.13">If they are allowed to pollinate other crops (by the nature of pollination, it is difficult to prevent them from doing so), those genes could spread to the crop population as a whole. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p7.13">Should the gene be harmful, to the plant or indeed to humans, the damage this would cause is indeed reason to be cautious. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.13">
<s n="s1.4;p8.13">This problem can be managed, albeit with difficulty, such as to minimise the risks of contamination. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p8.13">Other risks posed by GM foods are not so easily dealt with, however. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p8.13">The world of nature is a complex one, such that no-one in current society can claim to truly understand how nature, in all its glory, works. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p8.13">As such, interfering with the natural order of things can potentially cause havoc in the living world. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.13">
<s n="s1.4;p9.13">The introduction of rabbits to Australia, in 1859, forever changed the natural balance of the continent. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p9.13">Rabbits have been one of the major causes of extinction in Australia (12% of the native mammal species are now extinct), as well as causing widespread damage to plant life in the area. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p9.13">If something so seemingly benign could cause such harm to the environment, what untold destruction could genetic modification unleash? </s>
<s n="s4.4;p9.13">Scientists have only a limited understanding of the specifics of various genes - the use of such unknown quantities in foodstuffs, and the release of these potential contaminants into the environment as a whole, is risky at best. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.13">
<s n="s1.4;p10.13">Even with control measures in effect, it is still possible for contamination of the environment to occur. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p10.13">Pollen can be contained with difficulty, however other avenues of transmission are possible. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p10.13">Nature is astoundingly adaptable, to the point where it is possible for genes to be transferred between species. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p10.13">This process, known as "horizontal gene transfer", makes a truly worrying case against genetically modified crops. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.13">
<s n="s1.3;p11.13">Horizontal gene transfer does not require pollen to contaminate other plants - in fact there are three different ways in which the transfer can occur. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p11.13">One requires physical contact between the GM plant and another plant, however no such limit exists for the other methods. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p11.13">The combination of these three avenues holds the potential for a gene to travel from a GM plant, through bacteria, viruses, other plants, and animals, even to humans. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.13">
<s n="s1.5;p12.13">Needless to say, this is a grave threat to the environment as a whole. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p12.13">Should the wrong gene "escape" into the environment, the ecosystem of the local area, and potentially that of the entire planet, could be irrevocably altered. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p12.13">This is a concern from both the biological and ethical points of view - What would the consequences of such changes be? </s>
<s n="s4.5;p12.13">Do we have the right to "rebuild" Mother Nature? </s>
<s n="s5.5;p12.13">In the worst case, what effects would a rogue gene have if passed to humankind? </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.13">
<s n="s1.4;p13.13">All of the scenarios above are conjecture - in truth, no-one knows what may or will happen if the use of GM foods continues. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p13.13">However, the risks associated with the use of this technology are sufficiently great to warrant further consideration as to the future of GM technology. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p13.13">We only have one planet; neither science nor technology is advanced enough to replace or repair it should we inadvertently damage the natural balance of the ecology. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p13.13">GM foods are an unnecessary threat to the stability of Nature; to preserve our ecology the use of GM technology must be reconsidered. </s>
