<s n="s1.8;p1.13">The discovery of a sea passage to Asia was not a chief cause for the Ottoman Empire's decline. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p1.13">To assume that the loss of European transit trade was a key factor in the decline is an assumption tainted by an orientalist discourse. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p1.13">More pressing causes for the withering away of the Ottoman state were the incompetence of the Ottoman administration to adapt to changing conditions. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p1.13">Hence, the decline should be attributed to incompetent administrative and economic policies. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p1.13">In addition, failed military adventures contributed to an ever declining central authority. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p1.13">The Dutch Vice-Consul de Willem in Aleppo aptly summarizes this argument - "it is not just one pillar that is broken or weakened, but all four pillars of State: religion, justice, politics and finances." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0147a-ftnote.001"/>
<s n="s7.8;p1.13">Therefore, to assume that external trade was a major aspect of its decline lends too great of an emphasis to the impact of European trade and the underlying orientalist assumptions. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p1.13">This essay will show that the Ottoman Empire crumbled from within and will attempt to disarm those who accentuate the loss of the transit trade as decisive in the Empire's downfall. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p2.13">It is necessary to acknowledge that there was a decrease in transit trade due to internal and external developments. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p2.13">Middle Eastern trade is traditionally regarded as consistent of peddlers, with little central organization and barely any 'advance knowledge of their target market'.<ref target="BAWE_0147a-ftnote.002"/> Hence, this negated the political force of the merchant class, as they were individuals rather than an entity. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p2.13">Thus, they were not able to counter unjust rapacity by custom's officials. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p2.13">As Niels Steensgaard points out, 'the caravans [...] had to pass through many towns and countries, and everywhere the Turkish rulers demanded heavy duties over and above the customary ones'.<ref target="BAWE_0147a-ftnote.003"/> This culture of squeeze also affected the volume of trade going through Ottoman ports. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p2.13">For instance, after the establishment of the East India Company the British preferred to acquire pepper from India rather than from Ottoman ports as customs duties were approximately 'three times as high in near-eastern ports'.<ref target="BAWE_0147a-ftnote.004"/> Therefore, the inability by the central administration to regulate duty collection formed part of the grounds for a loss in transit trade. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p3.13">On another part, the discovery of the sea passage to Asia was a contributing factor to the decline of the transit trade. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p3.13">Yet, it was the subsequent Ottoman failure to realize the opportunity of sea-borne commercial expansion that led to the decrease of the trade flow. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p3.13">Although the Ottoman's were able to prevent the Portuguese from gaining maritime control the superior ships of the Dutch and English managed to gain firm dominion over the Indian Ocean.<ref target="BAWE_0147a-ftnote.005"/> In this way, the European navies with their newly developed frigate class, the <hi rend="italic">Bertone</hi>
<ref target="BAWE_0147a-ftnote.006"/>, were able to wrestle maritime control away from the Levant who could not scramble a navy powerful enough to counter the 'combined navies of the Christian Mediterranean states'.<ref target="BAWE_0147a-ftnote.007"/> Likewise, there was little protection on both the Black and Red Sea and this further discouraged trade that would have benefited the Empire. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p3.13">Hence, the administration was merely unable to control the trade flows on the oceans and were thus excluded from the benefits of far eastern trade. </s>

<s n="s2.3;p4.13">A Venetian Consul reports that although the Venetian transit trade was decreasing, "the trade in Aleppo is as flourishing as ever".<ref target="BAWE_0147a-ftnote.008"/> This increased trade manifested itself in the emergence of a large merchant class in trading centers. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p4.13">In this sense, Suraiya Faroqhi argues that in merchant cities such as Ankara and Bursa the internal trade 'led to a significant amount of social differentiation and capital accumulation'.<ref target="BAWE_0147a-ftnote.009"/> Furthermore, inter-province trade was complemented by the commercial relationship between the cities and their hinterland, which flourished especially during times of urban growth. <ref target="BAWE_0147a-ftnote.010"/> </s>

<s n="s1.3;p5.13">Unfortunately, there is scarce reliable data to suitably determine the various internal commercial links. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p5.13">Research into this area has long been 'overshadowed by the study of international maritime activities'.<ref target="BAWE_0147a-ftnote.011"/> In this way an orientalist view of the Ottomans as the <hi rend="italic">Other</hi> contributed to the neglect of the study of interior trade patterns. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p5.13">However, the very existence of tangible links illustrate that financial loss due to the diversion of transit trade could have easily been recovered through the adjustment of local economies to the domestic market.<ref target="BAWE_0147a-ftnote.012"/> In this fashion Steensgaard notes that it was 'the publicans and thieves who suffered the greatest losses [...] their investments could not so easily be transferred to other fields'.<ref target="BAWE_0147a-ftnote.013"/> Thus, the argument that the opening of the sea passage to Asia was a considerable cause of the decline of the Ottoman Empire is perhaps somewhat exaggerated. </s>

<s n="s3.4;p6.13">
<hi rend="italic">Timars</hi> were plots of land allocated to men who in return would provide military support to the Empire. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p6.13">Yet, irregular inflation began to affect many <hi rend="italic">timar</hi> holders who did not receive state supplements to their income.<ref target="BAWE_0147a-ftnote.014"/> Subsequently, many <hi rend="italic">timar</hi> plots were vacated and snatched up by administrative or palace officials, depriving the army of its backbone.<ref target="BAWE_0147a-ftnote.015"/> This shortage of soldiers was alleviated by the recruitment of <hi rend="italic">janissaries</hi>, who according to Andrina Stiles were undisciplined and resembled a part-time militia as opposed to a professional army.<ref target="BAWE_0147a-ftnote.016"/> Hence, an inefficient army that was ridden with corruption fostered instability within the Empire. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p7.13">The ineptitude of officials to regulate an army is mirrored in the civil service's propensity to corruption. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p7.13">Koja Beg's analysis succinctly summarizes this situation, "undeserving people can procure a fief or a salary by means of bribes [...and...] many who have been put down on the army pay lists simply draw their salaries without ever dreaming of serving in a war".<ref target="BAWE_0147a-ftnote.017"/> A good indicator for this is the amount of land that government lost to the private market. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p7.13">In 1610 royal land amounted to 9 per cent of the 1560 value. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p7.13">Land was taken up by officials and courtiers and thus the government lost a significant amount of revenue. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p7.13">Compounding this issue were the sultans of which the 'majority were incompetent, pleasure living spendthrifts, who no longer controlled government decisions'.<ref target="BAWE_0147a-ftnote.018"/> A society that is prone to corruption and furthermore lacks political authority is bound to disintegrate. </s>

<s n="s3.7;p8.13">Most taxes were levied in <hi rend="italic">akce</hi> and not in silver. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p8.13">Therefore in 1591 the central treasury income was only worth half of what it was in 1534.<ref target="BAWE_0147a-ftnote.019"/> This issue was compounded by a worldwide trend of inflation that Murat Cizakca terms as 'price revolution'.<ref target="BAWE_0147a-ftnote.020"/> The failure to implement required fiscal regulation to counter the silver threat and subsequent inflation is largely ascribed to the Ottoman mentality of supplying abundant commodities to the home market. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p8.13">This subjected the external trade of the empire to free trade by agreeing to numerous capitulations with Western powers.<ref target="BAWE_0147a-ftnote.021"/> This stood in contrast to the European mercantilist political economy of the time. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p8.13">Hence, the belief in economical self-regulation hindered the development of vital fiscal measures to control the effects of inflation. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p8.13">In the midst of this financial crisis the English Ambassador to Istanbul remarked that "as far as I can see, the Turkish Empire was in great decline, almost ruined". <ref target="BAWE_0147a-ftnote.022"/> </s>

<s n="s3.5;p9.13">Hence, advisors and commentators 'were hampered by the tenets of High Islam, which bound them to the circle of equity hypothesis and restricted their suggestions for action almost entirely to the traditional approach'.<ref target="BAWE_0147a-ftnote.023"/> In this way, the decline was remarked upon in scholarship. </s>
