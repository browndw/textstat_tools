<s n="s2.6;p3.11">In order to avoid this, small firms often obtain finance from the entrepreneur's own capital and informal investors, such as family and friends. </s>

<s n="s4.6;p3.11">Alternatively, small firms may look at retail or 'high street' banking, which is a source of debt finance targeted at providing "investment capital to new startups and expanding small firms"<ref target="BAWE_0271b-ftnote.004"/>. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p3.11">However, banks are less willing to give out bank loans to small firms due to the higher risk of non-repayment. </s>
