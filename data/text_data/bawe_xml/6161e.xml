<div2>
<head rend="underlined">Electrical Generator Performance. </head>
<p n="p22.35">
<s n="s1.4;p22.35">(Figure 5) shows that each series of Voltages from our recorded data roughly follow the form of a general Cp / λ curve. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p22.35">The optimal position of the curve for this turbine cannot be accurately plotted. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p22.35">Some voltages at different wind speeds lie outside of an ideal Cp / λ curve, this could indicate that these combinations of Voltage and wind speed are not as efficient in producing electrical power as those values that lie closer to the Cp / λ curve. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p22.35">The peak Coefficient of Performance value of 0.0028 (fig.5) was obtained when the turbine was rotating at 870 RPM in 11.63m/s of wind generating 0.92 amps at 12.5V producing 11.5 Watts. </s>
</p>
<p n="p23.35">
<s n="s1.8;p23.35">(Figure 7) shows that voltages as low as 2.5V could be generated over a range of speeds of rotation from as low as 250rpm upwards, though at 250rpm the generator could only generate 0.4 Amps. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p23.35">To generate more current at these low voltages we needed to increase the speed of rotation, for example 2.5 Amps at 750rpm. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p23.35">This was achieved by increasing the wind speed. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p23.35">Higher voltages were generated at higher speeds of rotation too. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p23.35">For example 20V was only generated above 1000rpm and at this rotation speed the current was only 0.2 Amps. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p23.35">To generate more current at 20V we needed to increase the speed of rotation above 1000rpm, again by increasing the wind speed. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p23.35">As we increase the wind speed velocity the current supplied to the load increased, the rate of rotation increased but the voltage decreased. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p23.35">The relationship between Current (I) and the speed of rotation (rpm) when drawing different loads at the same voltages clearly appears to simultaneously increase in linear fashion. </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="underlined">Torque Performance</head>
<p n="p24.35">
<s n="s1.2;p24.35">(Figure 6) shows clearly that at each fixed wind speed (DP) the speed of turbine rotation increases as the Voltage supplied to the load increases, it is the current supplied to the load that varies. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p24.35">For example when the difference in pressure (∆p) value was either 133,188 or 253, and the voltage supplied to the load was between 2.5 &amp; 5V the current supplied to the load increased slightly before decreasing at Voltages above 5V. When the (∆p) value was either 90 or 363, and the voltage supplied to the load was between 2.5 &amp; 5V the current supplied to the load remained the same, before decreasing at Voltages above 5V. At (∆p) values above 441, the current supplied to the load decreased at each Voltage increase. </s>
</p>
<p n="p25.35">
<s n="s1.7;p25.35">Although there are these minor variations, <hi rend="underlined">the general trend is that at each wind speed (∆p), as the Voltage supplied to the load increases, so the rate of rotation increases, but the current supplied to the load decreases.</hi> </s>
<s n="s2.7;p25.35">Figure 4 shows that at a wind velocity of 10m/s (or equivalent ∆p of 13.71) at 15V we generated 0.43Amps so the resistance was 34 ohms. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p25.35">Increasing the voltage to 17.5V and we generated 0.3Amps but the resistance increased to 58 ohms. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p25.35">This is because we are demanding more energy from the generator by increasing the resistance at the load. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p25.35">Increasing resistance means less current can be delivered to the load. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p25.35">The only way to generate an increased current at higher voltages is to increase the wind speed hence increasing the available Kinetic energy. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p25.35">This proves that there is only so much energy we can extract from the wind at any particular velocity before both the torque and performance coefficient decreases. </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="underlined">Maximum Power Output Comparison</head>
<p n="p26.35">
<s n="s1.4;p26.35">The maximum power output in Amps was plotted against the wind speed (fig.8) where wind speed was converted into knots for comparison against the manufacturer's performance specification graph (fig.9). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p26.35">The trend line generated from our data plots suggests that our best power output in Amps for every wind speed was in fact lower than that suggested by the manufacturer. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p26.35">For example we were generating 1 Amp at 20 knots, where the manufacturer claims the turbine would do this at 15 knots. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p26.35">Likewise at almost 30 knots we generated 2.5 Amps whereas the manufacturer suggests we should generate 3.7 Amps. </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="underlined">A more realistic Cp / λ curve ? </head>
<p n="p27.35">
<s n="s1.5;p27.35">In our mathematical equations we worked out the coefficient of performance (Cp) and the Tip speed Ratio (λ), using the square root difference in pressure (√∆p) as the wind velocity as the velocity 'V' is proportional to √∆p. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p27.35">We assumed using the Continuity Equation (A <hi rend="sub">1</hi>V <hi rend="sub">1</hi> = A <hi rend="sub">2</hi>V <hi rend="sub">2)</hi> that the wind velocity at the turbine (V <hi rend="sub">2</hi>) was equal to the Velocity inside the working section of the tunnel (V <hi rend="sub">1</hi>) where our pitot-static measurements (∆p) were taken. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p27.35">The area inside the working section (A <hi rend="sub">1</hi>) was 305 x 305mm = 93,025 mm <hi rend="sup">2.</hi> </s>
<s n="s4.5;p27.35">The cross sectional area at the turbine (V <hi rend="sub">2</hi>) could not be measured as the turbine was in a position outside of the tunnel in free air. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p27.35">Therefore because A <hi rend="sub">2</hi> could not be measured the continuity equation would not work. </s>
</p>
<p n="p28.35">
<s n="s1.1;p28.35">If equations were recalculated substituting √∆p with the true measured wind velocity at the face in front of the turbine, then our plots may have compared better to the manufacturers specification as shown in (fig.9). </s>
</p>
<p n="p29.35">
<s n="s1.4;p29.35">Interestingly if we substitute √∆p with the true velocity when plotting our Cp / λ Curves (fig.5), the Coefficient of Performance gets much better with a peak Cp value going from 0.0028 at 870 RPM, 0.92 amps at 12.5V generating 11.5 Watts (fig.5), to 0.0074 (fig.10). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p29.35">This proves that by increasing the wind speed we get a higher Cp value, a higher proportion of energy extracted at the blades. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p29.35">The individual Voltage Cp / λ curve plots (fig.10) also display a more chaotic nature than those smoother forms seen on our original (fig.5). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p29.35">This in essence could be caused by the true disturbed variable wind velocities the turbine was experiencing (fig.11), due to turbulent flow mixing in the tunnel exhaust. </s>

<s n="s3.4;p31.35">The jet of air leaving the nozzle would entrain with the air outside causing it to slow and mix via turbulent wind eddies. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p31.35">Although the jet is likely to have expanded to a larger diameter over the distance between the nozzle and the turbine to effectively influence the whole swept area, turbulent eddies within the flow could explain varying wind velocities measured across the face of the blades (fig.11). </s>
