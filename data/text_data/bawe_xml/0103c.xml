</p>
<p n="p4.49">
<s n="s1.1;p4.49">The freshwater turtles survive by entering a comatose-like state due to a radical repression of the brain's activity and by buffering any lactate and sequestering it in the shell. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.49">
<s n="s1.1;p5.49">As for <hi rend="italic">Hemiscyllium ocellatum</hi> sp, it survives at elevated temperatures and protects itself from any neuronal damage by increasing nitric oxide synthase production. </s>

<p n="p6.49">
<s n="s1.2;p6.49">These mechanisms appear to have evolved several times and separately. </s>

<s n="s2.5;p8.49">Brain cells are extremely sensitive to oxygen deprivation, even though there is an adequate blood flow (<seg type="URL" n="http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/anoxia/anoxia.htm"/>). </s>
<s n="s3.5;p8.49">This condition refers to cerebral hypoxia also known as cerebral anoxia. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p8.49">This can result from, for example, carbon monoxide poisoning, head trauma, choking, but the most common occurrence is being under water, which greatly increases the possibility of encountering anoxia (<seg type="URL" n="http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/anoxia/anoxia.htm"/>). </s>
<s n="s5.5;p8.49">This is primarily because water can hold much less oxygen than air, and its diffusion rate is only about 1/10000 of that in air (Nilsson and Renshaw, 2004). </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.49">
<s n="s1.3;p9.49">However, there are a few aquatic vertebrates that have evolved to become hypoxia tolerant. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p9.49">The study of these vertebrates is of great importance for non-anoxia tolerant mammalians, especially humans and can lead to the prevention and treatment of this condition. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p9.49">This study focuses on one question: how do these vertebrates survive anoxia and avoid brain damage? </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.49">
<s n="s1.2;p10.49">In this essay three species that have evolved adaptive mechanism for dealing with anoxia will be reviewed: the Crucian carp, the freshwater turtles and finally the epaulette shark. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p10.49">They all appear to survive anoxia via different mechanisms and they will each be discussed along with their survival scheme in order to answer the question asked above. </s>

<p n="p12.49">
<s n="s1.1;p12.49">The survival of this aquatic vertebrate during those conditions relies on its adaptation to the environment at 3 different levels. </s>
</p>
<div3>
<head rend="underlined">The physiological adjustment of the Crucian carp in response to cerebral anoxia</head>
<p n="p13.49">
<s n="s1.2;p13.49">One of the most important factors in the physiological adjustment of the carp during anoxia is its capacity to acquire the little oxygen that is present in oxygen defiant water due to its extreme high affinity for oxygen. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p13.49">Its haemoglobin is 50% saturated at an oxygen partial pressure (<hi rend="italic">P</hi>O <hi rend="sub">2</hi>) of 0.34 kPA (2.6 mmHg), allowing it to maintain its routine rate of oxygen consumption down to water oxygen level of 5-10% of air saturation (Nilsson and Lutz, 2004; Nilsson and Renshaw, 2004 ) </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.49">
<s n="s1.2;p14.49">In addition, when exposed to anoxia, it can change the morphology of its gills to increase its respiratory surface area. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p14.49">This is achieved by the apoptotic death of cells covering much of the lamellar surface during normal conditions, resulting in its protrusion (Nilsson and Lutz, 2004; Nilsson and Renshaw, 2004) </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.49">
<s n="s1.1;p15.49">Other minor adjustments but worth mentioning appear to be the temporal blindness and deafness of the carp as a result of the activities auditory nerves and of those involved in vision being strongly suppressed (the reason for this will be discussed in part C). </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.49">
<s n="s1.1;p16.49">These adaptations are minor compared to the process by which the Crucian carp prevents the damage of the brain and insures it survival through a strategy involving glycolytic activation. </s>
</p>
</div3>

<head rend="underlined">Glycolytic activation of <hi rend="italic">Carassius sp</hi>

</p>
<p n="p18.49">
<s n="s1.5;p18.49">mainly associated with the control of ion pumps when needed to sustain the electrical activity of the brain. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p18.49">The carp must be able to match ATP consumption with ATP production in the absence of oxygen thereby avoiding energy failure and accumulations of high concentrations of potassium leading to the depolarization of the neuron. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p18.49">The net result of this is the activation of degenerative and lytic processes involving the degradation of DNA, proteins and the cell membrane itself by lytic enzymes, free radicals and nitric oxide (Nilsson, 2004). </s>
<s n="s4.5;p18.49">The Crucian carp avoids this catastrophe by using glycolysis to make ATP. Since glycolysis yields 2 mol ATP/ mol glucose (in contrast to the production of ATP by aerobic metabolism which yields 36 mol ATP/mol glucose), the carp maintains ATP level by increasing the rate of glycolysis. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p18.49">Glucose is the only cellular fuel that can be used by the brain (Nilsson and Renshaw, 2004). </s>
</p>
<p n="p19.49">
<s n="s1.12;p19.49">At the commencement of anoxia, the organism undergoes glycolysis to produce extra large glucose stores that can be utilized later on. </s>
<s n="s2.12;p19.49">The carp starts producing ethanol as the major end product of anaerobic glycolysis (instead of lactate as in other vertebrates) (Nilsson and Lutz, 1997; Nilsson, 2001). </s>
<s rend="italic" n="s3.12;p19.49">Carassius sp. </s>
<s n="s4.12;p19.49">utilizes this glycolytic strategy to avoid the problem of self-intoxication and the high lactate levels and consequent acidosis faced by other vertebrates (Nilsson and Lutz, 1997). </s>
<s n="s5.12;p19.49">The main steps in this conversion of glucose into ethanol are the transformation of pyruvate into acetaldehyde in a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase, also releasing CO <hi rend="sub">2</hi> . </s>
<s n="s6.12;p19.49">Acetaldehyde slips out of the mitochondrion rather than being converted to acetyl CoA (in contrast with other vertebrates). </s>
<s n="s7.12;p19.49">It is finally converted into ethanol by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). </s>
<s n="s8.12;p19.49">This enzyme is found at extraordinary high levels in skeletal muscles. </s>
<s n="s9.12;p19.49">Although ADH is predominant in this part of the body, the <hi rend="italic">Carassius sp</hi>. brain lacks it and so the brain releases lactate as the end product of the glycolytic pathway. </s>
<s n="s10.12;p19.49">It is then translocated to the muscles via the blood where it is transformed to ethanol and CO <hi rend="sub">2</hi> . </s>
<s n="s11.12;p19.49">The ethanol then leaves the organism by spreading over the gill membrane (Nilsson and Lutz, 1997; Nilsson, 2001; Nilsson and Lutz, 2004). </s>

<p n="p20.49">
<s n="s1.2;p20.49">The obvious advantage of this system is that the organism has tolerable steady-state levels of lactate and ethanol and it still swims, in other words it is still active although its activity is reduced. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p20.49">And it can survive until it supply of glycogen stores is depleted, making its life expectancy high during the Nordic winter (Nilsson, 2004; Nilsson, 2001) However the unfortunate drawback of this system for the organism is the loss of high energy carbohydrate (Nilsson and Lutz, 2004) </s>
</p>
<p n="p21.49">

<p n="p22.49">
<s n="s1.2;p22.49">During anoxic conditions, the animal's activity is reduced as mentioned above but not shutdown. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p22.49">The reduction of the electric activity (which accounts for more than 50% of neural energy consumption in vertebrates) contributing to a reduction in ATP consumption is believed to rely on 3 principle neurotransmitters and neuromodulators: </s>
</p>
<p n="p23.49">
<s n="s1.2;p23.49">Microdialysis measurements have shown that γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a mediator of survival in the brain of the organism (Nilsson, 2001; Nilsson and Lutz, 2004). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p23.49">This neurotransmitter inhibits transmission in the brain and it is released in the Crucian carp at moderated levels to reduce neuronal activity such that ATP consumption is reduced but the organism maintains a certain level of activity. </s>
</p>
<p n="p24.49">
<s n="s1.3;p24.49">The second neurotransmitter that takes part is glutamate. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p24.49">It appears that this major neurotransmitter in mammals and fish during normoxia, is highly toxic in the anoxic brain. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p24.49">The Carp avoids this anoxic exitotoxin by reducing its release (Nilsson and Lutz, 1997; Nilsson and Renshaw, 2004). </s>
</p>
<p n="p25.49">
<s n="s1.3;p25.49">Finally adenosine appears to play an important role in neuromodulation of the Carp brain. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p25.49">This has been proven by blocking adenosine receptors which leads to the increase in the rate of ethanol release to the water (Nilsson, 2001). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p25.49">Being the result of the net breakdown of phosphorylated adenylates (such as ATP, AMP and ADP), it acts to produce an increase in cerebral blood, inhibit neuronal activity and release of excitatory neurotransmitters (Nilsson and Lutz, 1997) </s>
</p>
<p n="p26.49">
<s n="s1.5;p26.49">As a consequence of metabolic depression, Na+/K+ ATPase (which is used to restore ion-gradients constantly disrupted by electrical activity) is also reduced (Johansson <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>, 1997). </s>
<s n="s2.5;p26.49">The Crucian carp also maintains a low extra-cellular K+ levels and any harmful rises in intracellular Ca2+ are avoided. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p26.49">It is also believed that the voltage gated channels of those in have reduced permeability but experiments have so far given negative results for this supposition (Nilsson, 2001; Nilsson, and Lutz, 2004). </s>
<s n="s4.5;p26.49">These reductions appear to be a second line of defence (Nilsson, 2001). </s>

<p n="p29.49">
<s n="s1.4;p29.49">As mentioned above, the freshwater turtles clearly differ from the Crucian carp in that of the drastic suppression of the use of ATP (Jackson, 1999). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p29.49">First, the turtle is an ectotherm (cold blooded animal) and it therefore has a metabolic rate that is low compared to an endotherm of similar size (five to ten times lower even at the same temperature). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p29.49">This facilitates the transition to anaerobic metabolism and the drastic suppression of electric activity. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p29.49">ATP consumption is lowered to such a degree that brain energy needs are met by anaerobic glycolysis (Jackson, 1999) this will be further discussed in part B. </s>
</p>
<p n="p30.49">
<s n="s1.8;p30.49">More than 50% of brain ATP used to maintain ion gradient is reduced by reducing ion flux. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p30.49">This is achieved through a decrease in ion permeability and it is termed channel arrest (Nilsson and Lutz, 1997): in the first hours of anoxia, extracellular potassium flux is reduced by about 50% and this is mediate by the K <hi rend="sub">ATP</hi> channels and activated adenosine A <hi rend="sub">1</hi> receptors. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p30.49">The voltage gated Na+ channels are 42% decreased and this mediates the elevation in the action potential threshold causing "spike arrest" (Nilsson and Lutz, 1997; Jackson, 1999). </s>
<s n="s4.8;p30.49">Also contributing to spike arrest is the extreme increased levels of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA which silences much of the brain activity accompanied by an increase in GABA <hi rend="sub">A</hi> receptor numbers. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p30.49">On the other hand extracellular glutamate is suppressed. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p30.49">Not only because it happens to be very toxic during anoxia, but also because its synthesis (and the breakdown of GABA) is an oxygen dependent process and will therefore stop during anoxia (and GABA breakdown will halt) (Nilsson and Lutz, 1997; Jackson, 1999). </s>

<s n="s1.3;p48.49">Maybe a combination of an aspect of each strategies could be the solution. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p48.49">For example the freshwater turtles have their neuronal activity also controlled by many molecular factors such as heat shock proteins (Hsp), HIF-1 alpha mRNA and NF-kappaB also found to play a major role in coordinating many adaptive response to hypoxia (the former) and a delayed defence mechanism to prevent reoxygenation reactive oxygen species (ROS) damage and initial apoptosis in mammals (Nilsson and Lutz, 2004). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p48.49">And so this combined to the fact that the epaulette shark survives anoxia at 25-30 C (normal room temperature) may be an important step further to treatment. </s>
