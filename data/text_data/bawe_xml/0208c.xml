<s n="s2.5;p1.24">Created in 1972 and still led by Jean Marie Le Pen, many attribute the party's success single-handedly to his personality and powerful oratory skills. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p1.24">While both Left-wing and Right-wing parties hover closer and closer to middle-ground, the FN takes radical stances on sensitive yet pertinent issues, which politicians frequently steer clear off to avoid controversy. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p1.24">However, the party's success can't be individually credited to its influential leader, its radical policies or to a failure from previous Left and Right-Wing governments; an amalgamation of factors combined with the right timing and social context created the right setting for the Front National's emergence. </s>

<s n="s2.3;p2.24">By strategically portraying themselves as the 'alternative' party to a dissatisfied electorate, the FN amassed support from those frustrated with the current government. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p2.24">Much of this discontent was due to Mitterrand's numerous failed policies and the ever-thinning dividing line between Left and Right-wing parties. </s>
</p>
<note place="foot" id="BAWE_0208c-ftnote.001">
<p n="pn1.1">

<s n="s1.5;p3.24">Mitterrand entered the presidential office replete with ideas for social reforms, however, these proved very costly and placed a heavy burden on the national economy. </s>

<s n="s3.5;p3.24">The taxation policies imposed by the Socialist leader had a further detrimental effect in the economy. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p3.24">The income and wealth taxation increases triggered a great deal of capital flight, putting yet another damper on economic activity. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p3.24">Roussel (1985) is particularly keen on attributing the arrival of the FN on the political scene to this exasperation with the Socialist government, and to the system of proportional representation imposed by it, which allowed smaller and new parties to gain access to the National Assembly. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.24">
<s n="s1.3;p4.24">However, the extent of the Socialists' failure in implementing their policies was greatly magnified by external factors, like the inopportune recession which struck the whole of Europe. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p4.24">Europe entered a period of economic stagnation, pushing unemployment to very high levels<ref target="BAWE_0208c-ftnote.002"/>, causing a stalling of export demand, and shrinking the domestic demand - all consequently leading to a slow down of the economy. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p4.24">Plenel and Rollat (1984) argue that this recession, largely driven by the 1970s oil shocks, is greatly responsible for the public's frustration<ref target="BAWE_0208c-ftnote.003"/> with the government and for the expansion of the support for the FN. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p5.24">Whether this initial success was a direct result of government incompetence or of the economic climate at the time, Le Pen undoubtedly knew how to best promote his party. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p5.24">He is considered by Lorien, Citron and Dumont (1986) to have had a central role in the growth in prominence of the party, due to his strong personality, his eloquence and persuasive public speaking ability. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p5.24">Le Pen was also well aware of the French people's affinity to their past, the historic notion of French grandeur and the urge to restore France's position as a powerful nation on the world stage. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p5.24">The FN appealed to this national pride, calling for the restoration of "France's unique place in Europe and in the world"<ref target="BAWE_0208c-ftnote.004"/>. </s>

</p>
<p n="p7.24">
<s n="s1.6;p7.24">Many also claim that the immense coverage given to Le Pen by the media also worked to the benefit of the FN. Through it, Le Pen exposed the party's vision nation-wide, capturing the audience with his intense and compelling speeches, many of which played on the current fears of the French. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p7.24">Clever promotional videos overflowing with subtleties and symbolism were created, making full use of the media to extend the FN's reach. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p7.24">These types of political devices were not swiftly adopted by the other parties, who failed to perceive the impact of these developments in modern politics and their persuasive power over the popular vote. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p7.24">The FN delighted in this coverage, allowing its every move to be covered by the national press, and received more than enough exposure. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p7.24">However, this raises the question of whether all press coverage, both positive and negative, was in fact beneficial to the party. </s>

<p n="p8.24">
<s n="s1.5;p8.24">There is an undeniable correlation between the timing of the strong stances on controversial issues taken by the FN, and the party's popularity; this is clearly reflected in people' voting intentions, shown in Table 1. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p8.24">This begins to answer the question set out above, of whether the ample press coverage was advantageous to the FN. It appears that in fact, this has caused as much damage as healing to the party's image. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p8.24">One can draw from this voting volatility that perhaps FN votes aren't representative of a full or consistent support for the party's set of policies, or of a particular wish to see the party in power. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p8.24">Many argue that a great part of the FN votes are in fact impulsive 'protest votes', tending to be more against the incumbent government than in favor of the FN. This view credits the other mainstream parties and previous governments with a great deal of responsibility for the rise of the FN. It discards the notion of the 1984 European Election results as being representative of a widespread support for the FN, defending that people voted free of party affiliation. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p8.24">The argument is that this was a result of people's perception of the European Election as being unimportant in the determination of domestic policies, which affect their lives more directly, leaving people free to express their dissatisfaction by casting their anti-government vote. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p9.24">There are convincing arguments for both attributing these oscillations in voting intentions to a dissatisfaction with the government and to an actual identification with the FN's positions; and because these two arguments are not mutually exclusive, it can be suggested that they may have contributed jointly to the swaying of the voting intentions portrayed above. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p9.24">The FN's strong stance on the Islamic headscarf issue in November 1989, is a good example of this. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p9.24">Such results can be interpreted as a strong identification with the concerns raised by the FN leader and also a disapproval of Mitterrand's Socialist government, which failed to take a decisive position on the issue. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p9.24">Le Pen openly criticized mainstream parties for not assuming a clear position on the issue and for favoring the growing immigrant population, relying greatly on the media frenzy to spread his word. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p21.24">All this perhaps explains the sizable number of abstentions in the first round of the 2002 elections by reflecting the causes for the indifference on the part of the French population. </s>

<s n="s2.3;p23.24">This ability to transform and re-invent has helped the FN to detangle themselves from past mistakes of the extreme right, and to modernize. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p23.24">Recent examples include Le Pen's quasi-partnership with the national media, and his clever use of these means to reach a large population, leaving the traditional mainstream parties behind. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p24.24">No doubt a large opportunity was left for the FN to enter the political realm by past failures of the mainstream parties, but the FN undoubtedly recognized what the French population wanted and used this to their favour. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p24.24">These policies were then clearly and persuasively voiced by Le Pen. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p24.24">His strong leadership, charisma, impressive oratory skills, appealed to people and amassed support in various areas throughout France. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p24.24">Despite the many failures of the mainstream political parties in France, and the obvious conclusion that would be to attribute all the blame to their shortcomings, this would paint an incomplete picture. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p24.24">It appears as if though the FN's success might have been possible without the failure to some extent of the mainstream political parties, this certainly would have been on a much smaller scale. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p24.24">In order to understand the reasoning behind the FN's uprising, we must accept that their success was a result of a complex interaction between many factors, and that these reacted together as catalysts to bring about the unexpected success that the FN has had in the past decades. </s>
