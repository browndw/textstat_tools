<s n="s1.9;p1.15">Environmental law and policy without a doubt affects every citizen of the European Union. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p1.15">Environmental issues inevitably transcend national boundaries, for instance regarding river pollution, acid rain or global warming. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p1.15">Therefore, the European Union has gradually formed its own body of environmental law and policy, which arguably has more than merely a symbolic function. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p1.15">Indeed, around 80%<ref target="BAWE_0315e-ftnote.001"/> of UK environmental law derives from the EC, generally by way of directives. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p1.15">However, the evolution of EC environmental law and policy has not been a smooth journey. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p1.15">Many euro-sceptics feel that the "regulatory rather than redistributive"<ref target="BAWE_0315e-ftnote.002"/> nature of EC environmental law and policy represents a fundamental loss of national control. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p1.15">There is a central tension between the furtherance of the Community's economic aims and environmental protection. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p1.15">Nevertheless, Lord Clinton-Davis claims that "environmental policy has been one of the great success stories of the Union"<ref target="BAWE_0315e-ftnote.003"/>. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p1.15">This could be a pre-emptive judgement, given the feared ignorance of environmental issues amongst the ten new member states. </s>

<p n="p2.15">
<s n="s1.9;p2.15">At the outset of European integration, namely the Treaty of Rome of 1957, the priority for the member states was maintaining peace following the destruction from World War Two. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p2.15">The means to this end was economic integration and the creation of a common market. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p2.15">Thus, all legislation in the period up to 1972 had solely economic underpinnings. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p2.15">Appearances can be deceptive, for example the 1967 Directive on Classification, Packaging and Labelling of Dangerous Substances<ref target="BAWE_0315e-ftnote.004"/> was not aimed specifically at protecting the environment. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p2.15">The Community's attitude to environmental protection at this time can be described as "incidental", and "inarticulate"<ref target="BAWE_0315e-ftnote.005"/>. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p2.15">It was not until the UN Stockholm conference in 1972 that international cooperation on environmental matters began to take shape. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p2.15">This was shortly followed by the Paris summit, in which the Community declared that "economic expansion is not an end in itself"<ref target="BAWE_0315e-ftnote.006"/>. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p2.15">Such an assertion proved instrumental in the evolution of EC environmental law. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p2.15">In order for a credible environmental strategy to develop, it is essential that it is developed in conjunction with economic goals and not subsidiary to them. </s>

<head rend="italic">Approximation of laws</head>
<p n="p3.15">
<s n="s1.7;p3.15">The first EC environmental measures were founded on the premise of the approximation of laws. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p3.15">This was achieved under Articles 94 and 308 EC and is an example of the Commission flexing its interventionist muscles. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p3.15">Article 94 provides for measures that secure the harmonisation of laws affecting the common market, such as the Directive on the lead content of petrol<ref target="BAWE_0315e-ftnote.007"/>. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p3.15">The rationale is that differing environmental standards distorts competition, thus jeopardising the efficacy of the common market. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p3.15">Industrialists would have to spend more in some states to meet their higher standards. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p3.15">Article 308 is a residual power where it is "necessary to attain, in the course of the operation of the common market, one of the objectives of the Community"<ref target="BAWE_0315e-ftnote.008"/>, for instance the Directive on Conservation of Wild Birds<ref target="BAWE_0315e-ftnote.009"/>. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p3.15">Again, the focus is on the common market and this led to directives being introduced in a largely ad-hoc fashion and this left the Community without a coherent environmental policy. </s>

<head rend="italic">Post-SEA developments</head>
<p n="p4.15">
<s n="s1.10;p4.15">A major turning point came following the ratification of the Single European Act (SEA) in 1986. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p4.15">This provided a legal basis for the introduction of new EC environmental legislation and "the objectives of the Community's environment policy were enshrined in the Treaty"<ref target="BAWE_0315e-ftnote.010"/>. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p4.15">The Maastricht Treaty (TEU) added the environment to Articles 2 and 3 of the EC Treaty. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p4.15">Following TEU, decisions on the environment are made by way of qualified majority voting coupled with the co-decision procedure, which makes the decision-making process easier and gives a more prominent role to the European Parliament. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p4.15">This represents a fundamental shift in the balance of power underpinning the legal order. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p4.15">Before, the member states could protect national environmental interests by way of their vetoes. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p4.15">Conversely, the increased role of the EP allows for pressure from Green MEPs to influence new legislation. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p4.15">Furthermore, TEU improved Article 2, which now refers to "a high level of protection and improvement of the quality of the environment"<ref target="BAWE_0315e-ftnote.011"/>. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p4.15">By virtue of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the environment is included in Article 6, requiring environmental considerations to be integrated into every aspect of Community Law and Policy. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p4.15">The post-SEA developments mean that the EC has intentionally articulated a desire to pursue sustainable development whilst respecting the environment. </s>

<s n="s2.6;p5.15">This has been defined as to "take action where the science is not clear, but where there is reasonable cause for concern"<ref target="BAWE_0315e-ftnote.012"/>. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p5.15">This appears a vague concept and there is further ambiguity surrounding the revised Article 2, as it is unclear what exactly is meant by a "high level of protection". </s>
<s n="s4.6;p5.15">Similarly, the EC is drifting away from traditional command and control regulation in favour of more proactive policy instruments, such as target standards and tradable permits. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p5.15">There has been an acknowledgement that command and control is not always cost effective as it promotes a perhaps unnecessarily high level of uniformity. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p5.15">Furthermore, the European Commission has modernised its outlook and is relying more on expert advice, such as from the European Environment Agency. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p7.15">The first was published in 1973 and set out 11 principles on which Community environmental policy is based. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p7.15">The second, third and fourth concentrated mainly on emission limits and targets, which reflects the type of regulatory directive being created at this time. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p7.15">The fifth action programme mirrors the new types of policy instruments mentioned above and typifies the modern approach to environmental protection. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p7.15">It is drawn up on the principles of sustainable development, preventive and precautionary action and shared responsibility. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p7.15">The sixth programme, which covers the period 2000-2005, builds on this bottom-up approach. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p7.15">It projects more accountability, public awareness and self-regulation, for example through voluntary participation in eco-management audit scheme. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p7.15">At the same time, it has not lost sight of its core priorities, namely climate change and the sustainable use of resources. </s>

<s n="s1.14;p8.15">The Action Programmes and the improvements to the Treaty make promising reading for the environmentalist. </s>
<s n="s2.14;p8.15">However, underlying the evolution of EC environmental law is a fundamental inconsistency between promoting economic growth and protecting the environment. </s>
<s n="s3.14;p8.15">One of the fundamental aims of the EU is to secure and promote the competitiveness of industries operating within the umbrella of the common market. </s>
<s n="s4.14;p8.15">In addition, environmental protection is sometimes sidelined by the principle of the free movement of goods. </s>
<s n="s5.14;p8.15">Environmental measures, especially when a member state imposes more stringent standards than in a Directive, can fall foul of Article 28. </s>
<s n="s6.14;p8.15">This can be illustrated by <hi rend="italic">Aher-Waggon GmbH</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Danish Bottles</hi> case. </s>
<s n="s7.14;p8.15">It is certain nonetheless that environmental protection cannot be left to market forces as "competition tends to stimulate increased production"<ref target="BAWE_0315e-ftnote.014"/>. </s>
<s n="s8.14;p8.15">The member states have broadly accepted that adverse effects on competition must often be outweighed by environmental concerns. </s>
<s n="s9.14;p8.15">It is now the case that "Community Law must be applied with regard not only to the economic, but also to the environmental objectives of the Treaty"<ref target="BAWE_0315e-ftnote.015"/>. </s>
<s n="s10.14;p8.15">Although all the objectives of the Community are supposed to carry equal weight, it is generally accepted that the most pressing issue for most EU citizens nowadays is the economy. </s>
<s n="s11.14;p8.15">Therefore, the Commission has reached a compromise by increasingly using economic instruments such as subsidies and taxes to promote environmental protection. </s>
<s n="s12.14;p8.15">However, it can be argued that the use of state aid and subsidies to help certain countries meet their target standards undermines the principle of a harmonised common market. </s>
<s n="s13.14;p8.15">In <hi rend="italic">Walloon Waste,</hi> the Court of Justice said that "a choice has to be made between competing interests such as economic gains and environmental protection". </s>

<s n="s3.5;p10.15">It appears that the ECJ was politically motivated by a policy to promote environmental protection, although it must be remembered that such exemptions only apply in the absence of Community measures on the subject. </s>

<s n="s2.7;p13.15">Directives are "flexible means of ensuring harmonised standards"<ref target="BAWE_0315e-ftnote.021"/>, where flexible is the operative word. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p13.15">They are often vague, such as the Bathing Water Directive<ref target="BAWE_0315e-ftnote.022"/>, which led to some member states failing to submit poor quality sites for inspection. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p13.15">Some member states fail to implement some directives at all, for instance the Commission brought a direct action against the UK for non-implementation of the Drinking Water Directive<ref target="BAWE_0315e-ftnote.023"/>. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p13.15">Another difficulty centres on enforcement. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p13.15">Member states do not want Commission enforcement officers usurping the role of their own Environment Agencies. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p13.15">Indeed, the disparities between member states' procedures support the conclusion that "the implementation and enforcement of environmental legislation remains the weakest link in EU environmental policy"<ref target="BAWE_0315e-ftnote.024"/>. </s>

<s n="s1.10;p15.15">To conclude, EC environmental law and policy has undergone sweeping changes in the past 50 years. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p15.15">However, there still appears to be a lack of overall policy coherence, underpinned by a shifting agenda and the early ad hoc evolution. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p15.15">A turning point came in 1986 with the Single European Act, but the real reason behind the change in outlook was an increased global awareness of environmental issues. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p15.15">It is highly likely that the disaster at Chernobyl and the Sandoz chemical spill into the Rhine in 1986 were the real catalysts for action. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p15.15">It is interesting to conclude by considering how EC environmental law and policy evolved to its current integrated stage. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p15.15">Functionalists would argue that integration has its own internal dynamic, which spreads co-operation through all policy areas. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p15.15">Yet, the environment is not yet fully integrated into the spirit of the EU, in spite of Article 6 of the Treaty. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p15.15">Moreover, the "patchwork character"<ref target="BAWE_0315e-ftnote.029"/> of EC environmental law can be best explained by shortcomings in its implementation. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p15.15">Furthermore, the incongruity still exists between economic growth and environmental protection. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p15.15">In any case, a truly successful EC environmental policy can only be reached once each of the 25 member states acknowledges and fulfils its role in the "shared responsibility"<ref target="BAWE_0315e-ftnote.030"/> for protecting the environment. </s>
