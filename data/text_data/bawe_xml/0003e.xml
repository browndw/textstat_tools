<s n="s4.5;p4.15">Hence, when the Nazis, in 1943, unveiled a mass grave of 15,000 Polish officers at Katyn, murdered upon Stalin's orders, he denied all allegation and seized the opportunity to break diplomatic relations with the Polish government-in-exile upon inquiries from President Sikorski. </s>
