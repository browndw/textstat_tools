<s n="s2.3;p22.24">We must believe that for a man to be entirely without virtue is certainly possible, and that man would not be pursuing his <hi rend="italic">telos</hi> and thereby not performing his function. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p22.24">Whether one could deliberately not choose to pursue one's own good is another matter, since the notion of doing it on purpose implies deliberation and therefore <hi rend="italic">phronesis</hi>, albeit badly, even peculiarly, directed. </s>

<hi rend="italic">Phronesis</hi> is that which man uses to pursue his function: living well in accordance with his form, as a creature possessing reason. </s>
<s n="s4.11;p23.24">However, given that man's end - <hi rend="italic">telos -</hi> is not realisable, but forever advancing before him, the exercise of <hi rend="italic">phronesis</hi> is an organic process whereby the capacity is developed and refined. </s>
<s n="s5.11;p23.24">The ideal, the end, is not a part of this picture except in so far as it motivates the process of becoming that the ethical life consists in. </s>
<s n="s6.11;p23.24">
<hi rend="italic">Phronesis</hi> is thus self-regarding as well as being directed towards ethical life and hence others. </s>

<s n="s4.9;p24.24">We also saw that although man's possession of reason allows him to think the possibility of not pursuing his good, his end, the location of man's function in the exercise of practical reason makes it difficult to conceive of man making a choice to avoid his own good, given that that exercise of choice about man's relation to the world is dependent upon man's possession of <hi rend="italic">phronesis</hi>. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p24.24">Only the man denied any practical reason by nature could fail to live the ethical life, to live towards the realization of his form. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p24.24">Finally, we saw that man's function requires that he work on himself, that he develop the virtue of practical wisdom. </s>

<s n="s9.9;p24.24">We can thus conclude that man's essential nature demands that he develop himself towards his ever-receding end; this process is his function, it is what living well consists in, and it is an ethical process. </s>
