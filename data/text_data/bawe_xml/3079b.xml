<s n="s3.7;p5.20">70 participants will be recruited as Kraemeer &amp; Theinman (1987) stated that group sizes of 30 participants are considered to be the minimum size needed to make valid generalization of study findings to a larger population. </s>

<s n="s2.7;p7.20">There will be no 'control group' receiving neither exercises or splinting as it is not ethical to withhold treatment in a clinical setting (French et al, 2001). </s>
<s n="s3.7;p7.20">All participants will follow an 'exercise programme' designed to put each joint through its full range of movement and improve the strength of the muscles around the hand. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p7.20">The strength exercises will be performed using an elastic band and resistance ball. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p7.20">Passive stretches will be taught to take each joint through its full ROM. The exercise programme will be taught to all the participants by the research therapist. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p7.20">The participants will then be instructed to undertake the exercise programme daily at home. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p7.20">Information sheet which included diagrams and written instructions of the exercises will be given to each participant. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.20">
<s n="s1.4;p8.20">Paddle splints will be individually designed for participants in the exercise and splinting groups. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p8.20">The paddle splint aims to position the wrist in 20-30 degrees of extension avoiding radial and ulna deviation, the MCP and interphalangeal joints in maximum extension and the thumb in abduction and extension (David &amp; Lloyd, 1999). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p8.20">The participants will be given verbal and written instructions stating that the splint should not be worn at night, be removed to carry out the exercise programme and during activities of daily living, but be worn during day-time rest periods. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p8.20">The participant will be asked to return to the splinting department 1 week after having the splints made to ensure that it is fitting correctly. </s>

<s n="s3.5;p9.20">Goniometer measurements will be taken on the lateral aspect of the joint to allow for swelling. </s>

<s n="s3.6;p10.20">The standardised position suggested by The American Society of Hand Therapists (Fess &amp; Morgan, cited in David &amp; Lloyd, 1999) will be used when assessing muscle strength. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p10.20">The assessment will be standardised; the participant will be seated with the shoulder abducted and neutrally rotated, elbow flexed to 90 degrees and the forearm and wrist in neutral. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p10.20">Three measurements will be taken on each side and an average recorded. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p10.20">The Oxford scale of muscle power was chosen not to be used as it involves a high degree of subjectivity on the part of the assessor. </s>
