<s n="s2.2;p2.54">Two notable exceptions to this were the phenomena of <hi rend="italic">blackbody radiation</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">photoelectric effect</hi>, which had yet to be explained in a manner consistent with classical theory. </s>

<p n="p3.54">
<s n="s1.2;p3.54">The term blackbody radiation is used to describe the temperature dependant radiation spectrum emitted by a perfect absorber, an ideal black material that absorbs all and reflects none of the radiant energy falling on it. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p3.54">The laws of thermodynamics and Maxwell's equations had been successfully used to describe several features associated with blackbody radiation, and models explaining the phenomena were found for certain wavelength ranges, although attempts at describing the entire form of the blackbody spectrum using classical theory alone failed. </s>

<s n="s3.7;p48.54">A lower intensity would result in less photons per unit time incident on the cathode, and the net effect would be less photoelectrons and a smaller photocurrent charging the capacitor. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p51.54">This result was found to be inconsistent with recommended values. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p52.54">Possible errors in the measurement of the stopping voltage are also discussed, it is noted that the asymptotic nature of voltage across the capacitor as it reaches the stopping voltage means that it is critical that sufficient time is left for the capacitor to fully charge. </s>

<s n="s1.1;p53.54">Investigations into possible reverse currents at the anode are suggested, since these errors have not been quantified in this technique and their influence on the calculated <hi rend="italic">h</hi> value cannot be accounted for. </s>
