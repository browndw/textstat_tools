<s n="s1.8;p1.11">This situation is centred on exclusion clauses, a notoriously contentious area of contract law. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p1.11">The question raises some interesting issues regarding whether Slowe and Wheezy, and more specifically their driver, can rely on the exclusion clause regarding the breaking of Laura's phone. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p1.11">An initial assessment does not look favourable for their part. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p1.11">Judges have accorded exclusion clauses "the narrowest effect possible"<ref target="BAWE_0315b-ftnote.001"/> and they traditionally approach them on the assumption that it was "inherently improbable"<ref target="BAWE_0315b-ftnote.002"/> that the consumer would have agreed to the exclusion of negligence liability. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p1.11">It will be necessary to examine whether the clause is incorporated into the contract, how rules of interpretation affect it and whether the driver as a third party can rely on the clause. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p1.11">The crux of the problem is to analyse whether the clause can be struck down under UCTA<ref target="BAWE_0315b-ftnote.003"/>, which represents a "statutory endorsement of the post-war policy of consumer protection"<ref target="BAWE_0315b-ftnote.004"/>. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p1.11">A more recent potential statutory recourse is UCCTR<ref target="BAWE_0315b-ftnote.005"/>. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p1.11">Moreover, the problem demonstrates "the willingness of business enterprises to make use of sweeping exemption clauses"<ref target="BAWE_0315b-ftnote.006"/>, sidestepping the consumer's interests. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p2.11">The first stage is to ascertain whether the exclusion clause has been validly incorporated into the contract. </s>

<s n="s5.6;p2.11">"The agreement is looked for objectively"<ref target="BAWE_0315b-ftnote.009"/> and it is irrelevant if the claimant has not read terms and conditions that were brought to their notice, as happened in <hi rend="italic">Parker.</hi> </s>

<s n="s4.10;p6.11">Nevertheless, the courts are historically more favourable to limitation clauses<ref target="BAWE_0315b-ftnote.022"/>, so this clause is likely to be treated adversely by a court. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p6.11">Before the enactment of UCTA, the courts used rules of construction<ref target="BAWE_0315b-ftnote.023"/> to mitigate the effects of exemption clauses. </s>

<s n="s1.9;p9.11">This can be given some flesh by applying the three common law tests from <hi rend="italic">George Mitchell,</hi> namely the risk the defendant has taken in undertaking the transaction, the reward from this risk and the possibility of insurance at a reasonable cost. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p9.11">The weight given to these tests varies from case to case. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p9.11">They are financially motivated and morally neutral, unlike the considerations set out in Schedule 2. </s>

<s n="s2.12;p10.11">She has the requisite standing as this is a non-negotiated contract and she is a consumer, namely someone "acting for purposes which are outside his trade, business or profession"<ref target="BAWE_0315b-ftnote.039"/>. </s>
<s n="s3.12;p10.11">Laura overcomes the hurdle of Regulation 6(2) as she is not challenging a core term of the contract. </s>
<s n="s4.12;p10.11">The Regulations turn upon the concepts of fairness, good faith and "significant imbalance against the consumer"<ref target="BAWE_0315b-ftnote.040"/>. </s>
<s n="s5.12;p10.11">Although "there can be no one single test"<ref target="BAWE_0315b-ftnote.041"/> of fairness, the grey list of terms in Regulation 5(5) "is the most authoritative guide to what fairness entails"<ref target="BAWE_0315b-ftnote.042"/>. </s>
<s n="s6.12;p10.11">The relevant provision to this case is contained in paragraph 1(b), namely "inappropriately excluding or limiting the rights of the consumer"<ref target="BAWE_0315b-ftnote.043"/>. </s>
<s n="s7.12;p10.11">The wideness of this provision shows how "the reach of the Regulations is much broader"<ref target="BAWE_0315b-ftnote.044"/> than UCTA. Additionally, "the determination of fairness will take into account the entire contractual package"<ref target="BAWE_0315b-ftnote.045"/>, which makes Laura's claim more likely to succeed. </s>
<s n="s8.12;p10.11">Under the Regulations, the unfair term is not binding<ref target="BAWE_0315b-ftnote.046"/> but the contract continues "if it is capable of continuing in existence without the unfair term"<ref target="BAWE_0315b-ftnote.047"/>. </s>
<s n="s9.12;p10.11">A key point about the Regulations is that enforcement occurs by complaint to the OFT<ref target="BAWE_0315b-ftnote.048"/>. </s>
<s n="s10.12;p10.11">Often, this is better because "private law enforcement does not provide an effective way of regulating the standard inclusion of unfair terms in adhesion contracts"<ref target="BAWE_0315b-ftnote.049"/>. </s>

<s n="s1.9;p11.11">Laura's cause of action in this case can have three prongs. </s>

<s n="s3.9;p11.11">Therefore, the bus company and its driver cannot rely on it to exclude themselves from negligence liability. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p11.11">As Lord Denning said, it would be "unconscionable"<ref target="BAWE_0315b-ftnote.050"/> for them to exempt themselves from liability in this way. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p11.11">Given that the rules of interpretation provide little assistance, Laura's second line of attack should be under UCTA. She can forcefully argue that the clause is unreasonable, using s 2(2), s 11 and the Schedule 2 criteria. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p11.11">If successful, Laura will be able to sue Slowe and Wheezy for the cost of her mobile phone. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p11.11">However, the court may not buy into this reasoning; as such clauses are relatively common in contracts of carriage. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p11.11">If so, Laura can claim that the clause is unfair under the wider test of the 1999 Regulations. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p11.11">In this instance, the clause only becomes voidable and there is no guarantee of her being able to claim substantial damages. </s>
