<s n="s2.6;p1.10">Accountable to very few Stalin was free to pursue any policy largely unchecked. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p1.10">He had support from the party rank and file as well as from the central committee and the Politburo.<ref target="BAWE_0010b-ftnote.001"/> How Stalin, the least obvious of Lenin's potential successors, came to be in this position is a much contested issue. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p1.10">With his death Lenin left a vacuum within the party leadership creating economic, social and political uncertainty. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p1.10">This in turn led to a left / right divide within the Politburo over the next steps the Bolsheviks should take, with Trotsky on the left arguing for rapid industrialisation.<ref target="BAWE_0010b-ftnote.002"/> Stalin maintained a generally moderate position before siding with Kamenev and Zinoviev forming a powerful triumvate against the man they saw as their biggest rival.<ref target="BAWE_0010b-ftnote.003"/> After Trotsky's eventual expulsion from the party, and then the country, came the political execution of Kamenev and Zinoviev followed by their actual execution. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p1.10">Stalin's other main rivals faded away either in to political destruction, suicide, execution or expulsion. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p2.10">I find it hard to justify putting Stalin's rise to power down to any one single factor. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p2.10">It does not seem possible that Stalin reached his position purely due to his own manipulation or political cunning. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p2.10">Nor does it seem realistic that he was put in power purely because he was the politician that most reflected the party rank and file wishes. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p2.10">A number of reasons seems the most probable explanation; I will argue that the most important are as follows. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p2.10">Stalin proved a useful asset to Lenin and as a result Lenin often supported Stalin's appointments and promotions. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p2.10">The positions Stalin held within the party were of vital importance in helping him gain power, his personality and his political prowess were also very important in this respect. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p2.10">The mistakes of Stalin's rivals during the 1920's were to prove fatal and helped him in his ascendancy to power. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.10">
<s n="s1.6;p3.10">Many of the opportunities which led to Stalin's rise to power were actually accumulated whilst Lenin was still alive.<ref target="BAWE_0010b-ftnote.004"/> Infact on many occasions it was Lenin that endorsed Stalin's promotion to important positions within the party. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p3.10">Stalin fitted the proletariat ideal lacking in so many of the profiles of the Bolshevik leaders including Lenin's own, Stalin was singled out by Lenin as having potential. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p3.10">His activities to raise funds for the party included bank robbing, and he was one of those 'hard core' Bolsheviks who had remained in Russia '...underground during the winter 1905 -6 repression and persecution of revolutionaries by the Tsar." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0010b-ftnote.005"/>
<s n="s4.6;p3.10">This mixture of loyalty and practicality was one Lenin could not resist, he began to rely on Stalin who proved a useful asset.<ref target="BAWE_0010b-ftnote.006"/> 'He was an unquestioningly loyal person who actually got things done... </s>
<s n="s5.6;p3.10">Stalin was Lenin's political fixer...packing the congress with his supporters'.<ref target="BAWE_0010b-ftnote.007"/> Lenin supported and approved many of the positions Stalin was appointed to within the party. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p3.10">Although Trotsky claimed that after Stalin's appointment as party General Secretary Lenin expressed concern; '...this cook will serve only peppery dishes', he did not seem sufficiently concerned to raise public objection until very near his death when it was too late.<ref target="BAWE_0010b-ftnote.008"/> Indeed, prior to his appointment as General Secretary Stalin already held positions of great importance; immediately after the civil war he was Commissar of Nationalities, Commissar of the Workers and Peasants Inspectorate and a member of the Politburo.<ref target="BAWE_0010b-ftnote.009"/> 'Several of Stalin's crucial promotions - cooption to the central committee and appointment as Pravda editor in 1912 and as General Secretary in 1922- were brought about by Lenin's influence.'<ref target="BAWE_0010b-ftnote.010"/> </s>

<s n="s1.8;p4.10">Stalin has been described as 'the spider in the web' in terms of his positioning within both the state and the party apparatus.<ref target="BAWE_0010b-ftnote.011"/> He had influence within all the main offices, and the posts he held gave him direct authority or at the very least powers of persuasion over a very useful range of contacts. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p4.10">At the time of Lenin's death when the struggle for power was fought out amongst the Politburo members, Stalin had power within the Politburo, (the highest decision making body), the Orgburo, (the administrative bureau of the central committee), the Robkrin and the Sovarkom, as well as in the regional and local party cells and the regional and local soviets.<ref target="BAWE_0010b-ftnote.012"/> The very nature of the centralised organisation of the party and the state worked to Stalin's advantage due to the links between all the offices. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p4.10">Though all his positions gave him important influence, it was his position as General Secretary which allowed him to build up the kind of power base which defeated his rivals. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p4.10">In this post Stalin was responsible for Politburo administration including the agenda for discussion, Stalin was the link between the Politburo and the Central Committee, he also controlled the '...appointment and promotion of individuals to key posts throughout the country." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0010b-ftnote.013"/>
<s n="s5.8;p4.10">As Edward Acton points out, this meant that 'the careers of party officials were becoming increasingly dependent upon their loyalty to the Secretariat." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0010b-ftnote.014"/>
<s n="s6.8;p4.10">This in turn gave the '...central administrative organs enormous influence over the make-up of party Congresses and thus of elections to the Central Committee and the Politburo itself'.<ref target="BAWE_0010b-ftnote.015"/> Acton maintains that this 'movement of power from the Politburo to the Secretariat', was initially '...masked under Lenin's authority over the Secretariat." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0010b-ftnote.016"/>
<s n="s7.8;p4.10">However Deutscher claims that on Lenin's return from the recovery of his first stroke he sensed the increasing power of the bureaucracy with Stalin at its head, and immediately attempted (though unsuccessfully) to rectify the situation.<ref target="BAWE_0010b-ftnote.017"/> The position of General Secretary had been largely overlooked as a source of power due to its administrative nature; '...the bright sparks of the Politburo felt themselves above such roles." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0010b-ftnote.018"/>
<s n="s8.8;p4.10">However Stalin was willing to take on this shunted position, and was good at it; he worked hard, he was reliable, made no fuss and needed little assistance from the other Politburo members.<ref target="BAWE_0010b-ftnote.019"/> He converted secondary administrative power in to political power, using the powerful self perpetuating nature of the vested interests within the bureaucracy.<ref target="BAWE_0010b-ftnote.020"/> </s>

<s n="s4.8;p5.10">The moderate position Stalin seemed to take during Politburo meetings both whilst Lenin was alive and after his death allowed him several advantages. </s>

<s n="s6.8;p5.10">Although this may be a rather cynical interpretation of Stalin's political stance during meetings, it did allow him the luxury of supporting which ever people he wished because his views were not an open matter. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p8.10">The final factor in Stalin's rise to power involves the mistakes made by Stalin's opponents during this time. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p8.10">Perhaps one of the most important and most fatal mistakes was the underestimation of Stalin by his rivals; this underestimation in turn led on to other mistakes which were to seal the fates of Stalin's opposition. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p8.10">It was underestimation of Stalin as a worthy and threatening rival which led Kamenev and Zinoviev in to an alliance against Trotsky who they viewed as the most potent danger. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p8.10">'Comrade card index' in his administrative tasks was never identified as a real problem.<ref target="BAWE_0010b-ftnote.032"/> It was Kamenev and Zinoviev that endorsed Stalin's position as General Secretary despite knowledge of Lenin's uncertainty about the suitability of the capricious Georgian for this post.<ref target="BAWE_0010b-ftnote.033"/> Whilst Stalin's fate hung in the balance, Zinoviev and Kamenev argued against the public reading of Lenin's testament, in effect saving Stalin from disgrace and investigation into his conduct as General Secretary.<ref target="BAWE_0010b-ftnote.034"/> Trotsky made several key faults in his battle with Stalin, undermining himself and loosing himself support. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p8.10">He criticised party bureaucracy and the careerists who accompanied it; in effect criticising and threatening the positions of the very people from whom he required support.<ref target="BAWE_0010b-ftnote.035"/> Stalin's other opponents made mistakes which Stalin with his 'peasant shrewdness' could exploit. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p8.10">The united opposition was such an unconvincing union of the former enemies Trotsky, Kamenev and Zinoviev that it was not only bound to fail, but bound to rouse little support from the party.<ref target="BAWE_0010b-ftnote.036"/> These men were all politically broken from previous rounds with Stalin, and could provide little protection to any potential supporters from the increasingly ruthless tactics employed by Stalin and his followers. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p8.10">Likewise, the shaky union made between Zinoviev, Kamenev and Bukharin opposing Stalin's policy of rapid industrialisation and collectivisation, was almost inevitably discovered by Stalin and destroyed through utilisation of the ban on factions rule. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p9.10">To conclude, I have identified four main factors which I have argued played the biggest part in Stalin's rise to power during the 1920's. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p9.10">The acceptance and support Stalin received from Lenin played an important part in allowing Stalin the possibility of playing any kind of key position within the party. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p9.10">The positions Stalin held permitted him great influence within a large number of party areas undetected. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p9.10">He was able to build up a support base and eliminate opposition; turning administrative power into political power.<ref target="BAWE_0010b-ftnote.037"/> Stalin's personal gift at politics gave him an advantage during the uncertainty after Lenin's death. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p9.10">Stalin defeated those he needed to, he was a competent politician and was able to manipulate situations to his advantage in a way his rivals could not. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p9.10">Finally, the mistakes his opposition made, especially their failure to act upon Lenin's wishes to have Stalin removed from his post, and indeed the very uncertainty in which Lenin left the party leadership, allowed Stalin the chances which led to his rise. </s>
