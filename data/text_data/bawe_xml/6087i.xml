Subject to the rights of the these institutions in the BAWE corpus, and pursuant to the ESRC agreement, the BAWE corpus is available to researchers for research purposes PROVIDED THAT the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>1. The corpus files are not distributed in either their original form or in modified form.</p>
<p>2. The texts are used for research purposes only; they should not be reproduced in teaching materials.</p>
<p>3. The texts are not reproduced in full for a wider audience/readership, although researchers are free to quote short passages of text (up to 200 running words from any given text).</p>
<p>4. The BAWE corpus developers (contact: BAWE@warwick.ac.uk) are informed of all projects, dissertations, theses, presentations or publications arising from analysis of the corpus.</p>
<p>5. Researchers acknowledge their use of the corpus using the following form of words: "The data in this study come from the British Academic Written English (BAWE) corpus, which was developed at the Universities of Warwick, Reading and Oxford Brookes under the directorship of Hilary Nesi and Sheena Gardner (formerly of the Centre for Applied Linguistics [previously called CELTE], Warwick), Paul Thompson (Department of Applied Linguistics, Reading) and Paul Wickens (Westminster Institute of Education, Oxford Brookes), with funding from the ESRC (RES-000-23-0800)."</p>

<s n="s5.8;p1.11">This is because it will take just over 10 days for <hi rend="italic">Listeria Monocytogenes</hi> to multiply to the level of concern, (10 <hi rend="sup">3</hi> cfu/g). </s>
<s n="s6.8;p1.11">If the salmon is posted in a simple lined cardboard box the level of contamination will be unacceptable. </s>

<s n="s1.1;p2.11">If these conditions were suitable for posting the fish; prior to dispatch the standards for <hi rend="italic">Listeria Monocytogenes</hi> should be set at a level not greater than 1 cfu/g. </s>
