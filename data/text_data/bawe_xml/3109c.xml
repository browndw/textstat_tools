<s n="s4.4;p1.13">On 1 <hi rend="sup">st</hi> January 2002, 12 EU members got rid of their own currencies and introduced the Euro as their sole currency: the UK is yet to do this. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p3.13">'<hi rend="italic">There's a higher level of mortgage debt and a greater reliance on variable rate mortgages that imply the sensitivity of household interest payments to changes in interest rates is higher in the UK than in any other EU country and considerably higher than in any other large EU economy</hi>'.<ref target="BAWE_3109c-ftnote.002"/> (Miles, D-2004). </s>
<s n="s2.3;p3.13">If the UK becomes part of the Euro the country's interest rates, decided in Frankfurt by the European Central Bank (ECB), will be determined by the euro area as a whole: interest rates will not be sensitive to individual markets, which could lead to a lot of problems in the UK. The Treasury says: "<hi rend="italic">If household's spending is significantly more sensitive to interest rate changes in the UK than in the euro as a whole, a common monetary policy could induce some relative instability in the UK housing market and household's spending'.</hi> </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3109c-ftnote.003"/>
<s n="s3.3;p3.13"> Interest rates for all member countries have been set at a single rate by the ECB: the Euro countries consequently lost the opportunity to use interest rates to moderate house-price inflation. </s>

<s n="s1.11;p4.13">In the EMU's study there are four main structural aspects of the housing market that would lead to differences of interest rate sensitivity and sensitivity of the consumption to housing wealth, in the UK and the euro area households. </s>
<s n="s2.11;p4.13">These are housing tenure, house price trends, mortgage markets and mortgage equity withdrawal. </s>
<s n="s3.11;p4.13">Looking at these four aspects with relation to the UK, housing tenure has considerably higher owner occupation in comparison to some countries in the euro, such as Germany, although lower than smaller countries, such as Spain. </s>
<s n="s4.11;p4.13">House price trends in the UK show real house price growth had been stronger than in other larger euro areas. </s>
<s n="s5.11;p4.13">This is linked to housing supply, which is not considerably high in the UK. As I have previously discussed, the UK suffers from high levels of mortgage debt, combined with the dominance of variable rate mortgages. </s>
<s n="s6.11;p4.13">This implies that the sensitivity of household interest payments to charges in interest rates is higher in the UK than the euro area countries. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p4.13">Finally, the competitive, liberalisation of the UK mortgage market makes it easier for households to access their housing wealth than it is for other euro countries, which is shown through the amount of mortgage equity withdrawal. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p4.13">This is confirmed by the view of the HM treasury '<hi rend="italic">The UK has seen a rapid rise in personal borrowing, which reflects the relative ease of achieving mortgage equity withdrawal in less regulated markets and trends in housing equity itself</hi>." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3109c-ftnote.004"/>
<s n="s9.11;p4.13">People in the UK re-mortgage their properties so they can use the cash for personal use, such as spending and consumption. </s>
<s n="s10.11;p4.13">Therefore, the flexibility of the variable rate mortgage is much more appealing. </s>
<s n="s11.11;p4.13">There are also fewer restrictions on credit in the UK, which means lenders offer high loan to value ratios, which means households with smaller incomes can have larger, more expensive houses. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p5.13">Since 1960s a lower than average national income, with reference to that of the EU, has been invested in the UK housing market, the result of this being an increase in house prices. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p5.13">Over the long term, they have risen, on average, two and a half percent a year. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p5.13">Owner occupation is 70%, which is similar to the EU average. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p5.13">With so much owner-occupation there is a high level of mortgage debt in the UK, considerably higher than within the rest of the EU: it's 60% of the gross domestic product (GDP) in the UK. One of the reasons for this is offered by the EMU study on <hi rend="italic">Housing, Consumption and the EMU,</hi> is that '<hi rend="italic">that there are mortgages held by householders who are private landlords'</hi>. <ref target="BAWE_3109c-ftnote.005"/> </s>

Interest rates affect household incomes differently depending on the amount fixed or variable rate mortgages that are held. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p6.13">Variable rate mortgages are prevalent in the UK, with over 60% of UK mortgages being of the variable kind, which move closely in line with base rates, and only 7% are at long-term fixed rates. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p6.13">Thus, causing major problems for the UK, if it joins the EU, as the ECB can change interest rates every two weeks, which would make things extremely volatile. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p6.13">In comparison to other countries in the EU, where fixed rate mortgages are more prevalent, a constant change in interest rates would not be so disruptive. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p6.13">Joining a currency union with no monetary flexibility requires the UK to have more flexibility in labour markets and in the housing market. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p6.13">The UK rented sector is too small to be a flexible substitute for owner-occupation. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p6.13">The UK has instituted within the Bank of England a very effective apparatus for managing interest rates. </s>

<s n="s2.4;p8.13">This is the question that is of most significance when looking at the UK housing market and the euro. </s>
