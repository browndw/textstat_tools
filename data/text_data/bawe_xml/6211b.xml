<quote lang="English" rend="italic">'The historic categories of aristocracy point either in the direction of intelligence...or in the direction of ... religious organization; but neither the philosopher-king of the classical period or the prophet-priest type is seen in the aristocracy of the modern day'. </quote>
<p n="p27.29">
<s n="s1.1;p27.29">What is more, the only one of those attributes found in Plato's Republic is the elite of intelligence; the Rulers do not have wealth or property and have to rule on behalf of the ruled; doing so because they are forced to; not because they have political ambitions. </s>

<p n="p28.29">
<s n="s1.2;p28.29">In conclusion, Plato's Republic does contain a model state that can be seen to be based on elitist principles; but we must remember that our political mindsets are different to those of the classical period. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p28.29">Moreover, to condemn Plato for his elitist ideals would be to condemn our present day society for retaining them to a certain extent, after centuries of 'progress'. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p29.29">If we were to condemn Plato for his viewpoints, it would be seen as an attack on our own belief that everyone is entitled to their own opinion. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p29.29">Naturally we may supply the counter arguments to any viewpoint but we should never go beyond this; unless we wish to repeat the travesties that were the crusades and the witch hunts. </s>
