<s n="s4.7;p1.17">Unfortunately this is not compatible with traditional microbiological techniques which can take a number of days (and in some cases up to a week). </s>
<s n="s5.7;p1.17">Other factors such as the demand for longer shelf lives and the strong market competition are also incompatible with traditional microbiological techniques. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p1.17">The demand for longer shelf lives has meant that producer with short shelf life products want to get their products on the supermarket shelf immediately after production rather than holding them till microbiological analysis has been completed. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p1.17">This is also a factor, when increasing the profitability of a company, if you can get your product out to the supermarket immediately after production, your company does not have to maintain it at a refrigerated hold which may be expensive. </s>

<s n="s3.6;p2.17">The most traditional method is to prepare a dilution of the sample and then to plate this on to a medium such as violet red bile agar (VRBA). </s>
<s n="s4.6;p2.17">This can then be incubated for a period of 24hours at 35°C. After this period it is possible to give a count of the total number of coliforms present in the food sample. </s>

<head rend="bold">Discussion:</head>
<p n="p9.17">
<s n="s1.3;p9.17">Looking at the results it can be seen that both methods gave a fairly similar count as to the number of <hi rend="italic">E.coli</hi> organisms present in the sample tested. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p9.17">The method using the membranes and indole test solution indicated that there were 2.7×10 <hi rend="sup">3</hi> <hi rend="italic">E.coli</hi> organisms per gram of the sample and the 'Petrifilm' method indicated that there were 2.0×10 <hi rend="sup">3</hi> <hi rend="italic">E.coli</hi> organisms per gram of the food sample tested. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p9.17">Therefore, as a result of both ,methods it can be stated that there was approximately 2.4×10 <hi rend="sup">3</hi> <hi rend="italic">E.coli</hi> organisms per gram of brie (the food sample which was tested). </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.17">
<s n="s1.2;p10.17">That both methods give similar result and the repeats of each individual method were similar give confidence in the results obtained. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p10.17">This means that it can be stated that <hi rend="italic">E.coli</hi> was present in the food sample that was examined although at this stage it cannot be determined which strain of <hi rend="italic">E.coli</hi> was isolated and whether there was more than one strain present (there is likely to be a few). </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.17">
<s n="s1.6;p11.17">Cheese is made be fermenting milk (which in some cases may be un-pasteurised). </s>
<s n="s2.6;p11.17">It is therefore notoriously high in the levels of bacteria that it contains. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p11.17">A total viable count of the bacteria present in a sample of cheese that is considered to be of high microbiological quality will probably give a result of over 10 <hi rend="sup">6</hi> micro-organisms per gram. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p11.17">The majority of these will be completely harmless although some such as <hi rend="italic">Listeria, Salmonella</hi> and <hi rend="italic"> E.coli</hi> (HO157) may be pathogenic. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p11.17">It would therefore be expected to find <hi rend="italic">E.coli</hi> and other bacteria in a sample of cheese so the levels detected are not surprising. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p11.17">Further testing of the <hi rend="italic">E.coli</hi> species would be required to ensure it was not a pathogenic species such as HO157. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.17">
<s n="s1.3;p12.17">This investigation could be taken further by trying to type the <hi rend="italic">E.coli</hi> isolated. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p12.17">This could done by doing further biochemical tests or using a method such as the API method (a series of biochemical tests in one unit). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p12.17">Other methods of <hi rend="italic">E.coli</hi> enumeration could also be looked at to see whether these too gave similar results. </s>
