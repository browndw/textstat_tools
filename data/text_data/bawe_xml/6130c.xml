<head rend="bold">INTRODUCTION</head>
<p n="p1.34">
<s n="s1.2;p1.34">The first human colonisation of Cyprus has been a much debated topic in recent archaeological discourse particularly since the excavations at Akrotiri <hi rend="italic">Aetokremnos</hi> provided dates of human activity several millennia earlier than previous research had shown (Simmons 1991: 863). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p1.34">Further discoveries of Early Pre-Pottery Neolithic sites such as Parekklisha <hi rend="italic">Shillourokambos</hi> and Kissonerga <hi rend="italic">Mylouthkia</hi> provide evidence for 'colonisation' rather than just 'visitation' which, when studied in the wider context of the island and the surrounding mainland, aid in understanding the process of colonisation not only in Cyprus but also for the Mediterranean islands in general. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.34">
<s n="s1.4;p2.34">The following discussion is divided into three sections preceded by a semantic explanation of terms used to describe the stages of colonisation. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p2.34">Part 1 presents the archaeological evidence from Cyprus with reference to key sites, the locations of which are shown in figure 1. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p2.34">The question of the origins of these first settlers is addressed in the second section through the observation of similarities in material culture and technology from sites in the Levant and Anatolia. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p2.34">The third part explores the process of colonisation in the context of Cyprus but also within the general theoretical framework of island colonisation. </s>
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">VISITATION, OCCUPATION OR COLONISATION? </head>
<p n="p3.34">
<s n="s1.3;p3.34">Before embarking on a discussion about the evidence for the colonisation of Cyprus, it is important to define exactly what is meant by 'colonisation' and to distinguish it from other terms such as 'visitation' or 'occupation'. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p3.34">Although all three terms can be used to describe human presence on the island, each one encompasses different types of human activity and permanence of settlement as reflected in the material remains. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p3.34">Cherry defines occupation to be when "an island has become for one or more groups the principal provider of its subsistence requirements and the focus of its residential pattern throughout the year" (1981:48) in comparison to 'utilisation' which is associated with seasonal or short-term visits for the purpose of exploiting the natural resources, and for accidental or unsuccessful colonisation (1990:198). </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.34">
<s n="s1.7;p4.34">It is proposed here that there are three stages for discussion in the colonisation of the Mediterranean islands: 'visitation'; 'occupation'; and 'colonisation', not all of which will necessarily be represented on every island. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p4.34">Outlined here are the definitions as used in this study. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p4.34">'Visitation,' which is based on Cherry's classification of 'utilisation' (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>.), refers to short and seasonal visits primarily (though not necessarily solely) for the exploitation of island resources. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p4.34">The term 'visitation,' with its connotations of brevity and impermanence, is preferred to 'utilisation' since the exploitation of resources may have been equally important during periods of occupation and colonisation. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p4.34">'Accidental' and 'unsuccessful' colonisation are excluded from this category since a certain amount of inference is required to surmise whether colonisation was intentional or accidental or whether acquisition of resources was the only objective when visiting an island. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p4.34">It has been cited that the export of domesticates to islands can be taken as evidence of deliberate colonisation (Cherry 1990:198) but this excludes explorations prior to domestication and those groups reliant on a hunter-gatherer subsistence strategy. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p4.34">This theory also precludes alternative methods of the transportation of domesticates such as trade and exchange networks. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.34">
<s n="s1.3;p5.34">'Occupation' as defined by Cherry can be split into two categories, 'occupation' and 'colonisation', both of which suggest a certain level of permanence of settlement and year-round habitation with the island supplying all subsistence resources. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p5.34">Where they differ is in long-term continuity of settlement. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p5.34">'Colonisation' is the final stage where humans finally inhabit and populate an island without withdrawal due to insufficient resources or unviable population while 'occupation' is the preceding phase in this process, perhaps lasting only a few generations but is then unsuccessful or abandoned resulting in a discontinuity of settlement. </s>

<s n="s3.5;p6.34">(Simmons 1991:865). </s>
<s n="s4.5;p6.34">The site has been interpreted as a specialised food processing site (Simmons 1999:310) and is characterised by an enormous faunal assemblage containing over 200,000 bones dominated by the remains of extinct Pleistocene species <hi rend="italic">Phanourios minutus</hi>, as well as containing a deer, pigs, a variety of birds and marine invertebrates (Simmons 2001:5). </s>
<s n="s5.5;p6.34">Cultural features supporting an anthropogenic origin for this deposit include hearths, burnt bone, chipped stone tools and various other artefacts including 2 picrolite pendants/ beads and a pierced stone disc. </s>

<s n="s2.5;pn1.1">Site names are made up of the name of the nearest village followed by the nearest topographic feature but are usually referred to only by the second word and the village name is dropped. </s>
<s n="s3.5;pn1.1">There are some exceptions to this rule, such as Khirokitia- <hi rend="italic">Vounoi</hi>, which is known only as Khirokitia. </s>
<s n="s4.5;pn1.1">Refering to a site by the second part of the name prevents confusion in cases where villages have more than one site in their environs (e.g. </s>

</p>
</note>
<p n="p7.34">
<s n="s1.8;p7.34">There is some debate as to whether this site represents colonisation of the island or if it is just a visitation site. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p7.34">Archaeologists have been criticised for their "tendency not only to emphasise the first evidence of human presence in the islands, but also to assume that such finds are indicative of <hi rend="italic">successful</hi> colonisation" (Cherry 1990: 198, author's emphasis). </s>
<s n="s3.8;p7.34">The excavator concludes that is it 'unclear' whether the <hi rend="italic">Aetokremnos</hi> people were visitors or were actual colonisers (Simmons 2001:14). </s>
<s n="s4.8;p7.34">The people using the site are clearly exploiting the local resources, particularly the endemic fauna, however, since it is estimated that <hi rend="italic">Aetokremnos</hi> was in use for several hundred years (Simmons 1999:322), it lacks the brevity associated with 'visitation' and does not appear to be based on seasonal utilisation (Simmons 1999:322). </s>
<s n="s5.8;p7.34">In the absence of any substantial continuity demonstrable between this and later sites, the Akrotiri phase should be defined as an 'occupation' phase rather than colonisation. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p7.34">Given that current evidence indicates that the island was abandoned when native faunal resources declined, it could be argued that this represents visitation. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p7.34">As more discoveries are made which fill in the gap between the Akrotiri phase and the Aceramic Neolithic, it may be that what has thus far been assumed to be visitation or unsuccessful colonisation may require re-evaluation. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p7.34">"The absence of evidence...is not evidence of absence" (Watkins 2004: 24) and perhaps future research may reveal that <hi rend="italic">Aetokremnos</hi> does in fact represent the initial stages of colonisation. </s>

</head>
<p n="p8.34">
<s n="s1.3;p8.34">Prior to the excavation of <hi rend="italic">Aetokremnos</hi>, there was no evidence for human occupation before the Aceramic Neolithic in the 6 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> Millennium B.C. Khirokitia and contemporary sites were the earliest known on the island. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p8.34">Comparisons were made between the archaeological remains from contemporary mainland sites and those from Khirokitia in order to establish the origin of the 'first' Cypriots through similarities and to ascertain whether they were direct descendents or if differences in material culture implied that they had island predecessors who were as yet undiscovered. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p8.34">Stanley Price expressed this in the form of two opposing hypotheses: the 'colonisation hypothesis and the 'antecedent development hypothesis', describing the latter as "not only logically but empirically inadequate" (1977b: 66) but which has since been proved correct through discoveries of earlier material. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.34">
<s n="s1.8;p9.34">Though it is possible that the Akrotiri people may have been the distant ancestors of later colonisers through the impartation of some kind of 'residual memory' of the island passed down through the generations (Simmons 1999:323), the Aceramic Neolithic phase is so far removed (both chronologically and culturally) that it is difficult to compare the two. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p9.34">Aetokremnos is not a settlement but a processing site, it has no burials, no architecture and is reliant on a hunter-gatherer subsistence strategy, whereas Khirokitia is a large village with stone built structures, intra-mural burials and an economy based on agro-pastoralism. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p9.34">Evidence for the antecedents of the Aceramic Neolithic population was discovered at Parekklisha-<hi rend="italic">Shillourokambos</hi> and Kissonerga- <hi rend="italic">Mylouthkia</hi>. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p9.34">These are multi-phase sites with the earliest phases having radiocarbon dates in the late 10 <hi rend="sup">th</hi>/ 9 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> millennium B.P (Peltenburg <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p9.34">2000: 846). </s>
<s n="s6.8;p9.34">These sites, along with Akanthou and Ais- <hi rend="italic">Yorkis</hi> belong to a stage in Cypriot prehistory which has been termed the 'Cypro-PPNB' (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi> </s>
<s n="s7.8;p9.34">) expressing its contemporaneity with the Levantine PPNB, or Pre-Pottery Neolithic 'B' and also its distinctively individual nature. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p9.34">This period can also be described as the Early Aceramic Neolithic, the advantage of which is that it does not create boundaries and allows for continuity into the next phase, however for ease of reference to specific groups of sites in this discussion 'Cypro-PPNB' will be used. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.34">
<s n="s1.7;p10.34">
<hi rend="italic">Mylouthkia</hi> is characterised by subterranean features such as pits, a semi-subterranean structure and 5 wells which are among the earliest known examples in the world (Peltenburg <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s2.7;p10.34">2000: 844). </s>
<s n="s3.7;p10.34">The deposits in the wells included: human and faunal remains which were arranged in such a way as to suggest particular burial practices; chipped stone tools such as Byblos points and glossed blades reminiscent of mainland assemblages; domesticated cereal grains and chaff (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>.:848-849); and a number of groundstone artefacts including a unique polished pink macehead (Peltenburg in Peltenburg <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p10.34">2003: 92). </s>
<s n="s5.7;p10.34">Obsidian, which is not a natural resource available in Cyprus, also appeared in the wells. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p10.34">Croft noted that a "conspicuous concentration of this normally rare material" was retrieved from well 116 and estimated that much more was probably overlooked during excavation (Croft in Peltenburg <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>. </s>

<s n="s3.9;p11.34">Post holes indicate the presence of wooden structures, some in the form of round buildings and another which is thought to be an animal enclosure (Guilaine &amp; Briois 2001: 41-42), an explanation which is supported by the presence of domesticates in the faunal assemblage. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p11.34">Fragments of plaster in association with large stones have been interpreted as the remains stone buildings (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>.:47). </s>
<s n="s5.9;p11.34">The lithic assemblage is comprised of flakes, blades and projectile points, including Byblos and Amuq points comparable to those on the mainland (Peltenburg <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p11.34">2000: 848). </s>
<s n="s7.9;p11.34">The use of sickles is indicated by an antler haft (Guilaine &amp; Briois 2001: 47) and obsidian bladelets are also present (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>.). </s>
<s n="s8.9;p11.34">Anthropomorphic and zoomorphic imagery are portrayed in sculptural form by a small lime plaster figurine and a carved serpentine head which appears to be feline both of which were discovered in well contexts. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p11.34">These, in addition to a number of incised pebbles, have been taken as evidence for some kind of symbolic or ritualised behaviour (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>.). </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.34">
<s n="s1.7;p12.34">The discovery of Cypro-PPNB sites goes some way towards filling the gap between the Akrotiri phase and the Aceramic Neolithic. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p12.34">They also provide evidence for the earliest colonisation (as opposed to visitation) of Cyprus. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p12.34">Given that <hi rend="italic">Shillourokambos</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Mylouthkia</hi> are reoccupied in later phases and that occupation is contemporary with Kalavasos <hi rend="italic">Tenta</hi> which provides settlement continuity into the Aceramic Neolithic, these sites provide evidence of long-term habitation on the island. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p12.34">The investment of time and labour in modification of the landscape as demonstrated by stone architecture at <hi rend="italic">Shillourokambos</hi> and the digging of wells, which at <hi rend="italic">Mylouthkia</hi> were up to 8 metres deep (Peltenburg <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s5.7;p12.34">2001: 846), illustrates an attachment to place and implies permanent year-round occupation of the sites, a suggestion which is further supported by burial evidence. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p12.34">While remains of domesticated plant and animal species provide evidence that all the subsistence needs of the population were met by resources available on the island (although initially imported) and did not require them to travel to other sources. </s>

<head rend="bold">TRANSMISSION AND TRANSFORMATION</head>
<p n="p13.34">
<s n="s1.13;p13.34">Throughout this discussion, 'the mainland' has been mentioned. </s>
<s n="s2.13;p13.34">This refers to the area from Anatolia to the north of the island, stretching down the Levantine corridor to southern Jordan and Israel. </s>
<s n="s3.13;p13.34">It is from somewhere in this vast region that the first colonisers came from. </s>
<s n="s4.13;p13.34">There are a number of lines of enquiry which can be considered in order to establish the potential origins of the people who first colonised Cyprus. </s>
<s n="s5.13;p13.34">These include the identification of the provenance of imported raw materials such as obsidian and the observation of similarities in technology, burial practice and imagery as interpreted through material culture remains. </s>
<s n="s6.13;p13.34">However, this can be a complex process since the observation of similarities from one region to another cannot be assumed <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> to be proof of origin or even contact, but may reflect simultaneous innovation, nor can differences between two samples eliminate the possibility of association. </s>
<s n="s7.13;p13.34">This is because material culture is often transformed as it moves through time and space as a result of different uses in the new context, or expressions of identity of different social groups. </s>
<s n="s8.13;p13.34">It has been demonstrated that "human agency can result in radical cultural change in short spans of time" (Robb 2001:196) but "not all aspects of culture are transmitted or transformed in the same way, nor to the same degree" (Clarke, forthcoming). </s>
<s n="s9.13;p13.34">Therefore, the question of origins should be approached with caution. </s>
<s n="s10.13;p13.34">The roots of the first Cypriots 'remain elusive' even to those whose research has been focused in this area for many years (Peltenburg <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>. </s>
<s n="s11.13;p13.34">2000: 851). </s>
<s n="s12.13;p13.34">Current research favours Northern Syria (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>.; Cauvin 2000: 218) but cultural similarities throughout the region make it difficult to identify the precise origin. </s>
<s n="s13.13;p13.34">Consequently, the following discussion does not attempt to reach a conclusive outcome but seeks to present the evidence for possible sources of the founding population. </s>

<head rend="bold">LITHIC TECHNOLOGY</head>
<p n="p14.34">
<s n="s1.8;p14.34">Over one thousand chipped stone artefacts were recovered from Aetokremnos, all of which were produced from local raw materials (Simmons 2004: 3-4), which demonstrates that they were manufactured on the island and not imported, a fact substantiated by the presence of cores and debitage. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p14.34">A comparative study of the chipped stone assemblage from Aetokremnos, other Cypriot sites and the mainland has been undertaken (Simmons 1999: chapter 11) where it was concluded that no analogues could be demonstrated (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>.: 281) This study was prior to the publication of excavations at <hi rend="italic">Mylouthkia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Shillourokambos</hi>. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p14.34">The Cypriot sites included in this study were Aceramic Neolithic and, as such, were chronologically separated from the Aetokremnos assemblage by several millennia. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p14.34">In view of this fact, it would seem logical to expect a different tool technology while a consistency in lithics despite population discontinuity would appear anomalous! </s>
<s n="s5.8;p14.34">Nevertheless, the Aetokremnos assemblage remains unique in Cyprus despite the Cypro-PPNB discoveries. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p14.34">Simmons' assessment concludes that the specialised nature of the site is responsible for the individual nature of the chipped stone tools, given that pigmy hippopotami or other similar species were not present on the mainland, the requisite tools needed to process the carcasses would not have been manufactured either (1999: 281). </s>
<s n="s7.8;p14.34">Elsewhere it has been stated that the assemblage would not be out of place in Epipalaeolithic or early Neolithic mainland assemblages (Simmons 2004: 3). </s>
<s n="s8.8;p14.34">The distinctive thumbnail scrapers which dominate the assemblage at Aetokremnos, are also found in smaller proportions at Anatolian and Levantine sites of comparable dates (Simmons 1999:319) but the microlithic tools and projectile points which characterise the Natufian and the Early Neolithic respectively, are conspicuous in their absence from this first occupation of Cyprus. </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.34">
<s n="s1.6;p15.34">The Cypro-PPNB assemblages have been described as "a socially determined mixture of conservatism and change" (McCartney 2004: 118), showing some mainland traits but also developing a character of its own. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p15.34">The lithic assemblages from <hi rend="italic">Mylouthkia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Shillourokambos</hi> share a number of characteristics with the mainland: use of high quality raw materials; naviform core technology; and the production of similar tool types (McCartney in Peltenburg <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>. </s>
