<p n="p1.59">
<s n="s1.5;p1.59">Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disease that causes a number of symptoms throughout the entire body. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p1.59">The most common symptom is breathing difficulties, caused by the body's susceptibility to common lung infections. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p1.59">Over the course of time successive lung infections cause significant lung damage, leaving the lungs struggling to function and making breathing difficult [1]. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p1.59">Cystic fibrosis sufferers are particularly susceptible to pneumonia. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p1.59">There is no cure for cystic fibrosis, although the effects of lung infections can be reduced by a course of antibiotics early in the course of the infection. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.59">
<s n="s1.4;p2.59">The pancreas is similarly affected by cystic fibrosis, failing to produce digestive enzymes which makes it difficult for cystic fibrosis patients to absorb nutrients [1]. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p2.59">This means that cystic fibrosis sufferers often suffer from malnutrition, resulting in them growing in height at a lower rate than normal and consequently they have often have lower heights than would be predicted. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p2.59">The difficulty absorbing nutrients also leads to generally low weights when compared with the rest of the population [2]. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p2.59">Cystic fibrosis also causes liver problems and infertility, but this report will mostly be concerned with examining the malnutrition and lung damage of patients suffering from cystic fibrosis. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.59">
<s n="s1.1;p3.59">This report ultimately aims to explore the relationship between the strength of the respiratory muscles in cystic fibrosis patients and their level of malnutrition and lung damage, producing a good model for a patient's maximal static expiratory pressure (a measure of the strength of the respiratory muscles) with respect to their lung volume and other variables. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.59">
<s n="s1.1;p4.59">The cystic fibrosis data is a collection of measurements of age, sex, height, weight, Body Mass Index (BMI), body mass as a percentage of the age-specific median in normal individuals (BMP), forced expiratory volume (1 second) as a percentage of forced vital capacity (FEV1), residual volume (RV), functional residual capacity (FRC), total lung capacity (TLC) and maximal static expiratory pressure (PEmax) from 25 individuals with cystic fibrosis aged between 7 and 23. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.59">
<s n="s1.7;p5.59">The data set is a multivariate data set, with the variables height, weight, BMI and BMP all indicative in some manner of the general level of a patient's malnutrition and the variables FEV1, RV, FRC and TLC all measuring various aspects of a patient's lung volume. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p5.59">RV, residual volume, represents the amount of air remaining in the lungs following a maximal expiration of air from the lungs (all the air that remains after you have fully breathed out). </s>
<s n="s3.7;p5.59">FRC, functional residual capacity, is the amount of air remaining in the lungs following a normal breath. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p5.59">TLC, total lung capacity, is the total volume of the lungs following a maximal respiration. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p5.59">These are complicated to measure and involve the patient being placed in an air-tight chamber, or nitrogen washout of the lungs. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p5.59">They also require the cooperation of the patient to get a reliable measurement and are often under measured. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p5.59">FEV1, the forced expiratory volume as a percentage of Forced Vital Capacity, can be taken using a spirometer and is slightly less dependent on patient cooperation than the other measurements. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.59">
<s n="s1.5;p6.59">The most promising general form of model to fit to the data seems to be a multiple linear regression model using PEmax as the dependent variable. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p6.59">However, given the number of variables involved in the data set, careful analysis will be required to determine the variables chosen to use in the regression. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p6.59">An important aspect of the initial analysis will be data reduction and summary to examine relationships between the variables. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p6.59">Due to the number of variables measuring the same underlying features (and therefore expecting to have high correlations with each other) multicollinearity will likely be a consideration in the regression. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p6.59">The data will also need to be analysed to determine if any anomalous results or outliers are present. </s>

<head rend="underlined bold">Summary of the Data</head>
<p n="p7.59">
<s n="s1.1;p7.59">The table below describes each of the variables individually with several summary statistics suggesting the location and spread of each variable. </s>

<head rend="underlined bold">Table 1 - Summary Statistics</head>
<row>
<cell/>
</row>
</table>
<p n="p8.59">
<s n="s1.5;p8.59">Additionally, 44% of the group was male and 56% female, suggesting that there is a fairly even male-female spread in the population. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p8.59">The table gives a fairly good indication of the location, range and general spread of the data. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p8.59">Weight, age and RV in particular seem to have a large amount of variation. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p8.59">In particular, none of the subjects have a BMP over 100 so all of the subjects are below the average body mass index for their age. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p8.59">This is a fairly good indication that most of them are suffering from malnutrition. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.59">
<s n="s1.1;p9.59">There do not seem to be any cases of extreme outliers within the variables - all the minimum and maximum values are within three standard deviations of the mean, and the table below demonstrates that all the points fall within the inner fences (at 1.5 times the interquartile range) of the data. </s>
</p>
<table id="BAWE_0406e-tab.002">
<head rend="underlined bold">Table 2 - Quartiles </head>
<row>
<cell/>
</row>
</table>
<p n="p10.59">
<s n="s1.2;p10.59">This is not definitive evidence that there are no outliers present in the data, but there are no clear extreme values that appear to be caused by anything other than normal variation in the data. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p10.59">The values of subjects 15 and 25 for PEmax come close to being considered mild outliers and warrant further consideration, but there are no values which need to be eliminated immediately or investigated because they appear to be caused by experimental error. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.59">
<s n="s1.4;p11.59">The table of quartiles also gives some indication of the spread of the data within variables that the simple summary statistics did not highlight. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p11.59">Many of the variables appear to be quite heavily positively skewed. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p11.59">BMP, RV and PEmax all have median values that are far closer to the value of the lower quartile than the upper quartile, indicating skewness of the data. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p11.59">This is further emphasised by examining the distribution of PEmax. </s>
</p>
<figure id="BAWE_0406e-fig.001">
<head rend="underlined bold">Graph 1 - Histogram of PEmax</head>
</figure>
<p n="p12.59">
<s n="s1.4;p12.59">The above histogram gives an indication of the distribution of PEmax. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p12.59">It appears as though PEmax is roughly normally distributed but highly positively skewed, with a heavy right tail. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p12.59">The extreme values could be considered outliers but the number of them suggests they are not. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p12.59">With a relatively small sample size it is difficult to determine whether a variable is actually normally distributed but the histogram seems to indicate that PEmax has some significant deviations from the normal and a normal probability plot of PEmax backs this up. </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.59">
<s n="s1.3;p13.59">An idea of the relationships between the different variables and how strongly they relate to each other can be gained from looking at the correlation between the different variables. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p13.59">The table below shows the correlations between all the variables. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p13.59">Particularly strong or notable correlations have been highlighted in bold. </s>

<head rend="underlined bold">Table 3 - Correlation Matrix of Variables</head>
<row>
<cell/>
</row>
</table>
<p n="p14.59">
<s n="s1.7;p14.59">Particularly notable is the strong correlation between age, height, weight and body mass index. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p14.59">As these have been measured to get an idea of the underlying level of malnutrition in the patients it is unsurprising that the correlation between these variables is strong. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p14.59">Age has little correlation with BMP since BMP takes into account the average body mass index of a patient's age, thus removing age as a factor in BMI. Sex has very little correlation with any of the other variables, indicating that there may be no real difference between the male and female patients examined. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p14.59">The correlations of the lung volume variables are surprising. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p14.59">While you would expect larger lung volumes to translate into better lung strength, three of the lung volume variables seem to have a weak negative relationship with a patient's maximal static expiratory pressure. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p14.59">Additionally, FEV1 seems to have produced significantly different results to the other three measures of lung volume, showing weak negative correlation with the other variables. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p14.59">This is likely to be due to the difference between how FEV1 and RV/FRC/TLC are measured. </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.59">
<s n="s1.2;p15.59">The strongest relationship of any variable with PEmax is with age. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p15.59">The graph below shows a plot of age against PEmax. </s>
</p>
<figure id="BAWE_0406e-fig.002">
<head rend="underlined bold">Graph 2 - Age vs. PEmax</head>
</figure>
<p n="p16.59">
<s n="s1.3;p16.59">The relationship between age and PEmax appears to be quite strong and reasonably linear. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p16.59">Older subjects clearly have higher values of PEmax in general, although there are two outliers that suggest that the relationship might not be perfectly linear. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p16.59">Height and weight have similar relationships with PEmax. </s>
</p>
<p n="p17.59">
<s n="s1.3;p17.59">The graph below gives some indication of the relationship between the lung volumes of the subjects and their maximal static expiratory pressure (PEmax). </s>
<s n="s2.3;p17.59">The graph has ordered the subjects in ascending order based on their PEmax value, with 1 representing the subject with the lowest value of PEmax and 25 the subject with the highest value of PEmax. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p17.59">The circle shows the residual lung volume (RV) of the patient, the triangle their functional residual lung volume (FRC) and the cross their total lung volume (TLC). </s>

<figure id="BAWE_0406e-fig.003">
<head rend="underlined bold">Graph 3 - Plot of Subjects' Lung Volumes</head>
</figure>
<p n="p18.59">
<s n="s1.4;p18.59">The graph demonstrates some interesting features of the relationship between the various lung volume variables. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p18.59">Firstly, for all patients, RV is the highest of all volumes and in most cases the difference between RV and the other two variables is dramatic. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p18.59">On the whole, FRC is also greater than TLC, although there are a few cases where TLC is above FRC (note than in these cases the difference between the two is extremely small). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p18.59">In general, this is enough to conclude that RV is greater than FRC and FRC is greater than TLC. Subjects with low RV values also seem to have much smaller differences between the three measurements, whereas those with high RV values have quite pronounced variation between the variables. </s>
</p>
<p n="p19.59">
<s n="s1.5;p19.59">The ordering of the subjects based on the value of their PEmax also gives a rough indication of the relationship between lung volume and PEmax. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p19.59">However, the relationship is not particularly clear (or strong). </s>
<s n="s3.5;p19.59">TLC seems to remain pretty much constant across the graph, indicating that there is little connection between those subjects with high TLC and those with high PEmax. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p19.59">The same applies for FRC, although there is much more variation in this case. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p19.59">RV seems like it might have a weak linear relationship with PEmax but the data does not demonstrate a strong enough relationship to make a solid conclusion on this point. </s>
</p>

<div1 type="section">
<head rend="underlined bold">Data Analysis</head>
<p n="p20.59">
<s n="s1.7;p20.59">The cystic fibrosis data appears to be representative, although there is little additional information about how the data was collected or sampled. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p20.59">The analysis looks to model the maximal static expiratory pressure of people suffering from cystic fibrosis, therefore the data should be representative of the population of cystic fibrosis patients. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p20.59">The data is representative of the population of cystic fibrosis patients to some degree, although the age range is the cause of some concern. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p20.59">Cystic fibrosis is usually diagnosed at an early age (over half are diagnosed as a baby and many are diagnosed at birth [3]) and patients typically live to the age of 30 [4], so it seems unusual that the data only spans between the ages of 7 and 23. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p20.59">Since the ages are fairly evenly distributed in that range it seems as though only examining this range was done by intent. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p20.59">There also seems to be a good distribution of males and females within the age range, although all the older results are female and there are no results for a male over the age of 19. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p20.59">Overall the data seems representative of the population of cystic fibrosis patients in the early to mid stages of their illness (ie. between the ages of around 7 to 23). </s>
</p>
<p n="p21.59">
<s n="s1.3;p21.59">The lack of results out of this age range means that the conclusions from the analysis cannot necessarily be extended to the whole population of cystic fibrosis patients - while the other variables may lie within the ranges collected other trends may be present outside the age range. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p21.59">For instance, an extremely young patient is likely to be considered relatively malnourished but since they are in the early stages of cystic fibrosis and thus unlikely to have suffered from many infections which are the main cause of lung damage in cystic fibrosis patients. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p21.59">Additionally, in this age group there is likely to be a strong relationship between age and height/weight due to natural growth that may not necessarily hold for older patients. </s>
</p>
<p n="p22.59">
<s n="s1.3;p22.59">In terms of reliability, there is not much to go in determining whether the data is reliable or not. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p22.59">There is not much information about how the data has been collected (for instance, whether RV, FRC and TLC were all collected via the same method, as these variables can be measured in different ways). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p22.59">Without this or a larger number of results (a sample size of 25 when dealing with 11 variables is not particularly large, and could pose problems when trying to form an appropriate model) or repeated measurements of some of the variables (this would be particularly useful with the lung volume measurements, which rely on patient cooperation and can change quite a bit from measurement to measurement) it is impossible to conclusively state that the data is reliable. </s>
</p>
<p n="p23.59">
<s n="s1.9;p23.59">A few obvious points can be covered, however. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p23.59">Examination of the data has indicated that there are no clear outliers or unusual results that need to be removed or examined in more detail. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p23.59">This would indicate that the data is reasonably reliable and has been collected relatively carefully. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p23.59">However, there is one anomaly with the data that stands out. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p23.59">PEmax appears to have been rounded to the nearest five as almost all the measurements are presented in that format. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p23.59">While rounding could lose some of the data, it is mostly likely to be a result of the reading of the measuring apparatus in taking PEmax and the data can only be given accurately to the nearest 5. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p23.59">The immediate concern with this is the measurement for patient 16, where the value of PEmax was given as 134cm H <hi rend="sub">2</hi>O, not to the nearest five. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p23.59">While this could be the result of an error it is worrying because it could indicate that this measurement was taken in a different manner or by a different person than the rest of the subjects. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p23.59">This raises some doubts over the reliability of the data. </s>
</p>
<p n="p24.59">
<s n="s1.8;p24.59">One oddity of the data is with the lung volume variables. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p24.59">Total Lung Capacity, in ml, is the volume of the lungs following a maximal breath in, so should be the maximal volume of the lungs. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p24.59">Residual Volume, in ml, is the volume of the lungs following a maximal breath out, so should be the minimum volume remaining in the lungs at any time. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p24.59">The Functional Residual Capacity should be between these two measurements. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p24.59">However, in the data provided, the greatest of the lung volume measurements is always RV - the Residual Volume. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p24.59">This can be seen by looking at the summary of the lung volume relationships above - RV is always much greater than the Total Lung Capacity. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p24.59">This is extremely puzzling, as the Residual Volume should always be less than the Total Lung Capacity. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p24.59">Since RV is greater than the other measurements in all cases, it seems most likely that the data has been mislabelled and RV is actually the Total Lung Capacity. </s>
</p>
<p n="p25.59">
<s n="s1.7;p25.59">Some indication of the reliability can be provided by looking at the correlation of the variables. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p25.59">While none of the variables are repeated measurements, many of them are intended to measure the same underlying features - notably a patient's level of malnutrition and their lung volume. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p25.59">Therefore you would expect a high level of correlation between these variables. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p25.59">While height, weight, BMI and BMP all correlate fairly strongly, suggesting that the data for malnutrition is fairly reliable, this is not the same for the lung volume variables. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p25.59">FEV1 through TLC are all intended to measure a patient's lung volume, but there seems to be little agreement between FEV1 and the other variables. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p25.59">While RV, FRC and TLC are correlated to some degree, there is even some evidence of negative correlation between FEV1 and these variables. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p25.59">This is a cause for concern and could indicate that the lung volume data is not all that reliable. </s>

<s n="s4.6;p39.59">As has already been seen, some of the variables correlate extremely highly with other variables in the data set - notably age, height, weight and BMI. Since there are strong linear relationships between these variables, it becomes extremely difficult to get regression coefficient estimates for these variables and using several collinear variables in a regression is inadvisable [5, pg. </s>

<s n="s2.5;p40.59">This seems to indicate that each of these variables can be described by a linear combination of the others and makes it inadvisable to include several of them in a multiple regression of PEmax. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p40.59">The strong collinearity makes sense, as a patient's body mass index is derived from a patient's height and weight and a patient's BMP is derived from their body mass index and their age, so there would be a linear relationship between all these variables. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p40.59">In fact, from the correlation between age, height, weight and BMI, only one of these variables should probably be included in the regression analysis. </s>

<s n="s3.6;p44.59">The same applies to RV, FRC and TLC. Since these variables all measure the same underlying variable (malnutrition or lung volume), it does not matter which is selected to be included in the model. </s>
