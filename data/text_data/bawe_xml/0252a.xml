<s n="s1.5;p1.33">The conquest of Mexico poses a complex problem in history: how is it possible that a small band of Spanish explorers were able to conquer a Mesoamerican warlike and powerful society, on their own territory, in the space of just two years? </s>
<s n="s2.5;p1.33">As Prescott argues, 'There is probably no instance in history where so vast an enterprise has been achieved by means apparently so inadequate'.<ref target="BAWE_0252a-ftnote.001"/> The sixteenth-century notion that Europeans inevitably endure over native populations because of their inherent 'cultural superiority'<ref target="BAWE_0252a-ftnote.002"/> has, thankfully, come under criticism. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p1.33">Historians researching this period have put numerous other explanations forward. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p1.33">However, within the course of theories on military supremacy, victory by 'signs' and the part played by disease transfer, one enduring theme has been that it was Hernán Cortés whose leadership acted as the crucial factor enabling the Spanish conquest to occur. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p1.33">Yet this is by no means a confirmed notion and is surrounded by years of historical debate. </s>

<p n="p2.33">
<s n="s1.4;p2.33">An important factor one must consider within this framework is how we know about and understand these events. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p2.33">For many years Spanish accounts held a complete monopoly and Cortés' own letters to the King have had a crucial place in the record of the conquest. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p2.33">More recently emerging accounts taken from the Indian perspective have admittedly gone some way to redress the balance. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p2.33">However such post-conquest records, laden with omen and prophecy are not enough to explain the Spanish success, and the fact remains that the best records we have (and those which historians have tended to refer to) are Cortés' letters, the account by Cortés' chaplain and secretary Francisco Lopéz de Gómara and Diáz' <hi rend="italic">True History</hi>. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.33">
<s n="s1.3;p3.33">This reliance upon select accounts has created the potential for bias in our understanding of the role played by different factors in the conquest. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p3.33">It is fairly obvious an assumption to say that, in his commentary, Cortés may have coloured what actually happened with his own thoughts and assumptions, as well as perhaps exaggerating the extent to which his presence was pivotal. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p3.33">This seems particularly illuminating when one considers that Cortés was acting in rebellion against the authority granted to him by Velazquez in Cuba.<ref target="BAWE_0252a-ftnote.003"/> In his desire to construct an image of himself, to the King, as a credible leader, it seems plausible that he may have omitted evidence that works to the contrary. </s>

</p>
</note>
<p n="p4.33">
<s n="s1.3;p4.33">However Cortés' own account is not the only area of questionable accuracy among the historian's sources for this event. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p4.33">As his personal secretary and, as many historians have pointed out, somebody who was not actually present during the conquest, Gómara's version of events also has to be treated with caution. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p4.33">Díaz' insistence that Gómara placed too much power in the lap of Cortés has rubbed off among historians, who have tended to view the former as the more reliable account. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.33">
<s n="s1.6;p5.33">However, Iglesia argues that it too suffers similar problems of bias, this time being coloured by the desire to increase awareness of the role played by the ordinary soldiers. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p5.33">Underlying his narrative is the continual presence of resentment towards the idea that Cortés' skills alone completed the conquest and, in turn, that Gómara completely ignores the role played by the men. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p5.33">As a result, in his efforts to discredit this work, Díaz destroys confidence in his own, through his constant use of the first person plural, which makes Cortés merely 'a tool in the hands of his captains'<ref target="BAWE_0252a-ftnote.004"/>. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p5.33">Díaz claims that Cortés' soldiers and captains were fundamental in decision-making, a theme recurring throughout his work.<ref target="BAWE_0252a-ftnote.005"/> We might ask if this type of consultation is likely. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p5.33">In general one would probably say no, war not being the time for democracy and debate, but it is possible that those who participated in conquest expeditions were treated in different manner to the ordinary soldier.<ref target="BAWE_0252a-ftnote.006"/> However, in this dangerous and dynamic situation, encountered by an army with little formal hierarchy, it seems most plausible that decisions must <hi rend="italic"> ultimately</hi> lay with the leader of the expedition, regardless of whether or not he consulted before making them. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p5.33">Perhaps because Cortés had so great an ability to inspire his men with devotion to his plans that they, including Díaz, took them on as their own.<ref target="BAWE_0252a-ftnote.007"/> What this tells us, then, is that Díaz' work, if taken as accurate, may <hi rend="italic">disguise</hi> the extent to which Cortés leadership was crucial<ref target="BAWE_0252a-ftnote.008"/>, and this is something we must bare in mind in using his chronicles to understand the events. </s>

<s n="s1.8;p8.33">It has been noted that Cortés' skills in the battlefield were perhaps not those we would expect from someone we have come to see as one of the greatest military leaders. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p29.33">One's conclusions, then, about the role of Cortés, like the sources from which they derive, will always tend toward the subjective because it is hard to establish an objective, scientific kind of history from data so laden with bias and agenda.<ref target="BAWE_0252a-ftnote.067"/> It does however, seem sensible to assume that where Cortés and Gómara may have over-emphasised the importance of the former's leadership, Díaz probably under-estimated it. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p29.33">Although common soldiers undeniably carried out the conquest, it is perhaps unlikely that they could have done so without the presence of Cortés' leadership, which 'gave them ideals and guided their energies'<ref target="BAWE_0252a-ftnote.068"/>. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p30.33">Cortés was a master of human communication and it seems to have been his grasp of the symbolic that was crucial to the conquest. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p30.33">His talent for great speeches, filled with words of honour and religious commitment, not only saved him the loss of potential deserters at many points throughout the campaign, but also roused confidence in his leadership. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p30.33">Many of the ideas Cortés communicated were beliefs his men already held as part of their inherent notion of European cultural superiority. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p30.33">Yet it was Cortés ability to exploit such cultural circumstances that created the unity and dedication that gave the Europeans their advantage. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p30.33">Thus, to give an example, while the Spanish must be viewed as forever indebted to their Indian allies, it was Cortés' genius that obtained command of them and that united this army, of such gaping cultural commitments, to fight devotedly, and as one, for the cause he so deeply felt. </s>
</p>
<p n="p31.33">
<s n="s1.3;p31.33">As a leader, his determination never waned, even after his troops' expulsion from Mexico, and all negotiations were carried out by him. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p31.33">Cortés was a master at performing great accomplishments with limited resources available to him, and his astuteness at some of the key moments in this campaign was that of 'great men', rarely seen throughout history<ref target="BAWE_0252a-ftnote.069"/>. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p31.33">His ability to adapt to whatever circumstances lay before him was perhaps his most commanding talent and saved the conquest from termination and disaster at many points, such as after the Noche Triste or on the arrival of Narvaez. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p32.33">It seems likely that this improvisation, in the face of the Aztec ritualised way of understanding, was what offered the Spanish their chance of success. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p32.33">Although the Europeans military superiority was vast, and disease weakened their opposition, they perhaps might have been defeated if the Aztecs, and more importantly perhaps, Moctezuma, had been able to modify their behaviour and responses with changed circumstances, in the way that Cortés was able to. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p32.33">Perhaps paralysed by the belief that Cortés was a returning god, or perhaps simply unable to fit the newcomers into their cyclical way of understanding, Moctezuma first, and warriors on the battlefield later, cannot grasp the conquest as a unique event. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p32.33">Where Cortés is affected by, and grows into, his environment, the Aztecs are bound by religion and tradition to behaviour that consistently leaves them at a disadvantage, both in battle and diplomacy. </s>

<p n="p33.33">
<s n="s1.4;p33.33">What Díaz perhaps offers us is a realistic version of the extent to which Cortés' leadership was key to the conquest. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p33.33">We must attempt to see a real commander rather than the literary hero figure we hold in our imagination, a man who was indeed assisted by what fate provided him, but who still exemplifies extraordinary tenacity, ability to inspire and sharp-witted improvisation. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p33.33">Even though other crucial factors tended to fall to the Spanish advantage, without a figure of this ability leading the expedition, it seems likely that, at one of the several occasions where the Spanish are left vulnerable, the conquest would have been aborted. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p33.33">The story of the conquest is therefore inevitably the story of Cortés because he is 'not merely the soul, but the body, of the enterprise, present everywhere in person'.<ref target="BAWE_0252a-ftnote.070"/> Although the circumstances in existence without doubt worked to the benefit of the Europeans, it required a leader like Cortés to exploit them and to ensure the success of the Spanish conquest of Mexico. </s>
