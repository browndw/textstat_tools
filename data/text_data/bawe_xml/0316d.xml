<s n="s1.2;p2.52">Does globalisation, as asserted by its opponents, cost job in Britain? </s>
<s n="s2.2;p2.52">To address this issue, we first need to clarify what processes should be considered as globalisation here. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.52">
<s n="s1.4;p3.52">Globalisation has in the past decade become a popular concept widely used in explaining many different phenomena. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p3.52">Central to this notion is the increased interdependency between national societies due to the improvement of communication and transportation technology, but the manifestations of this trend vary widely, and cause the formulation of a definition applicable in all discussions extremely difficult. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p3.52">Current discussion of globalisation includes three dimensions: economic, cultural, and political (see table A). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p3.52">Such a wide scope and complexity of the processes discussed as part of globalisation make any claim of its general effect on any subject over-simplistic, and calls for more sophisticated analyses that 'unpack' the notion of globalisation and give different factors individual assessment. </s>

<p n="p5.52">
<s n="s1.3;p5.52">Among the various aspects of globalisation, we first focus on the "increase of cross- border <hi rend="italic">flows</hi> of market factors, e.g., goods, capital and labour" in this study, and use the national statistics on <hi rend="italic">trade, capital flow</hi> (specially the amount of foreign direct investment<ref target="BAWE_0316d-ftnote.001"/>) and <hi rend="italic">migration flow</hi> to measure it. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p5.52">The three factors are chosen because they are most often mentioned in public discussions of labour market outcomes, and thus have greatest relevance to the current debate. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p5.52">In the past few decades, the shares of the three factors in either GDP or population have all been increased considerably (see Figure 1-3, next page). </s>

</note>
<p n="p6.52">
<s n="s1.4;p6.52">Conventional discussions found in media and political debates usually focus on the direct effects of the components of the three factors that are more visible from the domestic perspective, such as the number of jobs created by inward FDI, the number of jobs lost in the layoffs accompanying corporate 'downsizing' and 'outsourcing,' and the competition with the imports from low-wage counties and foreign immigrant. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p6.52">Such an approach has two major shortcomings. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p6.52">First, it does not count in the contribution of outward components, namely export, emigrants, and some outward FDI (see Table B). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p6.52">Second, analyses in this current, while based on the number of job created and cost directly, tend to overlook other indirect influence on the whole labour market. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p7.52">To avoid the two faults, we take a different approach in this study. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p7.52">First, to obtain a better-balanced assessment of the increase of cross-border flows of market factors, we draw the key indicators of each factor from the statistics of both inward and outward components in our major analysis. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p7.52">Second, to include the indirect effect into our assessment of employment condition, we rely on the aggregate indicators of labour market instead of the counts of job loss or job gain associated with individual events. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.52">
<s n="s1.1;p8.52">In summary, we intend to address whether globalisation cost job in Britain by investigating whether the increase in cross-border flows of goods, capital, and labour had had caused adverse impacts on the employment statistics of British labour market. </s>

<s n="s2.4;p12.52">
<hi rend="italic">National analysis</hi> is aimed to address the main thesis by investigating how the changes in the quantities of international trade, FDI, and migration flow are associated with the change in gross employment rate (and that of each age group) at national level. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p12.52">This approach constitutes the main part of this research, but is at the risk to be restricted by the limited sample size of annual national data (available since 1959, N = 42). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p12.52">Therefore, we incorporate <hi rend="italic">industry analysis</hi> as a supplementary analysis, which utilizes the industry-specific data on trade and employment to test the association between the changes of the two. </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.52">
<s n="s1.2;p13.52">Despite the shifted scopes and focuses of the two approaches, the logics behind their design are basically the same. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p13.52">Therefore I will only focus on national analysis to be discussed in detail in the following sections, and leave the industry analysis to be addressed shortly in the end with emphasis on its difference from the national analysis. </s>

<p n="p17.52">
<s n="s1.2;p17.52">The indicators chosen as measures of the "cross-border <hi rend="italic">flows</hi> of goods, capital, and labour" are quite straightforward except FDI. We specially focus on FDI for the capital part because, as illustrated by Albowd and Freeman (1992), "we want to distinguish a foreign capital investment that is a long-term job creating from a short-run financial flow" and "direct foreign investment is job creating while currency transaction are likely to be short run." </s>

<s n="s2.6;p18.52">First, we regard the <hi rend="italic">net</hi> values of certain factors as source for measures of other concepts, perhaps, indicators of how attractive one nation is regarding the respective factor. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p18.52">Although the growth of those net values are certainly <hi rend="italic">enabled</hi> by the process of globalisation, they still can not be appropriate measures of globalisation since the net flow of certain factor of one country could be zero even when the economy of this country is highly internationally connected. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p18.52">Second, we do not consider the stock of immigrants as an index of globalisation because there have long been societies constituted primarily of immigrants, most of whom would eventually be granted citizenship and considered a legitimate part of this society. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p18.52">In other words, we don't consider migration itself as a process of globalisation, but the increase of migration flow is. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p18.52">In contrast, the stock of FDI <hi rend="italic">may</hi> have its significant meaning in the discussion of globalisation, but that should be left for other researches to explore. </s>

<s n="s2.5;p52.52">National analysis investigates how the change in gross flows of trade, FDI and migration, as shares of GDP and population respectively, are associated with the changes of the national employment rate of British workforce and those of different age groups. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p52.52">Industry analysis, based on the comparable industry-specific data on trade and employment since 1990s, explore the association between the changes of the two factors. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p52.52">Both analyses are to certain degree restricted in terms of data availability and the applicability of findings. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p52.52">Nonetheless, both can still provide valuable information in responding to current debate. </s>
