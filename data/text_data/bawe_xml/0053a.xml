<s n="s4.4;p13.19">Improvement in the Balance of Payment position of a number of countries following devaluation was also helped by the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950 which raised the level of world demand considerably.<ref target="BAWE_0053a-ftnote.007"/> European production continued to expand thereby reducing the region's dependence on foreign goods especially those of the US.
