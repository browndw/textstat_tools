<p n="p1.40">
<s n="s1.2;p1.40">There are both important similarities and differences between the conquest of Mexico and the landing of Europeans in North America. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p1.40">The Spanish and the English became the dominant powers in Mexico and North America respectively and would therefore determine the fate of the Indians in Mexico and North America in the coming years. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.40">
<s n="s1.5;p2.40">There was an enormous difference in the speed in which the natives of North America were subdued compared to the Aztecs in Mexico. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p2.40">The Spanish first conquered the Aztecs (which took only two years) and then began to settle their people; the Europeans who entered North America first settled part of the land and then instigated the conquest of the continent as they progressed westward over two hundred years. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p2.40">Consequently contemporaries would view the two processes in a different light; Cortez's expedition into Mexico is nearly always called by chroniclers and historians "The Conquest of Mexico." </s>
<s n="s4.5;p2.40">This reflects the fact that the Spanish conquest of Mexico was a definitive defeat of the most influential native power in America at the time. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p2.40">In comparison historians describe the arrival of Europeans in North America as a settling or planting because it was a steady but ongoing process that didn't initially involve the subduing of any significant society comparable with the Aztecs. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.40">
<s n="s1.7;p3.40">There are a number of factors which influenced the interaction between the Europeans and the Native Americans. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p3.40">The most important issue to consider is what the Europeans wanted and expected from America and the reasons they left their homelands for the "New World." </s>
<s n="s3.7;p3.40">Their reaction to what they found in America would influence further European actions there. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p3.40">The attitudes and opinions of the Europeans towards the Native Americans and the attitudes and opinions of the Native Americans towards the Europeans were also significant in determining their interactions. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p3.40">A number of alliances were formed between the Europeans and the natives and these also influenced the course of events. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p3.40">Whilst the European powers in both North America and Mexico had distinct advantages over the native populations, such as superior weaponry, the natives themselves had different advantages such as knowledge of the landscape and initial superiority in numbers. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p3.40">Some investigation is required to determine the balance of these strengths and how they would influence the outcome of the conflicts between natives and Europeans. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.40">
<s n="s1.2;p4.40">It was the aims of the Europeans, modified by what they found in America that would determine their actions in the New World. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p4.40">The desire for gold would be the primary drive for the Spanish conquest of Mexico, whereas other nations became interested primarily in trade and settling after they found no gold in North America. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.40">
<s n="s1.8;p5.40">Hernan Cortez, the leader of the Spanish conquistadores in Mexico, intended to collect more gold than the first two Spanish voyages to the Yucatan made in the 1510s. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p5.40">Yet Cortez's force was not equipped for a march into the centre of Mexico. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p5.40">Cortez drew much of his assessment of the Aztec's defensive capabilities from the first two voyages to the Yucatan made by Juan de Grijalva and Francisco Hernandez de Cordoba. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p5.40">These expeditions found only traces of gold and merely succeeded in angering the native Maya population. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p5.40">However, when Cortez landed in the Yucatan, the Maya did not produce sufficient resistance to dishearten him. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p5.40">Some of Cortez's men had been on one of the first two voyages and so had first hand experience. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p5.40">Cortez's force of about six-hundred, several horses, cannon, guns and armour landed in the Yucatan in 1519. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p5.40">When Cortez met the Aztec royal ambassador he exclaimed, 'We Spaniards have a disease of the heart that only gold can cure.' <ref target="BAWE_0280a-ftnote.001"/> </s>

<s n="s1.4;p6.40">The French became interested in the New World after French pirates intercepted Spanish treasure ships bringing gold back from the Aztec empire in Mexico. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p6.40">Additionally, the Frenchmen Verrazano and Cartier began to explore the North American coast and the St Lawrence during the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p6.40">Although the French were initially enticed to America by the prospect of finding gold, they found few traces of gold in North America at that time. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p6.40">Instead they found Indian populations who would trade beaver furs (a luxury in Europe) for European goods. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.40">
<s n="s1.4;p7.40">The very first English colonies established by Sir Walter Raleigh in 1585 and 1587 were made to challenge the domination Spain had in the Americas. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p7.40">However, these had disappeared when John White, an English cartographer returned to re-supply them.<ref target="BAWE_0280a-ftnote.002"/> Many historians have speculated as to the fate of the colonists, but one of the most prominent theories is that they were wiped out by hostile Indians in the area. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p7.40">The more successful English settlement of Virginia (from 1607) was threatened by local tribes. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p7.40">Crucially, the English settlers of Virginia were often given unrealistic expectations by those who encouraged them to go and believed the New World to be a paradise. </s>

<s n="s2.4;p8.40">These expeditions, led first by Henry Hudson in 1609 (an Englishman in the service of the Dutch East Indian Company), were smaller in size than those of the English and French. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p8.40">Hudson sailed up the river later named after him and met Indians who traded tobacco for knives and beads. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p8.40">Trade became the main reason the Dutch would now attempt to colonize America. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.40">
<s n="s1.4;p9.40">Land became the most important English acquisition in America. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p9.40">The English came to colonize the coastal region to be used as farmland and the maintenance of livestock. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p9.40">When the Spanish found gold in America, they increased their efforts in the New World to find more; when the English found 'free' land in North America (as the natives there didn't claim ownership), they expanded to find more. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p9.40">Land became for the English in the 1600s what gold was for the Spanish in the 1500s; a primary drive for sending their people to America. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p10.40">The attitudes of the European invaders towards the Native Americans varied. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p10.40">When Europeans came into contact with the Native Americans, taking note of their tribal dances, their more primitive weapons and agriculture and religious beliefs and practices, they often classified them as savages; strange and uncivilized people who were not as "human" as white Europeans. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p10.40">These opinions were reflected in literature at the time. </s>

<s n="s2.10;p11.40">The natives in both Mexico and North America often viewed the Europeans as gods due to their light skin complexions. ' When Cortez first arrived in Mexico, Montezuma, the Aztec emperor, believed him to be the returning god Quetzalcoatl. </s>

<s n="s6.10;p11.40">Cortez's appearance also happened to match the description of Quetzalcoatl in Aztec myth and as Michael Woods points out, myth was a very important part of Aztec society.<ref target="BAWE_0280a-ftnote.008"/> Cortez discovered Montezuma's misunderstanding of the nature of the Spanish through the gifted translator, Malinche, whom the Maya had given to him after he had defeated them when he initially arrived in the Yucatan. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p11.40">Whilst the Aztecs greeted the Spaniards with lavish gifts of food and golden idols, they treated them with suspicion and asked them to move their camp 'seven leagues away,'<ref target="BAWE_0280a-ftnote.009"/> and asked the Spaniards not to come to Tenochtitlan. </s>

<s n="s3.4;p15.40">This may demonstrate a different attitude between the Spanish and the other Europeans towards the worth of Indians as labourers; however, Cortez was cut off from the European world so he was forced to use native porters instead of European ones. </s>
