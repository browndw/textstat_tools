<p n="p1.57">
<s n="s1.2;p1.57">The purpose of the experiment was to understand the indirect heating system of UHT milk treatment, to analysis milk properties, colour, flavour, microbiological and quality attributes with respect to UHT treatments. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p1.57">During the practical, indirect heating system in the pilot plant was used. </s>
</p>

<div1 type="section">
<head rend="underlined bold">INTRODUCTION</head>
<p n="p2.57">
<s n="s1.4;p2.57">Ultra High Temperature (UHT) is a continuous process that involves rapid heating to high temperatures (about 140 <hi rend="sup">0</hi>C), holding for short period of time (1 to 10s) and rapidly cooling. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p2.57">While pasteurization conditions effectively eliminate potential pathogenic micro organisms, it is not sufficient to inactivate the thermoresistant spores in milk. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p2.57">The term sterilization refers to the complete elimination of all microorganisms. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p2.57">The food industry uses the more realistic term commercial sterilization, a product is not necessarily free of all microorganisms, but those that survive the sterilization process are unlikely to grow during storage and cause product spoilage. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.57">
<s n="s1.9;p3.57">In canning, the objective is to ensure the cold spot has reached the desired temperature for the desired time. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p3.57">With most canned products, there is a low rate of heat penetration to the thermal centre. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p3.57">This leads to overprocessing of some portions, and damage to nutritional and sensory characteristics, especially near the walls of the container. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p3.57">This implies long processing times at lower temperatures. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p3.57">Milk can be made commercially sterile by subjecting it to temperatures in excess of 100° C, and packaging it in air-tight containers. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p3.57">The milk may be packaged either before or after sterilization. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p3.57">The basis of UHT is the sterilization of food before packaging, then filling into pre-sterilized containers in a sterile atmosphere. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p3.57">Milk that is processed in this way using temperatures exceeding 135° C, permits a decrease in the necessary holding time (to 2-5 s) enabling a continuous flow operation. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p3.57">Some examples of food products processed with UHT are liquid products e.g. milk, juices, cream, yoghurt, wine, salad dressings, foods with discrete particles e.g. baby foods, tomato products, fruits and vegetables juices, soups and larger particles e.g. stews (<seg type="URL" n="http://www.foodsci.uoguelph.ca/dairyedu/uht.html"/>). </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.57">
<s n="s1.5;p4.57">There are two principal methods of UHT treatment i.e. direct and indirect heating. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p4.57">Direct heating system, the product is heated by direct contact with steam of potable or culinary quality. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p4.57">The main advantage of direct heating is that the product is held at the elevated temperature for a shorter period of time. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p4.57">For a heat-sensitive product such as milk, this means less damage. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p4.57">Also there are two method of direct heating system which are injection and infusion. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.57">
<s n="s1.4;p5.57">Injection - High pressure steam is injected into pre-heated liquid by a steam injector leading to a rapid rise in temperature. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p5.57">After holding, the product is flash-cooled in a vacuum to remove water equivalent to amount of condensed steam used. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p5.57">This method allows fast heating and cooling, and volatile removal, but is only suitable for some products. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p5.57">It is energy intensive and because the product comes in contact with hot equipment, there is potential for flavour damage. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.57">
<s n="s1.4;p6.57">Infusion - Food in a free falling film is pumped into a chamber of high pressure steam. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p6.57">The time of the fall matches the desired holding time. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p6.57">The product, therefore, falls onto a cooled surface, followed by flash cooling in vacuum chamber. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p6.57">This method has several advantages which includes instantaneous heating and rapid cooling, no localized overheating or burn-on, and suitable for low and higher viscosity products </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.57">
<s n="s1.2;p7.57">Indirect heating systems the heating medium and product are not in direct contact, but separated by equipment contact surfaces. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p7.57">Several types of heat exchangers are used which are plates, tubular, scraped surface and double-cone heat exchangers. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p36.57">According to the results above, milk analysis was done by performing alcohol test. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p36.57">It is shown that alcohol stability falls with addition of CaCl <hi rend="sub">2</hi> because of the pH drop. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p36.57">Usually good quality raw milk its alcohol stability is within 80-100%. </s>

<s n="s5.6;p36.57">Alcohol stability indicates of milk to heat treatment. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p36.57">It can be concluded that as the quality of raw milk deteriorates, also alcohol stability drops. </s>
</p>
<p n="p37.57">
<s n="s1.4;p37.57">For the case of milk properties, theoretically addition of CaCl <hi rend="sub">2</hi> shouldn't affect milk composition in terms of fat and proteins. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p37.57">From the table, it's shown that there are variations for fat, protein and lactose for different milk samples due to addition of CaCl <hi rend="sub">2.</hi> </s>
<s n="s3.4;p37.57">This can be most probably due to experimental errors. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p37.57">But FPD was increasing on addition of CaCl <hi rend="sub">2</hi> indicates the temperature of which milk will freeze and pH was dropping, which indicates the milk was becoming more acidic. </s>
</p>
<p n="p38.57">
<s n="s1.1;p38.57">In terms of flavour, mouth feel and colour, UHT has the flavour of cooked cabbage which is due to removal of volatile compound and formation of reducing sulphur compounds(H <hi rend="sub">2</hi>S , sulphydryl groups) due to denaturation of proteins and lipids which causes formation of ketones and lactones. </s>

<p n="p39.57">
<s n="s1.6;p39.57">Untreated milk i.e. without addition of heat treatment was yellowish/ cream in colour. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p39.57">While the colour of UHT milk is much whiter as compared to raw milk and this is due to increased size of the casein micelles and presence of Lactulose due to heat treatment. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p39.57">Lactulose is also used as an indicator of heat treatment of UHT &amp; sterilized milk as well as to categorize the severity of heat treatment (the higher the quantity lactulose present, the higher the heat treatment used). </s>
<s n="s4.6;p39.57">Mouth feel of UHT milk was increased greatly on addition of CaCl <hi rend="sub">2</hi>. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p39.57">This is because CaCl <hi rend="sub">2</hi> causes drop in pH, increases ionic stability of Ca <hi rend="sup">2+</hi> in milk and consequently causes casein micelles to be more stable and also addition of CaCl <hi rend="sub">2</hi> promotes fat molecules in milk to behave like casein micelles. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p56.57">The F-value indicates effect of a heat treatment, which is governed by the product heating temperature and the time during which the product is held at this temperature (product holding time). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p56.57">F-value can be interpreted as the time required obtaining a given reduction in the number of micro-organisms. </s>

<s n="s3.3;p57.57">Although UHT processing has advantages and disadvantages as discussed above, still UHT processed food products stands in a good position of improved quality image and longer shelf life with storage at ambient temperature. </s>
