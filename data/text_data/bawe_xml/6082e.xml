<s n="s1.1;p4.26">Water of higher temperatures (from Table 1, a range from 33.0 to 90.0 <hi rend="sup"> o</hi>C) collected in the beaker is likely to evaporate slightly in transfer before weighing, plus there is a short walking distance between the water collection point and the weighing - electronic scale. </s>

<p rend="bulleted" n="p5.26">
<s n="s1.1;p5.26">This can be minimised by keeping the same walking pace of the same person from collection to weighing; the same accurate electronic scale is used throughout the practical. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p6.26">For improvement, ideally is to have the scale placed beneath the beaker while water emerging, thus will be able to record the immediate water mass with minimum loss through evaporation. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p14.26">(p.8 - Table 4) </s>
<s n="s2.2;p14.26">Since the two sets of glass thermal conductivity values (k), which vary from 0.319 to 0.413 W <hi rend="sup">-1</hi> m <hi rend="sup">-1 o</hi>C <hi rend="sup">-1</hi>, match with the literature value of 0.1 to 1.0 W <hi rend="sup">-1</hi> m <hi rend="sup">-1</hi> K <hi rend="sup">-1</hi>, I can conclude that this practical was carried out reasonably accurately that to overcome the limitations would have been accounted. </s>
