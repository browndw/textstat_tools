</p>
<p n="p3.88">
<s n="s1.3;p3.88">One such classical model is the Drude model, which is employed in this investigation. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p3.88">For comparison, the Sommerfeld model will also be considered; the Sommerfeld model was an early free electron model which applied quantum mechanical concepts. </s>

<head rend="bold">2.1 The Drude Model</head>
<p n="p4.88">
<s n="s1.3;p4.88">Drude was the first simple classical model for a free electron gas in a metal. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p4.88">He constructed the model by applying the kinetic theory of gases to a metal. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p4.88">The model remains useful, despite some fairly serious limitations, since it is the origin of some ideas still included in more complicated modern models. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.88">
<s n="s1.2;p5.88">Drude supposed that each of the metal's atoms contributes one or more valence electron to the so-called 'electron gas': these became the <hi rend="italic">conduction electrons</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p5.88">In this simplified model, Drude set up each electron with the kinetic energy relating to its three (classical) degrees of translational freedom, 3/2 <hi rend="italic">kBT</hi>, and the electron speeds were governed by the Boltzmann distribution. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.88">
<s n="s1.3;p6.88">Drude also supposed that the free electrons are scattered via random collisions with the metallic ion cores. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p6.88">After a collision, any drift velocity 'built up' in the direction of an applied field is effectively lost. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p6.88">As a result, the larger the mean free time, or scattering time Ï„, between collisions, the greater the influence of such a field will be. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.88">
<s n="s1.1;p7.88">Importantly, the only interactions between electrons and ions considered in this model are collisions: there are no other electron-ion interactions, and no electron-electron interactions. </s>

<head rend="bold">2.2 The Sommerfeld Model</head>
<p n="p8.88">
<s n="s1.2;p8.88">The Sommerfeld model was a later free electron model, and incorporated an element of quantum effects into its theory. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p8.88">Sommerfeld employed Fermi-Dirac statistics, and recognized that at 'ordinary' temperatures, most electrons in the metallic electron gas are many factors of <hi rend="italic">kBT</hi> below the Fermi energy. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.88">
<s n="s1.1;p9.88">These members cannot take part in a scattering collision to a slightly different energy, like those in the Drude model, since all such states are already occupied; further electrons occupying the same state is prohibited by the Pauli exclusion principle. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.88">
<s n="s1.2;p10.88">The outcome is that only a certain proportion of the electrons, that is, those near the Fermi energy, is capable of gradually responding to an external electrical field or thermal gradient. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p10.88">These then, in the Sommerfeld model, are the only electrons contribute to the macro-characteristics of a metal. </s>

<s n="s2.3;p84.88">The Sommerfeld model addresses some of the problems of the earlier model by including the Pauli exclusion principle: it gives a better account of thermal and electrical conductivity. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p84.88">In this investigation, however, the Sommerfeld model does not have a great advantage over the Drude model, since they both encounter problems regarding the Hall effect and magnetoresistance. </s>

<p n="p85.88">
<s n="s1.3;p85.88">The Hall angles predicted by theory and those obtained from the Drude model simulation agreed to within estimated error. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p85.88">The shortcoming here is that since the Drude model is only equipped to deal with negative charge carriers (that is, electrons), it cannot consider the Hall angles obtained with positive charge carriers (that is, holes). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p85.88">In the case of holes, the sign of the Hall angle would be reversed; there is no allowance for this in the Drude model. </s>

<p n="p86.88">
<s n="s1.3;p86.88">For metallic atoms with valences of 1 or 2, the model simulation gave accurate (to within estimated errors) Hall coefficients. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p86.88">However, for valences of 3, it gave Hall coefficients with the wrong sign. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p86.88">This is again due to the inability of the Drude model to take into account positive charge carriers. </s>
</p>
<p n="p87.88">
<s n="s1.4;p87.88">The Drude model gives no account of magnetoresistance, as it neglects electron-electron interactions. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p87.88">The Sommerfeld model similarly neglects these interactions, and so does not provide a suitable solution. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p87.88">Cyclotron frequency is shown by the model to be proportional to the applied magnetic field. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p87.88">If the frequency of the external AC electric field is varied, then cyclotron resonance can be obtained. </s>

<p n="p88.88">
<s n="s1.2;p88.88">The Drude model is therefore a simple and convenient one if applied with restrictions; these restrictions are formulated with an awareness of the shortcomings of the model, as discussed above. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p88.88">The cases where the Drude model (and the Sommerfeld model) cannot be applied, as in investigations into magnetoresistance, for example, must be approached with different, perhaps more elaborate, models: models which take into account the various effects which are neglected in the Drude and Sommerfeld approaches. </s>
