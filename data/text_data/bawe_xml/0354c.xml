<div1 type="section">
<p n="p1.8">
<s n="s1.2;p1.8">The Volkswagen Beetle was first built shortly before the Second World War but its design hardly changed for forty years. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p1.8">With its very distinctive shape and sound, it can be recognized throughout many countries, and its reliability means that many old Beetles are still on the roads today, advertising themselves as lasting models of economical, trustworthy and retro chic design. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.8">
<s n="s1.6;p2.8">The Volkswagen Beetle was in production from 1938 to 2003. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p2.8">The exact designer is unknown: Adolf Hitler commissioned a car to be built shortly before he came to power that would enable all Germans to be able to use this vehicle cheaply and easily. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p2.8">Ferdinand Porsche then designed this car - the Beetle - although a very similar design for such a car had been made by Joseph Ganz twenty years earlier. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p2.8">However, Ganz was Jewish and so all his projects were decommissioned and he fled the country and Porsche's design went ahead. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p2.8">The actual shape of the outside of the car, as opposed to the design of the revolutionary engine inside, was envisioned by Erwin Komenda (an original sketch of his below). </s>
<s n="s6.6;p2.8">The design was intended to hold two adults and three children, and carry them at speeds of up to 62 mph. </s>
</p>
<figure id="BAWE_0354c-pic.001"/>
<p n="p3.8">
<s n="s1.5;p3.8">The first models of the Volkswagen Beetle were slow to come into production as the factory producing them in Germany was only small. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p3.8">Thus many of the first Beetles produced were for military purposes as the Second World War started. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p3.8">Much of the design for the Beetle was inspired by another streamlined car of the time known as the Tatra (below). </s>
<s n="s4.5;p3.8">The Tatra company later sued Volkswagen who had to pay out three million Deutche Marks, leaving them with little money. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p3.8">Thus there was little money for development of the Beetle and for some years the design remained almost unchanged. </s>
</p>
<figure id="BAWE_0354c-pic.002"/>
<p n="p4.8">
<s n="s1.2;p4.8">Post-war, a British officer named Major Ivan Hirst took control of the German factory producing the Beetles. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p4.8">He convinced the British Army to buy a large number of these Beetles, and soon the Beetle's popularity was increasing immensely. </s>
</p>
<figure id="BAWE_0354c-pic.003"/>
<p n="p5.8">
<s n="s1.4;p5.8">It was in this post-war era that the Beetle really took off: it became a symbol of freedom, rebellion and modernism. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p5.8">Throughout the sixties and seventies it became heavily associated with Hippies and their fun-loving and revolutionary way of life, and captured the hearts of many. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p5.8">They were often painted in bright colours or even with pattern accentuating the psychedelic sixties movement (left and below). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p5.8">Heavy advertising campaigns also helped the Beetle's success, and today we still associate the Beetle with the sixty's Hippy and everything they stood for in these times of political and civil unrest. </s>
</p>
<figure id="BAWE_0354c-pic.004"/>
<figure id="BAWE_0354c-pic.005"/>
<p n="p6.8">
<s n="s1.3;p6.8">The Beetle was also a Hollywood star. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p6.8">In a series of Disney films, a white Beetle with the number 53 on the side was a car called Herbie the Love Bug (below) who was most famous in the UK and America, but Beetles featured in a number of other films in other countries such as Germany and Mexico. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p6.8">The Beetle was also the subject of a number of Pop Art pictures which helped to boost their popularity and association with new thinking and the Hippie movement (right). </s>
</p>
<figure id="BAWE_0354c-pic.006"/>
<p n="p7.8">
<s n="s1.4;p7.8">Today, the Volkswagen Beetle enjoys a new lease of life. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p7.8">After dwindling sales since the mid-seventies and factories slowly closing down, the last original Beetles were being produced in Mexico and the final Beetle left the Factory in Puebla, Mexico, on 30 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> July 2003, 65 years since the first ones were built in Nazi Germany. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p7.8">However, in the last decade, designers in California have been working on a new model based and the design of the original Beetle (below). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p7.8">The mechanics are completely reworked and bare no resemblance to the Beetle, but the shape of the outside of the New Beetle is rounded and symmetrical, and has the large wheel covers that characterised the original Beetle. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.8">
<s n="s1.3;p8.8">This New Beetle is as cool as Beetles ever were, and maintains the reliability and class status that Volkswagen have held for many years now. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p8.8">It maintains a retro-chic appeal and still comes in bright colours with matching interiors and a matching flower for the dashboard, again harking back to its Hippie roots. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p8.8">Although it is not yet as popular as the Beetle was in its heyday, it has regained its place in the British and American markets and is still seen as a design icon and a symbol of the past fifty years. </s>
