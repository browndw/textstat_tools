<p rend="ordered" n="p1.53">
<s n="s1.1;p1.53">Emo-tion is an idea for a retail shop based in the town of Cirencester. </s>
</p>
<p rend="ordered" n="p2.53">
<s n="s1.1;p2.53">Emo-tion takes advantage of a gap in the market for musical equipment and accessories aimed directly at 14-19 year olds. </s>
</p>
<p rend="ordered" n="p3.53">
<s n="s1.1;p3.53">There are many towns across the UK with no retail outlet aimed directly at this age range; the scope for growth is large. </s>
</p>
<p rend="ordered" n="p4.53">
<s n="s1.1;p4.53">Emo-tion is jointly owned by <name type="student name"/> and <name type="other"/>. <name type="student name"/> has retail experience and <name type="other"/> has run his own business for 16 years. </s>

<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">BACKGROUND</head>
<p n="p6.53">
<s n="s1.3;p6.53">The idea for Emo-tion was formed early this year when the need for a shop selling commodities aimed at 14-19 year old teenagers appeared in Cirencester. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p6.53">Local students at Cirencester College also felt that Cirencester needed an outlet where they could buy guitars, popular DC/Converse shoes and 'Emo' accessories. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p6.53">Emo is a name given to a fashion culture in teenage boys and girls which involves wearing dark clothing, studs, black make-up and customizing old clothes. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.53">
<s n="s1.1;p7.53">Emo-tion is a shop aimed to fill this gap in the market within the town of Cirencester and surrounding villages, with a combined estimated population of 40,000. </s>
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">THE PROPOSAL</head>
<p n="p8.53">
<s n="s1.4;p8.53">The market for the idea of Emo-tion is nearly completely open. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p8.53">There is no shop in Cirencester selling guitars or anything music related apart from CD's. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p8.53">There are however, shops selling music related products in Swindon (over 15 miles away). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p8.53">Market research has shown that the public would use Emo-tion over travelling to Swindon. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.53">
<s n="s1.2;p9.53">In the questionnaire for Emo-tion, 100% of people said they would visit and buy items from the shop. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p9.53">Emo accessories are also hard to come by in the local area and placing all these products under one roof would provide a unique selling point to the company. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.53">
<s n="s1.3;p10.53">Fashion trends currently have a life span of about 5 years. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p10.53">The company believes however that Emo-tion could adapt to any fashion change and still survive. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p10.53">A need for musical equipment will always exist and it is possible a contract could be set up with local schools to fulfil this need. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.53">
<s n="s1.1;p11.53">Appendix 2 contains Emo-tion's proposed products. </s>
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">THE MARKET</head>
<p n="p12.53">
<s n="s1.3;p12.53">For the musical market, Emo-tion will have 100% market share within the town of Cirencester. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p12.53">Emo-tion will have 80% of the Market for DC's and Converse shoes but only 20% for shoes in general, as there is competition already in Cirencester. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p12.53">Due to this, Emo-tion will only sell 'Emo' shoes. </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.53">
<s n="s1.2;p13.53">Most of Emo-tion's customers will be aged between 14 and 19. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p13.53">At peak times such as Christmas, we expect parents of this age group to purchase gifts from the shop. </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.53">
<s n="s1.2;p14.53">The store would be contemporary in its looks. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p14.53">The front of the shop would change every month, as market research has shown this to be effective. </s>
</p>
<quote lang="English">"Stores must be constantly changing their looks", says Denniston. "Printing innovations allow retailers to create large-format digital prints on interesting surfaces like wood and mesh, offering affordable ways to make a dramatic impact." -(<seg type="URL" n="http://www.allbusiness.com/periodicals/article/519678-1.html"/>)</quote>
<p n="p15.53">
<s n="s1.4;p15.53">By requesting local students to fill out a questionnaire, we have been able to discover Emo-tion would be used most in the winter. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p15.53">This enables us to plan our launch for mid-autumn. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p15.53">This launch time will ensure the shop is operating efficiently when winter comes. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p15.53">Financial forecasts also take this into account. </s>

<head>3) WHen would you use Emo-tion the most?</head>
</figure>
<p n="p16.53">
<s n="s1.2;p16.53">There is no competition in the musical market in Cirencester. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p16.53">Some competition exists for shoes from Clarks - but Emo-tion offers shoes aimed directly at the age range of 14-19; no other shop does this in Cirencester. </s>
</p>
<p n="p17.53">
<s n="s1.1;p17.53">In 5 years, no shop like Emo-tion has existed, apart from Willow which served the female 14-19 group. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p18.53">Competition in the same areas of Emo-tion would pose a possible threat. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p18.53">Thought has been given to ways to reduce this threat and one of the most favourable ways to do this was through a customer loyalty card. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p18.53">This card would act differently to most, instead of saving points and then being able to spend them on products in the store, our card would simply hold the total an individual had spent in Emo-tion and give discounts on most products on a sliding scale. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p18.53">This way if another shop did open up, customers would continue shopping in Emo-tion. </s>
</p>
<p n="p19.53">
<s n="s1.3;p19.53">We believe this will retain customer loyalty in the event competition opens up in the area. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p19.53">It will also increase customer satisfaction and keep customers coming back into store. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p19.53">This will help drive footfall, making any advertising in-store more effective. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p28.53">The third phase (after launch) will inform customers of 'deals' within the store. </s>
