<p n="p1.6">
<s n="s1.7;p1.6">Of the available questions, I have chosen question 2, which asks me to what extent the knowledge and skills I acquire in the study of one or both of my subject fields makes a contribution to human development. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p1.6">My first field of study is Japanese Language and Contemporary Culture, the second is Philosophy. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p1.6">I will concentrate on Language. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p1.6">I believe that the knowledge and skills I acquire will make a considerable development to my life as a human, but I am unable to say whether what I acquire during my study will affect human development as a whole. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p1.6">I will address the occurances in a human life, and distinguish what kinds of changes these are, obviously learning being one of them. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p1.6">Following this, suggestions as to what makes a good human life will be brought up. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p1.6">Finally, how the knowledge and skills I acquire contribute to my development as a human, will be criticized. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.6">
<s n="s1.12;p2.6">If I consider certain occurances throughout the stages of my life, there are many changes that have happened and made me what I am today, whatever that may be. </s>
<s n="s2.12;p2.6">Obviously, I have been born and for over 21 years I have gradually grown from being a small child to being what looks like a physically functional human adult male. </s>
<s n="s3.12;p2.6">Thus far I have gained the ability to walk, talk and acquired the knowledge of how to survive on my own. </s>
<s n="s4.12;p2.6">I have also experienced many things inbetween, like having attended a live performance or two, having participated in a national schooling system (and subsequently, an international one), which, amongst other things, honed my ability to speak English as well as Dutch. </s>
<s n="s5.12;p2.6">I could go on, but the mentioned occurances; palpable changes, should suffice to be catagorised into certain catagories around development. </s>
<s n="s6.12;p2.6">Being a product of evolution, I would say that being conceived can count as a <hi rend="italic">substantial change</hi>, and being unaware of the way of death, I might return to the earth when I die becoming, within time, some kind of fertiliser for soil. </s>
<s n="s7.12;p2.6">I was not and will not be, assuming the latter, as I am now; recognisable as a human. </s>
<s n="s8.12;p2.6">Attending concerts, has not really affected me in any significant way. </s>
<s n="s9.12;p2.6">They might have been inspiring, entertaining, exciting, etc. but they have left me the same as I was before I attended the concert thus falling under the category of being <hi rend="italic">accidental changes</hi>. </s>
<s n="s10.12;p2.6">Gaining the ability to walk, to speak a language and now being able to feed myself and effectively live a little longer until I do so next time, are much less noticable in terms of both the physical and mental than substantial changes. </s>
<s n="s11.12;p2.6">Contrarily, these changes are a lot more substantial than accidental changes, as I certainly have remained recognisably the same, but these changes have contributed to my development as a human being. </s>
<s n="s12.12;p2.6">I have learned, and for the benefit of what one day will be an ending result; something recognisable as a fully functioning, adult human being. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.6">
<s n="s1.11;p3.6">A 'good human life' assumes a lot. </s>
<s n="s2.11;p3.6">Above all, it is subjective, because what might be considered a good human life to one person could very well be a very mediocre human life to another. </s>
<s n="s3.11;p3.6">It really depends on where a person's standards lie, but there could be suggestions to what makes a human life good that are not specific enough to rule out some people. </s>
<s n="s4.11;p3.6">There should be suggestions that apply broadly enough to the majority to be considered ingredients to a good human life. </s>
<s n="s5.11;p3.6">The following suggestions are, arguably, some things that could make a human life good. </s>
<s n="s6.11;p3.6">Favourable and sustained relationships with the people in one's life, such as their family and friends. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p3.6">This assumes that one has family and friends, but a good relationship with these people, or any other people for that matter, ensures much emotional stability. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p3.6">A sufficient understanding of one's place in the world might offer inspiration as to which direction one would feel comfortable following. </s>
<s n="s9.11;p3.6">For one to have control over the affairs in one's life delivers a sense of satisfaction as it is a stage which has surpassed the majority of existentialist questions. </s>
<s n="s10.11;p3.6">A reasonable amount of leisure in one's life is healthy in that it provides encouragement to continue living, however, the responsibilities would be best being paid attention to. </s>
<s n="s11.11;p3.6">The attaining of skills, or rather attaining a sense of being skilled in some area, can be very satisfying, ofcourse, this requires one to learn these skills, which brings me to that very kind of development; learning. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.6">
<s n="s1.8;p4.6">Learning plays a large role in one's life. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p4.6">I doubt that it is possible for any functional human being who has ever lived to have not learned a thing throughout their lives. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p4.6">Much of learning is down to discovery, in which case it is an unplanned development, which is what kind of a change in a life learning is; a development. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p4.6">Learning, however, is not only mere discovery, but a search. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p4.6">Humanity has established learning institutions because it is human nature to seek knowledge. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p4.6">Philosophically, learning is defined as the process of knowing something and, thereafter, understanding something that one had no prior knowledge and understanding of. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p4.6">Learning is steadfast, unlike beliefs and opinions, which can very often be false. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p4.6">Using application to my first field of study, which is Japanese Language and Contemporary Culture, I will try to explain what the conventional theories behind knowledge and understanding are, so I can argue why I feel this field of study can contribute to my development as a human being. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.6">
<s n="s1.16;p5.6">Knowledge (of the propositional <hi rend="italic">p</hi> kind), initially, has what is called a <hi rend="italic">tripartite</hi> definition, which means that there are three parts to that definition. </s>
<s n="s2.16;p5.6">The first part of something to be considered knowledge; <hi rend="italic">p</hi> must be true. </s>
<s n="s3.16;p5.6">Language in itself is a kind of truth. </s>
<s n="s4.16;p5.6">There are general rules to sentence structures, grammar, etc. and certain words mean certain things. </s>
<s n="s5.16;p5.6">There are, as with all languages, exceptions to rules, but those exceptions are still knowable; they are established. </s>
<s n="s6.16;p5.6">The second part of the tripartite definition of knowledge is that the subject believes <hi rend="italic">p</hi>. </s>
<s n="s7.16;p5.6">It has been argued that belief in a proposition is not enough for all of a knowledge claim to be exactly that; a knowledge claim. </s>
<s n="s8.16;p5.6">The argument was that a belief in <hi rend="italic">p</hi> is insufficient and that absolute certainty is required, because one might be less ready to put forth a knowledge claim if one is less than certain of the claim; one can still believe <hi rend="italic">p</hi> with <hi rend="italic">p</hi> being false. </s>
<s n="s9.16;p5.6">However, certainty replacing belief is an quarrelsome argument that does not suffieciently justify why it should happen. </s>
<s n="s10.16;p5.6">The third of the tripartite definition is argued somewhat more. </s>
<s n="s11.16;p5.6">Initially, a subject must be able to justify <hi rend="italic">p</hi>. </s>
<s n="s12.16;p5.6">I can justify, thus far even, that the knowledge of the language I attain is true, simply by communicating with a native speaker of the language. </s>
<s n="s13.16;p5.6">However, there have been suggestions that would imply that the third part of the tripartite definition is volatile; that it needs to be something else. </s>
<s n="s14.16;p5.6">Some say that if the subject has come by <hi rend="italic">p</hi> through a reliable source, then that will suffice. </s>
<s n="s15.16;p5.6">In that case, I consider an established educational institution to be a reliable source. </s>
<s n="s16.16;p5.6">Another option is that <hi rend="italic">p</hi> causes one's belief in <hi rend="italic">p</hi>, so if <hi rend="italic">p</hi> was untrue one would not possibly believe <hi rend="italic">p</hi>. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.6">
<s n="s1.13;p6.6">Ultimately, something needs to be true in order for it to be a knowledge claim. </s>
<s n="s2.13;p6.6">Understanding is a different story though. </s>
<s n="s3.13;p6.6">Propositional knowledge is already a prerequisite for understanding. </s>
<s n="s4.13;p6.6">Practical knowledge would complete understanding, because with practical knowledge, one would be able to explain <hi rend="italic">p</hi>. </s>
<s n="s5.13;p6.6">One should be able to explain a proposition, which would imply knowing the proposition, and its nature in order to sufficiently be accepted as having an understanding of the proposition. </s>
<s n="s6.13;p6.6">I can know how to speak a language or know facts about the language's country of origin, but I can not understand the aspects of both if I am unable to explain why these aspects are the way they are. </s>
<s n="s7.13;p6.6">Still, acquiring the language I am currently attempting to acquire will result in me being able communicate more broadly, and I therefore consider it a significant development. </s>
<s n="s8.13;p6.6">I expect to understand it as well, and this opens up a door for being able to assist in the development of someone else, should they choose to accept my knowledge as justified, true belief. </s>
<s n="s9.13;p6.6">Thus, I will be feeding one of the suggestions that one would require to lead a good human life; maintaining healthy relationships with one's acquaintances, friends, family, etc.. </s>
<s n="s10.13;p6.6">The knowledge and skills I acquire in my fields of study will contribute greatly to my development as a human being. </s>
<s n="s11.13;p6.6">That same knowledge, however, has the potential to contribute to the development of other people. </s>
<s n="s12.13;p6.6">The same can be said of them, that their knowledge and skills will contribute to my development. </s>
<s n="s13.13;p6.6">This kind of 'mentor and apprentice' concept seems like a mass mutual contribution to human development. </s>
