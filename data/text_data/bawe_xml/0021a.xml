This causes the moment of the shaft about its fixture to the support to increase over the duration of a single experiment reading. Hence the torque applied falls with time because friction between the shaft and its bearings increases.

<s n="s1.4;p45.93">The mass was dropped from the same height for each reading. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p45.93">Given that time or distance is the measured variable, it is wiser to fix distance since one end of that distance can be a surface which the mass strikes, providing visual and audible information to stop the stopwatch. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p45.93">If time were elected to be fixed then some method of viewing exactly where the mass had reached after the control time would need to be devised. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p45.93">This is more complicated than the former method. </s>
</p>
<p n="p46.93">
<s n="s1.5;p46.93">One person positioned the hanging mass with reference to the ruler, which was placed against the vertical support, by viewing them perpendicularly in an attempt to minimize any error due to parallax. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p46.93">The disc was clamped to the support, by hand, to ensure (near) zero initial rotation. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p46.93">The stopwatch was started upon the release of the steel disc and stopped at the instant when the mass struck the work surface. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p46.93">The same person who released the disc with one hand started the stopwatch with their other hand. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p46.93">These two tasks were combined since the simultaneity of those events is more likely to be achieved if only one person is involved. </s>
</p>
<p n="p47.93">
<s n="s1.5;p47.93">The height from which the mass fell was made as large as possible but not so large that the mass hanger was in contact with the drum. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p47.93">Neither was it so large that the string was displaced from the grooves in the drum. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p47.93">The height used was 300mm. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p47.93">A relatively large height is favourable because the time taken for the weight to fall will increase as height increases, thus making time measurements easier to take accurately (it reduces the error in percentage terms). </s>
<s n="s5.5;p47.93">A short distance, and hence short travel time, would mean starting and stopping the stopwatch in quick succession which is more prone to error. </s>
</p>
<p n="p48.93">
<s n="s1.4;p48.93">In order to collect a wide range and sufficient number of results all possible arrangements of the masses were used. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p48.93">This allowed 6 different masses to be experimented with; 0.1, 0.12, 0.15, 0.17, 0.2, 0.22 (all in kilograms). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p48.93">For each mass three readings were taken. </s>

</p>
<p n="p49.93">
<s n="s1.6;p49.93">Since the two cogs on the steel disc's side of the support merely translated the torque from the drum's shaft to the disc's shaft, the distance 'little r' shown on the diagram on page 6 is equal to the radius of the drum. </s>
