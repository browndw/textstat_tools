<s n="s4.8;p9.69">In the cultural explanation, the hard-working of East Asian and close business relationship of the East Asian are helpful for its economic development. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p9.69">But if the geography, history and culture are the only explanations, other economies would have little to learn from successful stories of East Asia. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p9.69">So the theory or model of East Asian States can not be formed in this situation. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p9.69">But this is not the case from the experience of East Asian Development, since the role of government is also influential factor. </s>

<head rend="underlined bold">Conclusion</head>
<p n="p66.69">
<s n="s1.4;p66.69">The theories of developmental state (including embedded autonomy, and shared growth, market-friendly and flexible policy) are relevant to explain the successful stories in Hong Kong and Singapore. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p66.69">The embedded autonomy in HK and Singapore can explain that these states can prevent rent-seeking activities. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p66.69">The theories of shared growth, market-friendly and flexible policy can explain that Hong Kong government intervened in the housing and stock market under the faith in "positive non-intervention". </s>
<s n="s4.4;p66.69">And the theories of market-friendly and flexible policy can describe that Singapore government reduced the state intervention under its faith in the government involvement. </s>
</p>
<p n="p67.69">
<s n="s1.7;p67.69">But the theories still have some problem. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p67.69">Some of the components in the market friendly strategy (including ensure adequate investment in people, provision of a competitive climate for enterprise and openness of international trade and stable macroeconomic management) are too vague. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p67.69">The stable macroeconomic management is a way of the provision of a competitive for enterprise. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p67.69">In fact, the provision of a competitive climate for enterprise can be interpreted in many ways. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p67.69">Although the market friendly strategy fairly explains the HK and Singapore, it can't explain Japan which is still not openness of international trade. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p67.69">If the study is expanded into more than two countries, the theories will get the same problem with the neo-classical or statist view which can't reflect the reality. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p67.69">But, overall, the theories are relevance to Hong Kong and Singapore's situation. </s>
</p>
<p n="p68.69">
<s n="s1.8;p68.69">Different countries have different historical background. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p68.69">According to Path dependency theory, outcome of a process depends on its past history .So it is difficult to greatly change Hong Kong and Singapore in the faith in less intervention and government involvement respectively because of their historical background. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p68.69">But their economies are still successful, since the degree of intervention is not a key factor to affect the economy. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p68.69">The more important thing is how the state intervenes. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p68.69">From the Singapore experience, the government intervened in market oriented way. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p68.69">And then they adjusted and reduced the government intervention according to the situation. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p68.69">The other developing countries which wanted to follow the model of Singapore or Hong Kong should consider their background. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p68.69">When they follow a certain degree of intervention, they should be flexible to adjust it. </s>
</p>
<p n="p69.69">
<s n="s1.2;p69.69">To conclude, the successful stories in East Asia are worthy studying. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p69.69">But when other countries want to copy from them, they should consider their own situation first. </s>
