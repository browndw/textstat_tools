<p n="p24.26">
<s n="s1.8;p24.26">As referred to the extract from Codex 'General Guidelines on Sampling' cited on page 39 of the handbook 'Statistical Aspects of Q.A', the Acceptable Quality Level (AQL) for a given sampling plan is the rate of non-conforming items at which a lot will be rejected with a low probability, usually 5%. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p24.26">It is also referred to as particular producers' risk. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p24.26">Additionally, AQL can be used as an indexing criterion applied to a continuous series of lots which corresponds to a maximum rate of acceptable defective items in lots (or the maximum number of defective items per hundred items). </s>
<s n="s4.8;p24.26">The very important aspect of AQL is that it is a quality goal fixed by the profession. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p24.26">What that means is higher the rate of defective items exceeds the AQL, the greater is the probability of rejection of a lot. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p24.26">Therefore, for any given sample size, if the AQL is lowered, then the protection for the consumer against accepting lots with high defective rates becomes greater, and the requirement for the producer to conform with sufficiently high quality requirements becomes greater as well. </s>

<s n="s8.8;p24.26">If necessary, the value of AQL should take into account safety aspects. </s>
</p>
<p n="p25.26">
<s n="s1.9;p25.26">Corresponding to the ISO standards cited on page 40 of the handbook of 'Statistical Aspects of Q.A', there are mainly two categories of product characteristics which are associated in matching the AQL levels. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p25.26">The first category is the characteristics which may be linked to critical defects (e.g., to sanitary risks), and this shall be associated with a low AQL (i.e. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p25.26">0.1% to 0.65%); whereas the second category is the compositional characteristics such as fat or water content, etc, and this may be associated with a higher AQL (e.g. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p25.26">2.5% or 6.5% are the values often used for milk products). </s>
<s n="s5.9;p25.26">As a result of those, for a given product, in order to monitor both of its safety and quality aspects, a single AQL should be allocated to each of the two classes of nonconformities. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p25.26">I.E., a low AQL (e.g. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p25.26">0.65%) being allocated to class A nonconformities (e.g. pesticide content in follow-up milk), and a higher AQL (e.g. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p25.26">6.5%) being allocated to class B nonconformities (e.g. protein content in follow-up milk). </s>
<s n="s9.9;p25.26">Consequently, there is a separate sampling plan for each of the two AQLs, and a lot is accepted only if it is accepted by each of the plans. </s>
</p>
<p n="p26.26">
<s n="s1.2;p26.26">Based on the principles discussed above, referring to my sampling scheme in this exercise, as estimated in Q(c) the corresponding AQLs of the producers' risk for the 3 single sampling plans of normal inspection, tightened inspection and reduced inspection are 0.75%, 0.35% and 0.75% respectively. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p26.26">As all the AQLs are close enough to 0.65%, which are considered to be low AQL values, the sampling scheme here containing the three single sampling plans can be allocated to the particular food situations (problems), which are class A nonconformities that are characteristics of food linking to critical defects, (e.g. sanitary risks like pesticide content in follow-up milk and other safety respects of the products). </s>
