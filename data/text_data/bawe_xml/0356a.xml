<p n="p5.17">
<s n="s1.4;p5.17">Then the created project is set to default factory settings after choosing ICCM16C and X-Link in the project options. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p5.17">The program C-Spy was chosen as the debugger. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p5.17">Then in the project files the incomplete C code, .xcl file and .s34 file was selected. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p5.17">Then the incomplete C code was opened and the missing codes were entered to display a count (Modulo 100) in the LED displays ('tens' are displayed on LED 1 and 'units' are displayed on LED 2) when SW 1 was pressed. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.17">
<s n="s1.3;p6.17">The M16C development board was then connected to the power supply and the PC via the serial link. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p6.17">Then the circuit board was switched on and .s34 and .xcl files were added to the project. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p6.17">The C-Spy was run as the debugger and the program was executed in the ROM monitor mode via the M16 development board. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.17">
<s n="s1.2;p7.17">Then a count was carried out in the microcontroller (modulo 100) when SW 1 was pressed. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p7.17">This count was displayed on the LED displays. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.17">
<s n="s1.3;p8.17">Then the continuous step function was aborted and the code was modified to reduce the count when SW 2 was pressed. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p8.17">The C-Spy was then run as the debugger and program was executed in the ROM monitor mode via the M16 development board. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p8.17">Then this function was displayed on the LED displays. </s>

<p n="p9.17">
<s n="s1.1;p9.17">When the code was opened in the project window, some of the main syntax at the very beginning of the code was in a different format and had to be changed. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.17">
<s n="s1.2;p10.17">When the 'PD' terminals were defined in the main body of the program it was defined as "PD = 0x0FF", and it was supposed to be "PD0 = 0x0FF". </s>
<s n="s2.2;p10.17">Therefore this had to be changed. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.17">
<s n="s1.2;p11.17">A new 'if' function had to be added to the while loop to decrease the count when the SW 2 was pressed. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p11.17">This function was the same as the function that does the increasing count but the specific codes for the switches and a few other codes had to be changed to achieve the required action. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.17">
<s n="s1.1;p12.17">When displaying these counts on the LED displays both the displays had to be selected and deselected and count function had to be changed from '%' to '/' for the decreasing count. </s>
