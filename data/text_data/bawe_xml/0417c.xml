<quote lang="English"> "Prior to 1945, concerns to do with mercenaries were expressed largely through the development of the law of neutrality.

<s n="s1.10;p4.25">While the international community took some legal measures to prohibit the recruitment of mercenaries and to limit their activities, there was a relative indifference to the issue of mercenaries until the decolonization period of the 1960s and 1970s. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p4.25">Mercenary activity came under the radar when, "the use of mercenaries against national liberation movements fighting for independence in colonial territories was declared a criminal act by UN General Assembly Resolution 2465, thus designating mercenaries as outlaws." </s>

<s n="s5.10;p4.25">This expansion of roles was largely due to a shift in how war was fought. </s>

<s n="s7.10;p4.25">The first characteristic is that the main actors are no longer exclusively states. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p4.25">The second characteristic is that new war is about guerrilla war and counter insurgency - two types of warfare generally fought by non-mainstream arms of the military, such as Special Forces groups. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p4.25">"PSCs are frequently well placed to conduct these types of operations, since if they go wrong, governments can deny having anything to do with them, or at the very least, minimize their involvement." </s>

<s n="s1.4;p6.25">If PMCs are not firmly encapsulated within IHL and a regulatory framework, issues of accountability will arise. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p6.25">In the same way that the ICRC detention monitoring programme forces state accountability for the well-being of their prisoners, some method of achieving accountability and transparency must be in place for PMCs. </s>

<s n="s1.8;p19.25">There are two methods to assigning state responsibility. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p19.25">Firstly, states can be made responsible for PMCs that are incorporated within their borders. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p19.25">This would avoid the issue of the structural issues of IHL being unable to incorporated non-state actors into the legal system. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p19.25">However, it would only be a temporary solution, as different types of non-state actors are becoming more and more active in global conflicts. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p19.25">One problem with this method would be the likelihood that some PMCs would relocate to countries with weaker enforcement capabilities; much like some international maritime freight companies have relocated to certain developing countries to avoid environmental restrictions. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p19.25">A second method would be to create a governing body for all PMCs and to give that body legal status in the Geneva Conventions. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p19.25">No PMC would be permitted to operate without being regulated by the governing body. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p19.25">The draw-back to this method would be that it has the potential of pushing PMCs further underground, thereby reducing accountability and transparency even further. </s>

<p n="p20.25">
<s n="s1.1;p20.25">Another issue that must be reviewed follows on the proposal that states be held responsible for the actions of PMCs incorporated in their jurisdiction: should states be compelled by international humanitarian law to pass regulations governing the PMCs in their own domestic territories? </s>
</p>
<p n="p21.25">
<s n="s1.6;p21.25">Some countries have already begun designing legislation to govern PMCs in their national jurisdiction with the agenda of protecting the state's reputation and interests. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p21.25">If states were responsible for PMCs incorporated in their jurisdiction, "the lack of national legislation to control the sale of military services by PSCs could be construed as a failure by states to discharge their international obligation to preserve peace and security. </s>

<s n="s4.6;p21.25">While the passing of national legislation is not being proposed as an alternative to reviewing IHL and the status of PMCs, it is being put forward as a review that could provide complementary law to govern PMCs. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p21.25">It is interesting to note that the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act of 2000 (the US Act enacted to govern the conduct of PMCs) governs only the conduct of those PMCs working for the US government. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p21.25">It appears that the US government extended regulation only so far as protecting the government's interests. </s>
