<head rend="underlined bold">Task 3</head>
<p n="p1.15">
<s n="s1.4;p1.15">Holtzbrinck Publishers Holdings Limited has performed excellently with by far the highest turnover and the second highest profit amongst others companies in its peer group. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p1.15">Since 1999 both profit and turnover have been increasing peeking at 2003. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p1.15">However the latest year (2004) has not proved to be so successful with a slight dip in both profit and turnover. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p1.15">Growth of the company was greatest between 1999 and 2000 with an increase of turnover of approximately £60,000 </s>
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="underlined bold">Task 5</head>
<p n="p2.15">
<s n="s1.3;p2.15">Compared with its peer group, Holtzbrinck Publishers Holdings Limited is the highest performing company bar one. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p2.15">In 2004 the company had the joint highest Turnover (£589,237) and one of the top three Profits (£46,001). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p2.15">Generally, the peer group itself had wildly varying Turnover to Profit ratios ranging from 49.9 to -49.9 (to one decimal place) </s>
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="underlined bold">Task 6</head>
<p n="p3.15">
<s n="s1.5;p3.15">For each quarter worksheet (e.g. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p3.15">Qtr 1), "Total" is simply an addition of the three listed months and "Average" a mean average of the months. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p3.15">"Commission Percentage" uses the "Total" and looks up a corresponding percentage on the "Payment Scheme" Worksheet. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p3.15">Using this percentage and "Total" the commission is calculated in terms of value. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p3.15">Finally, the bonus column outputs whether or not the salesperson has exceeded or matched the Quarterly Target. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.15">
<s n="s1.5;p4.15">Each column in the Payments worksheet uses corresponding data in the quarterly sheets (i.e. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p4.15">Qtr1-4). </s>
<s n="s3.5;p4.15">Annual Total takes the Total of each quarter and adds them together. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p4.15">Monthly Average and Quarterly Average are simply the Annual Total divided by twelve and four respectively. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p4.15">Basics salary is obtained from the "Payment Scheme worksheet" </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.15">
<s n="s1.2;p5.15">"Bonuses" counts how many times a salesperson is owed a bonus and outputs the value of this bonus. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p5.15">Additionally, it also calculated whether the salesperson is owed the additional bonus of 0.2% by matching the Annual Total of each Salesperson with the Annual Total </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.15">
<s n="s1.3;p6.15">Generally, each salesperson earns between 6-7% of the total sales per annum. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p6.15">The highest earner through the year (excluding bonuses/commission) is Turner with 7.513% of the sales force earnings. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p6.15">The least effective salesperson was Liddel with 5.959% of the sales. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.15">
<s n="s1.3;p7.15">The bonus and commission system appear to be slightly unfair. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p7.15">For example, Patel has 0.008% greater sales than Tsiolkovsky in the entire year .Tsiolkovsky, however, received a much bigger bonus/commission of 9.45% compared to Patel's 7.108%. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p7.15">This shows that some salespersons could work hard in two quarters of the year and achieve large bonuses/commissions but for the remaining two quarters, perhaps ease off slightly safe in the knowledge that they have performed better than salespeople who have worked consistently throughout the year. </s>
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="underlined bold">Task 7</head>
<p n="p8.15">
<s n="s1.4;p8.15">For two of the three months Group B had the highest average Sales. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p8.15">However, their overall sales were far lower than the other two groups. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p8.15">In March, for example, Group C had over 4 times the sales of Group B. Group C was continually the highest selling group but this was simply down to sheer numbers within the group. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p8.15">Group A was steady throughout the Quarter with an increase in performance in the last month in which they also had the highest average sales of any of the groups </s>
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="underlined bold">Task 8</head>
<p n="p9.15">
<s n="s1.1;p9.15">When the Quarterly target for quarter one is set to a low value of 85% (£361.25) it costs the company £449.0845 in bonuses and commission </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.15">
<s n="s1.2;p10.15">At 100% (i.e. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p10.15">425) personnel bonuses/commission costs the company £387.4545 .Further more when the target is increased to 115% or £448.75 the costs to the company decrease to £360.2695 </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.15">
<s n="s1.1;p11.15">If the quarterly target is decreased to 85% the company pays out £63.61 more, which is equal to a 15.9% increase on top of bonus/commission costs at 100% </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.15">
<s n="s1.1;p12.15">However, if the quarterly target increases to 115% the company saves £27.185 which is a saving of approximately 7% of the cost at 100% </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.15">
<s n="s1.1;p13.15">In terms of the number of salespeople who gain bonuses the situation is as follows: </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.15">
<s n="s1.6;p14.15">At 85% the whole sales team are owed a bonus for the first quarter. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p14.15">This is of course very high practically rendering the bonus scheme (as a tool to differentiate between the quality of each salesperson) pointless. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p14.15">When the target is changed to 100% 7/15 are owed a bonus and 6/15 are not owed a bonus. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p14.15">This means only about half of the team are owed bonuses. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p14.15">This even split is perhaps a happy medium between the company having to pay money and the staff considering the bonus scheme still worthwhile. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p14.15">When the higher target of 115% is in place then only three of the team achieve the bonus (Evans, Frances and Kowolski). </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.15">
<s n="s1.1;p15.15">Currency is in Thousands of Pounds </s>
