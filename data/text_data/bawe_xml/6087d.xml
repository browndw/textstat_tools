</docTitle>
</titlePage>
</front>
<body>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">Scientists are constantly saying that levels of obesity are increasing. What is the reason for this increase? </head>
<p n="p1.8">
<s n="s1.4;p1.8">Obesity is increasing because the amount of energy individuals consume, from the food they eat, is higher than the amount they use up in the daily activities they perform. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p1.8">Body weight is maintained by a simple energy balance between the amount of energy consumed and the amount of energy expended. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p1.8">The national food survey has identified that over the last 25 years the amount of food we consume has decreased. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p1.8">This implies that the levels of obesity are increasing because the amount of physical activity performed is declining. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.8">
<s n="s1.3;p2.8">There is also inconclusive evidence to suggest that a high fat, low carbohydrate diet favours the development of obesity. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p2.8">Over the past 5 decades the proportion of energy that is derived from fat has increased, while the proportion of carbohydrates has decreased. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p2.8">Fat has a lower priority to be utilised for energy expenditure than carbohydrate and is more likely to be stored than 'burnt off.' </s>
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">Where does the UK stand in the obesity league compared with the rest of the world? </head>
<p n="p3.8">
<s n="s1.4;p3.8">On a global scale more than 1 billion people are overweight, 300 million of which are obese. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p3.8">Currently the highest levels of obesity exist in the USA where it affects 30.6% of the population. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p3.8">In comparison, 22.4% of the UK's population is reported to be obese. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p3.8">This is the third highest level in the world below the USA and Mexico, and is shortly followed by Australia. </s>
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">Is it true that obese people have a lower metabolic rate and do not actually eat more than those of normal weight? </head>
<p n="p4.8">
<s n="s1.4;p4.8">It is not true to say that obese people have a lower metabolic rate. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p4.8">In fact, because obese people have more weight to bear; their energy expenditure will be higher in carrying out the same task as a lean person. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p4.8">Resting metabolic rate is greatly determined by the amount of muscle and fat tissue. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p4.8">The higher stores of fat that obese people have will lead to a higher metabolic rate. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.8">
<s n="s1.3;p5.8">The research that was conducted into metabolic rate and possible defects in this being the cause of obesity were abandoned. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p5.8">This is because it became clear obese people frequently under report when recording their diets. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p5.8">In some cases obese people may not eat much more than those of normal weight but their extreme weight gain is a result of physical inactivity. </s>
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">Does obesity run in families? </head>
<p n="p6.8">
<s n="s1.4;p6.8">The levels of obesity have accelerated over a relatively constant gene pool which makes it apparent that an individual's genetic make-up is not enough to be the sole cause of obesity. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p6.8">There is evidence to suggest that there may be a susceptible gene which makes some individuals more prone to the risks of obesity. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p6.8">This must be combined with adverse environmental conditions, such as poor dietary habits and lack of exercise, to cause extreme weight gain. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p6.8">As eating patterns are habitual it is more likely that a child with obese parents will develop obesity. </s>
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">Physical activity is often blamed as a factor in obesity. How much activity should we be doing and does exercise help you to lose weight? </head>
<p n="p7.8">
<s n="s1.3;p7.8">It is recommended that every adult, whether overweight or not, should take part in thirty minutes of moderate intensity physical activity on at least five days per week. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p7.8">Physical activity of moderate intensity is equivalent to a brisk walk and should be enough to raise body temperature, produce a mild sweat, but still remain comfortable. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p7.8">Obese individuals will find it difficult to reach this target so it would be sufficient to begin with a shorter time period and build it up over several weeks. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.8">
<s n="s1.2;p8.8">Physical activity by itself will result in moderate weight loss. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p8.8">To achieve the greatest loss in weight it should be accompanied by diet restriction. </s>
