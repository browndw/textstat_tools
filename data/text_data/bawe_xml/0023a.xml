<p n="p2.29">
<s n="s1.1;p2.29">Although there are many more disadvantages to DC than to AC, I have decided the best choice of current would be DC because the disadvantages are less significant than those of AC. For example, even though there will be more losses through the wire with DC current as it can't be transformed to a high voltage, there will be less losses in the motor as you won't be limited to alternating the motor speed using resistors, which will carry a much higher resistance and therefore loose much more current than in any piece of wire in getting there. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.29">
<s n="s1.2;p3.29">Because DC can't be transformed, we'll have to use lower voltage all the way through. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p3.29">This means the gap between any conductor and insulated frame need not be bigger than a few millimetres, although the static and passing gaps formed by the Heath and Safety Executive enforce 75mm and 25mm gaps respectively, for a voltage up to 750v. </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="underlined">Voltage Level</head>
<p n="p4.29">
<s n="s1.2;p4.29">We need to come up with a voltage that will be suitable for traversing down a length of wire without too much power loss, and then power a DC motor of similar voltage. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p4.29">Looking at the equation </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.29">
<s n="s1.1;p5.29">
<formula notation="" id="BAWE_0023a-form.001"/> </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.29">
<s n="s1.4;p6.29">we can see that V is directly proportional to I, with the resistance in the wire, R, as a constant. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p6.29">Therefore with a large voltage as opposed to a large current, you can have a larger resistance with less loss. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p6.29">If you have a small voltage however, you will be limited to a small current if R is large to balance both sides of the equation: therefore losses are high. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p6.29">To optimise the lower losses and limit the need for higher levels of safety standard therefore, we much choose a voltage of 750v, with commercial motor characteristics determining the exact figure. </s>

<formula notation="" id="BAWE_0023a-form.002"/> </s>

<p n="p9.29">
<s n="s1.1;p9.29">where R is the overall resistance of the conductor, ρ is the resistivity of the material in Ωm, l is the length of the in meters used, and A is it's cross-sectional area in m². </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.29">
<s n="s1.7;p10.29">Say we wanted to get a R, and we already knew the length of the wire l. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p10.29">Ideally therefore, we would need to make ρ as small as possible so that we don't need as large value of A, thereby making the wire thinner. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p10.29">With thinner wire material, comes increased ductility, as the cable is not putting as much compression and tension on the inside and outside respectively, of a bend. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p10.29">We need to make a compromise therefore between cost and cross-sectional area; as generally speaking, the price of a conductor goes up with a lower resistivity. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p10.29">Plus this may not be a linear correlation. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p10.29">Some metals may have a high purity and therefore low resistivity only after taking it through an expensive refinement process several times. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p10.29">Each time the metal is refined, it may incur a half-life by which the difference in resistivity before and after refinement becomes less each time, making the cost less practical. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.29">
<s n="s1.3;p11.29">In the search for a good low-cost conductor, one could easily choose copper and be done with it. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p11.29">After all, copper is one of the cheapest metals to form because it is so malleable and, for it's electrical characteristics, is of excellent value for money. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p11.29">Copper has many alloys associated with it, the uses of which are shown below. </s>

</table>
<p n="p12.29">
<s n="s1.2;p12.29">As you can see, the only alloy commonly used as an electrical conductor is copper or pure copper. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p12.29">This is probably due to the higher cost of manufacturing the alloys, as although they might have better electrical characteristics, we could use thicker ordinary copper and still make a saving over the thinner alloys. </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.29">
<s n="s1.4;p13.29">Times change however. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p13.29">Copper is not longer as plentiful as it use to be and now the price of the raw material is steadily rising. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p13.29">Therefore, other materials such as aluminium, which is steadily being caught by copper price wise, have to be taken into consideration. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p13.29">A table of a few conductors and there association with copper is shown below. </s>

</table>
<p n="p14.29">
<s n="s1.3;p14.29">As you can see, copper still wins on conductivity, but if weight was a critical factor, aluminium would win, having 214% of the conductivity of copper per unit mass. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p14.29">The only point where steel alloy would be useful is it's high tensile strength, however this is not a deciding factor as the wire is simply traversing the frame of the pantograph, therefore it is not in any tension, so strength is largely irrelevant. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p14.29">Also, weight is not a critical factor because the material is small in quantity compared to the weight of the frame. </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.29">
<s n="s1.5;p15.29">Lets look therefore at a typical example. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p15.29">A tram may weigh 30 tonnes, that's 30 000kg, and carry 150 passengers with an average weight of 80kg (12 tonnes in total). </s>
<s n="s3.5;p15.29">The tram could have an average speed of 50km/h, or 14m/s. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p15.29">Acceleration will be no more than 1.4m/s². </s>
<s n="s5.5;p15.29">Therefore </s>

</p>
<p n="p19.29">
<s n="s1.5;p19.29">Using P = V.I , we can obtain a current value for a tolerance 748.5V voltage as being 1100A, which sounds about right for a tram of this sort. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p19.29">To completely traverse the frame of the pantograph,, we will need not more than 3m of cable. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p19.29">Because we want to keep losses to a minimum, we want no more than 0.2% voltage drop and to keep the motor within tolerances. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p19.29">Using R = V/I , this equated to a resistance of 0.013Ω. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p19.29">To test this I have used a simple circuit with a potential divider to calculate V <hi rend="sub">S</hi> again with the values I found out. </s>

<s n="s2.7;p22.29">This gives a cross-sectional area requirement of 3.7cm². </s>
<s n="s3.7;p22.29">This cross-sectional area of wire will have to be split up into several stands to make sure that minimum tension and compression is being applied to the outside and inside of the wire, which would be significant if using solid core wire. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p22.29">If the wire is constantly being bent, i.e. tensioned and compressed too much, then the metal will harden and snap. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p22.29">This is another reason for using copper, as it's ductility will delay this happening. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p22.29">Another alternative to the arrangement of strands other than a circular cross-section would be a flat wire. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p22.29">This will reduce stress in the wire more still, prolonging the life of the wire for maintenance purposes. </s>

<p n="p23.29">
<s n="s1.3;p23.29">Another reason of choosing between different materials is their resistance to corrosion. </s>

<s n="s3.5;p24.29">However, copper oxides grow if the copper is heated. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p24.29">If the copper is heated for a lengthy amount of time, then eventually the metal will harden and break. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p24.29">This is why it is especially important to make sure the copper has a good connection, therefore higher tolerances in the joining processes need to be observed. </s>

<p n="p25.29">
<s n="s1.3;p25.29">The oxidising problem in copper would be particularly prudent in pressure connections where the metal is pressed again another as opposed to forging the metals together. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p25.29">When pressure connections are used, it is imperative that the right sorts of metals are joined together; otherwise the oxides of the metals will react and create a high resistance at the joint. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p26.29">The methods for fusion joining are brazing, welding and soldering. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p26.29">Brazing would be a good choice in this application because of the lower temperature requirements and that is uses brass rod, which is a copper alloy, though a low corrosion silver solder may also be used. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p26.29">The high temperatures of 650°C - 700°C may still be enough to damage insulation and anneal the conductor though. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p26.29">A better solution would be to solder the conductors. </s>

<s n="s3.5;p28.29">Through my research, I have discovered that the most commonly used and durable insulator is silicon-based rubber, having a high resistance to weathering and high breakdown voltages. </s>

<head rend="underlined">Conclusions</head>
<p n="p29.29">
<s n="s1.9;p29.29">I have decided the pantograph should run a relatively high voltage of 750v, which is at the top of the scale of the HSE's guidelines without requiring further insulation. </s>

<s n="s3.9;p29.29">The current drawn will be DC, because the motor will be easier to control that way with fewer losses that resistors in an AC motor. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p29.29">Also DC doesn't produce inductance in the wire, though this may not be such an issue in this application, even with AC. Insulation will be limited to silicon rubber strips because of the small gaps required between live wire and earthed frame. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p29.29">The material is both safe and durable and will withstand bad weather. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p29.29">I have chosen copper as the main conductor because it is cheap at the moment and have good conductivity and ductility. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p29.29">Aluminium may be considered at a later stage if the price of copper goes up. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p29.29">Multithread, flat copper wire would be best to stop breakages and give extra flexibility. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p29.29">Clamp connectors will be used to join wires together, but conductive paste may have to be used to keep contacts clean when operating. </s>
