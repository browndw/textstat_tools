<s n="s2.7;p5.20">Such intelligent lighting systems posses the ability to deactivate or dim in response to adequate natural lighting levels, and vice versa. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p5.20">Some system activate using information provided by occupancy sensors and can be regulated according to the internal (lux) lighting levels. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p5.20">For example, suitable lux levels for the working environment are set as the standard level for a particular building. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p5.20">The lighting system will maintain this level of lighting throughout the day by adding or subtracting artificial lighting as appropriate. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p5.20">This can be achieved by dimming the lux level from 0-100% as required throughout the day. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p5.20">Many intelligent lighting systems are also occupancy-based whereby the lights switch on when a working area is occupied and off when vacant. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.20">
<s n="s1.4;p6.20">Given that artificial lighting accounts for a substantial amount of a building's energy consumption smart system are also available to exploit natural light effectively in order to reduce a building's dependence on artificial lighting to a maximum possible degree. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p6.20">The solution is the use of systems that respond to solar angles providing optimal positions for motorized devices for channeling, reflecting and shading daylight. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p6.20">Such systems are assisted by sensors which provide information relating to outside light and solar intensity and inside light levels and from such data determine the appropriate response. </s>

</p>
<p n="p8.20">
<s n="s1.3;p8.20">A smart artificial lighting system is also employed whereby workplace occupancy detectors activate electric lighting and adjust light intensity as required. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p8.20">Luminaries are centrally mounted in a ceiling panel with three double-bend compact fluorescent tubes. </s>

</p>
<p n="p10.20">
<s n="s1.5;p10.20">The Gotz building is designed to maintain an internal temperature of 20C, using passive solar energy and heat gains from secondary energy sources such as from people and equipment. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p10.20">In conditions of low temperature the double skin, which has a 600mm cavity and automatically controlled inlet and outlet flaps that are used to vary the glazings thermal performance, can be closed to allow air in the cavity to be warmed by the sun or indirectly by absorption louvers. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p10.20">The lower sets of louvers are black on one side and reflective on the other. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p10.20">These can be rotated to absorb solar radiation or reflect or reflect it as appropriate to internal conditions. </s>

</p>
<p n="p11.20">
<s n="s1.3;p11.20">As for cooling, mechanized cooling devices are employed based on established passive cooling methods such as earth exchangers, borehole water and ground water. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p11.20">Many intelligent buildings make use of computer controlled nigh time ventilation for pre-cooling of the thermal mass. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p12.20">By operating various element of the building fabric, such a retractable roof, motorized windows and pneumatic dampers, it is possible to automatically regulate the ventilation system for increased efficiency and increased occupant control. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p12.20">During poor conditions such as rain and wind these elements may also be closed automatically. </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.20">
<s n="s1.2;p13.20">Many buildings have a mixed approach to ventilation. </s>

<p n="p14.20">
<s n="s1.5;p14.20">The Gotz building is naturally ventilated through the glazed double skin. </s>

<s n="s3.4;p15.20">There are also fire detection and suppression systems for blazing and fast fires, a gas suppression system which uses environmentally safe and clean agent, biometric finger print based access control for the data center, a common monitoring system for all points of the building at various angles both inside as well as outside. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p15.20">In addition to the very early fire and smoke detection system, the building materials at the data center are able to resist for over two hours. </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.20">
<s n="s1.4;p16.20">A new concept for the intelligent building management system is the "interfacing occupancy information to building controls". </s>

<s n="s3.4;p16.20">If there is a fire in the building the process of the fire controlling mechanism is able to operate without damaging the infrastructure and data: For example, in the event of a fire, the fire alarm communicates with the security system to unlock the doors. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p16.20">The fire alarm system would also interact with the HVAC system to regulate the flow of air so as to prevent the spread of fire. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p19.20">The concept of the "intelligent façade" proposes a more dynamic building shell. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p19.20">This is analogous to the human skin; which is waterproof, vapor-transmitting, self-repairing, sensitive membrane containing signal transmitting nerve endings and heating and cooling systems all within just a few millimeters of its surface. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p19.20">Similar to the human skin, the intelligent skin is sensitive and responsive to the external environment. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p19.20">The main feature of the intelligent skin is the ability to actively and automatically adjust the flow of energy through the building envelope by regulating and manipulating external elements as required. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p19.20">This would be achieved with the use of intelligent control systems, using only renewable resources and secondary heat gains to power a buildings comfort system. </s>

</p>
<p n="p20.20">
<s n="s1.4;p20.20">When observing the history of the evolution of buildings and extrapolating to the future according to certain patterns it is tempting to think that buildings are becoming more "biological" systems. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p20.20">The industrial revolution of 300 years ago provided technology that revolutionized buildings at their time. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p20.20">Subsequently, the information revolution that sparked some fifty years had also transformed the way buildings would function by providing computer and telecommunication technology allowing the development of systems that can measure, evaluate, and respond to change. </s>
