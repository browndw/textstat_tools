<list type="simple">
<head rend="bold">Table 1 - Types of Parasites</head>
<item>Facultative Parasite: A parasite that is able to adapt to a changing habitat. It can be free-living, however, if conditions become unfavourable it can prey on host organisms to obtain nutrients. </item>
<item>Obligate Parasite: A parasite that is unable to develop and grow autonomously, therefore relying on a host for survival.</item>

<p n="p3.28">
<s n="s1.2;p3.28">Parasitic plants either live in or on their hosts, penetrating through their roots or stems. </s>

</p>
<list type="simple">
<head rend="bold">Table 2 - Types of Parasitic Plants</head>
<item>Hemiparasite/ Semi-parasite: A parasite that relies on its host for half of its nutriment, but still able to photosynthesise, due to the production of chlorophyll. An example is the Eurasian mistletoe (<hi rend="italic">Viscum album</hi>). </item>
<item>Holoparasite: A parasite that relies completely on its host in order to obtain nutriments. This parasite is unable to photosynthesise for itself and therefore lacks chlorophyll, for example <hi rend="italic">Cuscata epilinum</hi> from the dodder family. Approximately twenty percent of all species are holoparasitic [Press, Graves, 1995]. </item>

<head rend="bold">Host Plants </head>
<p n="p4.28">
<s n="s1.4;p4.28">The majority of vascular plants, approximately eighty five percent [Hickman, Johnson, 2004], have mutalistic relationships with fungi, aiding with the absorption of nutrients from the soil. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p4.28">The relationship between plant roots and fungal hyphae is called mycorrhizae of which there are two main types: endomycorrhizae and ectomycorrhizae. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p4.28">Endomycorrhizae (Diagram 1) are the most common, however ectomycorrhizae (Diagram 2) are most common in temperate and boreal forest trees [Hickmanal. 2004]. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p4.28">The mycorrhizae create a larger surface area over which nutrients can be absorbed. </s>

<p n="p5.28">
<s n="s1.3;p5.28">Root parasites take advantage of the mycorrhizae and insert their haustorium in order to absorb the nutrients. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p5.28">An example is the holoparasitic Indian pipe (<hi rend="italic">Monotropa uniflora</hi>), a relative of heathers and rhododendrons, and found in coniferous forests (Photograph 7). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p5.28">It absorbs nutriments from the mycorrhizae of coniferous trees, and grows to approximately ten inches above the leaf litter [Attenborough, 1995]. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.28">
<s n="s1.3;p6.28">Parasites rarely cause the death of their hosts, since the host is required for the very basis of survival, especially non-photosynthetic holoparasites that cannot generate energy and nutrients without chlorophyll. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p6.28">Therefore holoparasites generally have an immense range of hosts. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p6.28">Parasitic plants can, however, cause the host growth loss, but it may not be obvious until the parasite has infected a considerable amount of the host. </s>

<head rend="bold">Haustorium</head>
<p n="p7.28">
<s n="s1.8;p7.28">The haustorium is a chemotropic adaptation of the root system designed for parasitic plants to create a conduit, in order to transport water, carbohydrates and nutriments from their host. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p7.28">The developing roots (radicle) of non-parasitic plants generally grow in a downward direction due to gravitational forces and away from light. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p7.28">However the <hi rend="italic">Viscum album</hi> radicle, for example, grows in the direction of the host, whether it is towards light or opposing gravity. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p7.28">Once the radicle has reached the host plant it then transforms into a haustorium and perforates into the host's tissue, until it reaches the cambium. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p7.28">The circumference then increases and cortical strands grow from the haustorium, parallel to the cambium. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p7.28">Sinkers then form on the cortical strands as they touch the cambium, penetrating the xylem (Diagram 3). </s>
<s n="s7.8;p7.28">The remaining cortical strands penetrate the phloem, allowing for a conduit through which nutriments and water travel from the host's vascular system to the parasite [Worral, 2005]. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p7.28">The haustorium gene is believed to have originated from either autotrophic, non-parasitic plants or from endophytic organisms, such as, bacteria/fungi [Penn State University, 2006]. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p8.28">Hemiparasites usually only penetrate the xylem to obtain water from the host, and photosynthesise to obtain nutrients for themselves. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p8.28">A method in which various mistletoes' are able to extract water from their host is to allow for continual transpiration to occur throughout the day. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p8.28">This process would normally, in non-parasitic plants, result in a considerable amount of water loss and as a result a wilting plant. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p8.28">However, by maintaining open stomata the mistletoe establishes a "steep water potential gradient" [Mathias, 1995], withdrawing a significant amount of water and nitrogen from the host. </s>

<s n="s2.2;p9.28">It also provides a structural support for the parasite given that it is the site of attachment to the host by means of hapteron, which "secrete a polysaccharide adhesive" [Mathias, 1995]. </s>

<s n="s2.6;p10.28">There are two mistletoe families, Viscaceae and Loranthaceae, which originally belonged to the same family Loranthaceae [Kuijt, 1969]. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p10.28">This division occurred due to the conspicuous differences between the two; the Viscaceae family all have relatively small, inconspicuous flowers, with red/white berries and are usually found in temperature regions of the Northern Hemisphere. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p10.28">The Loranthaceae family have much more ostentatious flowers and are found in tropical regions, for example, <hi rend="italic">Nuytsia floribunda</hi>, the 'Christmas tree' found in Australia which blooms in December/January. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p10.28">
<hi rend="italic">Nuytsia floribunda</hi> is found in Australian heathlands, and can reach a height of up to forty five feet tall. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p10.28">Its roots produce white suckers that encircle and cut into a host's roots, the haustorium then diverts water and nutrients (Attenborough, 1995). </s>
