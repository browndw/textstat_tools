<s n="s1.11;p1.46">This literature review will examine the different approaches used to tackle truancy within schools. </s>
<s n="s2.11;p1.46">It will in look in detail at the methodology used to research the effectiveness of such interventions. </s>
<s n="s3.11;p1.46">My second year placement has just been completed with the Education Social Work Service in Oxfordshire and this has given me an insight into the issues surrounding truancy and how they are being addressed. </s>
<s n="s4.11;p1.46">In the past few years there has been a high-profile publicity campaign and various approaches have been used to tackle truancy. </s>
<s n="s5.11;p1.46">However, history shows that with all the work being done the scale of school absenteeism has hardly changed. </s>
<s n="s6.11;p1.46">For example, in 1870 before compulsory education was introduced the school board in Leeds achieved attendance rates of 89% among children on the school roll. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p1.46">In comparison the attendance returns made in June 2001 indicated the attendance rates among Leeds secondary school was also 89% (Zhang 2004). </s>
<s n="s8.11;p1.46">In addition the unauthorised absence rates in the past ten years has remained stable at around 1% for secondary schools and 0.5% for primary schools. </s>
<s n="s9.11;p1.46">The latest campaign introduced by the government is a system of Fast-Track prosecution of parents. </s>
<s n="s10.11;p1.46">The education minister, Ivan Lewis said in 2003 "the message is clear - prosecution works" (Zhang 2004). </s>
<s n="s11.11;p1.46">However, this is not based on thorough academic enquiry, in fact, my literature search on this subject shows that very little research to prove this statement has been carried out. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.46">
<s n="s1.8;p2.46">There are further debates, which show the effectiveness of placing an Education Social Worker within the school. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p2.46">This tackles truancy by being readily accessible to pupils and parents and to be able to investigate the reasons behind truancy. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p2.46">This enables the ESW to work in partnership with other agencies to put supportive measures in place before the situation reaches crisis. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p2.46">In my experience on placement it was apparent that truancy cannot be addressed without investigating the wider family circumstances. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p2.46">It seemed that the Education Service and Social and Health Care were working in isolation and it was very difficult to enlist the help of Social and Health Care even when the family appeared to have reached crisis point. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p2.46">When looking at research it can be seen that truancy is a serious indicator of physio-socio education disturbance (Pritchard and Williams 2001). </s>
<s n="s7.8;p2.46">It can not effectively be addressed by using just one method of intervention such as the prosecution of parents. </s>

<s n="s1.12;p12.46">This project was a school-based child and family social work service set up in four schools in Dorset (two primary and two secondary). </s>

<s n="s3.8;p18.46">Furthermore the evaluation could not be 'blind' as many teachers in the project school had partners in the comparative schools. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p42.46">It can also be seen that the process of prosecution had both positive and negative effects on parents. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p42.46">It helped parents to reinforce their authority in the home, however, this was largely as a result of advice on parenting skills and disciplining strategies offered by the ESWs. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p42.46">There was also a detrimental effect on family relationships and the relationship between the ESW and the families. </s>

<p n="p43.46">
<s n="s1.1;p43.46">Data was collected from 30 children whose parents had been prosecuted. </s>
</p>
<p n="p44.46">
<s n="s1.2;p44.46">Thirteen were classed as effective as the post prosecution attendance levels had risen. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p44.46">Eleven were not effective and six cases had mixed effectiveness - there had been some increase but this was followed by a decline. </s>
</p>
<p n="p45.46">
<s n="s1.4;p45.46">Results also show the effectiveness is dependent on the age of the child when the prosecution took place. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p45.46">The ESW's felt it was more effective when dealing with younger children as later prosecutions meant that the child's behaviour had become entrenched. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p45.46">This is in contrast to the previous piece of research (Zhang 2004) in which he states there are some positive response to parental prosecution of secondary school pupils. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p45.46">Although these two pieces of research have different views on the effectiveness of prosecution it has highlighted the possible link between the effectiveness and age of the pupil. </s>

<head rend="underlined bold">Conclusion</head>
<p n="p46.46">
<s n="s1.6;p46.46">There is no doubt that many different approaches have been used to tackle truancy with the most recent being parental prosecution. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p46.46">However, the evidence from this does not show a positive relationship between prosecution and the reduction of truancy. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p46.46">Earlier research has shown the effectiveness of placing a qualified social worker within the school who can work in partnership with parents, pupils and other outside agencies. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p46.46">However, from both viewpoints there is no doubt that early intervention is essential. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p46.46">There is very little research into the effectiveness of parental prosecution but one factor that was highlighted in both pieces of research was the difference between primary and secondary school pupils. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p46.46">It is clear therefore that further research is needed to find out whether the attendance legislation needs to be amended to take into account the child's age. </s>
