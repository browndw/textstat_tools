<p n="p1.16">
<s n="s1.5;p1.16">In 1922 Bertrand Russell presciently recognised China's growing importance, that the whole world "will be vitally affected by the development of Chinese affairs, which may well prove a decisive factor, for good or evil, during the next two centuries". </s>
<s n="s2.5;p1.16">Russell, recognising China's essential differences to the West, asks whether China can retain its 'virtues' without being forced to adopt the 'model' of "all the foreign nations with which she has dealings",<ref target="BAWE_0292f-ftnote.001"/> a question that is just as relevant today. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p1.16">In the last decade, economic importance on the world stage has increased dramatically, to an extent at which even Russell might be surprised. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p1.16">Economic reforms have been implemented rapidly since Deng Xiaoping's exhortation to the people that "to get rich is glorious" leading to its powerful current position, where it stands to overtake the US as the world's largest economy by 2020<ref target="BAWE_0292f-ftnote.002"/>. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p1.16">The extent of China's influence is easy to see, with their fuel needs pushing up oil prices<ref target="BAWE_0292f-ftnote.003"/>, their cheap goods fuelling consumption<ref target="BAWE_0292f-ftnote.004"/> and their huge markets for an ever increasing number of goods fuelling demand for foreign manufacturers,<ref target="BAWE_0292f-ftnote.005"/> the Chinese economy is playing an increasingly large role on the world stage, a fact that has not escaped the notice of the world leaders, with Tony Blair "painfully aware that China has been growing three times as fast as the UK".<ref target="BAWE_0292f-ftnote.006"/> </s>

<s n="s1.4;p2.16">Politically, it is a different story. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p2.16">There is some evidence of a more open and pragmatic approach to foreign diplomacy, with, for example, representatives of the Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang recently meeting for a Cross-Straits Economic and Trade Forum, which included a meeting between Honorary Chairman Lien Chan and President Hu Jintao<ref target="BAWE_0292f-ftnote.007"/> and also Mr Hu's forthcoming visit to the US which will include an unprecedented three public speeches but this has been juxtaposed with comments during President Bush's recent visit that China would not tolerate "so-called Taiwanese independence". </s>
<s n="s3.4;p2.16">Domestically, the leadership has maintained a fairly steady grip on political freedoms ever since the death of Mao thirty years ago with only two real attempts at significant reform, the first being Deng Xiaoping's establishment of an institutional system in 1980 followed by Zhao Ziyang's failed attempt in 1987 to create more of a division between government and the party<ref target="BAWE_0292f-ftnote.008"/>. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p2.16">More recently, though there have been gains democratically, with increased influence and decentralisation of the NPC, the top legislature<ref target="BAWE_0292f-ftnote.009"/>, coupled with reformist rhetoric about Hu's vision for harmonious society (hexie shehui), there has nevertheless been practical evidence of a desire to maintain the leadership's grip, diminishing hopes that the current President would do for political reform what Deng Xiaoping did for the economy<ref target="BAWE_0292f-ftnote.010"/>. </s>

<p n="p3.16">
<s n="s1.9;p3.16">This essay will look at how the pressure to reform economically developed from the neo-liberal revolution in the last two decades of the 20 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> century into concrete policy under the banner of the 'Washington Consensus', but how these shock tactics that focused too heavily on macroeconomic figures and not enough on social concerns were hugely damaging to countries that adopted them. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p3.16">China's gradualist approach to economic reform, characterised by the phrase "To cross the river by groping the stone under foot" essentially recognised that unless societal change is addressed, long term stability will be impossible. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p3.16">This new "Beijing Consensus" is being seen by developing countries as a real alternative to the Western free market democratic model.<ref target="BAWE_0292f-ftnote.011"/> Recent empirical study has demonstrated that the reality of socioeconomic reform goes beyond a simple causal relationship; there is not only feedback between the two factors but also variations in their respective level of influence leading to a large number of possibilities.<ref target="BAWE_0292f-ftnote.012"/> In China especially, where the ideology of the ruling party is so inextricably tied to economic principles, the two are hard to separate. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p3.16">As a planned economy, there were inevitable problems of lack of both information and incentive and it is important to examine how China has coped with these. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p3.16">This essay will demonstrate that poor implementation of either political or economic reform, often in recent years the result of external pressure, can have disastrous results.<ref target="BAWE_0292f-ftnote.013"/> The success or failure of the economic reform has a major bearing on what political changes will result and this is why an examination of the economic liberalisation process is so important, as up until now China's decisions have managed to maintain a balance, with the success of the economy continuing to be sufficient justification for the maintenance of the stability of the political status quo. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p3.16">However, growing unrest over corruption and social inequality is leading to mounting pressure for political reform. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p3.16">To accompany these popular pressures, I will attempt to show that in order to maintain the economic growth more liberal policies have brought, China will need to make political changes or face stagnation that will be certain to lead to massive unrest, removing the Communist Party's best legitimisation of its power, namely the booming economy. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p3.16">While the first stage of China's growth, which has resulted from massive capital expansion and use of labour surplus, has been possible, perhaps even more well suited, to an authoritarian climate; in order to progress towards a 'knowledge economy' that climate must relax, before the 'graying' of China's population takes place. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p3.16">The direction China's leadership takes over the next few years is of ever increasing importance to the international community, and now, under the media spotlight as both the 17 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> quinquennial Party Congress and the Olympic Games approach, this nascent superpower finds itself faced by many more than just "two paths" of Chairman Mao. </s>

<head>WHY LIBERALISE ECONOMICALLY?</head>
<p n="p4.16">
<s n="s1.22;p4.16">Worries about Eastern dominance are nothing new. </s>
<s n="s2.22;p4.16">From the late 1950's onwards many were in awe of the Communist miracle taking place in Russia. </s>
<s n="s3.22;p4.16">There was a belief that there was a trade off between democracy and economic growth with economist Calvin Hoover suggesting in 1957 that the "collectivist authoritarian state" in the Soviet Union, could overtake the United States in the next two decades<ref target="BAWE_0292f-ftnote.014"/>. </s>
<s n="s4.22;p4.16">However in hindsight, two well publicised problems of the planned economy are a lack of information and incentives. </s>
<s n="s5.22;p4.16">While these did not prevent the rapid initial growth of Communist countries within the success of the centralised Marxist Leninist system are the seeds for its own destruction, for while planning can work well in small number of sectors producing a limited number of commodities, as consumers grow richer they begin to demand a wider variety of goods. </s>
<s n="s6.22;p4.16">This is especially problematic in agriculture, as the necessity to farm according to local conditions clashes with government quotas even when only producing grain. </s>
<s n="s7.22;p4.16">In China, collectives run by ardent supporters of the Party, rather than those with the local agricultural knowledge, led to poor land management<ref target="BAWE_0292f-ftnote.015"/>. </s>
<s n="s8.22;p4.16">When the requirements become more varied the problems are greatly exacerbated. </s>
<s n="s9.22;p4.16">The desire for more variation in consumer goods will lead also to the desire for increasingly specialised industries which tend towards lower margins, resulting in a need for closer attention to costs. </s>
<s n="s10.22;p4.16">The need for these new industries is either not recognised or is economically unviable, leading to discontent<ref target="BAWE_0292f-ftnote.016"/>. </s>
<s n="s11.22;p4.16">The Communist States became more and more aware of these problems as the Cold War drew on and it was soon obvious on both the inside and the outside that their miracle was at an end. </s>
<s n="s12.22;p4.16">The consolidation of US supremacy thus led to the assumption of superiority of the free-market democracy during the Thatcher and Reagan era, and the beginning of its adoption across the world. </s>
<s n="s13.22;p4.16">Globalisation, as this process is known, has resulted from developments in capital, technology and information, all of which having becoming increasingly integrated across national boundaries. </s>
<s n="s14.22;p4.16">Thomas Friedman has called this "new world system", which has replaced the Cold War one, a shrinking of the world from a "medium to a small"<ref target="BAWE_0292f-ftnote.017"/>. </s>
<s n="s15.22;p4.16">The fact that the metaphorical and physical boundaries of the Cold War fell, while technology advanced rapidly, has allowed a previously unprecedented freedom of economic interaction. </s>
<s n="s16.22;p4.16">These freedoms can be used to the advantage of both buyers and sellers in the global market, to the extent that those ignoring them face falling far behind. </s>
<s n="s17.22;p4.16">Companies can benefit from freer flows of capital, allowing them to shift production wherever labour costs take them and countries can benefit from this investment. </s>
<s n="s18.22;p4.16">Consumers can source their goods from a much wider range, ensuring the required quality and price. </s>
<s n="s19.22;p4.16">Free trade allows increased specialisation and thus increased efficiency. </s>
<s n="s20.22;p4.16">In theory, it is a very rosy picture and in practice there have been spectacular gains for the global economy, yet economic liberalisation remains an incredibly thorny issue. </s>
<s n="s21.22;p4.16">Dividing the discussion into those who support and oppose is somewhat redundant, as it is naive to believe that the process can be reversed; but where governments and organisations exert control it could be managed differently. </s>
<s n="s22.22;p4.16">A number of countries have suffered crises or poor performance after adoption of these reforms, which those who are positive about the current situation, like Friedman, say is an inevitable part of the system, while those who believe there is room for improvement, like David Korten and Joseph Stiglitz, argue that these problems not necessary to the extent that they have been suffered to date, of prime importance being that countries accept reform on their own terms. </s>

<s n="s2.9;p5.16">Examination of the external pressure to reform economically is of more importance in this case because it is China's resistance to this pressure, something it was capable of through the maintenance of its authoritarian government that many believe has allowed it to perform as well relative to other countries in similar positions. </s>

<s n="s1.11;p8.16">While one Soviet economist blamed the fact that while the Chinese worked hard, the Russians talked hard, a distinction more oft cited is in the direction in which the reforms were implemented. </s>
<s n="s2.11;p8.16">Deng Xiaoping provided a rhetorical and fiscal environment amiable to reform, encouraging practical debate and reducing taxes on local government, but the policies themselves were mostly enacted incrementally, initiated on a local level and then adopted more widely afterwards<ref target="BAWE_0292f-ftnote.037"/>, as opposed to the reforms of <hi rend="italic">perestroika</hi>, which came directly from President Mikhail Gorbachev. </s>
<s n="s3.11;p8.16">This difference in the reform process has been attributed to unwillingness on the part of the Soviet ruling class to yield the reins of economic control, wishing to preserve a state capitalist system and also to a desire to reform at a more rapid pace, but Deng's, even in 1962, essential realisation was that "relations of production" to be introduced must be those that "the masses... see fit"<ref target="BAWE_0292f-ftnote.038"/>. </s>
<s n="s4.11;p8.16">Deng was influenced at that time by the economist, Sun Yefang, who in turn had been inspired by the Soviet Yevesi Liberman, who advocated local autonomy of enterprise while maintaining obligations to the state, ideas that Mao rejected as the "capitalist road"<ref target="BAWE_0292f-ftnote.039"/>, but that Deng was keen to revive after his accession to power. </s>
<s n="s5.11;p8.16">As a result partly of the differing levels of development in the two countries, the Russians focused their economic reform on the heavy industry sector, an area with more prestige attached in their competition with the United States, while China began the process in agriculture, with Deng believing this would be the most effective method to stimulate the growth of "productive forces". </s>
<s n="s6.11;p8.16">The first reform was the introduction of the Contract Responsibility System, which allowed farmers to receive incentive payments for carrying out production contracts, usually given to family groups, first on a yearly then a longer term basis, though the land remained publicly owned.<ref target="BAWE_0292f-ftnote.040"/> This has had implications in today's society, as one of the causes of tension between the government and rural regions, as Beijing consequently retains considerable power over the agricultural communities. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p8.16">Small scale family farming rather than the huge collectives introduced under Mao meant there was a return to the good land management using specific local knowledge. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p8.16">Though grain remained under central control which enabled for the state provision of food known as the Iron Rice Bowl, farmers were gradually allowed to sell other goods outside of their production quotas on the free market. </s>
<s n="s9.11;p8.16">When this proved to be successful it was introduced across the country, a move which quickly boosted the income of rural areas.<ref target="BAWE_0292f-ftnote.041"/>. </s>
<s n="s10.11;p8.16">While farming moved more towards family management through the contract system, the town and village enterprises maintained the essence of the commune system, despite their nominal abolition in 1982. </s>

<s n="s3.11;p9.16">One of few significant reforms in agriculture was the abolishment of the policy of livestock slaughter to preserve grain, leading to the Soviet Union becoming a net importer of grain from the 1970's onwards, importing 42 million tons of grain annually during the Eleventh Five Year Plan that began in 1981<ref target="BAWE_0292f-ftnote.044"/>. </s>
<s n="s4.11;p9.16">This was at the expense of oil export revenues, money that was being wasted on an inefficient agricultural system. </s>
<s n="s5.11;p9.16">While incentives were introduced the attempt to reform from the top down ignored the basic lack of information about the needs of the economy, and these poorly conceived incentives, instead of stimulating growth in newly privatized enterprises led to widespread asset stripping with revenues then invested abroad, because capital markets had not yet been developed at home<ref target="BAWE_0292f-ftnote.045"/>. </s>
<s n="s6.11;p9.16">This could not be controlled because there had been no time to develop the legal and financial regulatory systems to stop it, a result of the speed of the reform which the IMF imposed. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p9.16">The Chinese changes to the State sector consisted only of privatisation in a small number of poorly performing enterprises and was founded on reform instead. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p9.16">Much like the communes were changed to become the TVEs, State industries were subject to Liberman style reforms, being run on a quota system, and following a statement of intent by Zhao Ziyang in 1984, more reform followed. </s>
<s n="s9.11;p9.16">Again, it was an appreciation of social consequences that led to this more gradual process, without resorting to privatisation, as there were fears this could lead to unemployment, one of the major problems that transition economies face<ref target="BAWE_0292f-ftnote.046"/>. </s>
<s n="s10.11;p9.16">In light of this, there was also a large and extensive welfare system in place for State enterprise employees, another move that helped to prevent widespread discontent. </s>
<s n="s11.11;p9.16">While the reform of the State sector is not regarded as successful as that of agriculture and the TVEs, the avoidance of sweeping and risky privatisations, made possible by intersectoral support, meant far fewer problems during the earlier transition stage. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p10.16">Thus, it was Deng's pragmatic and incremental approach, enacted on economy that had not been subject to an extended period of brutal economic planning that allowed China to develop its rural economy, improving the lives, but more importantly for Deng the purchasing power of more than three quarters of the population, meaning that reform in other areas was enacted in an atmosphere of growth rather than stagnation. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p10.16">That Deng had no real overarching master plan for the economy is indicated in his statement in 1987 that the township and village enterprises that aided growth were "appearing out of nowhere"<ref target="BAWE_0292f-ftnote.047"/> and his description of the reform, borrowed again from Mao, of "crossing the river by groping for the stones under foot". </s>
<s n="s3.6;p10.16">This trial and error approach, allied with a desire for stability that pragmatically acknowledges the needs of the people has thus proved more successful than the one size fits all numbers game advocated by the Western dominated international financial community. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p10.16">This is illustrated beautifully by the remarks of Poland's former deputy premier and finance minister Grzegorz Kolodoko, who attributes his countries position as the most successful of the East European former Communist States to their explicit rejection of the "Washington Consensus" and writing of how they wanted "Polish citizens to go along with these reforms" and "respected their own society"<ref target="BAWE_0292f-ftnote.048"/>. </s>

<p n="p16.16">
<s n="s1.12;p16.16">The current political situation in China is thus no longer conducive to the form of economic development that they must now pursue. </s>
<s n="s2.12;p16.16">The maintenance of an authoritarian regime that has helped shepherd the Chinese economy through the transition period has been essential, a fact shown by comparisons with countries that have faced similar problems. </s>
<s n="s3.12;p16.16">In the study cited at the beginning of the essay<ref target="BAWE_0292f-ftnote.077"/> the empirical evidence suggested that the chain of causality runs counter to the understanding of the title, but more significantly for the case of China, countries which institute economic before political reforms outperform those which operate in the opposing sequence.<ref target="BAWE_0292f-ftnote.078"/> The problem for those initially reforming politically is that the institutions needed for financial and judicial regulation are often ineffective, but their role can be filled by an authoritarian government in states like China. </s>
<s n="s4.12;p16.16">Economic policy must be well implemented, as stability has been the key avoidance of unrest. </s>
<s n="s5.12;p16.16">However, in many of the examples, states were often making capital gains, rather than the improvements in efficiency referred to by Krugman and if economic growth is to continue, stability maintained and unrest averted, changes will have to be made. </s>
<s n="s6.12;p16.16">As I have shown, in order to become a 'knowledge' economy China must liberalise the distribution of information, as the economic development required will not take place in a society that preaches isolation. </s>
<s n="s7.12;p16.16">The principles at the heart of higher education will need revaluation to create a workforce that innovates rather than imitates<ref target="BAWE_0292f-ftnote.079"/>. </s>
<s n="s8.12;p16.16">There needs to be a loosening of the Party's grip upon the business sector to allow enough transparency to halt the spread of corruption. </s>
<s n="s9.12;p16.16">If these changes are not made it will threaten the economic growth and stability of China, which in turn will lead to an intensification of unrest. </s>
<s n="s10.12;p16.16">If these changes are made, the Party's grip may have been loosened to such an extent that the repression of opposition movements will become impossible. </s>
<s n="s11.12;p16.16">So, while the understanding of the title has not only been disproved by China, it has also been shown to be a pernicious influence when the principles it implies are forced upon transition economies. </s>
<s n="s12.12;p16.16">The Communist Party has relinquished economic control to a certain extent in order to let China grow, but to continue not only this growth but improvement, further sacrifices are required, and the world waits to see if the Chinese leaders are bold enough to make them. </s>
