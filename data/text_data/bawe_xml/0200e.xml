</p>
<p n="p7.52">
<s n="s1.2;p7.52">The use of a 20% discount rate is well above the cost of capital (10%), which means that unforeseen cash outflows and other risks have been generously accounted for. </s>

</p>
<p n="p8.52">
<s n="s1.3;p8.52">Compotech operates in a rapidly changing environment so estimating demand, costs and prices in ten years time is a far more inaccurate task than making estimations within a five-year time horizon (see p.5 limitation b). </s>
<s n="s2.3;p8.52">Therefore, the net cash flows and NPVs calculated with a five-year lifespan are more accurate, but ignore the fact that the lifespan of all three investments is likely to be more than five years. </s>

<s n="s2.3;p10.52">Conversely, within ten years, equipment may need to be replaced or technological advancement may outdate the Flexi-Connector, so an investment in R&amp;D will be required to modify the product. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p10.52">Such potential costs and their associated probability of occurrence need to be accounted for because these costs will have different implications for each investment. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.52">
<s n="s1.3;p11.52">Since Ireland has the largest capacity and therefore can potentially make the highest revenue as demand grows, the improvement in this investment's NPV is the greatest relative to the other alternatives. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p47.52">If Compotech are looking for a long term, high risk and potentially high return investment then Ireland is the one to chose because its NPV over ten years is the highest (providing the cost if capital is 10% or less). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p47.52">However, I recommend eliminating this investment on the assumption that shareholders will demand an investment with a faster return and in such a rapidly changing market, it is hard to predict future variables. </s>

<p n="p48.52">
<s n="s1.4;p48.52">Ireland's long term success is highly dependent on demand maintaining its 10% annual growth rate for ten consecutive years. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p48.52">For example, if the demand growth rate falls to 5% per annum after 1998, the NPV will fall to $ 37,702,731 <ref target="BAWE_0200e-ftnote.008"/> and the plant won't reach its optimal capacity within ten years. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p48.52">This will incur inefficiency costs and make the other investments more attractive. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p48.52">Even under the 10% growth rate, the optimal capacity will not be met for seven years even, which results in wasted capacity so fixed costs are being spread thickly over few units. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p50.52">It is important to consider the other potential uses of Waltham's capacity. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p50.52">If this spare capacity will be wasted or redundant then I would definitely recommend investing in Waltham so as not to forgo this opportunity cost and because the NPVs reflect that this is a low risk investment with good short and long term returns. </s>

<p n="p51.52">
<s n="s1.5;p51.52">Waltham's maximum capacity will also be met within roughly four years, so fixed costs can be quickly spread across many units to reduce total unit cost. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p51.52">However, this does not satisfy long-term demand growth, which forgoes future revenue opportunities. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p51.52">Therefore, if demand continues to grow, invest in the Santa Clara plant 1996 so it will be ready to produce in 1998 (i.e. the year that Waltham meets its maximum capacity). </s>
