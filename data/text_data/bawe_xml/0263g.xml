<head>Summary</head>
<p n="p1.36">
<s n="s1.3;p1.36">This report details the specification, design, implementation and testing of software written to control a buggy and allow it to follow an optically marked track. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p1.36">The software was written in the C programming language and three variants were produced: one to allow the buggy to follow a square track - alternately clockwise and anticlockwise - one to allow it to follow a maze track and one to allow it to follow any other suitably marked track. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p1.36">The system performed excellently in all cases, following the track accurately and searching efficiently when the track was lost. </s>

<head rend="bold">General Specification:</head>
<p n="p2.36">
<s rend="italic" n="s1.1;p2.36"> The objective is to write software that controls a mobile buggy robot, enabling it to follow an optically marked track. </s>

<div2>
<head rend="bold">Interpretation of the Specification:</head>
<p n="p3.36">
<s n="s1.3;p3.36">Based on the above and our knowledge of the buggy, it is possible to expand a little on how the software should be implemented. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p3.36">For example, if the track is lost at any point, the buggy should 'scan' to find the track again. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p3.36">Also, if the track is not found during this scan, the buggy should move forwards and scan again until the track is found. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.36">
<s n="s1.3;p4.36">After accomplishing the task of writing software to fit the above specification, two further adaptations of the specification were produced to give a total of three slightly different specifications, each applicable to a different type of board. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p4.36">The above specification produced a piece of software which allows the buggy to run on any board marked out in a suitable width of black tape on a white background with gaps at junctions. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p4.36">A further specification allows the buggy to run on a square board and another allows it to run on a maze board, as described below. </s>

<head rend="bold">Square Specification:</head>
<p n="p5.36">
<s rend="italic" n="s1.2;p5.36"> The objective is to write software that controls a mobile buggy robot, enabling it to follow an optically marked track in the shape of a square with gaps at the corners. </s>
<s rend="italic" n="s2.2;p5.36">After completing a circuit of the board, the robot should turn round and follow the track in the opposite direction. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.36">
<s n="s1.4;p6.36">As before, if the track is lost, the buggy should scan to find the track again. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p6.36">If the track is not found during this scan (i.e. the buggy is at a corner) a 'corner counter' should be incremented and the buggy should move forwards and scan again to find the track. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p6.36">Note that the distance the buggy moves will be dictated by the size of the gaps in the board. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p6.36">If the corner counter is divisible by 4 (i.e. the buggy has passed a multiple of 4 corners and has therefore just completed a circuit), the buggy should rotate round through about 180° until it finds the track again and should continue following the track in the opposite direction (i.e. if it was traveling clockwise, it should turn and follow the track anticlockwise). </s>

</p>
<p n="p8.36">
<s n="s1.4;p8.36">Again, if the track is lost, the buggy should scan to find the track. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p8.36">If the track is not found during this scan (i.e. the buggy is at a junction or dead end), it must use a 'left wall following' algorithm. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p8.36">It must first check to see if there is a track at 90° to its left; if not then it checks 90° to the right of this, then 90° to the right of this and finally 90° to the right of this, returning it to the original track and sending it back in the direction it came from (i.e. having reached a dead end, the buggy backtracks). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p8.36">Using this algorithm allows it to solve a maze providing there are no loops within the maze. </s>

<head rend="bold">General Board Software:</head>
<p n="p9.36">
<s n="s1.3;p9.36">In order to design the required software, the requirements were analysed and then broken down into progressively smaller modules which could then be designed and implemented. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p9.36">Each board was designed then implemented before moving on to the design for the next board. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p9.36">This allowed techniques learnt during the implementation of one board to be applied to the design of the software for the next type of board. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.36">
<s n="s1.6;p10.36">For the general specification, two basic functions were required: movement and detection. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p10.36">Movement covers motion in all required directions (i.e. forwards, left, right and backwards). </s>
<s n="s3.6;p10.36">A combination of movements was required to follow the track, scan for the track when lost and react to the result of a scan. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p10.36">Detection covers detecting when the paths has been lost and when the path has been found during a scan. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p10.36">From these basic functions, it was possible to create a general method for following a track. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p10.36">Here, x denotes a variable whose size is dictated by the size of the gaps at junctions on the board. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p12.36">From the above, it can be seen that further methods could be written to move the buggy forwards, left, right and to scan for track. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p12.36">These methods, however, were found to be trivial (i.e. can be done in just one or two lines of code) so separate methods were not designed or implemented. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p16.36">The intended algorithm for using the buggy to solve a maze was a 'left wall follower'. </s>

<div2>
<head rend="bold">Preliminary Software Stage:</head>
<p n="p18.36">
<s n="s1.4;p18.36">Before beginning the actual coding of the software, it was important to understand how the sample code worked, and to ensure the buggy was functioning correctly. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p18.36">The tester program was loaded into the SWET and executed (exact details of how this was done can be found in Appendix A). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p18.36">The buggy functioned correctly so the buggytimertest.c code was compiled, loaded and executed. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p18.36">Watching the buggy's actions, examining the code and reading the accompanying lab sheet (see Appendix A) made it easy to see which lines did what. </s>
</p>
<p n="p19.36">
<s n="s1.5;p19.36">The next stage was deciding which method of driving the motors was best: signalling the motor drive pulse controls or using the timer. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p19.36">Code was copied from buggytimertest.c to develop two short programs which moved the buggy in all directions. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p19.36">There was a small problem at this stage as the buggy was making strange grinding noises as it moved, which hadn't happened when the test program was run. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p19.36">It was discovered that this was due to the fact that the delay between pulsing the motors was too short so they were slipping; simply making the delay a little longer sorted this problem. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p19.36">Having sorted this problem, it was decided that the best way to drive the buggy was to use the timer. </s>
</p>
<p n="p20.36">
<s n="s1.3;p20.36">During the testing, it was also discovered that simply pulsing the left or right motor was not a very good way of turning and resulted in a very large turning circle for the buggy. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p20.36">However, rotating one motor clockwise and the other anticlockwise provided a much tighter turning circle - the buggy pivots about the centre of its back end, rather than a wheel. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p20.36">This discovery was duly noted and this method was used throughout when rotation was required. </s>

<head rend="bold">General Board Software:</head>
<p n="p21.36">
<s n="s1.5;p21.36">Having done the above preliminary work to understand how the buggy worked, coding of the actual software could begin. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p21.36">The first stage of implementation was setting up the signals on the VIA. This task was relatively simple as the sample file buggytimertest.c required very similar signals to be set up so the project software was based on this. </s>

<s n="s4.5;p21.36">The main method was implemented next. </s>

<s n="s6.9;p27.36">It was decided that a right_sweep method should be included, along with a variable to store the result of the last sweep, i.e. if the line was found during a sweep to the left, the next sweep would be a left_sweep; if the line was found during a sweep to the right, the next sweep would be a right_sweep. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p27.36">The right_sweep method was implemented in the same way as the left_sweep but with the direction lines interchanged (i.e. *VIA_ORA = 0x31  *VIA_ORA = 0x32). </s>
<s n="s8.9;p27.36">Also, a return value of 1 was used to indicate a left_sweep should be used and a value of 2 was used to indicate a right_sweep should be used. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p27.36">The move method was altered to include a direction variable and to have different behaviours depending on the value of found. </s>
</p>
<p n="p28.36">
<s n="s1.2;p28.36">The final alteration to the general board code was to add in a few lines to print out (on the terminal screen) how many unsuccessful sweeps had occurred during a run. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p28.36">This was useful for deciding on the size of STEPS - if there was a large number of unsuccessful sweeps in a short period of time, STEPS should be increased as the buggy was probably not moving forwards far enough after a failed sweep. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p29.36">The whole program can be seen in Appendix B and is called buggy.c. </s>

<head rend="bold">Square Board Software:</head>
<p n="p30.36">
<s n="s1.5;p30.36">The implementation of the square board software was strongly based on the general board software, which required only small alterations. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p30.36">Having included a 'failed sweep' counter in the general board software made counting corners very easy as, on the square board, failed sweeps represented corners. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p30.36">A few lines were added to check if this number was divisible by 4 (i.e. a whole circuit had been completed) and, if so, to rotate through 180°. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p30.36">The rotation through 180° was accomplished by doing in a sweep in the opposite direction to the corner with a very large sweep size. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p30.36">The modified code can be seen in the program listing. </s>
</p>
<p n="p31.36">
<s n="s1.4;p31.36">As so much of the code was reused from the general board software, testing was relatively simple as the whole program could be tested together. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p31.36">The code was compiled, loaded into the SWET and executed. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p31.36">As expected, the buggy followed the square round for one rotation then turned round and followed back in the other direction repeatedly, until the reset button was pressed. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p32.36">The final piece of software implemented was to allow the buggy to follow a maze. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p32.36">The first stage in this implementation was, in fact, to build the maze board as there was not an existing one. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p32.36">Having created a simple maze from the black tape and white board provided, software coding was started. </s>
</p>
<p n="p33.36">
<s n="s1.4;p33.36">Like the square board software, the maze board software was heavily based on the general board software. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p33.36">Firstly, alterations were made to the move method. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p33.36">This involved altering the response to a failed sweep to make the buggy turn 90° left, then if this failed to turn 90° right until the track was found. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p33.36">The right_sweep method was not required so it was removed and left_sweep was renamed as just sweep. </s>

<p n="p34.36">
<s n="s1.3;p34.36">In order to test this code, methods for turn_90_left and turn_90_right were required. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p34.36">However, the design for this code was so simple that it was possible to create these methods entirely from code which was already known to work. </s>

<p n="p35.36">
<s n="s1.5;p35.36">This code was then compiled, loaded into the SWET and executed. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p35.36">As was explained in the design section, however, it was discovered that the distance the optodetector was much too large to make the rotation effective. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p35.36">The buggy rotated left but would be a buggy length to the left of the line at the junction so would never find the line. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p35.36">To remedy this situation, the second design was developed. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p35.36">New constants STEPSII and STEPSIII were defined and, through experimentation, new suitable values were determined as follows. </s>
