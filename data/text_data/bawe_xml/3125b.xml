<p n="p1.11">
<s n="s1.7;p1.11">This essay will discuss how lexicon is currently organised. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p1.11">First of all I will start by briefly talking about what the lexicon is. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p1.11">The essay will continue to the summary on how the lexicon is structured in recent perspectives. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p1.11">It will be explained with three approaches, lexicalization, sense relations and lexical composition. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p1.11">As dimensions of lexical composition, qualia and semantic primes otherwise known as primitives are described. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p1.11">It will also evaluate these approaches while explaining the contribution to the lexical field by theoretical and descriptive linguists. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p1.11">Finally there will be a conclusion about the new trends in the lexical field. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.11">
<s n="s1.11;p2.11">To begin with according to Crystal (2003) lexicon for linguistics means all the meaningful elements in a language. </s>
<s n="s2.11;p2.11">It includes morphemes such as prefixes and suffixes as well as the words and idioms. </s>
<s n="s3.11;p2.11">Singleton (1999) gives more detailed explanation on the meaningful units. </s>
<s n="s4.11;p2.11">He argues that these meaning units for example show colligation, collocation and lexical semantics. </s>
<s n="s5.11;p2.11">Colligation simply refers to grammatical necessity. </s>
<s n="s6.11;p2.11">The basic example of this is a restricted range of relations such as between a verb and the following complements (Singleton, 1999). </s>
<s n="s7.11;p2.11">For instance <hi rend="italic">prevent from Xing</hi>, <hi rend="italic">interfere with X</hi>. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p2.11">Collocation means combinations of lexical elements such as compounding words. </s>
<s n="s9.11;p2.11">For example it is an important element that a word, <hi rend="italic">green</hi> collocates with house in the lexicon (Singleton, 1999). </s>
<s n="s10.11;p2.11">In addition lexical meaning is traditionally defined as a concept carried with a lexical form. </s>
<s n="s11.11;p2.11">Alternatively sense relations which will be talked about more later on are mentioned to define lexical meaning in a recent perspective (Singleton, 1999). </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.11">
<s n="s1.21;p3.11">It is said that a great number of approaches towards lexicon have been seen moreover new approaches have also been generated. </s>
<s n="s2.21;p3.11">Some of the recent approaches explained here are lexicalization, sense relations and lexical composition. </s>
<s n="s3.21;p3.11">As a current perspective, the number of English vocabulary has been expanding because of the needs towards new issues in current affair or development of innovative words between young generations. </s>
<s n="s4.21;p3.11">Advertising campaigns have also stimulated the situation. </s>
<s n="s5.21;p3.11">Therefore a number of new words are coined or existing words expand in use (Jackson, 2002). </s>
<s n="s6.21;p3.11">Lexicalization is an approach to generate new lexicons in order to deal with the recent trend. </s>
<s n="s7.21;p3.11">It is originally a coinage term from Quirk et al in <hi rend="italic">A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language</hi>. </s>
<s n="s8.21;p3.11">There are notions has been expressed differently depending on speakers or writers since there is not yet a word for the particular notion. </s>
<s n="s9.21;p3.11">Jackson (2002) defines lexicalization as uncertain processes to name for such notions. </s>
<s n="s10.21;p3.11">
<hi rend="italic">Dieselization</hi> and <hi rend="italic">feasible</hi> are lexicalized words by Quirk et al (Jackson, 2002). </s>
<s n="s11.21;p3.11">Although it is assumable that the former infers a process by diesel oil the latter is not clear what it is meant by. </s>
<s n="s12.21;p3.11">In other words it is sometimes hard to recover the precise form therefore it is impossible to guess the original meaning. </s>
<s n="s13.21;p3.11">In addition conversion from nouns to verbs is considered a process of lexicalization. </s>
<s n="s14.21;p3.11">For example the following nouns, <hi rend="italic">a cup of coffee</hi> and <hi rend="italic">a mug of coffee</hi> are both commonly used. </s>
<s n="s15.21;p3.11">However <hi rend="italic">mug</hi> cannot be a verb whereas the verb version of <hi rend="italic">cup</hi> is acceptable such as <hi rend="italic">He cupped his hands and drank from the stream</hi>. </s>
<s n="s16.21;p3.11">Back-formation is another process of coining new words. </s>
<s n="s17.21;p3.11">According to Katamba (2005) back-formation is a process forming a word by removing affixes from a base. </s>
<s n="s18.21;p3.11">For example <hi rend="italic">television</hi> was firstly created as a noun and the verb version, <hi rend="italic">televise</hi> was coined from the noun. </s>
<s n="s19.21;p3.11">It has been also aimed to lexicalize a notion with clipping. </s>
<s n="s20.21;p3.11">Clipping is another process taking out a lexicon of words and shortening the form while keeping the same meaning. </s>
<s n="s21.21;p3.11">For example plane is fore-clipping of aeroplane and mike is back-clipping of microphone (Katamba, 2005). </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.11">
<s n="s1.15;p4.11">Sense relations are another current approach analysing how lexicon is structured in particular how a lexicon relates to the other. </s>
<s n="s2.15;p4.11">Cruse (2004, pp 143) defines sense relation as 'a semantic relation between units of meaning'. </s>
<s n="s3.15;p4.11">Furthermore the relations are between discrete units of sense (Cruse, 2004). </s>
<s n="s4.15;p4.11">The two main sense relations, syntagmatic and paradigmatic relations show the structure in different ways. </s>
<s n="s5.15;p4.11">According to Cruse (2004) syntagmatic relations occur between two lexical items in the same sentence. </s>
<s n="s6.15;p4.11">The relations are therefore found by looking at how a complex unit defined as a syntagm can be combined with other units (Lobner, 2002). </s>
<s n="s7.15;p4.11">Moreover it is necessary to consider whether a particular combination does make sense or whether the combination is normal or abnormal (Cruse, 2004). </s>
<s n="s8.15;p4.11">There are two kinds of abnormality between two senses, semantic clash and pleonasm. </s>
<s n="s9.15;p4.11">Semantic clash means that meanings do not match together in a sentence. </s>
<s n="s10.15;p4.11">For example the sentence, <hi rend="italic">my geraniums have kicked the bucket</hi> has a semantic clash. </s>
<s n="s11.15;p4.11">Since <hi rend="italic">kicked the bucket</hi> is considered as a human action <hi rend="italic">geraniums</hi> and <hi rend="italic">kicked the bucket</hi> do not go together in the meaning. </s>
<s n="s12.15;p4.11">On the other hands pleonasm occurs when nothing new leads to the other unit although one meaning adds. </s>
<s n="s13.15;p4.11">Therefore the combination results in an unnecessary process. </s>
<s n="s14.15;p4.11">For instance <hi rend="italic">a female aunt</hi>, <hi rend="italic">I heard it by listening</hi> include pleonasm (Cruse, 2004). </s>
<s n="s15.15;p4.11">It is clear that a lexical unit, <hi rend="italic">female</hi> or <hi rend="italic">by listening</hi> are unnecessary as the semantic meaning is already stated in the other units. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.11">
<s n="s1.14;p5.11">In addition differences between syntagmatic and paradigmatic relations are stated as follows. </s>
<s n="s2.14;p5.11">The former is an expression of coherence constraint while the latter works in sets of choices (Cruse, 2004). </s>
<s n="s3.14;p5.11">Furthermore the choices in paradigmatic relations are classified as inclusion and opposition. </s>
<s n="s4.14;p5.11">For example hyponymy, meronymy and synonymy are some representatives of inclusion. </s>
<s n="s5.14;p5.11">Hyponymy refers to relations such as between <hi rend="italic">apple</hi> and <hi rend="italic">fruit</hi> (Cruse, 2004). </s>
<s n="s6.14;p5.11">In other words apple is a type of fruit as are bananas or strawberries. </s>
<s n="s7.14;p5.11">Meronymy is another pattern of inclusion although they look similar. </s>
<s n="s8.14;p5.11">For instance in the relations between finger and hand, finger is considered as meronym while hand is said to be holonym. </s>
<s n="s9.14;p5.11">While the meaning of holonym includes the sense of meronym as a part hyponymy does not work like this (Cruse, 2004). </s>
<s n="s10.14;p5.11">In other words the meanings of hand somehow match the sense of finger. </s>
<s n="s11.14;p5.11">Synonymy happens in two words having more salient semantic similarities between them than the differences. </s>
<s n="s12.14;p5.11">For instance <hi rend="italic">big</hi> and <hi rend="italic">large</hi> refers to almost same meaning. </s>
<s n="s13.14;p5.11">On the other hand antonymy is used as a synonym for opposite. </s>
<s n="s14.14;p5.11">This is a basic relation showing opposite meanings between two words as <hi rend="italic">long</hi> and <hi rend="italic">short</hi> does (Cruse, 2004). </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.11">
<s n="s1.8;p6.11">The last approach is called lexical decomposition. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p6.11">The term is defined as 'an analysis into meaning component' by Lobner (2002, pp125). </s>
<s n="s3.8;p6.11">He argues that a meaning of lexical items is determined by identifying what components are in a lexicon and how they are combined each other. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p6.11">On the other hand the analysis is the converse process of how we fix on a meaning of complex words or phrases towards the components or the form (Lobner, 2002). </s>
<s n="s5.8;p6.11">That is where the name originally comes from. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p6.11">Lobner (2002) states the objects of lexical decomposition as follows. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p6.11">It aims to provide the meaning, to reduce it to the basic meanings and to give precise interpretation of the lexicon. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p6.11">It is also meant to explain semantic relations, to describe the components of lexical items and lastly to enable to compare the meaning across languages (Lobner, 2002). </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.11">
<s n="s1.16;p7.11">Qualia structure is one approach of the lexical decomposition. </s>
<s n="s2.16;p7.11">The approach initially proposed by American linguist, James Pustejovsky helps to achieve the semantic composition of verb and its object (Jackendoff, 2002). </s>
<s n="s3.16;p7.11">This approach starts with dividing features of lexicons into a number of distinct kinds called <hi rend="italic">qualia</hi>. </s>
<s n="s4.16;p7.11">The lexical properties should include rich internal structure. </s>
<s n="s5.16;p7.11">Furthermore the information within qualia works functionally in co-composition which is a process of constructing relations among lexical semantics in a sentence (Jackendoff, 2002). </s>
<s n="s6.16;p7.11">In the Pustejovsky theory qualia are divided into four patterns. </s>
<s n="s7.16;p7.11">As Cruse (2004) points out, formal quale enables to find a kind in contrast with other kinds. </s>
<s n="s8.16;p7.11">It means the hierarchical relationship such as among living things, animals, dogs and poodles tells the differences between poodles and other variety of dogs. </s>
<s n="s9.16;p7.11">It also distinguishes dogs from the other pieces such as deer or zebras (Cruse, 2004). </s>
<s n="s10.16;p7.11">Secondly constitutive quale informs structural information as a whole consisting of parts such as sensory and part features. </s>
<s n="s11.16;p7.11">Sensory attributes means for example, size, shape, colour and smell of the object. </s>
<s n="s12.16;p7.11">On the other hand part attributes shows information such as horse includes body, legs and mane as a part (Jackendoff, 2002). </s>
<s n="s13.16;p7.11">The other two quaila are agentive and telic. </s>
<s n="s14.16;p7.11">The former shows mainly its origin and where an entity will develop into. </s>
<s n="s15.16;p7.11">The latter includes information about a certain purpose such as characteristic action, current action or proper function. </s>
<s n="s16.16;p7.11">For example the proper function of a pencil is for writing with whereas action moving across the sky is a characteristic of moon (Jackendoff, 2002). </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.11">
<s n="s1.11;p8.11">Another type of lexical decomposition is semantic primes introduced by Anna Wierzbicka. </s>
<s n="s2.11;p8.11">The approach aims to describe all the meanings in every language while using a limited concept of semantic primitives. </s>
<s n="s3.11;p8.11">It is a system called Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM) in her theory (Lobner, 2002). </s>
<s n="s4.11;p8.11">NSM is composed of a combination of semantic primes and syntax. </s>
<s n="s5.11;p8.11">The semantic primes qualify two conditions. </s>
<s n="s6.11;p8.11">Firstly it is not possible to define the meaning of semantic primes while using the other expressions. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p8.11">It is also lexicalized universally in all natural languages. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p8.11">NSM is often concerned with other approaches to decomposition which are Dowty's decompositional semantics and Jackendoff's conceptional semantics. </s>
<s n="s9.11;p8.11">Although it is similar that the two approaches are also a combination of syntax and primitives there are a few differences to NSM. For instance the two approaches only deal with verbs whereas NSM enables to describe various word classes. </s>
<s n="s10.11;p8.11">For example emotional words such as <hi rend="italic">envy</hi> and interjections such as <hi rend="italic">yuk</hi> are also able to decompose (Lobner, 2002). </s>
<s n="s11.11;p8.11">In addition NSM is capable to define and compare word meanings in different languages more than the other approaches (Lobner, 2002). </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.11">
<s n="s1.18;p9.11">Before making a conclusion it is worth looking at how theoretical and descriptive views have been contributed to lexical field including the recent approaches. </s>
<s n="s2.18;p9.11">Lexical decomposition known as formula approaches has rich structures to represent meanings. </s>
<s n="s3.18;p9.11">Furthermore NSM enables to achieve language comparison (Lobner, 2002). </s>
<s n="s4.18;p9.11">These points are contributions of theoretical linguists who deal with developing models of linguistic knowledge. </s>
<s n="s5.18;p9.11">The linguists also have much concern on explaining linguistic universals in other words linguistic properties common in all languages (Wikipedia, 2006). </s>
<s n="s6.18;p9.11">However the approaches are weak in analysing meaning relations between lexical items. </s>
<s n="s7.18;p9.11">It also lacks the preciseness since the primitives are very general (Lobner, 2002). </s>
<s n="s8.18;p9.11">In addition it is not certain whether qualia structure is able to cover every single lexical meaning. </s>
<s n="s9.18;p9.11">Furthermore it is uncertain if these approaches can deal with the incredibly huge number of lexicon which is still expanding (Jackendoff, 2002). </s>
<s n="s10.18;p9.11">On the other hand lexicalization is relatively successful process of coining words by derivation or transformation from existing words which is what descriptive linguists approach in a lexical field (Wikipedia, 2006). </s>
<s n="s11.18;p9.11">However Jackson (2002) suggests the shortcoming as follows. it is not clear which meaning is converted into the coinage when a lexicon has multi-meanings. </s>
<s n="s12.18;p9.11">In the lexical field there is a new approach recently introduced by Cruse (2004). </s>
<s n="s13.18;p9.11">The approach called dynamic construal approach seems a relatively neutral approach. </s>
<s n="s14.18;p9.11">It mainly enables semantic meanings to be highly context-dependent. </s>
<s n="s15.18;p9.11">In other words since lexicons carry no basic meaning every meaning is temporary in a sentence. </s>
<s n="s16.18;p9.11">The lexical semantic therefore vary in the use of sentences. </s>
<s n="s17.18;p9.11">This is dissimilar to theoretical approach which lexical composition composed of syntax and primitives is highly context-independent. </s>
<s n="s18.18;p9.11">This approach also results in showing the semantic meaning much closer to the actual use which is what descriptive linguists aim for (Cruse, 2004). </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.11">
<s n="s1.5;p10.11">To sum up although a number of approaches towards lexicon have been investigated it is seen that every approach including the recent ones has had shortcomings in different ways. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p10.11">Therefore it is best to analyse how lexicon is organised from various views. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p10.11">It results in the advent of new multiplicity approaches like dynamic construal approach. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p10.11">Overall the lexical field will continue to extend further. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p10.11">In order to achieve this, further researching is still required in the fields. </s>
