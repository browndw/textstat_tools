<s n="s1.5;p3.28">Lasers have been around for more than 45 years and there has always been interest to generate ultra-short laser pulses in the picosecond(10 <hi rend="sup">-12</hi>s) and femtosecond (10 <hi rend="sup">-15</hi>s) range . </s>

Their branching ratio, CpFeCOCl+/ FeCl+, was maximized (solid blocks) as well as minimized (open blocks) by the optimization algorithm, yielding signifcantly different abundances of CpFeCOCl+ and FeCl+ in the two cases.
