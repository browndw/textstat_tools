<s n="s1.1;p1.20">Prior to the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999, the doctrine of privity "had long been a central, albeit controversial rule of English contract law",<ref target="BAWE_0191c-ftnote.001"/> and was defined by Lord Irving as "the rule which senior judges have criticised more than any other rule of English contract law".<ref target="BAWE_0191c-ftnote.002"/> The two rules of the doctrine were that a third party to a contract could not be subject to burdens arising out of it, and, parallely, he could also not sue upon it to obtain the promised performance, even if the contract was entered into with the express purpose of benefiting him. </s>

<p n="p2.20">
<s n="s1.1;p2.20">In order to determine whether there is a need in today's contract law for the doctrine of privity, it may be useful to trace back its historical development, analysing the character of contract law before the existence of a doctrine of privity as we know it, and considering the conditions in which it took root, until it finally developed into what was considered a fundamental principle of English law. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p4.20">It was only with the development of the doctrine of consideration that the right to sue came to be regarded as depending upon the plaintiff showing that he had provided a sufficient reason for him to enforce the promise. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p4.20">"During the early years of the 19 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> century, with the emergence of the bargain theory of contract, the view was taken that it was only the parties to that bargain who might enforce the obligations thereby undertaken", as seen in <hi rend="italic">Price v Easton</hi> (1833).<ref target="BAWE_0191c-ftnote.004"/> This approach was crystallised in the decisive case of <hi rend="italic">Tweddle v Atkinson</hi> (1861),<ref target="BAWE_0191c-ftnote.005"/> where the plaintiff was held not to be entitled to enforce a promise which had been made to his father, not to him.<ref target="BAWE_0191c-ftnote.006"/> Third parties were thus no longer considered to have a right of action; this marked a turning point in the history of the doctrine of privity. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p4.20">In fact, Wightman, Crompton and Blackburn JJ all appeared to base their judgements on the rule that a stranger to the consideration cannot enforce the promise; this eclipsed the need to explain the result in <hi rend="italic">Tweddle</hi> on the basis of an independent doctrine of privity. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p15.20">The Law Commission also considers the somewhat ambiguous maxim, "consideration must move from the promisee", and remarks that it may be interpreted in two ways; firstly, "it can be taken to mean that to be binding a promise must be supported by consideration", i.e., gratuitous promises cannot be enforced; it is essentially in this sense of consideration being a necessary requirement for a valid contract that the maxim was used in the Consultation Paper. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p15.20">The more common interpretation, however, is when it is used to mean that, "even though the promise is supported by consideration, the consideration must move from the plaintiff", i.e., the party seeking to enforce the contract must have provided the consideration. </s>
