<p n="p1.37">
<s n="s1.4;p1.37">This report outlines the application of two analysis tools that are utilised in the design of a formula 1 front wing and nose section. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p1.37">These tools are computational fluid dynamics and finite element analysis. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p1.37">Both are software programs that require a high level of computing power in order to produce accurate simulations. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p1.37">The discussion in this report considers the benefits and limitations of these tools and contrasts them manual techniques such as wind tunnel testing and prototyping. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.37">
<s n="s1.2;p2.37">An example FEA analysis of the front wing section shown above has been carried out using the COSMOSWorks facility in SolidWorks. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p2.37">The model has been assigned a material (carbon fibre aluminium composite) and various pressures have been applied to the appropriate surfaces to simulate the loading experienced at top speed. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.37">
<s n="s1.3;p3.37">The analysis found that the front wing and nose section was structurally sound with a minimum factor of safety throughout the structure of approximately 17. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p3.37">The analysis was subject to simplification however which means that the results cannot be treated as absolute. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p3.37">The analysis must only be used as a guide and engineers should rely on their own experience in designing a suitable component solution. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.37">
<s n="s1.1;p4.37">FEA provides formula 1 designers with a powerful tool for getting designs analysed quickly and without the need for costly prototyping and testing various solutions thus reducing the timescale which is all important in formula 1. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.37">
<s n="s1.3;p5.37">CFD is less well utilised although it still provides a useful analysis of individual aerodynamic devices. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p5.37">The computing power required for accurate simulations of an entire car is too high for our current capability. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p5.37">The experience and imaginative flare of the designer combined with testing in the wind tunnel remains the best solution for the aerodynamics department. </s>

<head rend="bold">Discussion</head>
<p n="p6.37">
<s n="s1.2;p6.37">Finite element analysis and computational fluid dynamics both play a very significant part in the design of a formula 1 car. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p6.37">In a sport where hundredths of a second can be the difference between the outright pace of two different cars, the teams spend huge amounts of money embracing technology that will enable them to increase the pace of the car by even the tiniest amount. </s>

<div2>
<head>Computational Fluid Dymanics as an Analysis Tool</head>
<p n="p7.37">
<s n="s1.7;p7.37">CFD is behind FEA in terms of its use in formula design purely because of the problems associated with computing the necessary calculations to simulate the flow over such a complicated vehicle. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p7.37">Even with the very latest supercomputers the aerodynamics department still rely mainly on the wind tunnel and track testing for developing the aerodynamics of the car. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p7.37">This is purely because the direct method provides more accurate results than any computer simulation program will ever be able to (with current levels of computing power). </s>
<s n="s4.7;p7.37">For this reason it is very likely that the engineers will continue to rely more on manual testing using the near full scale wind tunnels that they have invested millions of pounds in. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p7.37">This is shown by the recent investment that the Sauber F1 team (now BMW) made in a new full scale wind tunnel with rolling surface which became operational at the end of 2003. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p7.37">The Head of aerodynamics Dirk de Beer said at the time that "It's probably 15-20% of our personnel that are involved with CFD"<ref target="BAWE_0243e-ftnote.001"/>. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p7.37">The rest of the department is based around the wind tunnel testing. </s>

</note>
<p n="p8.37">
<s n="s1.5;p8.37">The design of a formula 1 cars aerodynamics is very much conception rather than an analytical process. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p8.37">Many of the best designers in formula 1 are happier to work at a drawing board working out the aerodynamic profile for a car than to play with a CAD model. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p8.37">CFD will be used for analysis of individual components but even this is restricted by the flow assumptions and boundary conditions that must be used in the simulation. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p8.37">The more components that are included in the model, the more computing power needed and the greater number of assumptions that have to be incorporated into the simulation. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p8.37">Therefore it is only by manual analysis in the wind tunnel and ultimately on the track in testing that a true analysis of the aerodynamic efficiency and overall performance can be made. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.37">
<s n="s1.3;p9.37">Aerodynamics is still considered to be a "black art" in formula 1 simply because the way in which the air interacts with the car is so complicated that even the best don't claim to fully understand it! </s>
<s n="s2.3;p9.37">CFD is therefore a valuable tool if a high level of computing power is available but it remains only a guide in the overall strive for increased downforce and reduced drag. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p9.37">The wind tunnel is the tried and tested analysis method and will remain so for the foreseeable future. </s>

<head>Finite Element Analysis as an Analysis Tool</head>
<p n="p10.37">
<s n="s1.15;p10.37">Since the introduction of mandatory crash tests in formula 1 and also the advent of carbon fibre composite as the main material for the chassis, FEA has become a very useful design analysis tool. </s>
<s n="s2.15;p10.37">Formula 1 cars are subjected to huge forces but at the same time they must be as light as possible for obvious performance reasons. </s>
<s n="s3.15;p10.37">This makes the design of the structure a quest for the minimum amount of material that will be strong enough to cope with the loads imposed on it. </s>
<s n="s4.15;p10.37">The crash tests that each car must go though are very rigorous. </s>
<s n="s5.15;p10.37">Given that the designers have to work to a very strict time scale they must be able to analyse a design very quickly and get an idea of how it will deform under loading. </s>
<s n="s6.15;p10.37">FEA is an extremely useful tool for helping an engineer to visualise what will happen to a component or whole section of the car under loading. </s>
<s n="s7.15;p10.37">The FEA gives a very accurate guide (much more so than CFD does in aerodynamics) as to the stresses, strains and deflections within a structure. </s>
<s n="s8.15;p10.37">This allows the designers to fine tune the design down to the optimal requirements before anything is manufactured for testing. </s>
<s n="s9.15;p10.37">Without FEA the design process would have to involve many more prototype models that would have to be tested on crash test rigs and in the wind tunnel. </s>
<s n="s10.15;p10.37">This is very costly and more importantly to formula teams it is very time consuming. </s>
<s n="s11.15;p10.37">FEA does of course have its limitations given that assumptions have to be made in the model. </s>
<s n="s12.15;p10.37">The component may well have to be modified after tests despite what the FEA model says. </s>
<s n="s13.15;p10.37">This is because, like CFD, it is only a guide. </s>
<s n="s14.15;p10.37">The results should not be treated as absolute. </s>
<s n="s15.15;p10.37">What it does enable though is for a better solution to a problem to be achieved much more quickly. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.37">
<s n="s1.3;p11.37">FEA can be used to analyse very complicated shapes that are extremely difficult to analyse by hand. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p11.37">The result is that complicated components can be optimised in that just the right amount of material can be used rather than having to be "over-engineered" to guard against failure. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p11.37">Such a use of FEA is that illustrated by the example analysis in this report. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.37">
<s n="s1.4;p12.37">In the fast moving cutting edge world of formula 1 there really is no alternative to FEA in the design process for the structure of the car. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p12.37">It provides a very accurate model for the behaviour of structures under loading and can be used for very complicated shapes. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p12.37">A very good design solution can be achieved that will need very little modification before anything has to be manufactured. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p12.37">It reduces the need to manufacture many prototype models that may be far away from the optimal solution thus using it as a guide, it allows for a solution to be reached in a much shorter timescale. </s>

</p>
<p n="p23.37">
<s n="s1.7;p23.37">Before taking these results at face value we need to examine the validity of the model. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p23.37">The pressure distribution on the surfaces of each wing element is assumed to be constant. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p23.37">This is not the case in practice, however it is not possible to apply an exact representation of the pressure distribution in COSMOSWorks and so the model had to be simplified. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p23.37">This simplification affects all of the results for stress, strain and deflection. </s>

</p>
<p n="p24.37">
<s n="s1.6;p24.37">Since the lowest factor of safety is 17, it would be reasonable to assume that the structure is sound despite the simplifications that have been introduced into the analysis. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p24.37">This means that the designer can modify parts of the design such as the shape of the endplates (these play a critical role in the aerodynamics of the car) without affecting the structural integrity of the wing section. </s>

<s n="s1.1;p35.37">The process of conceiving a design that combines the aerodynamic devices with their use as stressed elements in the design is very much a skill that the designer brings to the process through experience and not by simply analysing all sorts of solutions using an analysis tool such as FEA. </s>

<p n="p36.37">
<s n="s1.3;p36.37">CFD is utilised less as an analysis tool than FEA because the parameters governing airflow over the car are much more wide ranging and more complicated than the stresses and strains within a material. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p36.37">CFD therefore requires a lot more computing power than FEA. The uses of CFD are therefore restricted mainly to the analysis of flow over individual aerodynamic devices which can lead to problems of boundary condition assumptions that may not be an accurate simulation of what really happens. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p36.37">CFD is not currently capable of modelling the airflow over a whole car to sufficient accuracy for it to supersede the wind tunnel. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p37.37">The conception of aerodynamics is also very much an imaginative process based on years of experience in the field. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p37.37">The manual process of testing aerodynamic solutions in the wind tunnel is still the favoured analysis technique. </s>
