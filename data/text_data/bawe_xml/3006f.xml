<div1 type="section">
<p n="p1.6">
<s n="s1.5;p1.6">It is possible to suggest that the most clearly obvious way into both of these poems is on a graphological level; in both there is a distinct lack of punctuation. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p1.6">"Pan Recipe" is structured as one sentence, although this is complicated by both the many clauses, and by the separation of the verse into paired lines. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p1.6">"New World A-Comin'" is divided into three verses, each of which is also structure as one sentence. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p1.6">In both texts this is indicated by capitalisation at the beginning of the verse and a full-stop at the end. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p1.6">This is one of the techniques that give both these texts cohesion. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.6">
<s n="s1.9;p2.6">Both texts use lexical deviation as a method of foregrounding. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p2.6">"New World A-Comin'" is riddled with examples of words which could have several meanings and functions. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p2.6">This is often caused by graphological deviation; i.e. where the line ends in relation to the words and phrases, and the way syntax is used. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p2.6">The first three lines, for example, are particularly ambiguous in meaning. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p2.6">The line break between "this" (line 1) and "leader" (line 2) makes us question the functions of both words; it is unclear as to whether "this" should be read as a demonstrative article or demonstrative noun. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p2.6">If we take the former function, "leader" would be read as the pre-modified noun object of the phrase - a "Helpless.../leader"; if we take the latter "leader becomes adjectival and, if read as being hyphenated with "less" into a compound adjective (line 3), becomes part of a second simile. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p2.6">It is likely to be the latter if we look at the paralleled structures between these lines and the repetition of "-less" as a suffix. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p2.6">However, the syntax between lines two and three also confuses the word functions of both "leader" (line 2) and "less" (line 3). </s>
<s n="s9.9;p2.6">This mode of foregrounding through deviation reoccurs frequently throughout the poem particularly at the beginning of the second verse. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.6">
<s n="s1.7;p3.6">In Agard's poem there is also foregrounding in the ambiguity of the meanings of words, which is consequent of semantic deviation. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p3.6">The Caribbean poem is an extended metaphor in which Agard uses the vehicle of the steel pan to convey a sense of new life born out of the past. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p3.6">This extended figurative structure is further complicated by the use of the term "Recipe", and the semantic language and clause structures associated with cooking. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p3.6">Within the body of the poem itself are also many other examples of metaphor and also puns. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p3.6">In line one, for example, the word "rape" could be understood in two ways, depending on what function we assign to it. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p3.6">If we take the verb function of "rape" the line would read as a basic phrase structure meaning to 'despoil' "a people". </s>
<s n="s7.7;p3.6">However, we could also read this in a figurative, metaphoric way by taking the noun definition of the word, where "rape" is a rich yellow plant, which would then be functioning adjectivally in the metaphoric structure to describe the people of the past, from which the present has been formed. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.6">
<s n="s1.10;p4.6">Both poems also use semantic deviation in the application of animating verbs and adjectives to non-animate objects. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p4.6">In lines 19 and 20 of "New World A-Comin'" the adjectives "firm" and "fleshed" pre-modify the noun "flame" giving it human or animal like qualities. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p4.6">However, "flame" and can also be read as a compound adjective with "warm" at the beginning of line 21, thus acting as a pre-modifier itself in the noun phrase in which the "warriors" act as the head noun. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p4.6">This is another example of graphological deviation. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p4.6">In "Pan Recipe" the use of the present simple verb "stifle" animates the "drum", since a drum does not play itself. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p4.6">The verb is usually used in reference to the suppression, curbing, suffocation, or repression of a person or animal; these are the normal paradigms. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p4.6">Such foregrounding through deviation makes us think deeper about the meaning. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p4.6">If we read it as a metaphor and set it against the rest of the poem, we might take the drum to represent the steel pan music of the "people". </s>
<s n="s9.10;p4.6">Music is an abstract noun which, in a sense, is alive or animate when we can hear it. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p4.6">Hence, our reading would mean the stifling of the music which itself is symbolic of the "people". </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.6">
<s n="s1.12;p5.6">Although there are many techniques which create ambiguity through deviation, there are also many cohesive devices which hold these poems together. </s>
<s n="s2.12;p5.6">Both poems use sound patterning through alliteration extensively and to great effect. </s>
<s n="s3.12;p5.6">In lines 7-13 of "New World A-Comin'" the use of alliteration and sibilance is mimetic of the "silence" in line 11. </s>
<s n="s4.12;p5.6">The repetition of the unvoiced fricative /f/ and unvoiced sibilant /s/ also slow down the rhythm of the text which is broken at the end of line 11 through the use of enjambment. </s>
<s n="s5.12;p5.6">This is another example of foregrounding by graphological deviation; the use of the colon adds to this sense of "silence". </s>
<s n="s6.12;p5.6">In verse two of the poem, the repetition of the fricative /f/ works in a very different way. </s>
<s n="s7.12;p5.6">The way in which the air flow is not stopped in this alliterative passage gives it a sense of heightened action, which is echoed by semantic links between the words; "fire-arms", "fire", "flashed" and "flame" all have collocations of violence and even war, which is further emphasised by the reference to "warriors". </s>
<s n="s8.12;p5.6">In "Pan Recipe" Agard also uses alliteration extensively which generates a sense of rhythm. </s>
<s n="s9.12;p5.6">This in turn is mimetic of the dramatic language. </s>
<s n="s10.12;p5.6">The repetition of bilabial plosives in both lines three and five emphasise the "pain" Agard is trying to convey and echo the brutal acts to which the extended metaphor relates; the alliteration brings out the anger the persona of the poem feels about the cruel treatment of Caribbean people. </s>
<s n="s11.12;p5.6">This is added to by Agard's use of internal rhyme in lines three and four. </s>
<s n="s12.12;p5.6">The repetition of the diphthong /ɔi/ ("boil", "Foil", "voice") draws out these lines and thus emphasises the sense of time suggested earlier in line two "simmer for centuries". </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.6">
<s n="s1.3;p6.6">In "New World A-Comin'" the extensive use of parallelism is also a cohesive device which helps us to construct meaning from this largely fragmented work for example in the first four lines. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p6.6">Furthermore, it could be argued that there is a circular structure, whereby the end of verse three echoes the first verse in tone, mood, and in the semi-repetition of the abstract metaphor drawn between "soiled" and "silence". </s>
<s n="s3.3;p6.6">The cohesion in "Pan Recipe" stems largely from its genre as performance poetry and the consistent use of ellipsis - for example the ellipsis of the article in line five - and alliterative rhythms which echo Caribbean speech. </s>
