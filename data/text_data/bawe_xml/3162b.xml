<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">Sustainability</head>
<p n="p8.14">

</p>

<s n="s3.5;p11.14">Evidence from the national housing federation suggests housing prices in the north west over the past few years have not grown in line with the of the UK. As a result getting on the property ladder for a proportion of Liverpool's population is tough, as in order to buy a house many people will have to take a mortgage many times higher than what they earn. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p11.14">Local realtors suggest that the main reason for this rise is due to the win of Liverpool as Capital. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p11.14">(Liverpool Daily Post 2006). </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.14">
<s n="s1.12;p12.14">For the residents of Liverpool to enjoy a quality of life more needs to be taken into consideration than economic security. </s>

<s n="s4.12;p12.14">Furthermore it is suggested that when tourists travel to a destination much of their motivation to visit that specific destination is to view the culture. </s>
<s n="s5.12;p12.14">This is especially the case of Liverpool as it has been designated a title based on culture. </s>
<s n="s6.12;p12.14">Kotler et al (1993) suggests certain marketing factors need to be taken into account. </s>
<s n="s7.12;p12.14">These include: viewing the community and looking and analysing it from an external and internal perspective. </s>
<s n="s8.12;p12.14">As well as this it is important to take into consideration the goals and desires of the local community, and come up with a strategic plan. </s>
<s n="s9.12;p12.14">Finally the most complex challenge is implementing the strategic decisions which are made by the local community. </s>
<s n="s10.12;p12.14">If a strategic plan is not drawn out with regards to cultural preservation, the culture that the Liverpool desires to showcase may well be lost. </s>
<s n="s11.12;p12.14">Furthermore Ritzer (1993) proposes that if destinations are not able to preserve their culture they are at the risk of becoming a victim of 'McDonaldisation' thus a standardised global city. </s>
<s n="s12.12;p12.14">In many cases this was already evident in Liverpool with global companies such as Selfridges, Debenhams and international chains of hotels dominating much of the city centre developments. </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.14">
<s n="s1.4;p13.14">Cooper (1998) suggests as a destination develops the service it provides often becomes institutionalised and as a result the destination becomes one which attracts a large amount of tourists. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p13.14">Mass tourism can have many negative impacts , such as in Majorca an island which has totally lost its identity due to large amounts of tourists destroying many areas of its infrastructure not just environmentally but also culturally. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p13.14">Liverpool city council needs to control development after 2008, so it can control the amount of arrivals in the city. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p13.14">If they are able to do this, it is only then the 'culture' that the many stakeholders are wanting to achieve in the city will become sustainable. </s>
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">Conclusion</head>
<p n="p14.14">
<s n="s1.5;p14.14">It is evident that Liverpool City Council has a vital role to play in the development of the city. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p14.14">From primary and secondary research it is clear that the city has many problems and issues especially from an economic perspective. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p14.14">However the Capital of Culture title that they have won has given the city many opportunities to redevelop itself and make Liverpool into a world class tourist destination. </s>
