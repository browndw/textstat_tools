<s n="s1.6;p1.19">Conflict has been a feature of human society since time immemorial. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p1.19">Conflict can occur within states as civil wars, insurrections, or terrorism or it can occur among states as international war or outside-supported insurrections. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p1.19">Similarly, disputes can be organised around social class, ethnicity, religion, region, economic opportunities or some combination of these factors. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p1.19">Economists are increasingly concerned with the subject of conflict and peace resolution due to its impact on development. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p1.19">Economic and human development cannot occur without a large measure of social stability; conflict not only retards growth but also public funds are misused in military resources and it is the poor who are disproportionately the main victims of conflict. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p1.19">This essay will explain the contribution of economists to the theory of conflict and peace resolution and will use the region of Africa as an example, where civil war has been perpetuated over the years. </s>

<p n="p2.19">
<s n="s1.7;p2.19">As mentioned before war retards development, however, development also retards war. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p2.19">This double causation gives rise to virtuous and vicious circles. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p2.19">Where development succeeds, countries become progressively safer from violent conflict, making subsequent development easier. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p2.19">Where development fails countries are at high risk of becoming caught in a conflict trap in which war damages the economy and increases the risk of further conflict<ref target="BAWE_0226c-ftnote.001"/>. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p2.19">Traditionally, war has been viewed as an irrational act, brought about by misunderstanding and coordination failure, and primarily a breakdown in relations between nation-states<ref target="BAWE_0226c-ftnote.002"/>. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p2.19">Today, however, most armed conflicts occur between groups within the same nation, prevalently in low-income developing countries. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p2.19">Therefore, we will focus on analysing particularly the economic theory of civil wars. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p3.19">A profound gap exists between the popular perception of the cause of conflict and the results from recent economic analysis. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p3.19">Popular perceptions see rebellion as a protest motivated by genuine and extreme grievance where rebels are viewed as public-spirited heroes fighting against injustice. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p3.19">Economic analysis, on the other hand, sees rebellion as the ultimate manifestation of organised crime and the result of a series of rational decisions, where greed for income is the main determinant - income that can be achieved either from quasi-criminal looting during the rebellion or, if the rebellion is victorious, from controlling state revenues. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p3.19">As Grossman (1999) states, 'in such insurrections the insurgents are indistinguishable from bandits or pirates'. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.19">
<s n="s1.6;p4.19">Discussion of greed as a motive for conflict has mainly arisen in the context of natural-resource endowments, an abundance of which appears to increase the risk of a country falling into serious conflict<ref target="BAWE_0226c-ftnote.003"/>. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p4.19">Examples of conflict in mineral-rich countries include, notably, Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Sierra Leone. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p4.19">However, the rebellion has costs as well, such as the costs of labour and equipment needed to fight governmental forces. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p4.19">Moreover, the economic theory of conflict argues that the motivation of conflict is ultimately unimportant; what matters is whether the rebel organization can sustain itself financially. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p4.19">It is this, rather than any other objective grounds for grievance which determine whether a country will experience civil war. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p4.19">This is explained by the Collier-Hoefffler econometric model of civil war (Collier and Hoeffler 1998, 2000) which focuses on whether a rebel organisation will be established. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p6.19">The Collier-Hoeffler econometric model (CH model hereafter) analysed the patterns of conflict using global data for 161 countries for eight 5-year periods, from 1960 to 1999. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p6.19">In this paper, a civil war is classified as an internal conflict with at least one thousand battle-related deaths. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p6.19">Their model found three economic variables to be significant: the initial level of income, its rate of growth and its structure. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.19">
<s n="s1.3;p7.19">The model found that the higher the initial level of income per capita, the lower the probability of a civil war breaking out during the period. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p7.19">Per capita income can be interpreted as a proxy for the cost of recruiting rebel labour, hence, higher recruitment costs would make the rebellion more difficult. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p7.19">Similarly, more rapid income growth reduces the risk of conflict. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.19">
<s n="s1.5;p8.19">The structure of growth - the level of primary commodity exports relative to income at the start of the period - appeared as the most powerful risk factor. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p8.19">Countries that were highly dependant on primary commodity exports were substantially more at risk of conflict. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p8.19">The most dangerous level of primary commodity dependence was 26% of GDP; at this level the ordinary country had a risk of conflict of 23%. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p8.19">On the contrary, if the country had no primary commodity exports its risk would fall to 0.5%. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p8.19">Thus, without primary commodity exports, ordinary countries are pretty safe from internal conflict. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.19">
<s n="s1.7;p9.19">Additionally, the CH model found grievance to be of small importance. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p9.19">The model tested three measures of objective grievance: inequality, political repression and social divisions. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p9.19">Neither inequality nor political repression proved to be significant. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p9.19">This result is consistent with the view that groups with grievances are sufficiently common that differences in the supply of such groups between societies are not an important influence in the risk of conflict initiation<ref target="BAWE_0226c-ftnote.005"/>. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p9.19">Social divisions were proxied by ethnic and religious fractionalisation and ethnic dominance. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p9.19">Contrary to common belief, the model found that fractionalised societies have a lower risk of conflict since this makes it more difficult for rebel organisation to maintain cohesion while having members from different social groups. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p9.19">However, if there is ethnic dominance (if one ethnic group constitutes between 45% and 90% of the population), the risk of conflict doubles in comparison to other societies. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p13.19">Explanations of particular civil wars often invoke economic causes. </s>

<s n="s3.6;p13.19">Based on Grossman (1995) and Azam (1995), Collier and Hoeffler (1998) argue that war occurs if the incentive for rebellion is sufficiently large relative to the costs. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p13.19">In general, the incentive for rebellion is the product of the probability of victory and its consequences and the probability of victory depends upon the capacity of the government to defend itself. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p13.19">For a given population, the military capability of rebellion is unrelated to the domestic economy, whereas the military capability for the government depends upon its military expenditure. </s>

<p n="p14.19">
<s n="s1.4;p14.19">Furthermore, the incentive for rebellion conditional upon victory is determined by the capacity of a future rebel organisation to reward its supporters. </s>

<p n="p18.19">
<s n="s1.4;p18.19">His analysis also reveals significant systematic and regional determinants of war. </s>

<s n="s3.4;p18.19">Neighbourhood wars and long periods of peace also seem to be much more significant for ethnic war onset than non-ethnic war. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p18.19">This study suggests that some theories are better suited to explain ethnic war than others: it appears that modernization theory, with its emphasis on economic variables, is less applicable than theories of political development or neoliberalism, whose emphasis on the role of political institutions seems highly relevant as an explanation of the onset of ethnic war. </s>
