<p n="p1.17">
<s n="s1.6;p1.17">Ice cream is a complicated physiochemical system-colloidal system. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p1.17">Air cells are dispersed in a continuous liquid phase with embedded ice crystals. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p1.17">The liquid phase also contains solidified fat globules, milk proteins, insoluble salts, lactose crystals in some cases, stabilizers of colloidal dimension, sugars and soluble salts in solution. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p1.17">The finished product consists of liquid, air and solid, giving a three phase system. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p1.17">A typical ice cream contains about 30% ice, 50% air, 5% fat and 15% matrix (sugar solution) by volume. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p1.17">The ingredients of ice cream may be classified in three groups: </s>
</p>
<list type="bulleted">
<item>Major ingredients, such as milk protein, sugar, fat and water.</item>
<item>Minor ingredients (&lt;1%), such as emulsifiers, stabilizers, colours and flavours.</item>
<item> Modifying components, such as chocolate, biscuits, wafers, fruit pieces and nuts that are combined with ice cream to make products (Clark, 2004). </item>
</list>

<div1 type="section">
<head rend="underlined bold">Milk Proteins</head>
<p n="p2.17">
<s n="s1.4;p2.17">Cow's milk contains about 87% water. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p2.17">The remainder consists of fat (4%), proteins (3.5%), lactose (4.8%) and small quantities of inorganic salts. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p2.17">Basically, milk contains two main types of protein: casein (80%) and whey proteins (20%). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p2.17">Casein and whey proteins are distinguished by their differing solubility at pH 4.6 (at 20°C), caseins are insoluble, whereas whey proteins are soluble (Clark, 2004). </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.17">
<s n="s1.9;p3.17">Most of the casein proteins are present as colloidal particles, known as casein micelles (Swaisgood, 1992). </s>
<s n="s2.9;p3.17">Caseins are phosphoproteins. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p3.17">The phosphate groups are responsible for many of the important characteristics of casein, especially its ability to bind relatively large amounts of calcium, making it a very nutritionally valuable protein. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p3.17">All caseins have a high content (35-45%) of apolar amino acids (Val, Leu, Ile, Phe, Tyr, Pro) and would be expected to be poorly soluble in aqueous system. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p3.17">However, a high content of phosphate groups, low level of sulphur containing amino acids, and high carbohydrate content in the case of κ-casein, offset the influence of apolar amino acids. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p3.17">Caseins are quite stable to heat denaturation, but can be denatured by excessive heat, leading to aggregation and precipitation. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p3.17">As caseins are very surface active, and make good emulsifiers. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p3.17">Also, casein's high water binding capacity creates high viscosity in casein solutions. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p3.17">Consequently, casein has desirable functional properties for incorporating into instant desserts (Fox &amp; McSweeney, 1998). </s>
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="underlined bold">Whey Protein Concentrate</head>
<p n="p4.17">
<s n="s1.7;p4.17">Whey protein contains two well-defined groups, which could be fractionated by saturated MgSO <hi rend="sub">4</hi> or half-saturated NH <hi rend="sub">4</hi>SO <hi rend="sub">4</hi>; the precipitate (roughly 20% of the total nitrogen) was called a lactoglobulin and the soluble protein was lactalbumin (Fox &amp; McSweeney, 1998). </s>
<s n="s2.7;p4.17">The major advantage of whey protein's application in food industry is its nutritional quality. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p4.17">The main whey product developed-to-date is probably whey protein concentrate (WPC). </s>
<s n="s4.7;p4.17">Commercially available WPCs contain from 35% to 95% protein, 6-10% lactose, 4-6% fat, 3-5% ash and 3-4% moisture. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p4.17">The functions of WPCs in food products can be related to the functionality of their proteins. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p4.17">Interactions between proteins and other molecules within a food system are necessary for a protein to manifest its functionality (Zadow, 1992). </s>
<s n="s7.7;p4.17">The five tables below represent a more detailed review of the composition and functionalities of whey protein in ice cream and other food systems, and also possible modifications on whey proteins during food processing. </s>

</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p8.17">
<s n="s1.1;p8.17">An increased fat agglomeration index (FAI) provides structural rigidity to ice cream so that the melting rate becomes lower and better shape retention results. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p9.17">
<s n="s1.2;p9.17">Certain emulsifiers (e.g. unsaturated monoglycerides) destabilize the fat globules and increase the fat agglomeration, giving a more rigid structure. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p9.17">Additionally, agitation and the concentration effect of freezing increases FAI. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p10.17">
<s n="s1.1;p10.17">The lower the freezing-point of the mix, the more ice crystals will melt at a given temperature. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p14.17">Ice cream offers a unique combination of highly desirable sensory properties. </s>

<s n="s3.6;p14.17">To assess the sensory properties of ice cream, analytical sensory tests, such as difference tests and descriptive analysis, should be used with trained panels to provide qualitative and quantitative information. </s>
