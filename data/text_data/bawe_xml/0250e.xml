<head rend="bold">Authors Assessment of the Project</head>
<p>The purpose of this project was to fabricate and test a number of designs of microneedle array using a novel microstereolithography technique. The contribution of this project to engineering is to make use of computer aided design and testing techniques, and to apply these techniques to provide an economical alternative to traditional fabrication methods, such as micromachining.</p>
<p> The key achievement of the project is the successful fabrication of a number of designs of microneedle array, which may serve the purpose of extracting blood and plasma from the human body. Both simulated and actual force tests have quantified the axial strength of the designs, and thus allowed a comparison to be made between alternative designs. Although time and cost restrictions have limited the ability to test the puncturing ability of the arrays, the results demonstrated in this report provide a firm base for further research to be carried out.</p>
<p> The main weakness of the project is not having an accurate means of fully testing the microneedle arrays. Due to the micron scale geometry that is associated with the models, and the highly non-linear behaviour of the human skin, accurate results would require a large number of test samples, and precise instrumentation that would far exceed the time and cost restraints placed on the project.</p>

<s n="s1.3;p4.67">Blood sampling is a vital medical procedure, and is used for many different purposes, from assessing liver and kidney function, to controlling substances such as blood glucose and hormones. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p4.67">Traditional methods used to sample blood and deliver drugs to the human body can be inefficient and often painful. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p4.67">The use of hypodermic needles is a common choice however this procedure can cause significant pain to the patient and in many cases, is not acceptable when the rate of drug release needs to be accurately controlled. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.67">
<s n="s1.4;p5.67">There are many safety concerns associated with the use of hypodermic needles, with needle injuries accounting for 16% of reported incidents by NHS staff, totalling approximately 100,000 injuries per year <hi rend="sup">33</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p5.67">As a result of these concerns, alternative technologies have been investigated. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p5.67">The transdermal patch is a popular alternative, as it not only allows a steady delivery of drugs at most sites of the human skin, but overcomes many of the pain issues associated with intravenous injections <hi rend="sup">27</hi>, and is inherently safe. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p5.67">However, the tough outer layer of the skin (the Stratum Corneum) provides a highly effective barrier against most compounds and as a result, the transdermal patch method is limited to the transport of small, soluble molecules. </s>

<s n="s4.4;p6.67">Metal microneedles however, provide much greater strength and previous results have shown that skin permeability increased by a factor of four, with the application of solid metal microneedles <hi rend="sup">2</hi>. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.67">
<s n="s1.1;p7.67">The development of polymer microneedles has been shown to provide a more cost-effective means of production and due to its inherent biocompatibility with the skin; is a viable alternative to metal and silicon <hi rend="sup">13</hi>. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.67">
<s n="s1.2;p8.67">In previous studies, microneedle arrays were produced using techniques most commonly associated with integrated circuit fabrication and MEMS (micro-electro mechanical systems) devices, such as deep reactive ion etching <hi rend="sup">12</hi>, and LIGA (lithography, electroplating and moulding)<hi rend="sup">3, 14</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p8.67">Although many microneedles have been produced using these methods, the techniques used give very little control over the geometry of the designs, as the design form is driven by the manufacturing processes used. </s>

<p n="p64.67">
<s n="s1.15;p64.67">The microneedle arrays which were produced for testing embody all the optimal variables which have been investigated through the finite element simulations and the test builds. </s>
<s n="s2.15;p64.67">The stepped cone and inverted trumpet (figure 2.d and 2.f) were chosen as the optimal designs based on the results of the machine optimisation and modelling studies. </s>
<s n="s3.15;p64.67">To enable a comparison between the two designs, each was tested to discover the failure force, when an axial force is applied at the needle tip. </s>
<s n="s4.15;p64.67">This was performed using both COSMOSworks, and a spring loaded test mechanism (see fig. </s>
<s n="s5.15;p64.67">19). </s>
<s n="s6.15;p64.67">The CAD model was restrained at the base, and an iterative force was applied at the needle tip. </s>
<s n="s7.15;p64.67">By monitoring the calculated stresses, needle failure was assumed to have occurred when the maximum stress reached the maximum strength of the material (R11 Resin). </s>
<s n="s8.15;p64.67">The results of the simulation enabled a comparison to be made between the two designs, and showed the stepped cone to offer the greatest strength. </s>
<s n="s9.15;p64.67">However, there is some uncertainty with the simulations, since they do not take into account buckling as a mode of failure, and this suggests that needle failure may have occurred at a smaller force than was predicted. </s>
<s n="s10.15;p64.67">However, the studies on microneedle mechanics (ref.14) concluded that buckling should only occur when the wall thickness was less than 2µm. </s>
<s n="s11.15;p64.67">Since the microneedles which were tested had a much greater wall thickness, it is safe to assume that buckling would not occur. </s>
<s n="s12.15;p64.67">In contrast, the spring loaded test results produced a greater average failure force, than was predicted by the finite element simulations. </s>
<s n="s13.15;p64.67">These simulations calculate stresses on a point by point basis, by modelling the structure as a number of connected elements. </s>
<s n="s14.15;p64.67">Since the analysis does not treat the structure as a continuum, the results produce underestimated failure forces, as was shown by the results. </s>
<s n="s15.15;p64.67">Despite this, the finite element analysis has shown to provide an economical means of testing, and the results may be useful as a means of predicting a safe working load. </s>

<p n="p65.67">
<s n="s1.12;p65.67">Graph 7 and 8 indicate considerable variation between the different samples used in the spring loaded tests. </s>
<s n="s2.12;p65.67">There is some error associated with the method, primarily due to the way in which failure was assumed. </s>
<s n="s3.12;p65.67">Microneedle failure was judged by observing the tips of the needles as the force was applied. </s>
<s n="s4.12;p65.67">However, the entire array could not be examined for failure, as only the first row of needles were visible by the microscope. </s>
<s n="s5.12;p65.67">Observation of the samples after the tests indicated that 2 modes of failure were occurring. </s>
<s n="s6.12;p65.67">In most cases, the microneedles exhibited a crushing mode, similar to the simulated deformation shown above in figures 17 and 18. </s>
<s n="s7.12;p65.67">However, some of the samples showed that the microneedles were bowing at the tip, caused by an uneven load during testing. </s>
<s n="s8.12;p65.67">Although the uneven load produces inaccuracies in the results, it does provide an indication of how the arrays could perform, if they were used commercially. </s>
<s n="s9.12;p65.67">Since microneedle breakages did not occur in the tests, they would be safe in the environment, and would minimise the risk of injury. </s>
<s n="s10.12;p65.67">In both types of test, the results have shown that the performance of one design is similar with respect to the other, and no significant data suggests one design as the optimal choice. </s>
<s n="s11.12;p65.67">Despite the designs being considerably different in form, the tip radius of each remained constant, which suggests that this factor has the greatest influence of the strength of a design. </s>
<s n="s12.12;p65.67">This is consistent with previous studies on microneedle mechanics (ref.14), which has shown that the tip radius is the primary factor in determining the strength. </s>

<p n="p66.67">
<s n="s1.8;p66.67">This study demonstrates that microneedle arrays can be fabricated using a single STL process, to produce a variety of microneedle designs directly from 3D CAD data. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p66.67">A finite element analysis was performed to determine the optimal design parameters. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p66.67">The strength of a design was found to depend primarily on the radius of the needle tip, and the presence of a bore was found to only marginally lower the failure force. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p66.67">The finite element analysis was also applied to model the interaction between the microneedle arrays and a human skin model. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p66.67">Results have shown that the polymer microneedle arrays may be able to penetrate the skin before failing, however due to the non-linear nature of the human skin, a precise assessment could not be made without an actual skin insertion test. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p66.67">By optimising the parameters of the fabrication process, microneedle arrays were able to be produced efficiently, with a variety of geometry and features. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p66.67">These microneedle arrays were tested by both computer simulation, and by a spring loaded test rig. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p66.67">The failure forces observed varied from 0.205-0.263 N. Due to the ductile nature of the polymer used in fabrication, needle breakages were found to be uncommon indicating that the microneedles are safe, and would carry minimal risk of injury. </s>
