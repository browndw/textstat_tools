<s n="s3.6;p22.22">Furthermore, the sections corresponding to the lubricated and un-lubricated samples were analysed for grain boundary flow and the effects of friction were also manifested. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p22.22">It was suggested that the lubrication and consequentially the absence of interfacial friction had resulted in the homogenous and congruous flow profile signifying the stress magnitude across the section. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p22.22">The even flow pattern of the lubricated sample and its positive implications on material deformation was therefore linked to the absence of interfacial friction (lubricated sample) (?). </s>
<s n="s6.6;p22.22">The visual examination of specimen revealed, in general, that while frictionless upsetting resulted in even deformation, the presence of interfacial friction causes un-even deformation or barreling. </s>
