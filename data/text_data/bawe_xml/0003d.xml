<s n="s1.6;p1.11">At the eve of the Versailles conference, promoters of the Polish cause immediately realised the international precariousness of their aims to forge the rebirth of an independent Polish state. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p1.11">Moving with caution, Piłsudski, Head of State and Supreme Commander of the Polish troops, in December 1918 even went as far as addressing his archrival Dmowski of the Polish National Committee in Paris as 'My Dear Roman' in an attempt to reconcile the Polish feuding factions.<ref target="BAWE_0003d-ftnote.001"/> From the outset, it appeared that Poland's independence 'would depend almost exclusively on the endeavours of the Poles themselves',<ref target="BAWE_0003d-ftnote.002"/> however, soon after the official acknowledgement of Poland's Second Republic, the political struggle grew bitter. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p1.11">It was only the realisation of Soviet hostility toward their new western neighbour that forced the antagonistic political forces to work together in a somewhat efficient war cabinet, though even then with the greatest difficulty and resentment.<ref target="BAWE_0003d-ftnote.003"/> At nearly the same time that peace was concluded with the Russians in the Treaty of Riga, the <hi rend="italic">endeks</hi>, as Dmowski's National Democrats popularly came to be know, managed to pass an overly liberal constitution which left virtually no freedom to the president of the new Polish Republic and much procedural liberty with the <hi rend="italic">endek</hi>-dominated parliament. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p1.11">It was immediately recognised as 'a monument to anti- Piłsudskiism',<ref target="BAWE_0003d-ftnote.004"/> and left Piłsudski bereft of a meaningful role within Polish politics, despite his nationwide fame as Poland's liberator gained through his successful military operations against the Soviet troops in the war of 1919-21. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p1.11">The seed was thus planted for Piłsudski's initial decision to overthrow the government in 1926 by the National Democrats' uncompromising political attitude and wish for political domination. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p1.11">While the direct cause for Piłsudski's <hi rend="italic">coup d'etat</hi> can be said to have sprung from his 'personal ambition and intolerance', and obsession 'with the idea of Poland's unity and greatness',<ref target="BAWE_0003d-ftnote.005"/> it must be added that Piłsudski's frustrations were partly validated by the sheer incapability of the multitude of Polish governments quickly succeeding each other of dealing with a great number of urgent and pressing matters.<ref target="BAWE_0003d-ftnote.006"/> Thus, the reasons for the collapse of parliamentary democracy in Poland and the subsequent usurpation of power by the Nazi aggressors thereafter can be brought back to a number of reasons, of which Poland's 'own fundamental weaknesses, the instability of its institutions, and its irresponsible governments, as well as to the active and passive faults of the Great Powers' are the most important and general ones.<ref target="BAWE_0003d-ftnote.007"/> </s>

<s n="s4.8;p3.11">The same went for the small German minority of 3.9 per cent, whom, by conducing themselves 'in manner that was at once provocative and calculated to give notice that it regarded its status in Poland, and Poland herself, as temporary',<ref target="BAWE_0003d-ftnote.010"/> outraged the Polish majority. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p3.11">A long struggle between Poland and her minorities persisted throughout the <hi rend="italic">interbellum</hi> period. </s>

<s n="s7.8;p3.11">On the contrary, when Poland's first president, Gabriel Narutowicz, came to be elected with support of the bloc of minority parties, he was murdered within days after his election by the Sejm. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p3.11">Despite the <hi rend="italic">endeks'</hi> initial condemnation of the murderer, whom saw the election of a minority-dependent president as a 'symbol of shame', he was later celebrated as a Polish nationalistic hero.<ref target="BAWE_0003d-ftnote.012"/> Generally, the antagonistic sense existed, in which when the minorities, with the little representation they had in parliament,<ref target="BAWE_0003d-ftnote.013"/> exercised their rightful power, it was seen as invalid and unjustified by a wide range of centre-right and rightist Polonocentric parties, thus blocking the way for meaningful political participation of the minorities. </s>

<s n="s5.6;p5.11">While land reform was the way out for a country too poor to introduce any significantly contributing industrialisation, the National Democrats, with many landowning members, were reluctant to land redistribution of any real importance,<ref target="BAWE_0003d-ftnote.024"/> which in turn caused the anomosity of the peasant parties. </s>
