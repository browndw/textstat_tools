<s n="s3.5;p30.30">The chick and mice models discussed in the essay may be related to the limb patterning in other vertebrates, due to high levels of evolutionary conservation. </s>

<s n="s5.5;p30.30">Overall the patterning of the vertebrate limb is produced by complex and interacting signalling cascades, which set up the axes that are essential in producing complete and correct morphology. </s>
