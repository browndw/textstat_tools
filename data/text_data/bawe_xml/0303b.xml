<s n="s1.3;p2.26">I hope to show that these conflicts can be resolved and that we can be left with a notion of God as metaphysically within time and space, yet transcendent of the traditional four dimensions we occupy. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p2.26">As such, God is transcendent of <hi rend="italic">our</hi> time and space but not transcendent of time and space <hi rend="italic">qua</hi> time and space. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p2.26">God is thus epistemologically transcendent, conveniently explaining our difficulties in discussing Him. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.26">
<s n="s1.2;p3.26">Firstly, let us sketch some arguments for God's transcendence. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p3.26">Leftow (1997) argues that a temporally bound God would be less than perfect as he would be limited: </s>
</p>
<quote lang="English">'If a life lasts forever in time, always one part of it's past and another is future. So any life in time contains at least one limit.'<hi rend="italic"> Leftow (1997; 258)</hi>
</quote>
<p n="p4.26">
<s n="s1.3;p4.26">The other limit that Leftow alludes to is a beginning and an end of a life, but we shall assume here that God is eternal and so has no such limit. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p4.26">Now in the case of an imperfect being, that the past, present and future are segmented can be a bonus; we can forget mistakes we have made in the past and remain oblivious to the dreadful things fated to us in the future. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p4.26">In the case of a perfect being, however, such a segmentation is a hindrance to perfection; God is totally perfect, by not currently experiencing past and future perfections, the presently perfect God is not as perfect as the God that experiences the whole of His life at once: </s>
</p>
<quote lang="English">'In not living part of His life, God would lose some good in living it... Thus, having a past and a future would limit the perfection of God's life'<hi rend="italic"> Leftow (1997; 258)</hi>
</quote>
<p n="p5.26">
<s n="s1.1;p5.26">From Leftow's argument we can conclude that God either transcends time, or else His present is infinitely long, not the instantaneous now that we typically associate with 'present'. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.26">
<s n="s1.1;p6.26">There is an association with time and change; for things change within a time frame and different time frames are signified by changes in objects<ref target="BAWE_0303b-ftnote.003"/>, which leads to an argument for God's timelessness from Bertocci: </s>

<quote lang="English">'[C]hange...must involve either adding or subtracting, for better or worse. If a being is perfect what can there be to add or subtract?'<hi rend="italic"> Bertocci (1951; 309)</hi>
</quote>
<p n="p7.26">
<s n="s1.2;p7.26">Bertocci concludes that God does not change and many theists maintain that a changeless God is a timeless God. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p7.26">It is, however, altogether possible that God is changeless and yet within time; the association with change and time is not a necessary one. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.26">
<s n="s1.3;p8.26">To turn our attention specifically to transcendence and creation; God must be temporally transcendent if He is to create the universe, for if He is within time then He must be infinitely extended within it<ref target="BAWE_0303b-ftnote.004"/>. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p8.26">However, if God is infinitely extended within time then the Augustinian question of 'why did God choose to create the universe when he did?' arises<ref target="BAWE_0303b-ftnote.005"/>, and in answering such a question we must be considering changes within God, which Bertocci (above) forbids. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p8.26">Alston (1989; 133) concludes that '...if we are to defend the classical doctrine of creation we must come to think of God as nontemporal'. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p9.26">It seems that God must be transcendent of time, or at least He must possess an infinitely long present and be capable of creating the universe without changing in anyway. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p9.26">There are, however, reasons for believing that God must be within time and space, and to these we now turn our attention. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.26">
<s n="s1.3;p10.26">The argument from omniscience (presented in Taliaferro; 1998) is essentially that if God is outside of time and had knowledge of time it would be knowledge of time as a 'B-series'<ref target="BAWE_0303b-ftnote.006"/> and as such He would have no knowledge of what moment is present, even though He would know what all events were and in what relation they stand to other events (before, simultaneous with, and after). </s>
<s n="s2.3;p10.26">He would know that the event at <hi rend="italic">t1</hi> happened before the events at <hi rend="italic">t2</hi> and <hi rend="italic">t3</hi>, but He would not know that it is presently <hi rend="italic">t1</hi>. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p10.26">Although God would know everything, He would not know when 'now' is, God must therefore be within time in order to preserve His omniscience. </s>

<p n="p11.26">
<s n="s1.3;p11.26">However, this can be dismissed by relativising the present, i.e. if I occupy <hi rend="italic">t1</hi> then <hi rend="italic">t1</hi> is the present time, if I occupy <hi rend="italic">t2</hi> then <hi rend="italic">t2</hi> is the present time, and so on. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p11.26">God can thus know that for individual <hi rend="italic">x</hi> at time <hi rend="italic">t2</hi> that <hi rend="italic">t2</hi> is present, <hi rend="italic">t1</hi> is past and <hi rend="italic">t3</hi> is future. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p12.26">'Now' is thus relegated to the same relative status as 'here'. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p12.26">Some would not allow this move; Gale (1968; 215) argues that although it makes sense to ask 'Where are you now?' and receive an answer of 'here', the same cannot be said of 'When are you now?'. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p12.26">To ask 'When are you now?' simply makes no sense. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p12.26">Now it does not seem that 'When are you now?' makes no sense, it just seems that it is entirely pointless to ask the question, just as if we shared our spatial location with Bob and asked 'Where are you now?'; we clearly know the answer; 'here'. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p12.26">That our temporal location has so far been determined and that we are always in the same present as other objects is why 'When are you now?' appears meaningless. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p12.26">Suppose we can travel through time, suddenly 'When are you now?' is not so meaningless as time-travelling Bob can reply 'now' meaningfully, if not informatively. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p12.26">If we allow the possibility of time-travel as we do spatial-travel<ref target="BAWE_0303b-ftnote.007"/> then 'now' has as much significance as 'here' our current, fixed view of 'now' as privileged and granted is subjective and not the objective given that Gale assumes; 'now' is not necessarily now, 'now' could just as easily have been then, it is as subjective and relative as 'here' is<ref target="BAWE_0303b-ftnote.008"/>. </s>

<s n="s3.6;p23.26">As alluded to in footnote 10, the universe may have to exist in the extra two dimensions in order for God to have any causal powers over the other four; we just do not have epistemic access to these two extra dimensions. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p23.26">If we view a cube head on, it appears to us as a square despite it having a third dimension; depth. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p23.26">Also, if we cannot gain a change in perspective the cube will appear to us as a square and, as such, we will be unable to determine if it is a cube or a square. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p23.26">There is nothing incoherent with positing extra dimensions that are epistemically inaccessible. </s>

<p n="p24.26">
<s n="s1.5;p24.26">A three-dimensional object can cause changes to a two-dimensional object, we can imagine a cube striking a straight line and causing it to bend. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p24.26">However, the dimension that is influenced is the dimension shared by both objects. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p24.26">God may thus have to share the same four dimensions that we exist in; in order to exert any causal power over them. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p24.26">It remains to be seen whether a God transcendent of these four dimensions can have any causal authority over them, although if we see the universe as dependent upon God rather than existing in a causal relationship then this problem does not arise. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p24.26">It depends on whether we wish to view Biblical stories of an interactive God as literal or metaphorical. </s>

<p n="p25.26">
<s n="s1.1;p25.26">It must also be noted that finite objects can only affect other finite objects in the same, shared dimension, an infinite being such as God may well be perfectly capable of asserting Himself upon dimensions in which he transcends. </s>

<p n="p26.26">
<s n="s1.2;p26.26">This essay has hopefully shown that we can have a view of a God, in which He transcends our space and time, yet exists in space and time qua space and time. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p26.26">God's transcendence is likely to be an epistemic transcendence rather than a metaphysical one and although the extra dimensions posited above may create more problems than they solve, it does seem as though progress can be made on the issues bought to light in the essay. </s>
