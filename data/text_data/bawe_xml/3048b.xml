<s n="s1.8;p1.16">When Derrida famously declared that 'There is nothing outside the text', his words would have implications not only for literary theorists but for those 'guardians' of literature itself: publishers. </s>

<s n="s3.8;p1.16">This, along with the Post-Structuralist theory of the 'Death of the Author' challenges the publisher's traditional role as conservationist of culture, a role that relies on both the <hi rend="italic">intrinsic</hi> value of the text and its ability to represent a specific cultural period. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p1.16">Derrida's denial that a written text has any <hi rend="italic">intrinsic</hi> worth renders the publisher's role as gatekeeper obsolete. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p1.16">As what Richard Abel describes as a 'cultural gatekeeper'<ref target="BAWE_3048b-ftnote.001"/>, the publisher preserves the text as a valuable cultural commodity, insisting upon the posthumous life of the Author. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p1.16">Furthermore, the modernist desire to preserve the intrinsic worth of books by fighting against the commercialisation of the publishing industry has no place in Post-Structuralist theory, where the decentred commercial universe of the 21 <hi rend="sup">st</hi> century offers a textual liberation and plurality that can only be celebrated. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p1.16">Must Peter Barry's surmise that Post-Structuralism's "torch of scepticism burns away the intellectual ground on which Western civilisation is built"<ref target="BAWE_3048b-ftnote.002"/> then bring to mind a bonfire of our literary heritage? </s>

<s n="s1.7;p2.16">The cultural value of the work of literature came into question with the advent of Structuralism in the 20 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> century, which declared that "meanings are <hi rend="italic">attributed</hi> to the things by the human mind, not contained within them"<ref target="BAWE_3048b-ftnote.003"/>. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p2.16">Therefore according to Structuralist thinking a literary work has no intrinsic value: there is nothing stable or lasting for the publisher to preserve. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p2.16">Saussure emphasised that the meanings we give to the very words themselves are arbitrary, maintained by convention alone: convention that upholds both publisher and author as guardians and producers of priceless cultural artefacts. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p2.16">In <hi rend="italic">Mythologies,</hi> Structuralist Roland Barthes exposes the literary text as not natural but historical- while the publisher seems to suggest literary works are intrinsically valuable, they are in fact historically contingent. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p2.16">However, Structuralist theory allows that individual literary works might represent "some larger, abstract structures which contain them"; the culture that produced them, for instance. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p2.16">In this case, it might be valid to describe the publisher as a preserver of culture, a gatekeeper. </s>

<s n="s3.5;p3.16">The idea that language shapes our world means that this world is rendered one of "radical uncertainty"<ref target="BAWE_3048b-ftnote.004"/> and fixed intellectual reference points, including literary texts, are removed forever. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p3.16">Reality is indeed textual, but this means that it is impossible to achieve any knowledge through language: a book cannot really say anything about its contemporary culture. </s>

<ref target="BAWE_3048b-ftnote.006"/>
<s n="s4.4;p4.16">Indeed, Barthes rejects the very concept of Literature, proposing that "According to our norms, this Literature is an undoubted mythical system"<ref target="BAWE_3048b-ftnote.007"/> wherein the discourse and its expression in writing combine to create the myth that is the 'literary discourse', or Literature with a capital L: the cultural texts the publisher claims to protect .Both text and publisher have little place as cultural artefact and curator in a Post-Structuralist world. </s>

<s n="s2.14;p5.16">For Barthes, this assertion of the freedom of a literary text from the author's intention was the turning point from Structuralism to Post-Structuralism. </s>
<s n="s3.14;p5.16">In his essay 'The Death of the Author' he declares that the literary work is in fact undetermined by intention or context, the onus shifting from author and publisher to <hi rend="italic">reader</hi> in an escape from all forms of textual authority. </s>
<s n="s4.14;p5.16">As readers, we <hi rend="italic">produce</hi> the text, and there is in fact no 'real' cultural description or emotional state to reconstruct. </s>
<s n="s5.14;p5.16">Yet when a publisher uses the author to publicise a book at a book signing or promotion, he gives him authority as a 'god-like' figure. </s>
<s n="s6.14;p5.16">In fact, at the 2006 London Book Fair, Canadian author Margaret Atwood demonstrated new 'Long Pen' technology that will allow an author to sign a book anywhere in the world from the comfort of his or her own home, suggesting an almost omnipotent authorial presence. </s>
<s n="s7.14;p5.16">Barthes attacked this 'myth' of the writer as early as 1972 when he derided the bourgeois ideal of writers as "specialists of the human soul"<ref target="BAWE_3048b-ftnote.008"/> or "professionals of inspiration". </s>
<s n="s8.14;p5.16">The writer takes on a sort of god-like essence as Author, creator, indeed "a kind of intrinsically different being"<ref target="BAWE_3048b-ftnote.009"/> and this is in fact emphasised by the promotion a publisher encourages for him, details of the author's life publicised in order to make his artistic products all the more miraculous, even 'divine'. </s>
<s n="s9.14;p5.16">Barthes describes how novelists are immortalised and seen as 'spiritual representatives' of society: protected, Abel would surely say, by the publisher who is the 'spiritual gatekeeper'. </s>
<s n="s10.14;p5.16">The paternal nature of the publishing industry is antithetical to Post-Structuralist emphasis on the text as self-sufficient and plural: posthumous copyright, lasting seventy years after the author's literal death, moral rights of paternity and so on are all tied up in author-publisher contracts and insist upon the legal authority of both author and publisher. </s>
<s n="s11.14;p5.16">Foucault drew attention to the way that literary authorship has been bound up with copyright law and legal ownership of texts in his essay 'What is an Author?' (1969) </s>
<s n="s12.14;p5.16">When an author asserts his moral rights of paternity at the beginning of the text he is solidified from a "haunting but unspecified presence"<ref target="BAWE_3048b-ftnote.010"/> into a very real and specific figure. </s>
<s n="s13.14;p5.16">This is comforting insofar that it offers the notion "that there is a particular sense to that text"<ref target="BAWE_3048b-ftnote.011"/>, yet it means that he or she can no longer be a reader's personal projection but assumes an objective authority. </s>
<s n="s14.14;p5.16">We become one more "inert consumer to the author's [and of course publisher's] role as producer".<ref target="BAWE_3048b-ftnote.012"/> Yet in light of Derrida's declaration that an author is "dead insofar as his text has a structure of survival even if he is living"<ref target="BAWE_3048b-ftnote.013"/> the Death of the Author might seem to be highlighted by copyright law, </s>
