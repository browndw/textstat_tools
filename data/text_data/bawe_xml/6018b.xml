<p n="p1.19">
<s n="s1.7;p1.19">The effects of gender and class on the way we speak is a question that has engaged much time with linguists and has also caught the interest of the general public as the bestselling success of books such as "Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus" shows. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p1.19">If asked, any person off the street could no doubt offer you an opinion on the way people of different genders and social classes speak. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p1.19">This is possibly because the effects of social class and gender on language are so easily noticeable and so easily stigmatised. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p1.19">It is also because of the huge effect these two social variables have on language. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p1.19">It is worth noting here before the discussion proper starts, an important distinction, that is the one between gender and sex. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p1.19">Whereas 'sex' is a purely biological concept, 'gender' is a social construct - an example for instance is what one might consider <hi rend="italic">ladylike</hi> or <hi rend="italic">manly</hi> behaviour - this is an example of gender difference. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p1.19">This is important here as differences in the speech of men and women can be both down to biological differences (pitch differences for instance) or gender differences, but only one - gender - is relevant here. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.19">
<s n="s1.1;p2.19">As I have implied, the effects of these social variables is huge and a huge amount of research has been done into it. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.19">
<s n="s1.1;p3.19">Labov's famous studies in New York into social class also highlight a trend we shall see again; that is the higher the class, the more likely they are to use the standard forms of that particular language. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.19">
<s n="s1.8;p4.19">Labov demonstrated this by looking at a few variables. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p4.19">In the case of the post-vocalic /r/ variable Labov looked at three department stores with three quite different clienteles and staff divided upon class lines. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p4.19">In New York use of a rhotic /r/ in a postvocalic system is considered the standard or prestige form. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p4.19">Labov would ask a question of staff to elicit (without them knowing it and hence avoiding observer's paradox) the response; "fourth floor."He was then able to look at the level of rhoticity in the speaker's pronunciation of /r/. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p4.19">He found that 83% of the staff of Kleins (the store with the lowest status) didn't use the rhotic /r/ compared to Saks (the highest status store) where only 38% didn't use it (i.e. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p4.19">62% did) with Macy's in the middle of these two with 49% not using it.<ref target="BAWE_6018b-ftnote.001"/> Labov also looked at the initial consonant of words in such as <hi rend="italic">this</hi> and <hi rend="italic">there</hi>. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p4.19">Again, "the standard [ ] was more likely to be produced by middle-class speakers whilst the working-class speakers were more likely to use the non-standard variant [ ]. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p4.19">The class division in the study "corresponded roughly to the white collar/blue collar divide"<ref target="BAWE_6018b-ftnote.002"/> and both of these findings show how social class can have an effect on individual aspects of our speech and even just consonants. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p5.19">In Norwich Trudgill studied a different set of variables but produced similar evidence. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p5.19">Amongst other things Trudgill looked at the percentage use of either [ ] or [ ] in words such as "walking," the use of [ ] instead of [ ] in words such as "butter" and the amount of 'dropped <hi rend="italic">h</hi>s'<ref target="BAWE_6018b-ftnote.003"/> in words such as "hammer." </s>
<s n="s3.6;p5.19">Like Labov, he found that differences in use varied along class lines. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p5.19">For every variable Trudgill found that the higher the class the more likely the standard was to be used and vice versa. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p5.19">For example for the [ ]/[ ] variable the relative percentages (% = use of non-standard forms) were MMC - 31%, LMC - 42%, UWC - 87%, MWC - 95%, LWC - 100%. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p5.19">Again therefore we see that the higher the class of individuals the more likely they are to stick to standard, prestigious forms. </s>

</p>
<p n="p7.19">
<s n="s1.1;p7.19">The trend we have seen above has been reinforced by many other studies; the study of English in Detroit again resulted in similarly proportionate figures, whereas the UMC only used double negatives (the non-standard, less prestigious form) 2% of the time, the LWC used it 70%.<ref target="BAWE_6018b-ftnote.004"/> </s>

<s n="s1.3;p8.19">As well as social class, Gender also obviously has a huge effect on the way we speak - both in single sex and mixed sex conversations. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p8.19">Again, much research has been done in this field and it is this research we will focus on. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p8.19">Males and females often have a markedly different style of language use. </s>

<p n="p9.19">
<s n="s1.4;p9.19">Zimmerman and West looked into interruption in cross sex conversations. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p9.19">They differentiated <hi rend="italic">interruptions</hi> from <hi rend="italic">overlaps</hi>. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p9.19">An interruption they decided was a "violation of a speakers' turn at talk"<ref target="BAWE_6018b-ftnote.005"/> which involved "a deeper intrusion into the internal structure of a speaker's utterance than an overlap." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_6018b-ftnote.006"/>
<s n="s4.4;p9.19">The important word here I think is 'violated' - it is not something the original speaker would want to happen whereas overlaps are more occurrences that happen when a speaker is finishing their turn/utterance anyway. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p12.19">Goodwin's 1980 research<ref target="BAWE_6018b-ftnote.011"/> into the different genders' use of language came to the conclusion that women were more likely to use mitigated directives such as "we could..." when speaking whereas males more often used explicit commands such as "leave me alone!" or "gimme!" </s>
<s n="s2.3;p12.19">Along the same lines as this research as we shall see is research by Fishman and Lakoff into the different genders use of questions, be they tag questions or simple yes/no questions. </s>

<p n="p14.19">

<ref target="BAWE_6018b-ftnote.014"/>

<s n="s2.2;p15.19">Gomm showed that women for instance were much likely to use taboo language in same sex conversations (which tends to be with close female friends) possibly because the women did not want to look <hi rend="italic">unladylike</hi> in male company showing women wanting to conform to socially accepted roles. </s>
