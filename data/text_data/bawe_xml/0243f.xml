<p n="p6.56">
<s n="s1.3;p6.56">This report sets out an analysis of the company's performance using ten performance ratios based on the figures from the accounts set out in the company's annual report for the year ended 31 <hi rend="sup">st</hi> March 2005. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p6.56">The 10 ratios have been selected in order than a reasonable conclusion can be reached about the performance of the company over a five year period. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p6.56">The resources available include the annual reports for the years 2001-2005 and also the Fame database. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.56">
<s n="s1.2;p7.56">There are hundreds of financial ratios that can be used to assess the performance of a company. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p7.56">In order to interpret the accounts the ratios that will be used must give something meaningful in each of these four categories: </s>
</p>
<list type="bulleted">
<item>Profitability</item>
<item>Liquidity</item>
<item>Efficiency</item>
<item>Investment</item>
</list>
<p n="p8.56">
<s n="s1.1;p8.56">From the point of view of an ordinary shareholder the investment ratios will be of particular importance but if an accurate assessment of the company's performance and likely prospects is to be reached each category of ratio must be utilised. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.56">
<s n="s1.1;p9.56">The following ten ratios will therefore be used in the analysis: </s>
</p>
<list type="bulleted">
<item>Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)</item>
<item>Return on Shareholders Funds (ROSF)</item>
<item>Gross Profit</item>
<item>Current Assets</item>

<item>Price/Earnings (PE)</item>
</list>
<p n="p10.56">
<s n="s1.3;p10.56">The list of ratios contains three profitability, one liquidity, four efficiency and three investment ratios. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p10.56">The weighting towards efficiency ratios as the most utilised category is based on the fact that efficiency is the root towards profitability and success. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p10.56">It is far more likely that an efficient company will have higher profits and therefore a higher dividend for its shareholders than an inefficient company. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.56">
<s n="s1.5;p11.56">The objectives of this report are to use the ten ratios outlined above in conjunction with the annual report to provide an assessment of the company's performance for the year ended 31 <hi rend="sup">st</hi> March 2005. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p11.56">The analysis will be a five year review from 2001 to 2005. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p11.56">The report will be scrutinised so that an assessment can be made as to whether or not the annual report gives a true and fair view of the financial performance of the company. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p11.56">The change to the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and its affects on the company's accounts will also be considered. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p11.56">A recommendation to an ordinary shareholder will be made based on the finding of the ratio analysis. </s>

<p n="p13.56">
<s n="s1.6;p13.56">An initial glance at the financial summary for the year ended 31 <hi rend="sup">st</hi> March 2005 suggests that the year was not a successful one for Renold. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p13.56">Although turnover was up £4.9m on 2004 to £197m from £192.1m, the company recorded a pre-tax loss of £6.8m compared with £4.7m (restated) pre-tax profit in 2004. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p13.56">This is due to a significant increase in the cost of exceptional items that was incurred in 2005 compared with 2004 and also the goodwill impairment of £2.4m associated with the acquisition of Jones and Shipman. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p13.56">The major factor that is highlighted in the annual report however is the significant rise in the cost of raw materials compared with the previous year. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p13.56">Steel prices rose by approximately 40% and have since stabilised at this higher level of cost. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p13.56">The result of this has been very damaging since, for example, the chain division uses almost entirely steel for the manufacture of their products. </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.56">
<s n="s1.2;p14.56">Other factors that are mentioned include the relative weakness of the US Dollar compared to both the Pound and the Euro. </s>

<s n="s3.5;p19.56">The trend in profitability appears to be downward although 2005 was a year in which exceptional items were high compared to previous years and the cost of raw materials significantly higher. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p19.56">2005 looks like a bad year but Renold still made a £3.7m pre-tax profit before goodwill and exceptional items are taken into account. </s>
