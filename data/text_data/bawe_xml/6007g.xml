<s n="s1.4;p14.16">Heath species were the most efficient plants at colonising the bare ground (pioneer stage of heather development) along with herbaceous plants, lichens and acrocarpous mosses However, from 5-15 years the heather is in its 'building' phase, and with gorse forms a continuous canopy > 50 cm shading out light underneath. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p14.16">The herbs, lichens and acrocarp mosses are out-competed due to lack of light. </s>

<s n="s4.4;p14.16">During the 'mature' phase of heather at ~20 years, acrocarps appear for a second time as the more 'leggy' heather allows more light under the canopy, and replace the pleurocarps. </s>

<p n="p15.16">
<s n="s1.3;p15.16">Heather species are dominant the whole way through this succession. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p15.16">The reason heather is so successful re-colonising is due to the coppicing effect burning has on the heather. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p15.16">Not only does the fire stimulate seed germination and promote seedling growth, it also encourages growth of new shoots from original plants that survived the fire. </s>

<p n="p16.16">
<s n="s1.4;p16.16">However, when degenerate (>25 years), more light-demanding species will return, including tree species. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p16.16">If left unmanaged, succession would continue on to woodland. </s>
