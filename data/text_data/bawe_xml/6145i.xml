<s n="s2.3;p2.27">High yielding dairy cows in modern farming practices are pushed to their limits through a combination of high protein feeds, selective breeding and the latest technology (Lymbery 2001). </s>

<s n="s1.3;p5.27">The five freedoms mentioned in the above table highlight the issues that are faced by dairy farmers, with regards to the welfare of their livestock and ways in which they can try and ensure that the welfare of the dairy cows is not compromised. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p5.27">These freedoms do not just relate to high yielding dairy cows. </s>

<head rend="underlined bold">Issues with High Yielding Dairy Cows</head>
<p n="p6.27">
<s n="s1.6;p6.27">In recent years the average life span of dairy cows has reduced and it is often less than four lactations (FAWC 1997). </s>
<s n="s2.6;p6.27">This issue can be associated with high productivity that is related to high yielding dairy cows. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p6.27">High production can lead to increased levels of metabolic stress which in turn will lead to earlier culling. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p6.27">Culling is also increasing and occurring more frequently due to an increase in lameness and infectious diseases that are associated with the high intensity milk production systems. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p6.27">On many dairy farms, culling rates exceed 30-35% of the herd per annum (Jones 1999). </s>

<item>Infertility</item>

<head rend="underlined bold">Mastitis</head>
<p n="p10.27">
<s n="s1.6;p10.27">Mastitis is an inflammation of the udder that is usually caused by a bacterial infection, although it can also be triggered by stress (FAWC 1997). </s>
<s n="s2.6;p10.27">Mastitis is a problem that is often associated with high yielding dairy cows. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p10.27">The pathogens of mastitis are usually either environmental or contagious. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p10.27">Contagious pathogens spread from infected areas to healthy areas of the same or other cows, such as from the milking machine or the herdsman (FAWC 1997). </s>
<s n="s5.6;p10.27">Environmental pathogens are usually associated with dirty wet bedding or poor ventilation in housed areas. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p10.27">Mastitis results in reduced quality and quantity of milk and therefore can have a negative effect on the economics of milk production. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.27">
<s n="s1.2;p11.27">A five point plan was introduced in the 1960s to try and combat mastitis. </s>

</list>
<p n="p12.27">
<s n="s1.4;p12.27">Since the recommendations there has been great uptake of the plan and it has lead to a decline in contagious mastitis. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p12.27">However, there has been no change in the incidence of environmental mastitis (Blowey and Edmondson 1995) and this is mainly due to the increase in herd sizes which is related to higher milk yields. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p12.27">This is mainly due to the increased milking speeds, which are leading to 'a 12 fold increase in mastitis susceptibility' (Blowey and Edmondson pg 2 1995). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p12.27">This suggests that the policy of promoting yet higher yields in dairy cows should be stopped unless further preventative action for environmental mastitis is introduced. </s>

<s n="s2.3;p13.27">Lameness is seen as a major welfare issue because it affects the cow's ability to fully interact with the environment, and also causes unnecessary pain and distress (FAWC 1997). </s>

<s n="s1.5;p15.27">Infertility is a major problem in UK dairy herds and can have serious economical impacts on the farm. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p15.27">Poor nutrition, metabolic stress and poor heat detection have been associated with causes of infertility. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p15.27">While infertility itself is not seen as a major welfare issue, many infertile cows are prematurely culled which is seen as a welfare issue. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p15.27">It is 'Cows with the greatest milk production that have the highest incidence of infertility' (Lucy 2001). </s>
<s n="s5.5;p15.27">This therefore suggests that although infertility is a problem experienced by all dairy farmers, it is more significant in high yielding dairy cows. </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.27">
<s n="s1.3;p16.27">Other Production Diseases can also be associated with high yielding dairy cows, such as an increased incidence of ketosis. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p16.27">This usually occurs in early lactation and is a result of an overworked metabolism, which results in the cows having to use their own energy resources to continue producing milk (Lymbery 2001). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p16.27">Ketosis can be caused by an imbalance of nutrients in the diet, but also if other diseases have occurred which lead to a reduction in appetite and therefore feed intake (Andrews 2000). </s>

<s n="s1.3;p17.27">There are many diseases and illnesses which seem to be linked to high yielding dairy cows. </s>

<p n="p25.27">
<s n="s1.5;p25.27">There are many arguments both for and against promoting the policy of yet higher yields in dairy cows. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p25.27">Many of the welfare issues mentioned in the argument against higher yielding dairy cows are common both in average yield dairy cows and higher yielding dairy cows. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p25.27">However, these issues do seem to be more severe and frequent in higher yielding dairy cows. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p25.27">There is also greater culling in higher yielding dairy cows which is associated with the increased production diseases that are prevalent in the higher yielding herds. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p25.27">Greater and earlier culling is also associated with a reduced average life span in higher yielding dairy cows, which is seen to be a welfare issue. </s>
</p>
<p n="p26.27">
<s n="s1.3;p26.27">There are factors such as selective breeding which can help to improve the condition of higher yielding dairy cows, but these factors alone cannot significantly contribute to reducing factors such as lameness and infertility which are commonly associated with the higher yielding dairy cows. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p26.27">This therefore indicates that although steps are taken to ensure that higher yielding dairy cows do not have their welfare compromised, there are still issues that do affect them. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p26.27">The Protection of Animals Act 1911 - 2000 does help to ensure that the welfare of such animals is not threatened, but these intensively farmed animals are still put under significantly more pressure and stress than other dairy cows. </s>
</p>
<p n="p27.27">
<s n="s1.3;p27.27">High yielding dairy cows do produce higher gross margins per cow and per hectare (see table 2). </s>
<s n="s2.3;p27.27">However, these gross margins do not take into account factors such as the stress and production diseases or issues that can be associated with the higher yielding cows. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p27.27">Therefore although there are steps in place to ensure that the welfare of higher yielding dairy cows is not compromised, so far I feel that there still many issues that surround the higher yielding dairy cows and as a result the policy of promoting yet higher yields in dairy cows should be stopped. </s>
