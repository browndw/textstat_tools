<p n="p8.60">
<s n="s1.7;p8.60">Dudley Zoo houses a group of seven female chimpanzees. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p8.60">The only male in the group died in 2005 of natural causes, making it the only known all-female group of captive chimpanzees in a UK zoo. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p8.60">I can find no documentation of current all-female groups of chimpanzees in other captive settings, though there may be some in research laboratories or zoos elsewhere. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p8.60">It is of interest whether this living arrangement in any way impacts upon the behaviour of the female chimpanzees, when compared to females living in mixed sex groups. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p8.60">To try to investigate this, I will be comparing the activity budgets and social behaviour of the all-female group with four other groups of zoo chimpanzees of similar size which include adult males. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p8.60">I will use focal animal instantaneous samples, along with group scans. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p8.60">With five groups I would have enough samples to undertake statistical analysis. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.60">
<s n="s1.7;p9.60">Preliminary observations and anecdotal narratives from keepers at Dudley Zoo suggest that there may be a limited amount of activity among the group of female chimpanzees, and a hypothesis can be stated that the absence of males decreases the amount of activity among females. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p9.60">As well as making comparisons to four other groups of chimps, I will also address the activity budgets of wild chimpanzees, to see if there is any difference. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p9.60">Social relationships are crucial to the well-being of chimpanzees (ILAR, 1998). </s>
<s n="s4.7;p9.60">Anecdotal observations suggest few agonistic exchanges among the all-female group, and again this will be compared to the mixed-sex groups. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p9.60">If there are behavioural social differences, they may be due to individual personalities, housing conditions, kin relationship, changing social structure, age, reproductive state, season, climate or other factors. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p9.60">However, it may also be in part because of the absence of males in the group. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p9.60">If the hypothesis holds and this appears to be the case, this style of social housing has implications for captive chimpanzee management and may raise questions about whether to keep groups stable or make changes. </s>

<head rend="underlined bold">Project Aims</head>
<p n="p19.60">
<s n="s1.5;p19.60">In the wild, female chimpanzees leave their natal groups upon reaching adolescence, so it is unusual to find groups of females together (Lehmann and Boesch, 2004). </s>
<s n="s2.5;p19.60">Chimpanzees in the Tai Forest appear to be more homosexually bonded than in other communities (Boesch, 1996). </s>
<s n="s3.5;p19.60">Studies from other sites have reported less sociality among wild chimpanzee females than among males (for an overview see Sugiyama, 1973). </s>
<s n="s4.5;p19.60">However, in captivity there is no opportunity for emigration, so social structures are different to those found in the wild (de Waal, 1994). </s>
<s n="s5.5;p19.60">Chimpanzees can be found in captivity in large mixed groups, small mixed groups, same-sex groups, dyads and in isolation (Brent, 2001). </s>
</p>
<p n="p20.60">
<s n="s1.3;p20.60">It could be important for captive management to compare female behaviour with the presence and absence of males. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p20.60">The main aims are to investigate whether life is more or less active for females in all-female rather than mixed-sex groups, and to compare agonistic and affiliative behaviours in their social interactions. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p20.60">The stability of social groupings may be a key factor in the behaviour of the individuals (Jensvoldal. 2005). </s>
</p>
<p n="p21.60">
<s n="s1.4;p21.60">It is hoped the data will provide caregivers and zoo managers information about the amount of time spent active and inactive, as this may be of concern. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p21.60">It will also be important to compare these data on activity budgets and social behaviour among female chimpanzees in the wild, where up to 40% of the day is reportedly spent inactive (Doran, 1997). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p21.60">The project aims to offer these findings to zoo managers for their consideration when planning group structures, and to add to the discussion about how naturalistic zoo housing should aim to be (Baker and Smuts, 1994; Lindberg and Coe, 1995). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p21.60">It may help in discussions about whether to alter social structures in the future. </s>

<head rend="bold">Why do you consider the species to be a flagship? </head>
<p n="p25.60">
<s n="s1.7;p25.60">The endangered status of chimpanzees makes them particularly important to zoos. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p25.60">For example, Twycross Zoo states that "In 1972 the zoo became a charitable trust concentrating on conservation and education, and now takes part in many captive breeding programmes for endangered animals (about three quarters of the animals housed at Twycross are officially classed as endangered species)" (Twycross Zoo, 2005). </s>
<s n="s3.7;p25.60">This year a female chimpanzee at Twycross Zoo; Mukundu, gave birth to a female infant. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p25.60">With more animals being born into captivity any study which makes observations about zoo chimpanzees may offer suggestions to assist the psychological, physical and reproductive well-being of those animals. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p25.60">Chimpanzees are characterised by many conservation organisations as "charismatic megafauna" (WCS, 2005), and therefore have a role as a flagship for endangered apes. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p25.60">It could be argued that chimpanzees are not endangered in captivity, as they are the most widely held captive great apes (Brent, 2001). </s>
<s n="s7.7;p25.60">However, the fact that there are many of them also means that there are more animals whose lives can be improved by better management, and there are also more educational opportunities for people to see chimpanzees and learn about them. </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="underlined bold">What main problem or threat is this project intending to address? </head>
<p n="p26.60">
<s n="s1.10;p26.60">Comparatively little research has been undertaken on the behaviour of female chimpanzees, when compared with the amount of observations made on male behaviour (Baker and Smuts, 1994). </s>
<s n="s2.10;p26.60">The opportunity to observe an all-female group of chimps offers a unique opportunity to see if the absence or presence of males affects behaviour. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p26.60">It is an opportunity to focus on females. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p26.60">Based on anecdotal reports from keepers, and informal observations, a hypothesis could be made that life in an all-female chimpanzee group is less active than in a mixed-group. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p26.60">The study will provide a comparison between activity and social behaviour among single-sex and mixed-sex groups of chimpanzees, as well as references to literature about social behaviour in wild groups. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p26.60">The project will examine if the type of social grouping does have an impact on behaviour, or if there is no change, or if other factors play a role. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p26.60">A reduced level of activity may be something that zoo managers may wish to address, and it may lead to discussions about whether to alter the social structure. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p26.60">It is an important ongoing issue for animal management to assess how naturalistic a captive environment should be (Baker and Smuts, 1994; Lindberg and Coe, 1995). </s>
<s n="s9.10;p26.60">This does not just extend to the type of housing used in zoos, but also includes the structure of a social group (Murray, 1998). </s>
<s n="s10.10;p26.60">However, activity levels and amounts of social behaviour should not be automatically correlated with abnormality or problems with psychological well-being (Dawkins, 2003). </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="underlined bold">How was this problem or threat identified and by whom? </head>
<p n="p27.60">
<s n="s1.4;p27.60">Anecdotal conversations with animal caregivers at various zoos suggest that the social structure of chimpanzee groups in zoos causes some concern, with regards to the well-being of the animals and the stresses caused to both the chimpanzees, and to keepers and visitors if problems arise. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p27.60">No research has been undertaken on an all-female group of captive chimpanzees in a UK zoo, and the research department at Dudley Zoo is keen for a comparison to be made between this group and mixed-sex groups at other institutions. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p27.60">It is hoped this can help informed discussions about whether to leave the group as it is or to seek to change the social structure. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p27.60">Research departments at the other four zoos involved in this project are also interested in an analysis of activity and behaviour in their chimpanzee groups, as this may identify issues to address. </s>

<s n="s2.7;p28.60">Twycross Zoo hopes to "build up an extensive library of research from which we can continue to improve the animals surroundings" (Twycross Zoo, 2005). </s>
<s n="s3.7;p28.60">Colchester Zoo believes "studies that have been selected within the behaviour section generally have a value for captive animal management" (Colchester Zoo, 2005). </s>
<s n="s4.7;p28.60">This project accords with the research priority of "evolution of social behaviour" at the Institute of Zoology (Whipsnade Wild Animal Park, 2005). </s>
<s n="s5.7;p28.60">Edinburgh Zoo offers "a unique opportunity for studying animals up close, and for conducting research which would be extremely difficult or impossible in the field" (Edinburgh Zoo, 2005). </s>

<head rend="underlined bold">How does this project relate to previous work in the area or on the same species? </head>
<p n="p29.60">
<s n="s1.13;p29.60">Many studies have been done on chimpanzee group behaviour. </s>
<s n="s2.13;p29.60">De Waal (2005) gives an overview of the breadth of chimpanzee research with its beginnings in laboratory studies before shifting to behavioural observations in the wild. </s>
<s n="s3.13;p29.60">Over four decades of in-situ research in Africa, theories have shifted about group dynamics among chimpanzees. </s>
<s n="s4.13;p29.60">In an overview of the literature, Stanford (1998) and Sugiyama (1973) describe how in the 1960s it was thought there was no structure to chimpanzee society. </s>
<s n="s5.13;p29.60">A decade later this idea had shifted to the concept of chimpanzee communities, where chimpanzees form part of a fluid 'unit group' made up of small parties. </s>
<s n="s6.13;p29.60">Observations were made of inter-community aggression and female emigration, showing that social systems and mating systems are not necessarily the same thing. </s>
<s n="s7.13;p29.60">Stanford (1998) describes how the 1980s saw field sites in other parts of Africa offering research results, and showed differences in social groupings between locations. </s>
<s n="s8.13;p29.60">The female chimpanzees of the Tai Forest were found to be more sociable and bisexually-bonded than those at Kibale, Mahale, Bossou, Assirik and Gombe (Boesch, 1996). </s>
<s n="s9.13;p29.60">Suggestions have been made that female sociality may be connected to the availability of food resources, and indeed Wittig and Boesch (2003) found a linear dominance hierarchy among females when there was competition for food. </s>
<s n="s10.13;p29.60">It has been suggested that in order to forage for food during periods of scarcity "weak ties facilitate the individual dispersal of animals from the group" (Maryanski, 1987, p210). </s>
<s n="s11.13;p29.60">De Waal (2005) asserts that cooperation is typical among kin, for example mother and offspring, and among adult males regardless of kinship. </s>
<s n="s12.13;p29.60">In a study of the bonds between all the different age and sex categories of chimpanzees, Maryanski (1987) describes a fission-fusion society with weak ties among non-kin, apart from adult males who can form strong bonds, and strong ties between mothers and offspring and among siblings. </s>
<s n="s13.13;p29.60">The weakening of mother and daughter bonds as adolescence approaches is attributed to the likelihood of female chimpanzees to leave their natal group upon sexual maturity in order to join another group. </s>
</p>
<p n="p30.60">
<s n="s1.6;p30.60">More recent research on DNA analysis seems to suggest kin relationships are less important than previously thought (Mitanial. 2000, Goldberg and Wrangham, 1997) which contradicts earlier presumptions that chimpanzees selected associations with family members (Morinal. 1994). </s>
<s n="s2.6;p30.60">Research on female sociality and sexuality has sought to expose a 'myth' of the passive female, with claims that females are as capable of males with competition strategies (Wrangham, 1997, Small, 1993). </s>
<s n="s3.6;p30.60">When within-group competition for resources is strong female dominance hierarchies are found. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p30.60">When between-group competition is strong but within-group relationships are stable, an egalitarian dominance relationship is expected (Silk, 2002, p 85). </s>
<s n="s5.6;p30.60">In studies of other primates, expressions of dominance and position in a hierarchy have accounted for differences in behaviour between the sexes. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p30.60">For example, female macaques began showing more dominant behaviour after the removal of the alpha male and female (Hendricksal. 1975) and newly paired female rhesus monkeys showed affiliative behaviour while all newly paired males started fighting (Angermeiral. 1967). </s>
</p>
<p n="p31.60">
<s n="s1.4;p31.60">In conjunction with studies of chimpanzees in the wild, there has also been extensive observation of captive chimpanzees. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p31.60">Indeed, there are more chimpanzees in captivity than any other ape, largely due to the high number of the species in research laboratories in the United States (Brent, 2001). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p31.60">The current ongoing transfer of hundreds of these animals to sanctuaries gives added impetus to behavioural observations of captive chimpanzees that can inform caregivers of ways to improve the physical and psychological well-being of the animals (Brent, 2001). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p31.60">In addition to improving understanding and conditions for captive chimpanzees, such observations may also aid comprehension of natural behaviour. </s>
</p>
<p n="p32.60">
<s n="s1.2;p32.60">Hosey (2005, p 111) claims it is a "myth that worthwhile behavioural research is not possible in zoos because they are such an artificial environment. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p32.60">In reality not only is a substantial amount of good research undertaken on zoo-housed animals much of it has made important contributions towards developing and testing theory in behavioural biology". </s>
</p>
<p n="p33.60">
<s n="s1.13;p33.60">Students of captive chimpanzee behaviour recognise that the usual patterns of social behaviour cannot be entirely replicated. </s>
<s n="s2.13;p33.60">For example, as "individuals are usually unrelated, when adolescents would ordinarily migrate to another group. </s>
<s n="s3.13;p33.60">It is hard for animals to escape aggressiveness when they are unable to avoid each other, as they would do in the wild" (Poole, 1991, p 369). </s>
<s n="s4.13;p33.60">Therefore many social interactions may become magnified in a captive situation whereas in the wild avoidance would occur instead. </s>
<s n="s5.13;p33.60">In numerous studies of zoo chimpanzees, de Waal (2005, 1994, 1982) suggests that in the absence of the need to spend half their daily lives foraging for food, chimpanzee social lives become intensified and they devote much more time to socialising. </s>
<s n="s6.13;p33.60">He believes that among females, a subordination hierarchy rather than a dominance hierarchy exists, whereby females accept dominance rather than having to prove dominance and that different types of dominance manifest themselves in a chimp colony (Noe et al., 1980). </s>
<s n="s7.13;p33.60">In contrast to de Waal's (1982) assertion that dominance is relatively unimportant to female chimpanzees, Wrangham (1997) contends that in certain conditions females do exhibit displays of dominance. </s>
<s n="s8.13;p33.60">There have been incidences of female chimpanzees assuming the role of alpha animal in a group in captivity. </s>
<s n="s9.13;p33.60">De Waal (1982) recounts the narrative of Mama, a mature female who was the undisputed leader of a mixed group of chimpanzees at Arnhem Zoo for 18 months, until three adult males were introduced and the other members of the group rejected her leadership and followed one of the males. </s>
<s n="s10.13;p33.60">De Waal anecdotally reflects that dominance ceased to be important to Mama in terms of overall group leadership. </s>
<s n="s11.13;p33.60">In the laboratory setting Jensvoldal. (2005) place female chimpanzee Washoe at the top of the dominance hierarchy at the Chimpanzee and Human Communication Institute (CHCI) at Central Washington University. </s>
<s n="s12.13;p33.60">This hierarchical structure of dominance has remained stable for the last 10 years, and it is this stability which is thought to reduce group aggression, as "A stable hierarchy may reduce agonistic interactions due to the absence of attempts to displace the alpha chimpanzee" (Jensvoldal. 2005). </s>
<s n="s13.13;p33.60">So, the stability of a hierarchy may be an important element, along with individual personality differences, as well as the sex-ratio in the group. </s>

<head rend="underlined bold">How will this project address the identified problem and its causes? </head>
<p n="p34.60">
<s n="s1.4;p34.60">There are many different types of social groups found in zoos; large mixed-sex groups, small mixed-sex groups, large bachelor groups, all-female groups, mixed sex triads, mixed-sex dyads, single-sex dyads (Brent, 2001). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p34.60">By comparing similar sized mixed-sex groups and all-female groups, in similar environmental conditions with matching available space, it may be possible to observe different behaviour patterns or different activity levels that may be attributed to the sex composition of the group, rather than group size or environmental conditions. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p34.60">However, it must still be recognised that each zoo will inevitably have different husbandry practises and routines, but perhaps the study can help to share information between locations for future consideration. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p34.60">Of course, individual personalities of chimpanzees will also always play a part in their behaviour, but by comparing zoos with similar group sizes it is hoped the role of sex ratio will be more easily identified. </s>

<s n="s2.6;p36.60">Anecdotal reports from zoo keepers suggest visitors do not spend much time at enclosures with inactive animals, so the exhibits are unlikely to elicit much visitor appreciation and interest. </s>

<s n="s4.6;p36.60">If the hypothesis is not validated, and activity levels are normal when compared with those in other zoos and in the wild, that could be an important addition to the educational materials available about chimpanzees, as visitors would realise that the behaviour is not abnormal or an animal welfare issue. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p37.60">The chimpanzee group at Dudley Zoo consists of seven individuals. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p37.60">There are two mother/daughter dyads in the group, with both offspring seven years of age. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p37.60">Other adolescent females born to other adult females in the group have been removed in the last year because they were displaying aggressive behaviour, and so they could be added to breeding collections of chimpanzees. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p37.60">Anecdotal evidence from the chimpanzee caregivers suggests there is a hierarchy among the seven females, with one animal assuming the role of alpha. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p37.60">There is an indoor enclosure and permanent access to a large outdoor space. </s>
</p>
<p n="p38.60">
<s n="s1.11;p38.60">Twycross Zoo has a group of eight chimpanzees, with two adult males. </s>
<s n="s2.11;p38.60">One of the males has recently been returned to the group after being removed for aggressive behaviour. </s>
<s n="s3.11;p38.60">He has now been castrated, and is also receiving hormone supplements to reduce aggression. </s>
<s n="s4.11;p38.60">There is an indoor enclosure and constant access to an outdoor space equipped with climbing apparatus. </s>
<s n="s5.11;p38.60">Whipsnade Zoo has a breeding group of seven chimpanzees which includes two adult males. </s>
<s n="s6.11;p38.60">The chimps have a 0.6 hectare naturalistic outdoor enclosure with trees and a climbing frame, and large indoor quarters. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p38.60">Edinburgh Zoo has a group of eleven chimpanzees of mixed sexes; three adult males, two juvenile males and six females. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p38.60">Colchester Zoo has a mixed group of chimpanzees; three males and four females. </s>
<s n="s9.11;p38.60">In a review of party sizes in different communities of chimpanzees, Boesch (1996) found an average party size of 5.7 individuals (averages ranged from 4.0 to 8.3). </s>
<s n="s10.11;p38.60">The group sizes in my proposed study range from 7 to 11 (mean 8.6), therefore the average aligns with the top end of the average seen in the wild. </s>
<s n="s11.11;p38.60">It is hoped that by keeping the range small, the group size will be less of a factor than if comparisons were made with much larger groups. </s>

<p n="p39.60">
<s n="s1.2;p39.60">I will conduct a two-week pilot study at Dudley Zoo in December 2005 to practise using my data check-sheets and ethogram, and make refinements where necessary. </s>

<p n="p40.60">
<s n="s1.10;p40.60">I visited Dudley Zoo during October 2005 for a preliminary investigation of the site. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p40.60">The chimpanzees have access to the inside and outside areas all day by means of a cage tunnel. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p40.60">In order for observers to move from the observation area of the outside space to the indoor enclosure it is necessary to walk all the way around the building, which takes around three minutes. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p40.60">After four hours of observations, and after a conversation with the primary chimpanzee caregiver, it became clear that the outside space was rarely utilised and the chimpanzees preferred to remain indoors. </s>

<p n="p41.60">
<s n="s1.6;p41.60">In my opinion the chimpanzee exhibit at Dudley Zoo is not very well signposted, and it is also a long way and in the opposite direction from all the other zoo exhibits. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p41.60">These factors mean that, according to anecdotal evidence, there are comparatively fewer visitors to the chimpanzee area than to other parts of the zoo. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p41.60">I will make a note of the presence of human visitors in my observations. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p41.60">I will then be able to give overall numbers of zoo visitors, which may be useful information to the zoo management. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p41.60">I will also examine if chimpanzee activity increases, decreases or remains the same given the presence of onlookers. </s>

<s n="s2.3;p45.60">Having used ad libitum sampling during a short experimental study of chimpanzees, I concur with Bernstein (1991) that less noticeable behaviour and less conspicuous individuals tend to be missed out in the ad libitum observations. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p46.60">I plan to utilise a focal instantaneous sampling method as the main type of date collection. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p46.60">Having experimented with one-minute intervals and found the recordings to miss some observations, I will use 30 second intervals for 15 minutes at a time. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p46.60">This follows the recommendation of Martin and Bateson (1993, p90) who suggest "The shorter the sample interval, the more accurate instantaneous sampling is at estimating duration and the more closely it resembles continuous recording". </s>
</p>
<p n="p47.60">
<s n="s1.2;p47.60">As I am only planning to analyse female chimpanzee behaviour, it is important to bear in mind that more hours of observation time will be needed at Dudley Zoo for seven females than for smaller numbers of females at the other zoos. </s>

</p>
<p n="p48.60">
<s n="s1.1;p48.60">Altmann (1974, p213) suggests that focal animal sampling may exclude acts directed at the individual by others, so I also include in the ethogram a column to note the proximity to other individuals, approaches made to and by other individuals and the others involved in active behaviours such as grooming, playing and vocalisations. </s>

<p n="p52.60">
<s n="s1.2;p52.60">I plan to spread my observations across the whole day, given reports that chimpanzees are more active in the mornings and evenings, and less active in the middle of the day (Doran, 1997). </s>
