Subject to the rights of the these institutions in the BAWE corpus, and pursuant to the ESRC agreement, the BAWE corpus is available to researchers for research purposes PROVIDED THAT the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>1. The corpus files are not distributed in either their original form or in modified form.</p>
<p>2. The texts are used for research purposes only; they should not be reproduced in teaching materials.</p>
<p>3. The texts are not reproduced in full for a wider audience/readership, although researchers are free to quote short passages of text (up to 200 running words from any given text).</p>
<p>4. The BAWE corpus developers (contact: BAWE@warwick.ac.uk) are informed of all projects, dissertations, theses, presentations or publications arising from analysis of the corpus.</p>
<p>5. Researchers acknowledge their use of the corpus using the following form of words: "The data in this study come from the British Academic Written English (BAWE) corpus, which was developed at the Universities of Warwick, Reading and Oxford Brookes under the directorship of Hilary Nesi and Sheena Gardner (formerly of the Centre for Applied Linguistics [previously called CELTE], Warwick), Paul Thompson (Department of Applied Linguistics, Reading) and Paul Wickens (Westminster Institute of Education, Oxford Brookes), with funding from the ESRC (RES-000-23-0800)."</p>

<s n="s2.3;p5.18">The pistil and the anther have been fused forming a unit called column. </s>

<s n="s4.7;p6.18">First of all, it separates the male and the female parts of the flower in order to prevent self-pollination. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p6.18">Secondly, it is a gland, excreting a sticky substance on the back of any insect that comes into contact with it. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p6.18">As the insect tries to reach the base of the flower so as to take the nectar, its back rubs the rostellum, and a sticky substance is applied to it. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p6.18">As insect abandons the flower, the sticky substance comes in contact with pollinia, and the insect takes them to the next flower that visits, ensuring cross-pollination. </s>

<p rend="ordered" n="p11.18">
<s n="s1.2;p11.18">The second way of propagation is by division of the parent clump. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p11.18">The rhizome is cut and the two sections are two different plants. </s>

<p rend="ordered" n="p12.18">
<s n="s1.3;p12.18">The final method of propagation is mericloning. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p12.18">It is a method where in one year can be produced one million plants from pre plant. </s>
