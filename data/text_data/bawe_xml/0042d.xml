<s n="s1.4;p1.10">The most lasting legacy of Edward Said's <hi rend="italic">Orientalism</hi> (1978) - it has been argued- has been the "dislocation of the modern West", bringing down the "body of knowledge" that signified Orientalist writings about the East from their "Olympian heights".<ref target="BAWE_0042d-ftnote.001"/> Said's key argument revolved around the various representations of the Orient- focussing on <hi rend="italic">what</hi> the Orientalist wrote- not <hi rend="italic">how</hi>- about an 'other' which was essentially created by bypassing any dialogue between the different cultures, and operating within a very specific context of imperialism and hegemony.<ref target="BAWE_0042d-ftnote.002"/> Said's work had been preceded by considerable postcolonial writings, and it reinvigorated the debate subsequently in the 1980s with the creation of the <hi rend="italic">Subaltern Studies</hi> group of historians. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p1.10">After providing a glimpse of the major facets of Orientalism, and the responses it generated, this paper will argue that understandings and discussions of the East- focussing here particularly on India- continue to be influenced by the fundamental feature of Orientalism. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p1.10">The articulation of that feature is credited to Ronald Inden, who argued that Orientalism's deepest influence was denying "human agency" to the East, and providing universalising "models of how people ought to or must act." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0042d-ftnote.003"/>
<s n="s4.4;p1.10">Explicitly or inadvertently, both Orientalists as well as postcolonial critiques of all ideological spectres have failed to counter this highest level of hegemony. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p2.10">In many ways, the 'classical' Orientalism of the 19 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> century continued to influence much of the 20 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> century understandings of India, both in the writings of the Cambridge School, as well as their critiques who failed to move out of the broad generalisations thus created, and merely responded <hi rend="italic">to</hi> them. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p2.10">Firstly, Richard King has identified a broad distinguishing discourse, whereby society, science, rationality and masculinity are solely attributed to the Enlightenment. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p2.10">Conversely, religiosity, irrationality, mysticism and femininity are considered exclusive characteristics of the Orient.<ref target="BAWE_0042d-ftnote.004"/> Secondly, contemporary debates in linguistic studies as well as ancient history continue to pertain to the traditional Oriental discourse of "constructing the 'self' through the 'other'".<ref target="BAWE_0042d-ftnote.005"/> For example, Max Muller's search for Europe's "childhood" in the Sanskrit language and the Aryan race continues to be espoused, with the 'other' (in this case India) labelled "the eternal child", underlying its supposedly static nature.<ref target="BAWE_0042d-ftnote.006"/> Third, just as Arthur Balfour argued in 1910 that the Orient "...exists in a sense, as we know it", legacies of Hegel and James Mill's <hi rend="italic">History of India</hi> (1817) continue to survive, commenting on the disunity of the Orient.<ref target="BAWE_0042d-ftnote.007"/> This can be seen in Vincent Smith's writing- "In political institutions, no evolution took place. </s>

<ref target="BAWE_0042d-ftnote.008"/>
<s n="s5.6;p2.10">While colonial and postcolonial nationalist historiography has responded by referring to the 'golden age' of the Maurya and Gupta empires, the crucial question of whether a centralised Westphalian state is the minimum requirement to prevent colonisation has been largely unexplored. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p3.10">Said's work sparked off defensive reactions across academic disciplines to what was considered "Western tradition", and rebuttals by contemporary Orientalists like Dennis Porter and Bernard Lewis. </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0042d-ftnote.009"/>
<s n="s2.7;p3.10">However, the problem- as Gyan Prakash has pointed out- remains in what is taken to be the representation of the West, and invariably this is determined by Orientalism in the first place.<ref target="BAWE_0042d-ftnote.010"/> This digresses into a discourse that could be termed 'Occidentalism'. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p3.10">Such reverse essentialism was considered a part of Said's <hi rend="italic">Orientalism</hi> and criticised by James Clifford. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p3.10">Moreover, such discourses often deny the autonomy of the historical actors themselves. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p3.10">In <hi rend="italic">Orientalism</hi>, Said himself cited the writing of Flaubert, who spoke of the Egyptian woman who was always represented by her husband, a societal trait the writer took to be "typically Oriental".<ref target="BAWE_0042d-ftnote.011"/> An illustration is the debate around the <hi rend="italic">sati</hi> tradition (widow burning), which was uprooted during the 19 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> century by colonial officers and some members of the Hindu elite. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p3.10">While some contemporary writers sought justification of the tradition from Hindu texts, Orientalists denounced it as an example of 'Oriental despotism' and took it upon themselves to "civilise" the natives. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p3.10">What goes unnoticed in the debate- as Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak has argued- is the "silencing of the subaltern woman", whose history is presented by two contesting frameworks detached from her own agency. <ref target="BAWE_0042d-ftnote.012"/> </s>

<s n="s1.3;p4.10">To fill the void generated by Orientalist and nationalist historiography, a group of historians came together in the 1980s to establish <hi rend="italic">Subaltern Studies</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p4.10">The founding editor- Ranajit Guha- argued that their aim was to write the histories of the "demographic difference" between the total population of India and those groups they considered to be 'elite'.<ref target="BAWE_0042d-ftnote.013"/> While Jawaharlal Nehru had written his <hi rend="italic">Discovery of India</hi> (1946) largely to rescue Indian nationalism from being hijacked by narrow sectarian interests, <hi rend="italic">Subaltern Studies</hi> focussed instead on the heterogeneity of the 'mainstream', pointing out groups that had been essentialised not only by the Orientalists, but also by the nationalists. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p4.10">More fundamentally, the group- Partha Chatterjee in particular- has focussed on the "marginalisation of the 'other' forms of knowledge".<ref target="BAWE_0042d-ftnote.014"/> This tradition has influenced postmodernist and Marxist writers too, as works by Romila Thapar (1978) and Bernard Cohn (1987) on the social constructs of the Orientalists and nationalists vis-à-vis the "real" Orient of the subaltern groups demonstrates. <ref target="BAWE_0042d-ftnote.015"/> </s>

<s n="s1.3;p5.10">This approach, however, often fails to break the 'self-other' dichotomy between the elites and the marginalised groups, besides falling into the familiar trap of essentialising the supposedly non-essentialising characteristics- "appropriation of subalternity", according to Chatterjee- of these groups.<ref target="BAWE_0042d-ftnote.016"/> Moreover, the poststructuralist methodology has been criticised for "privileging particular informants", particularly when the localised writers were often writing in their own imperial and/or social contexts.<ref target="BAWE_0042d-ftnote.017"/> Gyan Prakash attempts to present a defence by arguing for the need to question the traditional labels such as "native" and "woman" (in the aforementioned <hi rend="italic">sati</hi> example), and explore new categories such as "native woman" with this relativist approach.<ref target="BAWE_0042d-ftnote.018"/> However, it is difficult to avoid the irony that much of the Orientalist writing- produced by colonial officers working in different parts of the empire- drew on precisely the <hi rend="italic">same</hi> technique- that of producing particularistic pictures of the localised Orient. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p5.10">Finally, as recent work in psychology has shown, individual actions are often subconsciously 'automated' by their external environment.<ref target="BAWE_0042d-ftnote.019"/> Therefore, the Foucauldian discourse Said drew on in <hi rend="italic">Orientalism</hi> acted on the localised agents of the subaltern groups in the same manner as it would have on the colonial writers, especially if these groups were in fact 'subaltern', thereby limiting their own power to shape the discourse. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p5.10">This reverts back to the problem many critics feel is inherent in <hi rend="italic">Orientalism</hi> where Said problematically espouses Gramsican counter-hegemony in a Foucauldian discourse.<ref target="BAWE_0042d-ftnote.020"/> </s>

<s n="s5.5;p7.10">Reactionary writing has been the most vociferous (especially in the 1990s with the ascent of the Hindutva movement) in arguing for "re-Indianising" the discourse to trace the "imagined community" of India, but it not only borrows crucial aspects of colonial Orientalism (such as the idea of a united and centralised India), but continuously finds- as Sudipta Kaviraj has argued- an 'other' to the Indian 'self' (Muslims, Europeans, etc.).<ref target="BAWE_0042d-ftnote.026"/> They are all, therefore, located within the straitjacket of Orientalism. </s>

<s n="s2.5;p9.10">I would even argue that narratives of non-European societies through a Western framework (without tacit acknowledgement of its thus limitation) "presents itself as a form of knowledge that is both different from, and superior to" the Orientals' knowledge about themselves- in essence, an Orientalist discourse.<ref target="BAWE_0042d-ftnote.029"/> Most writings pertaining to the Orient take Europe as the only "knowable" entity (since the structures of knowledge are European), viewing the Orient as merely an empirical study to be conducted through this skeleton.<ref target="BAWE_0042d-ftnote.030"/> It has also been argued that this entails that <hi rend="italic">all</hi> subsequent writings about the Orient (at least as long as Western political and intellectual hegemony does not recede) will continue to be classified as Orientalist, in one way or another. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p9.10">O'Hanlon and Washbrook question postcolonial critiques how the Oriental can refute Western discourses without understanding them, and how he can understand them without engaging them, and how, therefore, can he avoid being drawn into the discourse and avoid "totalising abstraction" and "endless relativism" of postmodernism at the same time.<ref target="BAWE_0042d-ftnote.031"/> Prakash offers a partial response, arguing that Oriental historiography must engage itself in a discourse "not determined" by Western conquest.<ref target="BAWE_0042d-ftnote.032"/> This seems inadequate, because Orientalist writings about India have often taken place <hi rend="italic">without</hi> an imperial context (in the case of French and German Orientalism). </s>
<s n="s4.5;p9.10">Perhaps what is required is a discourse not impacted upon by Western systems of knowledge- in essence, studying the Orient <hi rend="italic">on its own terms</hi>. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p9.10">For example, Indian political philosophy, despite being extremely rich, has been prevented from analysing Indian history on the grounds of "being tainted with theological assumptions".<ref target="BAWE_0042d-ftnote.033"/> </s>

<s n="s1.5;p10.10">Whether one looks at "the clash of civilisations" or the "axis of evil", essentialisations about the Orient are rife in contemporary Western- and consequently global- discourses. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p10.10">These not only reinforce the traditional Orientalist definitions of the 'self' (the West), it prompts the Orient to defend its own 'self' as defined by its 'other' (the West), thereby indirectly accepting the initial generalisation. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p10.10">Postcolonial Oriental historiography- in this case Indian- has failed to live up to Said's "fundamental human and intellectual obligation"- to reconcile a humanist method of writing history with the ideas of a Foucauldian discourse.<ref target="BAWE_0042d-ftnote.034"/> The alternative which I have proposed- creating an Oriental discourse based on its own value systems- is yet to be explored. </s>
