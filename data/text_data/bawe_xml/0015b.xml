<s n="s10.28;p7.16">He was vital to winning the war because he raised patriotism and was seen as a father figure to the nation. </s>
<s n="s11.28;p7.16">In the Great Patriotic War, socialism and communism were forgotten. </s>
<s n="s12.28;p7.16">The state emphasised that it was a fight for Russia as a nation. </s>

<ref target="BAWE_0015b-ftnote.015"/>
<s n="s15.28;p7.16">Stalin appealed backwards to the great Princes, such as Alexander Nevsky and great leaders, such as Lenin to gain a sense of patriotism in Russia. </s>

<ref target="BAWE_0015b-ftnote.016"/>
<s n="s18.28;p7.16">The cult of Stalin's personality may help to explain how the population survived the horrific invasion of Operation Barbarossa, then endured the hardships of war and come out victorious. </s>
<s n="s19.28;p7.16">Popular belief in Stalin would have made people work harder, more bravely and obey orders. </s>
<s n="s20.28;p7.16">Support for Stalin is believed to have been greater amongst the armed forces over the civilians. </s>
<s n="s21.28;p7.16">Propaganda in the army was more intense. </s>
<s n="s22.28;p7.16">Pictures of Stalin could be seen in army camps. </s>
<s n="s23.28;p7.16">However, naturally there were civilians and soldiers who remained hostile to Stalin and blamed him for the war. </s>
<s n="s24.28;p7.16">Another way the government tried to raise morale and nationalism was through the reintroduction of the Orthodox Church. </s>
<s n="s25.28;p7.16">Religion provided a sense of national pride. </s>
<s n="s26.28;p7.16">This is illustrated in <hi rend="italic">The People's War</hi>, which talks about an SD's<ref target="BAWE_0015b-ftnote.017"/> description of a Minsk clergyman as 'the best propagandist for the German issue." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0015b-ftnote.018"/>
<s n="s27.28;p7.16">However, this clergyman changed to support Stalin when Stalin altered his strategy toward the church, meaning support for the Soviet Union was dramatically raised when linked with the church. </s>
