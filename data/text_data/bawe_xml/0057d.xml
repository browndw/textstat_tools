<s n="s2.6;p5.7">Removing three outliers (in condition 10 and 16) generated additional significant effects of sex F(1,106) = 7.32; p&lt;.008, and an interaction effect of age and group F(1,106) = 6.709; p&lt;.011. </s>

<p n="p6.7">
<s n="s1.6;p6.7">The present study aimed to investigate the effect, on attitude towards mobile phones, off an advert identifying mobile phones as a cause of traffic accidents. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p6.7">It is surprising to find that the advert seems to have produced significantly more positive attitudes overall in almost all the control groups. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p6.7">These scores may be the result of an inversed Hawthorne effect; the purpose of the advert cannot have escaped anyone in the intervention groups, arguably to the extent that the obviousness of the attempt at psychological manipulation may have annoyed several participants. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p6.7">This may have caused them to give more positive answers. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p6.7">It also seems that female participants were more prone to such acts of protest. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p6.7">To exclude possible effects of protest, and allow for any generalizations outside of the experimental setting, future studies should perhaps make use of adverts and questionnaires addressing a variety of topics or in other ways try to conceal the purpose of the study<ref target="BAWE_0057d-ftnote.001"/>. </s>

<p n="pn1.1">
<s n="s1.2;pn1.1">(Not knowing what the fictional advert looked like I can't know, but) it is possible that the experienced appeal of the mobile phones and mobile phone users (perhaps even the cars) featured in the advert had an effect worth mentioning on the attitudes of the participants. </s>
<s n="s2.2;pn1.1">Future studies should make sure the articles and persons in the advert are as neutral as possible. </s>
</p>
</note>
<p n="p7.7">
<s n="s1.5;p7.7">Another weakness in this study was the absence of any equivalent treatment in the control groups, such as a neutral advert involving mobile phones and traffic safety. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p7.7">Showing the control groups the advert after they completed the questionnaire did not contribute to the study. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p7.7">As mentioned, the data did violate some of the assumptions of the model. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p7.7">A larger sample would have been advisable. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p7.7">Before these errors have been corrected and implemented in a new study, no conclusions can be drawn about the effects of the advert. </s>
