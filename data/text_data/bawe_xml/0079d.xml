<p n="p1.98">
<s n="s1.3;p1.98">The phenomenon of Currency Substitution (CS) has a long tradition in economic literature <hi rend="sup">1</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p1.98">The term refers to a situation where a foreign currency is utilized as a medium of exchange by agents in a particular economy (Calvo and VÃ©gh 1996, p.153). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p1.98">This phenomenon is particularly important when the domestic currency is not fully credible, probably associated with a lack of confidence in the monetary policies applied in the country. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.98">
<s n="s1.2;p2.98">If CS holds, agents will swap the domestic for foreign currency as the domestic exchange rate tends to depreciate. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p2.98">This approach has been utilized in the empirical literature on CS, where a demand for money function is augmented with the introduction of the exchange rate (Arango and Nadiri, 1981). </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.98">
<s n="s1.3;p3.98">The econometric testing of CS with a vector error correction (VEC) model has been applied in different developing countries with diverse results. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p3.98">For instance, Pozo and Wheeler (2000) did not find evidence of CS in Singapore against the US dollar. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p3.98">On the other hand, Bahmani-Oskooee and Techaratanachai (2001) and Prockal. (2003) found evidence of CS in Thailand and Latin-America,<hi rend="sup">2</hi> respectively, also against the US dollar. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.98">
<s n="s1.2;p4.98">The objective of this paper is to test the CS phenomenon in Argentina with a VEC model utilizing a simple open-economy money demand function. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p4.98">As usual in the literature on VEC models, the technique developed in Johansen (1988) and Johansen and Juselius (1990) to determine the cointegration relations is applied. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.98">
<s n="s1.2;p5.98">As non-normalities in the residuals of the first vector autoregressive (VAR) formulation were found, the nonparametric test proposed by Bierens (1997) is also introduced. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p5.98">Both approaches confirmed the existence of one long-run relation in the demand for money. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.98">
<s n="s1.1;p6.98">Finally, the results obtained through the estimation of the cointegration vector suggest the absence of the CS phenomenon in Argentina from 1991:04 to 2003:12. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.98">
<s n="s1.6;p7.98">The paper is organized as follows. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p7.98">Section I introduces the data. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p7.98">Section II discusses the demand for money equation. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p7.98">Section III explains the VEC formulation and the cointegration analysis. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p7.98">Section IV briefly describes an extension to analyse the model's short-run dynamics. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p8.98">After the implementation of the Convertibility Plan in April 1991 <hi rend="sup">3</hi>, real cash balances holdings in Argentina increased markedly. </s>

<s n="s2.4;p9.98">I constructed a pseudo-velocity variable, replacing the corresponding level of prices with the nominal effective exchange rate (See figure 2). </s>
