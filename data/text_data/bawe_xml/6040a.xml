<s n="s2.5;p1.9">It was a society in which the use of slaves was an everyday occurrence and it can be said that the economy and stability of the society relied on the use of slaves. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p1.9">Slaves in Athens, like women in Athens, were not classed as citizens and it can be asserted that they were not treated as human beings. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p1.9">There are many aspects of slavery that shed light on how slaves were treated. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p1.9">These are the amount of slaves in Athens, how the slavery was justified, whether the Athenians were cruel to their slaves, whether the slaves were considered to be less human than the free people of Athens and whether the comic characterisations of the treatment of slaves in the plays of Aristophanes are at all true. </s>

<p n="p2.9">
<s n="s1.4;p2.9">As fifth century Athens was a slave society we can safely say that there was a large number of slaves in Athens. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p2.9">There were in fact such a large number of slaves that it can be said that the Greeks could not imagine life without any slaves.<ref target="BAWE_6040a-ftnote.001"/> The speech Lysias 24 which is written on behalf of a cripple suggests that even poor Athenians would have looked to own slaves and would have seen them as an investment in terms of income.<ref target="BAWE_6040a-ftnote.002"/> When Aristotle presents his argument in support of slavery he mentions the "master and slave" as natural elements within the household.<ref target="BAWE_6040a-ftnote.003"/> This suggests that slavery was thought of as an essential and ordinary element in the Athenian household. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p2.9">There were different kinds of slaves in Athens, and therefore different slaves would have had different experiences with different masters and types of work. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p2.9">The public slaves and the skilled craftsmen may have experienced a more pleasant life compared to that of the miners who were often worked to death in appalling conditions, and the domestics slaves may have been able to forge relationships with their masters while agricultural slaves faced had work on the fields.<ref target="BAWE_6040a-ftnote.004"/> </s>

<s n="s2.2;p3.9">He commented on how people were born, stating that some people were born to "rule or be ruled", and therefore slavery was just and an advantage for the slave.<ref target="BAWE_6040a-ftnote.007"/> There are many references to slaves as being an "animate piece of property" and therefore they are meant to be owned and follow the commands of their owners.<ref target="BAWE_6040a-ftnote.008"/> Many Greeks saw slaves as being one of the "essential requirements of life" and thus made for slavery.<ref target="BAWE_6040a-ftnote.009"/> The Pseudo-Aristotelian mentions three things that slaves are meant for as being "work, punishment and food", this presents the slave as being designed for slavery and therefore by being a slave is fulfilling some sort of life purpose.<ref target="BAWE_6040a-ftnote.010"/> Many slave owners believed they were justified in owning slaves because they were born into slave families or they were won in wars which were fought fairly.<ref target="BAWE_6040a-ftnote.011"/> </s>

<s n="s4.4;p4.9">In the speech Lysias 4, a man "proposed that his own slaves should be interrogated under torture", this is showing a disregard for the condition of the slave as tortured slaves could be returned to their owners less able than before.<ref target="BAWE_6040a-ftnote.017"/> </s>

<s n="s4.6;p5.9">In Demosthenes 21, it states "if anyone humiliates anyone, whether they are free or slave, or commits any illegal act against any of these, let any Athenian who has the right to do so and wishes submit their names to the Thesmothetai".<ref target="BAWE_6040a-ftnote.019"/> Although slaves are protected in these ways according to the law, they themselves cannot file a lawsuit and so they rely on others who are free. </s>

<s n="s6.6;p5.9">Other laws such as that stating "persons other than the slaves owner is not allowed to strike him" do not completely protect slaves, first the owner can still beat the slave and it will only protect the slave if the owner takes action when others beat the slave.<ref target="BAWE_6040a-ftnote.020"/> </s>

<s n="s3.4;p7.9">There were many ways in which slaves were dehumanised. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p7.9">They are referred to as 'property' and compared to 'wild beasts', suggesting that they are a lower life form than the free men.<ref target="BAWE_6040a-ftnote.024"/> Slaves were also prevented from doing what is natural such as forming relationships and having children, this put them lower than the rest of society.<ref target="BAWE_6040a-ftnote.025"/> Slaves were also not allowed to give evidence at a lawsuit unless it was extracted while under torture, and many dehumanising devices were used such as referring to adult male slaves a 'boy'.<ref target="BAWE_6040a-ftnote.026"/> However, some Athenians would have seen slaves as human as shown in Xenophon "Slaves have no less need of something good to hope for than do free men".<ref target="BAWE_6040a-ftnote.027"/> This shows an acknowledge meant that slaves have the same hopes as all other people rather than not being able to think like suggested by others such as Aristotle when he brands slaves as incapable of all independent reasoning.<ref target="BAWE_6040a-ftnote.028"/> I believe that Demosthenes sums up the reality for slaves when he states that "the greatest difference between the slave and the free man is that the former is answerable with his body for all offences".<ref target="BAWE_6040a-ftnote.029"/> </s>
