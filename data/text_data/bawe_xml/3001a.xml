<s n="s1.8;p13.13">In conclusion, it seems both Eliot and Dickens found the facets of tragedy ideal for exploring the topics that were the cause of the doubt and fear endemic to Victorian society. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p13.13">They used their novels as vehicles to teach and where possible provide comfort through comedy. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p13.13">They were able to convey their realist views on social class, gender relations and education, whilst purging their "yearning for an earlier society that was supposed to be idyllically integrated and morally pristine." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3001a-ftnote.084"/>
<s n="s4.8;p13.13">Indeed, Eliot was concerned with exploring the relationship of the past to the present. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p13.13">She saw "tragedy as the universal experience,"<ref target="BAWE_3001a-ftnote.085"/> so she opted for the traditional catharsis, or purging of emotion that Maggie and Tom's death delivers to the reader. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p13.13">In an ironic twist Eliot destroys her champion for the liberated female, perhaps too afraid to openly challenge Victorian morality and keen to restore the stability her society craved. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p13.13">Sandra Gilbert feels "Eliot becomes entangled in contradictions that she can only resolve through acts of vengeance against her own characters." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3001a-ftnote.086"/>
<s n="s8.8;p13.13">Alternatively, Dickens opted for a modernist denouement that lacked finality but paved the way for a new version of tragedy, preferring to leave his readers is an emotional stasis and in doing so reserving and concealing his final conclusions on social reality. </s>
