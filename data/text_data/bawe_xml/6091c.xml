<s n="s1.8;p5.24">In 1897, a British physicist named J.J. Thomson was exploring how cathode rays were affected by passing between electrically charged plates. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p5.24">He discovered that the rays were attracted to the positively charged plate. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p5.24">Thomson also indirectly calculated the charge/mass ratio and found that it was over 1000 times smaller than that of an atom! </s>
<s n="s4.8;p5.24">He concluded that the cathode rays must be lots of tiny particles of matter far smaller the atoms with a negative charge. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p5.24">These would later become known as electrons. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p5.24">There was a problem; atoms are neutral, which led to the first model of the atom. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p5.24">Thomson imagined the atom as a positive pudding with negative plums spread evenly inside it. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p5.24">This would later be found to be incorrect. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.24">
<s n="s1.3;p6.24">In 1898, a previous associate of Thomson began research into radioactivity, this was a New Zealander called Ernest Rutherford. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p6.24">Rutherford found two types of radiation in radioactive decay, he named these Alpha)andBeta),and then later a third was found and namedGamma). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p6.24">Rutherford soon found Beta radiation to be electrons; alpha radiation was something rather different, it has a mass four times that of hydrogen and a charge double that of the electron but positive. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.24">
<s n="s1.6;p7.24">In 1909 colleagues of Rutherford, Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden carried out an experiment where a beam of alpha particles was directed at a thin metal foil. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p7.24">The results from this saw most of the electrons passing through the foil but they were scattered. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p7.24">But some of the particles were reflected back! </s>
<s n="s4.6;p7.24">From this Rutherford concluded that, if most of the particles were passing through the foil then the 'plum pudding' model must be wrong. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p7.24">As the Alpha particles were moving with great speed they could brush past the electrons passing through. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p7.24">The particles that got reflected must meet a tiny concentrated positive centre, as the alpha particles are too positive they are repelled back. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.24">
<s n="s1.5;p8.24">In 1911, Rutherford produced a new model of the atom. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p8.24">However there was an immediate problem with Rutherford's model. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p8.24">If the negative charge was on the outside why didn't it attract towards the nucleus and hence collapse, emitting light in the process. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p8.24">This was not the case. </s>

<p n="p9.24">
<s n="s1.6;p9.24">Around the same time a German scientist, Max Plank, was investigating the unification of electrodynamics and thermodynamics, in particular he was studying blackbody radiation<ref target="BAWE_6091c-ftnote.002"/>, there were already two known equations to explain two parts of the radiation, but they were independent of each other. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p9.24">Plank accidentally, using a bit of mathematical trick, joined the two equations, but now the equation had no physical basis. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p9.24">Later Plank noticed that the equation could make sense if he used Boltzmann's idea that the second law of thermodynamics<ref target="BAWE_6091c-ftnote.003"/> was based on a statistical probability. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p9.24">However, Plank had been brought up on and believed strongly in classical determinism, Boltzmann's probability model was far from this and so he shunned the idea, around this time he also realised he had made a mistake in his working. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p9.24">As a result he was left with excess bits of energy that had to be explained. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p9.24">He interpreted this idea; that electric oscillators in the atom could only absorb and emit discrete packets of energy of certain sizes later called 'quanta' and was given by the equation; </s>

<p n="p18.24">
<s n="s1.1;p18.24">The Bohr model allowed for more spectral lines than were observed in the spectra of atoms, and so Bohr added rules forbidding certain quantum jumps between levels, again without any real justification, this is generally seen as poor scientific practice, but for the time being it seemed to work. </s>
