<head rend="underlined bold">Method:</head>
<p n="p3.16">
<s n="s1.7;p3.16">First of all, a graphic stage was created by pressing the "New graphic stage" button on the standard toolbar in the CES window, "Fresh water" was selected from attributes list box on the x-axis tab and "Ductility" was selected on the y-axis tab. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p3.16">A graph was shown to indicate the ductility of materials against the corrosion resistance in fresh water. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p3.16">"Box selection" button on the Project toolbar was pressed afterwards for selecting materials within a property range. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p3.16">The mouse was clicked near the point (Very good, 0.2), the button was held down and the cursor was drag near to the point (Very good, 9.3(Max.)). </s>
<s n="s5.7;p3.16">The limits were refined by opening "Stage properties" window in the "Project" menu and the exact value was entered in the "Selection" tab. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p3.16">Total number of 155 different materials met the specification in this stage. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p3.16">(Figure 1.1) Failed materials were hidden by pressing "Hide failed record" box in "Stage properties" window. </s>

<p n="p4.16">
<s n="s1.5;p4.16">Secondly, another graphic stage was created in the same method as the one above. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p4.16">But "Maximum service temperature" and "Thermal conductivity" were selected on the x-axis and y-axis tab respectively. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p4.16">A graph (Figure 1.2) was shown again to indicate the maximum service temperature against the thermal conductivity for different materials. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p4.16">Again, "Box selection" button was pressed and limits were refined to 423K to 3800K (Max.) on the x-axis and refined to 200W/m.K to 422W/m.K (Max.) on the y-axis, using the same method as stage one. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p4.16">At the end, 21 different materials met the specification in this stage. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.16">

<head rend="underlined bold">Evaluation:</head>
<p n="p6.16">
<s n="s1.5;p6.16">In fact some characteristics were also important and might influence the choice, therefore a careful consideration was needed, e.g. lower price was important in large number of manufacturing processes, higher endurance limit was helpful for long-term usage and the relevant replacement cost could be minimized, lower specific heat lowered the amount of heat required to heat up the fluid. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p6.16">Although "Silver, Commercial Purity" (Figure 1.6) was the best material after intersection, it was too expensive. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p6.16">Both "Brass" (Figure 1.7) and "High Conductivity Copper" (Figure 1.8) had a lower price and a similar specific heat, "High Conductivity Copper" had a higher endurance limit and "Higher Conductivity Copper" had a higher thermal conductivity. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p6.16">But the heat exchanger tubes with high thermal conductivity were more important than one with a high endurance limit. </s>
