<p n="p3.68">
<s n="s1.4;p3.68">Rodrigo de Rato, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, is optimistic about the economic future of Latin America. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p3.68">He says, "If economic growth can be maintained at its present level of between 4 and 5 percent over the next ten years, real per capita income in 2015 will be 40 percent higher than it is today ... a significant change from the relative stagnation of the last 25 years. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p4.68">Latin America must also show economic flexibility in responding to the rise of China as a world player. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p4.68">China competes with Latin America in terms of textiles and labour-intensive manufactured products, but China's constant struggle to feed itself means it is also a large importer of commodities from Latin America. </s>

<p n="p31.68">
