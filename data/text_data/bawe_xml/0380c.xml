<s n="s1.6;p1.12">There was no centralised plan and little regulation in the eighteenth century, so asylums were extremely diverse. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p1.12">For example, many asylums relied on chains and physical coercion, but Nathaniel Cotton of St. Albans asylum managed his patients with no restraints.<ref target="BAWE_0380c-ftnote.001"/> Therefore it is difficult to give a uniform picture for private asylums, many were scandalous, whereas others show signs of therapeutic innovation, such as Spring Vale. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p1.12">However, Scull argues that in private asylums management methods for the insane remained basic. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p1.12">He says that the claim of humanitarianism, science and government inspection creating 'the great nineteenth-century movement for a more humane and intelligent treatment of the insane'<ref target="BAWE_0380c-ftnote.002"/> was grossly misleading. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p1.12">However, again, this is not to say to say individual madhouses made no effort to secure their inmates wellbeing, rather that private asylums should be regarded not as a general phenomenon but individual. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p1.12">This essay will address private asylums in the light of Porter's description. </s>

<s n="s1.9;p2.12">Scandal came in numerous forms, for example, false confinement and ill-treatment of patients. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p2.12">Private asylums could be a place to 'get rid of' inconvenient relatives or to get inheritance, in this way false confinement could be seen as a way in which private asylums were running sores of scandal. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p2.12">For example, Foyster's account indicates that mad-doctors like Battie and Monro may have been assistants in errant husbands who sought control of their unruly wives; this could be linked to the money-making proprietor to be mentioned shortly and his wiliness to take paying patients.<ref target="BAWE_0380c-ftnote.003"/> However, many of these cases were dubious and difficult to prove. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p2.12">The case of Coates the Elder and his wife in 1772 is one of the worst instances of abuse in a private madhouse. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p2.12">The case was over the illegal confinement of Mrs Ewbank and Mrs Mills at the request of their abusive husbands and then they were verbally and physically abused in the asylum, for example being told all their hair would cut off.<ref target="BAWE_0380c-ftnote.004"/> However, there is much exaggeration in these accounts for effect.<ref target="BAWE_0380c-ftnote.005"/> There was also much fictional writing on madhouses, which fed their public reputation. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p2.12">However, this is not to say all cases should be dismissed as exaggerated. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p2.12">For example, a pauper at the Dunston Lodge had his two upper incisor teeth removed and was secluded after he bit the proprietor. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p2.12">The proprietor was found guilty of cruelty and his licence was prohibited by the Commissioners in Lunacy. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p2.12">These cases may show abuse, but also the thoroughness of judicial investigations to ensure appropriate treatment for patient's recovery. </s>

<ref target="BAWE_0380c-ftnote.007"/>
<s n="s3.8;p3.12">He provided indication that his private asylum was not a medical institution because he was chained every night regardless of his behaviour, which would suggest he was not being properly monitored and was merely seen as a nuisance or a danger. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p3.12">Chaining patients to beds was supposed to have some therapeutic intent, but overuse could be punitive, for example solitary confinement. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p3.12">However, biased and egotistical he is, for example referring to himself as Alexander the Corrector, his piece does illustrate a lack of moral management and that threats were used instead. </s>

<s n="s4.5;p4.12">However, Milford agreed, 'the advocates for the extinction of foreign slavery will do well to look at home- to the slavery of whites, in private mad-houses, where they are worse treated than negroes - the maniacs are there abused as an inferior cast of beings, as a degraded and malignant race and they are made so by cruel treatment." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0380c-ftnote.010"/>
<s n="s5.5;p4.12">Similarly, Conolly argues that patients from lower and middle classes were particularly suffering from maltreatment earlier in the century, because proprietors wanted to attract high paying patients so neglected those paid for by the parish.<ref target="BAWE_0380c-ftnote.011"/> </s>

<s n="s1.9;p7.12">Analogously, until the second half of the nineteenth century, staff received no professional training, therefore it is difficult to see how uniformly private madhouses can be seen as sites of innovation. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p7.12">The relationship between keeper and patient was unequal, with the keeper having considerable power, which in Browne's 'What Asylums Were, Are, and Ought to Be'<ref target="BAWE_0380c-ftnote.018"/> is not what should occur. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p7.12">Patients should be explained their treatment, not treated with physical restraint unnecessarily. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p7.12">Campbell<ref target="BAWE_0380c-ftnote.019"/>, reported that between 1847 and 1858, forty-eight male attendants and twenty female 'nurses' were dismissed for cruelty from private madhouses.<ref target="BAWE_0380c-ftnote.020"/> In 1850, an anomalous letter was written referring to 'ignorant, idle and ferocious keepers, acting without conscience or control." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0380c-ftnote.021"/>
<s n="s5.9;p7.12">For an asylum to be a site of innovation, the staff would have to be motivated and specialised. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p7.12">D.J Mellett argues that the alleged functions of the attendants and their practical capabilities held huge discrepancies, because of poor pay, low status and high expectations, such as the expectation of being available day and night, of what keepers should contribute to care of insane. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p7.12">Night staff were not employed until the 1840s.<ref target="BAWE_0380c-ftnote.022"/> Scull argues that attendants were from the dregs of society and that few people had experience in the field, which would help for therapeutic innovation. </s>

<s n="s1.14;p10.12">However, in the metropolis, many poor and pauper lunatics went to private madhouses. </s>

<s n="s3.14;p10.12">If they were completely scandalous why would families sent their relatives there at cost? </s>
<s n="s4.14;p10.12">However, the scope for maltreatment in private asylums could be considered to be greater than public because they were less in the public eye, and could not be visited in the same way. </s>
<s n="s5.14;p10.12">Therefore evidence of scandal only surfaced if complaints were made. </s>
<s n="s6.14;p10.12">This does also mean that the majority of evidence collected is going to be extreme and negative. </s>
<s n="s7.14;p10.12">However, there is a letter of thanks by John Ryalnd to the Strafford Asylum, which redresses the balance.<ref target="BAWE_0380c-ftnote.030"/> Therefore, it is important to discuss the private asylum compared to the alternatives. </s>
<s n="s8.14;p10.12">Surely, being in a private madhouse had less scandal than a workhouse. </s>
<s n="s9.14;p10.12">'Workhouse was ill-suited to provide a secure safe-keeping for those who might pose a threat to life or property." </s>

<s n="s10.14;p10.12">The local jail was another alternative for violent madmen, complaints about their presence came from jailers and prisoners.<ref target="BAWE_0380c-ftnote.032"/> Alternatively, patients could be cared for in the home. </s>
<s n="s11.14;p10.12">However, patients could be unmanageable, with a tendency to wonder or cause local disturbances.<ref target="BAWE_0380c-ftnote.033"/> They were also a burden on the families' income and could have brought shame on the family. </s>
<s n="s12.14;p10.12">There would be little chance of therapeutic innovation at home, and whether they were sites of abuse would depend on individual families. </s>
<s n="s13.14;p10.12">County asylums were thought to be places where 'many patients were simply left to rot." </s>

<s n="s1.9;p11.12">Changes occurred for private madhouses from the eighteenth to nineteenth century. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p11.12">Legislation was slowly passed, such as the 1774 Regulation of Madhouses Act, attempting to regulate private madhouses. </s>

<s n="s5.9;p11.12">The Madhouse Act and Lunatic Acts improved on this and did introduce medical attendants into visitations. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p11.12">Also the 1815 report on private asylums highlighted neglect of appropriate provisions for pauper lunatics. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p11.12">This pushed for more public money being spent on county asylums. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p11.12">By decreasing the number of pauper admissions in private asylums, the risk of abuse was minimised because there was less chance of neglect and understaffing. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p11.12">However, change was slow and not uniform, but by the nineteenth century private asylums were considered less scandalous than the eighteenth century. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p12.12">Overall, each asylum was unique and although some asylums, like Spring Vale showed innovations, these were by no means uniform. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p12.12">Pauper inmates certainly received worse treatment in private asylums, but there was scandal of false confinement and poor conditions for all patients. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p12.12">'Although the rich could buy opulent accommodation, greater attention and more eminent psychiatrists for their crazy relatives, but not more cures." </s>

<s n="s4.6;p12.12">However, by buying better accommodation it could not harm their treatment. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p12.12">Therapeutic innovations could include reading and working, which was more readily available in some private madhouses. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p12.12">Although changes were made in the nineteenth century, they were slow and as stated throughout the essay there is no uniform picture, therefore Porter's statement seems fair. </s>
