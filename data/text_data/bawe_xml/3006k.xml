<s n="s2.7;p1.33">Probably the most key period in the development of biblical interpretation was that of the sixteenth-century European Reformation. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p1.33">Stimulated by the works of Erasmus and Christian Humanism, the Reformation "sought reform of the universal Catholic Church"<ref target="BAWE_3006k-ftnote.001"/>, and essentially transformed Christianity. </s>

<s n="s5.7;p1.33">One of the most notable is King Henry VIII who abused the fractious state of Christianity during the Reformation, manipulating scripture in order to enhance his power. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p1.33">In 1531 the convocation of England accepted Henry VIII as Head of the Church in England 'as far as the law of God allows' enabling the King to grant his own right to divorce. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p1.33">This in turn led to the dissolution of the monasteries which not only suppressed some of the most vociferous opponents of Henry's most recent legislation, but resulted in the crown making great financial profit. </s>

<quote lang="English">In Gilead, with the exception of the Salvagings, even the most appalling practices are attributed biblical justification. Daniels and Bowen propose that dystopian societies "advocate self and other loathing." Indeed, in both <hi rend="italic">The Handmaid's Tale</hi> and <hi rend="italic"> Nineteen Eighty-Four</hi> "friendships are forbidden and spying is encouraged." Moreover, what is perhaps more shocking in Atwood's novel is the way in which violence and hatred is often inflicted on women by women. Early on in the novel, Offred describes her relationship with Ofglen: "The truth is that she is my spy, as I am hers." <ref target="BAWE_3006k-ftnote.051"/> The consequences of "women disunited" are a key focus point in feminist research. In 1988 de Beauvoir described "circumstances in which the disunity of women promoted the reproduction of an unequal social structure in which woman represented only negative aspects of human nature." <ref target="BAWE_3006k-ftnote.052"/> This, I think can be seen as an accurate description of the situation in Gilead, where there is no female role that is wholly positive. The Handmaids in particular are viewed negatively by their mistresses, and there is little to protect them from the bitterness provoked by jealousy. "They can hit us", Offred says referring to the Commanders' Wives, "there's Scriptural precedent." <ref target="BAWE_3006k-ftnote.053"/>
