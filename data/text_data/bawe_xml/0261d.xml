<s n="s6.9;p1.16">The events in Salem were unique as they engulfed the entire community and the surrounding towns. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p1.16">The origins of this extraordinary situation are highly complex as they revolve around the conservative theology of Puritans, the internal pressures of society and external stimuli. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p1.16">Salem developed a self-momentum for witch hunting of its own that was not present in any other Puritan community. </s>

<p n="p6.16">
<s n="s1.1;p6.16">Mary Beth Norton, the author of <hi rend="italic">In the Devil's snare,</hi> acknowledges the importance of these raids, as the Indian had been associated in the New England Puritan mind as the "black man" or Devil, so the attacks were an allegory of Satan attempting to destroy the Puritan society. </s>

<s n="s4.6;p8.16">The rise of a merchant class amongst the Townsmen was inevitable but the farmers wanted to resist this pressure of commercial capitalism and social style, which they regarded as sinful. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p8.16">The lack of Salem's autonomy "exposed and intensified certain destructive patterns of political behaviour" and the unresolvement of questions regarding legislature and authority led to the "Bayley Dispute"<ref target="BAWE_0261d-ftnote.009"/>. </s>

<s n="s4.10;p10.16">The shifting locus of control in village passed from the Porter's to the Putnam's, but the intermarriage relationships convoluted the situation. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p10.16">Samuel Parris' arrival resulted in another battle between himself and members of the congregation, as he was an ultra orthodox Puritan who used the Church as a podium to present his own resentments and obsessions. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p10.16">This crisis played a considerable role in 1692 as the Putnam's became the main prosecutors of the witches and the families of the anti-Parris faction, such as the Proctors, Nurses and Porters, were frequently accused of witchcraft. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p10.16">The Putnam's power was declining due to the familial changes of heritage and so the pursuit for witches "served as a psychic weapon to restore their prestige." </s>
