<s n="s1.3;p21.29">G2 is a graph of longitudinal force vs. slip ratio. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p21.29">When the slip ratio is &lt;0.03 then the results are linear. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p21.29">At values >0.03 then the results are again linear but with a reduced gradient. </s>
</p>
<p n="p22.29">
<s n="s1.4;p22.29">G3 shows a linear model with three different values of cornering stiffness. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p22.29">The model is represented by the equation F <hi rend="sub">y</hi> = C + C <hi rend="sub">p</hi> where is the slip angle and C is the cornering stiffness. 'a' represents the line when C = 1005Ndeg <hi rend="sup"> - 1</hi> and is the linear model which applies to the particular data used. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p22.29">The value of 1005Ndeg <hi rend="sup">-1</hi> is the gradient of the graph up to 2.5 deg. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p22.29">Different values for cornering stiffness were then modelled. 'b' represents 1200Ndeg <hi rend="sup"> - 1</hi> and 'c' represents 800Ndeg <hi rend="sup"> - 1</hi>. </s>
</p>
<p n="p23.29">
<s n="s1.2;p23.29">The model itself is certainly accurate up to the 2deg point, however between 2 and 2.5deg it is hard to tell, as there are no results in this boundary. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p23.29">For values of slip angle >2.5 then this model is obviously inaccurate. </s>
</p>
<p n="p24.29">
<s n="s1.5;p24.29">G4 represents lateral force vs. slip angle using a non-linear model. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p24.29">It is effective for large slip angle values and is also reasonably good at estimating small angle values. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p24.29">However it has zero force at zero slip angle which is inaccurate as proved by the results. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p24.29">At small angles this model will give about 20% error. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p24.29">It curves off exponentially. </s>

<p n="p25.29">
<s n="s1.5;p25.29">G5 represents longitudinal force vs. slip ratio. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p25.29">It is another linear model, which applies only to small slip ratios &lt;0.03. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p25.29">It is modelled by the equation F <hi rend="sub">x</hi> = C <hi rend="sub">s</hi>s + C <hi rend="sub">q</hi> where C <hi rend="sub">s</hi> = 121950N is the longitudinal stiffness and the best fit gradient &lt;0.03 slip ratio. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p25.29">This is represented by line 'd'. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p25.29">Line 'e' represents Cs = 150000N and line 'f' represents Cs = 90000N. This model is very inaccurate for estimating longitudinal force for values of slip ratio above 0.03. </s>
</p>
<p n="p26.29">
<s n="s1.5;p26.29">G6 represents longitudinal force vs. slip ratio in a non-linear model. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p26.29">This is very useful for larger values of slip ratio but is also quite accurate for smaller values. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p26.29">Again it has zero force for zero slip ratio which is now a valid assumption if the results are correct. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p26.29">This model is quite inaccurate between 0.02 and 0.04 slip ratio. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p26.29">The results take a sharp corner here, which is hard to model. </s>
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">Recommendations </head>
<p n="p27.29">
<s n="s1.5;p27.29">When estimating the lateral and longitudinal forces in a practical situation like 'car safety when cornering' then it would be very important to use a model that gives an accurate estimate, one that can be used and built into the specifications of a car or tyre. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p27.29">I think that the non-linear models are really the only models that could be used in a practical sense. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p27.29">This is because slip angle or ratio has values that deviate and it would be hard to get these to stay under a particular value, as is necessary in the linear models. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p27.29">Also the non-linear models are accurate at the lower values as well, so they are the all-round performer. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p27.29">However more research is needed and more results need to be analysed before implementing one of these models in a practical situation. </s>
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">Conclusions</head>
<p n="p28.29">
<s n="s1.3;p28.29">From the results I can conclude that modeling is an effective way to estimate data. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p28.29">Although the data was small in quantity, models were still found that reproduced this data as a continuous function. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p28.29">It was found that when 0&lt;slipangle&lt;2.5 the linear model is most appropriate to find the lateral force. </s>
</p>
<p n="p29.29">
<s n="s1.4;p29.29">It was also found that if 0&lt;slip ratio&lt;0.3 then again a linear model is most appropriate to find the longitudinal force. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p29.29">It was also found that these linear models did not work beyond these values even to a reasonable degree. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p29.29">Non-linear models were then tested and it was found that these worked far better outside these boundaries and produced a comparable performance within them. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p29.29">Therefore for general use it can be concluded that the non-linear model is most accurate and efficient. </s>
