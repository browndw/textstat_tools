<head>Analysis of history</head>
<p n="p12.66">
<s n="s1.7;p12.66">Given the age of this patient and the history of PR bleeding, weight loss and a recent change of bowel habit, the most likely cause for this presentation is colorectal carcinoma. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p12.66">More specifically these symptoms suggest a left sided lesion. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p12.66">This is in contrast to the classical symptoms of a right-sided lesion which include anaemia, weight loss and a palpable mass. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p12.66">There was nothing in the history to suggest obstruction, perforation or fistula formation had occurred as a result. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p12.66">Other important differential diagnoses to consider would include chronic diverticular disease and diarrhoea resulting from infectious causes such as food poisoning (Salmonella), dysentery or viral enterocolitis. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p12.66">However as the symptoms, particularly PR bleeding, had persisted for nearly six weeks an infective cause seems quite unlikely. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p12.66">Medical causes such as excessive use of levothyroxine could also be responsible for his weight loss and diarrhoea however this would not cause rectal bleeding. </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.66">
<s n="s1.4;p13.66">Upon physical examination a focused abdominal examination will be carried out to look for specific signs such as abdominal tenderness or palpable masses. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p13.66">A rectal exam will also be performed to confirm the PR bleeding. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p13.66">In addition PR masses can be detected in 60% of right sided carcinomas (Longmore et al, 2004). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p13.66">A general examination should also be performed to look for relevant systemic signs such as anaemia, and to allow the patient's general health to be assessed. </s>

<s n="s2.5;p15.66">There was some finger clubbing present although this may have been congenital and therefore with hindsight this should have been queried further. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p15.66">There was no pain or palpable masses on abdominal exam, however these symptoms rarely occur in left-sided carcinoma unless the patient presents late or obstruction has occurred. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p15.66">Although tenderness in the LIF is usually present in chronic diverticular disease, this still remains an important differential at this stage which would require further investigation before being excluded. </s>

<s n="s3.5;p16.66">Although Mr <name type="other"/> also suffers from NIDDM and hypothyroidism, these have both been successfully controlled by medication, therefore he is otherwise fit and well and able to maintain a fully independent lifestyle. </s>

<p n="p17.66">
<s n="s1.5;p17.66">Elective patients such as Mr <name type="other"/> who present with suspected colorectal carcinoma should undergo routine bloods and biochemistry in order to detect anaemia or any other metabolic disturbances. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p17.66">Tumours markers such as carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA) can also be measured in order to aid diagnosis, monitor the disease and assess the effectiveness of treatment. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p17.66">Faecal occult blood may be carried out, although it is of little practical value within the hospital setting. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p17.66">However, the most important investigative technique in the diagnosis of colorectal cancer is imaging. </s>

<s n="s1.1;p19.66">
<hi rend="bold">Colonoscopy</hi>: Enables inspection of higher aspects of the colon and is currently the gold standard for investigating colorectal cancer as it also allows biopsies and polypectomies to be performed in order to obtain specimens for histological examination. </s>

<p rend="bulleted" n="p20.66">
<s n="s1.3;p20.66">
<hi rend="bold">Double contrast barium enema</hi>: Usually reveals the growth as either a stricture or a filling defect (apple-core deformity). </s>
