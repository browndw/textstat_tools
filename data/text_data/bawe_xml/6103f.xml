<s n="s2.5;p3.19">However, the impact energies are relatively low and characteristic of brittle failure. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p3.19">Theoretically, there is an increase of plastic deformation during failure which should cause increased fracture energies at higher temperatures. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p3.19">But this does not seem to be the case for the give data. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p3.19">Following the transition point, at approximately 20C, the gradient of the curve is therefore expected to be higher than obtained(?). </s>

</figure>
<p n="p5.19">
<s n="s1.3;p5.19">In relation to the general trend it can be seen that the results obtained for this experiment do not fit the trend perfectly. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p5.19">That is, the curve is out of shape. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p5.19">There seem to be two possible problems with the data; either that the impact energy is quite low for the tempering range 300-600C (although the behavior of the material in this range has the correct tendency), or that it is quite high for tempering at 200C. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.19">
<s n="s1.5;p6.19">Although the specimen notch sizes were consistent throughout the experiment, the results are out of trend, due to two possible factors. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p6.19">The first of these relate to the material used; it is possible that the wrong material was tested on a number of occasions. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p6.19">This was very likely the case with the 500C test which was repeated several times yielding much higher as well as much lower impact energy values than expected. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p6.19">The value finally settled at (52 ft/p) is itself also quite low. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p6.19">The second possibility is that some specimens were not heat treated properly, thus affecting the toughness of the steel and the corresponding impact energy values. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.19">
<s n="s1.3;p7.19">The crystallinity values on the other hand are almost reasonable. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p7.19">The variation shows that crystallinity is inversely proportional to temperature. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p7.19">This is the expected result since as the material becomes more ductile with temperature, crystallinity, which is a characteristic of brittleness is lost as the microstructure becomes increasingly fibrous. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.19">
<s n="s1.3;p8.19">Crystallinity profiles for 3 different temperatures were obtained and these demonstrate the reduction in crystallinity with higher tempering temperatures. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p8.19">In the final case there is almost zero crystallinity as the material is highly ductile, preventing total fracture due to the materials increased capacity to absorb impact energy - high toughness. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p8.19">T200 has the lowest toughness while T600 has the highest. </s>

<head>Effects of Carbon on Toughness</head>
<p n="p9.19">
<s n="s1.4;p9.19">Carbon and manganese have the largest affects on the transition (of ductile to brittle) temperature. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p9.19">An increase in carbon increases the transition temperature, shifting the relevant part of the curve to the right side of the graph. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p9.19">As a result of this, the brittle range for the steel increases whilst ductility range is decreased. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p10.19">Different types of steels vary in toughness, ranging from high toughness at all temperatures for austenitic steels to relatively brittle behaviour of martensitic steels. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p10.19">The toughness depends on the temperature and improves with increased temperatures. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.19">
<s n="s1.2;p11.19">The diagram below shows that there is an important difference at low temperatures between austenitic steels on the one hand and martensitic and ferritic steels on the other. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p11.19">Martensitic, ferritic and ferritic-austenitic steels are characterised by a transition in toughness, from tough to brittle behaviour, at the transition temperature. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.19">
<s n="s1.3;p12.19">For ferritic steel the transition temperature increases (with increasing carbon) where the steel becomes brittle at successively higher temperatures. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p12.19">For the ferritic-austenitic steels, there is a higher transition temperature as a result of the increased ferrite content (i.e. more brittle behaviour). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p12.19">It can be seen that austenitic steel do not exhibit a toughness transition as with the other steel types, but have high toughness at all temperatures, although it slightly decreases with lowering of temperature. </s>

<head>Conclusion </head>

<s n="s1.1;p13.19">The following points can be deduced from the investigation on steels using charpy impact testing: </s>
</p>
<p rend="ordered" n="p14.19">
<s n="s1.1;p14.19">1) Tough materials absorb a lot of energy when fractured while brittle materials absorb very little energy. </s>
</p>
<p rend="ordered" n="p15.19">
<s n="s1.1;p15.19">2) Increasing the carbon content decreases the ductility, and therefore embrittles the steel, decreases the charpy impact energy. </s>
</p>
<p rend="ordered" n="p16.19">
<s n="s1.1;p16.19">3) The energy absorbed in the impact test of an alloy steel at a given test temperature in general increases with increasing tempering temperature. </s>
</p>
<p rend="ordered" n="p17.19">
<s n="s1.2;p17.19">4) The ductile to brittle transition curve allows us to know the effect of temperature on the fracture energy. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p17.19">The impact energy generally decreases with decreasing temperature as the yield strength increases and the ductility decreases. </s>
</p>
<p rend="ordered" n="p18.19">
<s n="s1.1;p18.19">5) If the steel has a sharp ductile to brittle transition then a transition temperature can be defined below which the material has poor toughness. </s>
</p>
<p rend="ordered" n="p19.19">
<s n="s1.1;p19.19">6) The charpy impact test can be used to analyse the relative toughness of different materials to aid the designer in the selection of materials. </s>
