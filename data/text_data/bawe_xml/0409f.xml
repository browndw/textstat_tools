<p n="p5.38">
<s n="s1.3;p5.38">The brain drain is a transfer of skilled and high-skilled workers (13 years and above of tertiary education) which constitutes a loss in terms of externalities that the skilled migrants do not create when they leave the sending country and a benefit in terms of wealth and growth in the receiving country. </s>
