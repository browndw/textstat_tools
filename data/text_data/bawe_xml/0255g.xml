<s n="s1.3;p1.36">In the quest to discover the essential nature of the nexus between Lenin's political rule and theory it will be necessary to consult a variety of his writings to gain an insight into the development of his thought. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p1.36">What may become clear with a close reading is that there are some core principles that remained unchanged throughout his life in contrast to other immediate and improvised policies that he latched onto or jettisoned at will, according to circumstance. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p1.36">Furthermore, the sophisticated interpretations of some influential historians will add weight to the analysis and in an attempt to show the correlation between Leninism and Bolshevism Nikolai Bukharin and Evgenii Preobrazhensky's <hi rend="italic">ABC of Communism</hi> will offer a wealth of information. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.36">
<s n="s1.6;p2.36">Despite the limited chronological framework it will be of seminal importance to assess prominent works from the formative period prior to the February Revolution in order to witness how his thinking deviated from or remained true to his early beliefs. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p2.36">Wartime thoughts on <hi rend="italic">The War and Russian Social Democracy</hi> and his speech in January 1917 on the twelfth anniversary of "Bloody Sunday" will provide an insight into Lenin's revolutionary physiognomy and his socialist outlook in the immediate run up to revolution. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p2.36">Reaching further back will help to create a more complete picture of Leninism. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p2.36">Perhaps the earlier texts portray his political philosophy in its purest form before it became compromised by the expediencies of governance. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p2.36">
<hi rend="italic">The Tasks of the Proletariat in the Present Revolution</hi>, or the <hi rend="italic">April Theses</hi> as they have became known, <hi rend="italic">The State and Revolution</hi> and Lenin's resolutions at the 1921 Party Congress stand out from his work published after the revolution. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p2.36">In addition, his <hi rend="italic">Letters From Afar</hi>, <hi rend="italic">The Immediate Tasks of the Soviet Government</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Economics and Politics in the Era of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat</hi> and his writing <hi rend="italic">On Proletarian Culture</hi> are of significant merit. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p3.36">Lenin has undoubtedly been both 'praised beyond hyperbolae and damned with savage invective'.<ref target="BAWE_0255g-ftnote.001"/> In fact, 'acerbic clashes in interpretation were inevitable' in historiography concerning Lenin.<ref target="BAWE_0255g-ftnote.002"/> The present writer has found very little evidence that points toward a possible obloquy; however, the motivation here is not to produce a hagiography on an all ready well published theme. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p3.36">Neither will any attempt be made to speculate on the personal or psychological state of the man. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p3.36">This has already been achieved to some extent in three superb volumes by Robert Service and particularly in his <hi rend="italic">Lenin: A Biography</hi> in which the author intended to give a 'sense of personality' to an immense politician.<ref target="BAWE_0255g-ftnote.003"/> That said it will be necessary to reflect on Lenin's early years in order to provide a well-rounded examination of his political development. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p4.36">Neil Harding's opinion is that some commentators have been ignorant of 'the theoretical underpinning of Lenin's thought'.<ref target="BAWE_0255g-ftnote.004"/> The idea here is to assess the political leader, to show coherently, consistently and convincingly that Lenin had a distinct Marxian strategy for the development of socialism in Russia. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p4.36">The problems Lenin encountered in transposing his thought into reality will be mentioned but that does not detract from the deep sense of intellectual conviction involved in his work. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p4.36">A dissection of <hi rend="italic">The State and Revolution</hi>, one of the most critically important and thorough of Lenin's works, will serve as the perfect point of departure for a comparison of theory and policy during these decisive years. </s>

<s n="s6.7;p4.36">Therefore, this paper will take a sizeable chunk of work compiled between 1914 and 1921, and before, in order to highlight the major theoretical dogma that exists throughout and will consider the following fundamentals: organisation, production and the role of the party and society. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p4.36">Also, it will endeavour to explain the gradual move of the Bolshevik party from the conjectural opponent of the autocracy and bourgeoisie to the party as sponsor of the realistic functions of government. </s>

<s n="s8.10;p5.36">He championed the ideal of progress, that all classes would revolt against the tyranny of tsarism and the bourgeois liberals would provide the stepping stone to social revolution. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p5.36">In the last year of the century he 'lost faith' in both the frail proletariat and the fickle bourgeoisie. </s>

<s n="s1.10;p6.36">Pipes' use of the idea of democracy here falls foul of the Leninist paradox. </s>

<s n="s3.10;p6.36">A quick clarification may be in order. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p6.36">Indeed, Lenin was adamant that socialism was the only way to rid the world of the evils of exploitation. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p6.36">Furthermore, he did believe that one party as the representative of the oppressed masses could carry the weight of revolution on its shoulders and should explicitly, and violently if necessary, guard itself against opposition in order to do so. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p6.36">The fact that 'socialism presupposed democracy' meant that a redefinition of the term was needed and it should be kept in mind. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p6.36">It was not the Western liberal democracy, or contemporary notion, of political choice. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p6.36">He believed that social revolution was the way to realise mass participation in the governing of the socialist state, economic rather than political freedom and therefore ultimate egalitarianism. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p6.36">Hence, Bolshevism in Lenin's mind, and in this sense, was a form of total democracy.<ref target="BAWE_0255g-ftnote.006"/> When used negatively by Lenin it meant the former, when used in a positive sense it comes to mean the latter. </s>
