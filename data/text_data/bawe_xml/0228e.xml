<s n="s5.8;p23.33">Freehold land has not been depreciated which is also valid with normal accounting practice. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p23.33">The only slightly worrying figure is here is that some plant, equipment, or vehicle has a depreciation rate of 33.3% which seems a bit high. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p23.33">Either Kidde plc should invest in longer lasting assets or someone is taking liberties with the accounts. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p23.33">Apart from this the depreciation adjustments are reliable. </s>
</p>
<p n="p24.33">
<s n="s1.8;p24.33">Another accounting adjustment was made to the stocks. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p24.33">On page 26 of the annual report it states that 'stocks are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value'<hi rend="sup"> [17]</hi>. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p24.33">The Inland Revenue website states 'One of the acceptable basis of stock valuation is the lower of cost and net realisable value' <hi rend="sup">[18]</hi>. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p24.33">According to the report 'cost is calculated on an average or 'first in, first out' basis.' </s>
<s n="s5.8;p24.33">Both of these methods are valid however it may have been more useful if they stated what costs were calculated via a particular method. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p24.33">When making accounting adjustments Kidde plc have used well known adjustment methods for providing a true and fair view of the accounts. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p24.33">Inspecting the figures themselves there seems to be no discrepancies. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p24.33">Kidde plc has made reliable accounting adjustments. </s>
</p>
<p n="p25.33">
<s n="s1.3;p25.33">It is important to note that the PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have audited the accounts and found that 'the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group at 31 December 2003...' <hi rend="sup">[19]</hi> The auditors are an external independent company and Kidde plc have stringent regulations on even employing ex-employees of the auditors as stated on page 20 of the accounts <hi rend="sup">[20]</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p25.33">Ernst &amp; Young, a separate accountancy firm, worked with Kidde plc to make better financial decisions <hi rend="sup">[21]</hi>. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p25.33">It is clear that the auditors were completely independent from any other interaction with Kidde plc. </s>
</p>
<p n="p26.33">
<s n="s1.5;p26.33">There is a slightly puzzling figure in section 5 of the accounts when mentioning the disposal of fixed assets. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p26.33">Kidde plc made a £1.6m loss on disposal of fixed assets in 2003. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p26.33">However Baxi, an associated company of Kidde plc managed to make a £1.6m profit on disposal of fixed assets <hi rend="sup">[22][23]</hi>. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p26.33">These values match up all too conveniently and perhaps further investigation could be made. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p26.33">However it is noted in the exceptional items section which would suggest it is a one-off and would not be happening too frequently. </s>
</p>
<p n="p27.33">
<s n="s1.1;p27.33">Apart from this the Kidde plc annual report and accounts 2003 can be deemed reliable, and represent and a true and fair view of the financial health of the company. </s>

<head rend="underlined bold">4. Recommendation to Shareholder</head>
<p n="p28.33">
<s n="s1.4;p28.33">As stated in the conclusion to the performance section Kidde plc is a successful business. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p28.33">The growth rate has not been too explosive suggesting there is more growth yet to come. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p28.33">Kidde plc has a good relationship with investors, a strengthening market position and reputation and has a promising business strategy. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p28.33">For these reasons and those suggested in the conclusion of section 2 I would recommend buying more shares in Kidde plc. </s>

<head rend="underlined bold">5. Assessment of Potential Future Performance</head>
<p n="p29.33">
<s n="s1.10;p29.33">Kidde plc is a growing business. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p29.33">Every year it is implementing new strategies that help the business to thrive. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p29.33">The approach employed in 2004 was to concentrate on core business while still gaining extra income from acquisitions <hi rend="sup">[24]</hi>. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p29.33">Early in 2004 Kidde plc sold their shares in associated companies Baxi and Robbialac <hi rend="sup">[25]</hi>. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p29.33">In the previous report Baxi and Robbialac were regarded as non-core activities <hi rend="sup">[26]</hi>. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p29.33">Kidde plc also sold their investment in professional paint. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p29.33">These sales provided a small, one-off income for the business at the cost of losing the steady income obtained by acquisitions. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p29.33">To overcome this Kidde plc made new acquisitions of Harden SA, a provider of fire equipment and services <hi rend="sup">[27]</hi>, Croda (now named Kerr fire fighting chemicals), a provider of fire fighting chemicals <hi rend="sup">[28]</hi> and Gloria KG, a fire extinguish manufacturer <hi rend="sup">[29]</hi>. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p29.33">This strategy is very beneficial to the company these acquisitions relate more directly to core activities. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p29.33">Interaction with the acquired companies may assist in research and development and providing new services or products. </s>
</p>
<p n="p30.33">
<s n="s1.7;p30.33">In 2004 UTC (United Technologies Corporation), an American company, made bids to buy out Kidde plc. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p30.33">The BBC website stated that Kidde saw its share price rise by 20% ... after it confirmed it had rejected a £1.35bn ($2.46bn) takeover offer <hi rend="sup">[30]</hi>. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p30.33">It also mentioned that Kidde plc stated that 160p per share was materially understating the company <hi rend="sup">[31]</hi>. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p30.33">On the website analysts suggested that Kidde plc could have sold each share for 170p. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p30.33">However in the end Kidde plc was bought for 165p per share. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p30.33">If this is the case then why did Kidde plc sell out so low? </s>
<s n="s7.7;p30.33">Perhaps Kidde plc has some unknown difficulty that could have emerged as a real problem if they had not been bought out soon. </s>
</p>
<p n="p31.33">
<s n="s1.9;p31.33">Generally the takeover by UTC will generate more shareholder interest in Kidde plc and also cause share price to rise. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p31.33">Being bought out by an American company will also allow Kidde plc to get even more presence in America, in which some of Kidde plc's operations are based. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p31.33">The takeover will also please shareholders because there part of the deal included a 2p per share special interim dividend <hi rend="sup">[32]</hi>. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p31.33">It is also possible for UTC's rivals Fairfield and Honeywell to make higher bids which would only be more beneficial for Kidde plc <hi rend="sup">[33]</hi>. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p31.33">If UTC does win the bid Kidde plc will be reunited with Chubb plc who were bought out by UTC earlier. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p31.33">Kidde plc and Chubb plc were together as part of Williams plc and as shown in the ratios in the previous sections they enjoyed much success. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p31.33">However there were problems at that time which is what caused the demerger in 2000. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p31.33">Now Kidde plc have reorganised their structure and are in a better efficiency and management situation. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p31.33">By rejoining Chubb plc under new terms they may be able to achieve more accomplishments than before. </s>
</p>
<p n="p32.33">
<s n="s1.3;p32.33">According to the interim report Kidde plc have been making good progress in the first half of 2004 securing important fire protection contracts on the Boeing 7E7 Dreamliner <hi rend="sup">[34]</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p32.33">In all divisions Kidde plc has generated higher divisional profits than in the previous year. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p32.33">It has been a strong first half and on reading the interim report it would suggest that the rest of the year will be just as strong. </s>
</p>
<p n="p33.33">
<s n="s1.2;p33.33">In general Kidde plc is a business which has a determined strategy which will help generate revenue while still allowing strong development of products and services. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p33.33">They have new prospects in America and by concentrating on their core business they will be successful for more years to come. </s>
