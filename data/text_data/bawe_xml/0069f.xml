<s n="s2.4;p1.24">Essentially, the concern for a reviewing court is whether the power exercised/decision reached by a public body has been done so both within the limits of the statutory or prerogative powers conferred on the body (thereby '<hi rend="italic">intra vires</hi>') and in satisfaction of the requirements of natural justice or what has become more commonly known as the <hi rend="italic">'duty to act fairly</hi>

<s n="s3.4;p1.24">A decision-maker falling foul of these requirements is liable to have their decision quashed<ref target="BAWE_0069f-ftnote.003"/>. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p1.24">Developing this, in the seminal GCHQ case<ref target="BAWE_0069f-ftnote.004"/>, Lord Diplock usefully classified the ways in which a decision-maker may be considered to have acted '<hi rend="italic">ultra vires',</hi> and thereby established the principle grounds for judicial review under three heads: <hi rend="italic">illegality</hi>, <hi rend="italic">irrationality</hi> and <hi rend="italic">procedural impropriety.</hi> </s>

<s n="s1.4;p2.24">The scenarios depicted in this problem question require exploration of each of these grounds, including the recently developing doctrine of proportionality. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p2.24">It should be borne in mind, however, that this area of law is by no means clear-cut, having been developed pragmatically and somewhat unpredictably by the judiciary over many years, thereby leaving the system of judicial review shrouded by a degree of uncertainty. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p2.24">As we shall see, the stringency of judicial review and the availability of protective substantive/procedural guarantees for individuals affected by decision-maker's actions appear dependent on the circumstances of the case in question to some extent. </s>

<s n="s3.6;p4.24">It is well established that a failure of a decision-maker to take relevant considerations into account can render a decision void<ref target="BAWE_0069f-ftnote.006"/>. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p4.24">As a rule, for a court to invalidate a decision, it is not enough that considerations have been ignored which <hi rend="italic">could</hi> have been taken into account: it is only when the governing statute "expressly or impliedly identifies considerations <hi rend="italic">required to be taken into account</hi> by the authority" that a decision will be invalid because relevant considerations were ignored<ref target="BAWE_0069f-ftnote.007"/>. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p4.24">Broadening this requirement somewhat, it was also held that <hi rend="italic">"the more general and the more obviously important the consideration, the readier the court must be to hold that... it</hi> [must] <hi rend="italic">be taken into account"</hi>
<ref target="BAWE_0069f-ftnote.008"/>. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p4.24">Exemplifying this, the decision of an inspector conducting an inquiry into a compulsory purchase order to refuse to hear evidence relating to the owner's conduct as landlord was quashed since the evidence was considered so <hi rend="italic">"fundamental to the conduct and utility of the inquiry"</hi>, that it was unlawful to ignore it<ref target="BAWE_0069f-ftnote.009"/>. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p5.24">In our present scenario, while we do not know the exact statutory framework in place for determining the panel's discretion, it is clear that the evidence provided by X was highly relevant to the outcome of the hearing, since the panel's ability to make a decision is wholly dependant on the establishment of a second positive test. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p5.24">Thus, one can strongly contest that the panel was under an obligation to consider professional evidence which highlighted the possibility of that test being redundant, and by ignoring it the panel acted unlawfully<ref target="BAWE_0069f-ftnote.010"/>. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p6.24">X might also argue that in ignoring the possibilities highlighted by the medical report, and therefore by basing its decision on rebuttable evidence, the panel made an error of material fact. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p6.24">The House of Lords has established a ground of review based on mistake of fact amounting to 'unfairness'<ref target="BAWE_0069f-ftnote.011"/>, which arises when certain factors were present when the body made its decision, namely '<hi rend="italic">(i) an erroneous impression created by a mistake as to, or ignorance of a relevant fact; (ii) the fact being "established", in the sense that, had attention been drawn to the point, the correct position could have been shown by objective and uncontentious evidence and (iii) that the mistaken impression played a material part in the reasoning'</hi>

<s n="s2.4;p11.24">Exemplifying the court's pragmatism in this area, case law has demonstrated that this is essentially a question of the degree of formality in the decision-making process as to how stringently natural justice rules might be imported to regulate the decision-maker. </s>
