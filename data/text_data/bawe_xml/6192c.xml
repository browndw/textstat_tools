<s n="s2.4;p1.10">The gods are not bound by mortal morality and as such can do as they please, and within the divine structure Zeus as the father of the gods, retains dominance over the other divinities. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p1.10">We must analyse the myths involving sexual encounters and interpret them, and decide whether or not they are reflections of social concerns, taking for granted that the myths detailing rape and/or abduction will examine hierarchies of power and status by default. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p1.10">Zeitlin certainly suggests that the former is possible: </s>

<s n="s1.4;p2.10">When exploring social concerns, I am referring to the role of women in Greek society, and the attitude of men towards them. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p2.10">The women's desire (or lack thereof in the majority of cases) to be involved in these sexual encounters are rarely considered; in such a patriarchal society the focus is on attempting to demonstrate masculine superiority, engaging the ideals of the male being the active subject, and the female the passive object. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p2.10">One must bear in mind when examining the myths, however, that there is not one definitive interpretation of a myth, and that one must consider the media through which the myth is being communicated. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p3.10">An example of rape within divinity is Hades abduction of the daughter of the goddess Demeter, Persephone. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p3.10">Hades kidnaps her and takes her by force to the underworld despite her protestations, and as such is fairly simple to identify as a rape as opposed to another form of sexual encounter. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p3.10">This would suggest that Zeus (who approved the match) and Hades where in possession of high status in this instance, leading the hierarchy because of their rank as divine kings, and as men. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p3.10">Morford and Lenardon propose that <hi rend="italic">"a religious artist or critic might maintain that god's will is god's will, and it was divinely ordained to have Hades and Persephone as king and queen of the Underworld."</hi>
<ref target="BAWE_6192c-ftnote.003"/> The rape also teaches about social concerns, in reflection to that of forced marriage, providing a <hi rend="italic">"cultural archetype of marriage as a forcible abduction"</hi>
<ref target="BAWE_6192c-ftnote.004"/>. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p3.10">This rape reflects how a female can have no control over who she is married to, and highlights the development from maiden to woman, the death of childhood and the birth of adulthood at the loss of virginity. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p3.10">This is forced upon Persephone but is taken as Hades' right, and she must just accept it. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p3.10">Ovid describes the speed of the rape as "breathtaking", in his Metamorphoses, and Curren relates this to hierarchies of power: </s>

<s n="s2.3;p4.10">This is not presented as Hades' divine right as is often accepted of divinity, but more so as a brutal rape, and as a contemporary source suggests a contemplation of the distressing nature of such an act. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p4.10">This is largely un-sustained however, as most women (for example Semele, Dionysus' mother, who was 'raped' ((although even this is debatable)) by Zeus) are treated with disdain and often disowned after having been involved with sexual relations, desired or otherwise. </s>

<s n="s3.5;p5.10">She consistently refers to herself as <hi rend="italic">"bitch that I am", "whore that I am", "slut that I am",</hi> throughout the Iliad, and it becomes clear that she views herself as being in the wrong, not suggestive of having been raped or taken against her will. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p5.10">Suggestions of abduction arise in the instances in which she tries to defend herself, and can be seen as defensive manipulations of the truth. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p5.10">This further supports the idea that interpretation of a situation is key to defining what is rape and what is not, and how it is more often than not merely a matter of opinion. </s>
