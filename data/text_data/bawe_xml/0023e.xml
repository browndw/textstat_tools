<s n="s1.6;p121.122">Using the analysis programs and manual analysis techniques, a gearbox design consisting of two epicyclic gear arrangements can be produced, with the specifications and details described in previous sections. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p121.122">It is expected that the gearbox should be sufficient and cost effective enough to provide a ground point for the development of a gearbox for the situation required. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p121.122">The gearbox is made from a combination of nylon and phosphor bronze gears for the 1 <hi rend="sup">st</hi> and 2 <hi rend="sup">nd</hi> reduction stages respectively. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p121.122">The choice of nylon gears for the 1 <hi rend="sup">st</hi> reduction will hopefully allow a cost-effective solution to the gearbox problem. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p121.122">A suitable factor of safety has been included for both reduction stages. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p121.122">The gearbox casing allows the accommodation of the gears and suitable seals and bearings. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p122.122">In comparing the design in this report to other drill gearbox designs, it is concluded that the layout and size of the gearbox is comparable to designs of other handheld drill gearboxes. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p122.122">However, it may prove suitable, upon selection of a driving motor, to place said motor in the handle of the drill, and hence create a reduction, by bevel or worm gear, from the motor to the gearbox. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p122.122">The choice of epicyclic gears, as demonstrated, facilitates the inclusion of speed reduction techniques by rotating the ring gear by a variable amount to vary the ratio. </s>
