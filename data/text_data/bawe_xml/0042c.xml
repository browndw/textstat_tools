<s n="s1.3;p1.13">Leopold von Ranke (1795-1886), often acclaimed as the father of the scientific method of historiography, is compartmentalised by such a label. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p1.13">It will be argued that his methodology does not concur with that of <hi rend="italic">Geschichtswissenschaft</hi>, which would stress on absolute 'objectivity, validity and truth', but more importantly, would identify a 'recurrent theme'.<ref target="BAWE_0042c-ftnote.001"/> Furthermore, as Georg Iggers has argued, 'rigorous science' must ignore 'metaphysical speculation'.<ref target="BAWE_0042c-ftnote.002"/> Much of the aforementioned label associated with Ranke arises from the symbol that he became rather than what he actually wrote. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p1.13">Hans Scheier has argued that it was this legacy that distorted the definition of scientific history, whereby it became "a search for facts alone, with no laws or generalisations with a renunciation of all philosophy".<ref target="BAWE_0042c-ftnote.003"/> Ranke, on the other hand, had distanced himself from such extreme positions when he argued that "from the particular we can indeed...ascend to the universal", whereby it was implied that facts do indeed come together to portray a larger context.<ref target="BAWE_0042c-ftnote.004"/> </s>

<s n="s1.3;p2.13">However, this does not grant his system a scientific outlook. </s>

<s n="s3.3;p2.13">Corresponding approximately to the Aristotelian emphasis on 'man in action' and the rejection of the universal applicability of historical laws, Ranke is merely a key thinker in the line of thought that dominated Europe since the 18 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> century. <ref target="BAWE_0042c-ftnote.006"/> </s>

<s n="s1.8;p3.13">The main 'unscientific' problem in Ranke's system was his rejection of interpersonal analytical and intellectual differences. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p3.13">The historian must "accept only the complete certain", but are there any events- more so their conclusions- barring trivial ones that can escape the "posy and empty shadows" that have been cast over them by time?<ref target="BAWE_0042c-ftnote.007"/> For Ranke, history was about showing how it really was (<hi rend="italic">wie es eigentlich gewesen</hi>), and Georg Iggers has argued that instead of 'really' the word eigentlich should be taken to mean 'essentially'. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p3.13">Even Ranke tried to emphasise this point by arguing that history "is not so much about gathering facts as to understand[ing] them".<ref target="BAWE_0042c-ftnote.008"/> The problem, however, remains. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p3.13">'Understanding' the 'essence' of the facts is a concept that cannot be materialised without having to pass through human- and subjective human- agency. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p3.13">The historian, already constrained by an infinite number of facts and faced with the daunting prospect of selecting them without showing bias, is further curtailed by the absence of an overarching structure which would guide his research. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p3.13">In short, the demand of the structure and the supply of facts result in a situation not unlike that of the equilibrium in a market. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p3.13">It is an abstract possibility, but unattainable- hence unscientific. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p3.13">Thus, there are two fundamental problems in giving Ranke the aforementioned title- first, that his system was not scientific, and second, that he was not the first to construct such a system. </s>

<s n="s1.9;p6.13">This formula is universally applicable, no matter what the circumstances, because multiplying (a+b) with itself does indeed produce this outcome. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p6.13">Ranke's formula would look something like (f+u) = h, where <hi rend="italic">f</hi> are facts, <hi rend="italic">u</hi> is understanding and <hi rend="italic">h</hi> is history. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p6.13">Problems arise from the onset, as not only the collection of <hi rend="italic">f</hi> within the historian's grasp have to be complete, but to "get at the truth of the facts" his <hi rend="italic">u</hi> will have to be symmetrical in the most abstract form imaginable.<ref target="BAWE_0042c-ftnote.009"/> Additionally, this formula also assumes that <hi rend="italic">u</hi> is constant for all historians. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p6.13">While it is scientific to put forward an inaccurate formula (say, a <hi rend="sup">2</hi> + b <hi rend="sup">2</hi> + ab) and consequently correct it with application, it is extremely unclear what the correct <hi rend="italic">u</hi> is (since Ranke's take on many historical issues could be readily questioned) and even if an appropriate <hi rend="italic">u</hi> is determined, how to reorganise <hi rend="italic">f</hi>, if at all, to get to <hi rend="italic">h</hi>. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p6.13">In mathematics, one side of the equation can be looked at to correct the formula (say, pointing out that a <hi rend="sup">2</hi> + b <hi rend="sup">2</hi> + ab doesn't result from a+b being multiplied twice). </s>
<s n="s6.9;p6.13">With Ranke, one cannot look at the <hi rend="italic">h</hi>, since the historian can only proceed from the particular to the universal, if at all. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p6.13">In any case, <hi rend="italic">h</hi> too is relative to what type of history one seeks to write. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p6.13">There is, thus, no guarantee that both sides of the equation will, as they should, correspond with each other. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p6.13">Human subjectivity plays too great a role in a discipline such as history for it to be scientific. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p7.13">The role of intuition also mars the Rankean claim to scientificity. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p7.13">There is no guarantee about developing laws of history in Ranke, as he argued that "from the particular, you can <hi rend="italic">perhaps</hi> ascend to the general".<ref target="BAWE_0042c-ftnote.010"/> If we apply this to his stipulation for historians <hi rend="italic">viz</hi>. that the historian needs to be "as close as possible to the historical actor", we get a scientific method not unlike an operation whereby a problem is diagnosed inside a patient's body.<ref target="BAWE_0042c-ftnote.011"/> However, the doctor does not operate on a patient without an understanding of the various possible solutions, or in other words, laws of medicine. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p7.13">Ranke himself argued in <hi rend="italic">The Great Powers</hi>, "Attention ought to be directed, <hi rend="italic">not to the ideas</hi>...but to the people themselves who appear as actors in history".<ref target="BAWE_0042c-ftnote.012"/> However, to understand the complicated juxtaposition of historical actors and their actions, we need to look at what were the ideas that fuelled such actions, and whether they can be knit together to form a conceptualising framework. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p8.13">Ranke's "deep roots in the religious world of the 18 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> century" that filters through in his historiography is also a problematic element for its supposed scientificity.<ref target="BAWE_0042c-ftnote.013"/> According to him, the secret of world history lay in "spiritual forces...[which]...expand in the world,...fight, limit and overwhelm each other".<ref target="BAWE_0042c-ftnote.014"/> This led Ranke to celebrate power, and more specifically state power, and he goes on to say that "there appears to be a spiritual essence in power itself", which history ought to study.<ref target="BAWE_0042c-ftnote.015"/> With meticulous deliberation of facts for their own sake, this essence becomes revealed to the historian. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p8.13">Not only can we question such theologically grounded explanations of forces in world history, but it leads us back to the relativism inherent in the <hi rend="italic">u</hi> in the above-mentioned example. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p8.13">In his own works he makes assumptions based on these questionable conclusions that undermine his objectivity. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p8.13">For example, as editor of the <hi rend="italic">Historisch-Politische Zeitschrift</hi> (1833-6), in his "Dialogue on Politics" and "The Great Powers", Ranke argued that each state has a spiritual essence derived from God which it must preserve from outside intrusions.<ref target="BAWE_0042c-ftnote.016"/> What led him to such a not-so-modest claim is unexplored. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p8.13">Similarly, in his <hi rend="italic">History of the Latin and Teutonic Nations</hi> (1824), he argues that "one can almost perceive the unity of a single closer history" in the past of these nations.<ref target="BAWE_0042c-ftnote.017"/> It can be argued that what would have made his approach scientific was to specifically highlight similar traits in the separately written national histories, and identify a causal relationship between them. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p8.13">This would perhaps lend greater significance to some eras than others, and while perfectly acceptable by scientific standards, Ranke rejected this procedure by arguing that "every epoch is immediate to God".<ref target="BAWE_0042c-ftnote.018"/> Such continual references to the 'Holy Hieroglyph' have led Carl Becker to argue that Ranke's methodology implied 'intuitive subjectivism' whereby, given interpersonal differences in religious attitudes, every man would feel free to be his own historian, dealing a mortal blow to the universal applicability of scientific procedures.<ref target="BAWE_0042c-ftnote.019"/> </s>

<s n="s2.4;p10.13">His main sources were governmental archive materials in Vienna, Venice, Florence and Rome which primarily contained official papers and documents produced by foreign emissaries.<ref target="BAWE_0042c-ftnote.023"/> In other words, they were extremely state-centred sources- a history not of the people, but their unrepresentative aggregates.<ref target="BAWE_0042c-ftnote.024"/> Ranke himself conceded in his <hi rend="italic">History of the Popes</hi> that it primarily focussed on "the great men among them".<ref target="BAWE_0042c-ftnote.025"/> It could well be argued that the sociological and anthropological approach taken by the Annales school of historians in France in the 20 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> century satisfies 'scientificity' by this criteria far greater vis-à-vis Ranke. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p10.13">Similarly, his assertion that "India and China have a lengthy chronology", but at best a "natural history" is not based on sources studied that relate specifically to these civilisations, but on a <hi rend="italic">lack of</hi> available material and intuition.<ref target="BAWE_0042c-ftnote.026"/> Subsequent research by scholars like Kenneth Pomeranz (2001) unearth data and specific trends in Oriental societies that lead to conclusions much closer to what the ideal Rankean method would have been. </s>

<s n="s2.4;p12.13">Epistemological questions were being mulled by European scholars since the Enlightenment which led to the Scientific, French and Industrial Revolutions, and many of their answers coincided with what Ranke himself prescribed to.<ref target="BAWE_0042c-ftnote.031"/> The idea of <hi rend="italic">Quellenkritik</hi> i.e., critical interpretation of sources and "threading [them] into narratives" owed more to Wilhelm von Humboldt's reform of academic institutions in Germany after the Napoleonic wars in the early 19 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> century of which Ranke was merely a part.<ref target="BAWE_0042c-ftnote.032"/> Leonard Krieger identifies four principal legacies of Ranke and associates their usage much before the man himself propagated them. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p12.13">Use of source materials has been widely used since Thucydides, insistence on primary sources were practiced during the 15 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> century by humanists such as Jean Mabillion, application of philological methods of enquiry could be associated with Hamann and Herdet since the 18 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> century and seminars were used in the early 19 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> century by Ranke's mentor Barthold Georg Niebuhr.<ref target="BAWE_0042c-ftnote.033"/> Finally, Ranke made extensive use of- and stressed the importance of- footnotes in writing history. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p12.13">However, he "did not invent, but dramatised" the footnote, as its usage has been noted earlier.<ref target="BAWE_0042c-ftnote.034"/> Ranke may have been responsible for integrating these approaches to enmesh history within the academia as a separate discipline, but that is a question that does not concern this paper. </s>
