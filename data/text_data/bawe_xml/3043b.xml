<s n="s1.7;p1.72">This report provides an analysis of the broader business environment of the UK and France from a human resource perspective. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p1.72">The findings are taken as a basis to development an appropriate approach to people management of a British hospitality organisation entering the French market. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p1.72">Research has shown that similarities prevail, however, that there are also dissimilarities which should not be underestimated. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p1.72">In order to adjust best and perform well a polycentric orientation is chosen. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p1.72">Furthermore, resource, reward, training and development schemes are included suggesting a possible design for a luxury hotel. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p1.72">Another point discussed refers to equality approaches and their advantages and disadvantages for both employer and employee. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p1.72">It is concluded that similarities between the UK and France dominate but it should be beard in mind that there are also dissimilarities to which should be paid major attention in order to select the best human resource approach for the French market. </s>

<head rend="bold">1 Introduction</head>
<p n="p2.72">
<s n="s1.6;p2.72">
<hi rend="italic">The Châteaux Hotel Group</hi> was founded in 1990 in the UK (see Appendix 1). </s>
<s n="s2.6;p2.72">With three hotels <hi rend="italic">The Châteaux Hotel Group</hi> forms a group of hotels that have been renovated and refitted in accordance with their prestigious past and their many individual features. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p2.72">Each unit has its own style and character. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p2.72">Prime locations are in the countryside. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p2.72">These five star hotels house between 25 and 40 guest rooms, four to eight suites, food and beverage facilities and provide various leisure amenities and cultural programmes. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p2.72">
<hi rend="italic">The Châteaux Hotel Group</hi> operates three hotels in the UK. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.72">
<s n="s1.4;p3.72">Due to France's location in Europe and its constantly high number of tourist arrivals (WTO 2004) <hi rend="italic">The Châteaux Hotel Group</hi> is thinking about to open further properties in France. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p3.72">The country is situated in Western Europe and borders on Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Monaco, Andorra and Spain. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p3.72">France offers a great diversity of landscapes including rivers, lakes, coastlines and sea sides, mountain ranges, rural areas and cities. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p3.72">France is a democratic country and has got an economy which is shaped by private enterprises and substantial intervention by the government in key sectors such as transportation and communication that, however, is declining (Whyte 2004). </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.72">
<s n="s1.7;p4.72">The French hotel industry comprises nearly 30,000 establishments and can list 1.5 billion overnight stays in 2003. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p4.72">It is the most visited country (Ministère Délégué du Tourisme 2005a). </s>
<s n="s3.7;p4.72">Wine tourism is just one area of tourism opportunities in France. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p4.72">The economic potential of this market sector has not been realised for a long time. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p4.72">It has changed, however, since the last years. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p4.72">Wine-related attractions such as wine museums, wine routes or wine tasting have increased. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p4.72">It can be expected that this market sector is growing in future times (Frochot 2000). </s>

<head rend="bold">Part A</head>
<div2>
<head rend="bold">2 Evaluation of the Business Environment of the UK and France</head>
<div3>
<head rend="bold">2.1 Theoretical Framework </head>
<p n="p5.72">
<s n="s1.8;p5.72">The literature provides different approaches that help to identify the macro environment of an organisation. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p5.72">One of them is the PEST-framework which focuses on political, economic, social-cultural and technological influences. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p5.72">Political factors that may affect managing people include all actions a state is involved like legislation, regulation or transfer of power. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p5.72">Whereas economy comprises all fields that concern business including labour market socio-cultural influences look at values, attitudes, demography or education. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p5.72">The technological environment refers to changes and developments in this field that may have impacts on the industry and an organisation and its people management in particular (Campbell <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s6.8;p5.72">2002). </s>
<s n="s7.8;p5.72">Those external factors are crucial for a company entering a new market. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p5.72">However, they become even more important when entering a market abroad as the type of international strategy is affected by them including the human resource strategy (Boella and Goss-Turner 2005). </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.72">
<s n="s1.1;p6.72">Therefore, this paradigm is used to analyse and compare those factors regarding the broad business environment of the UK and France in order to facilitate decision-making in terms of implementation of strategies and personnel planning for a company planning to enter a foreign market. </s>
</p>
</div3>
<div3>
<head rend="bold">2.2 Political Influences</head>
<p n="p7.72">
<s n="s1.7;p7.72">Both the UK and France are countries whose political systems are based on democratic principles (Whyte 2005, Whyte 2004). </s>
<s n="s2.7;p7.72">This means for a British company that it will operate in a country with a stable democratic system similar to the one at home. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p7.72">Furthermore, both countries are members of the European Union (EU) and thus, some of the political decisions are made within a shared framework and affect both countries to the same extent. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p7.72">For example the Treaty of Maastricht on European Union includes, among others, the principle of <hi rend="italic">Freedom of Establishment</hi> (Europa 2004) which facilitates the process of entering the French market for British entrepreneurs. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p7.72">However, the <hi rend="italic">Social Charter</hi> of 1989, signed by EU member states, has had a major impact on employment issues on all political levels. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p7.72">It introduced several regulations including <hi rend="italic">Freedom of Movement</hi> within the Union for EU citizens (Holden and Claydon 2004). </s>
<s n="s7.7;p7.72">This means that employees can cross borders and take employment in other EU countries as well what again can be negatively and positively for the respective country depending on various factors like unemployment rate, shortage of labour force or level of remuneration. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.72">
<s n="s1.2;p8.72">Focusing on labour legislation it can be identified that the UK practices a very liberal approach in comparison to France that emphasises the protection of workers based on rights and agreements (Federation of European Employers 2004a). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p8.72">Therefore, setting up a business in France might be hampered by it. </s>
</p>
</div3>
<div3>
<head rend="bold">2.3 Economic Influences</head>
<div4>
<head rend="bold">2.3.1 Economic Performance</head>
<p n="p9.72">
<s n="s1.5;p9.72">The UK has one of the strongest economies in Europe. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p9.72">The service sector contributes the major part to the GDP and counts about two thirds of the total GDP (Whyte 2005). </s>
<s n="s3.5;p9.72">The overall GDP growth is above the EU and OECD average between 1994 and 2004 (see Appendix 2). </s>
<s n="s4.5;p9.72">The economic growth of France is below the total OECD level and only slightly above the EU average (see Appendix 2). </s>
<s n="s5.5;p9.72">The average income per capita, however, is comparable with the one of the UK (see Appendix 2). </s>
</p>
</div4>
<div4>
<head rend="bold">Labour Market</head>
<div5>
<head rend="bold">Employment and Unemployment</head>
<p n="p10.72">
<s n="s1.4;p10.72">The economic performance is also reflected in the rate of unemployment in both countries. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p10.72">The UK level of unemployment is below the EU and OECD average whereas France is above both averages (see Appendix 2). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p10.72">So, France, different from the UK, has to struggle with unemployment, high labour costs, an inflexible labour market and high taxes. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p10.72">About 15% of the total employment in France works in the travel and tourism sector compared to about 10% in the UK (see Appendix 2). </s>
</p>
</div5>
<div5>
<head rend="bold">International Migration</head>
<p n="p11.72">
<s n="s1.4;p11.72">International migration to the UK has been increased since the last years. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p11.72">This trend has been especially reinforced by joining the EU of ten further countries in 2004 (see Appendix 3). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p11.72">The situation is similar in France where the numbers of inward migration has risen (see Appendix 3). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p11.72">Migration workers do mostly low skilled jobs and are employed very often in the hospitality sector (ILO 2001). </s>
</p>
</div5>
<div5>
<head rend="bold">Working Hours and Wages</head>
<p n="p12.72">
<s n="s1.4;p12.72">The national minimum wage rate for the UK amounts €1,273 per month on the basis of a 40 hour week whereas the national minimum wage rate for France is €1,217.88 per month on the basis of 35 hours a week (Federation of European Employers 2005). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p12.72">However, reality shows that half of the employees in the hospitality sector have to work irregular hours (ILO 2001). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p12.72">This again may cause inappropriate behaviour towards customers because of stress, accidents at work or illness in the short and long run. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p12.72">So in the end, long hours can be more ineffective than effective for an organisation. </s>
</p>
</div5>
<div5>
<head rend="bold">Trade Unions</head>
<p n="p13.72">
<s n="s1.4;p13.72">Trade unions in France experienced a dramatic decline in their numbers what the proportion of 9% of unionised labour force shows (Federation of European Employers 2004b). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p13.72">The reason for the decline can be seen in a growing unemployment rate which caused that employers could choose from a greater variety of workers and so, preferred to employ non-unionised labour force (Gordon1993). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p13.72">The percentage of workers organised in the British trade union is higher than in France and counts about 30%. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p13.72">However, it is presumed that the figures will decline further in the upcoming years throughout Europe what could enforce that employer and employees are called to look for solutions on a business level (Federation of European Employers 2004b). </s>
</p>
</div5>
</div4>
</div3>
<div3>
<head rend="bold">Social-Cultural Influences</head>
<div4>
<head rend="bold">Demographic Trends</head>
<p n="p14.72">
<s n="s1.3;p14.72">Since the last 30 years the population is ageing in the UK. This development will continue over the next decades (see Appendix 4). </s>
<s n="s2.3;p14.72">It means for the tourism industry a growing market as the income of retirees went up over the last years continuously and life expectancy have also risen due to better health conditions (see Appendix 4). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p14.72">Implications can be the creation of new jobs in this sector but also changes in customer-employee relations what again may lead to shifts in required skills. </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.72">
<s n="s1.4;p15.72">Focusing on the age structure of France it is like in the UK. The number of retirees goes up significantly and at the same time the working population falls due to an upturn in the birth rate (Whyte 2004) (see Appendix 4). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p15.72">Thus, the consequences are similar to those of the UK. Although the disposable income of retirees is slowing down in France they still form a strong-financial group (Moreau 2002). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p15.72">Another fact that needs to be mentioned is the shortage of labour force that will probably arise due to the rising gap between working population and pensioners. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p15.72">This again may cause tremendous problems for organisations looking for staff. </s>
</p>
</div4>
<div4>
<head rend="bold">Education</head>
<p n="p16.72">
<s n="s1.3;p16.72">Both the UK and France have a highly-developed educational system. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p16.72">The number of those who attend higher education has increased dramatically since the last decades (Whyte 2004, Whyte 2005). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p16.72">However, the education system in France has often been criticised </s>
</p>
<quote lang="English">"to be elitist, inegalitarian, discriminatory, exclusive and to promote a split between the different education channels" (Trouvé 1994 p. 76). </quote>
<p n="p17.72">
<s n="s1.5;p17.72">In other words, the major emphasis is put on general education rather than vocational training. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p17.72">Furthermore, there is a lacking effort to provide courses that correspond with the needs of the market. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p17.72">Even though there have taken place improvements the French education system still prioritises formal academic teaching. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p17.72">This is also reflected in France's third rank in an international study looking at the number of people aged 20 to 24 who attend an educational institution (see Appendix 6). </s>
<s n="s5.5;p17.72">This means for the tourism industry a shortage of appropriate labour force as the example of the Rhône-Alpes region proves where jobseekers could not fulfil the requirements of vacancies due to missing formal training (ILO 2001). </s>
</p>
<p n="p18.72">
<s n="s1.3;p18.72">Vocational training is also poor in the UK. Providing more apprenticeships is meant to improve the situation (Whyte 2005). </s>
<s n="s2.3;p18.72">According to the Hospitality Training Foundation (2005) 30% of vacancies in hotels and restaurants in the UK could not be filled due to skills shortages. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p18.72">This shows that the situation is similar in both countries and the industry is faced with a lack of skilled workers (see Appendix 5). </s>
</p>
</div4>
</div3>
<div3>
<head rend="bold">2.5 Technological Influences</head>
<p n="p19.72">
<s n="s1.11;p19.72">The technological advance during the last decades has led to tremendous societal changes ranging from consumer behaviour to employment issues. </s>
<s n="s2.11;p19.72">Faster means of transportation, sophisticated communication and information systems are the result of the progress. </s>
<s n="s3.11;p19.72">It has caused shifts in nearly every field. </s>
<s n="s4.11;p19.72">Tourism workforce, now, has to deal with new booking procedures. </s>
<s n="s5.11;p19.72">CRSs and Internet require other skills from workers. </s>
<s n="s6.11;p19.72">The rapid change of technology intensifies the situation additionally (ILO 2001). </s>
<s n="s7.11;p19.72">Looking at the UK and France the approach to this development is broadly spoken similar. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p19.72">Even though, France lags behind in the Internet use compared to other European countries the penetration rate was still 37% in 2003. </s>
<s n="s9.11;p19.72">The UK counts with 56% of Internet usage to one of the countries with the highest rates (Whyte 2004). </s>
<s n="s10.11;p19.72">The figures are assumed to be higher in 2005. </s>
<s n="s11.11;p19.72">So, employees who are familiar with technological means to some extent facilitate the adoption of new technology applications in an organisation (see Appendix 6). </s>

<div3>
<head rend="bold">3.1 The Concept of Personnel Management</head>
<p n="p20.72">
<s n="s1.4;p20.72">The beginnings of wider personnel management (PM) reach back to the 1950s and changed over the next decades corresponding with shifts in policy, economy and society. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p20.72">In the 1980s, trade unions lost in importance due to low unemployment and the introducing of new labour legislation. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p20.72">This led to the idea to achieve best company performance by a committed labour force (McKenna and Beech 2002, Price 2000). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p20.72">Torrington and Chapman (cited in Torrington <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> 2002 p. 13) define the term as follow: </s>
</p>
<quote lang="English">"Personnel management is most realistically seen as a series of activities enabling working man and his employing organisation to reach agreement about the nature and objectives of the employment relationship between them, and then to fulfil those agreements."</quote>
<p n="p21.72">
<s n="s1.2;p21.72">It includes recruitment, training and development, payment matters, rewarding and emphasis on employees' needs in terms of work. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p21.72">PM is seen as rather reactive as proactive and strongly bureaucratic shaped (ibid). </s>
</p>
</div3>
<div3>
<head rend="bold">3.2 The Concept of Human Resource Management</head>
<p n="p22.72">
<s n="s1.2;p22.72">The emergence of human resource management (HRM) in the early 1990s is often seen as the advancement of PM. However, there exist many various opinions in what HRM is different from PM. Torrington <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s2.2;p22.72">(2002) advocate that PM and HRM are the same and stick to their definition of PM. Others like Storey (cited in Price 2000 p. 5) define the term as </s>
</p>
<quote lang="English">"... a distinctive approach to employment management which seeks to achieve competitive advantage through the strategic development of a highly committed and capable workforce, using an integrated array of cultural, structural and personnel techniques."</quote>
<p n="p23.72">
<s n="s1.7;p23.72">Following this definition of HRM it is assumed to be more strategic and supportive in order to achieve company objectives. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p23.72">This is believed to realise through training and development, appraisal, rewarding and resourcing. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p23.72">HRM is marked as being reactive and trying to meet future challenges a business could be faced with. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p23.72">Highly qualified and motivated employees are core factors and are meant to be more efficient for the organisation. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p23.72">Work-related needs of staff members are important and are aimed at fulfilling them. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p23.72">It is seen as prerequisite to benefit the most. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p23.72">So, HRM can be described as 'mediator' between labour force and company which has to manage the 'relationship' between both to be successful in terms of performance on all levels (Price 2000, McKenna and Beech 2002). </s>

</div3>

<head rend="bold">3.3 Harvard Model <hi rend="italic">versus</hi> Michigan Model</head>
<p n="p24.72">
<s n="s1.3;p24.72">The Harvard model refers to the soft approach of HRM. It views the workforce as 'humans' and embarks on a strategy that corporative objectives can be achieved more easily when employees and company cooperate. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p24.72">This is sought to realise by motivation, including staff into decision-making processes and an organisational structure employees can identify with. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p24.72">Workforce is seen as asset (Boella and Goss-Turner 2005, Price 2000). </s>
</p>
<p n="p25.72">
<s n="s1.2;p25.72">The Michigan model in contrast describes the hard approach of HRM. Labour force is seen as resource and advocates that the human capital should be treated like all other resources. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p25.72">Employees are 'used' to complete the organisation's goals and maximise its efficiency (Boella and Goss-Turner 2005, Price 2000). </s>

<p n="p61.72">
<s n="s1.4;p61.72">Although due to the globalisation some societies converge to some extent cultural differences still remain (Doyle 2004). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p61.72">For that reason, it is important that managers develop abilities such as being aware of foreign values, behaviours, work patterns and business practices etc. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p61.72">(Phillips cited in Doyle 2004). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p61.72">The approach applied to prepare managers for international assignments depends on several aspects including cultural distance, kind and size of company and so, its financial background or host country. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p63.72">With the special focus on international management it may include cultural, language and practical aspects. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p63.72">The actual required training, however, depends on the organisation's strategic approach in the host country. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p63.72">Whereas an ethnocentric orientation may emphasis language polycentrism could stress training of the parent company's home culture in order to understand decisions better. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p63.72">So as to find an appropriate scheme the company has to define which skills are required in terms of availability of functions and what skills could improve the productivity of the overall performance of the organisation. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p63.72">But when expanding abroad it should be considered, too, that there could be national differences in the provision of training schemes and thus, suitable labour force what again might influence the strategic approach of a firm (Hodgetts and Luthans 2000, Boella and Goss-Turner 2005). </s>

<hi rend="italic">The Victorian Châteaux Hotel</hi> is going to employ host country managers. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p64.72">Nevertheless, management development should prioritise cross-cultural activities in order to enhance the understanding of the home country culture. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p64.72">This might facilitate the interactions between both and hence, improve the performance of the hotel. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p64.72">Furthermore, a cultural exchange could also enrich the business in general. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p65.72">Polycentrism is the chosen strategic orientation for <hi rend="italic">The Victorian Châteaux Hotel</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p65.72">Therefore, the training scheme should be designed on the unit level as the local managers know best what skills and knowledge their employees need. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p65.72">Training may focus on interpersonal skills, communication or operational tasks. </s>

<s n="s5.6;p65.72">It should put major emphasis on it as it is fundamental to run the hotel successfully. </s>

<head rend="bold">8.1 Different Approaches to Equality</head>
<p n="p66.72">
<s n="s1.5;p66.72">Approaches that refer to the reduction of inequality and discrimination are the equal opportunities (EO) and the management of diversity (MD) approaches. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p66.72">The first one is meant to balance inequality by legislation and so, includes all members or groups of society. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p66.72">However, it focuses more on equal basic conditions than on equal outcomes. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p66.72">The second approach relates to the individual and how his/her situation can be improved in terms of equality (Torrington <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s5.5;p66.72">2002, Price 2000). </s>
</p>
<p n="p67.72">
<s n="s1.9;p67.72">A brief comparison between both ideas shows that there are some facts are overlapping, others not. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p67.72">The EO approach is to reduce inequality. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p67.72">Both employer and employee may benefit of it. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p67.72">In the case of the former it could be cost-saving because of a lower turnover rate and thus, at the same time increase productivity. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p67.72">The latter may enhance his/her career within the organisation due to working for the company for a longer time. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p67.72">However diversity might also reduce costs for employers in terms of training as MD could be already regarded as preparation for a foreign assignment. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p67.72">Otherwise, diversity can also hinder a smooth business. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p67.72">Different groups in terms of age, religion, ethnicity or social class might have unlike attitudes to work, abilities and skills, values what could become difficult to manage (Torrington <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s9.9;p67.72">2002). </s>
</p>
<p n="p68.72">
<s n="s1.1;p68.72">Which approach a company should select depends on various factors such as availability of workforce, country or legislation. </s>

<p n="p69.72">
<s n="s1.7;p69.72">
<hi rend="italic">The Victorian Châteaux Hotel</hi> should favour the MD approach. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p69.72">The French labour market is shaped by an increasing number of migration workers from different cultural backgrounds who are part of the personnel. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p69.72">Therefore, it is important that this diversity is managed well. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p69.72">This can reduce staff turnover what is of significance regarding the recommended service style. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p69.72">A relatively high level of empowerment of employees and the nature of the hotel product require a good training what causes costs. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p69.72">A high rate of labour turnover, however, means even higher costs for training as new staff needs to be trained in order to deliver the service which is expected by customers. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p69.72">Thus, the MD concept may contribute to a more efficient operation in all fields of the hotel. </s>

</p>
<p n="p71.72">
<s n="s1.9;p71.72">The recommended polycentric orientation of the unit should meet the French macro environment the best. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p71.72">Differences in business operation, organisational structure and socio-cultural matters are overcome by this approach. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p71.72">Nevertheless, it does not prevent any problems between home and host country and among the local staff. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p71.72">Therefore, respective schemes have to be implemented on all levels. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p71.72">Here, emphasis should be put on a good relation between both countries with the help of cross-cultural activities. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p71.72">Reward, training and development systems might be provided for managers and operational staff in order to motivate and train them and so, again make a major contribution towards a high performance of the hotel company. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p71.72">The MD approach seems to be most suitable and effective due to the increase of international migration workers. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p71.72">Especially the hospitality industry has to hire personnel from the second labour market what supports this choice. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p71.72">Only, if the workforce is managed well the organisation is doing the same. </s>
</p>
<p n="p72.72">
<s n="s1.2;p72.72">Even though, both countries are broadly spoken similar in terms of policy, economy and culture it has to be aware of differences, too, which should not be underestimated. </s>
