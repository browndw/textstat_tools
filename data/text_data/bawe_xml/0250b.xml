<s n="s3.4;p1.100">When the resistance of the gauges changes under load, a Wheatstone bridge circuit is utilised to convert this resistance change into a voltage. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p1.100">Finally a non-inverting operational amplifier circuit is introduced to the system to amplify the bridge voltage to a degree which can be digitised and analysed. </s>

<p n="p2.100">
<s n="s1.1;p2.100">The output voltage is found to follow an approximate linear relationship with the input load, and the designed system offers a sensitivity value of 12.5 V/N. </s>

<p n="p3.100">
<s n="s1.2;p3.100">It is believed that the sensitivity of the system could be improved by upgrading the gauge material at an extra cost, or by increasing the number of active gauges in the bridge circuit. </s>
