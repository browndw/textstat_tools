<s n="s3.7;p1.42">Because of the danger of botulism, the only safe method of canning most foods is under conditions of both high heat and pressure, normally at temperatures of 116-121Â°C depending on the type of food which is canned. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p40.42">In canning process, food products are heated sufficiently at high temperature and for a long period of time to destroy microbial growth and enzyme activity. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p40.42">As a result, sterilized foods have a shelf life in excess of six month at ambient temperatures. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p40.42">However, severe heat treatment of in container (canning) may produce substantial changes in nutritional and sensory components of the food. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p40.42">This can be minimized by either reducing the time during processing or processing food before packaging i.e. aseptic packaging. </s>

<item>Size of the container and shape (determines rate of heat transfer inside the container i.e. penetration to the centre). </item>
<item>Heating conditions (e.g. agitations of the container increases the rate of heat penetration in viscous or semi solid food).</item>
