<head>The British Isles from Neolithic times to the Iron Age</head>
<p n="p3.46">
<s n="s1.2;p3.46">Mesolithic Man had a largely animal product based diet, and agriculture was unknown. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p3.46">He possibly influenced the vegetation through planting of hazel (<hi rend="italic">Corylus avellana</hi>), but did not cause major changes such as soil erosion. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.46">
<s n="s1.5;p4.46">At the end of Mesolithic and beginning of Neolithic started the process of man made deforestation and the onset of agriculture. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p4.46">This more settled way of life was probably caused by an increase of the population and decrease of wild animal resources. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p4.46">Early Neolithic in 7,200 BP brought major woodland clearance which continued through the Bronze Age and later epochs (Evans 1993; Piggott 1981). </s>
<s n="s4.5;p4.46">Woodland clearing may have caused the ceasing of tufa formation in Southern England after about 6000-5000 BP (Evans 1993; Preece and Bridgeland 1998). </s>
<s n="s5.5;p4.46">On the European Continent similar development arose (Schmidtchen and Bork 2001). </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.46">
<s n="s1.1;p5.46">The spreading of farming practises over Europe happened from south-east to north-west from the beginning of the 9th millennium BP and reaching the Channel coasts of the continent by the middle or second half of the 5th millennium BP. All archaeological cultures involved were cultivating cereals (<hi rend="italic">Triticum monococcum, T. dicoccum</hi> and <hi rend="italic"> Hordeum hexastichon</hi>), using stones and raising domesticated animals (cattle, sheep, goats, pigs and dogs) in various proportions. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.46">
<s n="s1.6;p6.46">Neolithic agricultural techniques and cultivated cereal species reached Ireland in 5750 BP before they came to Britain in 5300 BP. By 2500 BC agriculture was the dominant land use system in most of lowland Britain (Simmons 2001). </s>
<s n="s2.6;p6.46">The first tools for soil cultivation were the hoe and spade. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p6.46">The first evidence found for the usage of ardmarks were disturbed soil profiles detected at several sites (WaylandÂ´s Smith in Berkshire c. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p6.46">2820 bc; Horslip c. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p6.46">3240 bc and South Street c. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p6.46">2820 bc in Wiltshire and several others in that period) (Piggott 1981; Preece and Bridgeland 1998). </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.46">
<s n="s1.5;p7.46">The expansion of open habitat taxa such as plantain (<hi rend="italic">Plantago lanceolata)</hi>, grasses (<hi rend="italic">Poaceae</hi> spp.) and dock (<hi rend="italic">Rumex</hi> spp.) are indicating farming and grazing activities (Piggott 1981; Wiltshire and Edwards 1998). </s>
<s n="s2.5;p7.46">Neolithic man took influence on the tree cover not only through burning and felling trees, but also through feeding domesticated animals with leaves of lopped trees (Edwards 1993). </s>
<s n="s3.5;p7.46">Nevertheless, the Elm decline did not happen due to the activity of Man, but due to the spreading of a fungal disease with the coleoptera <hi rend="italic">Scolytus scolytus</hi> as vector (Chambers 1993). </s>
<s n="s4.5;p7.46">The grazing in clearance sites was common and prevented woodland regeneration. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p7.46">Thus, clearance supported more bracken, grasses and on acid soil, heather. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.46">
<s n="s1.1;p8.46">In the early Neolithic the human population was increasing strongly, supported by the favourable climate of West Zone F II and by good crop yields due to the colonisation of fertile new wood soils, ash fertilisation, the introduction of new crops with few pests and diseases and few competition through weeds. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.46">
<s n="s1.4;p9.46">In the mid Neolithic the climate changed from West Zone F II (Atlantic) to F III (Sub-boreal), which led the population of England face less pleasant conditions. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p9.46">This caused a significant decrease of the population. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p9.46">Evidence is given for the abandonment of stony upland soil fields due to reduced fertility, erosion and leaching effects caused by increased precipitation (Favies Mortlock, Boardmanal. 1997). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p9.46">By that time the mixed Oak forest of the climatic optimum of the Atlantic phase had been in part cleared (Wiltshire and Edwards 1998). </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.46">
<s n="s1.1;p10.46">Soil fertility losses through erosion may have led to the introduction of manuring fields from the second millennium BC onwards (Fowler 1981). </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.46">
<s n="s1.5;p11.46">In the late Neolithic the population stabilized again, and food production took place on mixed farming systems. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p11.46">In this period many aspects of our present landscape have their origin. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p11.46">Increasing animal husbandry caused the introduction of continental European weed species such as <hi rend="italic">Arcticum</hi> spp., but also the grassland vegetation of the present was formed. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p11.46">This vegetation is highly adapted to either animal based selection in pasture grassland or selection by the type and frequency of mowing for hay as winter fodder in meadows. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p11.46">The invention of the sickle was the major step for the creation of meadows. </s>

<div2>
<head rend="bold">Changes in Bronze Age (1700-500 BC)</head>
<p n="p12.46">
<s n="s1.2;p12.46">The technique of bronze smelting was brought to the British Isles at the beginning of the Bronze Age. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p12.46">In the first millennium BC rye (<hi rend="italic">Secale cereale)</hi> and oats (<hi rend="italic">Avena spp.)</hi> were introduced to Britain, and <hi rend="italic">Agropyron repens</hi> came in as a weed (Simmons 2001), although other authors disagree with this. </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.46">
<s n="s1.3;p13.46">The climatic changes in mid and late Neolithic and worsening conditions of soil erosion and fertility forced many settlers of upland areas to give up their settlements. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p13.46">The wheat growing areas were restricted to Southern and Eastern England, while barley was the predominant cereal crop of the highlands. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p13.46">Apart from barley cultivation animal husbandry dominated the climatically rougher parts of the British Isles. </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="bold">Changes in Iron Age (500-55 BC)</head>
<p n="p14.46">
<s n="s1.6;p14.46">Iron Age technology came to Britain in the seventh or sixth century BC, probably by Celtic tribes. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p14.46">A shift from non-permanent to permanent, enclosed settlements on hill tops preceded the new technology. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p14.46">The iron plough replaced the stone ard, which worked by tearing open the top soil, now leading to a turning of the top soil. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p14.46">This led to working on heavier clay soils for the first time, and to strip ploughing with its characteristic ridge and furrow pattern of the fields. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p14.46">A wide range of new crop plants was introduced, among them flax (<hi rend="italic">Linum usitatissimum)</hi> and new wheat species. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p14.46">Beech and hornbeam increased in the south (Fowler 1981). </s>

<s n="s2.7;p15.46">The organic O horizon covers a grey Ea horizon depleted from free iron. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p15.46">All free iron is translocated into the B horizon. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p15.46">Above the iron accumulation a dark humus rich layer is accumulated (the Bh). </s>
<s n="s5.7;p15.46">The most important characteristic of many podzols however is a strong brown or rusty coloured iron/aluminium rich Bs horizon. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p15.46">Peaty gleyed podzols have a layer of peat above the Eag. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p15.46">Underneath comes a thin iron pan (Bi), which builds a barrier to roots and water, leading to vegetative mat formation on the surface. </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.46">
<s n="s1.3;p16.46">Podzolisation denotes a change in land use from a forest/arable land use to seasonal pastoral activities associated with deteriorating pastures and heather scrub. </s>

<p n="p19.46">
<s n="s1.2;p19.46">Rendzina soils are commonly found on chalk material and limestone. </s>

<head>Lowland Britain</head>
<p n="p23.46">
<s n="s1.4;p23.46">Most of the British lowland terrain was covered by deciduous forest prior to Neolithic times, which favoured a nutrient recycling process and resulted in little decline in base content. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p23.46">These soils were mainly brown earths on well-drained sites and gley soils on badly or slow drained sites (Courtney, Curtis, Trudgill 1976). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p23.46">The woodland clearance and burning of Neolithic and later times led to an initial increase of plant nutrients through ash fertilisation and high turnover of organic matter due to ploughing and soil aeration. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p23.46">But the burning caused as much as 70% loss of vegetation bound Nitrogen, Sulphur and Phospor into the atmosphere. </s>
</p>
<p n="p24.46">
<s n="s1.6;p24.46">This nutrient boost was used up within a couple of years. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p24.46">Subsequent land use practices led to nutrient losses. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p24.46">Nutrient export (particularly Nitrogen and Phosphor) took mainly place due to grazing combined with stable/kraal husbandry, hay making without fertilizing and crop harvesting. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p24.46">Leaching, the loss of water-soluble soil components due to precipitation occurred and caused decalcification and further loss of nutrients. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p24.46">Run-off was also happening in winter, when precipitation was high and fields lay bare. </s>

<s n="s2.4;p25.46">The initially high proportion of calcium carbonate from chalk derived soils in humid Britain however is slowly washed out. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p25.46">This leaves a non-calcareous clayey material, the brown earths. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p25.46">Nevertheless, a large part of the British solid chalk outcrop was covered by superficial deposits such as loess, clay-with-flints, Plateau drift and Coombe deposits and therefore does not carry brown earth. </s>

<p n="p46.46">
<s n="s1.4;p46.46">Due to in the Neolithic "invented" land use forms plant communities such as the meadows, pastures and rural flora communities have evolved. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p46.46">They heavily depend on the land use system, e.g. regular cuts in meadows, soil compaction and food selection of livestock in pasture, ploughing and fallow in field systems, heathland management with fire. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p46.46">For the selection of settlement areas the role of loess deposits was less important than in continental Europe, due to the comparably small extension of loess deposits. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p46.46">The current woodland types of Europe were also selected by human activities, see Figure 7. </s>
