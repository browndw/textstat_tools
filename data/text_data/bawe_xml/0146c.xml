<p n="p26.286">
<s n="s1.2;p26.286">As the signal path length increased, the noise distortion made operation of the LED Driver PCB more unreliable. </s>

<s n="s3.7;p27.286">PCBs offer a reliable solution for replacement of repeated electronic circuitry. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p27.286">PCBs are designed using Computer Aided Design (CAD) tools such as Protel DXP <hi rend="sup">4</hi>, which use electrical and design rules, net-listing and auto-routing to aid PCB layout design. </s>

<s n="s2.2;p30.286">This approach met with little success, due to the complexity of using a real-time device such as a PLD. </s>
</p>
<p n="p31.286">
<s n="s1.3;p31.286">PLDs are an array of programmable logic gates, with connections made and broken between the gates that are described by compiling the code (such as VHDL) used to generate them. </s>

</p>
<p n="p32.286">
<s n="s1.3;p32.286">Microcontrollers incorporate many features required of a much larger computer, such as processing, memory and I/O. Many are programmable using high-level languages such as C#, as well as low-level Assembler. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p32.286">The functions of the microcontroller are all controlled in the software written for it, and timing issues are resolved because everything operates at the speed of the microcontroller. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p32.286">The microcontroller is less than ideal for asynchronous operation due to the microcontroller following a linear program, although the use of interrupts can overcome this to some extent. </s>
</p>
<p n="p33.286">
<s n="s1.1;p33.286">Due to the previous experience within the group with C# over VHDL, and their generally greater reliability and repeatability, microcontrollers were selected to be used to interface between the Master Scorer PC and the electronics. </s>

<s n="s2.5;p35.286">This makes use of three lines called Data, Clock and CS. Data is read serially into SPI devices by synchronising with the clock edges. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p35.286">In the case of the MAX6952 LED Driver IC this is 16-bit data and so 16 clock pulses are required to read in one instruction. </s>

<s n="s3.3;p36.286">An individual Clock and Data pin on the microcontroller would then have supplied the logic signal for all the LED Driver ICs in the Main Scoreboard simultaneously. </s>
</p>
<p n="p37.286">
<s n="s1.5;p37.286">When attempting to implement this system, problems were encountered with signal degradation due to the 'fan-out' scheme. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p37.286">On a test bench, it was found that the microcontroller was only capable of supplying a maximum of three parallel Clock or Data inputs to the LED Driver ICs. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p37.286">This discovery was not acceptable, as there were not enough free pins on the microcontroller to allow individual Clock and Data signal lines to each LED Driver IC. Therefore, another system had to be developed to enable the microcontroller to drive the Clock and Data inputs of all 56 LED Driver ICs. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p37.286">Several methods were attempted to counter this effect; for example, through the use of buffering (see Appendix G) and demultiplexing all three SPI lines. </s>
