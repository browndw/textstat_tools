<p>Cylindrical bars of Aluminium, Copper and Corundum were oscillated, and the resonant frequencies measured to determine the Sheer Modulus (G) and Young's Modulus (E) of the materials. These results were then used to calculate an estimate of the Poisson Ratio (υ) for the materials.</p>
<p>The values obtained were:</p>
<table id="BAWE_0074b-tab.001">
<row>
<cell/>
</row>
</table>
<p>The Young's modulus values did not agree with the reference vales from Kaye and Laby, and it was concluded this was due to the theory being used being very sensitive to small errors in the measurement of the resonant frequencies.</p>
<p>The Shear modulus values agreed reasonably with the exception of Corundum. This discrepancy was attributed to intermediate resonant frequencies being measured.</p>
<p>Due to the significant discrepancies in the values for Young's modulus, the values for the Poisson ratio are not reliable, and their negative value reflect this.</p>
<p>It was also concluded that all the random error values quoted were underestimated.</p>

<s n="s1.3;p68.79">The values for the Shear modulus agree well for aluminium, and reasonably well for copper. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p68.79">However the value for Corundum bears no relation to the actual value at all. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p68.79">The values for Young's modulus, are all in complete disagreement with the values form Kaye and Laby. </s>
</p>
<p n="p69.79">
<s n="s1.3;p69.79">The values for the Poisson ratio are in total disagreement with the reference values, and in fact are negative, which cannot be true. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p69.79">This is as the values calculated are derived from the values for the Shear modulus and Young's modulus calculated, and these values are clearly inaccurate. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p69.79">Until more accurate values of these moduli can be calculated, it is not possible to find a meaningful estimate of the Poisson ratio. </s>
</p>
<p n="p70.79">
<s n="s1.2;p70.79">Ignoring the first two results, every value calculated here seems to differ significantly from the actual value for the materials. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p70.79">All of the values are half or less of their actual value, and so this suggest that a systematic error is responsible. </s>
</p>
<p n="p71.79">
<s n="s1.3;p71.79">Looking at the equation 1.12, used to calculate Young's modulus, we can see that the 'main input value' into this equation is the gradient of the graph. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p71.79">This value is then raised to the power four. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p71.79">This is a very large power to raise by, and any small deviation in the gradient would have a large effect on the value of Young's modulus calculated. </s>
</p>
<p n="p72.79">
<s n="s1.3;p72.79">Inputting the reference value of Young's modulus for Aluminium into equation 1.12, and working backwards gives that the ideal gradient would be approx 16.1. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p72.79">Compared with the gradient from the graph produced of 15.1 this is not the enormous difference seen in the final calculated values. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p72.79">It seems it does not take much of an error in the gradient to cause significant problems in the final solution. </s>
</p>
<p n="p73.79">
<s n="s1.1;p73.79">For the Shear modulus, however, the value of the gradient is only squared, and so the calculations are less sensitive, allowing the values for Aluminium and Copper to agree reasonably with the expected values. </s>
</p>
<p n="p74.79">
<s n="s1.3;p74.79">The value for corundum is still significantly out. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p74.79">This could be explained if too many intermediate resonances were included in the results. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p74.79">This would make the gradient shallower, and so reduce the value of G calculated. </s>
</p>
<p n="p75.79">
<s n="s1.2;p75.79">From the results above it is clear that even for the best result (Shear modulus of Aluminium) the errors have been severely underestimated. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p75.79">The graphs (figures 3 and 4) show that the error bars are no where near large enough to encompass the linear trends, and so the error estimates in the frequency are probably the source of this underestimate. </s>
</p>
<p n="p76.79">
<s n="s1.2;p76.79">The error in frequency was estimated according to the precision of the oscillator read-out, however this does not well represent the uncertainty in the frequency at which the resonance occurs. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p76.79">In the experiment, the resonance was present over a small range of frequencies around the point measured, and it would be more realistic to have estimated the error based on the width of this range. </s>
</p>
<p n="p77.79">
<s n="s1.3;p77.79">The calculation of Young's modulus could be improved in two ways. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p77.79">Firstly, taking significantly more values for resonant frequencies, over a much larger range of frequencies, would significantly reduce the error in the linear trend from which the gradient was taken. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p77.79">In order to achieve this, the experiment would have to be much more sensitive to the small changes in amplitude required to observe resonances at higher frequencies. </s>
</p>
<p n="p78.79">
<s n="s1.2;p78.79">Improvements could also be made by more accurately determining the exact frequencies at which the bar is resonating. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p78.79">This could be done by using a more precise oscillator, where the frequency is know to a higher accuracy, and can be varied more finely. </s>
</p>
<p n="p79.79">
<s n="s1.3;p79.79">Improving the values for the Shear modulus could be made in the same way. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p79.79">The more precise measurements would help reduced the amount by which the values differ from the expected ones. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p79.79">While taking values over a greater range, would enable a more accurate measurement to be taken for corundum, assuming the lack of proper resonances was the cause of the discrepancy observed. </s>
