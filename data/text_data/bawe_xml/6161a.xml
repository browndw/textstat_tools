<head>4.3 Re-forestation.</head>

<s n="s1.6;p18.18">Re-planting millions of ha with new trees would be an attempt to reduce atmospheric CO <hi rend="sub">2</hi>, trees act as a vegetation based 'carbon sink' (3). </s>
<s n="s2.6;p18.18">Reforestation and grassland restoration would help put CO <hi rend="sub">2</hi> back into soil storage too. </s>

<s n="s4.6;p18.18">For example to sequester all the UK's continuing carbon emissions in trees would require new forests to be planted over an area the size of Devon and Cornwall each year (7). </s>
<s n="s5.6;p18.18">To conclude, our production, processing and use of biomass can emit greenhouse gasses such as methane and carbon dioxide, which contribute to global warming and climate change. </s>
