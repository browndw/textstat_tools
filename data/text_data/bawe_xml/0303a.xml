<s n="s1.6;p19.20">It seems then that there could not be a physically identical world in which consciousness did not exist. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p19.20">Kripke's conclusions in <hi rend="italic">Naming and Necessity</hi> would suggest that it is possible, but in analysing his argument we can see that the connection between the mental and the physical in 'pain = C-fibre stimulation' is the same as 'heat = molecular motion' and that the illusion of contingency can be explained in precisely the same way for both. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p19.20">Kripke seems to hold that coherent conceivability of something can be a guide to what is metaphysically possible but, to borrow Soames' (2006; 21) example, I can coherently conceive of not having come from a sperm and an egg; I may have been manufactured from dandelions for example, but this does not mean that it is metaphysically possible for me to have not come from a sperm and an egg. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p19.20">As pointed out earlier, coherent conceivability has a wider scope; contains more possible world-states, than what is contained within the set of strict metaphysically possible world-states. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p19.20">Kripke's advocacy of coherent conceivability as a guide to the metaphysically possible is also in stark contrast with the illusion of contingency that he is trying to explain away. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p19.20">The reason that we think that 'pain = C-fibre stimulation' is contingent is precisely because we can coherently conceive of possible worlds where this identity does not hold. </s>

<p n="p20.20">
<s n="s1.3;p20.20">Kripke's arguments suggest, contrary to intention, that 'pain = C-fibre stimulation' is metaphysically necessary and so there cannot be a physically identical world in which consciousness does not exist. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p20.20">I think, however, that this conclusion is far from evident and that problems of multiple-realisability present a strong challenge to the mind-brain identity theorist and, if 'heat = molecular motion' is the same as 'pain = C-fibre stimulation' then it inadvertently presents a challenge to the Kripkean notion of scientific identification as well. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p20.20">That one can coherently conceive of sentient beings that feel pain without the apparently necessary C-fibres, or that C-fibres may play another role in a different species mental activity has an intuitive appeal to it, that, through equivalence, seems to undermine Kripke's notion of the necessary, a posteriori status of identity statements. </s>
