<head>1. The Firm's strategy and objectives</head>
<p n="p2.66">
<s n="s1.6;p2.66">The Firm is a manufactory which produces electronic car aerials and sells them by a chain of distributors and Original Equipment Manufactories (OEM). </s>
<s n="s2.6;p2.66">It has one product which make up of three components and the sales revenue was about 12.7million sterling last year. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p2.66">As a manufacturing team' our group established strategy and objectives separately by financial orientated and customers orientated. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p2.66">The objective for finance is that achieving highly return on investment in short term. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p2.66">For customers' our aim is to optimize production planning and control system to meet customers' requirement. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p2.66">In a word' the firm's objective is to make profit through satisfy customers' need. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p3.66">
<s n="s1.8;p3.66">â€¢ Level 1 stage: Based on the objective and industry attribute' our strategy was to make to stock production planning. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p3.66">We forecasted next week's demand by last year's demand data. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p3.66">From analysis of them' we found that every four weeks there was a trend of peak demand resulted from the OEM customer's order. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p3.66">We remained our buffer stock about 5000 finished products and kept regular production at 5000 units a week. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p3.66">Because of the delivery time and material and inventory cost of components are different' we order main body and aerial once a week in advance and the amount is about 5000 units separately. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p3.66">Due to the accessories material and inventory cost was low and delivery time was two weeks' we order them two weeks before production and stock them as inventory components. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p3.66">After calculated cost of different shifts' we adopted the day shift because of the cheapest cost and added evening shift for peak week production. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p3.66">During the first 4 weeks' we successful satisfied customers' demand and didn't have penalty at all. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p4.66">
<s n="s1.9;p4.66">Level 2stage: The following weeks' situation from 17 to 20 was slight changed by production lost. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p4.66">There were about 10% lost which included scrap 5%' rework 2%' and machine down time 3%. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p4.66">Our strategy wasn't changed in level 2. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p4.66">After good feedback and cash return in level 1' we decided to stick to the strategy. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p4.66">One aspect need to be considered was that we add 10% more for our production planning because the above lost by scrap' rework and machine down time. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p4.66">That meant we kept 5000 finished products as buffer stock and produced 5500 units every week except the peak week. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p4.66">In week 18' we used day and 5 evening shifts to produce 6250 units for the peak demand. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p4.66">Meanwhile' we transfer part of our cash from current account to deposit account for earning 8.5% interest. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p4.66">At the end of week 20' we still earned money by satisfying customers' demand. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p5.66">
<s n="s1.9;p5.66">Level 3 stage: This 4 week's analysis from 21 to 24 was really complicated than before. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p5.66">First of all' the company added a new product to production line' then the shifts of two products cost differently. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p5.66">We changed our strategy from keep safety stock to reduce the inventory lowest and make most cash flow. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p5.66">We forecasted the demand of standard and XL products by last year's demand and added 10% more on them. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p5.66">The day shift was still the cheapest one and first choice for production. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p5.66">We also used night shift for peak time production. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p5.66">Because of the demand of accessories grew to double amount' we order them once a week and two weeks in advance. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p5.66">During week 23' we wanted to use out of our inventory and stopped to order material in a week. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p5.66">It caused that our products amount was less than customers' demand and large penalty. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.66">
<s n="s1.10;p6.66">In conclusion' our original strategy in level 1 and 2 was correct and brilliant. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p6.66">We defined a clear logical strategy which used "make to stock" production. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p6.66">It implemented well and made great effect for customer satisfaction and return on invest. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p6.66">We kept stable production and buffer finished goods stock for the regular circle peak demand and prevented us from penalty. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p6.66">We ordered most of raw material just in time to avoid inventory cost. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p6.66">But in level 3' we made a radical mistake for changing the strategy. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p6.66">Considered about the competition between different groups' we tried to use out of our inventory and made maximum cash flow to win the simulation game. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p6.66">That was the reason which caused huge penalty about 59'500 pounds. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p6.66">We failed to meet the customer focused and financial focused objectives successful finally. </s>

<head>2. Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)</head>
<div3>
<head>2.1 EOQ Concept</head>
<p n="p8.66">
<s n="s1.2;p8.66">(Plossl' 1985) pointed that in inventory management the most important decision was that of balancing the inventory holding cost against the replenishment reordering cost. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p8.66">The detail explanation can be indicated in the following diagram. </s>
</p>
<figure id="BAWE_0159b-fig.001">

<s n="s1.7;p9.66">From the above figure' some features can be noticed. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p9.66">The stockholding cost increases in a straight line while quantity increasing. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p9.66">Compared to the stockholding cost' the ordering cost decreased shapely at beginning and then slowly reduces while the quality increasing. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p9.66">It is easy to find that the point where the stockholding cost line and ordering cost curve cross is the lowest total cost point. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p9.66">That means the quantities of that point are the economic order quantity (EOQ). </s>
<s n="s6.7;p9.66">Another rule is that the total cost fluctuates smoothly around the EOQ point which indicates inventory management cost couldn't be affected dramatically by the small change of order quantity around the lowest cost point. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p9.66">The relative batch size can be calculated by the following formula which describes the relationship between cost of ordering' cost of holding stock and batch quantity. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p19.66">Compared to the firm's original production planning and ordering quantity' it is seen obviously that the main body and aerial components quantities are near the EOQ but the accessories order quantities is far away from the EOQ. These results from the different unit cost of three components. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p19.66">Based on inventory Pareto analysis' the accessories are almost belonging to class C which cost lowest annual spend of whole inventory cost. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p19.66">(Waters' 2003) argued that class C should be ordered in large batch for high volume safety inventory. </s>

<s n="s3.3;p20.66">(Volmann' Berry' Whybark' 2005) pointed that a reasonable diversification didn't result any serious lost of economics of EOQ. EOQ calculations are only a starting point and the company could arrange its production planning around it for many reasons' such as scrap losses' minimum quantities for ordering' and maximum limitation for production capacity and so on. </s>
