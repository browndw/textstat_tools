<s n="s1.5;p20.22">Political impact has been playing a chief role in the tourism industry. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p20.22">It is because whenever any policy imposed by the government, it has a profound influence to both the local residents and tourists in both the positive and negative way. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p20.22">For instance, there is a strategy called National Tourism Strategy which is adopted by the government in 1999, it includes measures to promote the planning and transport issues associated with tourism, manage visitor flows, maximise the benefits of tourism for local economies, establish an effective policy framework and build partnerships with the public, private and voluntary sectors (Oxfordshire Country Council, 2004c). </s>
<s n="s4.5;p20.22">Take traffic congestion as an illustration, it does not only affect the residents and workers, but also perceived by visitors as one of their major dislikes of the places. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p20.22">In Oxford, One of the traffic management proposals is the removal of all traffic from Cornmarket Street and the reduction of traffic in High Street and St. Aldate's, it is used to improve tourists perception of Oxford. </s>

<p n="p21.22">
<s n="s1.4;p21.22">Tourism is a major growth industry internationally; however, uncontrolled promotion of tourism can have very undesirable environmental effects. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p21.22">Impacts are not just the obvious one such as traffic congestion mentioned in the political Impacts, but include the demand on water and sewerage infrastructure, energy use, the landscape and the air pollution. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p21.22">The number of tourism trips is estimated to be growing in the near future, but there is a serious concern about this prospect because such an increase would be unsustainable - particularly in the impacts of transport and water use. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p21.22">The challenge to the tourism industry is that the development of the industry is compatible with proper safeguarding of the special environment in both Oxford and Bath. </s>

<p n="p22.22">
<s n="s1.6;p22.22">Tourism is the world's largest industry and predicted to double in size in the next 20 years. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p22.22">It has the potential to bring major benefits to destinations, but can also be damaging to the people living there and to their environment. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p22.22">Oxford and Bath are two similar places, both are the famous destinations within the UK, as they are the historic cities and they contains thousands of treasures like cultures, histories, buildings etc. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p22.22">Although the tourism industry in Oxford and Bath is prosperous and brings with lots of economic benefits, there are still many problems like social and environmental issues which would affect both the tourists and the local residents. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p22.22">The government has imposed many policies in order to reduce the pressure on these issues, but simply writing a responsible tourism policy is no longer enough. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p22.22">It is a must to show practical action, so that the tourism destinations can become long lasting, and get more advantages in the industry without affecting the environment and local residents. </s>
