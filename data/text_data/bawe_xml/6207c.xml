<p n="p20.21">
<s n="s1.4;p20.21">the true thermodynamic solubility product of potassium periodate at room temperature was found to be approximately 2.718*10^-4 (this was the average value taken from our three solutions). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p20.21">It is this product which is said to be truly constant at any one temperature regardless of the environment as it takes into account the interactions between ions in solution. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p20.21">Our results strongly support this, deviating only very slightly from the mean, whereas the solubility product, ks, has a much greater standard deviation, varying for different solutions. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p20.21">It is important to note that our three solutions were filtered when at slightly different temperatures which may have led to the discrepancy in ksth. </s>
</p>
<p n="p21.21">
<s n="s1.4;p21.21">Our results also demonstrate very well the effects of both salting in and out as mentioned before. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p21.21">When other ions were introduced they reacted with the dissolved salt ions, removing them from the established equilibrium and hence forcing further generation (solubilization). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p21.21">This was illustrated by the rise in concentration of salt ions in solution B and demonstrates "salting in". </s>
<s n="s4.4;p21.21">Solution C introduced common ions which pushed the equilibrium towards the solid salt, lowering the concentration of iodate ions and hence the solubility decreased - an example of "salting out". </s>
