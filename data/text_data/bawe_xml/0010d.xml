<s n="s1.5;p1.12">The assumption that a gap existed between the theory and the practice in the social position of women between 1500 and 1700 is a contested one. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p1.12">Margaret Ezell argues that the expectations of female behaviour and duty in society did infact closely match the reality of women's experiences. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p1.12">Looking at contemporary literature and popular opinion, Ezell concludes that contrary to many historians who view the prescribed position as restrictive and misogynistic, both scripture and conduct books infact highlighted female capabilities and praised women as <hi rend="italic">partners</hi> in life. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p1.12">'Differences between men and women are merely superficial...women are as naturally capable as men of reason, wit and...government." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0010d-ftnote.001"/>
<s n="s5.5;p1.12">However, feminists have criticised Ezell for her limited interpretation of the literature she looks at.<ref target="BAWE_0010d-ftnote.002"/> They argue that advice such as '...it is not that the wife has no mind of her own, but that she deliberately alters it if necessary, to conform with her husbands,' does not counter the view that women were expected to be submissive and were considered inferior to men during this period.<ref target="BAWE_0010d-ftnote.003"/> Even Lawrence Stone, who argues that patriarchy was at its strongest and its most widely accepted at this time, acknowledges that the role set out for women often differed markedly from the actual experiences of womanhood, due mainly to the fact that the prescribed role was simply incompatible with the realities of life, especially for the poor.<ref target="BAWE_0010d-ftnote.004"/> Indeed, Ralph Houlbrooke argues that the '...theory was simply unworkable...' with the realities faced by contemporary women<ref target="BAWE_0010d-ftnote.005"/>. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p2.12">In this essay I am going to argue from a standpoint assuming that a gap between the theory and the practice in the social position of women in early modern England did infact exist. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p2.12">I will argue that this gap existed despite both male and female attempts to keep within it, due both to its unrealistic expectations compared with the actual lives women led, and the dualities and contradictions within it. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p2.12">I will argue that due to three broad and overlapping areas: economic and personal factors, and a contradiction within the role which expected servility but also demanded command and power, women could not live out their lives within the boundaries of their expected social positions. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.12">
<s n="s1.10;p3.12">The position women were to occupy in society was set out to the population through a number of mediums. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p3.12">Scriptural references in homilies and religious services put emphasis upon '...the procreation and religious education of children, the regulation of sexual activity, and mutual comfort and support.' </s>
<s n="s3.10;p3.12">A distinction was made between suitable female and male duties; 'The husband was held to be the superior partner, the wife the subordinate and inferior...her foremost duty was obedience." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0010d-ftnote.006"/>
<s n="s4.10;p3.12">In the advice guides published, women were seen to be 'material and passive...weak in body...and unfitted for work or public life.' </s>
<s n="s5.10;p3.12">As such they were expected to remain in the private sphere, '...unquestioningly obedient to her husband, accepting husbandly reproofs meekly...bearing her husbands faults...accommodating his various moods and on any breach being the first to seek reconciliation." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0010d-ftnote.007"/>
<s n="s6.10;p3.12">Satires and other anti-female publications played upon the popular images of women as sexually insatiable, nagging scolds, as well as playing upon the images of marriage as an end to freedom and fun, and a life of supporting a wife who would stop at nothing to get her own way.<ref target="BAWE_0010d-ftnote.008"/> Whether popular opinion about women was more influenced by religion and advice guides or by satires is hard to tell, and indeed the opinion of the female role and marriage differed between men and women and according to place in the social order.<ref target="BAWE_0010d-ftnote.009"/> It is probable that popular opinion took on board a mixture of both views as well as referring to personal experience of female figures and their behaviour. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p3.12">Finally, the expected social position of women was expressed by the authorities through the law; 'nowhere did the wife appear more completely subordinate to her husband than in the common law'.<ref target="BAWE_0010d-ftnote.010"/> Women were never a homogeneous group; the law and indeed general opinion differed with different women; single, married, widowed and spinsters. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p3.12">However, in the eyes of the law, a woman <hi rend="italic">belonged</hi> to the man in charge of her whether that was a father, brother or husband. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p3.12">Widows enjoyed a certain amount of freedom, however along with spinsters were so marginalised socially, for being 'master-less', and economically, with only a few poorly paid trades to work in, that they had very hard lives.<ref target="BAWE_0010d-ftnote.011"/> Already, with this simple description of the expected social position of women it is possible to see some of the contradictions within it; for example, that women were sexually uncontrollable, yet the moral guardians of society. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p3.12">Susan Amussen argues that this contradiction is one of the main reasons why the wish for '...clear subordination of wives to husbands...was never fully realised.'<ref target="BAWE_0010d-ftnote.012"/> </s>

<s n="s1.6;p4.12">The gap between theory and practice in the social position of women in early modern England was certainly influenced by the economic realities they faced in their everyday lives. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p4.12">It was often necessary for poorer women to marry quite late; the time before marriage was spent working in service adding to the family purse. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p4.12">Girls had to leave home and live away from their families often giving them a taste for relative freedom, economic independence and a knowledge of their personal capabilities. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p4.12">Even after marriage it was often necessary for women to make economic contributions to the family; supplementing the low wages her husband was paid. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p4.12">Keith Wrightson argues that these female supplements to male wages were crucial to survival even if they did somewhat undermine the official female position in society.<ref target="BAWE_0010d-ftnote.013"/> Susan Amussen points out that the gap between theory and practice actually lessened depending on the importance of the economic contributions of a wife.<ref target="BAWE_0010d-ftnote.014"/> Some women did not need to compromise the submissive, passive role by economic contributions such as bartering at market or looking after the estate whilst a husband was absent.<ref target="BAWE_0010d-ftnote.015"/> Although women rarely strayed in to their husbands' role once he had returned, it was essential to economic survival that they could and would perform his tasks even if this meant female and domination and authority. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p4.12">Men wanted their wives to be '...both subordinate and competent...and willing to accept that whatever a man did was work and whatever a woman did was her duty'.<ref target="BAWE_0010d-ftnote.016"/> 'Women's independence and autonomy were critical to their success as wives and mothers...the contradictions between women's economic roles and their expected subordination were so severe that they posed a problem to the most carefully conforming wife.'<ref target="BAWE_0010d-ftnote.017"/> </s>

<s n="s1.4;p5.12">Women were often needed in the public sphere, and even if not playing leading roles their actions still conflicted with the domesticated submission part of the role, although perhaps fulfilling the obedience part. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p5.12">Diane Willen argues that pauper women were actively recruited by local authorities in to the public arena.<ref target="BAWE_0010d-ftnote.018"/> Although the work women were doing for local authorities was an extension of their traditional domestic duties; cleaning and caring, 'it questions...the existence of separate private/public spheres in the early modern period'.<ref target="BAWE_0010d-ftnote.019"/> Both the poor women being employed and the 'local patriarchal political authorities' employing them gained economically from this arrangement.<ref target="BAWE_0010d-ftnote.020"/> Women could earn a small wage and authorities gained a willing, cheap labour force; both parties were forced to revise women's official social position for economic gain. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p5.12">Widows were also women with access to the public sphere; they could by law take over some of their husband's trades or estates upon his death. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p5.12">Although often poorer widows were left very economically vulnerable, some were able to maintain themselves successfully; indeed advice guides warned men against marrying widows as they tended to be 'harder to tame' having already tasted and achieved economic independence<ref target="BAWE_0010d-ftnote.021"/>. </s>

<s n="s3.7;p6.12">Love and caring were seen as very important aspects of a successful marriage, in particular they were seen as part of a husband's duty. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p6.12">However it was well documented in contemporary literature that '...more men betrayed their command through their own fondness than ever lost it through their wives rebellion'.<ref target="BAWE_0010d-ftnote.022"/> Though caring and affection were viewed with importance; and were often an unavoidable outcome of spending lives together, measures were taken to limit the influence affection had on the social position of women. </s>

<s n="s2.6;p7.12">The double standard which existed in terms of male and female sexual morality and the importance of reputation in early modern society made courting quite a difficult process. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p7.12">Women had to use their intricate knowledge of the laws of courting to avoid the many traps which could leave them tied to a poor marriage match or with their reputation in tatters. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p7.12">Often it was impossible for a woman to remain passive during courting, especially if conjugal rights had been granted to a man after the promise of marriage, or pushy parents were disdainful of certain suitors. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p7.12">Often with a little bit of courage and forcefulness, men could be made to keep promises, and by scrutinising the exact wording used in the making of a marriage contract they could be escaped. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p9.12">The final aspect which made it impossible for women to live wholly within their official social position, were the areas of society over which women had complete power and control; morality, reputation and of course the domestic sphere. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p9.12">In marriage and out of it women were to control the sexual activity of themselves and their spouses; adultery was seen as dangerous, putting the established social order in jeopardy, and even too much sex between husband and wife was viewed negatively.<ref target="BAWE_0010d-ftnote.028"/> Women's control over reputation gave them a certain amount of power over both other women and men; as Samuel Pepys diary shows '...when his wife caught him with their maid...he at once recognised the political significance of the event'.<ref target="BAWE_0010d-ftnote.029"/> Women could wield the reputation card to expand their limited role and position in society.<ref target="BAWE_0010d-ftnote.030"/> Gossiping was another largely female activity allowing them to channel pressure on those they felt were morally lacking whether for bastardy, cuckolding or wife beating.<ref target="BAWE_0010d-ftnote.031"/> Women were called upon to ensure that their men folk were satisfactorily carrying out their duties and this gave them a certain amount of power. </s>
