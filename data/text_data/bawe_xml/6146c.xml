<s n="s2.7;p3.54">The modernisation of the London Ambulance Service was essential, and the executive board saw a new CAD (computer aided dispatch) system as the prime means of improving these standards. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p3.54">This meant that the feasibility of this project did not really come up as an issue. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p3.54">Similar computer systems had already been implemented in other parts of the UK, such as Surrey, West Midlands, and Oxford, and also in police and fire services, showing that it was indeed possible. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p3.54">Hence, initial investigation focussed more on the shortcomings of the existing manual system. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p3.54">This gave the impression that CAD should be implemented as soon as possible, leading to hasty project planning, and an unrealistic time scale. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p3.54">The LAS management were fully aware that the project they were proposing was the most complex of its type, and perhaps should have been more tentative at issuing such a project, especially after the abandonment of a previous attempt. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p12.54">The initial aims for the new system were to eradicate these issues. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p12.54">A team was assembled involving the systems manager, a contract analyst, the control room manager, and representatives from training and communications, <hi rend="italic">but not from the ambulance crews</hi>. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p12.54">This might be the first reason why ambulance crews later "could not (or would not) use their MDTs (mobile data terminals)"- A.Finkelstein &amp; J.Dowell. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p12.54">Some involvement from ambulance crews or their union, could have expressed the need for simpler terminals that would not become confusing to frustrated crews under a lot of pressure. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p13.54">"the original specification for this system changed as the development project evolved." - </s>

</p>
<p n="p14.54">
<s n="s1.3;p14.54">Although it often necessary to adapt the requirements of a project, this indicates that the original specification was either unrealistic or badly devised. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p14.54">Careful research could have eliminated many of the problems encountered by the project. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p14.54">Corresponding with the personnel who would ultimately be running and working with the system would have highlighted the need for the system to be able to run in a semi-automated mode in the case of problems. </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.54">
<s n="s1.4;p15.54">Such a large failure as was experienced by the project implies that the requirements were not broken down into categories of essential, desirable, and less important. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p15.54">Or if they were, too many were described as essential, making the project too ambitious for the planned time scale. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p15.54">An important part of defining the requirements is determining whether they are realistic. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p15.54">More attention should have been paid to this process, since ultimately several important specifications were either not met, or even specified: </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p16.54">
<s n="s1.1;p16.54">Quality assurance - when implemented, the system could not handle the load of all the emergency calls. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p17.54">
<s n="s1.1;p17.54">Data - inadequate research was put into the amount of data that would need to be handled, otherwise the problem above would not have occurred. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p18.54">
<s n="s1.1;p18.54">Training - According to the inquiry report the training given to personnel was not comprehensive nor consistent, and "should be reviewed" - 3100 </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p19.54">
<s n="s1.1;p19.54">Deadlines - since the system had not fully lived up to its specifications, the deadlines should have been extended to ensure a safe implementation. </s>

<p n="p20.54">
<s n="s1.2;p20.54">LAS management boldly decided to produce a state of the art system which "no other emergency service, certainly in the UK, had attempted" - 3013. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p20.54">To move to this in one big changeover was appalling misjudgement. </s>

<head rend="bold">Design - 468 words</head>
<p n="p21.54">
<s n="s1.1;p21.54">The design stage also acts as validation of the requirements specification, yet amazingly, poorly defined specifications were not rectified at this stage. </s>
</p>
<p n="p22.54">
<s n="s1.3;p22.54">Firstly, "contact was made with other ambulance services... to determine whether or not their existing systems might be... extended to meet the LAS vision". </s>
<s n="s2.3;p22.54">All of these systems were rejected, and so the LAS system was designed from scratch, with no elements coming from an existing working implementation - another bold decision by the LAS management. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p22.54">The design included the following sub-systems: </s>
</p>
<list type="bulleted">
<item>CAD Software;</item>
<item>CAD Hardware;</item>
<item>RIFS Communication Interface;</item>
<item>radio system;</item>
<item>Datatrak Sub System;</item>

<item>Mobile Data Terminals.</item>
</list>
<p n="p23.54">
<s n="s1.5;p23.54">The technical design of the system was not undertaken by LAS, but contracted to bidding suppliers. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p23.54">There was no list of approved suppliers for systems, and so the cheapest option was taken. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p23.54">This cheapest option was to cost £937,463. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p23.54">Previously, Arthur Andersen (Management Consultants) had recommended a budget of £1.5m for a system which did not even include an AVLS! </s>
<s n="s5.5;p23.54">Much better guidance should have been available to the team procuring a system of such critical importance. </s>
</p>
<p n="p24.54">
<s n="s1.3;p24.54">The proposal "would require absolute co-operation from all parties" and "absolute confidence in the system... to work perfectly all of the time" - 3025. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p24.54">There was no scope to compensate for human errors, misjudgements, or incomplete or inaccurate information. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p24.54">The development team did not fully understand the importance that software, hardware and communications function perfectly at all times. </s>
</p>
<p n="p25.54">
<s n="s1.2;p25.54">The chosen suppliers were asked no questions about why their bid was so much cheaper than all the others. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p25.54">It eventually became obvious that they had massively underestimated the complexity of the requirement. </s>
</p>
<p n="p26.54">
<s n="s1.4;p26.54">LAS management were given advice that "if a packaged solution could be found... a timescale from specification to implementation of 19 months would be appropriate... if a package solution cannot be found then these estimates should be significantly increased" - 3036. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p26.54">They chose to ignore this advice, and selected hardware and software suppliers based on their ability to meet much shorter deadlines. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p26.54">The project was to go from specification to implementation in only 6 months. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p26.54">It can only be the case that the design stages were extremely rushed. </s>
</p>
<p n="p27.54">
<s n="s1.2;p27.54">At a LAS Board meeting in May 1991, "doubts are raised as to the ability of the communications system to cope with the potential load to be placed upon it, and of the reliability and state of readiness of the RIFS system." </s>
<s n="s2.2;p27.54">These two crucial concerns were dismissed, underlining the fact that there was very little technical evaluation of the proposed designs. </s>
</p>
<p n="p28.54">
<s n="s1.2;p28.54">Overall, the design of the system was inadequate, and the suppliers proposals were not looked over thoroughly enough by LAS management. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p28.54">It is essential that a design is checked to fit the specifications before it is implemented, especially in such a crucial scenario. </s>

<head rend="bold">Implementation - 217 words</head>
<p n="p29.54">
<s n="s1.3;p29.54">It is my belief that the CAD system should not have been implemented in one go. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p29.54">Rather, a basic system should have been put in place by the original deadline, and the full system gradually formed by steadily introducing new features (known as an iterative and incremental model). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p29.54">This was a solution that several suppliers suggested as a much better approach. </s>
</p>
<p n="p30.54">
<s n="s1.1;p30.54">One main benefit of this approach would have been the ability to gain feedback from the personnel who use the system (ambulance crews, call takers), before the system was too heavily developed and implanted to have elements changed. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p31.54">All three suppliers had trouble implementing their technology before the deadline. </s>

<s n="s3.6;p31.54">The physical installations also suffered problems, and there were instances of poor quality equipment installation by one subcontractor. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p31.54">"There was patchy resistance to the installation of Datatrak equipment in the vehicles. </s>

</p>
<p n="p32.54">
<s n="s1.3;p32.54">It should have been realised that the deadlines were unachievable. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p32.54">Instead, contractors were heavily pressured to meet them, and a partial solution was implemented in January 1992. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p32.54">From this time, several short term expedients were added in haste to allow the partial solution, and to keep the project showing positive progress. </s>

<s n="s2.3;p33.54">This statement states that testing did take place, but clearly the load testing was not effective. </s>

</p>
<p n="p34.54">
<s n="s1.3;p34.54">While each supplier tested their own hardware and software combinations, the system as a whole remained untested until it was put in place. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p34.54">The design should have been tested much more thoroughly, investigating the consequences of human errors, and system faults of many different types. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p34.54">There were many possibilities for failure, and the following should all have been investigated: </s>

<item>communications failures</item>
<item>exception messages or bugs in the software</item>
<item>the effect of a call back being required</item>

<item>knock on effects of faults</item>
<item>would the system be recoverable after a failure; how long would it take?</item>
<item>Did personnel know what their roles were to be, and how to use the technology?</item>

<s n="s1.2;p35.54">Shockingly, it seems that none of the above were tested. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p35.54">Rather, it was the implementation of the technologies later on which identified all the faults. </s>
</p>
<p n="p36.54">
<s n="s1.2;p36.54">While it is obviously preferable to have no faults at all, it is critical that no fault should cause the entire system to fail. </s>
