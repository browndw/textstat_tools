</p>
<p n="p3.16">
<s n="s1.3;p3.16">Governance, today, doesn't just include those, who as ministers, civil servants or elected councillors are part of government, it also involves a wide range of organisations, including former state institutions and activities, which have been privatised, central and local government departments but also quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisations (quangos), which are independent as they aren't part of government departments, nor directly accountable to ministers: finally, not forgetting the voluntary sector. </s>

<s n="s3.6;p4.16">An example of the different agencies that are involved in a public service could be the provision of local health services/care, which is now the main responsibility of hospital trusts and primary care trusts. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p5.16">In the UK there is a unitary rather than a federal state. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p5.16">Supreme power is not divided: it is concentrated in the hands of the central government, which causes problems as there is no longer direct contact between Central and Local Government and this is responsible for local decline of power. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p5.16">The role of local government is strictly subordinate and its relationship with central government is very unequal. </s>

<p n="p6.16">
<s n="s1.3;p6.16">The British state has been eroded by the European Union (EU) as it has been continuously increasing, its influence over British policy. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p6.16">This process began in 1973 when the United Kingdom joined the EU and as a result of this, decisions taken in Westminster and Whitehall are now controlled and revised by powers located in Brussels, Strasbourg and Luxemburg. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p6.16">Other super-national bodies have an influence also, as well as by the power of global capitalism and devolution, decentralisation and fragmentation, which adds to the levels in governance. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p8.16">The English Local Government Act 2000 changed the formal management of local democracy in England, the most radical change being directly-elected mayors (or the mayor and cabinet option), which was adopted in only a small number of towns and cities. </s>

<s n="s3.4;p9.16">The mayor, in the UK, does not have direct sway over the administration of the council, which remains independently headed by a non-political official, usually called the chief executive, appointed by the whole of the council. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p9.16">The introduction of a directly-elected mayor is a significant constitutional change as the Government believe all local people should be able to have their say before a council adopts a constitution involving a directly elected mayor. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.16">
<s n="s1.1;p10.16">The new third way management is also significant: it involves networks and partnership rather than the traditional public administration associated with hierarchy, bureaucracy, command and compliance on the one hand or the new right solution of competition, consumer choice and markets on the other. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.16">
<s n="s1.5;p11.16">Recent reforms of structure, along with changes in operational responsibilities have increased public confusion over responsibility for local services and decisions. </s>

<s n="s2.8;p14.16">Planning stretches across a range of governmental levels but also non-governmental organisations, as part of governance. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p14.16">The UK planning system is intended to provide guidance, control and incentive in the use and development of land. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p14.16">The current form of national advice for planning, in England, is contained within a series of national planning policy guidance notes (PPGs). </s>

<s n="s6.8;p14.16">Central government's policy requirement is very clear: local planning authorities must follow the statements within PPGs with reference to carrying out their planning duties. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p14.16">The planning polity now comprises at least four different systems within the four different countries of the UK. Britain still possesses a UK government and policies are formulated within the UK government on certain topics for application across the whole of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p14.16">When it comes to planning decisions they are delegated to planning officers then the Local Area Committee (LAC) before being passed onto the strategic development Control Committee and finally the Local Plan is referred to. </s>

<s n="s2.7;p15.16">The Mailbox is a prime example of this. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p15.16">The building is that of an old Royal Mail sorting office with one of the cities canals running alongside, which was bought by the local government for redevelopment. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p15.16">The new mixed-use building opened just prior to Christmas 2000 and consists of designer shops, restaurants and café bars along with two new hotels and luxury apartments. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p15.16">The upper levels also provide office and residential accommodation. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p15.16">This process of redevelopment involved Royal Mail, the local government, British Waterway's, private investors, such as residential and retail owners and developers. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p15.16">The actual transformation by the business involved many businesses, reflecting local governance. </s>

<p n="p16.16">
<s n="s1.5;p16.16">In Oxford the Planning Department formulates recommended goals, plans, policies and ordinances that provide orderly growth and development for the city. </s>
