<s n="s5.6;p1.44">The software is not sold - instead, companies are required to pay a monthly fee of currently 5Â£ per user for access to the service running on Signifo's servers. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p1.44">This constitutes the unique selling point of their solution - being accessible worldwide and not necessitating a software package to be bought, installed and maintained. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p19.44">When serving large companies, Signifo will have to face a much more significant <hi rend="bold">bargaining power</hi>, meaning they will have to offer them discounts and additional services, and, as Mr Brewis (managing director) acknowledges, "invest in a field-based sales team". </s>

<s n="s4.4;p40.44">This way, the company has more time to train a sales team of its own, which is unavoidable in the medium term. </s>
</p>
<p n="p41.44">
<s n="s1.3;p41.44">This concept works well in conjunction with the product licensing scheme proposed by management, because companies experienced in potential markets complement Signifo's strengths. </s>
