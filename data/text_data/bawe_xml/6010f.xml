<head rend="bold">2. History. </head>
<p n="p2.52">
<s n="s1.2;p2.52">Pattern grammar can be seen as a description of language which treats lexis and grammar as a single item (Hunston &amp; Francis, 1998). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p2.52">Traditionally these areas have been treated separately but corpus based research has highlighted that patterns may be shown for all words and that where these patterns occur meaning is shared (Hunston et al., 1997). </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.52">
<s n="s1.4;p3.52">The concept of pattern grammar may be traced back to Hornby's <hi rend="italic">A Guide to Patterns and Usage in English</hi> first published in 1954 (Hunston &amp; Francis, 2000). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p3.52">In his work Hornby (1954) focussed on usage and as a result reported on patterns of usage rather than on formal structure. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p3.52">His ideas contrasted with those of Chomsky in the 1950s whose theory of a transformational-generative grammar treated lexis and grammar as separate items. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p3.52">Hunston &amp; Francis (2000:7) point out that during the1970s studies of language changed emphasis and work focussed on lexis as the central principle. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.52">
<s n="s1.1;p4.52">More recently the disciplines of lexicography, pedagogy, and psycholinguistics have concerned themselves with research into lexical phrases which has added to the perception of language as phraseological. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.52">
<s n="s1.3;p5.52">A problem for lexicographers when compiling dictionaries has been how to list lexical phrases, particularly idioms, which do not necessarily follow the normal rules of syntax. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p5.52">For example; <hi rend="italic">He stole a march on...</hi> </s>
<s n="s3.3;p5.52">not <hi rend="italic">the march was stolen by him</hi> or <hi rend="italic"> they stole some marches.</hi> </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.52">
<s n="s1.3;p6.52">The meaning of the idiom cannot be determined by knowledge of meaning of each item. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p6.52">Other lexical phrases not considered idioms present similar problems for listing. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p6.52">
<hi rend="italic">Of course</hi> and <hi rend="italic"> in the main,</hi> cannot be broken down into preposition and noun because this does not convey their meaning. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.52">
<s n="s1.1;p7.52">Language teachers have confronted the problem for learners of fluency where knowledge of lexical phrases can make their language sound more natural and allow the learner to concentrate on other areas. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.52">
<s n="s1.1;p8.52">For psycholinguists the interest has been in how users store and retrieve language and their research has suggested that users store language not just as single items but in phrases as well as with syntactic rules allowing for creative use of both (Hunston &amp; Francis, 2000). </s>

<head rend="bold">3. Theories and Principles</head>
<p n="p9.52">
<s n="s1.1;p9.52">It is within this historical background that Sinclair (1991) put forward his theory of 'units of meaning' which illustrates that lexical items need to be viewed in their environment in order to convey meaning. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.52">
<s n="s1.2;p10.52">Corpus linguistics, as the methodology which provided the development of this theory, works on several principles which differ from previous methodologies of language description. </s>

</p>
<p n="p12.52">
<s n="s1.1;p12.52">To study how language is used it is necessary to observe language actually used. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p13.52">
<s n="s1.1;p13.52">the data is not selected on linguistic grounds </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.52">
<s n="s1.1;p14.52">When a particular feature of English is chosen for study it is often chosen because it stands out in some way and so is indicative of the unusual not the common usage of language. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p15.52">
<s n="s1.1;p15.52">there is a lot of data </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.52">
<s n="s1.2;p16.52">The larger a corpus is the more detail may be discovered about less frequent items. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p16.52">This principle is based on what Sinclair (1991:100) says about <hi rend="italic"> 'the accumulation of patterns of hundreds of individual words and phrases'</hi> which are evidenced only by observing large amounts of data. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p17.52">
<s n="s1.1;p17.52">the data is systematically organised </s>
</p>
<p n="p18.52">
<s n="s1.1;p18.52">Data needs to be presented in a way that allows observation while maintaining objectivity as much as is possible where the nature of the system requires categorisation. </s>

<s n="s1.1;p21.52">These principles can now be investigated with Kennedy's (1998:10) observation in mind; '<hi rend="italic">The major shift in methodology associated with corpus linguistics comes not from theory but rather from what the use of corpora makes possible.' </hi> </s>

<head rend="bold">4.1 Concordance lines</head>
<p n="p22.52">
<s n="s1.2;p22.52">How the use of corpora is made possible then is in the methodology of first finding and then interpreting concordance lines. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p22.52">A concordancer is not a corpus - it is a computer programme used to search a corpus which displays information in different ways for interpretation. </s>

<p n="p23.52">

<s n="s2.2;p33.52">Hunston (2002) makes a distinction here saying that a word-based approach and a category-based approach answer different questions so must be applied at different times. </s>

<head rend="bold">5. Principles of language choice</head>
<p n="p41.52">
<s n="s1.1;p41.52">The corpus evidence presented above serves to highlight how corpus-based descriptions of language have provided important observations into the connection between pattern and meaning. </s>
</p>
<p n="p42.52">
<s n="s1.1;p42.52">Having looked at this evidence it may be helpful to consider two principles of language choice available to the English speaker characterised by Sinclair (1991:109). </s>
</p>
<p n="p43.52">
<s n="s1.2;p43.52">The first is the open choice principle which allows that the only restriction on choice is grammaticalness. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p43.52">That is; language choice is based on a user's ability to convey meaning by the application of grammatical rules combined with individual lexical items. </s>
</p>
<p n="p44.52">
<s n="s1.3;p44.52">The second principle, the idiom principle, allows for the choice of semi pre-constructed sequences and recognises the tendency of associations in the world around us to be reflected in the same tendencies of association in language. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p44.52">Kennedy (1998:110) examples <hi rend="italic">ice</hi> and <hi rend="italic">cold, cry</hi> and <hi rend="italic">tears, noise</hi> and <hi rend="italic">loud/soft</hi> as words which co-occur and may be a reflection of nature. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p44.52">The idiom principle also relates to semi pre-constructed phrases which could be seen as a single choice such as <hi rend="italic">of course</hi> or <hi rend="italic"> at least.</hi> </s>
</p>
<p n="p45.52">
<s n="s1.3;p45.52">Sinclair (2004) makes the point that most usage lies somewhere between the two principles with some patterns tending towards open choice and some toward idiomaticity. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p45.52">He further defines these tendencies as 'terminological' (open choice) and 'phraseological' (idiomatic). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p45.52">The first where a word has a fixed meaning and the second where words take their meaning from each other. </s>

<head rend="bold">6. Pattern and meaning</head>
<p n="p46.52">
<s n="s1.5;p46.52">Hunston and Francis (2000) demonstrate that lists of words which have a specific pattern tend to fit into groups supplying meaning. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p46.52">They example the pattern <hi rend="italic">verb + of + noun</hi> (2000:83) with a list of 32 verbs taken from the Collins COBUILD English Dictionary. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p46.52">Those verbs include; <hi rend="italic">approve, disapprove, despair, repent, boast, complain, speak, talk, tell.</hi> </s>
<s n="s4.5;p46.52">Taking just these nine verbs it is possible to see how they may be grouped according to meaning. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p46.52">The last three <hi rend="italic">speak, talk, tell,</hi> all mean <hi rend="italic">talk about</hi> and the first two mean <hi rend="italic">like</hi> or the opposite. </s>
</p>
<p n="p47.52">
<s n="s1.1;p47.52">Linking pattern to meaning by division into groups in this way relies heavily on intuition but it does help to identify probabilities rather than rules and also shows that patterns are not arbitrary but are associated with meaning. </s>
</p>
<p n="p48.52">
<s n="s1.5;p48.52">This association though is not predictive. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p48.52">How is the boundary determined between <hi rend="italic">of</hi> as a single lexical item and <hi rend="italic">of</hi> as part of a phrase? </s>
<s n="s3.5;p48.52">O <hi rend="italic">f</hi> cannot remain independent, it must be part of a pattern to convey meaning and the more often it is used in a pattern the more distinctive its meaning becomes. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p48.52">While <hi rend="italic">of</hi> appears in the pattern above (<hi rend="italic">verb + of + noun)</hi> it cannot be said to be fixed because the words of the pattern are variable and determine the meaning <hi rend="italic">of</hi> is to convey. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p48.52">So </s>
</p>
<p n="p49.52">
<s n="s1.2;p49.52">in phrases like <hi rend="italic">to disapprove of smoking</hi> and <hi rend="italic">to speak of the devil</hi>, where <hi rend="italic">of</hi> is used in the same way it has a different meaning than in <hi rend="italic">of course</hi> which is actually a single item using two words (Sinclair 2004). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p49.52">This sort of distinction is not made clear in conventional grammar because many everyday words do not have independent meaning. </s>
</p>
<p n="p50.52">
<s n="s1.2;p50.52">Further, as speakers use unusual words in a pattern because they resemble other words used in that pattern, that is, by analogy with a more typical word, any pattern is subject to variation so that while it may be said that a certain group of words occur in a certain pattern it cannot be said that they are the only ones to occur in that pattern (Hunston &amp; Francis 2000). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p50.52">This allows for the creativity involved in language use without which speakers would choose the same words in every circumstance, always saying, for example, <hi rend="italic">I talked him into doing it</hi> and never <hi rend="italic">I cajoled him into doing it.</hi> </s>

<s n="s4.5;p52.52">The function performed by pattern grammar in showing how language works is useful for the development of fluency and accuracy for learners of English by helping to provide communicative competence, that is, a persons knowledge of a language and their ability to put that knowledge to use. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p52.52">By providing detail of the behaviour of lexical items a corpus-based description of English may help to provide a new theory of language with implications for lexicography, pedagogy, and psycholinguistics, in fact all areas which focus on language in use. </s>
