<s n="s1.5;p1.12">The railroad narrative of progress had a number of similarities which it shared with the axe and mill narratives, but there were far more differences. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p1.12">To an extent, the railroad narrative was seen as merely an extension of the previous narratives in that it allowed man to triumph over nature, the only difference being that more developed technology was involved in the process. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p1.12">However, this difference must not be underestimated as it had a major impact on the landscape as well as on the economic and political climate. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p1.12">Power was concentrated in the hands of a few corporations rather than the individual, which created many problems for the railroad workers; huge cities were built rather than villages and towns; the destruction of the environment was on a far greater scale; there were numerous accidents associated with the railroads and finally the actual railroad workers had poor reputations unlike those involved in the axe and mill narratives. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p1.12">This essay will compare the railroad narrative to the two which came before it, the axe and the mill narratives, and conclude that there were a far greater number of differences than there were similarities. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.12">
<s n="s1.6;p2.12">Like the axe and mill narratives, the railroad narrative was seen as beneficial to the United States as it helped to 'unify, dignify, expand and enrich the nation'.<ref target="BAWE_0029p-ftnote.001"/> It was seen as being able to bind the nation together politically and economically: 'the construction of transport links became the equivalent of constructing the nation itself, in a process that could be seen epitomized in the growth of commerce and the establishment of new towns'.<ref target="BAWE_0029p-ftnote.002"/> Between 1830 and the end of the century the railroad had expanded from a few miles of track to become absolutely vital to American life and commerce. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p2.12">The railroad linked the individual's actions to those of the national market. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p2.12">'The settlement of the West and the building of the railroad system could thus be understood as a natural process in which the American people... overflowed their banks and surged into a new region. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p2.12">Expansion seemed a partnership between man and nature, ordained by the creator'.<ref target="BAWE_0029p-ftnote.003"/> Settlement and progress were seen as railroad creations. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p2.12">The railroad was playing a central role in westward expansion, of which there seemed to be a certain sense of inevitability. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p2.12">The railroad was seamlessly integrated into both the national identity and the national economy. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p3.12">Its technology was seen as being especially valuable as 'the railroad seemed the most obvious example of a liberating machine'.<ref target="BAWE_0029p-ftnote.004"/> This was similar to the mill and axe narratives which had also lightened the workload of humans. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p3.12">'The railroad company entered an undeveloped region and used its powerful technology to transform it, creating new towns and bringing new settlers'<ref target="BAWE_0029p-ftnote.005"/>, as was also the case with the axe and mill narratives. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p3.12">Americans often sought to integrate both nature and industrialization. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p3.12">The fact that the 'railroad was regarded as an engine of progress'<ref target="BAWE_0029p-ftnote.006"/> means that it was inherently similar to the axe and mill narratives of progress in terms of its ultimate aims, despite it being far more technologically advanced. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p3.12">This was because many Americans, such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, preferred to see the railroad as an extension of nature rather than a corruption of it. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p3.12">Logically, the railroad could not pass through an area which had not already been cleared by an axe. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p3.12">Thus, the railroad narrative was embraced into the American ideal based on its intentions, the spread of progress to the American people, despite its technological dominance compared to the axe and mill narratives. </s>

<s n="s2.8;p4.12">The railroad's huge sphere of influence was undoubtedly the most significant distinction: 'Whereas the narrative of the axe concerned solitary individuals, and the narrative of the mill described the emergence of towns, the foundation [narrative] of the... railroad projected new cities and massive growth for entire regions." </s>

<s n="s5.8;p4.12">The railroad produced a very systematic development of towns. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p4.12">However, 'The very ease with which cities might rise at the side of the railroad suggested their fundamental instability and weak social fabric." </s>

<s n="s7.8;p4.12">Many grew rapidly for ten years but then stagnated. </s>

<p n="p5.12">
<s n="s1.10;p5.12">The construction of the railroad also led to new forms of economic and political power which were not associated with the mill and axe narratives. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p5.12">State and local authorities often found it tremendously difficult to control railroad corporations: 'From 1850 to 1870, railroads were given land... by the federal government. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p5.12">In all, government gave 131 million acres of land to the railroads, most of which they later sold for $7 - $10 per acre'<ref target="BAWE_0029p-ftnote.009"/> thus making huge profits. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p5.12">In fact, the railroad companies often kept the land for many years, waiting for it to increase in value before selling it on at high prices. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p5.12">They were often attacked for wielding too much economic power. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p5.12">The axe and mill narratives had nothing that could even remotely compare with this. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p5.12">The railroad companies were seen as monopolies controlling western development rather than opening up the West to the common man. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p5.12">Those who lived in the towns created by the railroads often felt controlled by the companies. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p5.12">This can be seen in the citizens' support for the striking railroad workers in the late nineteenth century. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p5.12">They disliked the railroads' monopoly of their towns as well as the railroad crossings which were a danger to their safety. </s>

<s n="s4.9;p6.12">The mill narrative, it cannot be denied, ultimately had private aims. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p6.12">However, its proponents were far less monopolizing than those of the railroad whose control reached epic proportions: 'The power of the railroad began to resemble that of an absolute monarch." </s>

<s n="s1.4;p12.12">Therefore, in conclusion, although the railroad narrative of progress was similar to the axe and mill narratives in terms of its ultimate aim (the triumph of man over nature), there were far more differences when comparing the various narratives. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p12.12">Some of these differences included the development of cities rather than towns or villages, the perception of the railroad workers, the hugely damaging environmental effects, a large number of accidents and deaths caused by the railroad and the problems that the workers faced due to the enormous control that the railroad corporations held, which was undoubtedly the most significant difference. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p12.12">The immense power that the railroad corporations exhibited can best be summarized by the fact that the railroad was the 'largest business in the United States, the most powerful technical system, the fastest and most convenient form of transportation, and a state and national political force." </s>

<s n="s4.4;p12.12">One could certainly not describe the influence of the axe or the mill in this way. </s>
