<hi rend="bold italic">Laura, a 19 year old law student, went to the Rotten Row Bus Station to catch a coach home to Sweet Valley. She had made this journey from time to time in the past. Above the ticket-office window of the Slowe and Wheezy Bus Company was a sign which stated that all tickets were issued subject to conditions displayed inside the coaches. Laura purchased a ticket which made no reference to any conditions.</hi> <hi rend="bold italic"> While boarding the coach the driver carelessly knocked Laura's very expensive 'up to the minute' mobile phone from her hand and broke it.</hi> <hi rend="bold italic"> One of the terms displayed inside the coach was as follows:</hi>
<hi rend="italic"> Passengers travel with goods at their own risk. Neither the company nor its servants accept any liability for damage or loss to passengers' goods. The company's servants are parties to this contract.</hi> <hi rend="bold italic"> Advise Laura. In your advice state the effects of relevant case law and statutes. </hi>
