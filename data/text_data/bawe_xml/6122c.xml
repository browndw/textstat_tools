<head rend="underlined bold">Discussion of results. </head>
<p n="p39.47">
<s n="s1.4;p39.47">With the regards to the value of fat % w/w, for soxhlet extraction method it is 7.48 w/w% while for acid extraction it is 2.332 w/w%. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p39.47">For soxhlet extraction solvent used was petroleum ether of which it has a characteristic of not being affected by traces of moisture that may be present in the material before extracted and doesn't take up moisture during extraction. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p39.47">Also it doesn't extract non fat constituents such as starch and protein. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p39.47">While for acid extraction diethyl ether and petroleum ether were used, but diethyl ether it's a better solvent for fat than petroleum ether though its disadvantage it must be specifically freed from water and alcohol and kept so during determination, since moist will either dissolve the sugars and other materials which shouldn't be included in the true ether extract. </s>
</p>
<p n="p40.47">
<s n="s1.1;p40.47">Due to this reason its mostly likely during acid extraction water and alcohol hasn't all been freed during determination of fat, this also can be explained by the fact that time chosen within the practical was 1.5hours while in proper procedure is to extract for 4 hours, so there was a great chances on not removing all water and alcohol. </s>
</p>
<p n="p41.47">
<s n="s1.4;p41.47">According to the literature with regards to Association of Public Analysts (APA), have issued guidance on recommended fat level for minced beef. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p41.47">APA advices that any minced lean beef should contain not more than 16% total fat. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p41.47">For extra super/lean minced beef, guidance advises maximum of 9% fat. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p41.47">However public analyst have applied a maximum limit of 25% fat for standard minced beef which is widely established in case law. </s>
</p>
<p n="p42.47">
<s n="s1.2;p42.47">With the values from soxhlet and acid extraction, they were below 9% fat (soxhlet 7.4% fat and acid extraction 2.3% fat). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p42.47">With regards to APA guidance, minced beef sample used during experiment can be regarded as it was extra super/lean minced beef.. </s>
</p>
<p n="p43.47">
<s n="s1.2;p43.47">From literature, full fat milk contains not less than 3.0% fat milk, semi skimmed milk 15% to 1.8% and skimmed milk with a fat content of not more than 0.3%. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p43.47">From the results full fat milk had 4.2% while skimmed milk had 1.65%, this shows that the values for full fat milk was greater than or not less than 3% which was in accordance with the standard and for the skimmed milk was 1.65% of which, with regards with legislation and standards it can be as it was semi skimmed milk. </s>
</p>
<p n="p44.47">
<s n="s1.6;p44.47">Since fat has a lower specific gravity and therefore is "lighter" than the milk serum, fat globules rise to the milk surface. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p44.47">Then, fat can be collected or skimmed from the milk. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p44.47">The fat thus collected is called "cream" and the milk deprived of fat is called "skimmed milk "or "skim milk". </s>
<s n="s4.6;p44.47">As the lighter milk fat rises to the surface, the density changes. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p44.47">As you go towards the surface it creates layers of decreasing density. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p44.47">When milk is left to stand long enough, some separation will occur because of density differences. </s>

<head rend="underlined bold">CONCLUSIONS</head>
<p n="p45.47">
<s n="s1.3;p45.47">Soxhlet extraction is an accepted technique for extracting fat from meat samples. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p45.47">Though it is simple and robust, there are drawbacks to Soxhlet extraction, such as long drying and extraction times, lack of automation, and the amount of solvent used per sample. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p45.47">Associated error with the method, solvent should be heated so that it boils vigorously and steadily, but the temperature of the heating medium should be as low as possible to minimize decomposition of the extracted solutes and reduce loss of solvent. </s>
</p>
<p n="p46.47">
<s n="s1.6;p46.47">With respect to the choice of the solvent, extraction of the food material is ordinary made with either anhydrous ethyl ether or petroleum ether. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p46.47">Petroleum ether its advantage it is cheaper and requires no special reparation beyond possible fractionation to secure material boiling within the desired limits. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p46.47">Its has advantage of not being affected by traces of moisture that may be present in the material before extracted and doesn't take up moisture during extraction. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p46.47">It doesn't extract non fat constituents such as starch and protein. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p46.47">While ethyl ether it's a better solvent for fat than petroleum ether but its disadvantage it must be specifically freed from water and alcohol and kept so during determination, since moist will either dissolve the sugars and other materials which shouldn't be included in the true ether extract. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p46.47">Other disadvantage of soxhlet extraction its long time involved, large volumes of solvents, hazards of boiling solvents. </s>
</p>
<p n="p47.47">
<s n="s1.4;p47.47">The Gerber method is used worldwide as a simple and rapid method for determining fat in raw and processed milks. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p47.47">However, the volume of the test portion used in the method has not been internationally agreed upon. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p47.47">Commercially fat is the most important constituent of milk, as it is the factor on which pricing of milk is made. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p47.47">Gerber method is based on the principle of measuring the volume of fat released from a known volume of the milk sample upon rotation/centrifugation in a specially devised and accurately calibrated modified form of glass apparatus, called butyrometer. </s>
