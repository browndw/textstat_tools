<s n="s1.5;p1.51">At the end of the 20th century, there were wide discussions across India as to what was the biggest achievement for India as a country in the 20th century. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p1.51">India winning Independence and crossing $100 billion in foreign exchange (forex) reserves were touted as the two biggest achievements. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p1.51">The buildup of foreign exchange reserves has been one of the major milestones on the Indian economic scenario .Reserve accumulation was the buzzword of the late 1990s for most of the Asian economies. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p1.51">Increasing financial integration in global markets has meant that the risks involved with capital outflows have multiplied. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p1.51">Foreign exchange reserves are considered as insurance in times of crisis and go a long way towards building confidence in the financial system. </s>

<p n="p2.51">
<s n="s1.2;p2.51">India was a relatively closed economy until 1991 and has gradually been opening its economic frontiers since then. </s>

<p n="p3.51">
<s n="s1.3;p3.51">The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) should be given the credit for helping India to find itself in a strong position with regards to forex reserves. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p3.51">But the RBI now had a new ern, the policymakers were questioning whether these reserves had grown in excess to what they were required to be and serious thoughts were raised about using these forex reserves for the well being and development of the economy. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p3.51">My research paper is a quest towards understanding the forex reserves position and the possible uses of forex reserves from a blend of options available to the Indian policy makers in handling these reserves. </s>

<head>DEFINITION OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESERVES (BY IMF IN 1993):</head>
<p n="p4.51">
<s n="s1.1;p4.51">The International Monetary Fund's (IMF) Balance of Payments Manual (1993) defines foreign exchange reserves as: "Those external assets that are readily available to and controlled by monetary authorities for direct financing of payments imbalances, for indirectly regulating the magnitude of such imbalances through intervention in exchange markets to affect the currency exchange rate, and/or for other purposes" (IMF, 1993). </s>

<s n="s2.3;p11.51">Since 1991-92, India has made significant improvement in terms of raising this ratio. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p11.51">The import cover of reserves in 2005 was stretched to around 17 months of imports, and that is the highest-level ever recorded in Indian economic history (International Financial Statistics, Budget reports). </s>

<s n="s3.4;p14.51">In order to do this, the demand for reserves is measured by monetary authorities as existing reserve base plus an increase over time, which is accounted as a growth factor. </s>
