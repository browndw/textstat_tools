<s n="s3.4;p1.25">However, after been a vastly researched topic from the mid 1950s to the late 1960s, the surprising loss of interest in the field until the late 1980s was unfortunate. </s>

<p n="p2.25">
<s n="s1.5;p2.25">In this paper I will present some of these results and different theories, including an interpretation of the different econometric tools used to test for the relevant economic theories. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p2.25">My starting hypothesis is that initial GDP is significant in explaining economic growth, that is to say that a poor country grows faster than a rich and well developed country. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p2.25">This is consistent with Solow's theory of convergence; that poor countries will exhibit a higher growth rate and eventually catch up with the richer countries. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p2.25">However, I will not use the original Solow model as a reference in this paper, but rather the augmented version of the model as found in Mankiw, Romer and Weil's paper on the empirics of economic growth<ref target="BAWE_0077f-ftnote.001"/>. </s>

<s n="s2.4;p4.25">However, disregarding a few attempts to integrate Keynesian analysis with elements of economic growth<ref target="BAWE_0077f-ftnote.006"/>, the next and more important contributions were those of Solow and Swan<ref target="BAWE_0077f-ftnote.007"/>. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p4.25">In his classic 1956 article "A Contribution to the Theory of Economic Growth" in the Quarterly Journal of Economics<ref target="BAWE_0077f-ftnote.008"/> Solow proposed that economic growth can be explained by a standard neoclassical production function with decreasing returns to capital and labour. </s>

<s n="s1.19;p7.25">A prediction from this model is conditional convergence. </s>
<s n="s2.19;p7.25">The lower the starting level of GDP (the <hi rend="italic">InitialGDP</hi> variable included in our regression), relative to the steady-state position, the faster the growth rate. </s>
<s n="s3.19;p7.25">This property of the Solow-model is derived directly from the assumption of diminishing returns to capital; economies that have less capital per worker tend to have higher rates of return and higher growth rates. </s>
<s n="s4.19;p7.25">The conditional convergence hypothesis says that per capita incomes of countries that are identical in their structural characteristics converge to one another independently of their initial conditions (<hi rend="italic">InitialGDP</hi>). </s>
<s n="s5.19;p7.25">Supporting evidence is found in several articles<ref target="BAWE_0077f-ftnote.010"/>. </s>
<s n="s6.19;p7.25">It is worth mentioning, however, that this supporting evidence is to a large extent consistent with the club convergence hypothesis as well. </s>
<s n="s7.19;p7.25">The club convergence hypothesis requires that the initial conditions are similar too, whereas absolute convergence is the case where countries converge to one another independently of both initial conditions and structural characteristics. </s>
<s n="s8.19;p7.25">Barro and Sala-i-Martin studied the behaviour of US states since 1880, regions of Japan since 1930 and eight European countries since 1950<ref target="BAWE_0077f-ftnote.011"/>. </s>
<s n="s9.19;p7.25">Regressions showed a significant negative correlation between growth rates and initial GDP. This result is consistent with the Solow model. </s>
<s n="s10.19;p7.25">The speed of the convergence across the data sets is also surprisingly similar. </s>
<s n="s11.19;p7.25">The convergence coefficient is around 2-3 percent per year, which implies that it takes 25-35 years to eliminate one-half of an initial gap in per capita incomes. </s>
<s n="s12.19;p7.25">This evidence is consistent with the Solow model with a capital share (α) of around three-quarters<ref target="BAWE_0077f-ftnote.012"/>. </s>
<s n="s13.19;p7.25">It is important to keep in mind that the study is done on countries with relative similar structural characteristics. </s>
<s n="s14.19;p7.25">One of the first studies on convergence, by Baumol, included a sample of 16 industrialised countries and found evidence of perfect convergence<ref target="BAWE_0077f-ftnote.013"/>. </s>
<s n="s15.19;p7.25">However, De Long revised the regression properties due to what he argued was bias and measurement errors and found that there exists practically no convergence<ref target="BAWE_0077f-ftnote.014"/>. </s>
<s n="s16.19;p7.25">Many cross-sectional studies provide evidence of conditional convergence, but by closer examination one still finds a growing divergence between the rich and poor countries in the world. </s>
<s n="s17.19;p7.25">An example of this is provided by Kremer who discovered absolute divergence in the majority of developing economies<ref target="BAWE_0077f-ftnote.015"/>. </s>
<s n="s18.19;p7.25">Romer also shows that the average growth rate of the richest countries by far exceeds the poorest ones<ref target="BAWE_0077f-ftnote.016"/>. </s>
<s n="s19.19;p7.25">Mankiw<ref target="BAWE_0077f-ftnote.017"/> finds no evidence of convergence in his cross-sectional study of 102 countries (Graph 2, left), however, when estimating a regression for the OECD countries convergence as indicated by the Solow model is apparent: </s>

<s n="s1.4;p22.25">The objective of this paper was to empirically test the theoretical growth models and specifically the determinants of economic growth. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p22.25">I chose the augmented Solow model as a reference for determining the factors that affect economic growth, and included the explanatory variables <hi rend="italic">InitialGDP</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Investment</hi> and <hi rend="italic">HumanCapital</hi> (by using secondary school enrolment as a proxy) in my dataset. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p22.25">The sample included 54 countries from the whole world, and the time period chosen was from 1994 to 2000. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p22.25">Although it might have been interesting to extend the time span in my cross-sectional dataset, I presumably still avoid the effect of business cycles by choosing a time period of seven years. </s>
</p>
<p n="p23.25">
<s n="s1.3;p23.25">For my estimated equation I obtained significant and positive coefficients for both human capital investment and investment, implying that these determinants of economic growth should be taken into account in policy contemplations. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p23.25">However, I did not find any significant evidence for my null hypothesis of convergence in the sample, as the coefficient on initial GDP was negative but not significant. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p23.25">Even when testing for conditional and club convergence with only the OECD countries included in the estimated equation there was no empirical support of economic convergence theory. </s>
</p>
<p n="p24.25">
<s n="s1.3;p24.25">When including a slope dummy variable in my estimated equation I obtained an interesting feature. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p24.25">With my cross-sectional dataset there was significant evidence that one percentage-point more investment in poor countries is more efficient than in rich countries, that is, it gives a higher rate of growth of real GDP per capita. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p24.25">The supportive evidence of human capital investment as an important determinant of economic growth has also central policy implications as discussed earlier. </s>
</p>
<p n="p25.25">
<s n="s1.1;p25.25">To summarise, the empirical evidence in this paper suggests that the explanatory variables <hi rend="italic">Investment</hi>, <hi rend="italic">HumanCapital</hi> and <hi rend="italic">InitialGDP</hi> is jointly significant in determining economic growth as measured by the growth rate of real GDP per capita. </s>
