<s n="s1.8;p1.23">'Race' and ethnicity are both terms used commonly within contemporary society, but their definitions and history sets them apart. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p1.23">The term 'race' has a long history steeped in hierarchy and inequality, whilst ethnicity, being a relatively new term, does not have this misfortune. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p1.23">'Race' thinking, often leads to racism, and its concentration on phenotypical attributes and physical difference causes people to not look at commonalities, but at difference. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p1.23">'Race' was used to justify slavery and colonialism, and 'race-science' did this by assuming natural differences, leading to eugenics, which caused the working-class 'race' to be controlled. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p1.23">Ethnicity does not have this history but whether the two terms are the same depends on how ethnicity is defined. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p1.23">There is not one single definition for ethnicity; is it a fixed, static, ascribed (primordial) role (like 'race') or is it contextual and constantly in flux? </s>
<s n="s7.8;p1.23">Commonsense thinking, often use the two terms interchangeably, with little differentiation between them (also seen in the confused terminology of the census). </s>
<s n="s8.8;p1.23">Terms that have arisen out of ethnicity (such as ethnic minority) also have hierarchical assumptions, like 'race', but, terminology is important, and although ethnicity may have been 'abused' to create hierarchy, and ethnicity offers choice of identification not found in 'race's' static historical roots. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.23">
<s n="s1.4;p2.23">Race and ethnicity are socially constructed, and are both modern concepts<ref target="BAWE_0401c-ftnote.001"/> Ethnicity does not have a "single, universally accepted"<ref target="BAWE_0401c-ftnote.002"/> definition. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p2.23">If it were possible to define it in simple terms, Mason believes that cultural distinctiveness is a marker of ethnic grouping<ref target="BAWE_0401c-ftnote.003"/>. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p2.23">Ratcliffe, meanwhile, believes the term is deployed "loosely, to imply commonalities of language, religion, identity, national origins and/or even skin colour".<ref target="BAWE_0401c-ftnote.004"/> Ethnicity is, according to Mason, intrinsically social and is at least partly rooted in member's own self-definition, this is not apparent in 'race'.<ref target="BAWE_0401c-ftnote.005"/> According to Montagu, 'race' is "man's most dangerous myth"<ref target="BAWE_0401c-ftnote.006"/> and Miles believes the term should be abandoned, as there is no basis for developing a biological typology of the humanity.<ref target="BAWE_0401c-ftnote.007"/> As Brah states, our identity is never fixed into distinct racial barriers but is dependent on specific contextual meanings.<ref target="BAWE_0401c-ftnote.008"/> 'Race' and 'racism' serve to naturalise and fix difference. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p2.23">It is due to this controversy around 'race's' "contested character"<ref target="BAWE_0401c-ftnote.009"/> that many theorists have placed 'race' within inverted commas (as I have done). </s>

<s n="s1.3;p19.23">In addition, this confusion and ambiguity between 'race' and ethnicity continues if you observe problems within ethnicity's descriptive categories. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p19.23">As there are so many different ways to divide social reality, different labels are often incompatible and less than ideal.<ref target="BAWE_0401c-ftnote.075"/> Issues of nomenclature are important as those who create categories are often from superordinate groups and any application of labels may act to weaken the position of subordinate groups being labelled. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p19.23">The contemporary use of the term 'black' for instance, is a conscious political statement, and those defining themselves through this term are embracing a common identity.<ref target="BAWE_0401c-ftnote.076"/> However, this term subsumes all those seen as 'not white' within one category, ignoring the diversity of other ethnicities, for example Asians.<ref target="BAWE_0401c-ftnote.077"/> This focus on the particular phenotypical difference of skin colour also underlines discourses on colour, as those who talk of 'persons of colour' when referring to 'non- whites', refer to the 'Other'. <ref target="BAWE_0401c-ftnote.078"/> </s>

<s n="s3.7;p21.23">In 1991, due to the desire to catalogue and number the migrant, minority ethnic population, the census added its first question on 'ethnic group'. </s>

<s n="s2.10;p23.23">The two terms are different, with ethnicity being a more flexible concept, incorporating things 'race' did not include; culture, ancestry and language. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p23.23">However, the distinguishing points between them depend on how each of them are defined, and this has changed over time. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p23.23">Ethnicity as a primordial, essentialist term replicates many of the same hierarchical assumptions and repercussions of 'race' which can lead to forms of racism and ethnic conflict. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p23.23">However, if using a definition steeped in contextual and situational variants, some of this problem is removed, as ethnicity is not seen as static and unchanging. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p23.23">Nevertheless, attempts to define this form of ethnicity (such as Eriksen's<ref target="BAWE_0401c-ftnote.086"/>) leads to the unfortunate repercussion of freezing ethnic groups into fixed categories. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p23.23">It can also lead to nationalist agendas, which form boundaries and forms of exclusion (as seen in immigration policy). </s>
<s n="s8.10;p23.23">These conflicts are similar to new conceptualisings of 'race' which have moved away from distinctly biological determinants and towards cultural ones. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p23.23">Ethnicity (and its terms ethnic minority and 'black') also incorporate phenotypical differences, so that, in common language, the two phrases are interchangeable (the complexity of the situation demonstrated through problems in the census). </s>
<s n="s10.10;p23.23">However, academically, the two terms are recognised as different, and due to the importance of terminology, 'race' is rejected in favour of ethnicity. </s>
