<s n="s1.6;p2.12">The polymerase chain reaction is a simple procedure that only requires 3 components. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p2.12">To start with a pair of primers are needed, one for each end of the target sequence. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p2.12">A primer is a short oligonucleotide that is complimentary to a sequence of DNA that flanks the DNA sequence that needs to be amplified. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p2.12">Also needed are all four of the deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) that are the building blocks of DNA (see figure 1). </s>
<s n="s5.6;p2.12">Each dNTP contains the sugar deoxyribose, which forms the sugar backbone of the DNA molecule, a triphosphate group, and one of four bases: Adenine, Guanine, Cytosine and Thymine. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p2.12">These bases give the dNTP identity and are complimentary to each other: Adenine to Thymine and Cytosine to Guanine, which causes DNA to be double stranded (see figure 2). </s>

<s n="s1.12;p3.12">A heat-stable DNA polymerase enzyme is the last component. </s>
<s n="s2.12;p3.12">This enzyme joins dNTPs together to form a complimentary strand to the template DNA. The polymerase chain reaction consists of cycles of the same three experimental steps (see figure 3). </s>
<s n="s3.12;p3.12">At first the sample DNA is heated to 95 <hi rend="sup">o</hi>C. This melts the double stranded DNA helix into two separate strands. </s>
<s n="s4.12;p3.12">The DNA is then cooled to 54 <hi rend="sup">o</hi>C; just cool enough to allow the primers to anneal to the beginning of the flanking DNA sequences on both strands. </s>
<s n="s5.12;p3.12">The mixture is then heated to 72 <hi rend="sup">o</hi>C, which is the optimum temperature for the DNA polymerase enzyme. </s>
<s n="s6.12;p3.12">The enzyme then extends the primers using the four different dNTPs to form the complimentary sequence to the DNA, which can extend beyond the target sequence. </s>
<s n="s7.12;p3.12">The previous steps are then repeated in a new cycle, causing primers to anneal to the new single strands of DNA that were formed on the previous cycle. </s>
<s n="s8.12;p3.12">This creates new short single strands of DNA that include the primer sequences and the target region, as well as new long DNA single strands like the ones produced in the first cycle. </s>

<p n="p5.12">
<s n="s1.7;p5.12">The polymerase chain reaction is also used in the detection of HIV viral DNA. HIV is the Human Immunodeficiency Virus, which causes the destruction of the patient's immune system and can lead to the condition of AIDS. HIV has two main types: HIV-1 and HIV-2. </s>

<s n="s6.14;p9.12">This means that results can be retrieved much more quickly, speeding up the diagnosis. </s>
<s n="s7.14;p9.12">Also the polymerase chain reaction requires only a small amount of genetic material in order to work. </s>
<s n="s8.14;p9.12">In theory only one strand of the target DNA is needed in order to amplify it, as long as it is complete and undamaged. </s>
<s n="s9.14;p9.12">Therefore, diagnosis can be made at far earlier stages of HIV infection than previously achieved, which can improve survival times. </s>
<s n="s10.14;p9.12">The simplistic and automatic nature of the polymerase chain reaction also means that it takes far less time to train people up in how to use the technique; "the complete beginner can start to perform polymerase chain reaction experiments and generate meaningful results within a few days at most"<ref target="BAWE_0388a-endnote.010"/>. </s>
<s n="s11.14;p9.12">This means that the time taken and cost of training people to diagnose HIV can be significantly reduced. </s>
<s n="s12.14;p9.12">Another advantage is that the dNTP sequence of the target area of DNA does not need to be known in order to amplify that region<ref target="BAWE_0388a-endnote.011"/>. </s>
<s n="s13.14;p9.12">All that needs to be known is the sequences at either side of the gene as the positions of the primers makes sure that the DNA polymerase enzyme will automatically copy the area of interest. </s>

<s n="s1.8;p12.12">Overall it seems that the benefits of the polymerase chain reaction cannot be ignored. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p12.12">The faster and more accurate diagnosis of HIV patients is so important in ensuring that all patients are able to make the most of the time they have left. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p12.12">The polymerase chain reaction also has a use in tracking the progress of HIV patients. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p12.12">Only the polymerase chain reaction has the sensitivity to detect HIV RNA levels after antiretroviral treatment. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p12.12">Without this analysis tool the true state of HIV patients would not be known and their treatment could not be adjusted accordingly. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p12.12">Even though the specificity of the polymerase chain reaction is sensitive to its conditions, these conditions can be controlled so the optimum specificity can be achieved for every situation. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p12.12">The impressive speed, overwhelming simplicity, high sensitivity and great selectivity show that the polymerase chain reaction is too much of a useful tool in molecular medicine to dismiss over its few faults. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p12.12">It has developed so much in the past thirty years that it's impossible to predict what it will be used for in the next thirty, "The clinical usefulness of the polymerase chain reaction thus seems to be limited only by the power of our imagination in identifying specific targets."<ref target="BAWE_0388a-endnote.015"/> </s>
