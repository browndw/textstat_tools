<s n="s1.3;p23.34">The average melting point of unknown phenol A is calculated as <hi rend="underlined">98oC</hi>, which is the nearest to the one of <hi rend="underlined">m-nitrophenyl benzoate - C13H9O4N (95oC)</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p23.34">This slightly higher value, difference of 3 <hi rend="sup">o</hi>C, than literature melting point shows some impurities were likely to be present thus to increase the melting point. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p23.34">This is due to some sources of errors: </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p24.34">
<s n="s1.4;p24.34">The main source of error is probably transfers of chemicals e.g. at the beginning, 1.0g unknown phenol was first transferred from the bottle to a weighing boat to be weighed, then to the boiling tube. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p24.34">Collecting all possible crystalline product from the filter paper after filtration is always hard. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p24.34">A spatula is suggested to scrap off all product, this however increases the amount of impurities (filter paper material). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p24.34">Thus the melting point of phenol A is affected. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p25.34">
<s n="s1.1;p25.34">For measuring melting point of phenol A, triplicate glass tubes of purified solid were prepared, which increases reliability of results. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p26.34">
<s n="s1.4;p26.34">A melting point thermometer was used to measure melting point, which is heavily dependent on the experimenter's judgement. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p26.34">It could result delay in noting melting points of the three samples while reading off from the thermometer manually. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p26.34">It is possible to also use an Electrothermal - electronic melting point thermometer, thus to compare two sets of values obtained from both thermometers. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p26.34">This surely increases the validity of the results. </s>

<p rend="bulleted" n="p27.34">
<s n="s1.2;p27.34">Vigorous shaking and mixing of unknown phenol, NaOH <hi rend="sub">(aq)</hi> and C <hi rend="sub">7</hi>H <hi rend="sub">5</hi>ClO can be achieved by using an electric mixer. </s>
