<s n="s1.2;p1.20">Sue 48 years old is single and lives alone in a bed-sit. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p1.20">First diagnosed with schizophrenia when 23, she was admitted to hospital numerous times but has been maintained on antipsychotic medication in recent years. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.20">
<s n="s1.3;p2.20">Schizophrenia is a splitting of the normal links in the mind between perception, thinking, mood, behaviour and contact with reality. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p2.20">Antipsychotic medication is used to control the positive symptoms of schizophrenia; the psychotic behaviour defined as thought delusions and hallucinations generally in the form of voices but not always. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p2.20">This medication can induce negative symptoms, consequently known as secondary negative symptoms. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.20">
<s n="s1.1;p3.20">Sue has negative symptoms of schizophrenia, these can be summarised as: </s>
</p>
<list type="bulleted">
<item>A flattened affect/mood - extreme tiredness that can be interpreted as being lazy.</item>
<item>Lack of motivation and a reduced willpower</item>
<item>Reduced amount of spontaneous speech</item>
<item>Loss of self care skills</item>
<item>Reduced social awareness</item>
</list>
<p n="p4.20">
<s n="s1.1;p4.20">Symptoms such as these often persist long after the positive symptoms have ceased, and lead to social withdrawal and isolation (Creek, 2002). </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.20">
<s n="s1.3;p5.20">Currently Sue attends a day centre 3 days a week where she participates in crochet, bingo and has lunch, on the other 2 days she has lunch at the MIND club. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p5.20">She often sits in the library to read newspapers or wanders the streets. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p5.20">Socially isolated, Sue has had no contact with her family since she was 30, she has few friends and recently split up with her boyfriend Terry (who also attends the day centre). </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.20">
<s n="s1.1;p6.20">In Sues' view her medication makes her tired and fat, often she does not have the motivation to cook meals or change her clothes for bed; this shows the impact her illness has had on her functioning and self esteem. </s>
