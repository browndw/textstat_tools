<p n="p1.16">
<s n="s1.3;p1.16">
<hi rend="underlined italic">Great and Strong</hi> does not fit any classical poem's form, like sonnets. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p1.16">It has no particular rhyming schema, and no regular metric pattern. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p1.16">However, it is full of sound effects and other stylistic devices conveying unexpected foregrounding. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.16">
<s n="s1.5;p2.16">The poem is composed of three sentences of unequal length: two very short ones of two and three lines, followed by the very long last one - twenty one lines. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p2.16">However, a decent analyse should not be based on such a division. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p2.16">Even just a glance at the poem allows to perceive a typographic break in the middle of the poem (l.14). </s>
<s n="s4.5;p2.16">The lines are shorter. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p2.16">Then, reading the poem (and it is even more obvious when listening to it) confirms this feeling as the syntax changes; that is why it is interesting to analyse how each part works, starting by the first one. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.16">
<s n="s1.10;p3.16">The beginning of the poem looks like a narration. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p3.16">It is composed of short clauses built on simple structures such as subject + verb + complement. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p3.16">There are three occurrences of the structure "he was" + adjective (l.2, 6 and 7). </s>
<s n="s4.10;p3.16">This is typical of a narrative description of a character. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p3.16">The latter is referred to by the personal pronoun "he", and only once by the noun group "this man" (l.11). </s>
<s n="s6.10;p3.16">The reader is not given his name, nor anything about who he is. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p3.16">But the author chose to provide the reader with other kind of information. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p3.16">First, let us examine the post-modifying adjectives. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p3.16">The first ones l.2 repeat the title "great and strong". </s>
<s n="s10.10;p3.16">It may refer to a biblical episode: <hi rend="bold italic">Isaiah 27:1 "In that day the LORD with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan that crooked serpent." </hi>
<ref target="BAWE_3057a-ftnote.001"/> </s>

<s n="s1.1;pn1.1">
<hi rend="italic">King James Version of the Bible</hi>, on the website <seg type="URL" n="http://www.christiananswers.net/bible/"/> </s>
</p>
</note>
<p n="p4.16">
<s n="s1.1;p4.16">This intertextual reference already associates him with a killing weapon, although they are positive adjectives at first sight. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.16">
<s n="s1.3;p5.16">Another biblical allusion can be noticed l.4: "and went to wash his hands". </s>
<s n="s2.3;p5.16">In <hi rend="bold italic">Matthew 27:24 "When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye to it</hi>." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3057a-ftnote.002"/>
<s n="s3.3;p5.16">Here, the insinuation is even more impressive as it assimilates him to the religious symbol of human evil and suggests the idea of execution and blood. </s>

<note place="foot" id="BAWE_3057a-ftnote.002">
<p n="pn1.1">
<s n="s1.1;pn1.1">
<hi rend="italic">King James Version of the Bible</hi>, ibid </s>
</p>
</note>
<p n="p6.16">
<s n="s1.3;p6.16">The vision of blood is predominant through subtle devices such as intertextuality, but also more obviously thanks to the anaphora of the phrase "A little blood" (l.1, 4 and 11) which is uttered by the character. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p6.16">Although there is no inverted commas, we know that it is a direct speech thanks to the clause "he said"(l.1). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p6.16">The pre-modifying adjective "little" in an other context would tend to attenuate the morbid effect, but here it creates an uncanny irony because it is uttered by that perverse character. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.16">
<s n="s1.8;p7.16">The direct speech is a crucial feature: by giving voice to the persona, the author provides him with the great power of speech - a power that the character fully (ab)uses upon "others" (l.8). </s>
<s n="s2.8;p7.16">The importance of speech act and of words has a metatextual function. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p7.16">The author uses stylistic devices to foreground some aspects of his poem. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p7.16">For instance, the phonetic effects of sounds are strong. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p7.16">The sibilant /s/ is dominant in the first lines, especially at the end of words which makes the hissing last: "more or less" (l.1), "weakness" (l.3). </s>
<s n="s6.8;p7.16">As the poem goes on, the hissing is getting louder with the voiced sibilants /z/ ("with his elbows"), giving an feeling of suspense, as if something was going to happen and it was coming closer. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p7.16">This sensation seems to become real with the /r/ alliteration in different clusters l.9 and 10 ("air... transistors crawled through his ears"). </s>
<s n="s8.8;p7.16">Something is bound to happen, and the revelation of this "thing" may be found in the analyse of the second part. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.16">
<s n="s1.2;p8.16">The repetition of the same structure from line 14 to line 21 is very striking. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p8.16">Each line is a post-modifying clause referring to "he" (l.13), constructed on the basis: </s>
</p>
<quote lang="English">"<hi rend="bold">
<hi rend="italic">Clean as the</hi> X <hi rend="italic">of </hi>
</hi>(replaced by "<hi rend="italic">that</hi>" l.17) <hi rend="bold">Y</hi>"</quote>
<p n="p9.16">
<s n="s1.1;p9.16">except line 19, which deviates as "Clean" is substituted by "Pure", whose function (adjective) and meaning are identical, but it creates a different sound effect, as we shall see later. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.16">
<s n="s1.5;p10.16">Thus, each line is a simile that provides a new facet concerning "this man" (l.11), comparing him to various things. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p10.16">We can apply Short's parallelism rule<ref target="BAWE_3057a-ftnote.003"/> to analyse these "things" he is compared to: X is a common noun, and its meaning is often linked to the body ("anatomy", "hands", etc.); the same lexical field was already present in the first part of the poem ("hands", "elbows", fists"). </s>
<s n="s3.5;p10.16">Y is another common noun (or proper noun in l.19) whose meaning refers to death, destruction, homicide. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p10.16">The similes define him as a murderer in a less subtle and more outstanding way than the allusions found in the first part. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p10.16">This effect is achieved on one hand thanks to the irony on the association of two words of opposite meaning ("clean" versus images of blood); on the other hand, thanks to the phonetic patterns of the passage that we shall describe now. </s>
</p>
<note place="foot" id="BAWE_3057a-ftnote.003">
<p n="pn1.1">
<s n="s1.2;pn1.1">Short, M. </s>
<s n="s2.2;pn1.1">
<hi rend="italic">Exploring the language of poems, plays and prose</hi>, 1996, p.14 </s>
</p>
</note>
<p n="p11.16">
<s n="s1.4;p11.16">The /k/ alliteration in the first line of the second part (l.13) is very salient as it is on syllable-initial sounds. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p11.16">This consonance is echoed l.16 and l.19: "<hi rend="bold">C</hi>lean as the <hi rend="bold">c</hi>onscience of a <hi rend="bold">g</hi>un", "... of <hi rend="bold">G</hi>en <hi rend="bold">g</hi>his <hi rend="bold">K</hi>han". </s>
<s n="s3.4;p11.16">Its effect is reinforced since it is a velar plosive, stressed in most occurrences and also because it is the same sound that initiates the word "<hi rend="bold">C</hi>lean" which is repeated through this passage. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p11.16">These cutting sounds can be interpreted as the expression of the destructive violence of that man. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.16">
<s n="s1.2;p12.16">The nasals are also prominent in this passage; there is a lot of /m/ and /n/ in these lines, and some /ŋ/ too: "Clea <hi rend="bold">n</hi> as the a <hi rend="bold">n</hi>ato <hi rend="bold">m</hi>y of a hye <hi rend="bold">n</hi>a" (l.15). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p12.16">It is also present in the repeated "Clea <hi rend="bold">n</hi>". </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.16">
<s n="s1.3;p13.16">Line 19 introduces the bilabial plosive /p/ in a conspicuous manner - "Pure" is foregrounded as it is the only line where "Clean" is replaced by another adjective. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p13.16">It is echoed in the cluster heard in the sound pair "<hi rend="bold">sp</hi>erm"/ "<hi rend="bold">sp</hi>ore". </s>
<s n="s3.3;p13.16">This echo ironically emphasizes the semantic antagonism between the adjective (idea of purity) and the noun it refers to (sense of death and blood). </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.16">
<s n="s1.9;p14.16">Toward the end of the poem, it is worthy to note the shift from /p/ to /b/ alliteration: "<hi rend="bold">b</hi>are <hi rend="bold">b</hi>ehind", "<hi rend="bold">b</hi>ent"/ "<hi rend="bold">b</hi>owed". </s>
<s n="s2.9;p14.16">They are both bilabial plosives but /b/ is voiced whereas /p/ is unvoiced. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p14.16">Again, the effect is underpinned by the fact that the consonance is on syllable-initials and it is the first sound of the word "<hi rend="bold">b</hi>lood". </s>
<s n="s4.9;p14.16">As we said before, the vision of blood is overwhelming in the poem. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p14.16">This is proved again through the presence of an unusual lexis. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p14.16">We already noticed the morbid connotation of the words in the Y place: "gun", "slaughter-house", etc. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p14.16">More arresting is the use of the word "tampons", almost never used in poetry. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p14.16">The parallelism between l.22 and l.23 enables the reader to link "the tampons" with "all". </s>
<s n="s9.9;p14.16">The effect would have been attenuated if he had used another word; for example: </s>
</p>
<quote lang="English"> "People bent their heads, They bowed to him".</quote>
<p n="p15.16">
<s n="s1.2;p15.16">Using a personal pronoun like "they" would be neutral, with no particular connotation. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p15.16">But the association of "all" with "tampons" is very meaningful because it reveals the narrator's (and certainly the writer's) aversion towards people's blind acceptance and support for the almighty murderer. </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.16">
<s n="s1.4;p16.16">The last aspect that highlights the word "blood" is the typography of the poem. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p16.16">The penultimate line is composed of only one word "wept", verb whose subject is "a little blood" (end of the previous line). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p16.16">This particular typography represents the image of a tear (of blood) falling down, a single word for a single drop ("only a little"), that crushes and spread into three words on the line below "on the ground". </s>
<s n="s4.4;p16.16">The impact of these last lines is as moving as the whole poem, which can be compared to the persona, for both are powerful and takes the breath away. </s>
