<s n="s2.5;p1.50">A good evaluation of its implication is not possible without answering the question, "To what extent do the Hong Kong people feel that they belong to China?" </s>
<s n="s3.5;p1.50">Among the various social institutions, education is assigned the prominent role of transmitting the national identity to our next generation. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p1.50">Have the schools been doing the job successfully? </s>
<s n="s5.5;p1.50">This research aims to answer this question by looking into local secondary schools, to evaluate the changes of the schools' perceptions and practices over nationalistic education in the past 10 years, and the effectiveness of the various strategies in the implementation of nationalistic education. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.50">
<s n="s1.4;p2.50">The Hong Kong government realized the importance of nationalistic education before the handover took place. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p2.50">In 1996, the Education Department<ref target="BAWE_0350b-ftnote.002"/> published a new guideline which introduced nationalistic education into the new curriculum; in 2002, the Education Commission gave explicit prominence to the education of national identity, by putting it as one of the five priority values to be conveyed through citizenship education. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p2.50">However, the policies have not been as promising as initially envisaged. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p2.50">Students are continuously under criticism about being apathetic towards their motherland; even the local educators remain skeptical towards the notion of nationalistic education, worrying that it will lead to "blind patriotism" and undermine the critical thinking of students. </s>

<p n="p3.50">
<s n="s1.6;p3.50">The above "tension" between the policy makers and the schools illustrates the complexity in the implementation of nationalistic education. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p3.50">The construction of national identity is not a one-way process but a negotiable one between the policy makers and the schools. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p3.50">A true understanding of the process cannot be achieved without going into the school to understand its mechanism. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p3.50">In the light of this argument, the research will provide an in-depth exploration of the schools, detailing the intricate mechanisms of the teaching of nationalism. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p3.50">The research will cover both the operational level of the schools and the personal level of the teachers. </s>

<s n="s1.1;p7.50">Are there differences in understanding of nationalistic education between schools with different backgrounds, i.e. the Christian schools<ref target="BAWE_0350b-ftnote.003"/>, the Government schools and the "Pro-China"<ref target="BAWE_0350b-ftnote.004"/> schools? </s>

</p>
</note>
<p n="p8.50">
<s n="s1.3;p8.50">The research aims to study secondary schools instead of primary schools because it is believed that authority inception takes place from birth to the age of 6 to 10 (Wilson 1970). </s>
<s n="s2.3;p8.50">Students in the secondary level are more likely to question authority. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p8.50">Since the research would like to examine the "contested" nature of nationalistic education, secondary schools are preferred. </s>

<head rend="underlined bold">The Research Context</head>
<p n="p9.50">
<s n="s1.3;p9.50">"Belonging to a country" is natural and is taken for granted for most of the people in the world; but people in Hong Kong are an exception. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p9.50">Before the handover, the colonial government refrained from mobilizing any nationalistic sentiments in order to ensure stability in the territory; as a result, the education curriculum was more or less "depoliticalized" (Fairbrother 2003, Fairbrother 2005, Lam 2005, Ma 2004). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p9.50">However, after the handover, the Special Administrative Region government assigned a new mission to the schools by advocating that the promotion of national identity should be incorporated into the local civic education curriculum. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.50">
<s n="s1.7;p10.50">The apolitical youth produced by the colonial education is undesirable; but the new "political mission" assigned to the educators after the handover is no less problematic. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p10.50">The situation has been thoroughly discussed by substantial researches, both before and after 1997. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p10.50">In general, the civic education was criticized as "apolitical" both before and after the handover; the democratic value was neglected (Tse 1997) and students were continuously taught to be "economic animals" (Lam 2005). </s>
<s n="s4.7;p10.50">More importantly, the related post-colonial researches revealed the skeptical (or even repulsive) attitude of local politicians and educators towards the new "political role" of the schools. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p10.50">Arguments were raised whether "loving China" equals "loving the communist party" (Fairbrother 2005), and whether the image of China should remain homogenous and positive in the nationalistic education (Morris, Kan &amp; Morris 2000). </s>
<s n="s6.7;p10.50">A survey which was conducted after the handover showed that the majority of local secondary schools rejected the notion of "totalitarian nationalism", which demanded uncritical devotion to the state and the leadership of the ruling party (Leung &amp; Print 2002). </s>
<s n="s7.7;p10.50">The schools expressed worries about turning the nationalistic education into an irrational patriotic education.<ref target="BAWE_0350b-ftnote.005"/> </s>
</p>
<note place="foot" id="BAWE_0350b-ftnote.005">
<p n="pn1.1">
<s n="s1.2;pn1.1">Hong Kong people's repulsive attitude towards the political situation in China can be explained in a number of historical and social factors; however its discussion would be beyond the scope of the present research. </s>
<s n="s2.2;pn1.1">For reference please refer to Eric Ma on "Top-down Patriotism and Bottom-up Nationalization in Hong Kong" (2004); and Anthony Fung on "Postcolonial Hong Kong Identity: Hybridising the Local and the National"(2004). </s>
</p>
</note>
<p n="p11.50">
<s n="s1.5;p11.50">People are generally bound to their homelands either by political or cultural will (Barnard 1988, Wiborg 2000). </s>
<s n="s2.5;p11.50">If we take them as the two "approaches" in constructing the national identity among people, the above research findings have already proven that the former (political) is not feasible in Hong Kong. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p11.50">On the other hand, the construction of national identity through cultural recognition is by no means easy. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p11.50">The Chinese literature and Chinese history curriculum in the local secondary schools have been under severe attack as being rigid and irrelevant to youngsters nowadays, the number of schools that provide these two subjects is continuously dropping (Hong Kong Economic Times 2005). </s>
<s n="s5.5;p11.50">How can we cultivate the sense of belonging from the culture which students find detached and boring? </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.50">
<s n="s1.6;p12.50">My discussion seems to imply a dead-end to the path of nationalistic education. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p12.50">However my personal experience told me quite the opposite; and it gives new significance to the present research. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p12.50">When I was a reporter in the education section of Mingpao<ref target="BAWE_0350b-ftnote.006"/>, I was invited to join the schools to visit China. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p12.50">To my surprise, it was arranged for students to visit at least one manufacturing plant or giant enterprise everyday during the visit. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p12.50">The trip itself was more like a business tour which explored the investment opportunities in the mainland, rather than a tour that served an educational purpose. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p12.50">Based on the above peculiar but not uncommon observation, the present research would like to investigate on the possible "third way" in nationalistic education - the way which is not based on political or cultural attachment, but purely based on market economy. </s>
</p>
<note place="foot" id="BAWE_0350b-ftnote.006">
<p n="pn1.1">
<s n="s1.1;pn1.1">Mingpao is a Chinese newspaper in Hong Kong, which runs a daily education page. </s>
</p>
</note>
<p n="p13.50">
<s n="s1.4;p13.50">The above presumption is supported by Eric Ma. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p13.50">In his ethnographic research (2004), he argued that a "bottom-up" nationalization process has been taking place effectively on a day-to-day basis, with the increasing economic exchanges between Hong Kong and China. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p13.50">Is his argument still effective when applied to education? </s>
<s n="s4.4;p13.50">This is the new realm that the present research is going to explore. </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.50">
<s n="s1.5;p14.50">The past researches tended to base their investigations on the guidelines provided by the Education Department (Fairbrother 2003, Fairbrother 2005, Lam 2005, Morris, Kan &amp; Morris 2000), or the textbooks and curriculum available in the schools (Wilson 1970). </s>
<s n="s2.5;p14.50">These approaches kept the studies on the institutional level. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p14.50">However, school by itself should be an organic and open institution where teachers have the autonomy to influence the process and to make a difference (Apple 2002, Young 1971). </s>
<s n="s4.5;p14.50">Given that the Education Department proposed that nationalistic education would be developed as a school based programme (Leung &amp; Print 2002), teachers are the key players in the development of nationalistic education. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p14.50">It justifies a research approach which is different from most of the previous researches - instead of an institutional level of analysis, the present research will investigate schools by observing and talking to teachers, in order to capture the delicate mechanism of the implementation of nationalistic education, as perceived by the teachers, and inside the schools. </s>
