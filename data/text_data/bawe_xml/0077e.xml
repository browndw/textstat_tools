<p n="p1.39">
<s n="s1.6;p1.39">When describing the main features of the data I will choose to look at the variables included in my preferred model of exam performance to limit the extent of the analysis. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p1.39">As we can see from the distribution of marks in Quantitative Techniques it is approximately normal around its mean of 65 %.<ref target="BAWE_0077e-ftnote.001"/> The standard deviation is quite large, contributing to the relatively wide 95 % confidence interval (39.31-90.55). </s>
<s n="s3.6;p1.39">Consequently, not much confidence can be put in the point estimate of the exam results in QT. Lecture and class attendance also have high standard deviations of around 22, but a higher mean than <hi rend="italic">QTmark</hi> (means of 80.94 and 82.39, respectively). </s>
<s n="s4.6;p1.39">Attendance to revision lectures has a different distribution, where some 110 students attended none of the revision lectures. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p1.39">This partly explains the relatively high standard deviation of 40.04, together with the around eighty students that attended 100 % of the revision lectures. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p1.39">Students tend to go to either none or all of the revision lectures; consequently the dispersion of the variable is high. </s>

</note>
<p n="p2.39">
<s n="s1.7;p2.39">As we can observe from the correlation matrix shown in the appendix, there are only some of the dummies that have correlations above 0.40, which is not relatively high. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p2.39">This means that we are likely to avoid the problem of multicollinearity in the regression. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p2.39">Furthermore, out of 329 observations, around 250 of the students have an A in Maths (<hi rend="italic">MathA</hi>) from A-levels. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p2.39">The number of parents who attended university (<hi rend="italic">ParUni</hi>) are equally distributed on 0, 1 and 2 parents (with between 120 and 140 observations on each) for the 402 observations. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p2.39">For the variable <hi rend="italic">UK</hi> we have 382 observations, and around 125 students are non-UK students. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p2.39">Around 275 out of 403 students are studying an Economics degree (<hi rend="italic">Econ</hi>) in this sample. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p2.39">For reasons such as missing data the sample size differ between the variables, and this also causes the sample size of the regression analysis to be limited, because Eviews will omit observations if at least one of the variables has a missing value. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.39">
<s n="s1.6;p3.39">A part of analysing the survey is also to check if the data is viable, that is if there are some errors included in the data provided. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p3.39">For <hi rend="italic">Age</hi>, we have a maximum of 59 years, which I have not assumed to be wrong. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p3.39">However, the minimum of Age is 1 year, which can correctly be assumed to be an error. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p3.39">Furthermore, the variable <hi rend="italic">AlevelsA</hi> have a few errors too. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p3.39">First of all, there are two outliers of 17 and 87 A-grades in A-levels, which obviously can be concluded to be errors. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p3.39">I will exclude these observations from the following analysis; otherwise it will cause the regression analysis to be flawed. </s>
