<head>A. The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) </head>
<p n="p3.32">
<s n="s1.2;p3.32">Developing further the ideas of Gauss (the bell curve), Bachelier (the laws of chance) and Samuelson (options-pricing), Eugene F. Fama eventually built up a theoretical framework for pricing assets in financial markets in the 1960s and 1970s.<ref target="BAWE_0072a-ftnote.002"/> It was called the "Capital Asset Pricing Model" (CAPM) and was based on a so-called "Efficient Market Hypothesis" (EMH). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p3.32">This EMH can be divided into three forms: the weak, the semi-strong and the strong form. </s>

</note>
<p n="p4.32">
<s n="s1.2;p4.32">the weak form states that all past information is included in the current price and it is no use trying to draw conclusions from past behaviour of prices. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p4.32">Since new news arrives randomly with an average of zero (no effect on asset price) the best guess for the price of tomorrow is the price of today. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.32">
<s n="s1.2;p5.32">The semi-strong form claims that all publicly available information is immediately priced in every single stock of an index. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p5.32">Since there are many sophisticated traders in the market, new pieces of relevant information are discovered by several traders instantly and a single market player is not able to make financial gains from news. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.32">
<s n="s1.2;p6.32">According to the strong form of market efficiency, even insider information of for instance CEOs of large companies cannot be used to make a profit since there are always said to be traders who observe every single buy and sell order thus discovering the knowledge of insiders and revealing their private information which will be priced in by them at once. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p6.32">These traders are also called "arbitrageurs", which means that they spot without delay new public and private news which arrives at the market and trade to price in these announcements if relevant. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.32">
<s n="s1.4;p7.32">In order to uphold market efficiency, arbitrageurs have to dominate the market. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p7.32">In the following, I will in short present a model which shows what happens if there are not enough arbitrageurs in the market. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p7.32">The majority of the findings of the essay "Noise trader risk in financial markets" by de Long et. al. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p7.32">(1990) shape the fundamental part of the idea behind my trading strategy I will develop later on. </s>

<head>B. Questioning the EMH - the concept of "Noise Trader Risk"</head>
<p n="p8.32">
<s n="s1.4;p8.32">In 1998, Long Term Capital Management (LTCM), a huge hedge-fund, nearly went bust. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p8.32">The investment concept of LTCM consisted of recognizing market inefficiencies and betting huge amounts of money on the disappearing of these differences in market prices (compared to their historical values) in the future. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p8.32">Furthermore, 95 per cent of its capital had been liabilities and when the Russian bond market collapsed as consequence of a threatening bankruptcy of Russia, the prices of the bonds hold by LTCM differed further away from the fair historical values computed by complex computer programs. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p8.32">Without the Federal Reserve Bank of America and additional money from the involved banks, the hedge-fund would have gone bust.<ref target="BAWE_0072a-ftnote.003"/> </s>

</note>
<p n="p9.32">
<s n="s1.2;p9.32">This failure of a concept which aims at eradicating market inefficiency shows that it may be the case that sophisticated arbitrageurs do not predominate in financial markets. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p9.32">This is a crucial point since, according to Keynes (1964), "it makes a vast difference to an investment market whether or not they predominate in their influence over the game-players." <ref target="BAWE_0072a-ftnote.004"/> </s>

<s n="s1.1;p10.32">When we name the "game-players" of Keynes "noise traders" we arrive at a model of De Long, Shleifer, Summers and Waldmann (1990) which tries to quantify the effect of noise traders on asset prices. </s>

<p n="p16.32">
<s n="s1.5;p16.32">So, what are the most important lessons from the model? </s>
<s n="s2.5;p16.32">First, one can learn from the second term of the pricing function that <formula notation="" id="BAWE_0072a-form.011"/> varies more when noise traders' opinion change (<formula notation="" id="BAWE_0072a-form.012"/>). </s>
<s n="s3.5;p16.32">So the larger the ratio<formula notation="" id="BAWE_0072a-form.013"/> gets, the more volatile the asset prices <formula notation="" id="BAWE_0072a-form.014"/> will be. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p16.32">Second, the third term of the equation shows us that the average misperception of the noise traders <formula notation="" id="BAWE_0072a-form.015"/> may not be zero and consequently causes the price of equities to deviate from <formula notation="" id="BAWE_0072a-form.016"/>. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p16.32">There may occur both positive and negative departures from the fair value of 1. </s>
</p>
<p n="p17.32">
<s n="s1.3;p17.32">Third and last, we can observe from the final (negative) term of the pricing function that sophisticated traders may be driven out of the market. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p17.32">This may happen since with the share of noise traders rising they (the arbitrageurs) demand a compensation for bearing the risk that the noise traders may become even more pessimistic about the risky asset and behaving in an irrational way by selling the asset out of pure misperception of information. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p17.32">This means that prices may move further away (up or down) from the fundamental value for a long period of time. <ref target="BAWE_0072a-ftnote.005"/> </s>

<p n="p22.32">
<s n="s1.1;p22.32">It must be clear that although being able to criticize the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) it is now the task to build up a trading idea or strategy and not to develop a complete new alternative model to the CAPM since there are great difficulties to overcome.<ref target="BAWE_0072a-ftnote.009"/> </s>

<p n="p24.32">
<s n="s1.7;p24.32">First, an underlying asset has to be picked suitable for the trading strategy. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p24.32">That means that there are enough appropriate call and put options issued on this special asset and there are permanently new options offered to investors by huge banks - the availability of a special kind of option is essential for the subsequent trading strategy. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p24.32">"Appropriate" implies that there are options with an approximate omega of 10 and a proportional weekly theta, which stands for the loss of time value, of not more than 1% as used in the calculation. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p24.32">Options constructed that way can be found without difficulties.<ref target="BAWE_0072a-ftnote.010"/> So, considering these criteria I choose the Deutsche Bank AG over a period of time of four years starting end of November 2001 to November 2005. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p24.32">I considered three different trading schemes: first, I looked at the performance of the stock over one week and took the performance as a signal of buying an option with the identified properties at the end of the week. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p24.32">If the stock of Deutsche Bank AG did well over the previous week (performance <formula notation="" id="BAWE_0072a-form.017"/>0), I fictitiously bought a call option and sold it a week later on. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p24.32">On the contrary, if the stock did poor over the last week I calculated the performance of a put option for the upcoming week (the fact that the Deutsche Bank AG had been traded around its fair value of 63 $ at the beginning of the investment period is not of great importance since, as mentioned above, both the observed excess volatility and the process of mean reversion declare the fair value useless for the following calculations). <ref target="BAWE_0072a-ftnote.011"/> </s>

<p n="p28.32">
<s n="s1.1;p28.32">To put it all in a nutshell, one can see that the strategy of buying a call option after a month of positive returns of a stock and buying a put option after a month with negative returns yields 10,62 % on average on the invested money when the money from the sold option is invested in the money market and yields 2 % a year. </s>

<s n="s2.2;p29.32">Nevertheless, although the statistical measure of significance - the Sharpe ratio of the monthly trading scheme is only 0.12<ref target="BAWE_0072a-ftnote.014"/> - I think that nowadays where low interest rates prevail (the 10-year-government bond of Germany currently yields at 3,35 per cent) almost 11 per cent a year represent a lucrative investment opportunity which could be added to portfolios of rather wealthy risk takers - affluence and risk taking are necessary since one has to be prepared to lose the full amount of invested money in several periods.<ref target="BAWE_0072a-ftnote.015"/> </s>
