<s n="s1.4;p5.13">In the vineyard, the vines will be planted on the south dip slope and valley floor, where the soil is thickest which to accommodate the large roots of the vines. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p5.13">The vines will be planted north to south, allowing the maximum sun exposure. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p5.13">The vines will be planted in rows that are approximately 2m apart to allow for machinery to be manoeuvred when collecting the grapes on the valley bottom. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p5.13">On each row the vines will be planted at intervals of 4-6m, to allow development of a warm microclimate, air circulation and adequate lighting, (see figure 2). </s>

<s n="s1.3;p6.13">Seyval Blanc will be grown on the flat land. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p6.13">This grape is a hybrid and is the most disease resistant grape in the UK. It ripens late in the season and produces a wine that is light and neutral in taste and style, quite similar to Chardonnay. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p8.13">Vines have evolved to maintain a place in the sun, achieved by its entwining nature and rapid growth. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p8.13">This will be controlled by regular training and pruning. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p8.13">The most common way to train a vine is by the vertical shoot position of the trellising, (see Figure 3). </s>
