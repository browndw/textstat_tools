<p n="p28.62">
<s n="s1.4;p28.62">A review found in the Cochrane Library [1] reported that Azathioprine (1.0 to 2.5 mg/day) used among patients with non-active Crohn's disease may be effective for reducing the risk of disease recurrence over a 6 month to 2 year period. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p28.62">Higher doses of azathioprine (2.5 mg/day) are more effective than lower doses (1.0 or 2.0 mg/day) for preventing disease recurrence. </s>

<s n="s2.3;p29.62">However, the use of budesonide (3 mg and 6 mg/day) among patients with non-active Crohn's disease was not effective for reducing the risk of disease recurrence over a 12-month period. </s>
