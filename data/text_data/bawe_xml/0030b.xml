<s n="s1.4;p1.17">The study of the connections between East and West has obtained much attention from many scholars not least because it helps to explain the current world system of globalisation. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p1.17">Connections between nations can be established for several reasons, including 'for reasons of profit...the desire for power, and as a result of pure inquisitiveness'<ref target="BAWE_0030b-ftnote.001"/>. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p1.17">It is the purpose of this essay to establish why a divergence occurred between the West (more specifically Western Europe) and the East (the focus here will be China). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p1.17">I intend to investigate whether there was a rise of the West or a decline of the rest and exactly how much of this was to do with connections formed between 1300 and 1800 and how much was down to luck and good fortune. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p2.17">Before we start looking at the areas of divergence, it is useful to investigate areas of similarity. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p2.17">The economies of Europe and China in the eighteenth century were 'relatively simple, dominated by agriculture and still dependent on the seasons'<ref target="BAWE_0030b-ftnote.002"/>. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p2.17">Such reliance led to their description as "agrarian empires". </s>
<s n="s4.5;p2.17">This encompassed the stratification of peasants, including landed peasants and tenant peasants. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p2.17">There were few differences at this time: 'many western and southern European peasant farmers were hardly richer than their Asian and African equivalents'<ref target="BAWE_0030b-ftnote.003"/>. </s>

</note>
<p n="p3.17">
<s n="s1.5;p3.17">Another similarity was state control by intervention. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p3.17">The French monarchy, for example, had been 'effective at bringing in taxation revenues...[whilst areas] within a thousand miles of Ottoman Istanbul were ruled quite tightly'<ref target="BAWE_0030b-ftnote.004"/>. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p3.17">This is an achievement by the Ottomans considering the distance and topography of the land. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p3.17">A comparison with China is also possible, where 'the emperors directly managed the irrigation systems of the Yellow River and maintained the Grand Canal north of Nanjing which supplied gain to the imperial heartlands'<ref target="BAWE_0030b-ftnote.005"/>. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p3.17">Thus, it is tangible to suggest that each of the states could operate as a centralised authority. </s>

</note>
<p n="p4.17">
<s n="s1.1;p4.17">There were also similarities in religion, with Europe, China and the Ottoman state appearing to be quite secular: the Chinese were divided between Buddhism, Confucianism and Daoism; the Ottoman dynast could only head Islamic religions, yet the territory included the Jewish, Druze and Christian religions; Europe too was diverse, with denominations of Christianity such as orthodox, catholic and protestant churches all playing a role. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.17">
<s n="s1.5;p5.17">Globalisation in its earliest form has been termed "archaic globalisation" by Bayly. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p5.17">Such a process entailed the increase of social relations by monarchs exchanging 'honorific commodities'<ref target="BAWE_0030b-ftnote.006"/> between one another (universal kingship). </s>
<s n="s3.5;p5.17">Often goods in one area would be considered a luxury in another, for example Chinese porcelain in Europe. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p5.17">Pilgrimage was another example of a true global phenomenon, accentuated further by missionaries such as the Jesuits and Franciscans. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p5.17">The spread of goods and practices to promote good health also played a role.<ref target="BAWE_0030b-ftnote.007"/> </s>

<p n="p6.17">
<s n="s1.5;p6.17">A later, early modern variety of globalisation was highlighted by the 'inter-regional trades in tea, tobacco and opium...this was early capitalist expansion, beginning in the Atlantic in the seventeenth century and spreading to much of the rest of the world by 1830'<ref target="BAWE_0030b-ftnote.008"/>. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p6.17">This European push was not mirrored by others. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p6.17">Bayly extrapolates, referring to expansion as 'becoming parasitic on, perhaps cannibalising...the earlier links created by archaic globalisation'<ref target="BAWE_0030b-ftnote.009"/>. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p6.17">In addition to this, events in one part of the world were affecting other parts, where they previously had not. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p6.17">Bayly picks out the American Revolution which 'significantly altered trading patterns in Asia by forcing the English East India Company to redouble its purchases of tea in China and eventually to introduce Indian opium into Qing territory'<ref target="BAWE_0030b-ftnote.010"/>. </s>

<p n="p7.17">
<s n="s1.7;p7.17">Connections between the East and West helped create a convergence in certain areas. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p7.17">Indeed, 'Europe and parts of Asia...were in the centuries before 1800...similar both in terms of institutional structure and of economic performance'<ref target="BAWE_0030b-ftnote.011"/>. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p7.17">Van Zanden comments on the use of 'convergence', declaring that it 'implies that the starting point of those various parts of the Eurasian continent was different'<ref target="BAWE_0030b-ftnote.012"/>. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p7.17">He expounds on this by describing Asia's 'top down' institutional structure, whereby the market economy exists as a 'result of concessions given...to accommodate and even promote market exchange, with the long run aim of strengthening the (tax basis of) the state itself'<ref target="BAWE_0030b-ftnote.013"/>. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p7.17">This is a counter-intuitive idea: the ruling elites had 'to learn to abstain from using its power...in order to become more powerful'<ref target="BAWE_0030b-ftnote.014"/>. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p7.17">Conversely, the European system relied more on a 'bottom up' approach with an emphasis on the people, by way of 'guilds (of groups of merchants), chartered towns and communes'<ref target="BAWE_0030b-ftnote.015"/>. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p7.17">Such organisations were strong in early modern Europe due to its decentralised nature (seen with the emergence of economic and socio-political autonomous city-states) and worked thanks to the bond between merchants.<ref target="BAWE_0030b-ftnote.016"/> Additionally, Van Zanden describes the property system as 'fuzzy' in China, Japan and Western Europe states during the early modern period: 'the monarch claimed to be the sole owner of the land, but peasants had strong use rights'<ref target="BAWE_0030b-ftnote.017"/>. </s>

<s n="s1.1;p9.17">The passing towards modernity, symbolised by Industrial Revolution and population growth, occurred at the same time as the passage out from the 'great domestication', where, ultimately, the people farmed land intensively and not nomadically as they had in previous centuries.<ref target="BAWE_0030b-ftnote.021"/> The timeframe of this change marked a significant divergence between the East and the West. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p11.17">Before discussing the Industrial Revolution and its potential importance, it is worth defining it. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p11.17">Up until recently, the 'big bang' theory (explosion of technology and labour saving methods alongside the 'creation of a modern market economy, including a modern set of institutions'<ref target="BAWE_0030b-ftnote.023"/>) has been widely accepted: that it 'constituted a fundamental and fairly sudden break with "pre-industrial" times...[and that] it was British in origin'<ref target="BAWE_0030b-ftnote.024"/>. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p11.17">A revisionist viewpoint however was to discredit this theory and declare that the process of industrialisation can be stretched over time, 'as part of long, slow processes: market expansion, division of labour, many small innovations, and millions of people accumulating small profits'<ref target="BAWE_0030b-ftnote.025"/>. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p12.17">Economically, the Industrial Revolution was unforeseeable and there were several reasons for this set out by Van Zanden: firstly, 'the stagnation of living standards limited growth on demand, especially for relative luxurious products'<ref target="BAWE_0030b-ftnote.026"/>. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p12.17">The transformation of the economy therefore was negligible; secondly, 'declining real wages, increasing land prices and...energy prices, steered technological progress into the direction of land and energy saving innovations, whereas labour saving technologies remained under explored'<ref target="BAWE_0030b-ftnote.027"/>. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p14.17">Two things that China was lacking were overseas territory and drive for technology. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p14.17">Without having colonies, China did have 'immense overseas trade...[but] there was no mercantilism [which had] provided Europe with far more experience in the organisation of long distance trade, colonisation and warfare'<ref target="BAWE_0030b-ftnote.040"/>. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p15.17">As previously mentioned, China lacked any institution for the people, any civil society. </s>

<s n="s3.6;p15.17">China's centralist policies and lack of civil society put it at a distinct disadvantage. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p15.17">Landes sums this up well: 'even when the state did not take, it oversaw, regulated and repressed'<ref target="BAWE_0030b-ftnote.042"/>. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p15.17">Landes also placed value on the more temperate climate of Europe providing 'winters cold enough to keep down pathogens and pests...[but also the ability] to grow crops [all] year round'<ref target="BAWE_0030b-ftnote.043"/>. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p16.17">Social aspects also divided the East and West, in terms of marriage and the role of women in the state and in the household. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p16.17">In China where households were large, often comprising of several generations under one roof, the role of women was relegated below that of the man: it was nearly always a male who headed the household. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p16.17">Such restraints for women in the East obviously had a large impact on the labour market as it was rare for women to work outside of the home. </s>

<s n="s1.9;p17.17">In conclusion, divergence happened for a variety of reasons. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p17.17">The catalyst clearly was the European change of pace during and after the Industrial Revolution but differences went beyond economics and labour-saving technology. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p17.17">The presence of a civil society in Europe helped in many ways: with the people having a voice through merchant guilds and communes there was a perpetual power struggle between the elites and the masses. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p17.17">This in turn resulted in an evolving society and political climate, something that was severely lacking in Asia. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p17.17">The comparatively free political society in Europe inspired innovation and individualism which also developed society. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p17.17">The role of warfare played a part too: the Europeans had fought amongst each other and in their overseas colonies giving them greater experience of the battlefield and improving their maritime technology. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p17.17">When it came to confrontation with the East, Europe had a more experience and better technology allowing them to get the better of many Eastern countries. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p17.17">Much can also be put down to luck, for example, the coincidental discovery of coal at exactly the right time when Britain was looking for a replacement fuel for wood and the innovation to utilise the goal. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p17.17">The placement of coal fields in relatively easily accessible areas added to the benefit. </s>
