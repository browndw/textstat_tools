<s n="s1.5;p19.20">Adopting a Cultural Materialist reading of the poem challenges Stead's opinion, as structure becomes vital if we believe it serves a representative purpose. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p19.20">The surface impression of structural absence can be seen as deliberate if Eliot, like Conrad uses form to mirror society.<ref target="BAWE_3008i-ftnote.060"/> The seemingly random compendium of literary and mythical allusions, may sever the once coherent, admired words of others in order to replicate the destruction of stability and tradition engendered by war. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p19.20">Abrupt syntactic shifts appear to convey the turbulence of an era characterized by sudden change and decaying social constancy. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p19.20">Fusing varied poetic forms may be demonstrative of the difficulty inherent in establishing the European unity craved by many. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p19.20">If so, Bradbury's argument gains credibility as he believes the poem's; 'ultimate strength' to be its; ''lack of 'purism', and its capacity to maintain a pragmatic and multi-directional momentum.'<ref target="BAWE_3008i-ftnote.061"/> </s>

<s n="s1.7;p20.20">How narrative is deployed and its significance inevitably differs between the texts, as each is the product of a divergent time and society, thus making it difficult to generalize regarding narrative function. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p20.20">Both writers pioneer variants on the traditional narrative form that enable them to articulate their own unique concerns. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p20.20">The extent to which this eliminates the necessity of narrative becomes questionable, as structure is what often allows them to do so with such success. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p20.20">Narrative is not eradicated but altered; it may no longer appear in a familiar and recognizable from but it still exists. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p20.20">Mood and complex character have not become an outright substitute for narrative but have become as structurally important. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p20.20">Ironically, they do not replace interesting stories; rather they enable the writer to tell them. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p20.20">Experimentation and progress is key in both literature and the Modern period; narrative seems to have become an evolutionary technique not a redundant one, leaving me inclined to agree with Guetti that; 'as the narrative develops it is redefined so as to deny the basic assumptions upon which it appears to be constructed.'<ref target="BAWE_3008i-ftnote.062"/> </s>
