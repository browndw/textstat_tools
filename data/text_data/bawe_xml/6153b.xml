<head rend="underlined">Situation</head>
<p n="p1.98">
<s n="s1.5;p1.98">I am the owner and manager of a 180ha farm in the county of Berkshire. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p1.98">The basis of its farming activities is milk production, and at one time over 300 cows were milked. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p1.98">Latterly the number of cows has been reduced, but it remains a dairy farm. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p1.98">In addition to the dairy cows, there are also some sheep and some cereal production. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p1.98">Staff include a dairy herdsman, tractor driver and my 19 year old son, currently at university, who helps out during holidays. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.98">
<s n="s1.3;p2.98">The job of a farm manager is multi-faceted and demanding, as it requires hands on work outside alongside a vast amount of paperwork. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p2.98">However it contains many aspects that are common to all forms of management. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p2.98">The organisational goals for any manager are to maximise output, while minimising input. </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="underlined">Objective</head>
<p n="p3.98">
<s n="s1.4;p3.98">As a manager, I want to make my farm business as efficient as I possibly can in order to make a profit and create a sustainable future for myself and my staff. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p3.98">In order to do this I need to stay ahead of my competitors. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p3.98">Many larger farms employ farm managers alongside the farm owner to run the farm together, however I have the challenging job of undertaking both roles. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p3.98">Yet, at the same time I feel that this puts me in an ideal location as I am seeing the ownership and management of the farm from both perspectives. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.98">
<s n="s1.1;p4.98">Although my farm is relatively small I still think that it is important to manage the business as thoroughly as a large public company would be managed, for this way every aspect of the farm will be examined and any inefficient areas of production will be highlighted. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.98">
<s n="s1.3;p5.98">There are many different aspects to management, for a start I must look at the role that I myself play in the business, but I also must look at what affects my business, which direction I want my business to travel in, how I work towards achieving business targets and how I manage the financial assets of the business. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p5.98">These aspects are all of equal importance to me and used together they allow me to manage my business effectively. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p5.98">My objective in this report is to explain how I have adapted the main functions of management to suit my business and make the most of the resources available to me. </s>

<head rend="underlined">Managerial Roles</head>
<p n="p6.98">
<s n="s1.3;p6.98">As a farm manager I have to take on many different roles, I must plan, organise, lead, control and be responsible for the future of my farm. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p6.98">That in turn leads me to be responsible for the future of my workforce, to a certain extent. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p6.98">That puts a lot of pressure on me to make the right decisions. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.98">
<s n="s1.1;p7.98">There are three main types of skills involved in management and these go as follows:- </s>
</p>
<list type="bulleted">
<item rend="bold">Conceptual</item>
<item>Understanding the ways in which farm productivity can be maximised by researching the market at present.</item>
<item>Thinking of new ways of moving the farm business forward. To do this I must study the industry and take note of important changes that could shape my future.</item>
<item>Constructing plans of how a new idea can fit into the existing system.</item>
<item>Taking responsibility in selecting new ideas.</item>
<item>Having the knowledge of staff to apply jobs to those best suited.</item>
<item rend="bold">Human</item>
<item>Able to give a coherent explanation to the workforce which will enable them to have a better understanding of the task.</item>
<item>Possessing motivational skills that will cause the workforce to reach maximum output.</item>
<item>Meet with key players outside of the farm e.g. Bank manager, to engage support.</item>
<item>Gain key information from salesmen e.g. grain traders, machinery representatives.</item>
<item rend="bold">Technical</item>
<item>Understand the machinery used so maximum output and lifespan can be gained from it.</item>
<item>An understanding can also enable empathy with the staff carrying out operations.</item>
<item>Technical knowledge and ability is important in order to gain respect from the staff.</item>
</list>
<p n="p8.98">
<s n="s1.2;p8.98">In other industries there are many different classes of management, but in my position of farm manager I am a general manager. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p8.98">I have more than one focus as I have to manage, implement and achieve goals. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.98">
<s n="s1.2;p9.98">According to Mintzberg, 1973, a manager fulfils informational, interpersonal and decisional roles. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p9.98">These roles are all part of the tasks that a manager should complete, but often one role will help to complete more than one task. </s>
</p>
<div2>
<head rend="underlined">Informational Roles</head>
<list type="bulleted">
<item>Monitor - Activity within the farm, farming activity in the wider community and economic activity.</item>
<item>Disseminator - Receive information from my staff.</item>
<item>Spokesperson - Give information to the bank and other outside companies that I feel will benefit the business.</item>
</list>
<p n="p10.98"/>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="underlined">Interpersonal Roles</head>
<list type="bulleted">
<item>Figurehead - Invited to attend meetings, may be asked to speak or occasionally interviewed on my experiences. I am the public face of the farm.</item>
<item>Leader - Direct and motivate staff towards their work.</item>
<item>Liaison - Discuss information from similar information sources e.g. fellow farm managers, or outside information sources.</item>
</list>
<p n="p11.98"/>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="underlined">Decisional Roles</head>
<list type="bulleted">
<item>Entrepreneurial - Decide on new ways to solve existing problems and implement them.</item>
<item>Disturbance handler - Deal with machinery/staff problems, find solutions and occasionally this may lead to me having to deal with the public.</item>
<item>Resource Allocator - Decide on the most financially rewarding use of staff, machinery, livestock and capital.</item>
<item>Negotiator - Formal bargaining with the bank, dealers, traders and reps.</item>
</list>
<p n="p12.98">
<s n="s1.2;p12.98">Not all of these roles will carry equal importance for me as a farm manager, but I can guarantee that I will need to employ each of them at some point during my career as a manager. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p12.98">The roles that I feel carry the most importance to me are that of a monitor, disseminator, leader, entrepreneur, resource allocator and negotiator. </s>

<div1 type="section">
<head rend="underlined">The Manager's Environment</head>
<p n="p13.98">
<s n="s1.2;p13.98">There are three main levels of environment I, as the farm manager must study in order to achieve a successful business and these are the General environment, the Task environment and the Internal environment. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p13.98">By devoting a large amount of attention to the Internal environment I will achieve immediate success with the business, however, to provide the farm with a long term future I must also closely study the General and Task environments to see how the farm can compete and improve its position in the market. </s>
</p>
<div2>
<head rend="underlined">General Environment</head>
<p n="p14.98">
<s n="s1.1;p14.98">The General environment is also known as the PEST analysis as it studies the Political, Economic, Socio-cultural and Technological factors that affect a business and it goes as follows: - </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p15.98">
<s n="s1.3;p15.98">
<hi rend="bold">Political</hi> - Measures introduced by the Government and the EU such as the Common Agricultural Policy and Single Farm Payment. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p15.98">These must be obeyed to gain subsidies, although sometimes they can affect productivity. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p15.98">There is also much legislation concerning employee welfare and environmental protection that has to be complied with and this is both costly and time consuming. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p16.98">
<s n="s1.3;p16.98">
<hi rend="bold">Economic</hi> - Not only must I consider the location of my farm within my country but also within the world. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p16.98">A farm located within a poorer region of either the country or the world will find it harder to compete at a national/global market meaning that they will then be low on finances to purchase more resources. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p16.98">Thus they are then left further behind in the competition. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p17.98">
<s n="s1.2;p17.98">
<hi rend="bold">Socio-cultural</hi> - Public tastes in both the UK and the world are often changing. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p17.98">I must move with these changes and understand them to keep my customers and stay in business. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p18.98">
<s n="s1.2;p18.98">
<hi rend="bold">Technological</hi> - Technology is constantly being developed in the agricultural sector, pushing farming forward and improving efficiency. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p18.98">As a farm manager I cannot always afford new technology and am sometimes left behind. </s>
</p>
<p n="p19.98">
<s n="s1.5;p19.98">Within the General environment also lies the International environment. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p19.98">As a farm manager, my business not only competes with the national market, but also within the global market. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p19.98">There may be occurrences abroad that can affect the UK market. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p19.98">A perfect example of this occurred in the summer of 2006, as most of Europe and Australia was hit by drought bringing their harvest yields down. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p19.98">This resulted in a greater demand for UK produced grain, so therefore the price offered to British farmers rose. </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="underlined">Task Environment</head>
<p n="p20.98">
<s n="s1.1;p20.98">The main key players to any business lie within the Task environment as is explained below: - </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p21.98">
<s n="s1.2;p21.98">
<hi rend="bold">Customers</hi> - As the farm manager I need to monitor trends of customer preferences to see where the finished product of my business can meet their needs. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p21.98">This also allows me to distinguish where customers are not being served by their producers and to fill this area in order to prevent customers from leaving me as a producer. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p22.98">
<s n="s1.3;p22.98">
<hi rend="bold">Competitors</hi> - My fellow farmers are able to produce the same product as I and some to better value. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p22.98">If I want my farm to stay in business I have to predict the trends in farming to stay ahead of other famers so that I am able to differentiate my product. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p22.98">For my product to become preferable, it must stand out in the market, either as value added, or good value. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p23.98">
<s n="s1.3;p23.98">
<hi rend="bold">Suppliers</hi> - The supplier sets the price of good sold to farmers. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p23.98">I must find the cheapest supplier selling the best quality goods to get the most benefit from them. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p23.98">However, should stocks of certain products become low, the suppliers know that they have the monopoly over the farmer and are able to charge hideously high prices at the farmers loss. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p24.98">
<s n="s1.5;p24.98">
<hi rend="bold">Labour Market</hi> - If the labour market is full, I get greater choice over staff at lower wages. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p24.98">However, if the labour market is poor then staff chosen are of poor quality and at high expense. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p24.98">This reduces the farm profit. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p24.98">However this is less of an issue for myself as I already have two very good full time members of staff. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p24.98">Yet when my son finishes university he will no longer be able to work seasonally for me and I will have to look for another student to fill his void. </s>

<head rend="underlined">Internal Environment</head>
<p n="p25.98">
<s n="s1.1;p25.98">The Internal environment looks at work towards reaching goals and those who can aid the process, as is shown below:- </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p26.98">
<s n="s1.3;p26.98">
<hi rend="bold">Employees</hi> - The happiness of my employees has a big impact on the success of the farm. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p26.98">A happy employee will work beyond the call of duty to do something that they think will help. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p26.98">Unhappy employees can be a drag on resources, as not only will their presence be costing money, but also they may not use equipment in an efficient manner. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p27.98">
<s n="s1.2;p27.98">
<hi rend="bold">Culture</hi> - I must employ either a directional or ambiguous leadership style depending on where I feel the power balance should lie. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p27.98">I personally prefer to use a directional style, but as my staff are experienced, I like to give them a little more freedom so that they feel in control. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p28.98">
<s n="s1.4;p28.98">
<hi rend="bold">Management</hi> - As the farm manager, I must look carefully at resources, particularly staff. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p28.98">An understanding of my staff means that I can unite them to work as a team and increase success rates. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p28.98">I must know their strengths and weaknesses. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p28.98">I must also understand where other resources are best applied and have valid goals for the future of the farm. </s>

<head rend="underlined">Stakeholders</head>
<p n="p29.98">
<s n="s1.3;p29.98">The traditional view of a stakeholder is "someone who temporarily holds money or property while its owner is being determined" (Wikipedia 2006). </s>
<s n="s2.3;p29.98">Stakeholders can also be described as "interest groups." </s>
<s n="s3.3;p29.98">Within the farming business there are many stakeholders, the main ones of which are listed below: - </s>

<hi rend="bold">Customers</hi> - These are people who are affected by the outcome of the business and who can influence it, but are not directly involved with doing any of the work on a day to day basis. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p30.98">An example of a customer could be the bank should it have to loan the farm money. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p30.98">Consumers are also part of the customer group as they have the power to sway the farms future. </s>

<div1 type="section">
<head rend="underlined">Business Strategy</head>
<p n="p34.98">
<s n="s1.3;p34.98">In order for the farm business to be successful, I must analyse the business in its current state regularly to identify its strengths and weaknesses. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p34.98">This then allows me to set realistic targets for the business which will produce the most beneficial results. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p34.98">The setting of targets involves a complicated process of studying, planning and organisation and the success of this relies on good strategic management. </s>
</p>
<div2>
<head rend="underlined">SWOT Analysis</head>
<p n="p35.98">
<s n="s1.4;p35.98">An accurate SWOT analysis is crucial for setting accurate targets that are achievable. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p35.98">SWOT stands for the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats of a business and it is a valuable method of identifying the key areas of business that need to be improved. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p35.98">The strengths and weaknesses are both part of the internal environment of the business, whereas the threats and opportunities are influence by the external environment. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p35.98">I conducted a SWOT analysis of my farm business and the findings are shown below:- </s>
</p>
<p n="p36.98">
<s n="s1.7;p36.98">
<hi rend="bold">Strengths -</hi> The farm is involved in three markets as it produces dairy products, lamb and cereal crops. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p36.98">This reduces its vulnerability should the demand for one of these three products be reduced. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p36.98">Staff are kept to a minimum, reducing the financial cost of wages and seasonal labour is guaranteed in my son, who also has the added benefit of already knowing the farm and its mechanics. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p36.98">With only having two full-time men, I have good experience of how they work and where their skills lie. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p36.98">This means that I can employ them efficiently and get the best performance out of them. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p36.98">I am on the farm daily so I understand exactly how my current targets and strategies are working. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p36.98">This should help me set new targets in the future. </s>
</p>
<p n="p37.98">
<s n="s1.4;p37.98">
<hi rend="bold">Weaknesses -</hi> The farm is relatively small and although it is primarily a dairy farm the number of cows has been reduced so that it no longer specialises in the production of any one product. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p37.98">If it was specialised towards one area we would find our production costs decreasing for that area. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p37.98">Employing a small number of employees causes trouble for the farm should one of them become ill, as that leaves a lot, or possibly too much work for the others to take on. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p37.98">Looking to the future, the seasonal labour that is currently used on the farm will no longer be available once they he has finished University in two years time. </s>
</p>
<p n="p38.98">
<s n="s1.3;p38.98">
<hi rend="bold">Opportunities -</hi> Due to the farm's small size it would be easy for it to improve the quality of produce so that it can sell to a higher paying processor, such as Waitrose or Marks and Spencer. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p38.98">Alternatively the farm could diversify into organic produce, or make use of other profitable assets (Lantra, 2006). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p38.98">For example old farm buildings could be converted into offices or stables. </s>
</p>
<p n="p39.98">
<s n="s1.7;p39.98">
<hi rend="bold">Threats -</hi> Because the farm aims to supply produce to three different areas, it does not produce a tremendous volume towards one particular area. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p39.98">This leaves its position in the market as vulnerable. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p39.98">It could easily be pushed out of the market by a larger competitor. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p39.98">For example it is more economical and simplifies the business for a milk company to collect milk from just one large farm, as opposed to several small farms. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p39.98">Other threats lie within the possibility of changes to government policies towards agricultural production and national laws concerning care of employees. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p39.98">Demand for British agricultural produce could decrease, resulting in the farm receiving a lower price for its goods. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p39.98">There could also be major technological advances in agriculture culminating in the farm having to lose a tremendous amount of capital in order to keep up with competitors, or risk being pushed out of the market within a short space of time. </s>
