<p rend="bulleted" n="p3.44">
<s n="s1.1;p3.44">The hi-fi separates sector of the audio-visual market is continually expanding, whilst sought after personal advice and service is becoming harder to come by. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p4.44">
<s n="s1.2;p4.44">Michael Smith has the training and expertise to improve and properly calibrate hi-fi systems to allow them to perform to their fullest extent. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p4.44">Business experience both during top degree at <name type="university"/>, and assisting in running an existing plastics factory, provide necessary skills and foresight into running and managing a business. </s>
</p>

<s n="s1.2;p5.44">No investment is required as initial costs are low, and sufficient funds are available to Michael Smith. </s>

</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p6.44">
<s n="s1.1;p6.44">Partnership is intended for growth within the second year, with Michael Smith maintaining ultimate control over the company. </s>

<head rend="bold italic">Background</head>
<p n="p7.44">
<s n="s1.4;p7.44">A significant share of the audio-visual market has, for the last three decades, been commanded by hi-fi separates. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p7.44">Consumer research suggests that this sector of the market is still in continued growth, whilst specialised independent audio stores are on the decline. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p7.44">This leaves an increasing consumer base without personal and specialised service and advice. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p7.44">'PRIONICS' believes a niche is developing for a consultancy-based service to offer advice and knock down products to better configure the ever more expensive systems. </s>
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold italic">The Proposal</head>
<p n="p8.44">
<s n="s1.1;p8.44">'PRIONICS' proposes to offer a consultancy service for Hifi separates users, configuring systems and offering advised products to bring the most out of their cherished systems. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.44">
<s n="s1.4;p9.44">Using diagnostic tools and years of experience in the trade, the levels can be optimised, and speaker placement adjusted to maximise stereo separation and minimise reflections. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p9.44">A collection of sample products could be auditioned within the system to illustrate any benefits, the client being left with the option of purchasing these products. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p9.44">Various room treatment options will be also available a minimum cost, these could be fitted by the company at a later date. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p9.44">The team would demonstrate their benefit during consultancy. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.44">
<s n="s1.1;p10.44">Clients have the option of being added to the newsletter highlighting the latest and best deals on various accessories and second hand products. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.44">
<s n="s1.5;p11.44">There is little mention of home-call services in the Hi-fi industry at all, so if competition exists they cannot have a successful marketing strategy and 'PRIONICS' wishes to profit out of this niche. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p11.44">Once a client base is established, satisfied customers would through word of mouth spread the word bringing in a larger clientele. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p11.44">The nature of this sector of the market, high-end 'audiophile' listeners enjoy the constant refinement of their system, and 'PRIONICS' would be able to assist them in this strife. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p11.44">Good reviews would help market the service in itself as these are heavily relied upon by this small sector. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p11.44">Regular customers can then be established, some wishing to upgrade almost habitually, opening the door for part exchange and second hand dealings in the future. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.44">
<s n="s1.3;p12.44">'Specialist' Hi-fi retailers such as Sevenoaks and Richer sounds have had success beyond their mainstream electrical retail rivals within the audio-visual market. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p12.44">They touch upon the mid-range of this market, picking up from the budget that high-street retailers offers. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p12.44">This illustrates the growth of the sector, and the success has come in particular from the accessibility and the realisation of how low costs can really be. </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.44">
<s n="s1.4;p13.44">As bonds strengthen within the audio community, 'PRIONICS' will expand their services at first within the existing client base. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p13.44">Building upon the already successful trade of second hand wares by the owner, the company can introduce a part exchange and second hand range of products. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p13.44">Few retailers can now accept second hand items, including Richer sounds, especially regarding speakers. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p13.44">'PRIONICS' would be uniquely qualified to offer a true price for quality second's bettering the prices offered to Hi-fi enthusiasts at present, whilst increasing stock and the choice available to other clients. </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.44">
<s n="s1.2;p14.44">In the second year, 'PRIONICS' plans to expand and take on a partner to increase the amount of consultancy possible and expand the client base. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p14.44">Another employee shall be recruited to help manage administrative, promotional and marketing aspects of the business. </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.44">
<s n="s1.1;p15.44">'PRIONICS' hopes within 3 years to open a sister store specialising in the knockdown accessories and second hand components build up and maintained by PRIONICS' consultancy services. </s>

<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold italic">Risk</head>
<p n="p16.44">
<s n="s1.2;p16.44">Initially creating a good client base is foremost, as there is no store as such to attract attention; this venture relies heavily upon word of mouth and initial promotional work. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p16.44">The value of the service then has to be gauged and judged by the consumer, whilst the personal touch may be the edge, some clients may not be comfortable with letting strangers into their homes regarding the cost of the systems in question, and also the idea of 'PRIONICS' touching the system and offering advice on that which they take so much pride in. </s>

<s n="s3.3;p19.44">Amps occupy about 35% of the market, and a further 30% is taken by CD separates, however CD separates have the lowest value, only commanding 15% of the market in terms of total expenditure. </s>
