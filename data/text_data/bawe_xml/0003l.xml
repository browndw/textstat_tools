<s n="s1.4;p1.11">The advent of the Solidarity strikes and protests halfway 1980 struck a serious blow at the Polish communist regime. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p1.11">Whilst it provided a powerful response of workers to the repressive character and 'determination [of the Polish regime] to maintain [the political and economic] systems, whatever their human costs and lack of legitimacy',<ref target="BAWE_0003l-ftnote.001"/> an important questions comes to mind. </s>

<s n="s4.4;p1.11">Economic and political developments throughout the 1970s united with a blend of national-historical and wider Eastern European economic grievances to prepare the ferment for 'a new generation of protesting workers with a clearly different way of articulating their grievances [as] a strictly Polish phenomenon'.<ref target="BAWE_0003l-ftnote.004"/> In this essay I will have a closer look at the development of a class spirit among Polish workers, and argue that it was from their socio-economic situation that discord arose. </s>

<p n="p2.11">
<s n="s1.3;p2.11">The prehistory of the Solidarity movement was, most importantly, sparked by an increasing crystallisation of a "class consciousness" within the ranks of the Polish work force, many of whom were becoming convinced 'that they [could only] improve their lot collectively'.<ref target="BAWE_0003l-ftnote.005"/> Despite official state rhetoric, there was an increasingly realistic attitude to the existence of a new dominant class made up of 'the intelligentsia as a whole rather than just the bureaucracy narrowly defined';<ref target="BAWE_0003l-ftnote.006"/> a class of highly educated, better-rewarded technocrats and managers, charged with the daily affairs of increasing efficiency of production and economic policy making. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p2.11">While official policy claimed to pursue a policy of egalitarianism, the reality behind these claims was only limited. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p2.11">The producing classes, those of the workers and peasants, found themselves on the same position in the material hierarchy as before, while a decrease in real standards of living were initially concealed only by the relative success of social mobility.<ref target="BAWE_0003l-ftnote.007"/> However, the stretch of social mobility had its limits and by the 1970s a new generation of workers, unfamiliar with opportunities for social mobility, many of them younger than 25 years of age, began to form an increasingly articulate and assertive sense of collective grievances.<ref target="BAWE_0003l-ftnote.008"/> While according to the orthodox theory of communism the party was the vanguard of the workers, epitomising its real interest, workers on the work floor reportedly referred to 'management in the third person, reserving "we" for themselves'.<ref target="BAWE_0003l-ftnote.009"/> This clearly meant the beginning of an independently developing working class, at odds with the intelligentsia and a regime increasingly alienated from Poland's new social reality. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p3.11">Similar to the England of the early nineteenth century, the creation of a new Eastern European working class indeed took place within the rather short timeframe of one or two generations. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p3.11">Over the decades after the Second World War, an average of nearly fifty percent of the younger peasantry came 'to form the new working class, [and] to create the social drama of a new life, a new world'.<ref target="BAWE_0003l-ftnote.010"/> As their direct socio-economic interests began to reveal themselves in increasing antagonism with the state-directed economic policy, Polish workers, as a class <hi rend="italic">an sich</hi> and with an agenda different even from that of the oppositional intelligentsia, more and more often became involved in violent confrontations with the state.<ref target="BAWE_0003l-ftnote.011"/> Social discord became increasingly apparent, and ''Poles murdered by Poles, workers murdered by a 'Workers' State', became the symbol for all their accumulated grievances'.<ref target="BAWE_0003l-ftnote.012"/> </s>

<s n="s1.5;p4.11">Timothy Garton Ash's assertion that 'December 1970 [was] the single most important date in the pre-history of Solidarity',<ref target="BAWE_0003l-ftnote.013"/> may provide further insight into the extent that Solidarity was connected to the working class. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p4.11">Its reaction to the government's implementation of food price increases revealed signs of a growing unity and singular purpose of action. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p4.11">When the government resolved to give up its policy of consistent non-unemployment 'aimed at forcing greater productivity through the use of threat of unemployment as an incentive for better and more efficient work',<ref target="BAWE_0003l-ftnote.014"/> this seemed a direct threat to workers at large. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p4.11">After strikes and violent confrontations throughout January 1971, the government withdrew its economic reform plans, while Gomułka was forced to step down as a consequence of his unpopular repressive measures and number of deaths as a direct consequence thereof.<ref target="BAWE_0003l-ftnote.015"/> This political outcome was seen by many protesters as a direct result of their protests, which served made workers realise where there strength lay.<ref target="BAWE_0003l-ftnote.016"/> Throughout the 1970s, many strikes followed, and although the regime 'exacted its revenge on the workers', resulting in many workers being 'sacked, arrested, beaten, jailed',<ref target="BAWE_0003l-ftnote.017"/> strikers usually got what they wanted. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p4.11">This, and the fact that many protests 'involved a large group which was generally representative of the worker population as a whole',<ref target="BAWE_0003l-ftnote.018"/> accounts for the growth of an awareness that the economic situation of workers was connected with, and could be influenced by, their political role as an occupational group. </s>

<s n="s3.8;p5.11">The Polish communist party had, from the onset, based much of its legitimacy through the reasonably successful initiation of a process of social mobility upward. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p5.11">Workers were recruited from among the peasant ranks, while better-educated workers were needed to support the growing bureaucratic apparatus.<ref target="BAWE_0003l-ftnote.019"/> These developments enabled many to enter new realities that were hitherto undreamed of, creating a sense of greater equality, if not of material wealth, then of opportunity. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p5.11">It also sparked, however, another process, which would later develop into one of the primary reasons for the antagonism between the workers and the intelligentsia as a whole. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p5.11">The quick development of industries created a culture of technocracy, in which economic status became more directly related to 'a hierarchy of statuses based on diplomas, irrespective of the actual amount of work done'. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p5.11">This put pressures on access to higher education as a direct way of material advancement,<ref target="BAWE_0003l-ftnote.020"/> as the intelligentsia were protective of their traditionally advantaged position. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p5.11">The attitude of this "red bourgeoisie" was becoming an assertion '[t]hat they do and <hi rend="italic">should</hi> live better than workers'.<ref target="BAWE_0003l-ftnote.021"/> This, however, created tension, as these 'unequal patterns of allocation of social rewards' were legitimised by the class that benefited from it, 'despite the traditional systemic commitment to egalitarianism'.<ref target="BAWE_0003l-ftnote.022"/> With the decreasing flexibility in the Polish labour market, most economists and sociologists began to note a shift from 'phases of system-building to the tasks of system-maintenance'.<ref target="BAWE_0003l-ftnote.023"/> The loss of revolutionary economic appeal for the masses, however, eventually began to cost the Party members as well; 'between October 1980 and March 1981 the Party lost 216,000 members, bringing total membership below three million'.<ref target="BAWE_0003l-ftnote.024"/> </s>

<s n="s1.5;p6.11">The stagnation of social mobility can be said to have a two-sided effect. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p6.11">While, one the one hand, it formed a ferment for discontent because the state failed to meet the workers' expectations of equality, Eastern European 'regimes [had to], in a sense, deal with the workers they have'.<ref target="BAWE_0003l-ftnote.025"/> While the legitimating narrative came out of redistribution, 'the technocrats, like the ruling elite itself, [had] an interest in keeping labor in a dispositive position',<ref target="BAWE_0003l-ftnote.026"/> which entailed maintenance of the status quo. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p6.11">A further source of frustration was found in the fact that, despite repeated pledges for reform from the party leadership, very little change was noticed, while concessions were repeatedly watered down.<ref target="BAWE_0003l-ftnote.027"/> This was particularly hard to swallow since continually facts were coming to light revealing the decadent and privileged world that the small number of the party and administrative élite'<ref target="BAWE_0003l-ftnote.028"/> had created for themselves. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p6.11">Contradictions were experienced very starkly when any kind of protest was followed by measures on a worker's economic privileges and 'any sign of active solidarity' was immediately called 'political conspiracy'.<ref target="BAWE_0003l-ftnote.029"/> Gradually, workers began to connect their economic discontent with a wider, social picture, which thoroughly undermined the legitimacy of the state. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p6.11">As now the argument of economic prosperity was no longer something Gierek could count on, the social and political situation became something of a ticking bomb. <ref target="BAWE_0003l-ftnote.030"/> </s>

<s n="s3.3;p9.11">Surely, there existed a strong section of "critical intelligentsia", yet their position was precarious: whereas they assumed a role as the voice of the working class, they were also 'part of the intellectual class, from which neither its structural position nor its value-system [allowed] it to secede'.<ref target="BAWE_0003l-ftnote.037"/> It is said, moreover, that moral decay could be observed across the intelligentsia - so much so, that one sociologist spoke of 'the 'semi-feudalisation' of Polish society'.<ref target="BAWE_0003l-ftnote.038"/> The success propaganda of communist society that western historians are quite familiar with, also seemed to have blinded the regime, rendering it numb to criticism or alternative ideas.<ref target="BAWE_0003l-ftnote.039"/> This hostile view, however, is only useful to a certain extent, and it is more likely that many members of the intelligentsia simply still '[had] a stake in the status quo and, therefore, support[ed] it'.<ref target="BAWE_0003l-ftnote.040"/> </s>

<s n="s1.1;p10.11">There were, however, also initiatives from the intelligentsia within broad daylight of the Party's political sphere, which provided powerful criticism of the way in which the state treated dissident workers.<ref target="BAWE_0003l-ftnote.041"/> And while many intellectuals desiring reform continued to trap themselves in 'an iron cage' of 'the limits of possible reform',<ref target="BAWE_0003l-ftnote.042"/> organisations such as the Committee in Defence of the Workers (KOR) set out in a number of semi-legal ways to create a bond of solidarity between workers and intellectuals, an number of them eventually becoming involved in Solidarity.<ref target="BAWE_0003l-ftnote.043"/> Examples of selfless and risk-taking initiatives are not hard to find; intellectuals such as Miroslaw Chojecki lost their jobs, continuously spent time in jail and got beaten up, in the meanwhile enabling the publication of 150 illegal books.<ref target="BAWE_0003l-ftnote.044"/> The problem of intellectualism and political involvement, however, would eventually cause problems by 1989, when, during the round table talks intellectualism gave the negotiations an air of secrecy and 'institutional horse trading'. <ref target="BAWE_0003l-ftnote.045"/> </s>
