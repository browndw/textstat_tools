<s n="s1.2;p2.119">Discussions of modality are generally included in discussions on tense and aspect (e.g., Berk, 1999; Downing &amp; Locke, 2002; Greenbaum &amp; Quirk, 1990; Huddlestone, 1988; Palmer, 1990) so it will be useful here to look briefly at the connections. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p3.119">The interconnection of the three categories is evidenced when it is recognised that every time we construct a clause we are obliged to use a tense and an aspect which we then may choose to modalise or not (Downing &amp; Locke 2002). </s>
