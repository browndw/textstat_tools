<head>Introduction</head>
<p n="p4.24">
<s n="s1.1;p4.24">The aim of this laboratory was to write a program for the M16C microcontroller to rotate one segment of the LED1 clockwise then output all of the segments simultaneously then displays only the decimal point and repeats. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.24">
<s n="s1.2;p5.24">Code was written using the IAR Embedded Workbench software. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p5.24">A look-up table for the LEDs in terms of bytes was required as well as defining the input/output ports and code to switch the correct LED on. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.24">
<s n="s1.1;p6.24">The objective of the report was to enhance knowledge of extended C programming code, specifically in this case the code required to control the M16C microcontroller. </s>

<head>Time multiplexing</head>
<p n="p7.24">
<s n="s1.2;p7.24">The two LED segment displays are both run from the same eight output pins of the microprocessor. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p7.24">If both LED segments are set to display information from these ports at the same time, they will display the same data. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.24">
<s n="s1.4;p8.24">The eight output pins change state at a very fast rate. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p8.24">Alongside these eight pins are two more output pins. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p8.24">These select which LED segment display information. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p8.24">At one moment in time, one LED segment shall be displaying information from the eight output pins; milliseconds after this, the other segment shall display information (which has now changed) from the same pins. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.24">
<s n="s1.3;p9.24">To the user this has the effect of both LED segments being controlled separately at the same time from only eight output pins and two LED selector pins. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p9.24">This is due to the fact that the human eye cannot respond to the difference in the displays fast enough. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p9.24">If a slow motion camera was to capture information displayed on the two different segments they would seem to flash on and off one after the other. </s>

<s n="s3.3;p10.24">For example, to display zero, ports corresponding to segments A, B, C, D, E and F would all have to be low, whilst G and DP would need to be high <hi rend="bold">(any values referred to as "high" or "1" are above 5V DC, "low" or "0" values are 0V DC).</hi> </s>
