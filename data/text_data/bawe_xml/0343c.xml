<s n="s2.3;p2.31">The size-related resource limitations and quick-response requirements in delivery service SMEs (Small and Medium Enterprises) make them more alert to the value-for-money, reliability, maintainability, effectiveness and productivity ICT solutions (Information and communication technologies) (Chaffey 2004, p18). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p2.31">Establishing a real-time enterprise could be a vital approach for the current delivery business to cooperate the Internet-enabled and other e-commerce mechanisms into an integrated management of within-firm (the internal operation activates) and cross-firm businesses (the sell-side and buy-side activities). </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.31">
<s n="s1.5;p3.31">To be a competitive real-time enterprise and to sustain the competitiveness, a "real-time" information system means that business transitions are executed by straight through processing (STP) - an internal online passthrough process. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p3.31">In the internal STP, a front-desk and back-office connection is carried by intranet, and the external STP interconnects business partners which could be inbound if the company get input from selling to customers and could be outbound if the company buys an input from company's counterparties. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p3.31">Therefore, the links between value chains can be tightened instantly with automatic connections to other counterparties' network, such as the fuel suppliers. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p3.31">Rapid performance can help the company to get competitive advantage in the supply chain (such as shorten the delivery lead time and quicken the cash flow in buy-side of business), expand marketplace (such as widen the interaction with customers in the sell-side of business), and especially upgrade the level of confidence for a further improvement in the organisation (such as reduce the work load and increase the profit-margins in internal side of business). </s>

<s n="s2.2;p6.31">E-marketing techniques can build up or improve brand awareness in a cost-effective way -- if a customer has a good experience in terms of site performance or fulfillment, then the company will possibly get the brand loyalty effortlessly (Chaffey 2004, p318). </s>

<s n="s1.6;p7.31">Foremost, a user-friendly website interface with sound self-service tools will be a vital transaction in the e-marketing. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p7.31">As a delivery company's website, a straightforward searching tool for navigation with clear display page will contribute to classification. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p7.31">A consistent view template of electronic catalogue for standard service is appropriate for smaller business and customers with smaller quantity. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p7.31">Technical categorisation tools for site content layout requires the HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CAD/CAM systems (Computer Aided Design/ Computer-aided manufacturing), 3D technology (such as Map Assistance) and engineering drawings (such as using Photoshop and Flash in advertisements). </s>
<s n="s5.6;p7.31">Those technologies can be used to visualise the service specification and availability information on the on-line catalogues, and to style attractive advertisements for customer. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p7.31">(Chaffey et al 2004, pp248-53) </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.31">
<s n="s1.4;p8.31">Secondly, a transactional e-commerce website interface is not only just concentrating on the category display, but also on effectively matching the varied consumer requirements. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p8.31">A clear Searching tool on browser and a speedy Calculator are indispensable to show the possible delivery period, achievable destinations, accredited dispatching time, relatively price and discount. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p8.31">A different price responding to the customer's each selection using an on-line Auctions technique -- according to different area or different period of arriving time, like purchasing a rail tickets, will help to promote the individual customers to make their decision. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p8.31">Additionally, the company might set up different language sections for different target users in the UK and a set of the FAQ (frequently asked questions) and index to assist site visitors. </s>

<s n="s3.5;p9.31">Protx is the largest independent third party payment gateway with quite lower monthly fee in the UK. It provides transaction confirmation e-mails to company and customers, and settles down the payment automatically in three days. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p9.31">FactMerchant's payment system is another integrated, secured and flexible assistance, where customer can settle in different currencies (it could be a competitive advantage to attract foreign customers in UK and prepare for global marketplace) and demand historical spending account details on secured pages (Cunningham 1999, P83). </s>

<s n="s4.8;p10.31">Those media agencies tend to offer all the skills in content development, advertisement design and online promotion. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p10.31">This online adverting -- banner advertising is a small banner with keywords graphically pops up on a web page, which is normally charged by spot lease, click-through or ad impressions rate (cost per mille (CPM)). </s>

<s n="s7.8;p10.31">Co-branding is a free way for promotions by affiliating banner advertisement, such as banner exchanges and allied sites (Chaffey 2000, p249-51). </s>
<s n="s8.8;p10.31">Banner is a valuable method for Send-Me Services in the e-marketing process, but problems will be from people's disregard. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p11.31">Special promotions can be sent to customer directly by opt-in e-mail or instant message on a monthly or periodic basis without sending extra booklet to customers (Wilson, 2000). </s>

<s n="s1.3;p20.31">E-procurement, under an enhanced budgetary control, can improve the efficiency and accuracy without the involvement by the purchaser which may pose a non-strategic sourcing and purchases along with duplicating redundant and disconnected ordering of information (because the purchase-order has to be specified separately by Send-Me Services and again on the order for the suppliers through a disposal cycle of transport, delay, process, transport, delay). </s>
