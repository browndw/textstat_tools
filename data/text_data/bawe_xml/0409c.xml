<p n="p6.42">
<s n="s1.1;p6.42">What is the role of law in regulating the power relations in everyday life and what are the impacts of everyday experiences on law? </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.42">
<s n="s1.4;p7.42">The study of social movements draws from the critical approach to liberal theories of international law, human rights and justice. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p7.42">The study of social movements enables to challenge the dominant legal framework because their resistance is based on a re-appropriation of the authorship of the definition of legality: they act at the border between legality, illegality and non-legality. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p7.42">They link 'everyday forms of power, struggle and institutional politics, including at the national and global levels'<ref target="BAWE_0409c-ftnote.002"/>. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p7.42">Law is being reshaped in the way social movements use law at every level, depending on what they want to achieve: the local laws are challenged by the use of regional agreements and supranational institutions, international scrutiny and solidarity is called on the local struggles through the use of international legal instruments and NGOs. </s>

</p>
<p n="p9.42">
<s n="s1.1;p9.42">Rajagopal argues that the various social movements in the Third World challenge international law in two ways. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.42">
<s n="s1.8;p10.42">First, they have their own conceptions of modernity and development that conflict with those of international law. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p10.42">It is a new way of thinking law: how to write resistance into international law? </s>
<s n="s3.8;p10.42">They use the language of human rights as the legal tool and 'discourse' of resistance. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p10.42">It is at the same time part of the dominant legal discourse, but also the strongest asset social movements have in order to achieve their resistance. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p10.42">They propose alternative human rights, different from the ones on which the state focuses, but without conflicting with the state. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p10.42">While the mainstream approach is characterized by a dualist position: either statist or anti-statist, social movements go beyond this duality. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p10.42">Social movements move international law from its institutionalist and formalist realm and propose new definitions of democracy. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p10.42">The neoliberal property rights regime is being rejected by the re-appropriation of resources by the local and by a redefinition of the concept of property which instead of being exclusive becomes inclusive and shared. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.42">
<s n="s1.1;p11.42">Second, the global international system is not appropriate and is being transformed at the local level. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.42">
<s n="s1.5;p12.42">A social movement perspective brings theoretical challenges to international law. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p12.42">Social movements are identity-based. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p12.42">There is not one definition of social movements since they encompass a plural reality, various actors with various motives and methods of resistance based on different 'political cultures'. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p12.42">This inherent plurality is precisely the challenge to the reductive, universalist and rationalist character of international law<ref target="BAWE_0409c-ftnote.003"/>. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p12.42">For example, the feminists have shown that the distinction between private and public in the liberal theory was not relevant. </s>
