<head>Abstract</head>
<p>The literature on monetary economics has devoted a long effort to explaining why economies may end up with positive inflation rates without any positive effect on output. After the seminal contributions of Kydland and Prescott (1977) and Barro and Gordon (1983a) the explanation has been focused on the time consistency problem (TCP) that the policymaker suffers when conducting monetary policy: the optimal inflation rate from his viewpoint is different before and after the public sets the expected inflation, even though no relevant change in the set of information occurs. The paper explains that delegating monetary policy to an independent Central Bank helps to reduce the TCP. Furthermore, the principal contribution of the essay is to show that the mechanism operates by increasing the marginal cost that the policymaker faces for generating inflation when compared to the pure discretionary case. However, addressed here is that the TCP is not fully solved unless the policymaker's aversion to inflation tends to infinite, which is not optimal since this generates a high stabilisation bias. Some empirical evidence is revised which suggests that when CBs are more independent the average inflation rate is reduced, the UK case after May 1997 being particularly analysed.</p>

<head>Introduction</head>
<p n="p1.142">
<s n="s1.1;p1.142">A considerable effort has been made in economics in the last thirty years with the aim of answering important issues regarding monetary policy: why an economy ends up with positive inflation rates without any remarkable positive effect on output, and why it seems difficult to achieve a final outcome with zero inflation and, at least, the same output level. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.142">
<s n="s1.2;p2.142">To answer these questions the seminal papers by Kydland and Prescott (1977) and Barro and Gordon (1983a) (henceforth KP and BG, respectively) first developed an analytical framework based on the so-called time consistency problem (TCP). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p2.142">The policymaker faces a trade-off between unexpected inflation and output but, as the public incorporates that, the expected inflation is set at a sufficiently high level so that the government's best response is to validate this inflation and the output is not affected. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.142">
<s n="s1.4;p3.142">Many suggestions have been assessed about how to improve this suboptimal equilibrium. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p3.142">For instance, KP and BG highlight that by imposing strict rules on the policymaker the TCP might be eliminated. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p3.142">Rogoff (1985), on the other hand, points out that by delegating monetary policy to a conservative central banker the TCP is reduced. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p3.142">Furthermore, this framework gives analytical support to the explanation about why modern Central Banks (CB) tends to be more independent <hi rend="sup">1</hi>. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.142">
<s n="s1.1;p4.142">The paper has two main objectives: firstly, address critically the TCP in monetary policy; secondly, answer why by delegating monetary policy to an independent CB it is possible to reduce the TCP. Some evidence is also introduced to overview to what extent independent CBs have reduced the TCP from an empirical perspective with emphasis on the UK experience after 1997. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.142">
<s n="s1.3;p5.142">One of the main conclusions of the paper is that the TCP seems to arise only under institutional setups where the policymaker faces some degree of discretion. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p5.142">In this case, the policymaker faces a marginal benefit of generating inflation which exceeds the marginal cost when the inflation rate is announced below the equilibrium level, which may induce him to not validate such announcement. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p5.142">Furthermore, developing this particular insight to the problem I show that delegating monetary policy to an independent CB helps to reduce the TCP since, for a given marginal benefit, the marginal cost of generating inflation rises compared with the pure discretionary case. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.142">
<s n="s1.4;p6.142">The remaining of the paper is organized as follows. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p6.142">Section I critically addresses the TCP in monetary policy. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p6.142">Section II assesses how an independent CB helps to reduce the TCP. Section III analyses some empirical evidence emphasising the UK case after 1997. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p6.142">Section IV presents concluding remarks. </s>

<head>I. The time consistency problem in Monetary Policy</head>
<p n="p7.142">
<s n="s1.2;p7.142">The TCP <hi rend="sup">2</hi> in monetary policy arises when certain decisions (forming part of an optimal plan) at an initial date are no longer optimal at a later date, even though the information set between periods has not changed (Blanchard and Fisher 1989, p. 592). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p7.142">Kydland and Prescott (1977) (KP) first explained the TCP the monetary authority may suffer when conducting monetary policy. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.142">
<s n="s1.2;p8.142">In particular, KP points out this problem considering a situation where the policymaker optimises a social objective function in each period, in a world where agents do not have mechanical <hi rend="italic">ad hoc</hi> expectations upon past prices (op cit., p. 478). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p8.142">A further refinement of this original idea was introduced by Barro and Gordon (1983a) (BG) in an attempt to include a theory of expectations formation (op cit., p. 592). </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.142">
<s n="s1.1;p9.142">In the remainder of the section, a detailed and formal explanation of the TCP in monetary policy mainly based on the BG contribution will be critically addressed. </s>

<head>A. Formal explanation</head>
<p n="p10.142">
<s n="s1.1;p10.142">The notation used for the explanation is borrowed from Walsh (2003) which, in turn, slightly modifies the BG notation. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.142">
<s n="s1.4;p11.142">As suggested previously, the TCP involves the incentives the policymaker faces when deciding economic policies, the way in which the public forms expectations and their respective interactions within a particular institutional arrangement. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p11.142">Worthwhile emphasising is the importance of the institutional framework in which the monetary authority determines economic policies (e.g., growth rate of money supply). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p11.142">As will be clear later in this section, the existence of the TCP implicitly requires that the policymaker have a certain degree of discretion when conducting monetary policy. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p11.142">Or, put another way, an institutional arrangement which does not commit the policymaker to strictly follow particular monetary policy rules. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.142">
<s n="s1.1;p12.142">For the sake of clarity a detailed analysis of the objectives and constraints that each of these actors faces when optimising will be assessed in detail. </s>

<p n="p13.142">

<p n="p16.142">
<s n="s1.2;p16.142">Such a specification differs from BG in considering the output rate rather than the unemployment rate. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p16.142">Without any loss of generality, I decided to introduce the Walsh (2003) approach considering that the CB probably cares about economic activity in general, rather than only the unemployment rate. </s>
</p>
<p n="p17.142">
<s n="s1.2;p17.142">The fact that output and inflation are introduced in (1) in a quadratic form assumes that the CB will care about the variance of both variables. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p17.142">I suggest that the importance of considering the variance of output and inflation affecting society's expected loss arises since not only the level but also the volatility of the main macroeconomic variables may affect economic performance <hi rend="sup">6</hi>. </s>

<p n="p18.142">
<s n="s1.3;p18.142">A particular issue is related to the existence of the parameter <hi rend="italic">k</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p18.142">It is commonly assumed that <hi rend="italic">k</hi> reflects distortions in the economy, such as unemployment compensations (BG 1983a, p. 593), monopolistic competition in the goods market or political pressures (Walsh 2003, p. 367). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p18.142">In fact, the existence of such distortions gives the CB an incentive to utilise monetary policy with the desire of obtaining an output rate above the natural rate <hi rend="sup">7</hi>. </s>
</p>
<p n="p19.142">
<s n="s1.4;p19.142">On the other hand, an interesting question arises around the explanation of the costs of inflation. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p19.142">For instance, BG (1983b, p. 104) argued that society's costs of inflation are not well explained by economists but seem to be associated with costs inherent to changing prices (i.e., menu costs). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p19.142">A few years after this assertion and, perhaps, after a few high inflation processes, Alesina and Summers (1993, p. 152) claimed that the costs of inflation are associated with the rise in economic distortions, rent seeking activities and interest rates. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p19.142">Hereafter, I will identify the costs of inflation with the broad interpretation given by Alesina and Summers. </s>

<s n="s3.3;p26.142">For this reason, I will assume that the CB manages the growth rate of money supply <hi rend="italic">∆m</hi> which, in turn, has a one-to-one effect on inflation as reflected in (4)<hi rend="sup">8</hi>. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p107.142">On May 6, 1997 the UK Government gave operational independence to the Bank of England (BE) (i.e., instrument independence to determine monetary policy) as part of a new monetary arrangement introduced in the UK <hi rend="sup">23</hi>. </s>

<head>IV. Summary and Conclusions</head>
<p n="p111.142">
<s n="s1.1;p111.142">This paper critically addressed the TCP that a policymaker may suffer when conducting monetary policy, defined as a situation where his optimal decision is not the same before and after the public set the expected inflation, even though the information set between periods remains equal. </s>
</p>
<p n="p112.142">
<s n="s1.4;p112.142">I explained that behind the TCP remains the assumption that an institutional setup exists which allows the policymaker to behave with discretion. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p112.142">In other words, the policymaker is able to optimise his objective function in each period. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p112.142">Since he faces a trade-off between unexpected inflation and output and the public knows such incentive, the latter sets the expected inflation at a level at which the marginal benefit equals the marginal cost that the government faces for generating inflation. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p112.142">Thus, the economy ends up in a suboptimal equilibrium with positive average inflation without any effect on output beyond the natural rate. </s>
</p>
<p n="p113.142">
<s n="s1.3;p113.142">How this suboptimal outcome could be improved was extensively addressed. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p113.142">First, the expected social loss under discretion was compared with that given by the 'optimal rule': a fully credible institutional framework which commits the government not to depart from the announced inflation rate while still allows it to manage monetary policy to reduce the effects of supply shocks. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p113.142">However, it was pointed out that such a framework could not be very useful in practice since it is difficult to anticipate the contingencies that an economy may suffer. </s>
</p>
<p n="p114.142">
<s n="s1.3;p114.142">Nowadays, delegating monetary policy to an independent CB tends to be one of the most popular ways in which modern States try to overcome the TCP, analytically based on the Rogoff (1985) contribution. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p114.142">With a particular insight to the problem I argued that in this case the TCP is reduced since the policymaker faces a higher marginal cost of generating unexpected inflation when comparing with the pure discretionary situation. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p114.142">Furthermore, I explained that the TCP is not fully solved unless the inflation aversion of the central banker tends to infinite, an undesirable fact since it increases the stabilisation bias. </s>
</p>
<p n="p115.142">
<s n="s1.4;p115.142">A brief insight to the empirical evidence was made, showing a negative correlation between the degree of CB independence and either the average or variance inflation, without negative effects on economic activity. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p115.142">An overview on the effects of the change in UK monetary arrangement after May 1997 is also in line with these results. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p115.142">However, I sustained that this evidence should be taken as indicative, since other factors not directly related to CB independence may affect the final outcome. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p115.142">Put another way, empirical evidence suggests that the TCP tends to be partially reduced with more independent CBs but the difficulties in measuring CB independence and the existence of other factors which affect the likelihood of inflation suggest that that this evidence is only indicative. </s>
</p>
<p n="p116.142">
<s n="s1.3;p116.142">An interesting extension of the paper will be postponed for further research. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p116.142">It seems worthwhile asking if other institutional arrangements may help to reduce the TCP present under discretion without generating the stabilisation bias. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p116.142">A possible starting point to this insight, following the approach stated in Svensson (1997), seems to be explaining formally how an inflation targeting regime helps to overcome the TCP and to contrast the results with those obtained in this paper. </s>
</p>
<p n="p117.142">
<s n="s1.1;p117.142">
<hi rend="sup">1</hi> The TCP may also be reduced, for instance, when the reputation of the CB is considered, particular contracts are introduced in which the CB's compensation depends on inflation objectives or by limiting the CB's flexibility by institutional arrangements such as inflation rules (see Walsh 2003, p. 378 for a complete discussion). </s>

<s n="s1.2;p123.142">
<hi rend="sup">7</hi> It is interesting to note that, as Svensson (1997, p. 109) among others claimed, the golden rule in economics should be to eliminate the distortion directly attacking the causes of the problem. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p123.142">For this reason, the mere fact of utilising monetary policy to solve such distortions explains why, at most, a second-best outcome would be obtained (See Svensson op cit. for a further discussion). </s>
</p>
<p n="p124.142">
<s n="s1.2;p124.142">
<hi rend="sup">8</hi> Walsh (2003) also introduces the existence of velocity shocks which might affect the rate of inflation. </s>

</p>
<p n="p126.142">
<s n="s1.3;p126.142">
<hi rend="sup">10</hi> It is worth highlighting that it is assumed the policymaker behaves with discretion as much as he can. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p126.142">Nevertheless, this assumption may not be necessarily true, as McCallum (1995, pp. 208-209) points out "(...) the inexistence of a technology for inescapably precommiting future behaviour does not imply that such behaviour is infeasible...what is needed is for the CB...to recognize that its objectives would be more fully achieved on average if it were to abstain from attempts to exploit these temporarily given expectations (...)." </s>

<s n="s3.3;p132.142">In the analysis pointed out byEijffinger and Hoeberichts (1998) and Bergeral. (2001), implicitly, full instrument independence is needed inorder to obtain an objective function with the preferences of the conservative policymaker defined in the Rogoff(1985)'s model. </s>
