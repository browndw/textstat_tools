<p n="p1.13">
<s n="s1.1;p1.13">Everyone surrounding Jessica cheered loudly with more enthusiasm than she thought she'd ever felt during her entire life. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.13">
<s n="s1.5;p2.13">Jessica was fourteen, and her elder sister Emma who was sixteen had just won her third race at the school Sports Day. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p2.13">She had been elected Sports' Captain of their house at school. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p2.13">Jessica had voted for her too, despite being so jealous of how wonderful everyone thought her sister was. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p2.13">She thought Emma was wonderful too, but something inside prevented her from feeling more pleased for her. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p2.13">Part of her even wished someone else had won the vote. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.13">
<s n="s1.7;p3.13">Phased by everything that was going on around her, Jessica imagined how it might feel if she were Emma. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p3.13">All of her friends, and even those people who weren't her friends would cheer for her, and they'd all know who Jessica Beechams was. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p3.13">All the boys would fancy her and the girls would want to be her. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p3.13">She imagined having a warm feeling inside her that would make the rest of her glow with confidence. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p3.13">She smiled at this thought, but still wished that she could be amazing at something and experience that feeling herself. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p3.13">Everyone - her friends and family - were all so proud of Emma, including Jessica. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p3.13">If only everyone could be proud of her too. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.13">
<s n="s1.4;p4.13">Jessica had never been very good at any sport, or anything that involved coordinating different parts of her body at the same time. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p4.13">During P.E. lessons she often felt a cold, painful shiver that rooted from the bottom of her spine and shot right the way up to the crown of her head. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p4.13">It was almost as if someone had prodded her with a sharp pin. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p4.13">It always felt to Jessica that everyone was watching her and to their amusement, comparing her to her sister. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.13">
<s n="s1.2;p5.13">Emma, having noticed Jessica sitting alone, ran over still panting from the 200m hurdle race. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p5.13">"You ok Jess?" she sighed with exhaustion, bringing Jessica back from her fantasy world, "why are you all on your own?" </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.13">
<s n="s1.1;p6.13">"Sorry, I never noticed" she replied, suddenly realising that the crowd she had sat amongst had rapidly dispersed elsewhere. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.13">
<s n="s1.2;p7.13">"I was just worried when I saw you here all on your own." </s>
<s n="s2.2;p7.13">Emma had just about caught her breath and pulled her sister up from the dried up grass. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.13">
<s n="s1.2;p8.13">"You did really well Em, "Jessica replied brushing the grass off her clothes, not making any eye contact with her sister. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p8.13">Feeling a little awkward, she was almost glad when a year eleven boy, whose name she didn't know, ran over to collect Emma for the prize giving. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.13">
<s n="s1.5;p9.13">Emma ran in her black gym shorts and red polo neck t-shirt towards the stage that had been built on the edge of the school field. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p9.13">Jessica sometimes wished that Emma wasn't so nice. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p9.13">If she was horrible then people wouldn't like her so much. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p9.13">They would tell Jessica that it didn't matter how good her sister was because she was the nice one. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p9.13">But Emma had always been a great sister, and they had become even closer since their parents had split up. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.13">
<s n="s1.3;p10.13">For a moment, Jessica felt almost invisible. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p10.13">She stood alone in the middle of the huge school sports field seemingly unnoticed. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p10.13">Composing herself, she shook her head of thin, mousy blonde hair and opened her dull grey eyes as wide as she could before following Emma to the playground. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.13">
<s n="s1.10;p11.13">She managed to find her class and sat down next to her best friend, Amy. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p11.13">The results of every race were announced, including the year nine relay race that Jessica had been made to run in. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p11.13">It was compulsory for everyone to participate in an event. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p11.13">The relay seemed a good option as it was over quickly and she wasn't the only one running. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p11.13">Their team had come second, which was good, but not good enough, she thought to herself. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p11.13">Emma would have come first. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p11.13">One of the boys in Jessica's class, Lawrence, turned around saying that she ran like a chicken and couldn't understand why anyone chose <hi rend="italic">her</hi> to run. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p11.13">She knew instantly she'd gone bright red from the way her cheeks began to burn, as if boiling water was being poured slowly down her face. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p11.13">She held her breath to hold her tears back and eventually replied, "Who said I wanted to run anyway - idiot!" </s>
<s n="s10.10;p11.13">Later on she wished she could have thought of something better, but Amy had laughed and made a few comments about Lawrence's own efforts. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.13">
<s n="s1.6;p12.13">Jessica's house came first overall. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p12.13">The whole school watched as Emma climbed gracefully up onto the stage to collect the winners' cup. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p12.13">It had been decorated with yellow ribbons for their house, which were tied to both handles. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p12.13">She shook hands with the headmistress firmly. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p12.13">Then, glowing with pride, and smiling at everyone, she held the trophy cup high above her head. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p12.13">The whole house jumped to their feet cheering and clapping ecstatically, whilst all the others sat and clapped, mournfully staring at the winners and quietly chatting amongst themselves. </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.13">
<s n="s1.14;p13.13">Jessica watched in admiration as Emma descended into the crowd to be greeted by hugs and kisses. </s>
<s n="s2.14;p13.13">Everyone lifted her up into the air like a real champion. </s>
<s n="s3.14;p13.13">The sun shone around her and was reflected sharply by the trophy she held so tightly. </s>
<s n="s4.14;p13.13">Jessica looked up and smiled silently. </s>
<s n="s5.14;p13.13">Standing still, she could almost feel the ground move as everyone jumped up and down with excitement. </s>
<s n="s6.14;p13.13">She could feel their soft cotton t-shirts brushing against her arms. </s>
<s n="s7.14;p13.13">The muggy smell of fresh spring grass, mixed with the sweaty muddy odours of everyone around her, seemed strangely sweet. </s>
<s n="s8.14;p13.13">The noise of her friends shouting and screaming gradually became muted. </s>
<s n="s9.14;p13.13">Jessica felt an odd feeling in the pit of her stomach which grew upwards and settled in the back of her throat. </s>
<s n="s10.14;p13.13">She swallowed what seemed to be the size of a tennis ball and sighed to herself. </s>
<s n="s11.14;p13.13">Suddenly, she felt guilty and selfish because she couldn't feel completely happy for her sister. </s>
<s n="s12.14;p13.13">Secretly she still wished that she could do something to make people cheer and look up to her in the same way. </s>
<s n="s13.14;p13.13">Clenching her teeth together and swallowing her envy, Jessica rejoined the excitement. </s>
<s n="s14.14;p13.13">She jumped up and down with her friends and cheered loudly for Emma and their house team. </s>
