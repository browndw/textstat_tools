<s n="s1.8;p4.17">By looking at the extract alone there are aspects of language which can be observed and used to create meaning on a basic level. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p4.17">Like much of Shakespeare's work, the monologue is written in iambic pentameter. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p4.17">This encourages a rhythm which emphasises significant words, thus evoking both mood and meaning. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p4.17">The syntax used within the lines also aids this. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p4.17">In the first line, for instance, the repeated word 'cause' is given natural emphasis from its place within the rhythmic pattern. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p4.17">Moreover, the caesurae within the line suggest that the speaker (Othello) is in some kind of confused torment; the syntax used gives emphasis on the 'is' in the second part of the line. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p4.17">A structuralist reading of these lines suggests justification. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p4.17">However, since this 'cause' is not identified within the monologue itself, a complete understanding cannot be achieved without the context of the play. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.17">
<s n="s1.8;p5.17">The work of Claude LÃ©vi - Strauss on the structure of the myth recognised that although there was no 'separate and inherent meaning', the text [the <hi rend="italic">parole</hi>] could 'be understood by considering its position in the whole cycle (the <hi rend="italic">langue</hi>)...'<ref target="BAWE_3006b-ftnote.004"/>
<hi rend="italic">Othello</hi> is a tragedy in genre, and Othello the tragic hero. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p5.17">Thus, like the myth, the play can be understood in terms of its genre. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p5.17">By understanding Shakespearean tragedy it is possible to identify 'the cause' without the context of the play, as one of three things, as identified by Aristotle: revenge, ambition or <hi rend="italic">de casibus</hi>. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p5.17">The following lines confirm that it is the first that is driving Othello. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p5.17">The tragic hero must embody certain attributes in order to make him tragic. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p5.17">The most poignant of these is the tragic flaw, or folly, which takes hold of the protagonist. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p5.17">Othello's folly is jealousy and by taking into account the play's genre it is possible to grasp a basic understanding of the nature of the play. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p5.17">However, a structuralist reading on this level is limited and more detailed observations need to be made. </s>

<s n="s4.5;p6.17">A structuralist reading, which takes into account the binary structure might suggest that Othello is still protesting with himself. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p6.17">The way in which he refuses to name the cause (5.2.2) suggests that the tragic hero cannot accept the thought of being separated from Desdemona by killing her. <ref target="BAWE_3006b-ftnote.005"/> </s>
