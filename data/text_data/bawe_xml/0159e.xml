<s n="s1.4;p3.52">It is convinced that many academic textbooks and journals articles concern with the necessary features which creative organizations need. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p3.52">For example, (Amabile, 1998) focused on the three components of creativity and concluded six approaches for organizations to manage it; (Robinson, Hackett, 1997) paid attention to the hard work of creative process and the approaches that how to articulate the process to organizational culture rather than individual; (Meyer, 2000) illustrated several case studies of design companies to explain four elements integration for managing a creative environment. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p3.52">Dougherty reviewed previous literatures of innovation and developed a advanced process for translating production innovation into organizational items. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p3.52">Compared to above normal point of view journals, (Sutton, 2001) summarized absolutely different and weird rules for managing creative organizations from perspectives of hiring, management, risk and randomness. </s>

<s n="s4.6;p5.52">As a colligate part of organization work process, creativity is not invention based on nothing, but is transformation or improvement of something which is comprehended thoroughly. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p5.52">It is regarded as a process or conditions of environment which make new ideas for possible innovation are developed. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p5.52">Organization structure is the crucial part of for this level view. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.52">
<s n="s1.4;p6.52">Amabile is an expert of organization research for about 30 years. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p6.52">He concluded six key categories for managing creativity as organization level. </s>

<s n="s1.1;p7.52">Challenge of corporate groups </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.52">
<s n="s1.8;p8.52">(Amabile, 1998) introduced that internal motivation is the most influenced element of the three elements of creativity. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p8.52">As organizational level, the challenge for creative management is that manager should allocate the suitable staff to do match job. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p8.52">The effective allocation means that the job can use people's professional knowledge and creative thinking skills. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p8.52">The most important issue is that the most match job will intensive staff's maximum motivation. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p8.52">(Meyer, 2000) pointed that managers should lead a corporate behavior group in the products innovation process. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p8.52">It means that no single staff can complete all need to be done, and a creative process need all staffs to corporate together. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p8.52">Managers should understand every staff well both on skills and personalities before the whole process. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p8.52">Both the literatures focused on the staff's perspective as challenge of creative organization management. </s>
</p>

</p>
<p n="p10.52">
<s n="s1.10;p10.52">When studying about freedom, it doesn't mean that managers leave the whole team without any target. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p10.52">(Amabile, 1998) denoted that the organization leaders should set clear strategic targets and give fully autonomy of the process to staffs which will inspire more creativity. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p10.52">The freedom process leads employees to use their professional knowledge and creative thinking skills. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p10.52">Meanwhile, they will exert all their power of motivation and responsibility of ownership to do achieve the goal. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p10.52">Of course, the freedom need a condition called "self management" which suggested by (Meyer, 2000). </s>

</p>
<p n="p12.52">
<s n="s1.10;p12.52">Two main resources have been mentioned in Amabile's research about creativity in 1998: time and money. </s>

<s n="s3.10;p12.52">Time schedule could not be too rush or too long and need to fit the project's requirement. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p12.52">In the same way, managers should not allocate other resources such as money so tight that staffs will cost time to find additional resources. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p12.52">On the contrary, too much resource also can't cause creativity. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p12.52">In addition, he argued that the traditional concept which is important to create a physical space for teams is not crucial. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p12.52">Mangers should pay more attention to other initiative actions than this issue. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p12.52">(Robinson and Hackett, 1997) had opposite perspective about workspace as Amabile's. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p12.52">They illustrated a case study of a designer and manufactory furniture company. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p12.52">By the changing of workplace for leadership from private room to an open informal community room, the team increased communication and speed for any change decision making for whole organization. </s>

<s n="s1.1;p13.52">Work group features </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.52">
<s n="s1.9;p14.52">(Amabile, 1998) suggested that a creative team should have mulriple skills and backgrounds which may have different thinking methods and professional areas to encourage creativity. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p14.52">Furthermore, people in the team should share their experience with others, kindly and helpful for others, and appreciate others' skills. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p14.52">(Sutton, 2001) had the similar opinion as him and embarked to study this issue from the radical step of hiring employees. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p14.52">It is well known that employer prefer to hire quick learner of company culture and they are in need for the company and have similar style with the managers. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p14.52">On the contrary, Sutton argued for a weird theory that organizations should hire slow learner of company code who may bring out some new idea in the process of learning. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p14.52">He gave an example of Xerox laser printer Company's innovation to support his viewpoint. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p14.52">He also suggested two other ways to increase possibility for creativity. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p14.52">One is to employ people who the managers don't like and feel uncomfortable. </s>

<s n="s3.6;p16.52">They should realize and acknowledge innovative efforts by individuals and teams. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p16.52">(Sutton, 2001) mentioned this point in his article called "The weird Rules of Creativity" again. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p16.52">He thought that the reward policy should not only for successful innovation efforts, but also for failure. </s>

<s n="s2.11;p18.52">Organizational support is the radical and strongest power to encourage creativity. </s>

<s n="s7.11;p18.52">This situation will cause staff's attention away from work. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p18.52">(Robinson and Hackett, 1997) study this issue from different aspect. </s>
<s n="s9.11;p18.52">They supposed that the first step for organizations to support creative action is to understand the field which creative action is. </s>
<s n="s10.11;p18.52">Then it should connect the field's structure with the real operation work. </s>

<s n="s5.10;p23.52">In reality, the process is constrained and controlled by management. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p23.52">Dougherty mentioned that it was difficult to balance the pressure between freedom and responsibility. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p23.52">To solve these barriers, managers should set up clear target and explain it to staffs. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p23.52">Furthermore, they will make high commitment for innovation. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p23.52">(Meyer, 2000) pointed out that self management is also a necessary skill for freedom. </s>

<s n="s11.17;p47.52">First generation process is lack of communication by the functional orientation team structure. </s>
<s n="s12.17;p47.52">Meanwhile, the review point often checked by functional managers while stage gate process's gate keepers are always senior managers. </s>
<s n="s13.17;p47.52">Stage gate process has the highest control level because of the input and output constraints of gates. </s>
<s n="s14.17;p47.52">The three processes are applied in different industries and situations. </s>
<s n="s15.17;p47.52">First generation process is often applied in aerospace or military industries because of its low technical risk and slow response for market changing. </s>
