<s n="s1.6;p1.87">Apollodorus in his speech against Neaira stated 'we have hetairai for pleasure, and pallakai for the daily service of our bodies, but wives for the production of legitimate offspring and to have reliable guardian of our household property." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_6109b-ftnote.001"/>
<s n="s2.6;p1.87">This has given rise to the idea that prostitutes in ancient Greece could be distinguished from each other, and could be clearly identified from legitimate wives. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p1.87">I believe it is possible to identify six types of prostitute, which I deem to have been easily identified in antiquity. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p1.87">One of the challenges in trying to prove the different statuses is that even though it may have been obvious at the time, it does not necessarily mean the primary source material will state it, for people do not tend to divulge information they assume their readers will already know. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p1.87">Two other difficulties are that there are no accounts written by the prostitutes themselves, and the secondary sources have never been consistent in the titles they have given prostitutes. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p1.87">Throughout translations and discussions hetairai and pallake, as well as the other terms including porne and aulētrides, have often been used to refer to all types of prostitutes, so I have had to examine each text to try and define the true meaning, and then apply the correct terminology. </s>

<s n="s2.4;p2.87">I will not be analysing temple or males through my discussion. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p2.87">This is because it is unclear whether temple prostitutes truly existed, and if they did, it is likely they occurred outside of Greece. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p2.87">McClure states that the arguments for them 'at Corinth have largely relied on Athenaeus' misreading of classical sources, particularly Pindar'.<ref target="BAWE_6109b-ftnote.002"/> The males can not be distinguished from the Athenian citizen in the same way as the females, so I would therefore have needed to treat both these types as different entities, which is outside the scope of the project. </s>

<s n="s4.6;p86.87">Through looking at the original texts, I believe a stronger argument can be made to show that there were different statuses, and the terms were not just a variety of names applied to the same sort of females. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p86.87">That is not to say it was always clear, as Neaira showed; when living with Nikarete and Timanoridas and Eucrates arguments could have been made for her being a porne or hetaira. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p86.87">If the terminology is set aside, it can always been shown that the prostitutes tried to increase their status to that of the hetaira or pallake and so this was clearly preferable to the position of auletris or porne. </s>
