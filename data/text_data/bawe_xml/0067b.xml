Early meioses form sperm, which are stored in the spermatheca. Later meioses form eggs, which are fertilized as they pass through the spermatheca. (C) Early development of the embryo. The P-lineage consists of stem cells that will eventually form the germ cells. (D) Abbreviated cell lineage chart. The number of derived cells refers to the 558 cells present in the newly hatched larva, some of which continue to divide to produce the 959 somatic cells of the adult.

<s n="s1.7;p21.32">PIE-1 is a novel 38 kDa protein whose structure is not similar to any known transcription factors, although it contains two CCCH zinc-finger domains that have been shown to bind RNA in other proteins, implicating a role in mRNA cleavage, processing and/or turnover. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p21.32">However, later studies provided evidence for a role in the direct repression of zygotic transcription by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). </s>
<s n="s3.7;p21.32">Firstly, PIE-1 is present in the nucleus as well as the cytoplasm (Mello <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s4.7;p21.32">, 1996). </s>
<s n="s5.7;p21.32">Secondly, PIE-1 disappears from the germline shortly after division of P4 into Z2 and Z3, coinciding with the onset of zygotic transcription, as determined by the appearance of the H5 phosphoepitope on the carboxyl-terminal domain of RNAPII (RNAPII-H5). </s>
<s n="s6.7;p21.32">Somatic blastomeres acquire the ability to transcribe new mRNA minutes after separation from the germ lineage, and furthermore, newly transcribed mRNAs are additionally detected in germline blastomeres in <hi rend="italic">pie-1</hi> mutants (Fig 5). </s>
<s n="s7.7;p21.32">Also, the ectopic expression of PIE-1 in somatic cells by transformation of the <hi rend="italic">pie-1</hi> gene fused to a heat shock promoter represses embryonic transcription (Seydoux &amp; Strome, 1999). </s>
</p>
<p n="p22.32">
<s n="s1.9;p22.32">It is suggested that PIE-1 suppresses the action of maternally encoded transcription factors such as SKN-1 from activating zygotic genes that promote somatic fates through the general repression of mRNA transcription by RNAPII in germline blastomeres, thus protecting the germline fate. </s>

<s n="s7.9;p22.32">Unexpectedly, instead of transcriptional initiation, PIE-1 inhibits transcriptional elongation. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p22.32">The process of elongation requires phosphorylation by CDK9 (a cyclin-dependent kinase, associated with cyclin T in the P-TEFb complex) of the RNAPII-H5 phosphoepitope. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p22.32">In transfected mammalian HeLa cells, PIE-1 inhibits CDK9, through a sequence (YAPMAPT) similar to the repeated heptapepide sequence in the RNAPII C-terminal domain (YSPTSPS) and that apparently competes for CDK9 (Zhang et al., 2003; Strome, 2005). </s>
