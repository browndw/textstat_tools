<s n="s2.3;p1.25">From studying these various forms of electron transport in respiration, it was concluded that electron transport in bacteria and in mitochondria are similar in the following respects: the electron carriers are arranged in an order of increasingly more positive reduction potential and the energy released in electron transport is utilised to generate a proton motive force, used to synthesise ATP. </s>

<p n="p2.25">
<s n="s1.5;p2.25">The electron transport in respiration is a process by which electrons are transferred from an electron donor, such as NADH, to an electron acceptor, for example oxygen, through a sequence of membrane-associated electron carriers. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p2.25">This transfer releases energy, allowing for the pumping of protons across the cell membrane, creating an electrochemical gradient. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p2.25">The resulting proton motive force allows for the synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p2.25">Although details such as electron carriers used differ, this general process is present in all eukaryotes and prokaryotes as a form of producing ATP. For example, bacteria that have electron transport chains very similar to mitochondria's include <hi rend="italic">Rickettsia</hi> <hi rend="italic">prowazekii</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Paracoccus</hi> <hi rend="italic">denitrificans</hi>. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p3.25">Bacteria that have electron transport chains less similar to the mitochondrial electron transport chain, for example those using different electron donors including hydrogen oxidising bacteria and sulfur oxidising bacteria, are also considered in this essay among others. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p3.25">In addition, anaerobic respiration in bacteria, with nitrate and sulfur as a final electron acceptors are also described, including comparison with the electron transport chain in mitochondria. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p3.25">Finally, a bacterium that does not use an electron transport chain is briefly described to illustrate the diversity found in the bacterial respiration system and that an electron transport chain is not essential for ATP synthesis. </s>

<head rend="underlined">Conclusion</head>
<p n="p19.25">
<s n="s1.1;p19.25">Although only a fraction of bacteria have been considered in this essay, it has allowed for the diversity of processes which exist to produce ATP to be illustrated, from bacteria that have electron transport chains very similar to mitochondrial electron transport such as in <hi rend="italic">R. prowazekii</hi> and <hi rend="italic">P. denitrificans</hi> to those that have a very different electron transport chain, such as a sulfur reducing bacterium. </s>
</p>
<p n="p20.25">
<s n="s1.1;p20.25">According to <hi rend="underlined">Brock's Biology of Microorganisms</hi>: "several features are characteristic of all electron transport chains and can be summarized as follows: </s>
</p>
<p rend="ordered" n="p21.25">
<s n="s1.1;p21.25">The presence of a series of membrane-associated electron carriers arranged in order of increasingly more positive E <hi rend="sub">0</hi>'. </s>
</p>
<p rend="ordered" n="p22.25">
<s n="s1.1;p22.25">An alternation in the chain of electron-only and hydrogen-atom only carriers </s>
</p>
<p rend="ordered" n="p23.25">
<s n="s1.2;p23.25">Generation of a proton motive force as a result of charge separation across the membrane, acidic outside and alkaline inside." </s>
<s n="s2.2;p23.25">(126~127) </s>
</p>
<p n="p24.25">
<s n="s1.5;p24.25">However, if the few types electron transport chains studied in this essay are to be considered, it can be said that many of the bacterial electron transport chain have some common electron carriers with mitochondria. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p24.25">For example, flavoproteins are not only present in mitochondria but also in <hi rend="italic">E. coli</hi> and some hydrogen oxidising bacteria. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p24.25">Moreover, in <hi rend="italic">E. coli</hi>, iron sulfur proteins are also present. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p24.25">However, by far the most common electron transporter was cytochrome c. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p24.25">All the electron transport chains considered in this essay contained some form of a cytochrome. </s>
</p>
<p n="p25.25">
<s n="s1.3;p25.25">It was surprising to discover that there is an organism that does not use an electron transport chain. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p25.25">The electron transport chain was possibly lost through evolution, where using a certain substrate meant that it was more efficient to use another method of ATP formation than the usual electron transport chain to produce a proton motive force. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p25.25">Nevertheless, the similarities of electron transport chain between all other bacteria suggest that the electron transport chain of the bacteria studied and indeed the mitochondria have a common lineage, but due to selective pressures, such as availability of various oxidation and reduction agents, certain changes have been favoured over others. </s>
