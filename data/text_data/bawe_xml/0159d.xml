<s n="s2.11;p2.80">Its business is focus on designing and producing seating system for cars and has a big range of brand car plants, such as Toyota, BMW, Land Rover, and Peugeot. </s>
<s n="s3.11;p2.80">Approximately 200 employees work in shop floor and 30 staffs in office for marketing and sales, R&amp;D, IT, finance and so on. </s>
<s n="s4.11;p2.80">Half of the shop floor employees are fully skilled machinists and rest of them are semi-skilled machine minders. </s>
<s n="s5.11;p2.80">The shop floor still uses traditional manufacturing processes and machines. </s>
<s n="s6.11;p2.80">Due to the huge revolution in automotive industry that manufacturing changed from batch production to lean production, the company lost its business and has become unprofitable. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p2.80">It adopted "make to stock" strategy to product with high volume batch for productivity. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p2.80">The machines are comparatively old and automation extent is low. </s>
<s n="s9.11;p2.80">All main procedures are done by operators. </s>
<s n="s10.11;p2.80">Raw materials are supplied by many suppliers which locate in UK. Quality control procedure is that operators inspect the finished products and remove wasters. </s>
<s n="s11.11;p2.80">The plant layout is based process and operators are reward by pieces work. </s>

<div2>
<head>1.2 Original manufacturing strategy of company</head>
<p n="p3.80">
<s n="s1.3;p3.80">In the past, top management were lack of manufacturing experience and believed that manufacturing management is subordinate in strategy making to marketing and finance functions. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p3.80">Therefore, manufacturing management was focus on short term performance issues and tasks. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p3.80">The most important pressure to meet day to day operation target caused production managers to consider themselves features and ignore the cooperating manufacturing strategy with whole business strategy. </s>

<div2>
<head>2.1Manufacturing strategy academic definition and framework</head>
<p n="p5.80">
<s n="s1.1;p5.80">(Hayes and Wheelwright, 1984) gave a clear definition for manufacturing strategy: </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.80">
<s n="s1.1;p6.80">The primary function of a manufacturing strategy is to guide the business in putting together the set of manufacturing capabilities that will enable it to pursue its chosen competitive strategy over the long term. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.80">
<s n="s1.10;p7.80">In other words, manufacturing strategy can give a company a competitive advantage. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p7.80">During the past years, manufacturing strategy's role has changed absolutely. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p7.80">The cooperation strategy was focus on marketing and finance as competitive advantage and manufacturing was a tool to implement it before 1980s. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p7.80">Then, manufacturing was gradually considered as a part of cooperation strategy and can provide competitive advantage for companies. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p7.80">(Terry, 2000) explained more about its two important roles as part of the strategic strengths of a company. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p7.80">The first is to provide outstanding manufacturing process with unique technology and operations which is hard to be replicated by competitors. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p7.80">It can be an advantage in marketplace. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p7.80">The other one is that the manufacturing support product to win orders better than its competitors. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p7.80">The infrastructures and process of manufacturing must be consistent with existing product order winners and flexible for future changing business needs. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p7.80">(Hayes and Wheelwright, 1984) defined four developments stages in manufacturing strategic role as following: </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.80">
<s n="s1.5;p8.80">Stage1 is internal neutral. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p8.80">Companies in stage 1 have very limited view of what manufacturing can do for business. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p8.80">Manufacturing here is not as strategic role and emphasis on daily operation, expense control and utilization of labor or machines. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p8.80">It absolutely subordinate to marketing and finance and need to remain flexibility for market fluctuation. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p8.80">In addition, these plants are lack of leadership and management ability and have comparative low skilled workforce. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.80">
<s n="s1.6;p9.80">Stage 2 called externally neutral. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p9.80">In this stage companies adopt some practice of normal industry which means important changes can be communicated relative quickly. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p9.80">Top management still have simple concept of manufacturing and pay attention to technology and capital investment. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p9.80">The manufacturing investment is the most possible part to be cut or reduced especially on the wage to labor. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p9.80">They pursue internal standard and economic of scales for productivity. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p9.80">Above all, manufacturing begin to be considered as part of whole business and interact with other function at some extent. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.80">
<s n="s1.11;p10.80">When moving to stage3 which is internally supportive, the biggest chance of organization's view is that manufacturing begin to support the objective of business. </s>
<s n="s2.11;p10.80">Senior managers must try to understand the whole business and make decision or long term plan of manufacturing to effect on organization. </s>
<s n="s3.11;p10.80">The manufacturing decisions such as capability, process, scope, flexibility must match the realistic business situation. </s>
<s n="s4.11;p10.80">As production managers, they need to change the attitude from reactive to proactive and pay more attention to strategy. </s>
<s n="s5.11;p10.80">Their skills include not only daily operations control, but also understanding ability to business and strong personnel communications competence with other functions. </s>
<s n="s6.11;p10.80">It's not means that the daily operations aren't important. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p10.80">The strategy and operations both reflect comparative impact of business performance and need to be done well by managers. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p10.80">Stage 4 is represents as externally supportive. </s>
<s n="s9.11;p10.80">Here manufacturing roles and organization are totally changed. </s>
<s n="s10.11;p10.80">Companies pursue manufacturing as competitive advantage. </s>
<s n="s11.11;p10.80">It is an equal partner with other functions for making decision and formulating business strategy. </s>

<head>2.2Analysis of the company and completing manufacturing strategy</head>
<p n="p12.80">
<s n="s1.3;p12.80">According to the background and originally strategy of Macgregor, it is obviously to find that the company's manufacturing strategy was in the stage2 from Hayes and Wheelwright's definition. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p12.80">The new manufacturing strategy should move to the stage 3 to support the objective of business instead of a tool for marketing and finance. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p12.80">To decide a new manufacturing strategy, the first step is to analysis the whole marketing position. </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.80">
<s n="s1.3;p13.80">John Puttick's market segmentation grid is a useful and classic framework to identify the industry's marketing position. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p14.80">Since manufacturing strategy is in line with cooperation strategy and needs to provide competitive advantage for marketing, it will focus on one quadrant to position products range. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p14.80">Each quadrant has typical demand of business process and competences. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p14.80">The high complexity and low uncertainty quadrant focus on knowledge acquisition, product supply flexibility, time to market and flexible manufacturing according to John's theory. </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.80">
<s n="s1.1;p15.80">(Skinner, 1978) gave the basic ideas of manufacturing strategy's function is that it should provide two of the following seven order winning criteria: </s>

<p n="p17.80">
<s n="s1.4;p17.80">The next step is to match manufacturing with order winner criteria for assuring manufacturing strategy decision can delivery the winner criteria. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p17.80">First of all, the decision makers choose a framework to breakdown manufacturing area into categories such as Hayes and Wheelwright's. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p17.80">Then they need to identify which elements are most impact the order winner criteria and have highest priority to be improved. </s>

<s n="s4.12;p24.80">The main problem is to decide the relationship between amount of capacity and demand. </s>
<s n="s5.12;p24.80">Should the capacity is based on expectant demand or the existing demand? </s>
<s n="s6.12;p24.80">Here in automotive component industry, most of world class manufactories adopt lean manufacturing which means producing right productions with right material at right time. </s>
<s n="s7.12;p24.80">It determines the company's amount of capacity should depend on demand rather than lead demand. </s>
<s n="s8.12;p24.80">In other words, the company uses "make to order" management tools to control the capacity. </s>
<s n="s9.12;p24.80">It is a relative traditional method and requires less investment than normal. </s>
