<s n="s1.1;p1.10">While it is certain that the reformation which set off in the twenties of the fifteenth century was preceded by more than a century of humanism challenging, among other things, man's attitude toward theological issues, the extent and influence of the humanist movement are still a matter of debate.<ref target="BAWE_0003f-ftnote.001"/> While it has been asserted that humanist thought centred around the capabilities of the human as gifts of God, as opposed to the middle age view of man as 'a humble, fallen creature under the permanent curse of original sin',<ref target="BAWE_0003f-ftnote.002"/> the unity of the humanist agenda has to a large extent been exaggerated, and the various strands of humanism across Europe 'do not appear to have adopted a coherent position on matters of substance'.<ref target="BAWE_0003f-ftnote.003"/> What does emerge upon careful assessment, though, is a general set of new attitudes and principles, often contrasting those of the medieval scholastic movement which is shared by both the humanist and reformer.<ref target="BAWE_0003f-ftnote.004"/> Moreover, a careful assessment of the general theological position inherent in most of humanist thought must be contrasted to that of the reformers' movement to come to a fuller appreciation of how humanism came to influence reforming thought and vice versa.<ref target="BAWE_0003f-ftnote.005"/> </s>

<s n="s1.5;p2.10">The coming of humanism to Germany virtually coincided with the founding of the first German university in Prague.<ref target="BAWE_0003f-ftnote.006"/> Indeed, the establishment of universities brought a fresh outlook to the studies of theology and morals, entrenching the humanist tradition (<hi rend="italic">studia humanitatis</hi>) ever firmer into German scholarly attitudes.<ref target="BAWE_0003f-ftnote.007"/> By the beginning of the sixteenth century, sixteen university had been founded across the German lands,<ref target="BAWE_0003f-ftnote.008"/> which in various degrees pursued the methods of a new kind of studies. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p2.10">Professors of the <hi rend="italic">studia humanitatis</hi> stressed text-based studies, thereby aiming to gain powerful and valuable insights of Christian religion brought back to a purer interpretation of the biblical text. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p2.10">Their slogan <hi rend="italic">ad fontes</hi> signified, most importantly, an attempt to get closer to the true intention of the scriptures.<ref target="BAWE_0003f-ftnote.009"/> Moreover, the <hi rend="italic">via moderna</hi>, as this new interpretation of religion came to be called, also challenged the minutely derived rationalist viewpoints of medieval theologians (known as the <hi rend="italic">via antiqua</hi>) by stressing the value of human experience and interpretation.<ref target="BAWE_0003f-ftnote.010"/> For example, the German philologist and humanist Rudolf Agricola sought to explore this in his writing. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p2.10">Thus, he came to assert: 'Prodigious, immense, and unbelievable is the power of the human mind'.<ref target="BAWE_0003f-ftnote.011"/> A renewed strong interest with secular Latin and Greek authors derived directly from the humanists' concern with the reform of language into clear uncomplicated formulations so as to arrive at more logical conclusions. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p2.10">Such linguistic reform the humanists found through 'the observation and imitation of the best authors and writers',<ref target="BAWE_0003f-ftnote.012"/> classics such as 'Virgil, Lucan, Horace [...], Plautus, Terence, Cicero, Sallust, Seneca, and the Roman historian Valerius Maximus'. <ref target="BAWE_0003f-ftnote.013"/> </s>

<s n="s1.2;p3.10">It goes without saying that, by permitting themselves such a new, revisionist outlook, the northern European humanists soon came to criticise what they considered unjustified behaviour within the church and among all Christians in general, be it while viewing themselves inside the religious order and thus without calling into doubt the authority of the church.<ref target="BAWE_0003f-ftnote.014"/> Still, in many respects, humanism undermined the absolute authority of the church organisation, stressing the humble, speculative element of religious life. </s>

<s n="s1.8;p4.10">By the time Luther came in conflict with the church, humanism had become well engendered in Germany. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p4.10">But besides the Italian humanist influences of text-based study, German humanists furthermore came to incorporate the creation of a distinct German identity in their writing. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p4.10">Around the turn of the century, several texts were published praising Germany's pious and learned traditions, with at its foundation the rediscovering of Tacitus' <hi rend="italic">Germania</hi> in 1455.<ref target="BAWE_0003f-ftnote.016"/> It was within this tradition that the greatest reformers received their education. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p4.10">The studies of Zwingli in Vienna, the Swiss reformer, coincided with the arrival to that city of Conrad Celtis, Germany's poet laureate, while Luther regarded humanist techniques of philology and the close study of the scriptures as the key to his theological discoveries. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p4.10">Similarly, Calvin, a decade later, would be grounded in the study of <hi rend="italic">bonae litterae</hi>.<ref target="BAWE_0003f-ftnote.017"/> Yet, the position of the reformers went beyond that of the humanists in theological zeal and single-mindedness.<ref target="BAWE_0003f-ftnote.018"/> While most humanists agreed that '[t]he irreducible particularity of human reality was [...] more suited to historical description, rather than logical analysis',<ref target="BAWE_0003f-ftnote.019"/> they proposed as a solution simply the reform of education through training in rhetoric and the study of 'ancient philosophers, poets and orators', as Celtis argued already in 1492.<ref target="BAWE_0003f-ftnote.020"/> The differences in point of view of reformers like Luther and Zwingli initially appeared rather blurred to many humanists, which in effect strengthened their case. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p4.10">It was this 'productive misunderstanding' which made a great controversy out of Luther's theological uneasy with some of the church's practices.<ref target="BAWE_0003f-ftnote.021"/> The theoretical misunderstanding is to some extent no surprise. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p4.10">Humanists and reformers alike shared many principles which clothed the doctrinal move away from the church in humanist language. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p4.10">Thus, when Luther wrote of his breakthrough in the theory of justification, that '[h]itherto, this epistle has been smothered with comments and all sorts of irrelevances, yet, in essence, it is a brillant light, almost enough to illuminate the whole bible',<ref target="BAWE_0003f-ftnote.022"/> this certainly bore the semblance of the humanists' study of the scriptures <hi rend="italic">ad fontes</hi>. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p5.10">Historians have argued that '[t]o a certain extent, the reformers were simply confirming the advances made by the Humanist agenda, with its stress on ancient languages, its tools of exegesis and its approval to the sources'.<ref target="BAWE_0003f-ftnote.023"/> This assertion rings a certain truth, in that humanists were quite ready to speak out against any kind of practice which they considered a perversion of the true faith. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p5.10">Consequently, we find that Erasmus freely criticised the incorporation of pagan elements into the Christian faith, and the complicity of the clergy in these practices: 'so it be of ghosts, spirits, goblins, devils, or the like; [...] the further they are from truth, the more readily they are believed and the more do they tickle their itching ears. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p5.10">And these serve not only to pass away time but bring profit, especially to mass priests and pardoners'.<ref target="BAWE_0003f-ftnote.024"/> Furthermore, he criticised the fact that selling indulgences evaded the simple fact that 'to live well is the way to die well'.<ref target="BAWE_0003f-ftnote.025"/> While humanist and reformer alike stressed the simple and direct relationship in which the individual stood to God, the period directly preceding the reformation saw the sweeping popularity of so-called sacramentals, small objects that were to have sacred protective powers, turning the religious experience into 'a kind of popular Catholic version of the priesthood of all believers'.<ref target="BAWE_0003f-ftnote.026"/> Catholic theologians were quick to assert that the working of sacramentals worked, not through physical efficacy; rather, it was spiritual efficacy, based on the prayers of the church',<ref target="BAWE_0003f-ftnote.027"/> yet, Luther attacked the very authority of the church as an intermediary between the individual and God. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p5.10">'How much more properly did the apostles call themselves servants of the present Christ', he wrote in an open letter to pope Leo X, 'and not [like the clergy] vicars of an absent Christ?'.<ref target="BAWE_0003f-ftnote.028"/> Such boldness did certainly lie outside the tradition of pre-reformation humanists, who, despite their criticism, were nearly all 'men who saw themselves as operating within the context of the church'. <ref target="BAWE_0003f-ftnote.029"/> </s>

<s n="s1.5;p9.10">To conclude, the role of humanism in preparing the ground enabling a reformation to take place in Germany and the rest of northern Europe was very great. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p9.10">Despite the fact that many a humanist was, and remained, supportive of the church in Rome, the humanist challenges to education, thereby firmly establishing the <hi rend="italic">studia humanitatis</hi> around Europe, was of tremendous importance for the theological and social atmosphere to bring about further-going criticism of the church institutions. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p9.10">Moreover, many of the humanist values were shared by the reformation movement. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p9.10">The emphasis on text-based studies was of key importance to Luther (<hi rend="italic">sola scriptura</hi>), while the study of classical Greek and Latin texts enabled Zwingli to successfully challenge the church's position on several matters.<ref target="BAWE_0003f-ftnote.046"/> Both humanists and reformers criticised the incorporation of pagan elements such as sacramentals, which they considered charms, and the church's trade of indulgences. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p9.10">Indeed, Luther's ideas and style of criticism of the church bore such semblance to humanist traditions, that the first period of clash saw the support of many humanists, which has been described as a 'productive misunderstanding', which, additionally, brought much attention to the Wittenberg disputation through the humanists' extensive correspondence network. </s>
