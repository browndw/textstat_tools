<p>The British Academic Written English (BAWE) corpus was developed at the Universities of Warwick, Reading and Oxford Brookes, under the directorship of Hilary Nesi and Sheena Gardner (formerly of the Centre for Applied Linguistics [previously called CELTE], Warwick), Paul Thompson (Department of Applied Linguistics, Reading) and Paul Wickens (Westminster Institute of Education, Oxford Brookes), with funding from the ESRC. Subject to the rights of the these institutions in the BAWE corpus, and pursuant to the ESRC agreement, the BAWE corpus is available to researchers for research purposes PROVIDED THAT the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>1. The corpus files are not distributed in either their original form or in modified form.</p>
<p>2. The texts are used for research purposes only; they should not be reproduced in teaching materials.</p>
<p>3. The texts are not reproduced in full for a wider audience/readership, although researchers are free to quote short passages of text (up to 200 running words from any given text).</p>
<p>4. The BAWE corpus developers (contact: BAWE@warwick.ac.uk) are informed of all projects, dissertations, theses, presentations or publications arising from analysis of the corpus.</p>
<p>5. Researchers acknowledge their use of the corpus using the following form of words: "The data in this study come from the British Academic Written English (BAWE) corpus, which was developed at the Universities of Warwick, Reading and Oxford Brookes under the directorship of Hilary Nesi and Sheena Gardner (formerly of the Centre for Applied Linguistics [previously called CELTE], Warwick), Paul Thompson (Department of Applied Linguistics, Reading) and Paul Wickens (Westminster Institute of Education, Oxford Brookes), with funding from the ESRC (RES-000-23-0800)."</p>

<s n="s1.6;p1.25">Nocturnal primates of the family Galagidae have recently been under great taxonomic revision due to new discoveries concerning their behavior and morphology. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p1.25">New species are appearing at such a rapid rate that the important process of scientifically identifying and naming species has been put on the backburner. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p1.25">Effective conservation work is dependent on an updated taxonomy in order to acknowledge the width of the biodiversity one is trying to save (Grubbal. 2003; Groves, 2001). </s>
<s n="s4.6;p1.25">The proposed investigation concerns a taxonomic study of one up to four as yet scientifically unnamed primates of the genus <hi rend="italic">Galagoides</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Sciurocheirus</hi>. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p1.25">The study's main objective will be to compile sufficient amounts of character data, i.e. behavioral, morphological and genetic data, to enable the endorsement of species status independent of species concept (see Groves, 2001, for overview) applied with the specific aim as to publicly name these species in accordance with the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN, 1999) regulations. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p1.25">The data collected will also create the body of a comprehensive database over the known information of the family Galagidae. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.25">
<s n="s1.1;p2.25">The research will be carried out in several steps and with different methodologies appropriate for descriptions of new species (ICZN, 1999): </s>
</p>
<p rend="ordered" n="p3.25">
<s n="s1.3;p3.25">An exhaustive literature study where previous descriptions of the target taxa will be researched. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p3.25">The information gathered will provide important background information vital for both the choice of scientific name and for the species description. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p3.25">Characters previously used as means for species description for nocturnal, cryptic species such as penile morphology, facial masks and vocal repertoire will be of special interest but general morphological, behavioral and distributional data will also be investigated. </s>
</p>
<p rend="ordered" n="p4.25">
<s n="s1.3;p4.25">Localize museum specimens (if available) for each species to conduct morphological research. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p4.25">New specimens of primates rarely occur in museums due to export regulations for endangered species (Baillie, 2004), however, the presence of these newly discovered species often exist in museum collections under erroneous names (Bearder, pers. comm.) </s>
<s n="s3.3;p4.25">This means that valuable material is available for descriptive morphometric analysis and historical distribution. </s>
</p>
<p rend="ordered" n="p5.25">
<s n="s1.3;p5.25">Comparative analysis of recent field data including vocal recordings, behavioral data, distribution, morphology and genetics (i.e. karyotyping). </s>
<s n="s2.3;p5.25">Special emphasis will be put on vocal analysis and karyotyping since these features have been shown to be highly significant as diagnostic tools for species specification within the Galagidae family (Bearderal. 1995; Masters, 1986). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p5.25">Vocal recordings and tissue samples from the targeted species are available for analysis (Bearder, pers. comm., 2005). </s>
