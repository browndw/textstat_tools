<p n="p2.11">
<s n="s1.6;p2.11">The temperature at which the vapour pressure is equal to 1atm is the normal boiling point of that liquid. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p2.11">At some temperatures the energy of molecules is great enough for bubbles of vapour to form - the liquid boils. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p2.11">However at any lower temperature the bubbles collapse as soon as they form because the atmospheric pressure is greater than the vapour pressure inside the bubbles. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p2.11">Hence the boiling point of a liquid is the temperature at which the vapour pressure equals the external pressure. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p2.11">When varying pressure; if a lower pressure is exerted on the liquids surface, less kinetic energy is needed to form bubbles and hence the temperature of the boiling point is less than for a higher pressure. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p2.11">Boiling point therefore depends on applied pressure (Vapour pressure increases with temperature) </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.11">
<s n="s1.1;p3.11">The Clausis-Clapeyron equation relater the temperature dependence of the vapour pressure of a liquid to the heat of vaporisation and can be used to find this figure. (dIn p/d (1/T) = -ΔHvap/R). </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.11">
<s n="s1.3;p4.11">Troutons rule states that for most un-associated liquids, ΔHvap is roughly independent of temperature; this is found by, ΔHvap being roughly equal to KT <hi rend="sub">b.</hi> </s>
<s n="s2.3;p4.11">This is found to be true for most un-associated liquids other than those with extremely strong intermolecular forces, eg. </s>

<s n="s8.8;p6.11">Pressure was then adjusted (by opening pressure gauge to pump tap) in steps of 100mbar to 1000mbar and using a viewer the temperature taken when the liquid boiled freely. </s>
