<p n="p2.14">
<s n="s1.8;p2.14">Virgil takes the story of the founding of Rome and writes it using the popular media of epic poetry, both embracing and modernising Homeric technique in order to create a new type of hero relevant to a Roman society. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p2.14">This Roman hero would have to adhere to Roman virtues and reflect the Roman ideal; being pious and devout (subservient to the gods and his fate); bound by duty; devoted to family and country; and emotionally controlled. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p2.14">These traditional values were appreciated by both Virgil and Augustus, who passed laws that <hi rend="italic">"set limits to expenditure, encouraged family life, penalised sexual laxity."</hi>
<ref target="BAWE_6192b-ftnote.002"/> A most important feature is the idea of <hi rend="italic">pietas</hi>, a Latin word used to encapsulate a devotion to all virtues; the gods, family, and country. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p2.14">Aeneas fulfils these through being a devoted father and son, a devoutly pious man, putting the future of Rome above all personal desires and remaining committed to his destiny. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p2.14">In this way, Virgil is able to portray the importance of loyalty to the Roman state, an importance of morality and virtuousness, and a sense of emotional peace and control that all Romans (including Augustus) could aspire to. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p2.14">Comparing it to Greek models of heroism can help to enhance our view of Aeneas' Roman characteristics, but can also show similarities between them, occasionally bringing to the surface some of Aeneas' more Homeric tendencies. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p2.14">On the whole, Aeneas can be regarded as a predominantly Roman hero, however I believe Virgil highlights certain elements of Aeneas' character that are more Homeric and as such, unsavoury to a Roman audience. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p2.14">It could be that Virgil is trying to illustrate human weakness, and although maintains an ideal to aspire to, realises that we can never completely achieve it. </s>

</p>
</note>
<p n="p3.14">
<s n="s1.7;p3.14">We can also examine what would define Roman heroism and compare it to that of Homeric (Greek), however Virgil's presentation of his Roman hero is modelled on Homer's idea of the epic, and so similarities are frequent. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p3.14">Most often born of mortal parents, Roman heroes would be given a quest in which they must remain pious and devoted Roman citizens. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p3.14">Obstacles would be presented in the form of other mortals rather than the mythical creatures of Greek epic and must remain loyal to their country and cause. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p3.14">Greek heroes, by contrast, would be semi-divine, and fulfilling quests for personal glory and reputation. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p3.14">Aeneas bridges the two definitions in this instance, as he is semi-divine (Venus is his mother) and although his main enemies are mortals, fights a mythical being as well. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p3.14">He is presented as a rather more selfless leader than that of Greek epic, devoted to his quest for the greater good of the future of Rome. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p3.14">Although in regards to traditional Roman heroes he shares characteristics with the presentation of Greek heroes, observing Aeneas' Roman characteristics within his heroism is rather more successful. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.14">
<s n="s1.5;p4.14">Virgil's Roman heroism is at odds with the Homeric heroism of the Odyssey and Iliad. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p4.14">The ideals of Rome are reflected in the heroism that Virgil depicts in the Aeneid, emphasising family, piety and duty. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p4.14">As a result Aeneas is a rather different hero to Odysseus; Virgil intends to reflect Roman ideals to portray a model Roman citizen and encourage national pride, whereas the Homeric heroes are rather less human, and are self-serving and glory-seeking, portraying supremacy. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p4.14">Gransden summarises his heroism in describing him as <hi rend="italic">'willing and ready to subordinate his individual will to that of destiny, the commonwealth and the future, reluctant to fight and not really interested in victory.'</hi>
<ref target="BAWE_6192b-ftnote.003"/> Aeneas has some instincts of a Greek hero (these are most clearly illustrated in Books 10, 11 and 12 where he is fighting against Turnus and the Italians, upon hearing of Pallas' death and ruthlessly taking human sacrifices in anger, ((a reflection of Achilles in the Iliad when he is revenging Petroklos' death)) and upon killing Turnus when he should have showed mercy) but he has to countermand these in favour of Roman values and a selfless duty to the future state of Rome. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p4.14">Aeneas has to consider the future of an entire race of people and retain his devotion to his quest to found Rome, a far less selfish hero than that of the Homeric kind, where victory is motivated by personal glory. </s>

<p n="p5.14">
<s n="s1.7;p5.14">Aeneas cannot be an individualistic and selfish hero. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p5.14">Williams explains that he has to be <hi rend="italic">'the social man',</hi> always concerned with the good of his people in order to achieve the destiny of Rome.<ref target="BAWE_6192b-ftnote.004"/> He has to be aware of his responsibility to his duty which includes looking out for the welfare of others without submitting to his own desires or becoming selfish and self-important. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p5.14">Aeneas is often described as being <hi rend="italic">'pius'</hi>, (<hi rend="italic">pietas</hi> is the noun) a Latin word encompassing the qualities aforementioned. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p5.14">It is a concept that was a vital Roman virtue, and is probably Aeneas' most treasured quality from an Augustan perspective. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p5.14">
<hi rend="italic">Pietas</hi> incorporates an immovable devotion to the gods, ones family, ones friends and one's country (reflected in his unshakeable dedication to achieving his destiny of founding Rome). <ref target="BAWE_6192b-ftnote.005"/>
<hi rend="italic">Pietas</hi> can be coupled with the idea of self-sacrifice, another quality which Aeneas is in possession of that is notably Roman. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p5.14">This could be said to be a reflection of Augustus' interest in Stoicism and its <hi rend="italic">"strong emphasis on duty, and a stern, self-denying self control...ready to suffer and obey."</hi>
<ref target="BAWE_6192b-ftnote.006"/> His dedication to the quest, and his duty, forces him to sacrifice his personal life for the benefit of future generations and follow his divine duty to the best of his ability. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p5.14">This is particularly illustrated in Book 4 when he abandons Dido to her fate after their love affair in Carthage: </s>

<s n="s3.6;p7.14">In order to be perceived as great beings they need little human weakness, and this sets them apart from the general public. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p7.14">In contrast, Virgil's Roman hero is shown to be inherently human, despite Aeneas having a divine parent, and as such can act as a vehicle for Augustus and the Roman government to portray the model Roman citizen. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p7.14">The model Roman citizen however, requires Aeneas to become detached and prohibits emotional involvement, which could be said to dehumanise him. </s>

<p n="p8.14">
<s n="s1.1;p8.14">His subsequent self control and total devotion to his destiny are characteristically Roman; this is juxtaposed, however, with his human weaknesses early on and at the end of the poem, exemplifying how someone who is intrinsically human should master his emotions in order to fulfil the will of the gods and his destiny. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.14">
<s n="s1.7;p9.14">It is Aeneas' destiny to found Rome. </s>

<s n="s3.7;p9.14">This is exemplified in book 4 where he has to leave Dido in order to pursue his destiny in Italy and explains that <hi rend="italic">"it is not by my own will that I search for Italy."</hi> </s>
<s n="s4.7;p9.14">(Book 4, p79) It seems to be a characteristic Roman feature - to put duty to Rome above personal desires and to follow a supreme destiny as opposed to a personal quest. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p9.14">Despite Aeneas' seeming desire to stay with Dido, he still proves his dedication to his greater cause by suggesting to her that he had no intention of lingering in Carthage and that his love lies with the future of his Trojan people. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p9.14">He also backs his argument with the simple fact that leaving Carthage is beyond his control; the gods had demanded his devotion to the future of Rome. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p9.14">Despite his claims, he has the choice as to whether or not he follows his destiny, and it is by his own will that he pursues it; it is the content of his destiny he has no control over: </s>

<s n="s1.5;p13.14">Aeneas is able to express emotion and take revenge upon Turnus because he knows it will not interfere with his destiny and the good of the future Rome, and so can submit to his humanity. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p13.14">This is not to say however, that Aeneas' moment of emotional weakness can be excused, as it is so important for Aeneas as a reflection of a Roman ideal to control the passions of his emotions. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p13.14">If he is to give in to his fury, as he does here, then he jeopardises the vision of a Roman future where the civilisation Aeneas brings will stamp out the archaic need to give in to violent emotion and chaos. </s>

<s n="s3.3;p14.14">Aeneas may be characteristically Roman by majority, but Virgil seems to prove it impossible to completely adhere to Augustan ideals, perhaps a reflection of his view of Augustus' visions for the future Roman Empire, or indeed human nature in general. </s>
