<s n="s2.3;p5.31">Throughout the 1990s, overzealous intelligence estimates only gave impetus to Pyongyang's strategy. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p5.31">North Korea was 'a Rorschach inkblot absorbing anticommunist, Orientalist, and rogue state imagery', and during times of crisis 'North Korea was not our daily enemy of forty years' standing, but a new "renegade state"'.<ref target="BAWE_0255b-ftnote.008"/> </s>

<s n="s3.3;p7.31">Consequently, in the half decade between the end of the Cold War and 1994, U.S. policy was guided by a reluctance to engage North Korea, preferring to condemn and sanction the regime for transgressing international norms.<ref target="BAWE_0255b-ftnote.016"/> Throughout this period, 'North Korea was playing tit-for-tat - co-operating when the United States co-operated, retaliating when the United States reneged - in an effort to get the U.S. to negotiate in earnest'.<ref target="BAWE_0255b-ftnote.017"/> </s>

<s n="s1.4;p30.31">The historically sophisticated perspective recognises that North Korea has no fundamental flaw that will prevent it from shrugging off its dire recent past.<ref target="BAWE_0255b-ftnote.110"/> 'North Korea can be brought into the community of nations'. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p30.31">However, 'even if Pyongyang wants to go in the same direction that the West wishes it to go, that process will be cautious and halting, and North Korea will not quickly let its guard down. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p30.31">Slow change is not bad - rapid change on the peninsula will be disastrous'.<ref target="BAWE_0255b-ftnote.111"/> While Cha's contention is admirable, it still fails to recognise that the D.P.R.K will continue the same mode of coercive negotiation until it is given the security guarantees it so desperately needs.<ref target="BAWE_0255b-ftnote.112"/> In the economic arena, reforms suggest that the D.P.R.K is in fact changing the nature of its polity as well as extorting the international community in order to survive.<ref target="BAWE_0255b-ftnote.113"/> This does not mean that the Kim regime advocates "open society" or is contemplating 'wholesale economic reforms anytime soon', but it does reflect a general shift in North Korean society which marks a more optimistic opportunity to engage the outside than ever before. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p30.31">The United States would be foolish to disregard this and push for the unrealistic change its zealous political oratory and ideology demand.<ref target="BAWE_0255b-ftnote.114"/> </s>

<s n="s1.3;p31.31">In focusing on not just military North Korea, but on the country's 'political and economic behaviour in a broader historical context, there is a story to be told of slow plodding reform'. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p31.31">Despite the apparent resistance of the <hi rend="italic">Juche</hi> ideology, 'engagement works...it sends the right signals to the insecure regime that the United States, the Republic of Korea, and Japan are interested in trading the North's proliferation threat for a path of economic reform and integration'.<ref target="BAWE_0255b-ftnote.115"/> Even from the contrary, pessimistic view contingent engagement must be seen as superior to a policy of coercion or neglect which will simply force the Kim regime to take more desperate measures to survive. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p31.31">North Korea must be made to feel that incentives are more advantageous than coercive bargaining, which will potentially jeopardise its relatively propitious position.<ref target="BAWE_0255b-ftnote.116"/> In the final assessment it must be understood that 'without resolving North Korea's security fears' the crisis is never likely to abate.<ref target="BAWE_0255b-ftnote.117"/> </s>
