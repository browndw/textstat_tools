<s n="s1.3;p1.8">Corporate Governance is concerned with holding the balance between economic and social goals and between individual and communal goals. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p1.8">Its framework is there to encourage the efficient use of resources and equally to require accountability for the stewardship of those resources<ref target="BAWE_0153e-ftnote.001"/>. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p2.8">Originally, before the notion social responsibility came to stage, organisations' objectives are primarily to maximise profits and shareholders' values. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p2.8">Yet, due to the increasing impact of stakeholders on organisations, companies are beginning to address the matter profusely. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p2.8">Thus, corporate social responsibility (CSR) has become one important area in organisations, specially addressing stakeholders. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.8">
<s n="s1.6;p3.8">At one glance, companies which are socially responsible are deemed good. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p3.8">However, arguments against CSR do exist. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p3.8">Corporations, which are mainly owned by shareholders are said to be depriving them from their property rights<ref target="BAWE_0153e-ftnote.002"/> by being socially responsible. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p3.8">Personally, I think CSR is more of a complement to the shareholder approach because it will eventually increase a corporation's share value, provided its CSR is done appropriately. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p3.8">A corporation should attend to both its shareholders and stakeholders equally. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p3.8">No one approach is superior to the other, but this depends too on factors such as the current position of the corporation and its size. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p4.8">In my opinion, Cadbury Schweppes (CSc) addresses its CSR very systematically, and at the same time aims to create value to shareholders. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p4.8">This forms the basis of its business principles. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p4.8">Managed by a board of directors, it has non-executive directors whom are independent of management. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p4.8">CSR is one of the areas dealt by the board's sub-committees. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p4.8">CSc communicates its CSR through CSR Report which was first published in 2002. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p4.8">Building around 5 CSR pillars, it aims to produce the best long-term results for all its stakeholders<ref target="BAWE_0153e-ftnote.003"/>. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p5.8">On the community front, CSc has invested in many programmes around the world to contribute to the society. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p5.8">For example, CSc team spent a day in a school in Costa Rica, helped in realising its projects, donated to the school and assisted the children in learning the supply chain process<ref target="BAWE_0153e-ftnote.004"/>. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p5.8">This kind of activity made me think about the boundary of CSR. To what extent is CSR necessary to positively affect the company? </s>
<s n="s4.5;p5.8">Was the programme held out of sincerity and philanthropy or was it just a PR effort? </s>
<s n="s5.5;p5.8">Maybe the programme alone was not significant in increasing CSc's value, but a series of them would. </s>

<p n="p6.8">
<s n="s1.4;p6.8">On the environment aspect, CSc reported a drop in water consumption in its production process, in a factory in France, due to its efficient water management system. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p6.8">However, I reckon a success in one factory does not represent the overall success of being able to reduce water consumption. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p6.8">Furthermore, it triggered me, how far does the relevant stakeholder, in this case, the environmentalists, can affect other stakeholders, namely consumers, in upholding their course? </s>
<s n="s4.4;p6.8">Consumers who are not civic conscious will keep demanding the products. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.8">
<s n="s1.6;p7.8">CSc works in ensuring that its suppliers are treated justly. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p7.8">Thus, besides merely buying cocoa in Ghana, it helped the farmers by providing wells for drinking water. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p7.8">However, CSc was criticised for not knowing where the supply of its palm oil came from, which is thought to be in Malaysia. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p7.8">It is found that 60% of the plantation villages where it obtained its palm oil from did not have schools<ref target="BAWE_0153e-ftnote.005"/>. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p7.8">I think this goes to show that addressing CSR is not easy to the extent that every little thing matters and may not be worth considered. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p7.8">But I realised that this view is biased as I am not SCs' other stakeholders whom may take the matter seriously. </s>

<p n="p8.8">
<s n="s1.4;p8.8">In retrospect, I think implementing CSR can do more good than harm to corporations as long as its benefits outweigh its costs. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p8.8">However, it is difficult to set a boundary to CSR, to determine the type of issues that need to be addressed as some I think can be trivial. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p8.8">But to say that CSR is not important is too extreme a view, as both shareholders and stakeholders are key players in a corporation. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p8.8">Perhaps considering both, in moderation is the key to success. </s>
