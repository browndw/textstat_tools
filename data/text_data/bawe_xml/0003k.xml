<p n="p1.31">
<s n="s1.7;p1.31">When we talk about the 1930s in terms of social history, we often refer to the strong emergence of ideology into the public domain. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p1.31">Moreover, for Latin American countries, the first half of the twentieth century marked the coming of 'modernity'.<ref target="BAWE_0003k-ftnote.001"/> Other factors, however, such as immigration and a rumbling social hierarchy in the aftermath of slavery, tended to influence society in more informal ways. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p1.31">Self-representation through culture was usually closest at hand for the lower classes, and often provided a colourful means of communicating a multi-faceted message. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p1.31">In this essay we shall look at such cultural representations in Argentina, Brazil and Mexico, and assess the extent to which they contributed to the construction of a national identity. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p1.31">Naturally, art forms such as dance and music were, even though powerful, not the only way of expressing one's national sentiments. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p1.31">The first films with sound managed to reach a mass audience and demonstrated what it was like to be a true Argentine, or Brazilian, in a light package. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p1.31">Moreover, the aftermath of key political events (Argentina, the 'infamous decade' after the fall of Yrigoyen; Brazil, the 1930 coup of Vargas; Mexico, the heritage of the revolution) and the subsequent split among the people brought a new literature of thinkers focussing with urgency upon 'national character and the metaphysics of the Mexican, Argentinian or Brazilian 'being''.<ref target="BAWE_0003k-ftnote.002"/> The assessment of each country's culture climate thus provides interesting insights into the attempts made at a culturally constructed nationhood. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p2.31">The Argentina of the 1930s saw increasing modernisation and a changing political climate. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p2.31">This did not leave the notion of nationalism untouched; and, after the social positivism of the Irigoyen government that was overthrown in 1930, cultural representations of the Argentine nation became increasingly ambiguous. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p2.31">The 'Década Infame' brought a reconsideration of Argentine patriotism and the essence of 'Argentineness'. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p2.31">A new definition of the Argentine identity proved, however, not quite unproblematic. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p2.31">A nation of immigrants, Argentina had many faces and was, with the coming of further modernity and political maturing of the masses, thrust into a further set of cultural disparities. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p2.31">These were based upon dichotomies as varied as those of machismo versus feminism, the European-orientated metropolitan versus the patriotic gaucho, and that of the definition of a high culture versus that of commercially formed mass culture. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p2.31">Essentially, thus, the concept of <hi rend="italic">argentinidad</hi> was politically and culturally utilised in a multitude of ideological representations: 'The references to a collective ideal of the <hi rend="italic">argentinidad</hi> were continuous [...], although this ideal was defined in the most imprecise way and was basically the product of the whims and wishful thinking of the ideologues who wrote on the subject, more than an ideal that could be identified empirically as a trait of Argentina's culture'.<ref target="BAWE_0003k-ftnote.004"/> </s>

<s n="s2.2;p3.31">Sarmiento, Argentina's president between 1868 and 1874, regarded the countryside, inhabited by the mestizo gaucho Argentine, as uncivilized, chaotic - even barbarous: 'dirty children covered in rags, living amid packs of dogs; men stretched out on the ground, in utter inactivity; filth and poverty everywhere'.<ref target="BAWE_0003k-ftnote.005"/> The country's biggest cities, on the contrary, contained every aspect 'that characterizes cultured people'.<ref target="BAWE_0003k-ftnote.006"/> Later, the popular poem about <hi rend="italic">Martín Fierro</hi> created a distinction between the good, heroic and patriotic gaucho, and the barbarous and violent bad gaucho.<ref target="BAWE_0003k-ftnote.007"/> The early twentieth century thereafter saw a complete rehabilitation of the gaucho icon, when it was presented as an example of <hi rend="italic">argentinidad</hi> in an increasingly immigrant-dominated society.<ref target="BAWE_0003k-ftnote.008"/> This was, however, merely a constructed and idealised identity, and the by the end of the twenties, the plurality of immigrant cultures were gaining space from more traditional social and cultural dance clubs with names like 'The Patriotic Gauchos'.<ref target="BAWE_0003k-ftnote.009"/> In its stead came a new form of dance, less courteous and more fitting in the context of the big metropolis Buenos Aires: tango. </s>

<quote lang="English">'The only reason I don't carve you up is because you sicken me,' the Butcher said to Rosendo, threatening to strike him. That same moment, La Lujanera threw her arms around the Butcher's neck, fixing those eyes of hers on him, and said in a fury, 'Let him alone - making us think he was a man.' For a minute of so [the Butcher] was bewildered. Then, wrapping his arms around La Lujanera, he called to the musicians to play loud and strong, and he ordered the rest of us to dance. <ref target="BAWE_0003k-ftnote.011"/>

<s n="s5.9;p29.31">Borges refused to accept a simple, patriotic nationalism, thereby brilliantly revealing the paradoxes underlying such a concept; in Vargas' Brazil, the government was in a constant state of war with its poets and authors on the left, while former slaves of the <hi rend="italic">favelas</hi> proved to be able to provide Brazil's most uniting and lasting national identity. </s>

<s n="s7.9;p29.31">Their <hi rend="italic">corridos</hi> and murals invoked a revolutionary-ideological <hi rend="italic">Mexicanidad</hi>, party-style; and it would only be by the 1990s that Mexican natives started to wage war on that identity. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p30.31">Representations of national identity, then, are inherently linked with political ideology and power. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p30.31">Brazilian authors with tendencies toward communism provide the example; they employ a highly politicised image of the 'true Brazilian' proletariat. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p30.31">In Argentina, such representations resulted in two opposing views, the gauchoesque patriot, modelled after <hi rend="italic">Martin Fierro</hi> stood in contrast to the liberal modernist 'rational' Argentine inspired by Sarmiento's <hi rend="italic">Facundo</hi>. </s>

<s n="s5.7;p30.31">Similar in each of the three countries discussed, however, are the influences of 'lower' cultural forms. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p30.31">Tango, initially despised by all respectable layers of society, became the epitome of <hi rend="italic">Argentinidad</hi> and proud export product after its success in the Parisian salons, while the <hi rend="italic">samba</hi> of the Brazilian blacks became a national virtue. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p30.31">In Mexico, the <hi rend="italic">corrido</hi> and new popular film both served the ideal of praising the spiritual idealism that belonged inherently to the Mexican man and woman, as opposed to the violent pragmatism of Northern American men, and the dehumanised star beauty of the Hollywood actress. </s>

<p n="p31.31">
<s n="s1.5;p31.31">Nationalism in all countries discussed, became increasingly represented in popular ways, reaching out to a mass audience. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p31.31">The constructors of such nationalistic forms sought to reach out to an unprecedented number of people, instilling upon them these new forms of nationalism. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p31.31">In Brazil, <hi rend="italic">chanchadas</hi> united the country despite its immense differences in dialect, while in Mexico the party did their best to involve nationalism in every possible cultural and educational aspect. </s>

<s n="s5.5;p31.31">It can thus be said, that across these nations, the 1930s transformed nationalism into a popular and far-reaching construct. </s>
