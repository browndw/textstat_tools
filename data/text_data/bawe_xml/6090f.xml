<s n="s1.1;p4.33">Metalloporphyrins are important naturally occurring compounds, two such compounds are Chlorophyll, the green colouring photosynthetic pigment containing magnesium found in plants, and heme the red coloured pigment containing iron vital for the uptake and transport of oxygen around animals. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p6.33">To a 250mL round bottom flask 4 g's (4.0110g) of powdered manganese (II) acetate tetrahydrate, 9g's (9.255g) of phthalonitrile, 20mL of 1,2-propanediol and lastly 0.5g (0.5184g) of hydroquinone was added. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p6.33">A magnetic stirrer was placed inside and this was connected to a reflux condenser, this was then heated in an oil bath under reflux for 45 minutes. </s>

<s n="s4.4;p6.33">A part of this was put aside (enough to fill about a quarter of the Soxhlet thimble) with the rest being washed with five 25mL portions of hot ethanol; this was then dried in an oven at 100C. </s>

<p n="p9.33">
<s n="s1.5;p9.33">A Soxhlet apparatus was set up with the flask containing 150mL of n-butanol and 3 or 4 antibumping granules, and the thimble filled with the set aside crude black precipitated product. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p9.33">The apparatus should have been left at reflux at this point until the washings had no more brown coloration, but during the practical our product seemed to escape from the thimble and block up the glass tubing in the apparatus. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p9.33">This meant that the apparatus had to be disconnected so that the blockage could be removed but during this time our product must have become part of the impurities and as a consequence was washed away, and so after the apparatus had been reconnected and the supposed extraction was complete we had no pure product left in the thimble to continue the experiment with. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p9.33">The only explanation, which could be given for this, was that the thimble had a hole inside it, as this type of blockage is apparently a very rare coincidence under normal conditions. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p9.33">In order to complete the practical we used some of another groups successfully purified black product, which was dried thoroughly on filter paper and transferred to a watch glass which was placed inside an oven at 100 C in order to effectively dry the product. </s>

<s n="s3.6;p10.33">1mg of purified MnPc was added, this was then quickly stoppered so that a little pyridine is forced out and so meaning that no air is trapped inside the cell, the visible field region spectrum was then recorded. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p10.33">The stopper was then loosened and by use of a pipette a small amount of solution was removed causing an air bubble to be admitted, this was then re-stoppered and shaken when the spectrum was recorded again. </s>

<s n="s3.6;p11.33">Porphyrins that are more difficult to synthesis compared to phthalocyanines consist of the same structure as phthalocyanines but with the N bridging replaced by CH bridging, and they can be described as alkyl-substituted derivatives of porphin. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p12.33">When the manganese (II) phthalocyanine is first dissolved in pyridine with no Oxygen present, the first complex forms in which two pyridine ligands are attached to the original square planar [Mn(Pc)] complex. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p12.33">When Oxygen is introduced to the mixture in the second part of the procedure the second complex is firstly produced where one of the pyridine ligands is replaced by a hydroxyl (OH) ligand. </s>

<p n="p13.33">
<s n="s1.1;p13.33">When a pyridine solution containing the third complex is boiled, the solution is rapidly converted to one that again consists of the second complex, and when this is cooled this is then reconverted back into a solution containing the third complex. </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.33">
<s n="s1.1;p14.33">The second complex is green and has a characteristic absorption band at 716 nm and the last complex is blue and has a characteristic absorption band at 620 nm on a UV spectrum. </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.33">
<s n="s1.1;p15.33">By consideration of how pyridine reactions with the various variations of the [Mn (Pc)] complex, the UV spectra produced may be predicted to change in the following way, when Oxygen is introduced the absorption band in the 716nm range which is characteristic of the second complex should initially increase as the conc. of this complex has increased, but as time progresses this peak should decrease in height as this complex is being replaced by the third, meaning that the height of the absorption band at 620nm should increase as this represents the conc. of the third complex. </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.33">
<s n="s1.2;p16.33">But in reality the produced UV spectra did not possess this crossover point, where the conc. and so the height of the second complexes absorption band in the 716nm range is overtaken by the conc. and so height of the third complexes absorption band in the 620nm range of the spectra. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p16.33">As on this spectrum the conc. and so height of both of the absorption bands representing both of these species increases as time progresses. </s>
