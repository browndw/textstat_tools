<p n="p1.7">
<s n="s1.9;p1.7">I have now completed a year's work experience at Cowley Manor hotel, and feel I have developed as a person. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p1.7">Moving into the world of full time work after my first year at university was quite a shock. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p1.7">The first few weeks were busy with me settling into a new job and new town. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p1.7">I soon discovered that I enjoyed the set routine that comes with a full time job and knowing that time outside work was my own. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p1.7">I have always thought of myself as an independent person, but feel that my time in Cheltenham made me more independent. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p1.7">I looked after myself, and in work, I made a point of being eager to learn, and not be "spoon fed." </s>
<s n="s7.9;p1.7">I feel that I swiftly settled into work. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p1.7">This is reflected in my first appraisal, when Jake mentioned that I had adapted well to the areas I had worked in. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p1.7">When reflecting upon my first appraisal, I felt that my efforts to integrate myself and settle in had been recognised. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.7">
<s n="s1.9;p2.7">When I started work at Cowley Manor, I was expecting there to be high expectations of me. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p2.7">I thought it would be assumed that I would know exactly what I was doing, as I was a hospitality student. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p2.7">However, I was given plenty of guidance by Heads of Departments and other members of staff. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p2.7">I feel that this helped me to settle into my new surroundings. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p2.7">I was expecting the management to be more visible around the hotel than they were. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p2.7">When working in reception, I was witness to the times when they did very little. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p2.7">As the office was behind reception, it realised that often work was overlooked in favour for a football match on television. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p2.7">I saw how this lowered the morale of staff, particularly those on reception, and it made me consider the sort of manager that I would like to be in the future. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p2.7">I found it difficult to respect the managers when they were doing nothing. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.7">
<s n="s1.16;p3.7">By taking part in appraisals and writing a reflective journal over the course of the year at Cowley Manor, I have been able to identify the strengths in my working and my character. </s>
<s n="s2.16;p3.7">Over the first few months at the hotel, my organisation skills improved a lot. </s>
<s n="s3.16;p3.7">I feel that my organisation skills came to the fore in the restaurant in particular. </s>
<s n="s4.16;p3.7">I was entrusted with the responsibility of looking after a large group on the 24 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> September. </s>
<s n="s5.16;p3.7">As I had coped well that night, a few days later I was given the role of co-ordinating the smooth running of three small functions for the day (29 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> September). </s>
<s n="s6.16;p3.7">While in the restaurant, I feel that I was trusted to carry out my job properly, and was even asked to help train a new member of staff. </s>
<s n="s7.16;p3.7">I was also asked to carry out a supervisory role on two occasions (5 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 10 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> October). </s>
<s n="s8.16;p3.7">Being given this role made me very confident in my ability, and improved my self esteem. </s>
<s n="s9.16;p3.7">These experiences helped me to become very driven towards achieving similar responsibilities in other departments. </s>
<s n="s10.16;p3.7">Another strength that was identified in all of my appraisals was my ability to work under pressure. </s>
<s n="s11.16;p3.7">In March, the Gold Cup races are held in Cheltenham, and Cowley Manor was fully booked for the whole week. </s>
<s n="s12.16;p3.7">Working in reception at the time, I found that I never had a spare moment in the day, but enjoyed the constant work I was doing all the more. </s>
<s n="s13.16;p3.7">The moment that made me feel like I had really made an impression on management at the hotel was when the Reception Manager offered me a full time job after just six weeks of seeing me working in reception. </s>
<s n="s14.16;p3.7">Over the year, this was the person who really contributed to my improvements. </s>
<s n="s15.16;p3.7">She gave me praise when it was due, but also discussed my areas for improvement with me when necessary. </s>
<s n="s16.16;p3.7">As the other staff had so much confidence in my ability, I was able to develop more as a person. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.7">
<s n="s1.16;p4.7">Through my appraisals and journal, I was also able to identify weaknesses and areas for improvement. </s>
<s n="s2.16;p4.7">In my first appraisal, I was told that my social skills needed refining. </s>
<s n="s3.16;p4.7">This disappointed me as I felt my social skills were good. </s>
<s n="s4.16;p4.7">By my final appraisal, it was decided that this was the area where I had improved the most. </s>
<s n="s5.16;p4.7">As I am quite an opinionated person, often I would not fully listen to the opinions of others before giving my own, and this was commented on by another member of staff. </s>
<s n="s6.16;p4.7">I also had a tendency to intervene where it wasn't necessary with other members of staff who were arguing. </s>
<s n="s7.16;p4.7">In the spa, this happened when the manager had left for the rest of the day (18 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> Nov). </s>
<s n="s8.16;p4.7">I learnt that I should have stayed out of the situation, and spoken with the manager about it the following day. </s>
<s n="s9.16;p4.7">After this, there was only one further instance of confrontation with a restaurant supervisor (1 <hi rend="sup">st</hi> May). </s>
<s n="s10.16;p4.7">I should have handled this in a more grown up manner, and asked him to allow me to work in the way in which I was used to. </s>
<s n="s11.16;p4.7">Over the year, I did learn to consider other people's opinions more, and try to resolve disputes in a more rational manner. </s>
<s n="s12.16;p4.7">One area I found difficult was that sometimes too much was expected of me in terms of my ability. </s>
<s n="s13.16;p4.7">On one occasion (18 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> March), I think the other receptionist was niggled by my constant questioning, but he didn't recognise that I needed reassurance in what I was doing. </s>
<s n="s14.16;p4.7">As I was generally confident in what I was doing, it was sometimes forgotten that I had only worked in each department for a short time. </s>
<s n="s15.16;p4.7">A weakness that my mentor highlighted was that I struggled to accept and act on criticism. </s>
<s n="s16.16;p4.7">From this point, I made an effort to take on board the comments of others, and spent more time thinking about what I was doing, and how it could be improved. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.7">
<s n="s1.6;p5.7">Having completed my placement, I aim to build on my strengths, and improve my weaknesses. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p5.7">At university and in future jobs, I will continue to tackle challenges with confidence and good organisation. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p5.7">I will also take pride in my work to maintain its quality. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p5.7">I will continue to refine my social skills by involving myself with different people in different situations. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p5.7">I need to reflect more on my performances and act on criticism to show acceptance. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p5.7">I also need to be more aware of other people's opinions, allowing myself to form a more considered opinion. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.7">
<s n="s1.6;p6.7">Before starting my work placement, I completed a learning styles questionnaire, related to the learning cycle adapted by Honey and Mumford (1992). </s>
<s n="s2.6;p6.7">I discovered that my preferred learning style was to take a pragmatic approach. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p6.7">I recently completed the questionnaire again, and discovered that although I am still a pragmatic learner, I am also more inclined to theoretical learning than I once was (Appendix 10). </s>
<s n="s4.6;p6.7">I feel that this is fairly accurate as I tend to find out how something should happen in theory, and then go on to find out what happens in practice. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p6.7">I need to become more of an active learner to become more balanced. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p6.7">In order to do this, I need to try to be more open to new ideas and be more spontaneous to try new things. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.7">
<s n="s1.9;p7.7">I have thoroughly enjoyed working for a year at Cowley Manor. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p7.7">The experience has opened my eyes to full time work, and the commitment it requires. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p7.7">Over the year, I have developed practical skills directly related to the roles I carried out, as well as personal skills that I will be able to transfer to future jobs and situations. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p7.7">The experience made me reflect more on the person I was, the way I worked, and my performance within work. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p7.7">I have used these reflections to change where necessary. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p7.7">I think my biggest area of development was my social skills. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p7.7">Although I initially felt they were good, reflection showed me where improvements were needed. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p7.7">I also feel that the experience has made me a more confident person on the outside and in my own ability. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p7.7">The work placement year has only been a positive experience for me. </s>
