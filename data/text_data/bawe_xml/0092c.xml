<s n="s3.5;p67.67">Moreover, by dividing my sample in high and low manufacturing exporters, one can see that their respective correlation coefficients of exports and GDP growth differ to a large extent. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p67.67">After regressing the share of manufactured exports on wage expenditure, electricity production, exports and foreign direct investment, I come to the conclusion that governments should pursue an outward oriented policy that channels investment into the manufacturing sector. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p67.67">Governments are furthermore well advised to privatize energy markets and keep wage expenditure at a low level to fully benefit from the effect manufacturing exports have on Output. </s>
