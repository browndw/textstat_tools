<p n="p2.29">
<s n="s1.2;p2.29">Formation of conservation targeted government body was motivated by the increasing public recognition on the importance of countryside for recreation in the 1940s, resulting in the establishment of Nature Conservancy by National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p2.29">By the Nature Conservancy Council Act 1973, Nature Conservancy was replaced with Nature Conservancy Council with four main aims of (EN 1992); </s>

<p n="p3.29">
<s n="s1.3;p3.29">Further reformation was taken place in 1992 by Environmental Protection Act 1990 which appointed English Nature, the Countryside Council for Wales, Scottish Natural Heritage to work on regional level and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee as a coordinating body on national and international issues. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p3.29">English Nature, an agency for England, was launched on 9 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> April 1991 with an aim to promote conservation of England's wildlife and natural features for future generations (EN 1992). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p3.29">As a result of integration with the Countryside Agency and the Rural Development Service in October 2006, newly established Natural England will extend its power over various aspects of countryside conservation including the designation of SSSIs, National Parks, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) and implementation of regulations on management of those sites, particularly in order to improve the public access and to promote rural development, as well as provision of grants, advice and information to the government and non-governmental bodies (EN 2006①). </s>
