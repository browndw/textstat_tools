<s n="s1.2;p1.28">Following his inauguration as President of the United States, on 4 March 1933, Franklin D. Roosevelt commenced with putting his New Deal policy into effect. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p1.28">This unique programme of legislation was formulated in response to the Great Depression, during which the nation had plummeted into a situation of inconceivable destitution and despair, as a catastrophic repercussion of the Wall Street Crash on 29 October 1929. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.28">
<s n="s1.2;p2.28">The evaluation of the New Deal, in retrospect, raises questions not only of its short-term success, regarding whether it achieved its ultimate objective of lifting the country out of depression, but also of its long-term impact on the United States. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p2.28">This evaluation is synonymous with the debate on whether the New Deal was 'revolutionary or evolutionary'<ref target="BAWE_0129b-ftnote.001"/>, echoing historical notions of continuity and change, in which American historians and political scientists, notably Chalmers Johnson<ref target="BAWE_0129b-ftnote.002"/>, have played down its revolutionary characteristics. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p3.28">It is essential to consider the provenance of studies on the success of the New Deal, specifically including the personal background of historians. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p3.28">For instance, historians who endured the Great Depression, and thus directly experienced the effects of the New Deal, may be 'tinged with a pinch of compassion'<ref target="BAWE_0129b-ftnote.003"/> when surmising its level of success, however, 'as time passes, historians feel a little less personally involved with the New Deal and less defensive about it'<ref target="BAWE_0129b-ftnote.004"/> and thus may be readily critical of its achievements. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p4.28">Interpretations of the New Deal, and its success, diverge between right and left wing classifications, the latter continuing to dominate its historiography. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p4.28">Left wing historians, such as Barton Bernstein<ref target="BAWE_0129b-ftnote.005"/> and Paul Conkin<ref target="BAWE_0129b-ftnote.006"/>, believe the New Deal was unable to wholly depart from liberal reformist ideals and therefore incapable of completely reviving the collapsed economy. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p4.28">More positively, centre-left historians, for example William Leuchtenburg<ref target="BAWE_0129b-ftnote.007"/>, observe the New Deal as being a fundamental reform and enduring success of the political system. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p4.28">At the other end of the historiographical spectrum, those from the right wing school, including Robert Higgs<ref target="BAWE_0129b-ftnote.008"/>, attack the New Deal as being an ultimate betrayal of traditional liberal values of laissez-faire, thus allowing elements of Communism to burgeon in the United States. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p4.28">Within this range of interpretations there is not an absolute denial that the New Deal was successful to a certain extent in its preliminary achievements, however there exist discrepancies concerning the degree of its long-term impact. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p5.28">The Great Depression signified an unforeseen departure from the earlier prosperity of the decade and left the United States in a state of emergency. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p5.28">The explicit purpose of the New Deal was as a response to this situation, thus its success should be measured according to the extent to which it brought the country out of depression and stimulated the economy, by presenting an overview of its chief policies. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.28">
<s n="s1.1;p6.28">The epoch of the New Deal is divided into two distinctive phases, the First and Second, in accordance with the objective of its policies; namely relief, recovery and reform. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.28">
<s n="s1.2;p7.28">The First New Deal, spanning the period 1933 to 1935, specifically focused upon relief and recovery: 'the tremendous emergency of the depression had produced an insistence that government undertake the tasks of unemployment relief and economic recovery." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0129b-ftnote.009"/>
<s n="s2.2;p7.28">In the whirlwind of the first 'Hundred Days' Roosevelt created a plethora of 'Alphabet Agencies'<ref target="BAWE_0129b-ftnote.010"/>, employing the fiscal tool of deficit spending. </s>

<p n="p8.28">
<s n="s1.2;p8.28">Early relief campaigns to provide shelter and food were combined with policies of recovery, commencing with the Emergency Banking Act (Glass-Steagall Act) in March 1933. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p8.28">This succeeded in restoring the nation's confidence in the financial system by proving the solvency of banks and ensuring the security of money deposited in them, persuading people to utilise them again. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.28">
<s n="s1.3;p9.28">The National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) became law, in 1933, with the intention of remedying the dire situation of unemployment and industrial disorganisation, and has been labelled 'the governments most elaborate scheme to revive industry." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0129b-ftnote.011"/>
<s n="s2.3;p9.28">Its success depended on the supplementary agencies that it established for designated purposes: the Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA), the Public Works Administration (PWA) and the National Recovery Administration (NRA). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p9.28">These were key components of the New Deal and 'welding these different elements together was a triumph'<ref target="BAWE_0129b-ftnote.012"/>, implying their combined involvement in its success. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p10.28">The New Deals agricultural programme, commanded by the AAA, benefited farmers by <hi rend="italic">limiting</hi> production within the <hi rend="italic">existing</hi> system, which marginally increased their income. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p10.28">However, its success is lessened because it diminished farmers' entrepreneurial independence, and it did not have an immense effect on the economy as a whole. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p10.28">The Resettlement Administration, of 1935, subsequently proposed <hi rend="italic">increasing</hi> production under a <hi rend="italic">reformed</hi> system, representing one of the ironies with which the New Deal was riddled, and exacerbated the constraints of the New Deals success in agriculture. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.28">
<s n="s1.4;p11.28">The PWA was the most successful division of the NIRA, formed to pump state funds into construction works schemes, of which there existed over thirty thousand, in the hope of stimulating industry. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p11.28">The PWA was somewhat successful in its attempts to bring the country out of depression, by creating an influx of work for millions of starving people, although it did not equal pre-depression levels of employment. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p11.28">The majority of PWA projects led to the erection of structures that stood as marked successes of the New Deal, for example 'bridges...schools, and hospitals'<ref target="BAWE_0129b-ftnote.013"/>, leaving the State with something to show for its vast expenditure. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p12.28">Although initially considered the keystone of Roosevelt's New Deal programme, the NRA 'became an object of great controversy after the initial flush of enthusiasm'<ref target="BAWE_0129b-ftnote.014"/>, and was declared unconstitutional in May 1935 following the Supreme Court ruling in Schechter Poultry Corporation v. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p12.28">United States. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p12.28">The success of the NRA dwindled as a result of its over-zealous attempts to regulate all areas of business, as opposed to concentrating its efforts on major industry. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p12.28">Hence, it did not succeed in its efforts to stimulate demand and arguably brought the United States closer to socialism, by allowing Presidential intervention in commerce. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p12.28">Nevertheless, the social reforms promoted by the NRA, for fixed minimum wages and shorter working hours, must not be undervalued. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p13.28">Another successful aspect of the New Deal was the 'most admired'<ref target="BAWE_0129b-ftnote.015"/> Civilian Conservation Corps, formed in March 1933, which targeted the demoralised youth. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p13.28">The prime focus was upon young male victims of the depression, of whom the CCC had employed 250,000<ref target="BAWE_0129b-ftnote.016"/> in their camps by August 1933. </s>
