<s n="s1.2;p1.11">The presentation was given by Group C and outlined advantages and disadvantages available to Chinese firms and their effect on western multi-nationals. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p1.11">The model used to illustrate this business dynamic was 'Porter's Diamond of National Advantage' shown below. </s>

<quote lang="English">"Michael E. Porter argued that a nation can create new advanced factor endowments such as skilled labour, a strong technology and knowledge base, government support, and culture. Porter used a diamond shaped diagram as the basis of a framework to illustrate the determinants of national advantage."<ref target="BAWE_0193b-ftnote.001"/>

</note>
<p n="p2.11">
<s n="s1.1;p2.11">The four corners of the diamond are aspects that can lead to a national competitive advantage and can be explained as follows: </s>
</p>
<p rend="ordered" n="p3.11">
<s n="s1.2;p3.11">Factor conditions - A country creates its own factors such as skills and technology. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p3.11">Lack of these factors forces innovation ultimately leading to a national competitive advantage. </s>
</p>
<p rend="ordered" n="p4.11">
<s n="s1.2;p4.11">Demand Conditions - A stronger and more demanding local market helps local firms anticipate global trends. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p4.11">When local demand is greater than in foreign markets, local firms devote more attention to it leading to an advantage when exporting that product. </s>
</p>
<p rend="ordered" n="p5.11">
<s n="s1.1;p5.11">Related and Supporting industries - When supporting industries are competitive more cost effective and innovative inputs are available </s>
</p>
<p rend="ordered" n="p6.11">
<s n="s1.2;p6.11">Firm Strategy, Structure, and Rivalry - Strategy and structure helps determine in which industry a country may excel. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p6.11">Low rivalry can make a firm attractive, however increased rivalry can lead to improvement and innovation to provide an advantage. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.11">
<s n="s1.4;p7.11">Traditional theories implied there were five factors that gave a region a 'comparative advantage'; Land, Location, Natural Resources, Labour and Population Size. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p7.11">These 'Factor Endowments' are difficult to influence and as a result, Porter believes they are inadequate. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p7.11">He argued that sustained growth has rarely been built on these inherent factors and that they may even impede a nation's drive to innovate. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p7.11">The diamond model is best used as a tool to help understand a nation's competitive position in global competition. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.11">
<s n="s1.5;p8.11">The presentation focused on sources of advantages and disadvantages to China but also developed explainations of how these may threaten western firms. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p8.11">To this effect the Diamond Model is useful and well used by the group. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p8.11">However, both the model itself and the group failed to give any indication as to the impact of Foreign Direct Investment on the region in question. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p8.11">Benefits of internationalisation of production seem to be over looked and it seems to be assumed that only outward FDI is useful in creating a competitive advantage. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p8.11">In short, the model seems to place too much emphasis on domestic determinants. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.11">
<s n="s1.2;p9.11">The concepts raised in the presentation helped provide me with an insight not just in how a given nation can seek to innovate but also how, as a rival nation, threats and opportunities can be identified. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p9.11">Taking into account the question answered in the presentation it seems that Porter's model ties in particularly well with the SWOT analysis tool to assess a region's credentials. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.11">
<s n="s1.5;p10.11">Despite being heavily used in teaching, a number of Porter's models have been heavily criticised in recent years. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p10.11">Questions have been raised as to its applicability, as it was derived from case studies into 10 major industrialised economies. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p10.11">This means its application is best suited to developed economies. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p10.11">Porter's Diamond also seems to over emphasise micro-factors and tends to disregard factors such as exchange or interest rates. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p10.11">Given his acknowledgement of the role of the government, it seems to me that these semi-controllable influences are of a significant importance. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.11">
<s n="s1.3;p11.11">This reflection has helped me clarify the models highlighted in the 'Internationalisation &amp; China' lecture of Term 2. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p11.11">I now realise that the models applied during the seminar presentations are best understood when used in conjunction with a prior understanding of their context. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p11.11">I will therefore seek to research the concepts employed before the next seminar so that the subjects explored are more easily recognisable. </s>
