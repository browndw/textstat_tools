<head rend="bold italic">Important Assumption</head>
<p>The following are significant assumptions made in the OPSI assignment:</p>
<p>The traditional manufacturer, named sun, locates on Birmingham, which is nearby to its major customers, Toyota, Jaguar, Peugeot and Citroen. It is specialist in automotive exhaust system with a throughput of 800,000 annually. Traditional functional layout has been adopted in manufacturing process. IT system do not implement in manufacture department, although it has been used in financial department. Long setups and logistics lead to long production runs. Workers in machine shop usually have to pull products from finished goods and rebuild them for custom order as a result of poor quality management.</p>

</head>
<p n="p1.105">
<s n="s1.2;p1.105">In question sheet, the manufacturer planed to convert process layout to more suitable and advanced cell layout. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p1.105">I, as a new managing director, has been asked to formulate a manufacturing strategy for the new body shop of lean manufacture, based on Hayes and Wheelwright's elements [1], released in their well-known book "Restoring Our Competitive Edge: Competing Through Manufacturing", where they argue that the process of formulating a manufacturing strategy should involve in company's structure and infrastructure, divided in ten decision areas. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.105">
<s n="s1.2;p2.105">Manufacturing strategy is dynamic, in different times firms have different strategy. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p2.105">A manufacturing strategy, on the one hand, should support corporate strategy which determines what businesses the division should operate, and on the other hand, should interact with other functional strategies such as marketing strategy and financial strategy etc. </s>
</p>
<div2>
<head rend="bold italic">1.1 Business Environment</head>
<p n="p3.105">
<s n="s1.4;p3.105">Before the start of formulating manufacturing strategy, a clear understanding and assessment of market is necessary to help us to get competitive advantages through manufacturing. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p3.105">John Puttick's market segmentation grid is the tool that is often utilized to define market position of product and show the link between the market and order winning criteria. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p3.105">The distinction between order qualifying and order-winning criteria is important. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p3.105">The order qualifying is a basic requirement which must be satisfied, and the order winning is your competitive advantage compared your competitors. </s>
</p>
<figure id="BAWE_0168b-fig.001">
<head>Figure 1-1 John Puttick's grid showing market segmentation and business process and competencies</head>
</figure>
<p n="p4.105">
<s n="s1.2;p4.105">As what is indicated in the figure 1-1, for exhaust system product that is launched in a well-developed market, high complexity and low uncertainty are significant factors. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p4.105">The grid also implies that, in the third quadrant, delivery lead time and flexibility would be the order winning which could provide a competitive edge to gain sales in market place, rather than product quality and reliability which just are basic factors required to maintain a market share. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.105">
<s n="s1.7;p5.105">From market perspective, a noticeable trend has been seen that global car market is increasing gradually, especially in certain Asia areas including China, Indian, and South Korea, the growth is obvious. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p5.105">From the figure 1-2 [2], we can see that the sales in Asia increased from 4479 million units in 1998 to 7769 million in 2003, raised by 73%. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p5.105">With the development of technology and maturation of production system, many automakers start to increase variety of car models and reduce product life cycle for each model of car, actually Toyota has reduced its product life cycle to three years. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p5.105">Meanwhile, large automobile company have changed in their behaviour and structure such that they subcontract more to SME's. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p5.105">Because a greater reliance on SME's, they seek to integrate suppliers into their supply chain system through a series of certificate constituted by themselves. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p5.105">All above are signals that there are huge development room for automotive component industry with high flexibility and short lead times required. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p5.105">This is a great chance for Sun Company to recover </s>

<head rend="bold italic">1.2 Structure Decision Area</head>
<p n="p7.105">
<s n="s1.3;p7.105">Structure decision areas contain four categories Capacity, Facility, Technology and Vertical Integration. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p7.105">The decisions in each of category will have a long-term impact, and need a large sum of capital to expand capacity, rearrange plant layout, employ new n/c machines and robots for example, which maybe lead to financial problems if the decisions made in wrong way. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p7.105">We will analyze the four categories respectively. </s>
</p>
<div3>
<head rend="italic">1.2.1 Capacity</head>
<p n="p8.105">
<s n="s1.2;p8.105">Capacity strategy is a major element of a company's manufacturing strategy, which consists of a set of time-sequence capacity decisions based on long-time market, economy environment, technology and behaviours of competitors. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p8.105">The most important decisions are the amount and timing of capacity changes in relation to demand changes at strategy purposes. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.105">
<s n="s1.3;p9.105">There are various ways to change the capacity. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p9.105">For example, overtime work and shift are convenience ways to increase or reduce capacity in a certain period; rebuilding machine shop layout to lean manufacture. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p9.105">Increasing new equipment and new plant also are commonly ways to expand capacity to meet customer demands in a long-term perspective. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.105">
<s n="s1.4;p10.105">As Hay's statement [1], there are three generic type of capacity cushion when demand is expected to grow steadily. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p10.105">Firstly, capacity leads demand type, it indicates that capacity should exceed demand and keep in a reasonable range in order to avoid the likelihood of running short. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p10.105">The second type of capacity cushion is capacity in approximate equilibrium with demand, which suggests that company should attempt to match the capacity and demand as accurate as possible, although forecasting is difficult in reality. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p10.105">The capacity lags demand is the third capacity cushion which can achieve maximum capacity utilization. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.105">
<s n="s1.2;p11.105">Determining how much capacity we need to meet market demand is another problem. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p11.105">Tradeoffs between the economies of scale and diseconomies of scale should be done to get the optimal economic scale. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.105">
<s n="s1.1;p12.105">Although Sun Company has been steadily losing business and unused capacity generally is expensive, I still recommend expanding production capacity by using the first capacity cushion as the result of motor industry's boom and economy cycle. </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.105">
<s n="s1.4;p13.105">According to the analysis of industrial environment, the growth of market opportunities driven by Asian and African car consumption market has boosted many auto companies blooming again which imply that there would be a rapidly increasing needs for capacity of exhaust system to meet customers satisfaction. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p13.105">In a growing market, extra capacity is a strong and aggressive weapon to attract new customers who don't get what they want from our competitors with capacity constrained. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p13.105">Actually, if a firm runs with the type of capacity lags demand, it seems as if maximum utilization of machines can be achieved and therefore provides a higher average rate of return on manufacturing investment than that would be possible with a lower utilization rate. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p13.105">However, company has to reject some order because of capacity-constraint; it means customers lost which is disadvantaged for further development. </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.105">
<s n="s1.2;p14.105">Nowadays, the rate of interest is definitely low, although global economy has broken away from recession gradually and starts to recover. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p14.105">Investment at the bottom of economy will form large competitive advantage and put company into indefectible position. </s>

<head rend="italic">1.2.2 Facility</head>
<p n="p15.105">
<s n="s1.5;p15.105">The term of facility involves in number, size, location, specialization of plants, and organisation of individual plant. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p15.105">In a multinational corporate, how many different facilities should be utilized, how big should each be, where they should be located, and how should each be specialized, these questions are key structural decisions confronted by leadership. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p15.105">An optimal network of plants can provide core competitive edge to beat competitors. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p15.105">However, in this case, the Sun Company only has one plant with 200 employees in the machine shop. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p15.105">So, we focus on the choices of layout and process. </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.105">
<s n="s1.1;p16.105">There are four basic layout types as follow: </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p17.105">
<s n="s1.1;p17.105">Fixed position. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p18.105">
<s n="s1.1;p18.105">It is common to use this layout when the product is heavy or fragile and in this approach operators and raw materials come to the product itself. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p19.105">
<s n="s1.1;p19.105">Process layout. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p20.105">
<s n="s1.1;p20.105">In this layout, machines with similar functions are gathered in certain area to make a wide range of products. </s>

<s n="s1.1;p21.105">Cell layout. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p22.105">
<s n="s1.1;p22.105">With this approach, areas of the plant are dedicated to particular product types in a cell of manufacture, machines are grouped together for a particular family of products. </s>

<p rend="bulleted" n="p24.105">
<s n="s1.1;p24.105">Machines are dedicated to a small range of products and every stage is different from next. </s>
</p>
<p n="p25.105">
<s n="s1.3;p25.105">Layout is just layout itself if there is no link with process. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p25.105">According to hill [3], there are five classic processes that a firm has to choose one or more: project, jobbing, batch, line and continuous process. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p25.105">The choice of process is the one best able to match the market requirement in which the company is competing. </s>
</p>
<p n="p26.105">
<s n="s1.7;p26.105">Considering the assumption in the preceding, this company provides a large range of exhaust system for motorcar and motorbike companies. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p26.105">Small order quantities, high frequency delivery, high level of product's variety are three significant characteristics of order from motor company in where lean manufacture usually is implemented. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p26.105">The company's machine shop is functional layout now. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p26.105">In order to meet the customer requirement that small volume, flexibility and quick delivery, batch process associated with cell layout should be selected in the main process. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p26.105">It could be better to choose line process for the final assembly and packaging, because of the standard nature of these activities. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p26.105">Cellular organization is the heart of lean manufacture, and with the introduction of philosophy of lean manufacture, we can reduce manufacturing lead time, improve product cost, quality and delivery and create an atmosphere of employee involvement and continuous improvement. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p26.105">Indeed, in Japan, layout and investment in facilities has been made for flexibility and the ability to quickly shift to different product models or to different outputs of production, that is why Japanese companies can beat west in 90s. </s>

<s n="s3.3;p29.105">In order to provide strong support to the cell manufacture we chose above, where a group of machines forms a cell in order to build a small range of products, Group Technology is best choice to fit the change from job shop layout where the company stay in, to cell layout where we wish to go. </s>
