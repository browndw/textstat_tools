<s n="s3.3;p1.12">A beginning point to this rise in status might be 2002 when Phillip Pullman won the Whitbread Book of the Year Award for <hi rend="italic">The Amber Spyglass</hi>. </s>

<s n="s1.1;p4.12">However, another popular genre within the children's publishing market is that of 'real-life' teenage fiction where authors such as Jacqueline Wilson and Anne Fine have also received much 'frontline' marketing attention. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.12">
<s n="s1.5;p5.12">I have chosen Random House Children's Books as my prospective publisher. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p5.12">Their collaboration with Transworld Children's Books has increased their prestige in recent years. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p5.12">More importantly for me is the genres of fiction that are dominant in their books. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p5.12">Other publishers, particularly Bloomsbury, have recently become focused on fantasy and thus my book would not fit well into their list. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p5.12">Random House's work with authors like Jacqueline Wilson and Anne Fine has brought the real-life genre of teenage children's fiction into a prominent light and thus I feel that this publisher's experience will benefit the marketing of my book. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.12">
<s n="s1.5;p6.12">My book fits into this segment of the market and is targeted primarily at young teenage girls aged twelve years and above. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p6.12">It is written from the viewpoint of a teenager which "allows them to identify with the text and to <hi rend="italic">believe</hi> in what they are reading." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3006i-ftnote.005"/>
<s n="s3.5;p6.12">This is what sets it in line with books by the fore mentioned authors. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p6.12">Moreover, my proposed novel, <hi rend="italic">Centre Stage</hi> brings into play other issues that are commonly found in teenage anxieties such as divorce and various pressures from school. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p6.12">The way in which the protagonist overcomes her problems will be attractive to both parents and young teenagers themselves. </s>

<p n="p7.12">
<s n="s1.3;p7.12">I have considered primarily 'pull' promotional strategies as the basis of the publicising of my book. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p7.12">There are several reasons for this. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p7.12">The first is that the publishing industry could be described as a "Perfectly Competitive Market", which has little consumer loyalty. <ref target="BAWE_3006i-ftnote.006"/>Thus, for a new author it might be more effective to communicate to the readers, or buyers, more directly, since very few look at who is actually publishing the book. </s>

</note>
<p n="p8.12">
<s n="s1.3;p8.12">In Eccleshare's report, 2002, she states that "Authors....now promote themselves...through school and library visits". </s>
<s n="s2.3;p8.12">As a new author, this might be effective and will cost publishers very little. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p8.12">It appeals to both the young teenage reader and parents; the children will partake in any workshops and be exposed to the book whilst parents will sign consent forms and learn about author and novel through the child. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.12">
<s n="s1.6;p9.12">It is important in marketing to identify the right media. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p9.12">The dominant theme of drama in my novel is particularly significant to me, the author, and could possibly lead to effective marketing campaigns. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p9.12">Initially, a local campaign would perhaps be effective as I am a teacher in the area and a well known actress within the local theatre circle. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p9.12">I have also written theatre reviews for the BBC Three Counties Radio Website and the local newspaper both of which might be willing to make the release of my book a major feature. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p9.12">On the BBC website in particular there is a specific section for teenagers which would be an effective place to print, on line, an interview or press release. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p9.12">In turn a more national campaign might develop including nationwide library and school visits. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.12">
<s n="s1.3;p10.12">It might also be possible to expand this local appeal to one which might attract wider, national attention. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p10.12">My own stage experience began at home at the age of seven, when I performed in <hi rend="italic">The Luton Children's Variety Show</hi> with Faye Tozer, before she became internationally recognised for her singing career with the pop band 'Steps'. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p10.12">A campaign for the book using this connection could be very effective. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.12">
<s n="s1.5;p11.12">Although there are many alternative mediums of advertising media, as a new author, it might be more realistic and, indeed, more effective to concentrate on more publicity based promotions. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p11.12">It is possible to assert that as opposed to advertising "Publicity has far greater impact in that it appears to come from a third person and is thus more believable." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3006i-ftnote.007"/>
<s n="s3.5;p11.12">However, one other form of publicity might be through young teenage magazines, for example <hi rend="italic">Shout</hi>. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p11.12">The novel deals with issues that are common among teenagers of this age and thus readers of such magazines might be interested in buying my book. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p11.12">Furthermore, Television programmes such as <hi rend="italic">Blue Peter</hi> and channels, for example 'Nickelodeon', which are aimed at my target audience, might also be possibilities, paticularly since I am a young writer. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p12.12">In terms of packaging I would like my book to have a brightly coloured jacket. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p12.12">Although I like the illustrations for Jacqueline Wilson's books by Nick Sharratt, I think it is important that there is a significant difference in those for the sleeve of my book. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p12.12">Having researched many illustrators, I am drawn to the work of Steve Cox who works in a variety of styles and media<ref target="BAWE_3006i-ftnote.008"/>. </s>
