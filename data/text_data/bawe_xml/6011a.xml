<titlePart>Discussion of the Winogradsky column results:</titlePart>
</docTitle>
<docTitle>
<titlePart>Winogradsky columns are completely self contained systems of microbial life that recycle the available nutrients and run only on light energy. They start off with low numbers of organisms which gradually increase as the column develops. The cellulose provided by the strips of paper and the oxygen availability promotes rapid growth initially. This then depletes the oxygen availability in the sediment around the paper and eventually creates distinct zones throughout the column due to the availability of nutrients such as oxygen and sulphur. </titlePart>

<p n="p10.10">
<s n="s1.2;p10.10">From looking at our Winogradsky columns the different zones can be identified by their levels and their colours, our experiment shows that the three columns with only distilled water added have signs of ferric hydroxide encrusted sheathed bacteria at the top, some initial growth of purple non-sulphur bacteria on the inside of the glass and the dark coloured sediment suggests H <hi rend="sub">2</hi>S production in the presence of iron. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p10.10">The addition of extra sodium sulphate and salt affects the rate and the growth in the other columns but it is hard to quantify as the columns need to be left for longer to mature sufficiently for the system to have balanced. </s>
