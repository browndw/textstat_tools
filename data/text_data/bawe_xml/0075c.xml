<s n="s1.3;p1.25">This essay will first outline the main assumptions and tenets of the liberalist, neo-liberalist, realist, neo-realist, and the different Marxist approaches to the study of international relations. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p1.25">Having done this groundwork it is hoped that a personal conclusion will be reached about whether there is a theory that competently deals with international relations and its many constituent parts. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p1.25">The exclusion from the analysis of international society theory amongst other constructivist and reflectivist approaches does not reflect disregard for the considerable achievements this approach has made, merely an acceptance that there is only so much one can cover in two thousand words. </s>

<p n="p2.25">
<s n="s1.2;p2.25">Liberalism's central concern is the liberty of the individual. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p2.25">It posits that the main determinants of world peace are: open state governments which are responsive to the needs of its individual citizens; inter-state governments which could help safeguard the rights of these individuals; international cooperation which would foster a sentiment of trust across all national boundaries; and finally free trade which would further entrench the notion of a shared purpose between countries.<ref target="BAWE_0075c-ftnote.001"/> </s>

<s n="s2.2;p3.25">Liberal idealists stress the need to construct an international order where freedom for the individual is enhanced and the freedom of the state actors scrutinised. <ref target="BAWE_0075c-ftnote.002"/> </s>

<s n="s1.2;p5.25">Neo-liberal internationalists focus much upon the relationship between democratic state actors with other democratic state actors and democratic state actors and authoritarian regimes. </s>

<s n="s2.2;p8.25">To expand on this, one could argue that Realism has three main characteristics: statism, survival, and self-help, as outlined in the paragraph below. </s>

<s n="s2.4;p9.25">It places importance on survival in that the one and only duty of the state is to ensure the sustenance of the moral community that resides within it. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p9.25">Whilst 'sustenance' for defensive realists means the attainment of security as a means of securing its survival, for offensive realists it translates as territorial and concomitant expansion.<ref target="BAWE_0075c-ftnote.006"/> Finally the theory is based around self-help because world politics is to them a zero-sum game, each of the major states vie for pre-eminence resulting in their interests being mutually exclusive and co-operation pointless. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p10.25">Neo-realism shares the basic assumptions of its forbear, but it has nonetheless made the approach more theoretically rigorous. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p10.25">Thanks to the work of Kenneth Waltz structural realism has rose to the fore in international relations theory, and remains to be perhaps the dominant theoretical approach within neo-realism. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p10.25">Structural realism has three distinct characteristics. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p10.25">Firstly whilst classical realism explains state's action within the anarchical international system in terms of unit or bottom-up analysis (i.e. by looking at the salient issues and individual positions of the states concerned), structural realism contends that it is the system of anarchy and the 'distribution of capabilities across units' above anything else which determines a states' political actions. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p10.25">Secondly whilst the former generally sees power in terms of military prowess, the latter sees it more on a general level- as a means of effecting change on the international scene. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p10.25">Lastly while the former sees the anarchical nature of world politics as a factor that effects states simply 'in accordance with their size, location, domestic politics, and leadership qualities', the latter argues that anarchy defines the system, that as all states are 'functionally similar units' as they are all presented with the same constraints, so the differences in action must be due to the differences in power and capabilities.<ref target="BAWE_0075c-ftnote.008"/> </s>

<s n="s2.2;p11.25">The former stresses the importance of absolute power, the incompatibility of states' goals and the inevitability of conflict; the latter highlights the economic burden of military mobilisation and the possibility of cooperation. <ref target="BAWE_0075c-ftnote.009"/> </s>

<s n="s1.2;p12.25">The central tenet of world-system theory championed by the Marxist Wallerstein is that the two dominant systems in international history- world empires and world-economies, transfer resources from the peripheral, underdeveloped countries to the core, developed countries, the former by means of the market, and the latter by means of centralised control over resource distribution. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p12.25">The market's inherent instability, in terms of its cyclical booms and busts combined with its many internal contradictions coupled with its ability for resources to drift from the hands of the poor to the rich (as outlined above) renders the system that presently prevails, doomed for downfall.<ref target="BAWE_0075c-ftnote.010"/> </s>

<s n="s3.4;p15.25">It started badly when in its nascence the US congress blocked America from joining partly because many feared the country's interests would be subordinate to an international institution (an example of state egoism if ever there was one). </s>
