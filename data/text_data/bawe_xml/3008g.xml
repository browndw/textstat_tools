<s n="s1.3;p1.16">Externally, it would appear that there are very few parallels between Louise Bennett's poem <hi rend="underlined">Home Sickness</hi> and Robyn Bolam's <hi rend="underlined">Gruoch</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p1.16">One is a wistful and nostalgic reflection about Jamaican life whilst the other is a dark attempt to re-write Lady Macbeth's tumultuous history. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p1.16">The nature of identity and the individuality of one's voice are prominent themes in both poems. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.16">
<s n="s1.4;p2.16">
<hi rend="underlined">Home Sickness</hi> is a context sensitive poem littered with personal pronouns such as 'me'<ref target="BAWE_3008g-ftnote.001"/> which make it a highly personal exploration of self and belonging. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p2.16">The colourful tone almost belies the introspective side of the poem. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p2.16">This arises from Bennett's examination of the problematic nature of displacement. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p2.16">The importance of culture, place and language dominate the poem. </s>
</p>
<note place="foot" id="BAWE_3008g-ftnote.001">
<p n="pn1.1">
<s n="s1.1;pn1.1">Louise Bennett, 'Homesickness' in the <hi rend="underlined">The Heinemann Book of Caribean Poetry</hi>, selected by S.Brown and I.McDonald (Oxford:Heinemann,1992), p11. </s>
</p>
</note>
<p n="p3.16">
<s n="s1.5;p3.16">Similitude between the poems can be seen from the outset. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p3.16">The declarative sentence that opens <hi rend="underlined">Gruoch</hi> has almost defiant and audacious undertones that imply a strong sense of pride and confidence in the speaker's identity; 'I have a name of my own.'<ref target="BAWE_3008g-ftnote.002"/>(l.1) A caesura breaks the rhythm of the line and focuses our attention on her name thus emphasising its importance. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p3.16">It is resolutely Gruoch's poem; Bolam adopts her persona and voice thus embedding her presence firmly in the poem. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p3.16">Bolam's amalgamation of differing poetic devises and structural elements forms the basis of a unique free verse that lacks constructional restriction. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p3.16">This allows Gruoch to express her feelings and assert her independence in an unimpeded manner. </s>
</p>
<note place="foot" id="BAWE_3008g-ftnote.002">
<p n="pn1.1">
<s n="s1.1;pn1.1">Robyn Bolym, 'Gruoch' in the <hi rend="underlined">English Studies Book</hi>,Rob Pope (London: Routledge,2001) p355,l.1. </s>
</p>
</note>
<p n="p4.16">
<s n="s1.6;p4.16">The authenticity of the narrator's voice in <hi rend="underlined">Home Sickness</hi> is created through the use of Jamaican Creole. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p4.16">
<hi rend="underlined">Home Sickness</hi> betrays Bennett's firm linguistic fingerprint due to the use of idiodialect and Afro-Caribbean phonetics. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p4.16">The use of native grammar and spellings i.e. 'fi,' 'an,' and 'dem' helps demonstrate the heteroglossia of the English language. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p4.16">It also allows Bennett to remain faithful to her roots by expressing herself in the Jamaican vernacular. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p4.16">This is reminiscent of Gillian Clarke's technique in the poem <hi rend="underlined">A letter from a far country.</hi> </s>
<s n="s6.6;p4.16">She also used the influence of her native language to create her own personalised poetic voice that allowed her assert her identity and sense of self. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.16">
<s n="s1.5;p5.16">As an English writer, Bolam doesn't write in the Scottish vernacular as Scots writers such as Lochhead and Leonard do, but she succeeds in making <hi rend="underlined">Gruoch</hi> context sensitive through allusions to Scottish history. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p5.16">The use of Creole idiom in <hi rend="underlined">Home Sickness</hi> effects the pronunciation and placement of certain stresses and can vary syllable length, thus making scansion difficult. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p5.16">The overall effect of <hi rend="underlined">Gruoch</hi> suggests that it is written in tetrameter, but this is not a consistent pattern as the number of feet generally differs slightly per line. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p5.16">The lack of a regular stress pattern in <hi rend="underlined">Gruoch</hi> reflects the lack of stability within Gruoch's life and identity. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p5.16">Variable use of enjambment, end stopping and apostrophes that coincide with both clauses and sentence breaks, adds to the poem's unique and inconsistent rhythmic effect. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.16">
<s n="s1.7;p6.16">Sociolect and allusions to everyday and somewhat stereotypical aspects of Jamaican life i.e. 'black smaddy'(l.22) ensures that <hi rend="underlined">Home Sickness</hi> , like <hi rend="underlined">Gruoch</hi> is heavily context dependant. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p6.16">Our understanding as British readers can be impeded by the use of Jamaican Creole. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p6.16">Afro-Caribbean dispora can make establishing the meaning and nuance of certain unfamiliar words such as 'nyam'(l.5) and 'gwan'(l.6) difficult. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p6.16">
<hi rend="underlined">Home Sickness</hi> betrays the influence of African slave poetry's aural traditions, as it too has been written for informal oral presentation. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p6.16">The use of elision i.e. 'people-dem'(l.14) and enjambment, conveys the animated energy and natural rhythm of the narrator's colloquial speaking voice. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p6.16">Ellipsis adds to this effect as it is a common feature in routine speech; i.e. 'coaknut'(l.1) and 'galang'(l.24) as opposed to go along. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p6.16">Enjambment creates a lyrical quality that allows the reader to be carried along by a tide of astute and perspicacious comments that elevate Bennett's rhetorical deftness, whilst providing a flowing rhythm that evokes the relaxed flow of life in the Caribbean. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.16">
<s n="s1.7;p7.16">In <hi rend="underlined">Home Sickness</hi>, pungent and evocative gustatory imagery relating to food i.e. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p7.16">'Fi a dumplin, a duckoonoo,'(l.9) remind the narrator of how exotic and therefore distant her homeland is. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p7.16">These collocations are strikingly new for some readers but comfortingly familiar to the narrator. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p7.16">Her longing for Jamaica is conveyed through allusions to thirst and hunger; 'But me belly dissa holler/ fi a plate a rice and peas.'(l.7-8) </s>
<s n="s5.7;p7.16">This phrase can be interpreted as a metaphor. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p7.16">The active and transitive verb 'holler,' implies an almost angry desire and desperation to go home due to the onomatopoeic nature of the word. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p7.16">An image of salivation reinforces her sense of depravation and suffering, and is created through the parallelism of similar word and sound structures in the line; 'An me mout-top start fi water/ Me mout-corner start fi foam.' (l.29-30) </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.16">
<s n="s1.7;p8.16">The binary themes of displacement and belonging dominate the poem. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p8.16">The unrelenting and fierce heat of the 'broiling sun'(l.3) reflects the strength and intensity of the narrator's love for Jamaica. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p8.16">This is then juxtaposed with the paradoxical cooling and soothing properties of the sea. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p8.16">A similar technique is employed in the third stanza in comparing the disparity between the hot spice and ice. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p8.16">Juxtaposition and antithesis fortify the theme of division in the poem as the narrator appears divided between her homeland and England. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p8.16">The proliferation of exclamatory sentences and humour jars somewhat with the poem's underlying seriousness. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p8.16">For example, the incongruity and improbability of seeing a; 'hairy mango pon de road!' (l.28) in England, both amuses and saddens the narrator by reminding her of the divergence and distance between both places. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.16">
<s n="s1.7;p9.16">Bennett uses mainly nouns and verbs that relate to place and movement. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p9.16">A recurrent travelling motif arises through references to roads and roaming. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p9.16">The repetition of 'galang'(l.24)creates a kinaesthetic image that adds movement to both her literal and metaphorical journey to discover where her home lies. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p9.16">The metaphor; 'A dose a hungry buckle-hole me'(l.31) conveys a sense of being incomplete as 'hole' and 'hunger' imply that she is missing something. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p9.16">Being away from Jamaica deprives her of a part of her identity. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p9.16">The repetition of the vowel sound in the word 'waan,'(l.32) creates a noise similar to a wail that sounds almost like a child's cry. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p9.16">Like a child, the narrator looks to her family for comfort and security. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.16">
<s n="s1.8;p10.16">Both poems contain ambiguous elements that create exploitable connotations within the language. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p10.16">Bolam's ambivalent use of the pronoun 'he' ensures that we are never sure who she is discussing. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p10.16">We can only assume it's Gillecomgain in the first stanza and then Macbeth. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p10.16">In <hi rend="underlined">Homesickness</hi>, ambiguity is used in the final stanza to help us share the narrator's confusion and to relate the complexity of narrator's relationship with Jamaica. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p10.16">Exclamatory sentences ensure that the poem ends on a sanguine note, but a sense of loss and depravation continues to pervade the poem. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p10.16">Whilst the narrator feels relived to find a reason to belong in England, the interrogative structure of the sentence 'to me wha?,'(l.34) implies that she remains unsure about what exactly binds her to Jamaica. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p10.16">Bennett's use of the possessive pronoun me in 'me Jamaica' (l.33) is somewhat ironic. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p10.16">The narrator implies that she possesses Jamaica, when in reality, it is the country that owns her- her history and culture is embedded in Jamaica and will therefore always bind her. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.16">
<s n="s1.7;p11.16">The importance of family, roots and a sense of belonging is also explored in <hi rend="underlined">Gruoch</hi> ; Gruoch's pride in her ancestry resembles Bennett's pride in her homeland and language. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p11.16">Gruoch is a figure associated with female strength and influence largely due to Shakespeare's portrayal of the ruthless and manipulative Lady Macbeth. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p11.16">Unlike Gruoch, Lady Macbeth sees her feminine tenderness as a sign of weakness, demanding; 'Unsex me here/ and fill me from the crown to the toe-full/ of direst cruelly'<ref target="BAWE_3008g-ftnote.003"/>, whereas Gruoch relishes her carnal sexuality. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p11.16">The poem moves into the progressive present tense during the first stanza thus crating a frenzied and passionate immediacy around the sexual action. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p11.16">Active and transitive verbs such as, 'crush'(l.3) and 'grasping'(l.5) create both claustrophobic and violent sexual images that convey the all-consuming desire and intimacy of the moment. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p11.16">The scene could be interpreted as one of violation as Gruoch appears powerless and oppressed by his actions. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p11.16">Consonance i.e. 'grasping it in his fists,'(l.5) creates a breathless excitement within the tone that infers that whilst he has physical dominance, she actually controls the situation in creating the desire that drives his actions. </s>
</p>
<note place="foot" id="BAWE_3008g-ftnote.003">
<p n="pn1.1">
<s n="s1.2;pn1.1">William Shakespeare,<hi rend="underlined"> Macbeth,</hi>edited by G.K. Hunter.(London: Penguin,1995) </s>
<s n="s2.2;pn1.1">I.5.l 39-41 </s>
</p>
</note>
<p n="p12.16">
<s n="s1.10;p12.16">Bolam's dextrous manipulation of language allows her to evolve the simile 'like a tent ' (l.7) into a metaphor for sex; 'folds slipped open.'(l.8) </s>
<s n="s2.10;p12.16">Phallic images are created through allusions to 'rope'(l.6) and a 'stake.'(l.7) </s>
<s n="s3.10;p12.16">The tent image is developed further in the line; 'succulent as split stems.'(l.9) </s>
<s n="s4.10;p12.16">The fricative sibilance here suggests that it this a welcome act due to the indulgent and sensual nature of these sounds. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p12.16">Gruoch, like this image and its representation, undergoes a process of transformation throughout the poem. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p12.16">She changes from sexual being to mother, wife to queen. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p12.16">We must therefore question the degree of power she has over her life and identity. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p12.16">It would seem that men are responsible for controlling and defining her role. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p12.16">Like Gruoch, the way her name is said metamorphoses. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p12.16">It is a guttural and primitive 'growl'(l.2) when she is immersed in animalistic sexual behaviour; then uttered in wonder when she is Queen, thus conveying the reverence and respect she deserves and ends as a whisper when she beings to lose faith in her self and power. </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.16">
<s n="s1.3;p13.16">Gruoch is seen at the height of her power in the second stanza, portrayed as more influential and efficacious than war and all other women; 'war nor wantons wrenched him from me.'(l.20) </s>
<s n="s2.3;p13.16">Gruoch's resilience and tenacity is elevated here thus making her impotence in the final stanza more dramatic, 'Seventeen years we reigned together through/ keen seasons of hunger, feasting one to other.'(l.18-19) </s>
<s n="s3.3;p13.16">Images of hunger and nourishment are reminiscent of those in Bennett's poem; the narrator wishes to satiate her hunger by feasting on her country's food, whereas Gruoch and Macbeth feast upon one another and their power. </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.16">
<s n="s1.14;p14.16">Collocations relating to death such as 'obsequies,'(l.23) make the third stanza a lament about the death of love. </s>
<s n="s2.14;p14.16">The adjective 'dry'(l.23) implies that their bed is arid and barren; devoid of life and fire. </s>
<s n="s3.14;p14.16">Gruoch, like Bennett is overcome by thirst, but her thirst is for love and passion. </s>
<s n="s4.14;p14.16">A metaphorical winter has descend between them, as their relationship has become cold and insipid. </s>
<s n="s5.14;p14.16">There is no warmth to ensure that 'buds' are 'stirring.'(l.25). </s>
<s n="s6.14;p14.16">Opportunistic alliteration in the line 'my mouth meandered', could be interpreted as a metaphor for the kiss of life, as she attempts to revive their passion and give new life to their love. </s>
<s n="s7.14;p14.16">Her failure to do so makes her feel impotent and powerless. </s>
<s n="s8.14;p14.16">Having lost her ability to control men through their sexual desire for her, Gruoch feels that her identity has been diminished. </s>
<s n="s9.14;p14.16">Bennett too makes use of occasional and opportunistic alliteration i.e. 'beefy, blacky.'(l.27) </s>
<s n="s10.14;p14.16">The funeral motif in the final stanza ensures that a palpable sense of loss and bereavement permeates the poem. </s>
<s n="s11.14;p14.16">By the end her name is 'despairing: our death rattle.'(l.26) </s>
<s n="s12.14;p14.16">These plosive sounds submerge us in Gruoch's anguish and regret whilst adding to the dark and menacing nature of the 'death rattle.' </s>
<s n="s13.14;p14.16">The colon following 'despairing' creates a finality that implies nothing can bring their passion back. </s>
<s n="s14.14;p14.16">This melancholic, despondent and subdued ending contrasts starkly with the confidence of the opening. </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.16">
<s n="s1.9;p15.16">The visual form of the poems differ. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p15.16">In <hi rend="underlined">Gruoch</hi>, the stanza length decreases. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p15.16">This reflects the gradual death of passion in Gruoch's life. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p15.16">The poem ebbs and fades away leaving us with the strong sense of loss. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p15.16">Unlike <hi rend="underlined">Gruoch</hi>, <hi rend="underlined">Home Sickness</hi> has a measured and regular structure that consists of nine quatrains. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p15.16">This, along with the systematic and structural use of rhyme between each second and final line, contrasts with the inconsistency of the narrator's emotional journey. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p15.16">There is an internal rhyme within <hi rend="underlined">Gruoch</hi> at the start of the second stanza that emphasises the significance of certain words. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p15.16">The rhyme arises because there are thirteen syllables before 'daughter'(l.17) and thirteen syllables before 'slaughter. '(l.15) </s>
<s n="s9.9;p15.16">Both poets therefore use their verbal artistry to manipulate form and language. </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.16">
<s n="s1.3;p16.16">Whilst there is marked diversity between the thematic content, rhetoric and grammatical form of the poems, the poets employ some similar poetic techniques to manifest their notions. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p16.16">Both poets strive to express their voice in a way that is both eloquent and authentic. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p16.16">The divergence regarding the cultural and linguistic influences upon the poets ensures that their works are acutely individual. </s>
