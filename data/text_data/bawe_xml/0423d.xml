<s n="s1.2;p30.37">At the outset, careful case selection is imperative,<ref target="BAWE_0423d-ftnote.048"/> and ought to be founded on an informed understanding of the extent to which housing rights are considered justiciable in the relevant jurisdiction. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p30.37">Whether the litigation utilising the international right to housing has succeeded has often been dependent upon the extent to which courts exercised judicial restraint, such restraint generally increasing as the selected claims extended along the continuum of the duties to respect, to protect, or to fulfil, with their progressive impact on the respective state resources.<ref target="BAWE_0423d-ftnote.049"/> In addition to establishing connections between a number of human rights, as noted above, some advocates have employed a strategy of including within their claims detailed examples of alternatives to the treatment of people suffering housing rights violations (with considered input from relevant community members, architects or examples from other jurisdictions), for the court's consideration, therefore making it easier for courts to comprehend the parameters and viability of the remedy sought, rather than expecting the court to design new policy itself.<ref target="BAWE_0423d-ftnote.050"/> </s>

<s n="s1.1;p35.37">The purpose of this essay was to examine one of the human rights strategies applied by housing rights advocates in a domestic setting, namely the use of the international right to housing in domestic courts, in order to consider the potential for this strategy to effect practical benefit for housing conditions at the local level. </s>
</p>
<p n="p36.37">
<s n="s1.2;p36.37">The discussion above reveals that this approach has yielded some very successful outcomes and, even in circumstances where the actual legal outcome was not favourable, the strength and authoritative nature of the international human rights regime lends weight to the legitimacy of housing rights in local settings generally. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p36.37">This is particularly enhanced when combined with a complementary social mobilisation movement in relation to the particular issues. </s>
</p>
<p n="p37.37">
<s n="s1.1;p37.37">Accordingly, housing rights advocates would be wise to consider this as a central strategy, where appropriate in the circumstances, but at the very least, a significant component of their wider housing rights campaigns. </s>
