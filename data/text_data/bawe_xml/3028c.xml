<head rend="italic">1) Selfish Genes and Group Selection</head>
<p n="p1.75">
<s n="s1.4;p1.75">The term 'selfish gene', was originally coined by Richard Dawkins in his book <hi rend="italic">The Selfish Gene</hi> (1976). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p1.75">Dawkins argues that the fundamental unit of selection, and therefore of self-interest, is not the species, nor the group, nor even, strictly the individual. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p1.75">It is the gene, the unit of heredity. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p1.75">Dawkins does not define the term 'gene' by way of a cistron, the genetic material between START and END codons; he defines it as G.C. Williams does in <hi rend="italic">Adaptation and Natural Selection:</hi> </s>
</p>
<quote lang="English">I use the term gene to mean 'that which segregates and recombines with appreciable frequency.'... A gene could be defined as any hereditary information for which there is a favourable or unfavourable selection bias equal to several or many times its rate of endogenous exchange. (1966: 26)</quote>
<p n="p2.75">
<s n="s1.5;p2.75">For Dawkins, a gene is defined as any portion of a chromosomal material that potentially lasts for enough generations to serve as a unit of natural selection, a genetic unit small enough not to be frequently split by crossing-over during meiosis (which could constituted of many cistrons), and to be distributed around in the form of many copies. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p2.75">In Dawkins's words 'a gene is a replicator of high copying fidelity' (1989: 28). </s>
<s n="s3.5;p2.75">For such a genetic unit to be selected, and proliferate in individual 'survival machines' the predominant quality to be expected to in the successful gene is ruthless selfishness. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p2.75">This gene selfishness will usually give rise to selfishness in individual behaviour. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p2.75">However, there are circumstances exist in which a gene can achieve its own selfish goals best by fostering a limited form of altruism at the level of individuals. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.75">
<s n="s1.10;p3.75">The apparently suicidal altruistic acts observable in some social species has led theorists such as V. C. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p3.75">Wynne-Edwards to come up with interpretations of group selection in which the individual acts "for the good of the species", natural selection acting on the group or species. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p3.75">As Dawkins demonstrates in terms of selfish genes, it is an untenable position and a misunderstanding of the evolutionary process. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p3.75">In his book <hi rend="italic">The Social Contract</hi> (1970), Ardrey gives the example of the stotting high jumps of certain Thomson's gazelles when a predator is spotted as if to alert the remaining group of its presence, and whose apparently suicidal altruism moved him to categorically state that it could only be explained by group selection. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p3.75">The stotting of the gazelle is deliberately inviting to the attention of the predator, almost as if the gazelle is teasing the predator. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p3.75">This has lead to further interpretative theory by A. Zahavi (1977) who suggests the act of the gazelle is primarily selected as a signal to the predator, roughly translated it means: "Look how high I can jump, I am obviously such a fir and healthy gazelle, you can't catch me, you would be much wiser to try and catch my neighbour who is not jumping so high!" </s>
<s n="s7.10;p3.75">(1989: 171). </s>
<s n="s8.10;p3.75">Many mammal predators tend to attack the easy to catch, the old and weak, so in this respect the gazelle advertising its fitness in an exaggerated way is showing that it is neither old nor weak, and that the predator should look to his neighbours for a meal. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p3.75">Living in large groups has its individual selfish benefits, benefiting a gene for 'stotting' within the individual survival machine. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p3.75">According to this theory the gazelle's display is far from altruistic. </s>
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="italic">2) Altruism and Kin Selection</head>
<p n="p4.75">
<s n="s1.6;p4.75">Prior to 1964, no theorist had come up with a satisfactory answer to the apparent altruistic acts that some individuals perform within groups. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p4.75">An example of this could be a group of vervet monkeys (Cheney &amp; Seyfarth) an individual within which gives off an alarm call in sight of a various predators, though making itself more conspicuous. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p4.75">The question was; how does such an altruistic behaviour arise in evolutionary terms when it so obviously lowers the genetic fitness of the individual giving the call? </s>
<s n="s4.6;p4.75">And in comparison raises fitness of the individuals of the rest of the group who did not call, and can not call. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p4.75">As shown with the failings of group selection behaviours can not be selected just because they are beneficial to the group as a whole. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p4.75">Instead according to this example selection will favour genes for suppressing calling. </s>
</p>
<quote lang="English">Natural Selection can favour altruistic behaviour if altruistic individuals are more likely to interact with each other than chance alone would dictate. (Boyd &amp; Silk 2003: 210)</quote>
<p n="p5.75">
<s n="s1.5;p5.75">An understanding of this behaviour came with W.D. Hamilton's 1964 maths based paper <hi rend="italic">The Genetic Evolution of Social Behaviour</hi> who made a series of fundamental contribution to the theory of evolutionary behaviour. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p5.75">Hamilton's insight was to see that any process that benefits altruists to be more likely to interact with other altruists than they would by chance could facilitate the evolution of altruism. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p5.75">Now if regard groups as breeding populations containing the kin group and extended members, if an individual is a caller by the rules of Mendelian genetics there is a 50 percent chance a sibling will share the genes for calling, and related percentages of chance for other family members (percentage of relatedness). </s>
<s n="s4.5;p5.75">Hamilton's theory of kin selection is based on the idea that selection could favour altruistic alleles if individuals interact selectively with genetic relatives. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p5.75">According to Hamilton's rule a behaviour will be favoured by selection if: </s>

<s n="s1.1;p8.75">
<formula notation="" id="BAWE_3028c-form.002"/> </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.75">
<s n="s1.1;p9.75">Hamilton's rule leads to two important insights: </s>
</p>
<list type="bulleted">
<item>Altruism is limited to kin.</item>
<item>Closer kinship facilitates more costly altruism. (Boyd &amp; Silk 2003: 214)</item>
</list>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="italic">3) Reciprocal Altruism</head>
<p n="p10.75">
<s n="s1.4;p10.75">The theory of reciprocal altruism was originally introduced by Robert Trivers, 1971 in <hi rend="italic">The Evolution of Reciprocal Altruism</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p10.75">This is the idea that altruistic behaviour can evolve in a balanced relationship of interacting individuals. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p10.75">In these reciprocal relationships individuals can turn being the actor and recipient, in this respect reciprocal altruism is favoured by selection because over time the fitness gained by the reciprocal acts outweighs the cost incurred. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p10.75">Boyd and Silk (2003: 222) suggest there are three conditions occurring together that favour the development of reciprocal altruism, individuals must: </s>
</p>
<list type="ordered">
<item>1) have opportunity to interact often,</item>
<item>2) have the ability to keep track of support given and received, and</item>
<item>3) provide support only to those who help them,</item>
</list>
<p n="p11.75">
<s n="s1.6;p11.75">It is important to note that exchange does not have to be in kind. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p11.75">As shown with vervet monkeys (Cheney &amp; Seyfarth) and other primates such as chimpanzees, for example, the act of grooming an individual can be reciprocated by the recipient by way of political coalitionary support, and other such examples. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p11.75">The big problem with reciprocal altruism is that it is costly to interact with individuals who do not reciprocate. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p11.75">Thus human cognition (and the cognition of other relevant mammals) should be attune to look for cheaters in social exchanges. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p11.75">Game theory, such as the 'Prisoner's Dilemma' explored by Axelrod (1984) (also in collaboration with W.D. Hamilton, 1981) demonstrates the logical problems of a behaviour for exchange, and can also shed light on the selective process of evolutionary altruistic behaviour. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p11.75">If there is only to ever be one exchange between individuals it is always most self-serving to not to co-operate, but with iterated exchanges so called 'nice' strategies are most beneficial to the individual, the most successful by way of 'Tit-for-Tat'. </s>

<div1 type="section">
<head rend="italic">4) Innate and Environmental Influences</head>
<p n="p12.75">
<s n="s1.6;p12.75">I'm sure the debate of this subject has been and will be contained within the covers of very many large volumes of work. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p12.75">It is possible to say for definite a very intimate relationship exists between what is innate within us by way of programming of genetic information, and that of facts of mere physics. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p12.75">When observing any organism other than ourselves (to a lesser extent maybe our closest genetic primate relatives) we can, and do easily recognise behaviour in individuals that can be generalised across all individuals within the species, behaviours that are so universal to that species that they must be innately encrypted within its genome. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p12.75">Multitudes of universals exist within human behaviour as documented by Donald E. Brown (1991), humans has large amount of diversity in environmental habitation, yet it is manifest we have a distinct material human nature universal to all of us, whatever our environment. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p12.75">If we take human language acquisition for example; opposing arguments against any theory of innateness appear thin on the ground. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p12.75">Chomsky himself professes to be puzzled at any objections to an innate hypothesis, in that an empirically determined language would be immediately problematic: </s>
</p>
<quote lang="English">Is the idea supposed to be that there is no [relevant] difference between my granddaughter, her pet kitten, a rock, a chimpanzee? No one can be that crazy. But if there is a relevant difference, then we must accept the 'innatist scenario.' So what can we possibly be under discussion, except for the nature of the innate endowment? (Smith 1999:170)</quote>
<p n="p13.75">
<s n="s1.1;p13.75">A mind of any variety can not be a blank slate, a <hi rend="italic">tabula rasa</hi>, you cannot get something form nothing. </s>
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="italic">5) Social: Solitary and Gregarious</head>
<p n="p14.75">
<s n="s1.4;p14.75">If we take the social organisation of primates for example; most diurnal and some nocturnal species are <hi rend="italic">gregarious</hi> - they feed, travel and sleep in groups. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p14.75">Their social complexity can range from the most primitive form, the noyau, which characterises most primitive nocturnal mammals, up to the large complex societies of gelada baboons comprising of up to 800 individuals, when composed of the joining of bands. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p14.75">There is a fine line between defining the simplistic gregarious primate and the <hi rend="italic">solitary</hi> primate species. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p14.75">A solitary system in primates could operate much like the noyau system, and yet unlike in the noyau the male who has fathered some offspring will not regularly access the development of the offspring, an example such a solitary system could be the orang-utan. </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.75">
<s n="s1.2;p15.75">Robert Trivers explains in evolutionary terms the evolution of fundamental social organisation in his thesis of 'Parental Investment' (1972): "any investment by the parent in an individual offspring that increases the offspring's chance of surviving at the cost of the parent's ability to invest in other offspring". </s>
<s n="s2.2;p15.75">The determining factors for this are measures of resources that a parent can invest, the variable being the environment. </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.75">
<s n="s1.1;p16.75">Other environmental factors governing formation social structure and constituent numbers are factors such as protection from predators, access to mates, assistance in protecting and rearing offspring, and improved access to food. </s>

</p>
<p n="p18.75">
<s n="s1.1;p18.75">As point out by Trivers (1972), the mammalian reproductive system commits females to invest in their offspring, making some mating systems a more likely option than others. </s>

<hi rend="italic">Monogamy -</hi> one female forms a mating bond with one male. </s>

<s n="s2.3;p22.75">Though, there is no truly promiscuous system among primates, the nearest of which being among bonobos, because of the universal inhibiting behaviour among mammals of <hi rend="italic">inbreeding avoidance</hi>. </s>

<div1 type="section">
<head rend="italic">7) Inbreeding Avoidance</head>
<p n="p23.75">
<s n="s1.10;p23.75">Inbreeding avoidance among closely related kin is a 'human universal' (Donald E. Brown 1991). </s>
<s n="s2.10;p23.75">Humans that share large amounts of time in proximity in early childhood are not sexually attracted to each other when sexually mature, this explains partly why humans rarely mate with close relatives, although incestuous defined boundaries vary among societies. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p23.75">Evidence of this also from the attempted utopian communities of the Israeli kibbutzim, Spepher (1971) demonstrated for collected data that out 2769 marriages in 211 kibbutzim, only 14 marriages were from the same kibbutz, in all cases one partner joined the peer group after the age of six. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p23.75">Such a strong aversion to incestuous relationships is also demonstrated among primates and other mammals, in social mammals incest is usually prevented by the emigration of sub-adult males form the social group. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p23.75">Although less common, for example in chimpanzees and gorillas it is the sub-adult female that transfers between groups (Nishida 1979). </s>
<s n="s6.10;p23.75">Female chimpanzees after their first oestrus typically alter their range and are no longer associated with their male siblings. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p23.75">Yet, as Pusey (1980) observed; mother and sons share the same range yet never copulate even when the mother is in oestrus. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p23.75">In some cases the individuals are physically expelled from the natal group, as is the case with gibbons. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p23.75">In evolutionary terms such a behaviour of inhibition makes perfect sense, recessive deleterious genes carried by an individual are more likely to be combined in incestuous parent/child, sibling/sibling offspring, the chance of sharing the same deleterious gene being 50 percent. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p23.75">Evidence of this penalty is widely shown, for example E.O. Wilson (1978) showed in a survey from Czechoslovakia; of the 161 children born of mother/son mating 15 were stillborn, and 40 percent in total suffered from physical and mental defects. </s>

</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="italic">8) Social Tradition</head>
<p n="p24.75">
<s n="s1.10;p24.75">The transmission of a belief, of set of beliefs passed on from one generation to the next by learning, that affects the behaviour of individuals within the society concerned. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p24.75">The cultural relativist might suggest our social traditions are created by society on a purely logical basis, to aid economic relationships and marriage between groups and so on, but in many cases there is an obvious determinant connection with our biological basis, although the relationship is often unclear. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p24.75">An example of this in continuation from the last definition could be the human universal of incest taboo (Brown 1991). </s>
<s n="s4.10;p24.75">There appears to be an immediate link between incest taboo of social tradition, and innate behaviour for inbreeding avoidance as witnessed in the Israeli kibbutzim (Spepher 1971). </s>
<s n="s5.10;p24.75">Anthropologists such as Levi-Strauss (1969) offer interpretation in a wholly culturally relativist sense, and maintain that humans acquire incest taboo purely by social tradition; For many activities families must co-operate with each other, for example hunting. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p24.75">Alliances between families can be cemented by intermarriage, fathers giving away their daughters. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p24.75">In many societies the groom has to pay a bride price, in some the groom has to buy his wife by working for her kin, and in others gifts are exchanges between families. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p24.75">If such a system is workable in is essential incest be prevented, daughters must be married into other families and sons must be free to look for brides outside their immediate family. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p24.75">On this view incest taboo is universal because it is essential to form alliances between families. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p24.75">As shown, this may be a very naïve view in light of empirical evidence and cross-comparative study among primates, a self important anthropocentric view. </s>
