<head rend="bold">Introduction</head>
<p n="p1.61">
<s n="s1.5;p1.61">Perfection Hotels is a small UK-based hospitality company, currently operating 3 hotels in the major UK cities, one in London, Birmingham and Glasgow respectively. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p1.61">All the hotels are operating under the same brand, where they strive to provide "the perfect hospitality experience" to their guests. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p1.61">The hotel group is relatively new in the market, and has decided to grow and become a bigger player in the market through international expansion. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p1.61">However, due to the lack of international experience, the first country in which to expand to could not be very different to the UK. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p1.61">(More information about Perfection Hotels in Appendix 1-Company Profile). </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.61">
<s n="s1.5;p2.61">Canada is the second largest country in the world, located north of the United States in North America. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p2.61">With a population of almost 33 million, the country has developed in parallel with the US both technologically and economically (<seg type="URL" n="www.cia.gov"/>), and is today ranked among the most developed countries in the world (<seg type="URL" n="www.icongroupedition.com"/>). </s>
<s n="s3.5;p2.61">Canada became self-governing in 1867, but still has close ties to the United Kingdom (<seg type="URL" n="www.cia.gov"/>). </s>
<s n="s4.5;p2.61">These ties and the high level of development makes the Canadian business environment quite similar to the UK environment, and therefore Canada was pointed out as an appropriate country to enter for Perfection Hotels' expansion plans. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p2.61">(More information about Canada in Appendix 1-Country Profile).) </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.61">
<s n="s1.4;p3.61">Perfection Hotels has been very successful in the luxury, 5 star market sector. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p3.61">This market is highly competitive, and the hotels are described in superlative terms and far exceed normal expectations in terms of design, level of luxus, service, elegance and uniqueness (Nebel <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 1994). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p3.61">Jackson and Haid (in Moore and Birtwistle, 2005) argues that luxury brands have a high status and possess a desirability that extends beyond their function. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p3.61">The target market for Perfection Hotels are both leisure and business travellers, but they emphasizes the business market, both domestic and internationally. </s>
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">Business Environment</head>
<p n="p4.61">
<s n="s1.3;p4.61">Expanding a hospitality operation internationally can be problematic, and in order to be effective and efficient in the task a company must respond to the opportunities, challenges, risks, and limitations posed by the macro business environment (Costa, in Wu <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 1998). </s>
<s n="s2.3;p4.61">Evans <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p4.61">(2003, p.156) defines the macro environment as "the broad environment outside of an organisation's industry and markets", and Reich (1997) concludes that companies in general has very little control over it. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.61">
<s n="s1.2;p5.61">The business environment in Canada is in many ways similar to the UK. Both countries are political stable, and are ranked in the top in terms of level of democracy, corruption, press freedom and civil/political rights (<seg type="URL" n="www.carleton.ca"/>). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p5.61">They also have </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.61">
<s n="s1.5;p6.61">affluent, advanced industrial economies with a farily high level of privatisation, and both Canada and the UK rank among the most developed countries in the world (<seg type="URL" n="www.eiu.com"/>). </s>
<s n="s2.5;p6.61">The structure of their economies is service-dominated, making them high income countries where people enjoy very high standards of living (<seg type="URL" n="www.cia.gov"/>). </s>
<s n="s3.5;p6.61">A concern for the Canadian economy, however, is the oil prices. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p6.61">Cold weather and large distances make the energy consumption in Canada double that of the G7 average. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p6.61">Thus, if the oil prices remain high and/or increase in the future, people will be forced to spend more on energy, which again will affect the GDP and the spending in other industries such as hospitality negatively (Tal, 2004). </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.61">
<s n="s1.6;p7.61">Religion is not a major influence when conducting business either in Canada or the UK, and both countries can be identified as rather secular than religious (Nations of the World, 2004). </s>
<s n="s2.6;p7.61">Neither will there be any technological issues. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p7.61">Both countries have a well developed Information Communication Technology (ICT ) sector, and the governments are investing equally in ICT in their respective countries (<seg type="URL" n="www.oecd.org"/>). </s>
<s n="s4.6;p7.61">The infrastructure in Canada and the UK are of a very high level (<seg type="URL" n="www.cia.gov"/>), meaning that transportation of tourists and potential guests from international as well as domestic destinations will not become an issue. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p7.61">Using media as marketing channels will also be similar in the two countries, but a much higher percentage of Canada's population are connected to the internet (<seg type="URL" n="www.oecd.org"/>), giving extra opportunities to reach potential customers. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p7.61">(See Appendix 2 for business environment statistics). </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.61">
<s n="s1.5;p8.61">In addition to the many similarities between the Canadian and British business environment, there are two major differences which will affect Perfection Hotels when entering Canada. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p8.61">First, Canada is a member of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), an agreement eliminating all tariffs between Canada, US and Mexico. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p8.61">It also provides a phased reduction of non-tariff barriers, making it the largest free trade zone in the world (Taplin, 2003). </s>
<s n="s4.5;p8.61">The UK, on the other hand, is a member of the European Union (EU), who's goal is to strenghten the economy in Europe through an internal free market within the community, with common external trade barriers to the rest of the world (Reilly, 1995). </s>
<s n="s5.5;p8.61">Dealing with NAFTA instead of the EU will have some economic impacts, and Perfection Hotels must also deal with a new trading system. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.61">
<s n="s1.5;p9.61">Second, the ethnic diversity in Canada makes the business environment more complicated than in the UK. Around 400 years ago, when North America was colonised, the British settled on the east coast of the US, while French people settled in Quebec and the Canadian east coast (Sherwood and Hodgkinson, 2005). </s>
<s n="s2.5;p9.61">The following centuries of war and conflicts between the UK and France has lead to a lot of tension between people with French and British origin (Carroll and Little, 2001). </s>
<s n="s3.5;p9.61">Therefore, Canada appears to be two very different countries, with 75% of the population quite like the US in most ways, and 25% with many similarities to France living mainly in Quebec (Jarvis and Thompson, 1995). </s>
<s n="s4.5;p9.61">However, in spite of these two major differences between Canada and the UK, the business environments in the two countries are very similar. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p9.61">Thus, there would be no major barriers in terms of the business environment when Perfection Hotels are establishing a hotel operation in Canada. </s>
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">Demand Factors</head>
<p n="p10.61">
<s n="s1.3;p10.61">Before expanding internationally, Perfection Hotels must establish the demand for their luxury services in the country. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p10.61">Middleton and Clarke (2001) concludes that the underlying factors for travel and tourism demand are the same in all countries, and Kotler <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p10.61">(2003) argues that the economic variables are the most important set of factors influencing the volume of demand generated. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.61">
<s n="s1.4;p11.61">Canada is one of the wealthiest countries in the world. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p11.61">In 2004, consumer spending increased by 3,4%, and disposable income by 1,7%, expected to rise again with 2,5% in 2005 (<seg type="URL" n="www.statcan.ca"/>). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p11.61">This shows that the domestic market in Canada is in a good economic position, affecting the demand for hospitality services positively. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p11.61">However, as mentioned earlier, high oil prices in the future will have the opposite effect (Tal, 2004). </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.61">
<s n="s1.5;p12.61">Middleton and Clarke (2001) argues that a higher level of education leads to more travel. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p12.61">In terms of government spending on education, Canada ranks second among the G7 countries, and more than 50% of the population are undertaking higher education (<seg type="URL" n="www.eiu.com"/>), meaning that demand for travel is high. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p12.61">They also state that people in largeer cities have a higher demand than those living in rural areas. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p12.61">This is positive for tourism demand in Canada, where almost 50% of the population are living in the 6 largest cities, Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, Ottawa, Calgary and Edmonton respectively (<seg type="URL" n="www.citypopulation.de"/>). </s>
<s n="s5.5;p12.61">In total, 77% of the Canadians are located in urban areas (<seg type="URL" n="www.icongroupedition.com"/>). </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.61">
<s n="s1.6;p13.61">Demand is also strongly affected by holiday entitlement. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p13.61">Canadian people have only 2 weeks paid vacation plus 12 paid holidays during a year. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p13.61">In the largest international market, the US, paid vacations are not required, and there are 10 paid holidays (Kjeldberg <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 2005). </s>
<s n="s4.6;p13.61">This means that tourism demand are weakened, and that other international markets could provide a higher demand. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p13.61">However, Goeldner (in Kandampully, 2000) indicates that technology factors will dramatically alter the tourism demand in the future. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p13.61">Demand in Canada and the US is therefore significantly boosted by the strong development of mass media, information technology such as the internet, as well as the excellent infrastructure (<seg type="URL" n="www.cia.gov"/>). </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.61">
<s n="s1.5;p14.61">To establish demand in Canada, Perfection Hotels also developed a tourist area life cycle (TALC), indication which stage Canada as a tourist destination belong to (Appendix 1, Figure 1). </s>
<s n="s2.5;p14.61">Based on this, Canada is on a consolidation stage, where the rate of tourist arrivals are declining. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p14.61">However, it should be noted that this decline most likely is a result of negative events such as 9/11, economic slowdown in the US, conflicts in Afghanitstan and Iraq, and two outbreaks of SARS in Canada (Loverseed, 2003). </s>
<s n="s4.5;p14.61">Also, the decline is in line with the rest of the region, and the Canadian market share has been stable at 15,5% (<seg type="URL" n="www.world-tourism.org"/>). </s>
<s n="s5.5;p14.61">This suggest that it is a result of worldwide events, instead of Canada dropping in terms of poularity. </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.61">
<s n="s1.3;p15.61">The factors discussed above clearly shows that there in total is a strong demand for travel and tourism in Canada, espescially in the leisure market. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p15.61">Middleton and Clarke (2001) argues that although economic variables is supporting growth for leisure travel in special, developed and strong economies also sustain a large amount of business travel. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p15.61">Thus, demand for domestic business travel in Canada will also be fairly strong. </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.61">
<s n="s1.5;p16.61">According to Levitt (1983, p.93), the world has become globalised over the last decades, and "the world's needs and desires have been irrevocably homogenized". </s>
<s n="s2.5;p16.61">This means that the barriers for international travel have decreased, and travel across national borders increased. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p16.61">Canada's largest international market is without doubt the US, with some demand also provided by the UK market (Table 1). </s>
<s n="s4.5;p16.61">These two countries are, like Canada, highly developed in terms of important demand factors such as economy and technology (<seg type="URL" n="www.cia.gov"/>). </s>
<s n="s5.5;p16.61">When expanding their hospitality business to Canada, Perfection Hotels can therefore, in addition to the strong domestic demand, also expect international demand, from the US in particular. </s>
</p>
<p n="p17.61">
<s n="s1.2;p17.61">Operating in the luxury market sector, a strong and growing national economy is a key factor for the demand for Perfection Hotel's services. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p17.61">A high level of education, as well as the geographical situation with the greater part of the population living in urban areas and cities, will also be critical sources for demand. </s>

<head rend="bold">Supply Factors</head>
<p n="p18.61">
<s n="s1.3;p18.61">The level of competition among firms vary widely across industries, and even within different sectors of an industry (David, 1999), therefore Perfection Hotels must analyse their market sector to gain an understanding of the competitive factors influencing their business. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p18.61">Porter (1980) argues that the intensity of competition within an industry depends on the total effect of five forces, the bargaining power of customers, bargaining power of suppliers, threat of new entrants, threat of substitute products, and finally the rivalry among competitive firms. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p18.61">All these factors can be weighted separately and added together to find the total level of competition in the market sector (Appendix 4, Table I). </s>
</p>
<p n="p19.61">
<s n="s1.5;p19.61">Jayawardena (2003) argues that Canadian tour operators play an essential role in domestic tourism. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p19.61">This strong role make them quite powerful in the industry, being able to press hotel prices down. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p19.61">The hotel industry is also well developed in Canada, with several players operating in the market (<seg type="URL" n="www.canadianhotelguide.com"/>). </s>
<s n="s4.5;p19.61">This gives consumers a great range of choices, increasing their power. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p19.61">The total bargaining power of customers is therefore, with the strong position of tour operators as the most important factor, quite high. </s>
</p>
<p n="p20.61">
<s n="s1.6;p20.61">Canada's food and beverage sector has numerous suppliers of food and beverage products (<seg type="URL" n="www.atn-riae.agr.ca"/>). </s>
<s n="s2.6;p20.61">The competition between the suppliers will push prices down and reduce their power, which is a benefit for the hotel industry. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p20.61">However, the strenght of union in Canada is very high. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p20.61">In a research done by Murray (1993) about union structure, Canada was the only country with an overall increase in union membership and union density from 1970-1989. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p20.61">In addition, Abraham (1997) concludes that Canadian law aid unions in the area of union security. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p20.61">This strongly increases the power of suppliers, making their total bargaining power in the hotel market quite high. </s>
</p>
<p n="p21.61">
<s n="s1.3;p21.61">The capital costs, identified as property and dealer network investments, as well as initial promotion expenses by Bowman (1998), of entering the hotel market are clearly quite high (Evans <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 2003). </s>
<s n="s2.3;p21.61">This also applies to the Canadian market. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p21.61">Also, big players such as Four Seasons, Intercontinental, Starwood and Fairmont to name but a few (<seg type="URL" n="www.canadianhotelguide.com"/>) are dominating the market through economies of scale, making the threat of entry for other hotels into the market fairly low. </s>
</p>
<p n="p22.61">
<s n="s1.3;p22.61">As a result of the many developed information channels such as the internet (<seg type="URL" n="www.cia.gov"/>), combined with the developed Canadian hotel market in all sectors (<seg type="URL" n="www.canadianhotelguide.com"/>), potential hotel guest can easily find substitues for their preferred hotel product. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p22.61">Staying with family and friends is another substitute product, and especially visitors form the UK can choose this option due to the close family ties to Canadians (Sherwood and Hodgkinson, 2005). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p22.61">Substitute products are therefore a serious threat in the hotel industry in Canada. </s>
</p>
<p n="p23.61">
<s n="s1.9;p23.61">According to Haywood (2003), the supply of rooms in the Canadian hotel market has increased steadily from 1998 to 2002, and as a result the total occupancy level has dropped (Appendix 4, Table 2). </s>
<s n="s2.9;p23.61">This is a signal of intense competition in the market. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p23.61">The number of hotels operating in all market sectors also indicates a high level of rivalry. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p23.61">For Perfection Hotels, entering the luxury market, the competitive situation will be a big threat. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p23.61">Their main competitors is Starwood (through it's Sheraton brand), Marriott (Renaissance brand), Hyatt, and Fairmont, which is north Americas largest luxury hotel company (<seg type="URL" n="www.fairmont.com"/>). </s>
<s n="s6.9;p23.61">However, the biggest competitor for Perfection Hotels is Four Seasons, which is a Canadian company offering luxury hotels and resorts (<seg type="URL" n="www.fourseasons.com"/>). </s>
<s n="s7.9;p23.61">All of these players are large, international companies. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p23.61">A smaller player is Metropolitan Hotels (<seg type="URL" n="www.metropolitan.com"/>). </s>
<s n="s9.9;p23.61">With three luxury hotels in the Canadian market only, they are Perfection Hotels' main domestic competitor. </s>

<head rend="bold">Market Attractiveness</head>
<p n="p24.61">
<s n="s1.4;p24.61">The sum of the business environment, total demand, and competition makes up the total attractiveness of the Canadian hotel market. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p24.61">Their business environment is quite similar to the one in the UK, and Canada is political stable and strongly developed in terms of economy and technology. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p24.61">The country risk in Canada, as Contractor and Kundu (1998) refer to as the degree of environmental (i.e political) uncertainty, is therefore quite low. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p24.61">Cultural factors are also similar, however, the ethnic diversity of the British and the French parts of the population must be taken into consideration. </s>
</p>
<p n="p25.61">
<s n="s1.3;p25.61">There is a strong demand for hospitality services in the luxury sector, both in the leisure and the business market. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p25.61">International demand is high, espescially from the US where culture and levels of economic development are similar to the Canadian market (Alexander, 1996). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p25.61">However, in the luxury market there is a high level of competition (Appendix 4, Table 1), with a number of well established brands already operating. </s>
</p>
<p n="p26.61">
<s n="s1.1;p26.61">Overall, the attractiveness of the Canadian hospitality market is very high, as we can see from the attractiveness grid (Appendix 5). </s>
</p>
<p n="p27.61">
<s n="s1.5;p27.61">Expanding into the Canadian market, Perfection Hotels must choose between the three main market entry modes, full ownership, management contracts or franchising (Gannon and Johnson, 1997). </s>
<s n="s2.5;p27.61">Felstead (in Connell, 1997, p.215) defines franchising as "a business relationship whereby a franchisor permits a franchisee to use their brand name, product, or system of business in a specified and ongoing manner in return for a fee", while management contracts are "an arrangement under which operational control of an enterprise...is vested by contract in a separate enterprise which performs the necessary menegement functions in return for a fee" (Young <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s3.5;p27.61">in Gannon and Johnson, 1997, p.194). </s>
<s n="s4.5;p27.61">An ownership, on the other hand, is when a company invest in- and operate a hotel themselves (Contractor and Kundu, 1998), usually achieved through a combination of acquisition and organic growth (Gannon and Johnson, 1997). </s>
<s n="s5.5;p27.61">Each choice has implications for the speed and cost of entry, as well as risk, flexibility, control, profitability and payback within the target market (Gannon, 1993). </s>
</p>
<p n="p28.61">
<s n="s1.6;p28.61">Driscoll and Paliwoda (1997) argues that there are four main factors deciding which modal choice to use, these are control, resource commitment, dissemination and flexibility. </s>

<p n="p38.61">
<s n="s1.6;p38.61">Ethnocentrism is when one's own group is placed in the center and used as a reference for all others, and the symbols and values of that group are regarded as superior (Sumner, in Piron, 2002). </s>

</p>
<p n="p39.61">
<s n="s1.5;p39.61">On the other hand, a polycentric approach is based on the principle that each country is different in terms of culture. </s>

</p>
<p n="p40.61">

<s n="s7.8;p58.61">Perfection Hotels should also use sales promotion in form of frequent guest award to gain relationships with the guests, increasing the opportunity for repeat business. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p58.61">Personal selling is the final part of the promotion mix, and should be used to contact the travel representatives for major Canadian and US corporations, trying to establish long-term relationships and be preferred as the number one choice for their travelling employees. </s>

<head rend="bold">Conclusion</head>
<p n="p59.61">
<s n="s1.6;p59.61">Based on the different sections in this report, there is no doubt that Perfection Hotels should go through with the plans of expanding their luxury hotel business into the Canadian market. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p59.61">The Canadian business is very much similar to the one prevailing in the UK, providing no major barriers. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p59.61">However, the ethnic diversion betweeen the British and French part of the population must be taken into consideration. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p59.61">There is also an established demand for luxury hotel services in the business and leisure market, both domestic and internationally through the US market. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p59.61">On the other hand, competition is quite fierce, but this applies to the hospitality industry in general, and not only to Canada. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p59.61">All factors taken into consideration, Canada is an attractive market for Perfection Hotels expansion plans, and there is a good potential for making profits. </s>
</p>
<p n="p60.61">
<s n="s1.5;p60.61">There are certain limitations in this report. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p60.61">First of all, most of the statistics are collected from various internet sources. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p60.61">These statistics are an essential part of the discussions, and the base for many of the conclusions made throughout the report. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p60.61">There is, however, no guarantee that these sources are accurate or valid. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p60.61">Canadian government web sites can usually be trusted in terms of validity of the content, but since many other internet sources have been used, it must be recognized that some of the statistics in this report, and conclusions based upon the statistics, might not be accurate. </s>
</p>
<p n="p61.61">
<s n="s1.5;p61.61">This report is also based upon a number of journal articles and books. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p61.61">It is trusted that most of the conclusions made, as well as the information provided, by the authors are valid. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p61.61">However, some of that information might not be 100% reliable. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p61.61">Also, the conclusions drawn by these authors might have been biased and triggered by their own opinions instead of the facts, which again make them unreliable. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p61.61">However, whereas internet sources are more likely to be unreliable, most journal articles and books are considered as very reliable sources. </s>
