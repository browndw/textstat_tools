<s n="s4.4;p6.44">Beginning from the roots of the term, the word "ethnic" is related to the concept of an "ethnic community" of which Anthony Smith regards as "a named human population with a myth of common ancestry, shared memories and cultural elements; a link with a historic territory or homeland; and a measure of solidarity".<ref target="BAWE_0137n-ftnote.009"/> Extending this definition, "ethnic conflict" refers to a "dispute about important political, economic, social, cultural or territorial issues between two or more ethnic communities". <ref target="BAWE_0137n-ftnote.010"/> </s>

<s n="s2.4;p7.44">Furthermore, the nature of ethnic conflicts take place within the state, in which homes and families constitute the battlefield hence violence is thus "privatised" with more civilians being drawn into conflict; blurring the boundaries between active belligerents and passive victims. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p7.44">Concomitantly, the stereotype of "aggressive men and pacifist women" <ref target="BAWE_0137n-ftnote.012"/> can be transcended. </s>

<s n="s2.6;p8.44">While the German and Belgian colonial legacy introduced and reinforced notions of race and ethnicity, such notions were further politicised by each respective group as ethnicity became wrapped in the rhetoric of nationalism and power. </s>

<s n="s5.6;p8.44">In view of all these, the state was facing serious threats to its survival and by extension; the dominant Hutu elites began to perceive the Tutsis as a dominant ethnic threat. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p9.44">Similarly, the genocides within the former Yugoslavia territories also occurred due to ethnic incompatibilities within the region. </s>

<s n="s4.6;p9.44">The conflict had its roots in the multi-ethnic make up and the political and demographic demonization of the Serbs. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p9.44">Fundamental to the tensions was the different conceptions for the new state; the Croats and other ethnic minorities favoured federalism while the Serbs argued for greater unity under a Serbian Kingdom. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p9.44">These tensions often erupted into open conflicts, resulting in a repressive regime dominated by the Serb security structure. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p10.44">Closely related to the above examples, ethnicity forms the basis of conflicts in Sri Lanka. </s>

<s n="s3.3;p10.44">Unlike the other two case studies, the Sri Lankan civil war is still an ongoing conflict that started since 1983, predominantly between the Sri Lankan government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil <hi rend="italic">Eelam</hi> (LTTE), a secessionist group which aspires for an independent state named Tamil <hi rend="italic">Eelam</hi> in the North and East of the island. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p11.44">These three case studies are geopolitically diverse enough to encapsulate unique experiences from three different regions of the world and yet conceptually similar to entail a comparative study of women's agency across time and space. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p11.44">All three conflicts can be viewed as being ethno-nationalist in nature and all reveal a similar theme of women victimhood during those wars. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p11.44">Keeping the focus on the notion of women's agency and empowerment, the essay will merely provide the contextual background of each ethnic conflict to the extent that is sufficient as a backdrop to analyze how women fought and transcended gender norms by taking on new challenges and responsibilities in each ethnic conflict. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p13.44">Firstly, we have to confront a disciplinary blindness in war studies which adhere to an essentialist and realist way of approaching women's agency in conflicts.<ref target="BAWE_0137n-ftnote.016"/> Much of the debate surrounding the inclusion of women in the study of international politics, particularly in reflections of war, promotes passive representation through an essentialist approach. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p13.44">Essentialism is a dangerous theoretical concept as it operates through stereotypes and defines a certain relation between men and women. </s>

<s n="s5.7;p13.44">Furthermore, war studies often adopt international relations theories that adhere to realism. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p13.44">As an entrenched ideology, realism is problematic for women as it "traps them in traditionally defined and carefully constructed gendered roles" upon which "the smooth functioning of realist international relations, as a discipline, depends". </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0137n-ftnote.018"/>
<s n="s7.7;p13.44">Effectively, women as passive victims are made invisible and silenced by the realist discourse primarily because their experiences are deemed to function within the private realm.<ref target="BAWE_0137n-ftnote.019"/> Furthermore, the multiple roles women play in ethnic conflicts are simply not recognised in a "discourse that offers no political legitimacy to women located, or proclaiming knowledge, outside of the defined norms, and respects only those who reify existing traditions".<ref target="BAWE_0137n-ftnote.020"/> </s>

<s n="s3.5;p17.44">This is epitomised in Sri Lanka, when Tamil women fleeing conflict realised that the "spatial exigencies of camp life produced an erosion of the caste hierarchies"<ref target="BAWE_0137n-ftnote.025"/> which ironically empowered them to assume men's former tasks and gain a degree of economic and political independence. </s>

<p n="p39.44">
<s n="s1.4;p39.44">The fundamental concept of "empowerment" is dealt with in the first part of the essay. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p39.44">Essentially, ethnic conflict discourses have often attributed full agency to men while women have been relegated to being a passive recipient. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p39.44">To counter this traditional and gendered notion of victimhood, the essay has pushed forth arguments for women's empowerment in ethnic conflicts based on empirical evidences obtained from the Rwandan, Yugoslavian and Sri Lankan case studies. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p39.44">By first understanding the basis of the victimhood discourse, academic scholarship should transcend that by taking a step further to examine how women often play a greater role than presumed - as mothers of the nation, combatants for the nation, perpetrators against the nation and peacemakers to rebuild the nation. </s>
</p>
<p n="p40.44">
<s n="s1.5;p40.44">Upon establishing women's empowerment in ethnic conflicts, the second part of the essay then addresses the "ambivalent" nature of this empowerment during and after conflicts. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p40.44">It has been firmly established that women may be empowered symbolically rather than realistically. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p40.44">After all, they may be conscious agents acting out of their own will, albeit being actors framed within a patriarchal system inevitably. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p40.44">From another perspective, empowerment is a contextualised notion; specific political, economic and socio-cultural conditions may give rise to experiences of empowerment which may be transitory and elusive. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p40.44">Hence women, like men, are capable of being empowered in ethnic conflicts which open up new opportunities and spaces for new roles and responsibilities yet the extent of empowerment often varies according to circumstances. </s>
</p>
<p n="p41.44">
<s n="s1.2;p41.44">Stringing the above core ideas together, Darini Rajasingham-Senanayake's phrase 'ambivalent empowerment'<ref target="BAWE_0137n-ftnote.077"/> seems to fit best when we critically analyse women's agency beyond victimhood in ethnic conflicts. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p41.44">This conclusion brings about two main implications which impact gender studies generally and women's identity specifically. </s>

<p n="p42.44">
<s n="s1.5;p42.44">Firstly, the way and extent to which women may be empowered by their roles and experiences in ethnic conflicts has "theoretical and practical ramifications for gender sensitive analyses as well as for national or international feminist politics".<ref target="BAWE_0137n-ftnote.078"/> Most feminist human rights theorists and activists have often built their arguments for more equality and justice on the basis of gender discrimination and female victimhood. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p42.44">This illuminates a broader conundrum for feminists: "how do they address women's human rights if in so 'doing', they rectify certain (unhelpful, incomplete, potentially essentialist) constructs that they also wish to - or need to - annihilate?" </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0137n-ftnote.079"/>
<s n="s3.5;p42.44">After all, most of the existing international mechanisms for addressing wartime sexual violence also tend to "reify the male-perpetrator/female victim paradigm". </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0137n-ftnote.080"/>
<s n="s4.5;p42.44">For many feminists who are committed to peace, the notion of female perpetrators becomes an anomaly in their studies, indirectly affirming the perception that women are almost always conceived as victims and nothing more. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p42.44">On this note, there should definitely be more awareness for women's rights in conflicts but we should not overplay women's victimhood in wars which would ironically chain us to the gender norms that we aspire to be liberated from. </s>

<s n="s2.2;p44.44">Above all, this symbolic transcendence of victimhood will only be a true socio-cultural transformation when external patriarchal structures are eradicated in conjunction with the development of an internal process of consciousness within the minds of people; creating a universal language that will legitimate women's empowerment in midst of conflicts, furthermore providing women with a sense of their own agency </s>
