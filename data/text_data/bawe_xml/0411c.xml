<p n="p1.36">
<s n="s1.2;p1.36">Traditionally the right to silence has been known as one of the fundamental pillars of the legal system, working alongside the presumption of innocence and the burden of proof to protect suspects' rights within the criminal justice system. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p1.36">However reforms to the law have sought to alter this principle to the extent that the question has to be asked whether the right to silence still exists within the modern English legal system. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p2.36">To place the question within its context, I shall briefly explain what the right to silence is; its origins and history and its place within the legal system. </s>

<s n="s4.6;p2.36">In order to answer this I shall begin by examining the impact of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1984 and the subsequent case law<ref target="BAWE_0411c-ftnote.001"/> upon the practice of law. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p2.36">I have also conducted interviews with both a police officer and a criminal solicitor and hope to use this evidence to provide an insight into the practical use of the right to silence within the trial process. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p2.36">In doing so I hope to analyse its impact both pre-trial and within court and discover whether the right to silence still remains albeit in a modern altered form<ref target="BAWE_0411c-ftnote.002"/>, or whether it has been removed through reform and merely exists in name only, as a shadow of its former self. <ref target="BAWE_0411c-ftnote.003"/> </s>

<s n="s1.5;p33.36">I have chosen to write my essay on the right to silence as I have found it one of the most engaging and curious topics throughout the module. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p33.36">Prior to having studied the topic, it was my understanding that the traditional interpretation of the right to silence remained intact, however in reality it seems that this is far from the truth. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p33.36">In my opinion this seems to be an exorbitant erosion of one of the fundamental principles and protections of English law and thus this is my motivation for choosing it as the topic for my essay. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p33.36">The exact title of the essay arises from the fact that my opinion on the merits of the right to silence are very straightforward, that I believe in its importance and merits within the legal system. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p33.36">As such the essay title and thus essay, focuses both on whether the right to silence should exist and significantly whether it still does within the modern legal system. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p34.36">The starting point of my research was as always my lecture notes and textbook<ref target="BAWE_0411c-ftnote.061"/>. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p34.36">Traditionally this is often the point from which I begin an essay as it gives me the basic areas with which to cover and points me in the direction of further areas of study. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p34.36">My second point of research is along the same lines, that I like to consult another textbook, simply to consolidate my earlier research and again to point me in the direction of further ideas. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p34.36">For this purpose I looked at Roberts and Zuckerman's Criminal Evidence<ref target="BAWE_0411c-ftnote.062"/> as it's a book I've consulted previously during ALS and other modules and is very good analytical text. </s>

<s n="s2.4;p36.36">I chose to leave the interviews until last as I wanted to be certain of my subject material and specific questions I could ask, rather than simply asking general questions which would be of little benefit. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p36.36">I conducted the interviews by telephone and created a list of questions I wanted answering prior to calling. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p36.36">I asked questions as to the use and implementation of the right to silence and I specifically asked whether they were in favour of the right to silence and whether they believed it still existed. </s>
