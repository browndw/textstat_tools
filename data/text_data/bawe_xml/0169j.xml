<head rend="bold italic">1. Organisation Survey</head>
<p n="p5.29">
<s n="s1.2;p5.29">A questionnaire was delivered to the manager of the restaurant to capture organisational information (e.g. turnover, most popular dish) and their perception of the quality of the service delivered. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p5.29">The survey was conducted using a combination of open ended questions and on a Likert Scale for more quantitative analysis. </s>

<head rend="bold italic">2. Customer Survey</head>
<p n="p6.29">
<s n="s1.4;p6.29">Twenty five customers were asked their opinion on seven aspects of the restaurant using a scale ranging from very poor to very good. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p6.29">They were also asked how important they thought the factors were towards the service quality offered by Oriental Star. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p6.29">Information was also collected about how many times they visit the restaurant, whether they had made a complaint and some basic demographic information. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p6.29">For avoidance of doubt, service quality was defined for participants as "the overall quality of the service offered by Oriental Star". </s>

<s n="s2.5;p7.29">It combines five key stages to assess the customers experience as they flow through the service process. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p7.29">For example a mystery shopper may walk through the process and assess each transaction describing it as delighting (+), satisfactory (0) or unsatisfactory (-). </s>

<s n="s1.6;p8.29">In most businesses but especially service industries the customer is king. </s>

<s n="s3.6;p8.29">The business should first aim to meet customer expectations, and eventually to exceed expectations. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p8.29">Along this progress, careful management of expectations is required to ensure that the gap between expectations and delivery is minimised. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p8.29">Delivering an excellent service comes through doing what you promise and dealing well with the unexpected. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p8.29">The integration of front and back office operations is also important as "Effective service delivery requires the co-ordination of front- and back- office operations."<ref target="BAWE_0169j-ftnote.007"/> </s>

</note>
<p n="p9.29">
<s n="s1.5;p9.29">Underpinning service quality is a consideration of the operation as a whole, and thus the entire outcome and experience of the customer is service quality. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p9.29">The relationship between expectations and perceptions goes a long way to explain the level of service quality. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p9.29">Perception is crucial to understanding as the reality of the service delivered by an organisation is of that perceived by the customer. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p9.29">Each customer may perceive a situation differently due to their personal and emotional circumstances. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p9.29">For example a customer already in a bad mood will be less inclined to tolerate a wait in a restaurant, than one who is in a pleasant mood. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.29">
<s n="s1.8;p10.29">To ascertain the service quality for Oriental Star both the internal view and the external view should be examined. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p10.29">From conversations with the manager it is clear that an "excellent service" combined with "authentic" food are the foundations of the service. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p10.29">Appendix 1 shows that the manager rated the service offered, the quality of service from staff and the quality of food offered as very good, the highest possible rating. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p10.29">Using the 18 quality factors model (Johnston 1995b and Silvestro and Johnston 1990) and feedback from the Oriental Star staff it is possible to capture the aspects of the service quality of Oriental Star. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p10.29">Attentiveness / helpfulness of the staff were stressed as important, particularly clearing empty plates and asking customers for drinks when appropriate. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p10.29">The manager also rated the layout of the restaurant as very good and said it was important that restaurant has a pleasant appearance and was kept tidy. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p10.29">Communication is also part of the service quality. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p10.29">As customers do not pay until they leave the restaurant it is important that the restaurant communicates the price of the buffet and its nature e.g. all you can eat. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.29">
<s n="s1.6;p11.29">By asking the manager how they coped at busy times and it is clear that flexibility is part of the service quality: "All the staff are fully qualified and good at their jobs, the only provisions we need is to rearrange the tables"<ref target="BAWE_0169j-ftnote.009"/>. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p11.29">He was keen to mention that they happily cater for large parties. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p11.29">Reliability, the consistency of performance applies particularly to the constant replenishment of dishes. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p11.29">The manager named Aromatic Crispy Duck as the best selling dish and thus particular attention was paid to ensure that this was constantly stocked. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p11.29">Finally responsiveness is part of the service quality offered by Oriental Star as it was stressed that customers should be able to receive their buffet food swiftly. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p11.29">This belief also underpins the restaurants desire to have a quick turnover of customers to maximise the turnover of the space available as it was indicated by the manager that he wished to have a larger restaurant. </s>

</p>
</note>
<p n="p12.29">
<s n="s1.2;p12.29">The service quality explained by the restaurant employees should be compared with the findings from customer responses as this may highlight any gaps in the perceived service of both parties. </s>

<p n="p13.29">
<s n="s1.9;p13.29">Figure 2 shows that the category rated with the highest mean value was price of the food compared to other restaurants. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p13.29">Appendix 2 shows that 84% of customers surveyed thought the price was good or very good. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p13.29">This also compares favourably with the importance rating given by customers to price (4.16 against an importance rating of 4.28). </s>
<s n="s4.9;p13.29">The factor which scored the lowest with customers was queuing time, which received a value of 2.8. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p13.29">However it appears that this factor is rated highly to the service quality delivered by Oriental Star with a rating of 3.8. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p13.29">Customers seem to think that queuing times contributes significantly to the service quality. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p13.29">Some customers also said that value for money depended on how much they had consumed. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p13.29">Some customers indicated that if they had only consumed 1 plate of Chinese that they would not consider this value for money. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p13.29">The general opinion was that 2-3 plates represented value for money. </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.29">
<s n="s1.4;p14.29">All the factors were rated higher for importance to the service quality delivered, than the actual standard. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p14.29">From the sample of 25 this may indicate that there is a gap between the actual rating of factors contributing to the service quality and how important they are perceived by the customers. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p14.29">For example overall service provided by Oriental Star was given a mean rating of 3.5 out of 5, but the perceived importance to service quality was 4.1. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p14.29">There is a further gap between these customer ratings and that given by the manager who rated the service offered as 5/5. </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.29">
<s n="s1.9;p15.29">This gap analysis highlights the areas where there is a difference between the actual standard delivered and the standard desired by customers. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p15.29">This analysis is important for many reasons. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p15.29">Firstly it can help concentrate efforts to close the gap on factors where the importance to service quality is higher than the actual rating. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p15.29">Also in areas where the gap is minimal or zero the management might be able to focus less on this factor. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p15.29">Finally in areas where performance may be higher (although not applicable to these results) than the importance to the service quality it shows management that they would be better off focusing efforts elsewhere. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p15.29">Analysing the gap between the standard that the manager thinks the restaurant is offering and the standard rated by the customers provides interesting findings. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p15.29">For all the same factors the manager has rated them higher than the mean rating of the 25 customers. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p15.29">This indicates that the manager believes that they are delivering a service quality of a higher level than customers believe. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p15.29">This is a significant area for improvement, as not fully understanding customers may have a detrimental effect on sales. </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.29">
<s n="s1.4;p16.29">Grouping the factors of the service quality into four groups provides further insight. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p16.29">These groups are defined in terms of a factor's ability to dissatisfy and delight<ref target="BAWE_0169j-ftnote.010"/>. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p16.29">This is a useful technique because it facilitates the identification of factor's that may merit improvement, and contribute to a higher level of service quality. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p20.29">The main issue from the analysis of the service quality offered by Oriental Star is the gap between how the manager rates the service offered and how customers rate it. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p22.29">Presently all dishes are placed in the same area and customers form a linear queue. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p22.29">This means that at some times dishes aren't being accessed at the front of the area while the queue increases at the back. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p22.29">As queuing has been seen to affect the service quality reducing the length of time would improve the service quality delivered by Oriental Star. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p22.29">If the layout was redesigned by simply splitting main dishes from smaller dishes (e.g. salads, crispy aromatic duck) customers would be able to form two smaller queues and access different dishes at different times. </s>

<s n="s2.7;p23.29">By considering the ten principles of waiting the restaurant can adopt simple techniques to better manage queuing when they occur. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p23.29">More uncertain waits seem longer than finite waits so the management should communicate to customers how long estimated waiting times are for tables. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p23.29">This can be done through posters or through staff. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p23.29">The restaurant should also clearly explain to customers why they are queuing either for a table or for food, as unexplained waits seem longer. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p23.29">Finally the management should ensure that queues are fair (e.g. no pushing in, stealing waiting customers' tables). </s>
<s n="s7.7;p23.29">This should all help to raise the service quality delivered to customers. </s>

<s n="s3.8;p24.29">To combat this problem the restaurant should introduce a fixed plate's policy through which customers could pay a reduced price for just one plate. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p26.29">Capturing the views of an organisation is a crucial first step to understanding the motives for the level of service delivered. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p26.29">It is useful to compare how an organisation thinks it is performing against how customers actually feel the service is performing. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p26.29">From this perspective the Oriental Star Questionnaire was a useful exercise. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p26.29">It helped define the service concept of the organisation and provide insight into what the manager thought was Oriental Stars strengths and weaknesses. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p26.29">However it is limited in that there is likely to be bias in the answers given by the manager to reflect positively on the company. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p26.29">This is highlighted by the fact that the manager gave the quality of the food a value of 5, whereas the mean value rated by customers was 3.56. </s>
</p>
<p n="p27.29">
<s n="s1.13;p27.29">Careful consideration must be applied when deciding upon the appropriate number of questions to ask customers. </s>
<s n="s2.13;p27.29">It may be preferred to have many questions, to gain a detailed understanding of customer views but long questionnaires usually result in poor returns. </s>
<s n="s3.13;p27.29">Although it is relatively easy to ask customers their opinion on particular aspects of the service it is harder to understand more subtle nuances such as will customers return again, or use word of mouth to inform potential customers. </s>
<s n="s4.13;p27.29">There are also issues with the nature of the data collective, most pertinently qualitative versus quantitative data. </s>
<s n="s5.13;p27.29">Although the scores received on a scale of 1-5 were useful for assessing satisfaction, it gives no indication of why those scores were given, or what changes could be made to improve. </s>
<s n="s6.13;p27.29">Academic studies also suggest that "a lot of customer satisfaction assessment is a waste of time and effort"<ref target="BAWE_0169j-ftnote.016"/>. </s>
<s n="s7.13;p27.29">On a larger more comprehensive scale, customer satisfaction assessment can consume a lot of company resources in the collecting and analysing data and producing extensive company reports. </s>
<s n="s8.13;p27.29">Further, it should be asked whether satisfied customers guarantee success. </s>
<s n="s9.13;p27.29">There are two aspects here. </s>
<s n="s10.13;p27.29">Firstly the reliability of the data, whether people take due care when giving their answers or just want to get the questionnaire over and one with. </s>
<s n="s11.13;p27.29">Secondly if customers indicate that they are satisfied, does this mean that the company will achieve success? </s>
<s n="s12.13;p27.29">In highly competitive markets customers that become slightly dissatisfied may easily switch or not use the service again. </s>
<s n="s13.13;p27.29">Thus a satisfied customer now, may not always use the service / products in the future. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p29.29">The 18 Service Quality factors model is useful as it covers fundamental competencies for any business but it is not specific for the individual business needs of Oriental Star to increase the service quality it delivers and therefore improve customer satisfaction. </s>
