<p n="p1.18">
<s n="s1.5;p1.18">The Hunger Strikes in 1981 represented a 'watershed' in the both Republican history and that of Northern Ireland. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p1.18">In many ways it was not the strike itself that generated developments but the media frenzy surrounding the episode. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p1.18">The publicity and widespread sympathy among republicans for those on hunger strike in Long Kesh/Maze prison shook Sinn Fein leadership into taking a more political stance. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p1.18">The episode the threatened political stability of the entire country and urgently required both the British and Republicans to identify their objectives. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p1.18">As a result Sinn Fein realised the potential of a political strategy and made the significant decision to participate in elections. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.18">
<s n="s1.7;p2.18">A major impact of the hunger strike was the sizable increase in electoral support which Sinn Fein and by association, the IRA gained. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p2.18">In what Tonge describes as the 'electorally barren'<ref target="BAWE_0391c-ftnote.001"/> Irish Republic, sections of the Northern Irish population who had previously abstained from elections were politicised. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p2.18">Young militant activists from Republican ghettos in particular, were mobilised to vote for the first time. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p2.18">Internment and Bloody Sunday had started this process but the emotions, which accompanied the hunger strikes, the symbolic significance of Bobby Sands, in particular, demonstrated how voters were ready to express their armed struggle through the ballot box. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p2.18">For many nationalists the alternative option of supporting the British government was an impossible one, hence the surge in electoral support for the republicans and Sinn Fein. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p2.18">The 1982 elections revealed that approximately one-third of Catholics in the North supported Sinn Fein<ref target="BAWE_0391c-ftnote.002"/> and, according to Tonge by logical conclusion, sympathised with the IRA's armed struggle.<ref target="BAWE_0391c-ftnote.003"/> Results in 1983 followed a similar pattern when Sinn Fein reached their electoral peak at Westminster with 13.4% of the vote.<ref target="BAWE_0391c-ftnote.004"/> The SDLP was not, however, successfully dislodged from its dominant position and it is unclear how many voters actually supported the entire Sinn Fein's programme. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p2.18">The party though, hereafter, had the luxury of not only a larger pool of recruits but also the satisfaction of political credibility. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p3.18">The hunger strikes had a key influence on Sinn Fein's Republican agenda. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p3.18">Prior to the hunger strikes, Sinn Fein was a relatively meagre political force in comparison to the SDLP, which could boast support from the majority of republicans. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p3.18">The population was also tired of the IRA's excessive violence and had weakened its active backing. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p3.18">However, as early as 1975 Sinn Fein had made the declaration to 'build up the party, we need a voice, we need to be very clear about what are the demands and what are the aims and objectives of the struggle." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0391c-ftnote.005"/>
<s n="s5.6;p3.18">The struggle in the prisons certainly set this objective in motion. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p3.18">As English has commented, 'It would be wrong to see 1981 as <hi rend="italic">beginning</hi> the process of republican politicisation: it would more accurately be understood as an unintended <hi rend="italic">accelerator</hi> of a process already favoured by the leaders of the movement.'<ref target="BAWE_0391c-ftnote.006"/> </s>

<s n="s1.6;p4.18">Whilst this change in Sinn Fein's agenda was in development, however, the main catalyst for action was the vacancy at Westminster following the sudden death of Frank Maguire MP. The subsequent manoeuvre by Sinn Fein to place Bobby Sands for MP revealed the level of grass roots support for the hunger strikers and their party representatives. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p4.18">Prior to this decision, the British government had a reasonable case to refuse the granting of political status to IRA prisoners. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p4.18">As Danny Morrison later reflected, the Republicans had a long suspicion of party politics - 'politics equals compromise." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0391c-ftnote.007"/>

<s n="s6.6;p4.18">By obtaining the seat in 1981, the political atmosphere had demonstrated the potential for republican politics if extended to a broader audience. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p5.18">Rather than the hunger strike itself, therefore, it was the election of Bobby Sands to Westminster, which stood as the catalyst for change. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p5.18">Sands' victory shifted the Republican movement into the realm of party politics. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p5.18">Terrorist activities would no longer be the sole focus for Republican strategy; hereafter it was 'the bomb and ballot box.' </s>
<s n="s4.4;p5.18">To quote Sands the strikes 'broadened the battlefields'<ref target="BAWE_0391c-ftnote.009"/> of the republican movement - Sinn Fein evolved as a substantial political force. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p6.18">This increased Republican awareness in the potential of party politics is evident in both the rhetoric and actions of post-strike Sinn Fein. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p6.18">In 1983 Gerry Adams, who in these crucial years had risen to prominence, was elected president of Sinn Fein. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p6.18">He began talking of developing the movement's 'potential' and of the need 'to move into the mainstream of political relevancy,' break down self-isolation' and crack the 'compartmentalised attitudes'<ref target="BAWE_0391c-ftnote.010"/> of many Republicans. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p6.18">According to Campbell, one of the hunger strikers, 'it afforded us room to manoeuvre, to recognise and to plan for further action in pursuit of our objectives." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0391c-ftnote.011"/>
<s n="s5.6;p6.18">By 1985 Sinn Fein candidates took their seats at local councils and by 1986 the abstentionist stand in the Dublin parliament was dropped. </s>

</note>
<p n="p7.18">
<s n="s1.7;p7.18">Whilst the political impact surrounding the hunger strikes represented a departure from traditional Republican policy, the technique of going on hunger strike had deep roots in Irish culture. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p7.18">'To do yourself to death'<ref target="BAWE_0391c-ftnote.012"/> had been a method of obtaining political recognition in 1916 and 1923 and more recently in 1972. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p7.18">The strikers were no doubt aware of the religious and cultural associations of their self-sacrifice. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p7.18">Sands et al. therefore effectively built on the prominent mythology of martyrdom in Irish political history. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p7.18">In this key way the hunger strikes stood to preserve rather than change aspects of Northern Ireland's politics. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p7.18">According to O'Malley and others, the strikers were 'victims of our myths." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0391c-ftnote.013"/>

<s n="s5.5;p8.18">In 1978 Brigadier J.M. Glover commented that 'our evidence of the calibre of rank and file terrorists does not support the view that they are merely mindless hooligans drawn from the unemployed and unemployable.' <ref target="BAWE_0391c-ftnote.016"/> </s>

<s n="s1.8;p9.18">This correlation between public sympathy and electoral success would have significant implications for the marketing of Northern Irish politics. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p9.18">In effect, the hunger strikes represented a 'propaganda battle'<ref target="BAWE_0391c-ftnote.017"/> between the British government and the republican movement. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p9.18">In this dispute there can be little doubt as to the winner. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p9.18">As Dixon states, whilst the British 'won the contest of wills'<ref target="BAWE_0391c-ftnote.018"/> with the prisoners over political status they 'lost the propaganda war, resuscitated an ailing IRA and politicised militant Republicanism." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0391c-ftnote.019"/>
<s n="s5.8;p9.18">Publicity would have increasing significance in later years as the Republicans saw the potential to capitalise on an age of television and mass media. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p9.18">Both the British government and the Army isolated propaganda as the 'enemy's most powerful weapon; and the most difficult to counter." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0391c-ftnote.020"/>
<s n="s7.8;p9.18">Unsurprisingly therefore Sands called for an 'army of propagandists to put their views across' in order to 'stir people's emotions, to arise...and activate them'<ref target="BAWE_0391c-ftnote.021"/>-'we must create our own mass media." </s>
