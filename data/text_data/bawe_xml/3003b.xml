<s n="s1.11;p1.16">Michel Foucault's<ref target="BAWE_3003b-ftnote.001"/> essay 'What is an Author?' has had a massive impact upon how people view the idea of authorship and authority. </s>
<s n="s2.11;p1.16">Foucault claimed that the traditional view of the author was simply a modern construction seeking to exalt the author to an omniscient position. </s>
<s n="s3.11;p1.16">However, he felt that in reality the author has no authority over their text, as the reader cannot know the author and therefore cannot interpret the author's intentions. </s>
<s n="s4.11;p1.16">Moreover, he felt it was unnecessary to know the author's intention; what was more important was for the reader to be able to bring their own meaning and interpretation from the text for their own use. </s>
<s n="s5.11;p1.16">Other Postmodern thinkers have taken this idea further, treating the world as a text and the individuals habiting the world as the readers. </s>
<s n="s6.11;p1.16">The individual has no clear authority or standards by which to interpret the world and is consequently left to discover 'truth' for themselves, and to live in a way which best serves themselves and their needs. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p1.16">Sigmund Freud<ref target="BAWE_3003b-ftnote.002"/> thought that in view of death, the central motivation for the individual in life was the feeling of desire and pleasure. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p1.16">In addition, Jacques Lacan<ref target="BAWE_3003b-ftnote.003"/> said that at the core of human identity is a sense of lack, knowledge that we will never be fulfilled, therefore desire is not the product of the search but the point of it; the individual desires desire. </s>
<s n="s9.11;p1.16">The Modern subject, in light of the death of God and religion, searched for reason and truth, believing they could be found in science, philosophy and in the benevolence of mankind. </s>
<s n="s10.11;p1.16">The Postmodern individual, unconvinced by the reality of altruistic humanism, became fluid, hybrid and fragmented. </s>
<s n="s11.11;p1.16">At the heart of Postmodern subjectivity is the need to define oneself against the 'other'; the need to find self fulfilment and realisation. </s>
