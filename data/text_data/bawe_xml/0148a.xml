<epigraph>
<p>"In cases where the issue is litigated, it seems likely that one party intended a legal agreement and the other wanted the agreement to be merely morally binding. This contradiction removes any possibility of justifying the limits of contracts on the basis of the joint intent of the parties. We are forced to the conclusion that the courts must rely on hidden policy considerations when determining the intentions of the parties" [Collins, H (2003) <hi rend="italic">The Law of Contract</hi> pp.104-105]</p>

<s n="s1.5;p9.9">In conclusion, the courts rely on hidden policy considerations to help them establish the presence of intention to create legal relations. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p9.9">These hidden policy considerations are the behaviour of the parties and context of the agreement. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p9.9">Where intent is not expressly stated the courts take an objective approach, considering all the factors of the agreement. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p9.9">The context of the agreement is the most powerful influence on the court's decision, but other considerations can be taken in to account to rebut the initial presumption. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p9.9">I therefore agree with Collins that the most appropriate way for the courts to establish intention is studying the wider scope of the agreement. </s>
