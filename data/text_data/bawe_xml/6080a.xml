<s n="s3.4;p8.26">As an example, in developed countries, an export subsidy is given in order to protect their producers in the international market from the competition of other countries, poorer countries, where the cost of factors of production, such as labour or land, is much cheaper and as a consequence, also the final price of the good will be lower. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p9.26">In order to understand how a subsidy works effectively, we have to analyse its effects on RD and RS curves. </s>
