<s n="s3.9;p1.34">He used his theories of epic theatre to achieve this, indirect contradiction to the prevailing genre of naturalism. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p1.34">Brecht suggested that before his day theatre audiences were passive, hypnotised by the performance, ready to accept whatever was said by the actor as the truth. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p1.34">In his epic form he proposed a theatre which would not be 'dramatic', full of tensions and conflicts, but slower-paced, giving time to reflect and compare. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p1.34">Perhaps his greatest challenge was to create a theatre which would arouse the spectators' interest, even before the arousal of his capacity for action was considered. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p1.34">The interest of audiences past left much to be desired. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p1.34">In the eighteenth century many theatres provided curtains for the boxes, inside which the actresses could provide better entertainment than they ever could on the stage. </s>

<s n="s7.8;p2.34">A difficult figure to study in terms of his commitment and fluctuating beliefs, it is important to note the developments and changes in the work of a man who, whilst leaving the total dedication to Marx to others, endeavoured to create theatre in which 'instruction and entertainment conflict openly.' </s>
<s n="s8.8;p2.34">Challenging the dream world of Dramatic theatre, his theatre would pose problems and, far from solving them, was designed to leave the spectator with a task to be accomplished in the real world, hopefully gaining the interest of even those who found 'nothing on earth more difficult and more impenetrable than politics.'<ref target="BAWE_0024g-ftnote.002"/> </s>
