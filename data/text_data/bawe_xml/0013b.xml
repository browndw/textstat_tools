<s n="s3.11;p1.27">The Italian Renaissance is generally associated with the fifteenth century. </s>
<s n="s4.11;p1.27">This period, however, can be stretched in either direction. </s>
<s n="s5.11;p1.27">For example, the term "Renaissance" has been used to describe some thirteenth-century artists, and the great artists of the Renaissance were active until the end of the sixteenth century. </s>
<s n="s6.11;p1.27">The rebirth of the visual arts was one aspect of the Renaissance but the development of humanism and the classical studies of the universities were as important. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p1.27">There were also advancements in music, literature, science and government practices during this period. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p1.27">How far Florence was responsible for these developments can be debated. </s>
<s n="s9.11;p1.27">Robert Black asserts that 'the elitism of Florentine society and the monopoly which the Florentine patriciate had over classical culture made Florence the first and greatest capital of the Renaissance'<ref target="BAWE_0013b-ftnote.001"/>. </s>
<s n="s10.11;p1.27">Jocelyn Hunt, on the other hand, believes that 'the assumption that Florence was pre-eminent is... </s>

<s n="s1.10;p2.27">Burckhardt identified Florence as the 'cradle of the Renaissance'<ref target="BAWE_0013b-ftnote.003"/>. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p2.27">It appears as though 'the components for a successful intellectual movement were all to be found in Florence at the start of the fifteenth century'<ref target="BAWE_0013b-ftnote.004"/>. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p2.27">The city was wealthy, banking was highly developed, and papal revenues were often invested in Florence rather than the volatile and dangerous city of Rome. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p2.27">Florence had a high population. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p2.27">It was active in manufacture, trade and commerce. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p2.27">Textile production and metalworking were successful industries in Florence. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p2.27">The city was in a prime position for trade; it was close enough to the coast for sea trade but far enough to keep it safe from pirate attacks. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p2.27">It was also able to trade over the Alps and was close to the Middle East so merchants could bring back the luxury goods available there, such as silk and spices. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p2.27">Florence was primarily a city orientated towards craft-industrial production rather than trade like Venice. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p2.27">This appears to have been a more favourable environment for artists to be produced as 'it was only when Venice turned from trade to industry, at the end of the fifteenth century, that Venetian art caught up with that of Florence'<ref target="BAWE_0013b-ftnote.005"/>. </s>

<s n="s4.7;p3.27">Gene A. Brucker notes that ' this appreciation of quality, and a corresponding disdain for the shoddy and inferior, became a characteristic feature of the Florentine mentality'<ref target="BAWE_0013b-ftnote.007"/>. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p3.27">Secondly, as Gregorio Dati, a contemporary Florentine, explains, 'Florence is situated in a naturally wild and sterile place'<ref target="BAWE_0013b-ftnote.008"/>, so that the people had to work hard, using their intelligence in order to live comfortably. </s>
