<s n="s4.6;p1.21">And with the other one, it was done in two different conditions, one was putting load on a lever arm at 200mm from the shaft centre, and then change in height was measured, the other one just made the load 100mm less from the shaft centre. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p1.21">And the load was increased in steps of 0.2kg, data was recorded as well. </s>
