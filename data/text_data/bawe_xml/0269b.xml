<p n="p19.34">
<s n="s1.2;p19.34">Downs' assumptions indicate that in order to achieve electoral success, a party must move to the centre of the distribution of preferences where, owing to the unimodal structure, the majority of voters reside. </s>

</p>
<p n="p20.34">
<s n="s1.4;p20.34">This approach undoubtedly worked for New Labour in the General Election of 1997; by reaching out to the <hi rend="italic">Worcester Woman</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Mondeo Man</hi>, the apparent median voters, the election was won with a 10% swing from the Conservatives, double that of the previous highest. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p26.34">When analysing individual issues, Labour was ahead on the two most important issues. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p26.34">In a MORI survey<ref target="BAWE_0269b-ftnote.009"/> 9, 67% of those polled indicated that health care was an important issue in the 2005 election and 36% suggested that Labour's policies were most in line with their preferences, whereas only 22% thought the Conservative Party would best manage health care and 10% trusted the Liberal Democrats. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p26.34">The issue of Education, second in the list of most important issues, also indicated electorate trust in Labour, where 35% stated they had the best policies in that area, over 20% for the Conservatives and 10% for the Liberal Democrats. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p26.34">Only on less important issues such as Immigration and Iraq did the Conservatives and Liberals make any ground. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p27.34">On the most important issues, Labour certainly appealed to the median voter and though the Conservatives' immigration policy appealed to many, the issue was clearly not high enough in the voters' preference list to greatly affect the result of the election. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p27.34">It is a known fact that when the economy is doing well, as it was at the time of the 2005 General Election, immigration is not a great concern; the fact that 53% of those surveyed trusted Labour's economic policy perhaps alleviated the impact of the popular Conservative immigration policy. </s>
</p>
<p n="p28.34">
<s n="s1.3;p28.34">It became apparent shortly after the party campaigns began that Labour would attempt to highlight the success of the economy under their time in government whereas the Conservative Party would advocate their immigration policy whenever possible. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p28.34">However, the controversial nature of the issue ensured that the Conservatives were quickly labelled "The Nasty Party" by their opponents and, whilst consolidating their core vote, disengaged a lot of people in the process. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p28.34">In contrast, Labour's economic platform was successful in that they had an 8 year history of being capable managers of the economy, something that the Conservative party lost in the ERM crisis of 1992 and are still trying to regain. </s>
</p>
<p n="p29.34">
<s n="s1.4;p29.34">Downs' median voter theorem implies that the most important factor in determining the electoral result is party policies and the degree to which they are aligned with that of the voter. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p29.34">However, there are other factors that affect the way people vote. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p29.34">When a MORI poll asked "what it is that most attracted you to the [insert party name] party", 31% of those surveyed stated that 'Leader Image' was the most important deciding factor and 24% 'Party Image'. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p29.34">Though the rest agreed that "Issues" was the most important factor, this evidence illustrates that Downs' theorem is limited by the extent to which the electorate vote on issues alone. </s>
</p>
<p n="p30.34">
<s n="s1.5;p30.34">Another limitation to the use of Downs' model of voting is the rise of the Liberal Democrats as a viable third party. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p30.34">The model is less effective in multi-party systems; by gaining 22% of the electorate (up 3.8% from 2001) and 62 seats, the Liberals are finally showing that, despite the biased electoral system, the rise of a three party system in the United Kingdom is not completely out of the question. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p30.34">This would add another dimension to the Downs' model of voting and it has yet to be seen whether the theorem can withstand such a development. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p30.34">It is clear that smaller third parties, such as the Green Party and the British National Party, would not win election by adopting median policies; in some cases, it is not even in the party's interest to win the general election but rather to stand on a single issue in a single constituency as more of a protest to the actions of the government. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p30.34">The Respect Party in particular, where the election of George Galloway in Bethnal Green and Bow on an anti-Iraq-war ticket, demonstrated that Downs' assumption, that the single goal of election is pursued rationally by the political party, is in fact not consistently true. </s>
</p>
<p n="p31.34">
<s n="s1.4;p31.34">Another assumption made by Downs can be contested. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p31.34">The view that voters' preferences are fixed was perhaps not the case in the General Election of 1979. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p31.34">The Conservative candidate Margaret Thatcher's revolutionary policies of privatisation and restructuring were not at the time shared by the electorate but through careful campaigning and electorate education, Thatcher managed to realign the entire contemporary political ideology and thus undermine a fundamental principle of Downs' theorem. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p31.34">However, when regarding the 2005 General Election, it appeared that no politician was ready to take such bold action and it was only in the aftermath that the Tories, whilst returning to opposition, decided to modernise in an attempt to move closer to the ideological centre by electing a new leader. </s>
</p>
<p n="p32.34">
<s n="s1.4;p32.34">This tactic certainly worked for New Labour in 1997, when Tony Blair fronted a revamped party that 're-wrote Clause IV, promised to abide by Conservative trade union legislation, abandoned its outright opposition to grammar schools, committed itself to the 'golden rule' and the Conservative government's spending plans and pledged to leave income tax unchanged." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0269b-ftnote.010"/>
<s n="s2.4;p32.34">This move to the centre right of British Politics was, in the opinion of authors such as Pippa Norris<ref target="BAWE_0269b-ftnote.011"/>, an attempt to capture the median voter. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p32.34">This came as a harsh blow to party activists such as Tony Benn who saw the shift more as a sacrilege of traditional Labour values than an attempt to compromise. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p32.34">It seemed that at the time, the efforts made to woo the electorate since 1979 had been abandoned and Labour had fully accepted the Downs model. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p33.34">The Downs model has become increasingly popular owing not only to its contemporary ability but also because of the decline of viable alternative models. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p33.34">The sociological model is dependent on class and there has been, since the decline of manufacturing industries, a substantial fall in party links with classes, as well as there being a general decrease in the class system itself. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p33.34">For instance, the disaffiliation of the working class from the Labour Party has resulted in the traditional core Labour voter no longer identifying with New Labour's right-wing policies. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p33.34">The Psychological model has also become anachronistic since the recent fall in party identification, resulting in a more fluid electorate who seek to maximise their utility over committing to a party ideology. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p33.34">The economic model of voting has thus become more prevalent in recent years when concerning General Elections. </s>
</p>
<p n="p34.34">
<s n="s1.8;p34.34">Downs' model of voting has been, to some extent, accurate since its formulation in 1957. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p34.34">The extent to which it can help to explain the result of the British General Election of 2005 depends on the level of detail that one seeks to acquire. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p34.34">In the pre-election polls, Labour seemed ahead in regards to health care and education, the two most important policy areas. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p34.34">Also, the overall ideological position of the party was closest to that of the median voter. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p34.34">Therefore, when looking at the major parties' policies and ideologies, the Downs' model can be applied and should produce similar results to those seen in the General Election. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p34.34">However, there are a number of flaws in Downs' theorem such as its inability to accommodate for factors other than "issues" such as events, personality and whether the party leader has the ability to change individuals' preferences to the extent of provoking an ideological shift. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p34.34">This is becoming more prevalent with New Labour's use of Spin Doctors such as Alistair Campbell who seek to advocate policies that may not be in line with the median voter. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p34.34">Yet Downs' deterministic theory survives <hi rend="italic">due</hi> to its lack of variables and can therefore unintentionally accommodate for such factors by not considering them when formulating predictions. </s>
