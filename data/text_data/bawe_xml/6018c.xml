<s n="s1.3;p5.8">Promising as all of this may look we must consider the great limitations of the chimpanzee's abilities. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p5.8">None of the chimpanzees developed vocabularies anywhere near that of a human child. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p5.8">They seemed to be able to learn about a hundred words but then never progressed beyond this to learn thousands of words like human children can. </s>

<p n="p6.8">
<s n="s1.5;p6.8">There is an important point here, there is simply more to language than knowing a long list of words. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p6.8">Even knowledge of a thousand words would still be useless without the complex grammatical and syntactic systems we use. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p6.8">None of the chimps showed signs of getting to grips with either of these. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p6.8">Whereas Winthrop and Kellogg's son could understand the difference between "I saw what I mean" and "I mean what I say," Gua could neither differentiate between, nor understand either<ref target="BAWE_6018c-ftnote.004"/> for instance. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p6.8">Washoe who could understand the sign for "coke" could not differentiate between singular and plural forms and Nim filled her utterances with redundant words and had little syntactic structure. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p8.8">In conclusion I don't believe it can be seen that chimpanzees have language. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p8.8">Despite the fact they can be taught to use signs their vocabularies are greatly limited and their utterances rarely progress beyond the two word stage in meaning. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p8.8">They do not seem to be able to develop either the grammatical or syntactic systems that are vital to language both signed and spoken alike. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p8.8">Their language is also highly imitative in that the often just repeat signs made to them and they display little spontaneous signing. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p8.8">All in all, they lack true comprehension and so cannot differentiate between different forms, tenses etc of utterances. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p8.8">Although chimps can unarguably be taught signs for different things I believe they do not possess language. </s>
