<head rend="underlined">Section A - 1. Men's magazines</head>
<p n="p1.24">
<s n="s1.5;p1.24">Some of the oldest existing men's magazines are <hi rend="italic">Esquire, Arena</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Playboy</hi>, and <hi rend="italic"> FHM.</hi> </s>
<s n="s2.5;p1.24">Chris Astridge launched 'For Him Magazine' - formerly <hi rend="italic">For Him</hi> - in 1985. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p1.24">
<hi rend="italic">FHM</hi> is the most popular men's magazine in terms of current sales; from July to December 2005 it sold 500 865 copies (ABC). </s>
<s n="s4.5;p1.24">Although this is 13.6% less than the same period in 2004, <hi rend="italic">FHM</hi>'s sales are more than 20% of the total sales for the men's magazine market. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p1.24">The latest circulation figures for other monthly men's publications are less than half that of <hi rend="italic">FHM</hi> - 232 001 for <hi rend="italic">Loaded</hi> and 233 445 for <hi rend="italic">Men's Health</hi> (ABC Jul-Dec 05). </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.24">
<s n="s1.4;p2.24">The rise in popularity of men's magazines relates to men's lifestyle changes in the mid 1980s. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p2.24">In general men began to stay single for longer and had more disposable income. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p2.24">Publishers recognised a demand for men's lifestyle magazines, and many existing men's titles broadened their content. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p2.24">Initially <hi rend="italic">For Him</hi> focused on fashion, but it introduced a sports supplement in the early 1990s. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.24">
<s n="s1.9;p3.24">It is interesting that the 'male script' portrayed in men's magazines can be so different from one to another. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p3.24">This is largely related to the age of the target reader. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p3.24">At one end of the market is <hi rend="italic">Men's Health</hi>, designed to fill a niche for men in their thirties. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p3.24">The mean age of its readers is 31, compared to 27 for <hi rend="italic">Loaded</hi> and 24 for <hi rend="italic">Nuts</hi>. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p3.24">The idea of the magazine is to encourage men to reach their full potential in all areas of life. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p3.24">Its unexpected popularity reflects the recent change in the definition of masculinity. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p3.24">For example it is more common and acceptable for men to take responsibility for their health and appearance than thirty or forty years ago. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p3.24">But this might in fact be a consequence of the media rather than the media being a reflection of society. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p3.24">There is a similar problem regarding <hi rend="italic">Loaded</hi> and the rise of 'blokeish' or 'laddish' culture. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.24">
<s n="s1.5;p4.24">IPC Media launched <hi rend="italic">Loaded</hi> in 1994. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p4.24">It is often referred to as the first 'lad mag', because it marked a break from the earlier men's lifestyle magazines that focused on sophistication and style. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p4.24">In the first issue, the magazine's philosophy stated; "<hi rend="italic">Loaded</hi> is a magazine dedicated to life, liberty and the pursuit of sex, drink, football and less serious matters". </s>
<s n="s4.5;p4.24">The nature and content of such magazines reflected the emerging 'laddish culture' of the 1990s that could also be seen in television programmes like '<hi rend="italic">Men Behaving Badly'</hi> and <hi rend="italic">'They Think It's All Over'.</hi> </s>
<s n="s5.5;p4.24">The typical <hi rend="italic">Loaded</hi> reader is "younger, louder, and more hedonistic" than readers of men's magazines like <hi rend="italic">Arena</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Esquire</hi>. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.24">
<s n="s1.6;p5.24">Recently, the success of men's monthlies like <hi rend="italic">Loaded</hi> has prompted publishers to release more frequent publications. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p5.24">
<hi rend="italic">Nuts</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Zoo</hi> both started in 2004. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p5.24">They are similar in content, attitude and layout, although <hi rend="italic">Nuts</hi> is slightly ahead of <hi rend="italic">Zoo</hi> in terms of sales. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p5.24">In the last 6 months <hi rend="italic">Nuts</hi> sold 306 802 copies and <hi rend="italic">Zoo</hi> sold 260 470 (ABC Jul-Dec 05). </s>
<s n="s5.6;p5.24">Ultimately, men's magazines reflect conceptions of masculinity at the time, particularly those that are successful. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p5.24">Both <hi rend="italic">Nuts</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Zoo</hi> place emphasis on news, sport and girls in a "fast and funny style", to reflect the interests and lifestyles of men in their late teens and early 20s. </s>

<head rend="underlined">Section B - 2. Food and Drink</head>
<p n="p6.24">
<s n="s1.6;p6.24">Consumer magazines consist of both 'general' and 'specialist' titles. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p6.24">Food and drink magazines fall into the 'specialist' category; they are "for people with sharply defined hobbies and pursuits" (John Morrish, p13). </s>
<s n="s3.6;p6.24">Perhaps inevitably then, there is competition from general interest titles that include their own food and drink sections, such as <hi rend="italic">Good Housekeeping</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Prima</hi>. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p6.24">In addition most supermarkets publish a magazine, although these also contain other areas of interest besides food and drink. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p6.24">For example, <hi rend="italic">Sainsbury's: The Magazine</hi> classifies 50% of its content as 'lifestyle and features' and 50% as 'food and drink'. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p6.24">Supermarket magazines are rarely actively bought; <hi rend="italic">Tesco Magazine</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Asda Magazine</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Somerfield Magazine</hi> are all free to their customers. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.24">
<s n="s1.4;p7.24">This analysis will focus on magazines that are primarily about food and drink, and are paid for by the consumer. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p7.24">The most popular title in this category is <hi rend="italic">BBC Good Food</hi>, published monthly by BBC Magazines. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p7.24">From July to December 2005, <hi rend="italic">Good Food</hi> sold a total of 329 233 copies in the UK and Ireland (ABC). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p7.24">In comparison, <hi rend="italic">Delicious</hi> - released in November 2003 - sold 94 870 copies in the same period. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.24">
<s n="s1.3;p8.24">
<hi rend="italic">Good Food</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Delicious</hi> are similar in that they aim to celebrate good quality food. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p8.24">Their emphasis on quality can be seen from the glossy, high quality paper used. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p8.24">Another similarity is in the design and layout; <hi rend="italic">Delicious</hi> describes this as "clean and uncluttered". </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.24">
<s n="s1.4;p9.24">In addition, <hi rend="italic">Good Food</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Delicious</hi> are directed at more or less the same target group; people who are passionate about food and cooking. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p9.24">The majority of this target audience is female - 85% of <hi rend="italic">Delicious</hi> readers are women, and most are aged 25 - 54 (ABC1 profile). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p9.24">From their market research <hi rend="italic">Delicious</hi> concludes that most of their readers are "married...high earning females in full or part-time work". </s>
<s n="s4.4;p9.24">Consequently they are able to spend a reasonable amount of money on food and cooking utensils. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.24">
<s n="s1.3;p10.24">On the other hand, <hi rend="italic">Decanter</hi> ("Britain's leading wine magazine" published by IPC Media) is read by a predominantly male audience; 82% of its readers are men. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p10.24">
<hi rend="italic">Decanter</hi> is somewhat unique in its orientation, because there are few (if any) other magazines dedicated solely to wine in the UK. Again the emphasis is on quality. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p10.24">This is reflected in the print techniques and paper used, together with the magazine's price of ¬£3.40. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.24">
<s n="s1.4;p11.24">The fact that the economic status of readers of <hi rend="italic">Good Food</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Delicious</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Decanter</hi> are so similar suggests a niche in the food and drink magazine market. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p11.24">In 2004 BBC Magazines attempted to reach a broader audience by publishing <hi rend="italic">Easy Cook</hi> quarterly, a food magazine that "focuses on real food for real people". </s>
<s n="s3.4;p11.24">Its lower price of ¬£1.99, compared to ¬£2.90 for <hi rend="italic">Good Food</hi>, suggests a more inclusive target audience. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p11.24">
<hi rend="italic">Easy Cook</hi> focuses on "simple, useful recipes" designed to save time and money. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.24">
<s n="s1.3;p12.24">In conclusion, the food and drink magazine market is more competitive than it initially may seem. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p12.24">Although food and drink is a long-term specialist interest, magazine titles in this area still fluctuate in terms of popularity and sales. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p12.24">Many publications compensate by including other areas of interest - one example is supermarket magazines as discussed earlier. </s>

<head rend="underlined">Section C - 1. Teens</head>
<p n="p13.24">
<s n="s1.4;p13.24">The teenage magazine market is dominated by girl's titles, as teenage boys tend to read magazines on their hobbies and interests. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p13.24">These fall into other magazine markets such as sport, motoring or music. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p13.24">For this reason, this analysis focuses on three significant teenage girls magazines - <hi rend="italic">Bliss</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Sugar</hi> and <hi rend="italic">CosmoGIRL!</hi> </s>
<s n="s4.4;p13.24">. </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.24">
<s n="s1.4;p14.24">Since its launch ten years ago, <hi rend="italic">Sugar</hi> has been the best-selling teenage title in the UK. This has not been the case for the last six months though, as <hi rend="italic">Bliss</hi> outsold <hi rend="italic">Sugar</hi> by 17 010 copies from July to December 2005. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p14.24">This may only be temporary, as <hi rend="italic">Sugar</hi> recently changed to a compact format in January this year. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p14.24">The latest circulation figures published by ABC are; 267 109 for <hi rend="italic">Bliss</hi>, 250 099 for <hi rend="italic">Sugar</hi> and 152 094 for <hi rend="italic">CosmoGIRL!</hi> </s>
<s n="s4.4;p14.24">. </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.24">
<s n="s1.3;p15.24">The circulation figures for teenage magazines are not as high as adult publications; one reason is that the majority of teenagers under 16 are not yet earning. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p15.24">Another reason is that it is common for girls to read their magazines together rather than separately. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p15.24">Consequently, teenage girls magazines are passed around groups of friends, more so than adult magazines are. </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.24">
<s n="s1.9;p16.24">
<hi rend="italic">Bliss</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Sugar</hi> and <hi rend="italic">CosmoGIRL!</hi> </s>
<s n="s2.9;p16.24">are fairly similar in their content and style, including articles on relationships, fashion and celebrity gossip. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p16.24">Each magazine also has an internet site that features quizzes, competitions and horoscopes. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p16.24">Their core buyers are teenage girls aged 12 - 17. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p16.24">There are also other titles in this market aimed at the slightly younger age group of 10 - 14 year old girls. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p16.24">The problem is that these age ranges can be ambiguous. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p16.24">Teenage girls mature rapidly during this period and often choose products that are intended for older age groups. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p16.24">A highly debated issue regarding teenage magazines is that of appropriate content and language. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p16.24">It has been suggested that age restrictions should be printed clearly on the front of magazines, to protect younger girls from inappropriate sexual content. </s>
</p>
<p n="p17.24">
<s n="s1.4;p17.24">The circulations of all magazines in the teenage market are in decline. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p17.24">This may be because teenagers are choosing to spend their money in other areas, such as mobile phones and text messaging. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p17.24">This might explain that fact that in the last five years the teenage magazine market has significantly decreased in its total size. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p17.24">Former publications <hi rend="italic">J17</hi>, <hi rend="italic">19</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ElleGirl</hi> all folded in this period. </s>
</p>
<p n="p18.24">
<s n="s1.3;p18.24">Some publishers including Hachette Filipacchi, the publishers of <hi rend="italic">Sugar,</hi> attribute this to the changing lifestyles, attitudes and experiences of teenage girls. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p18.24">Not only are they maturing faster, but teenagers are becoming increasingly fragmented into many sharply defined groups. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p18.24">Therefore it is hard to find common attitudes and interests among teenagers simply by grouping them in terms of age or gender. </s>
