<s n="s1.4;p1.13">The foundations of the group of historians now known as the <hi rend="italic">Annales</hi> 'school' were laid when in 1929 Marc Bloch and Lucien Febvre published the journal <hi rend="italic">Annales d'histoire économique et sociale</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p1.13">Since this pivotal moment, the <hi rend="italic">Annales</hi> have been credited with undermining the positivist definition of historical fact, destroying the taboo on unwritten evidence, imposing a dialogue with other disciplines, discrediting the history of events, and rejecting the primacy of political history.<ref target="BAWE_0144d-ftnote.001"/> Importantly, this tradition cannot be attributed to a single historian, nor has it employed a 'clear-cut' paradigm.<ref target="BAWE_0144d-ftnote.002"/> 'Their work is united, however, in terms of theoretical and methodological principles embodied in the journal <hi rend="italic">Annales: Économies, Sociétés, Civilisations</hi> whence their name derives." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0144d-ftnote.003"/>
<s n="s3.4;p1.13">Trevor-Roper helpfully captures these elements of unity, emphasising their attempts to grasp the totality and cohesion of every historical period, their conviction that history is at least partly determined by forces which are external to man, and their determination to reduce areas of incomprehension by rigorous statistical analysis.<ref target="BAWE_0144d-ftnote.004"/> Fernand Braudel's contribution to the <hi rend="italic">Annales</hi> tradition, although significant, should be therefore, placed within a wider tradition of conjectural fluidity and development. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p1.13">Far from betraying this tradition, we can credit Braudel with furthering the principle for which the <hi rend="italic">Annales</hi> stood most, promulgating an ideal of <hi rend="italic">histoire totale.</hi> </s>

<quote lang="English">What they saw as the retardation of historical work in France they ascribed to an institution, an attitude, and a deficiency. The institution was the Faculty of Letters of the University of Paris, or more precisely the dominant historians of that faculty. In the interest of the advance of historical studies he [Febvre] felt it must be crushed. Febvre regarded the attitude of the <hi rend="italic">Sorbonnistes</hi> as a symptom of the shrinking timidity of France that emerged in spiritual disarray both from the debacle of 1870 and from the pyrrhic victory of 1914-18.<ref target="BAWE_0144d-ftnote.032"/>
