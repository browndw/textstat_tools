<s n="s1.3;p42.48">With the testing of metallic materials, we found aluminium alloys (E) to be more elastic than iron alloys like steel (DN). </s>
<s n="s2.3;p42.48">Aluminium alloys had a high elastic strain or in other words a lower stiffness when compared with steel. </s>

<s n="s2.4;p44.48">On one hand, while lower strain rates take an awfully long time to fracture the specimen, higher strain rates fracture it too fast. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p44.48">This is due to the viscoelastic property of the polymers.<ref target="BAWE_0358g-ftnote.009"/> We used a low strain rate in the beginning and increased it progressively as we couldn't wait for a long time. </s>
