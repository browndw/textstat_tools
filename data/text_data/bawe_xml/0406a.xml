<s n="s3.6;p1.38">It can be considered the interest rate on dollars held in European banks. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p1.38">A time series of Euro-dollar 6-month deposits was collected from the Federal Reserve website (<seg type="URL" n="http://www.federalreserve.gov"/>) consisting of 753 weekly values spanning from the 1 <hi rend="sup">st</hi> of January 2002 to the 31 <hi rend="sup">st</hi> of December 2004. </s>

<s n="s2.5;p2.38">Over the period the interest rate seems to dip and then increase in level, which might be considered a deterministic trend of the series. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p2.38">However, much of the behaviour appears to be local trends in the data rather than any long-term pattern. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p2.38">The series is non-stationary - it does not fluctuate around any one value, rather the data appears to fluctuate around a local level which changes over time. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p2.38">The series appears to drift over time, which could be an indication of a stochastic trend in the series. </s>

<s n="s3.5;p6.38">This may be a good choice of smoothing parameter but a 'smoother' option may provide a better result. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p6.38">The experimentation with different smoothing parameters suggests that backwards exponential smoothing does not have much effect on interest rate series unless extremely low values of smoothing parameters are chosen. </s>

<p n="p7.38">
<s n="s1.8;p7.38">(ii) Since the time series being considered is an interest rate series, it is inappropriate to log and difference the time series since it is already in percentage format. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p7.38">However, in order to perform further analysis of the time series the local level behaviour of the series must be eliminated so that the series has zero level with no evidence of drift. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p7.38">This is best accomplished by performing a lag 1 regression on the data and examining the residuals from the regression. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p7.38">The regression coefficient produced from the autoregression is 1.0008, very close to 1, and the constant in the regression is approximately zero. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p7.38">Therefore taking the residuals of the regression is very nearly equivalent to subtracting the previous value in the series from the current value, an effect extremely similar to merely differencing the data. </s>

<s n="s2.8;p9.38">There are a large number of extreme values at the ends of both tails of the distribution and the central peak is extremely high. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p9.38">The data is heavily peaked at the centre. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p9.38">There is also a hint of the data being negatively skewed, with slightly more data to the right of the peak and a larger number of low extreme values. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p9.38">These observations are confirmed by examining the skewness and kurtosis values for the residuals series. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p9.38">The series has a slight indication of skewness with a skewness value of -0.14, indicating that the data may have a weak negative skew. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p9.38">The kurtosis value is 6.78, which is quite high and indicates that the data is heavily peaked. </s>

<s n="s2.3;p14.38">Rather than a random spread of the data, there is a large block where most of the values are found and the data seems to conform to a rough cross pattern with some extreme values. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p14.38">This is strong evidence that the residual at time t and the residual at time t - 1 are not independent - there is some low order autoregressive linear correlation in the residuals. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p26.38">The result is slightly surprising. </s>

</p>
<p n="p27.38">
<s n="s1.3;p27.38">This is surprising since one of the stylized facts about interest rate series is that their residuals display volatility and this volatility tends to be greater following high values. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p27.38">Therefore you would not expect the Lowess smoothed line to be symmetric but rather to rise considerably with high values of the residual at time t - 1. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p27.38">This suggests that the volatility in the case of the residuals of the Euro-dollar 6 month deposit rates is not typical of interest rate series on the whole. </s>

</div2>
<div2>
<p n="p28.38">
<s n="s1.5;p28.38">(vii) While a primitive approach to volatility showed consistency with the known behaviour of interest rate series, the comparison does not seem to hold for a conditional variance approach to volatility. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p28.38">In terms of the primitive approach, the residuals of the Euro-dollar 6 month deposit rates series showed peaks of high volatility in the squared residuals, absolute values of the residuals and smoothed squared residuals plots. </s>

<s n="s5.5;p28.38">The scatter plot of the volatility based on the previous residual value showed no evidence of this and did not show particularly clear evidence that volatility was present in the series. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p29.38">There is possibly an explanation for this. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p29.38">The known behaviour of residual interest rates exhibiting high volatility following high values of residuals might be due to increases in interest rates leading to worries over high interest rates affecting spending and profits. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p29.38">However, over the period studied (1 <hi rend="sup">st</hi> of January 2002 to 31 <hi rend="sup">st</hi> December 2004) the interest rate remained at a fairly low level. </s>

<s n="s5.7;p29.38">Looking closely at the graph it is obvious that between 2002 and 2004 the interest rate was generally at a low level compared to the rest of the period. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p29.38">The generally low interest rate may have meant that fears caused by high rises in the interest rate may not have been as problematic as normal, meaning that the usual volatility following high residual interest rates is not present in the period examined. </s>
