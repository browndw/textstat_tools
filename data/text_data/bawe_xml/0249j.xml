<head rend="bold">Introduction</head>
<p n="p2.31">
<s n="s1.6;p2.31">Since the introduction of computers in the design of static and dynamic components in engineering, the Finite Element Method (FEM) has continually developed to become the unparalleled numerical analysis method. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p2.31">First introduced in the 1940's as an analysis tool for structural components in the aerospace industry, the nuclear industry soon found it useful in many applications. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p2.31">The critical requirements for structural integrity justified the very consuming process of the lengthy integrations and calculations involved. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p2.31">Computers began to play a larger and larger role as their computational power increased exponentially. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p2.31">The time involved to model components, and the manual task force required to complete the calculations subsequently dropped off. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p2.31">As computers advanced, the advantages of this technology could be reaped by less wealthy industries and by those with fewer requirements for the achievable high degree of accuracy. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.31">
<s n="s1.1;p3.31">Finite Element Analysis (FEA) has broken down many of the barriers in the design process, integrating the separate entities and bringing the divisions a lot closer. </s>
</p>
<figure id="BAWE_0249j-fig.001"/>
<p n="p4.31">
<s n="s1.5;p4.31">The Design can be modified directly, run through complex numerical testing, the results, and resultant modifications be applied to the computer model and retested before any physical models need be created. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p4.31">At the time of prototyping and testing, the design has now undergone a great deal of analysis, and will be significantly more advanced in its development. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p4.31">This saves time in the lengthy processes of realisation, performing tests, and analysing the implications of each tests results. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p4.31">The cost is cut dramatically with each test as the simulation can be carried out in-house, at cost of labour, without any sourcing or contracting, and without the additional expense of materials and manufacture. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p4.31">Testing by this point of the development process should be more of a formality, as well as a check that the technology of FEA has been correctly applied. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.31">
<s n="s1.5;p5.31">As the design will be a model on the computer, the manufacturing process can take advantage of Computer Aided Manufacture (CAM). </s>
<s n="s2.5;p5.31">This involves Computer Numerical Control (CNC), where geometry incorporated in the computer model is transmitted to machines where it is translated by the machine tools onto the material and the desired product is produced. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p5.31">This allows for a very high degree of accuracy and clearly cuts down the manual labour required reducing costs from the outset. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p5.31">Faster production, self-maintaining machines, and 24 hour production are amongst the advantages offered by integrating Computer Aided Design with manufacture (CAD/CAM). </s>
<s n="s5.5;p5.31">Rapid prototyping can also be employed, allowing designs to be realised even faster and a physical model to be 'printed' off from a computer. </s>

<head rend="bold">How the automotive industry makes use of FEA</head>
<p n="p6.31">
<s n="s1.2;p6.31">The properties of FEA make the technology ideally suited to application in the automotive industry. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p6.31">FEA is utilised in almost every field of the automotive industry: </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p7.31">
<s n="s1.2;p7.31">Clashes - where two or more components are positioned such that they both occupy the same point in space. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p7.31">Such clashes can be highlighted and the space reallocated by rearranging components, either automatically or manually. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p8.31">
<s n="s1.1;p8.31">Aerodynamics - supplementing the use of high-cost wind tunnels, the aerodynamics of a car can be analysed to reduce resistance and losses in turbulence. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p9.31">
<s n="s1.1;p9.31">Fluid dynamics - the behaviour of the various fluids in the engine and fuel tank can be modelled and simulated with the different uses of FEA. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p10.31">
<s n="s1.1;p10.31">Temperature simulation - ensuring a component does not exceed the limiting properties of the material and cause weakness, excessive expansion or failure. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p11.31">
<s n="s1.1;p11.31">Electrical field modelling - allowing engineers to design the vehicle so that charge is directed away from the occupants in the event of lightening strike, or merely static build-up as a result of friction with charged particles in the air during the journey. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p12.31">
<s n="s1.2;p12.31">Stress/strain - originally applied in static applications such as the stresses in supports. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p12.31">More complex models allow dynamic simulations, and most importantly, crash simulations. </s>

<head rend="bold">Theory</head>
<p n="p13.31">
<s n="s1.4;p13.31">FEA, is the implementation of FEM with regard to a particular situation. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p13.31">The theory of FEM is to model any two or three-dimensional shape as multiples of simple polynomials. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p13.31">These polynomials are called 'elements', and the model is meshed into a number of these finite sized elements. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p13.31">The vertices of these elements are called 'nodes', and the edges are called 'splines'. </s>
</p>

<head rend="italic">Examples of 1st order finite elements, followed by their respective 2nd order counterpart. </head>
</figure>
<p n="p14.31">
<s n="s1.5;p14.31">The displacement of each 'element' is then modelled with simple polynomial shape functions, and the displacements of the elements' nodes. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p14.31">Very few components utilise wholly straight edges now, and indeed it is rare that this would be the best shape for the components, as this concentrates stresses, and would be a likely point of failure. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p14.31">As FEM creates an approximation of values, the truer the mesh is to the model, the more accurate the analysis will be. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p14.31">Rather than modelling a radius as a finite number of linear elements (lower, or 1 <hi rend="sup">st</hi> order elements), akin to a curve, nodes can be placed mid-spline, and parabolic functions be applied to explain the geometry of the curve (higher, or 2 <hi rend="sup">nd</hi> order elements). </s>
<s n="s5.5;p14.31">The quadratic equations applied yield better modelling than their linear counterparts as they can adjust to the model bending, without over-simplifying the resultant curved structures. </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.31">
<s n="s1.2;p15.31">Although an increasingly automated process, the meshing of an object is a technical operation, requiring great skill and knowledge to apply a suitable mesh to achieve the required level of accuracy, and with as low a calculation time as possible. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p15.31">The number of finite elements regulates the time required for the calculations to be made. </s>
</p>
<figure id="BAWE_0249j-pic.002"/>
<p n="p16.31">
<s n="s1.1;p16.31">The above diagrams illustrate how users can apply the mesh to optimise the compromises made, and how smaller elements are required in areas of greater detail and complexity. {A} is the simple approach, {B} is extremely complicated whilst {C} concentrates the computations in the main area of interest. </s>
</p>
<p n="p17.31">
<s n="s1.2;p17.31">Without ensuring the relevant areas are suitably meshed, descretisation errors occur, simply meaning that the model is very inaccurate as a result of oversimplification. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p17.31">As with all differential mathematics, the smaller the element the model is divided into, the more accurate the model will be in representing the actual behaviour of the component. </s>

</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="bold">Stress and displacement analysis</head>
<p n="p18.31">
<s n="s1.6;p18.31">Stress can be described as a measurement of the intensity of a force. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p18.31">If this increases beyond the yield point, the material will no longer behave elastically and will permanently deform, and with sufficient intensity, fail. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p18.31">There are two approaches to FEA, using the 'stiffness matrix' and via the 'force matrix' methods. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p18.31">The latter equates the stresses for a known displacement, whereas the stiffness matrix would be used if the displacement is unknown. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p18.31">Simulating the impact of car crashes, the displacement is the unknown, and whilst the force is non-linear, the computer calculates this in incremental steps. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p18.31">This adds a further degree of approximation, reduced by limiting the size of each increment. </s>

<s n="s3.8;p20.31">With the calculated forces, the displacement of each node can be evaluated using the stiffness matrix. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p20.31">When the displacements are evaluated, they are differentiated to give six strain distributions. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p20.31">Three of these mutually perpendicular direct strains &amp; three corresponding shear strains. </s>
