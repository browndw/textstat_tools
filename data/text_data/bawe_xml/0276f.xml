<s n="s2.5;p1.30">What is perhaps most ambiguous is what structural adjustment aims for, recently it has been used as a development tool were initially it sought more to implement macroeconomic reform. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p1.30">In assessing the economic merits of structural adjustment alongside its drawbacks I hope to look beyond the circumstantial evidence to the theoretical frameworks which surround its creation. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p1.30">My argument will focus on the socio-political effects of structural adjustment in contrast to its economic advantages using the evidence from countries (Peru and Zimbabwe specifically) who have experienced structural adjustment as well as purveying the academic literature, especially that of NGO's, assessing the validity of structural adjustment as a tool of development and the different recommendations for its future. </s>

<s n="s3.5;p2.30">In the wake of the global North's acceptance of neo-liberalism, structural adjustment embodies a strong credence to neo-liberal economics; comparative advantage and the deregulation of the market to promote free trade being central themes. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p2.30">It claims that by converting "fundamental economic concepts"<ref target="BAWE_0276f-ftnote.001"/> into policies for developing countries it can create a stable economy for that country and aid its progression towards development, leaving behind their cloak of poverty. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p2.30">However contrasting this theoretical model of structural adjustment to actual results and their effects could indicate a different story. </s>

<s n="s2.3;p5.30">Phase one, otherwise known as "short term macroeconomic stabilisation"<ref target="BAWE_0276f-ftnote.008"/> implements policies which reduce government spending, take existing price regulating controls away and allow the market to devalue. </s>

<s n="s1.10;p6.30">By eliminating government control on interest, exchange rates and the market trade in general structural adjustment aims to boost businesses so that the economy has more investment, domestically and internationally, and is therefore more stable. </s>

<s n="s3.10;p6.30">Meanwhile phase two privatisation gives public services over to companies who make more money to feed into the economy. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p6.30">The emphasis of structural adjustment on export promotion follows a strong liberal ethic as to the economic benefits of comparative advantage. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p6.30">By specialising in one commodity only and ceasing to compete in numerous markets a country can increase export increasing revenues and their percentage of profit whilst creating a stronger market with a growing global repute. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p6.30">This turns developing countries into players in the international trading market making money from exports whilst simultaneously importing for the mutual advantage of all. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p6.30">The move from a stronger market economy to development in terms of income and opportunity for the majority of the population is made, by adjustment economists, through their adherence to trickle down economics. </s>

<head rend="bold">Conclusion of Socio-Political Effects</head>
<p n="p25.30">
<s n="s1.8;p25.30">Before evaluating the costs of structural adjustment in socio-political terms it seems imperative to differentiate between the unavoidable costs born by adjustment in return for economic benefits, in contrast to the effects that adjustment might bring but which are not necessary in order that adjustment occur. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p25.30">To clarify, whilst increased unemployment is a cost of adjustment because of cuts in state services, starvation is an effect because no adjustment policy directly caused its occurrence and it was not a necessary component of the adjustment process. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p25.30">Never the less, as we have seen, such effects can have severe consequences for individuals and institutions alike. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p25.30">The real question is whether these negative effects are necessary, because if they are not the validity of structural adjustment still stands and the only failure is in the formation and implementation of structural adjustment. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p25.30">It appears many of the effects of structural adjustment could have been avoided but a lack of resources, or perhaps more importantly an inaccurate interpretation of the problem, means this has not been the case. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p25.30">Essentially structural adjustment has succeeded in many cases in producing economic success, but the isolated reform of economics has had negative knock on effects for society and politics which also play a large part in economics. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p25.30">It appears structural adjustment addressed only part of the economic problem-developing countries, behind on their debt repayments, were left post-structural adjustment with further debt, a clear sign that both the diagnosis and prescription was lacking. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p25.30">Perhaps what it most alarming about the socio-political effects of structural adjustment that we have considered is that "the social impact could itself frustrate the desired economic effect"<ref target="BAWE_0276f-ftnote.055"/>. </s>

<s n="s1.10;p27.30">It is also important to note that many of the so called 'effects' of adjustment are actually caused by extraneous factors for which structural adjustment is not accountable and cannot control. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p27.30">Developing countries are often the most vulnerable when hit by a global recession, a national drought, regional flooding, earthquakes, terrorist attacks or mere market diminutions and neither national governments nor adjustment can consider in their policies such unprecedented events which influence all areas of life. </s>

<s n="s4.10;p27.30">So too whilst structural adjustment proscribes polices it is national government who implements them. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p27.30">The fact that South Korea successfully 'adjusted' with improvements to the social welfare as opposed to 'social costs' indicates a success for structural adjustment and UNICEF concedes that "growth orientated approaches with structural adjustment have been adopted successfully" <ref target="BAWE_0276f-ftnote.059"/>. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p27.30">So too, as in South Korea where society benefited from structural adjustment, policies can "combine structural adjustment, economic growth, and protection of the human dimension"<ref target="BAWE_0276f-ftnote.060"/>. </s>

<head rend="bold">Adjustment within Development; Perspectives from Development NGO's</head>
<p n="p28.30">
<s n="s1.17;p28.30">Whilst we acknowledge that structural adjustment traditionally aims at economic reform and not development it has been recognised that increasing the BWI have reformed their mission statement so that today it says "Our dream is a world free of poverty"<ref target="BAWE_0276f-ftnote.062"/>. </s>
<s n="s2.17;p28.30">Working from this structure structural adjustment is, in some way, responsible for development as well as for instigating successful and productive economic policies. </s>
<s n="s3.17;p28.30">This leads to a growing link between structural adjustment and human development, in part a link created by IFI's. </s>
<s n="s4.17;p28.30">It is evident that whether it has been acknowledged or not structural adjustment has had an undeniable effect on development and the work of Non-Governmental Organisations (NGO's) in many countries. </s>
<s n="s5.17;p28.30">For this reason it is important to acknowledge their views and contributions on the issue of structural adjustment. </s>
<s n="s6.17;p28.30">Despite the socio-political costs of adjustment and the criticisms of many surrounding macro economic policies, charities and NGO's have consistently acknowledged the need for structural adjustment and it's relevance in many developing countries. </s>
<s n="s7.17;p28.30">UNICEF states that "countries have to adjust to the changing environment" whilst UNCTAD writes that "macroeconomic stability is essential for sustained growth, without which poverty cannot be reduced"<ref target="BAWE_0276f-ftnote.063"/>. </s>
<s n="s8.17;p28.30">However all NGO's emphasise that whilst structural adjustment is necessary the socio-political costs incurred are not and could be avoided. </s>
<s n="s9.17;p28.30">UNICEF's book 'Adjustment with a Human Face' suggests "more gradual timing"<ref target="BAWE_0276f-ftnote.064"/> for structural adjustment with more money available and the introduction of meso-policies to safeguard the vulnerable and poorer sections of society. </s>
<s n="s10.17;p28.30">Finally it emphasises the importance of a continual assessment of living standards. </s>
<s n="s11.17;p28.30">Similarly 'Our Global Government' suggests structural adjustment should be based around "low condition compensatory finance"<ref target="BAWE_0276f-ftnote.065"/> and short term economic provision for countries struggling to pay off debts in the immediate future. </s>
<s n="s12.17;p28.30">Oxfam suggests adjustment could be more beneficial to developing countries if it was based around a series of "incremental steps"<ref target="BAWE_0276f-ftnote.066"/> whereby changes are initiated over a longer period of time avoiding dramatic changes occurring within days and throwing a country into chaos which could further exacerbate any economic difficulty. </s>
<s n="s13.17;p28.30">Finally a report by SAPRIN gives a less satisfying or coherent conclusion for the future of structural adjustment but, arguably, the most enlightened as to the realities of the situation. </s>
<s n="s14.17;p28.30">It suggests that the makers of future adjustment policy need to be those involved with adjustment, "those who are close to, and who understand best, their local and national realities"<ref target="BAWE_0276f-ftnote.067"/>. </s>
<s n="s15.17;p28.30">So, for SAPRIN, what is needed is the "space" <ref target="BAWE_0276f-ftnote.068"/> for those involved to shape their own economic reform. </s>
<s n="s16.17;p28.30">This is suggesting a model of participatory development, defined by Rahnema as a process involving three elements; the cognitive which perceives the realities differently; the political which builds "a bridge between the Establishment and its target populations" by giving a voice to those without; and the instrumental which bring about new ideas of ways to develop<ref target="BAWE_0276f-ftnote.069"/>. </s>
<s n="s17.17;p28.30">This overwhelmingly positive response from NGO's serves to illustrate that they consider structural adjustment has value within development as a theory despite the current negative effects it creates for many countries. </s>

<p n="p29.30">
<s n="s1.9;p29.30">Ultimately structural adjustment cannot be held solely responsible for the sustained poverty in many 'adjusting' countries to which other factors contribute. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p29.30">There is some onus on the institutions dictating and forming the policies of structural adjustment, the national governments who implement the reforms, and unpredicted extraneous causes which cannot be accommodated for in advance. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p29.30">In saying this structural adjustment in practice had resulted in serious socio-political ramifications in real human terms which cannot be ignored. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p29.30">Politically the effects of adjustment are far reaching and imply a lack of sovereignty as well as a move towards a globalisation which makes a country vulnerable as much as it empowers. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p29.30">We have noted the social costs of structural adjustment ranging from physical lack of resources such as food, water, education or healthcare to a more abstract degradation of indigenous cultures and the reinforcement of discrimination within society. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p29.30">What is apparent from this study is that poverty alleviation and macroeconomic reform through structural adjustment do not have to be mutually exclusive terms; economic growth is not incongruous with development as has been shown in a minority of cases (South Korea being a case in point). </s>
<s n="s7.9;p29.30">Adjustment can, in short, exist alongside and compliment the process of development. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p29.30">The social effects of structural adjustment do, in the majority of cases today, outweigh or worse declare void, the economic benefits of adjustment. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p29.30">However there are exceptions to this case and much more evidence which leads us to suggest that the social effects of structural adjustment could be easily avoided making structural adjustment not only viable but a powerful tool for development. </s>
</p>
<p n="p30.30">
<s n="s1.2;p30.30">Adjustment is perhaps the popular porn for attack but what needs to be tackled, in my opinion, is the underlying tradition which separates social development and poverty alleviation from instituting sound macroeconomic reforms within national economies. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p30.30">Thus, as Singer proposed, there needs to be more interaction and better cooperation between the UN and the Bretton Woods Institutions<ref target="BAWE_0276f-ftnote.070"/> in order that practical realistic policies are made for developing countries acknowledging the reality of their situation as well as the centrality of economics to any lasting development. </s>
