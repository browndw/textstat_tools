<s n="s2.6;p1.11">Modern firms are often made up of a number of individuals and are interchangeable with market. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p1.11">Individuals interact with each other in order to make decisions. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p1.11">That's also an obvious difference from the traditional firm as traditional firm only make decision in response to market price. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p1.11">But as there are more small individuals, communication problems arise. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p1.11">Incomplete information and misunderstanding onset conflicts. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.11">
<s n="s1.8;p2.11">The 'principal-agent problem' (P-A problem) takes place when people (principals), as a result of lack of knowledge, cannot ensure that their best interests are ensured by their agents. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p2.11">Then who are the principals and who are their agents? </s>
<s n="s3.8;p2.11">The relationship between the shareholders and its managers is an agency relationship. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p2.11">The shareholders (the principals) want the managers (agents) to act in the shareholders' best interest. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p2.11">We can a software company, Microsoft as an example. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p2.11">The Microsoft Corporation senior managers (the principals) and programmers working on the next version of Windows (agent) is an agency relationship. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p2.11">Microsoft managers want the programmers to work towards their managerial goals. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p2.11">The P-A problem in a firm occurs because it is difficult to monitor the activities of all employees. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.11">
<s n="s1.4;p3.11">In a large company, the flow of information can be slow and misleading. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p3.11">Some firms or some forms of business organization are complex. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p3.11">There is a long chain of connections, interests and procedures from the shareholders. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p3.11">Although this takes up the advantage of division of labour, this also generates two P-A problems: </s>

<list type="ordered">
<item>1. Separation of ownership and control</item>
<item>2. Monitoring and motivation problems</item>
</list>
<p n="p4.11">
<s n="s1.2;p4.11">The separation of ownership from control is a problem if managers pursue different goals from shareholders. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p4.11">Sometimes shareholders (the principals) want the firm to maximize profit but the managers (agents) have their own goals such as maximizing salaries. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.11">
<s n="s1.3;p5.11">The monitoring and motivation problems raise costs and reduce profits. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p5.11">It is more difficult for managers (principals) to monitor their workforce (agents) in complex organizations. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p5.11">Workers' utility falls as they do more work for a given weekly wage and they may do less work if they are not closely monitored by their managers. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.11">
<s n="s1.7;p6.11">Any problems arise within the firm will affect its efficiency and in turn reduce the profit. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p6.11">In order to raise efficiency and avoid the problems of limited information, a rich variety of institutions, contractual relationships and compensation schemes have been devised in business organizations. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p6.11">Actually, the P-A problem cannot be solved just by giving orders and having them obeyed. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p6.11">The firm's owner (principals) must find a way to induce the managers (agents) to pursue the maximum possible profit and the managers (principals) must induce the workers (agents) to work efficiently. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p6.11">The four main ways are ownership, incentive pay, long-term contracts and internal restructuring. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p6.11">The structure and behaviour of the firms are made to minimize the P-A problems. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p6.11">The firm devises incentive mechanisms and structures such that the agents' behaviour is consistent with the objectives of the principal and or the monitoring role is easier. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p8.11">Staff are assessed annually against a wide variety of performance criteria. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p8.11">Many firms reward managers and staff by offering separate bonuses for meeting production or sales targets. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p8.11">These types of incentive pay schemes help focus the goals of all employees on profit maximization, reducing the P-A problem. </s>

</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">Long-term contracts</head>
<p n="p9.11">
<s n="s1.2;p9.11">The contracts tie the long-term fortunes of managers and workers to the success of the owners of the firms. </s>

<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">Internal structure</head>
<p n="p10.11">
<s n="s1.3;p10.11">Monitoring and motivating your workforce is easier in a small organization as the owner is also the manager and knows all the staff personally. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p10.11">By changing the internal structure of the firm, the flow of information and the benefits of team work and specialization can be increased. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p10.11">This also reduces the monitoring costs and makes the performance of one division less dependent on that of another. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.11">
<s n="s1.4;p11.11">Nowadays, large companies always dominate trade although there are more chances for the P-A problem to occur. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p11.11">It is because those companies are large in scale and low cost capital will be available. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p11.11">They have better planning and are easier to carry out the schemes which cope with the P-A problem. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p11.11">Actually solving the P-A problem is one of the means to reduce cost too. </s>
