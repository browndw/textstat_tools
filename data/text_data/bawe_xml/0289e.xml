<s n="s1.5;p1.40">Our company should, as a matter of urgency, look to find alternative suppliers for our products. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p1.40">We should also consider reducing credit terms in order to mitigate any risk in the meantime. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p1.40">The financial stability of Somerfield when compared to Tesco looks precarious and although some performance and profitability metrics have improved over the past year, their position looks precarious. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p1.40">Of concern to us as suppliers are the higher creditor days, but from a wider perspective there are problems with sales margins, profit per employee and returns to shareholders, amongst a number of other things. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p1.40">This company is not in a healthy state and represents a significant supply risk. </s>

<p n="p2.40">
<s n="s1.3;p2.40">This report concerns Somerfield. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p2.40">Approximately 45% of Welsh Bakeries sales are to Somerfield and the company therefore places great reliance on them as a customer. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p2.40">This analysis is being undertaken with the objective of analysing the performance of Somerfield from the perspective of being a major supplier to them, and highlighting any risks or causes for concern which may need to be acted upon. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.40">
<s n="s1.1;p3.40">In order to provide context to the analysis, Somerfield will be compared and contrasted with the market leader in the sector, Tesco, to provide context for the analysis. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.40">
<s n="s1.2;p4.40">The report will contain four sections - Context, Overview, Ratios and Evaluation. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p4.40">This will enable a full analysis of the company in the context of the market that it is operating within which is vital to be able to properly evaluate company performance. </s>

</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p7.40">
<s n="s1.2;p7.40">There is currently an issue with regards planning legislation and out of town superstores. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p7.40">Whilst this could have a negative effect on Somerfield's performance, it's target market and store profile suggest that it will not be as hard hit as some other retailers, for instance Tesco </s>

<div3>
<head rend="underlined italic">Economic</head>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p8.40">
<s n="s1.3;p8.40">Retail in the UK has recently been experiencing a downturn. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p8.40">However, food retailing has largely been cushioned from this blow - it has affected mainly non-food items. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p8.40">This is likely to have a larger impact on Tesco than on Somerfield </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p9.40">
<s n="s1.2;p9.40">Current rises in energy prices are now squeezing consumers and so disposable income is falling. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p9.40">This may have a negative effect on performance, affecting particularly the sales of higher end goods </s>
</p>
</div3>
<div3>
<head rend="underlined italic">Social</head>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p10.40">
<s n="s1.3;p10.40">Concern for the environment is growing. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p10.40">Retailers are responding with plastic bag recycling and incentive schemes, and are also looking at food miles. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p10.40">This is improving the reputation of those that do so (Tesco) potentially to the detriment of those that do not </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p11.40">
<s n="s1.1;p11.40">Conversely, there is a social backlash against large supermarkets, predominantly Tesco, who are being seen to make large profits at the expense of smaller stores </s>
</p>
</div3>
<div3>
<head rend="underlined italic">Technological</head>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p12.40">
<s n="s1.1;p12.40">Advancements in recent years have made it possible for retailers to improve performance and cut costs through EPOS technology and RFID tagging </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p13.40">
<s n="s1.1;p13.40">Loyalty cards and improved EPOS technology has also improved the marketing opportunities for retailers that have chosen to take them, in particular Tesco with their clubcard offering </s>
</p>
</div3>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="bold">Internal Context</head>
<p n="p14.40">
<s n="s1.2;p14.40">As well as considering the external context in which Somerfield operates, it is also important to consider the industry itself, it's structure and the nature of competition. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p14.40">Porters 5 forces analysis will be used to analyse this </s>
</p>
<div3>
<head rend="underlined italic">Power of Suppliers</head>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p15.40">
<s n="s1.2;p15.40">This is low in the industry. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p15.40">A few large organisations are the purchasers, and they can exert their power over suppliers. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p16.40">
<s n="s1.2;p16.40">A cautionary note - there is growing public disquiet over supplier power. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p16.40">Companies in the industry are becoming aware of this and are reacting to it, as a result supplier power may increase in the future </s>
</p>
</div3>
<div3>
<head rend="underlined italic">Power of buyers</head>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p17.40">
<s n="s1.2;p17.40">Again, relatively low. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p17.40">There are an enormous number of buyers in the industry, and none are particularly relied upon. </s>
</p>
</div3>
<div3>
<head rend="underlined italic">Threat of new entrants</head>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p18.40">
<s n="s1.2;p18.40">This is also relatively low. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p18.40">There may be a threat of new entrants on a small scale, but given the barriers to entry (land sites are held by the largest supermarkets, sometimes with the sole purpose of preventing another from building there) and the barriers to exit, significant new entrants are unlikely </s>
</p>
</div3>
<div3>
<head rend="underlined italic">Threat of Substitutes</head>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p19.40">
<s n="s1.4;p19.40">This is a more substantial threat. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p19.40">There are many substitutes to the offering provided by Somerfield and the supermarkets - for instance the local shop. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p19.40">Companies are trying to differentiate themselves by extending product lines away from traditional lines, and their prices are currently difficult to match. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p19.40">It is likely in the future that although there are potential substitutes, people will continue to use supermarkets en masse </s>
</p>
</div3>
<div3>
<head rend="underlined italic">Competitive Rivalry</head>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p20.40">
<s n="s1.1;p20.40">Rivalry in this sector is intense </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p21.40">
<s n="s1.1;p21.40">There are a small number of large companies </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p22.40">
<s n="s1.1;p22.40">The market is large, but relatively homogenous </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p23.40">
<s n="s1.1;p23.40">Consumers are price sensitive </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p24.40">
<s n="s1.1;p24.40">Barriers to entry and exit are high </s>
</p>
<p n="p25.40">
<s n="s1.1;p25.40">These, coupled with the factors above, lead to intense rivalry in the sector, which Somerfield needs to ensure it remains competitive in to survive </s>
</p>
</div3>
</div2>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="underlined bold">Overview</head>
<p n="p26.40">
<s n="s1.1;p26.40">In the Overview section, the key numbers for both Somerfield and Tesco will be presented and discussed. </s>
</p>
<div2>
<head rend="underlined italic">Turnover</head>
<p n="p27.40">
<s n="s1.3;p27.40">This grew by 13% for Tesco and only 2% for Somerfield. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p27.40">Despite the differences in size and strategy of the two businesses, this is clearly cause for concern. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p27.40">2% is below the rate of inflation so in real terms, turnover probably fell in the period </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="underlined italic">Operating Profit</head>
<p n="p28.40">
<s n="s1.2;p28.40">Somerfield have turned around a loss into a modest profit. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p28.40">More information would be required on any exceptional costs incurred in 2001 before a judgement could be made, but although the turnaround looks positive, the absolute profit number is poor and a cause for significant concern. </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="underlined italic">Operating Cashflow</head>
<p n="p29.40">
<s n="s1.2;p29.40">This has declined by 23% in the period and represents a real concern, especially when benchmarked against Tesco's 5% growth. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p29.40">This fall in cashflow would need to be analysed in more detail to discover the drivers behind it </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="underlined italic">Capital Expenditure</head>
<p n="p30.40">
<s n="s1.2;p30.40">The substantial increase would indicate significant expenditure in the year - to enable a full evaluation it would be necessary to understand what was purchased and why, to see if it was to facilitate further business growth or for another reason. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p30.40">Given the other numbers it would seem unusual to increase investment by this much when turnover and profits are precarious. </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="underlined italic">Total number of employees</head>
<p n="p31.40">
<s n="s1.2;p31.40">A 4% reduction for Somerfield indicates a declining business - or it could indicate a cost cutting drive. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p31.40">Compared with the other metrics a decline in employee numbers is probably a good thing, but the growth in Tesco's employees indicate that there were customers there to be had and that Somerfield is potentially losing it's competitive advantage </s>
</p>
</div2>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="underlined bold">Ratios</head>
<div2>
<head rend="bold">Performance ratios</head>
<p n="p32.40">
<s n="s1.7;p32.40">There are some major concerns with the performance ratios for Somerfield. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p32.40">Although they have shown improvement over the past year, compared to the ratios for Tesco there are some major issues. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p32.40">For instance, a sales margin of 0.62% as compared to 5.72% is a sign of underperformance in the sector as well as a business that is only just making money on the goods that it sells. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p32.40">A ROCE on 3.59% is equally poor, especially given the risk that investors are taking with Somerfield as compared to Tesco. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p32.40">A bank deposit account with almost no risk delivers a better return. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p32.40">Asset turnover has improved and is higher than Tesco, but this could indicate a declining business that is not investing in growth and which has cheaply delivered stores, rather than a well-run business. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p32.40">Sales per employee has risen - but this is mostly down to a reduction in employee numbers as opposed to a turnover increase, and profit per employee, at £724 is less than 10% of the comparable Tesco figure. </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="bold">Working Capital ratios</head>
<p n="p33.40">
<s n="s1.7;p33.40">These are of key importance, given our position as a supplier to Somerfield. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p33.40">Stock days, although falling slightly, are approaching double that of the comparable Tesco figure and indicate poor stock management in comparison. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p33.40">Creditor days, again though falling, are a prime concern. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p33.40">42 days is still significantly above the Tesco figure of 34 days. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p33.40">Further, it is likely that the Tesco creditor days is simply shrewd management of cash. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p33.40">Given the Somerfield financial position, it is possible that their figure is not good management, but a lack of ability to pay. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p33.40">This is of course speculation but is a concern given the overall position of the firm </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="bold">Liquidity and Solvency</head>
<p n="p34.40">
<s n="s1.6;p34.40">A similar point applies to the current ratio and Acid test. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p34.40">Tesco does have lower ratios (particularly in relation to the current ratio), but this is not a concern and is likely to reflect good management of resources in a stable, growing company. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p34.40">Somerfield's ratio of 0.79, whilst notionally better, is still a concern for a company in it's financial position and the fact that it has fallen by 8% in one year is a cause for concern. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p34.40">Further, interest cover, again whilst improving, is still relatively low. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p34.40">The gearing of Somerfield indicates that it is almost solely equity funded, whilst that of Tesco indicates a high level of debt funding (not an issue for a firm as stable as Tesco). </s>
<s n="s6.6;p34.40">The high level of equity funding is probably appropriate for a company in the situation that Somerfield is in </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="bold">Shareholders view</head>
<p n="p35.40">
<s n="s1.3;p35.40">As mentioned above, the return on shareholders funds is poor in comparison to Tesco. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p35.40">The earnings per share is also half as much, which will be a concern for investors and also for us as suppliers as to the potential future prospects for the firm. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p35.40">The dividend cover of 5.60 as compared to 2.13 for Tesco is scant comfort as it seems to indicate a lower level of dividend payment rather than financial prudence which, although appropriate for the financial state of the business, potentially does not bode well for the future. </s>
</p>
</div2>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="underlined bold">Evaluation</head>
<p n="p36.40">
<s n="s1.1;p36.40">Bringing each element of the analysis together, as suppliers to Somerfield with the reliance that we have on the company, we should be very concerned about the performance and future prospects for the firm. </s>
</p>
<p n="p37.40">
<s n="s1.4;p37.40">The grocery industry is one which has significant external pressures upon it. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p37.40">Coupled with this is the fact that it is highly competitive and with just a few large companies competing for business. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p37.40">Having said that, the Tesco results show that growth is there to be had - even despite the fact that a large proportion of Tesco's growth is in international markets in which Somerfield does not operate, it's UK business did show significant growth during the period. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p37.40">Somerfield clearly does not have the competitive advantage against Tesco in the sector, and this is a concern for future years. </s>
</p>
<p n="p38.40">
<s n="s1.6;p38.40">The overview and ratio analysis compound this concern. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p38.40">On almost every metric, Tesco outperforms Somerfield. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p38.40">On some metrics, Somerfield is in a particularly precarious position. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p38.40">Shareholder returns are poor and given that the company is almost entirely equity funded, should they choose to sell and move their money elsewhere to get a better return for a lower risk, Somerfield would be in a difficult position indeed. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p38.40">Of special concern are the liquidity and solvency ratios, given our position as a supplier. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p38.40">Somerfield pays consistently later than Tesco and that, coupled with the knowledge of the overall stability of the firm, gives cause for concern. </s>
</p>
<p n="p39.40">
<s n="s1.1;p39.40">More information would be useful in order to more accurately assess Somerfield and Tesco, for example: </s>
