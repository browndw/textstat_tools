<s n="s1.12;p2.17">In section 25 Kant considers how we measure extension. </s>
<s n="s2.12;p2.17">He distinguishes between the mathematical and the aesthetic methods. </s>
<s n="s3.12;p2.17">The question is how we can gain a foundation for our measurements. </s>
<s n="s4.12;p2.17">How do we get an 'absolute' concept of magnitude - how do I get a concept of magnitude that isn't related to other measures in an infinite regress? </s>
<s n="s5.12;p2.17">The problem arises if we try to define the length of a centimetre. </s>
<s n="s6.12;p2.17">We can do so by relating it to other measures: for example, it is one hundredth of a metre, or ten times the length of a millimetre. </s>
<s n="s7.12;p2.17">But then, of course, the question arises as to the definition of this further measure, and any used to answer that question. </s>
<s n="s8.12;p2.17">Kant's solution is to resort to the aesthetic method: we measure an object in comparison to some other constituent of experience. </s>
<s n="s9.12;p2.17">I measure the pyramids in terms of their building blocks, for example, or I measure my sister in comparison to my brother. </s>
<s n="s10.12;p2.17">We can thereby come to some concrete end to our search for definitions which allows us to use mathematical measures practically. </s>
<s n="s11.12;p2.17">If we were not able to relate the length 1cm to some such experience as 'the length of a house fly' we would not be able to use the measure in any but pure mathematical contexts. </s>
<s n="s12.12;p2.17">What is this intended to show? </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.17">
<s n="s1.2;p3.17">Kant's concern is with what can be experienced sensibly. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p3.17">By considering the aesthetic method we can see the limits of the measurement we can carry out in sensible experience. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.17">
<s n="s1.10;p4.17">The aesthetic measurement of magnitude proceeds on two stages Kant calls 'apprehension' and 'comprehension'. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p4.17">The former amounts to the synthesising of parts. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p4.17">In the case of measuring my brother I need to synthesise the part of my brother equal to the height of my sister and the remainder. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p4.17">In the case of measuring a mansion I may have to synthesis twelve parts of the size of the car sitting in front of it. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p4.17">'Comprehension' refers to that act of the mind that grasps the totality. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p4.17">It is important to recognize that these are not temporally distinct moments. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p4.17">Comprehension refers to the holding together of all the synthesised parts, apprehension to the act of synthesising. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p4.17">To comprehend the magnitude I need to be able to hold in synthesis all the parts of the object. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p4.17">A mountain disappearing into the mists above me therefore does not meet this requirement, because all the parts are not available to me to synthesise. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p4.17">The point at which I can no longer hold together the synthesised representations - the point when I begin to lose representations as I apprehend new ones - shows the limit of imagination in thinking magnitude. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.17">
<s n="s1.7;p5.17">It is as well to emphasise that Kant's concern here is with aesthetic measurements of magnitude. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p5.17">For mathematical measurements, "understanding is as well served and as satisfied whether imagination selects for the unit a magnitude which can be taken in at a glance, e.g. a foot, or a perch, or else a German mile, or even the earth's diameter." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0390a-ftnote.001"/>
<s n="s3.7;p5.17">In aesthetic measurements of magnitude we select a measurement - a person, a building block - and size up what we are presented with in experience. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p5.17">But there is a limit to what can be presented this way. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p5.17">If we attempt to represent the magnitude of a vast object - an object that exceeds my ability to comprehend all its representations - we are led to try to find a measure for it. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p5.17">But this we can not do, for no matter how large the measure it cannot allow us to grasp the magnitude of the object. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p5.17">For Kant, this is where reason supplies the idea of the infinite: my imagination is inadequate to cognising a vast object, and as a result the idea of infinity is supplied by the faculty of reason. </s>

<s n="s1.18;p6.17">Kant's claim may seem to be that the <hi rend="italic">measure</hi> we are driven to attempt to use is infinite because the object itself is infinite. </s>
<s n="s2.18;p6.17">This comes up against the simple objection that we are not presented with infinite objects in experience. </s>
<s n="s3.18;p6.17">The infinity of an object is what I add to it's representation in thought. </s>
<s n="s4.18;p6.17">The fact that the night sky is fathomless to my perception does not mean my perception is of it as infinite: I may not be able to grasp its depths in my perception but that is merely to say that it exceeds my perceptive capacities. </s>
<s n="s5.18;p6.17">However, infinity for Kant is only properly predicated of the state of our faculties. </s>
<s n="s6.18;p6.17">Just as beauty is the pleasurable sensation of the free play of the faculties, infinity is the idea evoked by the immensely large in nature. </s>
<s n="s7.18;p6.17">In other words, the failure of the imagination to grasp an object of immense magnitude does not rely on the infinity of that object, merely that it exceeds the ability of our imagination. </s>
<s n="s8.18;p6.17">"True sublimity must be sought only in the mind of the one who judges, not in the object in nature." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0390a-ftnote.002"/>
<s n="s9.18;p6.17">If we read Kant this way we can agree that infinity is added by thought to an immensely large object. </s>
<s n="s10.18;p6.17">"That is sublime which even to be able to think of demonstrates a faculty of the mind that surpasses every measure of the senses." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0390a-ftnote.003"/>
<s n="s11.18;p6.17">In the light of this it is no objection to Kant that he claims that what is sublime is absolutely great.<ref target="BAWE_0390a-ftnote.004"/> To say that something is great is to say that it is so, "grounded in a subjective purposiveness of the representation in relation to the power of judgement." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0390a-ftnote.005"/>
<s n="s12.18;p6.17">In other words, the concept of magnitude implies a relation of the object to the power of judgement of the subject. </s>
<s n="s13.18;p6.17">In the case of aesthetic judgements the measure can be selected by the subject - always implying the relation of the object to the subject as determinative of what can be said of its magnitude (whether it is great or small etc.) up to a certain magnitude. </s>
<s n="s14.18;p6.17">Beyond that magnitude the subject supplies infinity automatically as the sublime. </s>
<s n="s15.18;p6.17">The object is absolutely great means 'I can not grasp an aesthetic measure for this object, it exceeds the capacity of imagination for presenting the world to me'. </s>
<s n="s16.18;p6.17">In fact, from this formulation we can see that the infinite can not be in the world. </s>
<s n="s17.18;p6.17">If that was so our idea of the infinite would be a concept to fit a synthesis of representations of the imagination. </s>
<s n="s18.18;p6.17">It would thus be a product of the understanding, not reason. </s>

<s n="s5.7;p14.17">Consequently the source of our moral nature is superior in power to our sensible nature. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p14.17">In the case of the mathematical sublime reason is shown to be able to think further than the imagination when it comes to estimating magnitude. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p14.17">Again, the implication is that the source of morality is superior. </s>

<s n="s1.9;p15.17">Whether the argument in the dynamic sublime really shows the superiority of reason or its independence is an interesting question. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p15.17">There is not really a sense in which the power of free will can be compared to the power of nature: the one is physical power the other is rational will and commitment. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p15.17">The result is really that no magnitude of physical power in nature can alter the fact that our free will reveals, "a self-preservation of quite another kind than that which can be threatened and endangered by nature outside us." </s>

<s n="s1.5;p16.17">We can consider here as analogous issues the antinomies of the first critique, where the ideas of reason lead us into error. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p16.17">As in the case of those antinomies however, the key to the arguments for the valuation Kant gives to the experience of the sublime is to be found in his system of transcendental idealism. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p16.17">Independently he will argue that the distinction between noumenon and phenomenon when thought through shows the reasonableness of supposing freedom to be sourced from outside of empirical causality. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p16.17">Independently Kant will argue for morality as sourced from reason. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p16.17">The arguments of the analytic of the sublime can therefore only fully be completed and the conclusion of the superiority of reason justified in the light of further work by Kant outside the analytic. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p17.17">However, I think that Kant is committed to claiming more. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p17.17">He believes that the experience of the sublime is universal and necessary to all those subjects who have been educated to recognise their moral natures. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p17.17">Hence Kant wishes to claim that the feeling itself reveals reason's superiority: just as the pleasure felt in the experience of the beautiful is necessarily communicable and hence indicative of a universally shared propensity of the faculties, so must the pleasure felt in the sublime be. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p17.17">The difference is of course that only those with a sufficient moral education will experience the awesome extent or power of nature as sublime and as consequently showing the superiority of their rational natures. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p17.17">The nature and quality of the feeling itself - the feeling of the superiority of our rational natures - is its own deduction. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p17.17">Hence one who does not recognise this feeling or does not ascribe it the significance Kant does must fall back on one of two options: either accept the above claim that the justification of the claim of the superiority of reason lies outside the analytic; or conclude their moral education was poor. </s>
