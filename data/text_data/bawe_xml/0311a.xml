<p n="p5.79">
<s n="s1.4;p5.79">High resistivities will mean it is harder for electrons to travel through that material. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p5.79">These are more of an insulator than a material with a lower resistivity. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p5.79">The coefficient of resistivity is a fundamental property of that material, whereas resistance is merely a property of that particular material in that particular environment. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p5.79">Having known values for resistivity of common materials will help engineers to select a material based on its conductiveness so they can best design their project. </s>

</p>
<p n="p10.79">
<s n="s1.3;p10.79">In a metal this mobility factor becomes the limiting one, as there are copious free electrons (charge carriers) to not cause any significant impact to the resistivity. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p10.79">The main cause of the lack of mobility is the lattice vibrations of the metal itself. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p10.79">Note these aren't the vibrations of the bonds, which you can visualise by the atoms moving away from and closer to each other in a periodic fashion, but is the lattice moving as a whole, up and down, as the electrons try to 'fly' between the planes. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.79">
<s n="s1.5;p11.79">As temperature decreases these lattice vibrations, known as "phonons" decrease as the metal has less energy. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p11.79">Therefore at 0°K the resistivity should be zero and the material a superconductor. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p11.79">However, there are also other features that cause the mobility of the charge carriers to be decreased. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p11.79">Consider a metal that is imperfect, such as it has impurities and defects in the lattice itself. </s>

<s n="s1.1;p12.79">These last two mobility effectors are constant with respect to temperature whereas phonons are proportional to temperature, so we can write: </s>

<s n="s3.4;p15.79">It is suitable at high temperatures, but at low temperatures the impurity/defect concentration outweighs this and so the graph for <hi rend="italic">ρ(T)</hi> is not linear below a particular temperature. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p15.79">Please note that this temperature is less than the boiling point of liquid nitrogen. </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.79">
<s n="s1.2;p16.79">Because of this non-linearity it is unjust to extrapolate back to 0°K from datapoints taken at high temperatures. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p17.79">As mentioned in (1) resistivity is a combination of factors. </s>

<s n="s3.6;p17.79">Changing the length or area changes the resistance through that material. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p17.79">This would require multiple samples of the material, and as purity can vary this method is subject to large errors. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p17.79">Also, if only one sample of this material existed it would be impractical to vary area or length. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p18.79">The method of least errors involves having length and cross-sectional area fixed for each sample. </s>

<s n="s3.7;p18.79">Passing a current through the sample and noting the potential drop across the sample can accomplish the measuring of resistance. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p18.79">This potential drop is caused by energy being used by the electrons to get through the material as it vibrates. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p18.79">Thus we expect more vibration to cause more of a potential drop. </s>

<quote lang="English">"Thermal emfs are generated by diffusion of electrons from one region of a wire to another under the influence of relative heating, or cooling, of the relative regions. The resultant distribution of electrons as a result of heat produces a voltage distribution along the wire that is proportional to the relative temperature of the wire. As the thermally-induced electron diffusivity is a physical characteristic of the material used to make the thermocouple wire, two materials with different electron diffusivity will produce a voltage when they are joined as a thermocouple and heat is applied to the joint relative to the other end. This distribution of electrons as a function of temperature and the resultant voltage is termed the Seebeck Effect." <hi rend="sup">[1] </hi>
