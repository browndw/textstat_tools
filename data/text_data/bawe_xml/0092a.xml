<p n="p65.66">
<s n="s1.4;p65.66">Three main theoretical differences are at the base of the diverging views relating to growth: (a) <hi rend="italic">decreasing returns to scale</hi>, (b) <hi rend="italic">the existence of steady state levels</hi> towards which economies converge and (c) <hi rend="italic">the</hi> <hi rend="italic">determinants of long term economic growth</hi>. (a) </s>
<s n="s2.4;p65.66">Econometric literature overall supports the neoclassical idea of decreasing returns to scale, which are unlike initially assumed encompassed by both the growth of physical and human capital. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p65.66">The Solow model seems to find support on the idea of (b) conditional convergence as well. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p65.66">Simple scatter graphs and Romer, Mankiw and Weil show that homogeneous countries do tend to grow in different paces, which lets them all converge towards one steady state. </s>
</p>
<p n="p66.66">
<s n="s1.2;p66.66">Concerning (c) the determinants of long run growth, it seems as though endogenous growth theorists have a more valid explanation by emphasising that growth can come from structural changes within the economy. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p66.66">Growth is thus not an external factor forced upon an economy, but much more a consequence of its policies, structures and behaviour. </s>
