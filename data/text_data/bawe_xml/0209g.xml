<s n="s8.12;p3.12">Intended to achieve uniformity for economic efficiency, it closely linked environmental and economic policy, recognising that stricter environmental principles may limit trade, consequently condoning regulation. </s>

<s n="s10.12;p3.12">Article 308, used for purer environmental directives, accomplished objectives that existing provisions could not realise, even if these objectives were unacknowledged in treaty provisions. </s>
