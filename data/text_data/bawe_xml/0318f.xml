<s n="s1.14;p1.13">The rise and fall of the Third Reich had the most profound of consequences for the Czechoslovak lands and people.<ref target="BAWE_0318f-ftnote.001"/> Sacrificed by their allies Britain and France in a futile attempt to avoid war by ceding substantial Sudetenland territory in the Munich Settlement of 29 September 1938, full occupation was really only a matter of time. </s>
<s n="s2.14;p1.13">Beginning on the night of 15 March 1939, official Nazi occupation of Bohemia and Moravia endured until 13 May 1945. </s>
<s n="s3.14;p1.13">Nazi dominance over the region was one of the darkest periods in Czechoslovak history, and Czechoslovak leaders had only limited scope to protect their nation and its population. </s>
<s n="s4.14;p1.13">Edvard Beneš (1884 - 1948) and Emil Hàcha (1872-1945) were two of the best-placed figures to fight for the survival of their republic and its people during the occupation. </s>
<s n="s5.14;p1.13">Beneš was the Czech politician and diplomat who had been a leader of the Czechoslovak independence movement, and became the second President of the republic. </s>
<s n="s6.14;p1.13">He resigned on 5 October 1938, and became leader of the government-in-exile in London during the Naxi occupation.<ref target="BAWE_0318f-ftnote.002"/> Meanwhile, the celebrated Czech legal mind Hàcha reluctantly accepted the position of was Beneš' successor, who became President of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. </s>
<s n="s7.14;p1.13">Beneš was recognised as the figurehead, with his role being to fight for the legal continuity and territorial integrity of the republic after the war, while Hàcha was more concerned with protecting the population during occupation, all the while subordinating his actions to Beneš direction as part of his foreign policy strategy. </s>
<s n="s8.14;p1.13">The complexity and difficulty of the situation for these two men cannot be overstated. </s>
<s n="s9.14;p1.13">Geopolitics far greater than the power of a Czechoslovak republic threatened to thwart every effort made by the outstanding political tactician that was Beneš throughout. </s>
<s n="s10.14;p1.13">The blood of millions of Czechoslovaks was potentially the responsibility of Beneš, and to a more immediate extent, Hacha, with every word written or spoken by him under the auspices of the Nazis inside the Protectorate. </s>
<s n="s11.14;p1.13">It is certainly not the place of the author to seriously judge either of these men in their unenviable struggles. </s>
<s n="s12.14;p1.13">Yet, their strategies and actions can be evaluated with respect to whether they interpreted the needs of their people well, and their success can be considered too. </s>
<s n="s13.14;p1.13">The following enquiry will be primarily concerned with the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, and 'Czech' people will be taken to mean ethnic Czechs, who were by far the majority of the Protectorate's population. </s>
<s n="s14.14;p1.13">Diaries and memoirs, minutes of official meetings, accounts of conversations, letters and memoranda, and communist reports and despatches, from Czech, German, British, American, and Soviet political figures will be used to determine the strategy and success of Edvard Beneš and Emil Hàcha in protecting the interests of the Czech people under Nazi occupation. </s>

<s n="s1.2;pn1.1">The First Republic consisted of the territories Bohemia, Moravia-Silesia, Slovakia, and Sub-Carpathian Ruthenia and was in existence between 1927 and 1938. </s>

<p n="pn1.1">
<s n="s1.6;pn1.1">In his radio address on 5 October 1938 Beneš, 'aware that his presence represented at that time an insuperable obstacle to Czechoslovakia's good relations with Germany' took the immediate step of exile. </s>

<s n="s3.6;pn1.1">When the Protectorate was created Beneš encouraged the Protectorate government to remain in office firstly to ensure the survival of a Czech army, secondly to provide ready administration in the event of a German collapse, and thirdly to prevent the communists filling a power vacuum. </s>
<s n="s4.6;pn1.1">So Beneš did, therefore, legally resign as president of the Czechoslovak republic. </s>
<s n="s5.6;pn1.1">As Jaromir Smutný suggested, Beneš achieved an impressive propaganda coup by convincing the Allies that he was rightful leader of a postwar republic. </s>

<s n="s1.8;p2.13">Both Beneš and Hàcha began their roles as protectors of the republic and its people on shaky ground. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p2.13">Beneš at once faced a struggle to acquire recognition as a president-in-exile, because he was the living reminder of the British and French betrayal at Munich. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p2.13">However, he was energetic and made himself not only visible, but also useful, to the Allies. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p2.13">The legal anomaly that he was not actually the Czechoslovak president was not so much overcome as overlooked,<ref target="BAWE_0318f-ftnote.003"/> depending on how far Benes was in favour with Britain, the United States and the Soviet Union at any one time. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p2.13">By late 1939 Beneš had secured British and French recognition of a Czechoslovak national committee, and had also overseen the establishment of a Czechoslovak army in France. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p2.13">Once Beneš had installed himself as principal diplomat for the Czechoslovak republic, his principle objectives were to acquire official diplomatic recognition of his government-in-exile, to be followed by confirmation by both the Western and Eastern powers of the legal continuity of the Czechoslovak republic after the defeat of the Third Reich, which included the repudiation of the Munich settlement. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p2.13">In addition, Beneš needed to create a meaningful place for himself in the future world order to ensure the long-term survival of an independent republic, which had had previously proved so short-lived. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p2.13">He would do so through being a useful source of information for anxious powers, an impressive diplomat and mediator, head of potential Czech armed forces, and head of security apparatus willing to supply the Allies with intelligence. </s>

<p n="pn1.1">
<s n="s1.1;pn1.1">It 'was legally difficult to reconcile Beneš' claim to uninterrupted presidential continuity and constitutional permanence with his own resignation in 1938, the selection of a new president, the formation of a new government, and important consitutional changes.' (H. Gordon Skilling, 'The National Liberation in World War II', <hi rend="italic">Slavonic and East European Review</hi>, 39 (Dec., 1960), 180.) </s>

</note>
<p n="p3.13">
<s n="s1.5;p3.13">Although Beneš was tireless in his campaigning, major diplomatic successes were usually decided by decisive events in the war. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p3.13">It was only in the aftermath of the fall of France, in July 1940, that a provisional Czechoslovak government and parliament were recognised. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p3.13">The British, at this point, still refused to agree to future territorial arrangements.<ref target="BAWE_0318f-ftnote.004"/> Similarly, when the Soviet Union entered the war in June 1941 a treaty of mutual assistance was signed with the provisional government, which finally afforded the London Czechs with full diplomatic recognition.<ref target="BAWE_0318f-ftnote.005"/> The repudiation of Munich was Beneš' next important objective. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p3.13">It was Molotov for the Soviet Union who was first to indicate that this would be realised. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p3.13">In a conversation in June 1942 the commissar assured Beneš that the Soviet Union did not recognise Munich or anything that had happened to the Czechoslovak republic since. </s>

<p n="p4.13">
<s n="s1.6;p4.13">On the other hand, the main example of these powers responding to the Czech' leader's initiative was the repudiation of Munich, which resulted from Operation Anthropoid. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p4.13">Beneš was acutely aware that the Protectorate government would be a liability to his diplomatic efforts if it were perceived to be a tool of the Nazis, full of self-serving quislings.<ref target="BAWE_0318f-ftnote.006"/> Once Beneš had decided that Hacha's collaborationism was worrying the Allies, he settled on a dramatic gesture of resistance against the Nazi occupiers was needed to vindicate the Czechs. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p4.13">On 27 May 1942 two Czech assassins, who had been supported by an underground network in Britain and the Protectorate, attacked the Nazi leader in the Protectorate Reinhard Heydrich, who died a week later. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p4.13">In addition to ensuring that every participant and underground assistant to the assassins was killed, the Nazis completely destroyed the towns of Lidice and Ležáky. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p4.13">It was these heavy recriminations against the Czechs in its aftermath, rather than the actual gesture of assassination, which convinced Britain to officially repudiate Munich in August. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p4.13">The price that Beneš required of his people in order to ensure the territorial continuity of the post-war republic was certainly higher than he had predicted, but he would have been willing to pay it nonetheless. </s>

<s n="s3.9;p5.13">Representing Poland was certainly in the Czechoslovak national interest. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p5.13">Between November 1940 and mid-1942 Beneš and Sikorski increasingly moved towards a confederation - a powerful Eastern European bloc.<ref target="BAWE_0318f-ftnote.007"/> However, Beneš coldly neglected this alliance once it was clear the Stalin disapproved.<ref target="BAWE_0318f-ftnote.008"/> More ambitiously, Beneš aspired to be the bridge between West and East. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p5.13">Convinced that the Soviet Union would emerge from the war as a moderate European great power, Beneš shifted his allegiance more towards Stalin. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p5.13">Beneš effectively was the dictator's champion to the United States, particularly during his visit to Washington between May and June 1943.<ref target="BAWE_0318f-ftnote.009"/> His advising Roosevelt about the Poles and Soviet Union was rewarded by the president agreeing to the transfer of the German population out of the post-war republic. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p5.13">Beneš was valued in Moscow too in December. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p5.13">After working hard to persuade Britain, Beneš was able to enter into the Soviet-Czechoslovak Treaty.<ref target="BAWE_0318f-ftnote.010"/> Beneš saw himself as the broker of the Soviet Union's entry into a future stable balance of power in Europe, but the pact was more important to him and the Czech people because it contained the implication that there would be no possible communisation and Sovietisation after the war. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p5.13">For all of his foresight and efforts, Beneš was too optimistic about there being room for him and an independent Czechoslovak republic in the new world order. </s>

<p n="p6.13">
<s n="s1.14;p6.13">Beneš' diplomatic manoeuvres were undoubtedly impressive, and it is difficult to imagine any man being more successful than he in achieving his objectives. </s>
<s n="s2.14;p6.13">However, his tireless efforts resulted in serious failures too. </s>
<s n="s3.14;p6.13">The most grave was, of course, his failure to prevent Czech communists from gaining a following and power during, and especially in the aftermath of, the war. </s>
<s n="s4.14;p6.13">Once the Soviet Union entered on the side of the Allies on 22 June 1941, the Czech communists in Moscow, the government-in-exile, and the Czech underground did achieve a substantial degree of unity in their resistance to the Nazis, but politically they were antagonistic. </s>
<s n="s5.14;p6.13">Fierlinger reported to the exile government on 4 January 1942 that 'Some pseudo-liberal regime will not have the support in Moscow that is expected." </s>

<s n="s8.14;p6.13">Yet, his positive feelings towards the Soviet Union were too great an influence on Beneš. </s>

<s n="s10.14;p6.13">His secretary Taborsky regarded the December 1943 treaty as Beneš' greatest misinterpretation. </s>
<s n="s11.14;p6.13">'Beneš did misread Stalin's psyche, place too much trust in his assurances, and misinterpret his real intentions." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0318f-ftnote.014"/>
<s n="s12.14;p6.13">Another painful example of Benes' powerlessness was the affair over Sub-Carpathian Ruthenia beginning in October 1944.<ref target="BAWE_0318f-ftnote.015"/> By the end of 1944, despite being treaty-bound to non-interferece, the Soviets began to see the Czech communist leader Klement Gottwald as Beneš replacement. </s>
<s n="s13.14;p6.13">In a letter to Fierlinger on 30 December 1944, Beneš was essentially resigned to recognising the Lublin Committee as the future government.<ref target="BAWE_0318f-ftnote.016"/> The loss of Sub-Carpathian Ruthenia indicated that policy had swung more to the East than Beneš had envisaged. </s>

<s n="s7.12;p13.13">Yet, this had more to do with the population being so instrumental to war production for the Reich, rather that the ability of their president to temper Nazis. </s>

<s n="s9.12;p13.13">His death would have been a symbolic martyrdom, but most probably a futile action, as he would have been replaced by someone even less irritant to the occupying regime, and therefore less of a protector of the Czech people. </s>

<s n="s11.12;p13.13">It is so important to examine cases such the actions of Beneš and Hàcha because they are an interesting case of a sophisticated interaction between exiled and occupied government stuctures. </s>
