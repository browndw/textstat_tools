<s n="s6.8;p2.15">However, the firms in the music industry more often vie to increase their market shares. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p2.15">They compete in terms of quantity (Cournot competition), which means that price is higher than Pc at Po, and quantity is below Xc at Xo. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p3.15">The major record labels have maintained their oligopoly by erecting high barriers to entry into the market. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p3.15">They have undergone vertical integration by taking possession of industries throughout the music supply chain, including distribution companies, retail sale of recordings, and manufacturing; this places high start-up costs on incoming firms. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p3.15">The oligopolists also have rigid control of the radio media, so that new firms face high marketing barriers. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p3.15">Due to their size, the "big four" further enjoy economies of scale and can fend off decreasing returns to scale for longer than independent labels. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p3.15">This situation discourages smaller firms from competing in the existing music market and explains the oligopolistic structure of the industry. </s>

<p n="p4.15">
<s n="s1.8;p4.15">Worryingly for consumers, the oligopolists are beginning to consolidate. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p4.15">After a Polygram and MCA merger in 2000<ref target="BAWE_0138h-ftnote.008"/>, the EU allowed Sony and BMG to merge in 2004<ref target="BAWE_0138h-ftnote.009"/>, and EMI, Warner Music, Sony and Bertelsmann are currently seeking approval for new planned mergers.<ref target="BAWE_0138h-ftnote.010"/> If the four firms merge, they may transform the music industry into a monopoly, with only one producer of records. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p4.15">This could reduce production costs due to increased economies of scale: indeed, EMI estimates that it could save 360 million pounds annually by merging with Warner<ref target="BAWE_0138h-ftnote.011"/>. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p4.15">However, the creation of a monopoly may also be a danger for the industry. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p4.15">In a monopoly, the price-making firm chooses to produce at the profit-maximising output where its marginal cost equals its marginal revenue. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p4.15">In Fig2, prices are therefore pushed up to Pm, far above the productively efficient price Pc, and quantity falls from Xc to Xm. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p4.15">Price is yet higher than in an oligopolistic structure, with a lower level of output, and the monopolist enjoys abnormal profits . </s>
<s n="s8.8;p4.15">The quality of the product could also drop: unmotivated by competition, the monopolist need not invest in finding new artists, and could offer consumers a reduced choice of music. </s>

<s n="s2.4;p11.15">File sharing could even have a positive effect on CD sales: if the new indifference curve on E' is located at IC''', with equilibrium <hi rend="italic">d</hi> lying to the left of <hi rend="italic">a</hi>, the individual consumes more physical records than previously (y increases to y'''). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p11.15">In the move from IC to IC''', the substitution effect <hi rend="italic">s</hi> is cancelled by the income effect <hi rend="italic">i</hi>, which works in the opposite direction. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p12.15">Oberholzer and Strumpf offer an alternative explanation for the positive impact of piracy on CD sales. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p12.15">They find that 60% of file sharers use downloading to sample music, which leads to them buying at least one CD<ref target="BAWE_0138h-ftnote.028"/>. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p12.15">One must also note that pirated music is not the only available substitute for CD's; other forms of entertainment, such as DVD's and gaming, may also draw consumers away from records. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p12.15">Thus, the decline of the physical music market cannot be attributed entirely to piracy. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p13.15">Factors such as changes in consumer income may also explain the fall in sales. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p13.15">When income increases, the consumer's budget constraint shifts outwards (E to E' in Fig6), and one would expect the quantity demanded of most goods to rise (the consumer moves from <hi rend="italic">a</hi> on IC to <hi rend="italic">c</hi> on IC'', where the quantity consumed of CD's has risen from X to X''). </s>
<s n="s3.7;p13.15">Indeed, a "strong positive effect of income on CD purchases" has been observed in Europe<ref target="BAWE_0138h-ftnote.029"/>. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p13.15">However, the opposite relationship exists in the United States, where falling sales have been accompanied by annual 3% growth in GDP<ref target="BAWE_0138h-ftnote.030"/>. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p13.15">In this case, the consumer shifts to equilibrium <hi rend="italic">b</hi> on IC' to the left of <hi rend="italic">a</hi>, and the rise in income causes a drop in CD consumption (from X to X'). </s>
<s n="s6.7;p13.15">This means that while CD's are normal goods<ref target="BAWE_0138h-ftnote.031"/> for European consumers (the income consumption curve ICC'' is downwards-sloping), they are considered inferior in the United States (ICC' slopes upwards). </s>
<s n="s7.7;p13.15">Consumer constraints alone cannot explain the drop in CD sales, and variations in consumer preferences must therefore also be taken into account. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p14.15">In the music industry, consumer preferences are greatly influenced by age: Boorstin (2004) finds that areas in the United States where most of the population is older than 24 have high CD sales, while those with a majority of younger inhabitants suffer from "significantly decrease[d]" sales.<ref target="BAWE_0138h-ftnote.032"/> There indeed seems to be a "graying of the music audience"<ref target="BAWE_0138h-ftnote.033"/> as younger individuals turn to digital music substitutes. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p14.15">While the median age of music buyers was approximately 23 in 1989, it was almost 32 by 2000; moreover, consumers above 40 years of age account for most purchases in the over-32 group<ref target="BAWE_0138h-ftnote.034"/>. </s>
