<s n="s2.4;p25.28">There can be no doubting that the Judaeo-Christian theology had a hugely significant impact upon the development of the early common law. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p25.28">The Judaeo Christian theology provided the common law with its legitimacy and its influence is seen throughout the early ecclesiastical courts and in the teachings at the Inns of Court. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p25.28">The Judeao-Christian theology was fundamental to developing the common law through the teaching at the Inns of Court and provided common lawyers with a theoretical basis to defend the common law against the imperium of the King. </s>
</p>
<p n="p26.28">
<s n="s1.2;p26.28">Similarly the Graeco-Roman Tradition allowed common lawyers to rely upon an alternative source of legitimacy to battle the Kings prerogative powers. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p26.28">Although such a belief appears to be contradictory to the indivisibility of God and law, many common lawyers believed in the Coalescence of the two theologies, creating a divine based law, advocating ideals of citizenship and the welfare of the state. </s>
</p>
<p n="p27.28">
<s n="s1.4;p27.28">Finally there is the importance of the image and antiquity of common law. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p27.28">In analysing these three influences a common theme arises of a protection of the common law, rather than a development. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p27.28">All three theologies sought to protect the common law from the imperium of the King and the tyrannical rule of the Commonwealth and Protectorate. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p27.28">The Judeao-Christian influences within the Inns of Court helped to develop the common law through oratory, teaching and dining and created a body of lawyers and a utopian state. </s>
</p>
<p n="p28.28">
<s n="s1.3;p28.28">When deciding upon which was the most important influence, the historical antiquity of the common law is surely the most deserving. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p28.28">The significance of the immemorial nature of the common law is not a tangible matter, but a utopic ideal. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p28.28">In creating a legitimacy and faith in the law so strong, as demonstrated by the fervent support from the likes of Fortescue and Coke this has created a legitimacy and a legacy which one can only hope will last forever. </s>

<hi rend="italic">"we must not hold antiquity to be that which is old, nut that which is oldest..... antiquity has no bounds, no limits, it signifies the ages of an indefinite time.....which indefinite time tough in itself it passes by all things created, and rests only in that infitnite majesty, beyond whom there is no time, without whom there is no being, for whom there lieth no appeal."</hi>
