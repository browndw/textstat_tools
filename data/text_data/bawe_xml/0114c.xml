<quote lang="English">What are the effects of interventions initiated by healthcare professionals, aimed at female victims of domestic violence? Individual, couple, or group counselling Two controlled trials and one comparative cohort study found no effect of counselling compared with no treatment on medical care utilisation rates, reported exposure to violence and threats of violence, or depression, state anxiety, and self esteem. One controlled trial found that grief resolution orientated counselling improved self-esteem and self-efficacy from baseline, whereas feminist orientated counselling did not. However, the study did not directly compare effects of interventions. Similarly, one controlled trial found that cognitive behaviour orientated therapy improved women's assertiveness and reduced exposure to abuse from baseline, whereas non-specific support did not. One RCT and one non-randomised controlled trial reported that gender specific or couple therapy reduced subsequent exposure to violence among couples from baseline, but found no significant differences between these two types of counselling [1]. Advocacy One RCT and one non-randomised controlled trial found that advocacy reduced reabuse compared with no treatment. The RCT also found an improvement in women's quality of life with advocacy compared with no treatment. One controlled trial in pregnant Hispanic women found no significant difference in rates of reabuse between combined counselling plus mentoring (similar to advocacy) and a resource card, but found that counselling plus mentoring slightly reduced rates of reabuse compared with unlimited counselling [2]. Shelters We found no reliable controlled trials. One cohort study found a reduced incidence of violence in the weeks after shelter stay for women choosing to use the shelter when they were also engaged in other types of help seeking behaviour compared with women not choosing to stay at the shelter. Women choosing to stay at the shelter who had not sought help elsewhere experienced an increase in violence [3]. Peer support groups We found no systematic reviews, RCTs, non-randomised controlled trials, or cohort studies of peer support groups in women experiencing domestic violence [4].</quote>
