As BzMA is larger than MMA it has a larger steric hinderance and so the longer BzMA is in the reaction mixture the more effect it has on reducing the rate of the reaction, therefore Polymer 5C should have a slower rate of reaction as it had the BzMA in the reaction solution 2 hours earlier than Polymer 5D. </s>

<p>This is confirmed from the rates of the reactions calculated. The rate of reaction for Polymer 5C is 0.001265 whereas polymer 5D has a greater rate of reaction of 0.001397.</p>
<p>The PDi's of the polymers increased as Mn did. This trend was the same throughout the 5 polymers. However, there seems to be a link with a very large PDi and the addition of BzMA to form the block copolymer. The introduction of a second monomer to the reaction obviously has a dramatic effect on the PDi of a polymer.</p>
